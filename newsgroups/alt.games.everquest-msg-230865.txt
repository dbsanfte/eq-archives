Early on, I loved FV and wandering around the edge of town.  The run
up the river to LoIO was always an adventure back then too.

When SoL first came out, was with some friends in Tenebrous.  I
remember when we all noticed the planet *looming* over us - we all
ooh'd and aah'd at about the same time.  I love that view.

Sitting on the Spec Tower in Oasis surveying the zone is always fun
too.  :-)
