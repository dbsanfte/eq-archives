What'e a "prue" caster class?  A stuck up caster?

SOE?  At 13/14?  How the hell did you do that?  Spirit of Eagle is 45 (or is
it 43?) plus only.

Pure BS.  You may have it in the beginning if you went begging in PoK before
heading out, but it will fade long before you've finished your
raid/camp/trip to the planes unless you have a 60-plus enchanter with you.
If you go running off to get KEI every time it fades, you won't have to
worry about being an asset to your group any longer, they'll kick you out.

Christ!  I just realized!  A shammy and you *NEED* Kei?  Ever hear of
Canadancing?  You can regen mana faster with Cannibalize than you can with
KEI.  With Form of the Great Bear/Regrowth on and Canadance III (Kind of
like Breakdancing), you should have no worries about Mana/HPs.

Why do you need KEI?  Haven't learned how to conserve mana?  Want to have
the Cana slot for a Nuke?  Why?
