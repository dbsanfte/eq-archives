Or alternatively you can "march" a mob up and down so everybody htis it from
behind, and half your raid isnt taking riposte damage

Alternatively again you can pin the mob into a corner, with the MA shrunk in
the corner first, so the mob has his back to everybody, and can't be pushed
anywhere

I see lots of people say "start nuking at 60-70%" but honestly, unless your
wizards are stupid, they can nuke from 95+% and not agro/ping pong the mob.
Wizards learn whats enough to ensure maximum damage without getting summoned
and killed, let them be the judge of when to nuke

If the mob rampages then you either send the MA and SA out together, or deal
with the fact rampage is going to be on one of your healers
