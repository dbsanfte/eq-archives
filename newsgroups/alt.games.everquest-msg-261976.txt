iirc when the familiers first came out (Luclin?)
a) They couldn't be banished.
b) They would draw attacks sometimes.
c) Having your familier get itself killed was a VERY bad idea. (I could 
be wrong there)
Which is why the Wizards got buffs for them, and
d) Flappy got annoying really quick too...

To make them less of a nusiance SoE slowly made them less likely to get 
killed (couldn't draw agro at all, for example), made it where losing 
your familier didn't screw you over as badly, then finally made them 
into a buff you could make go away (since they took a slot anyway, what 
was the point of having flappy, right?)
