Never had a horse, have a lizard.  I understand that if you shrink yourself 
with a horse, you will not have the horses head problem.  I believe the 
lizards are more expensive, have not really compared prices.  I love my 
lizard, extra mana regen is great in outdoor zones.  He does eat like a 
horse though, so food and water disappear at an alarming rate.  I rarely 
use it when soloing because it's so slow, and I spend most of my time 
sitting while soloing anyway.
