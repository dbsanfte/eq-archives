True for you (and me, for that matter).  Not true for everyone.   I can
imagine reasonable people who consider the first 20 levels a grind.  If
I decided I want to play another class, I'd be tempted to skip the first
newbie levels if it were cheap and convenient enough.

De gustibus non est disputandum.  What's fun for you may not be for everyone,
or even for you the second or fifth time you do it.  I don't have any friends
who are in "sit and grind" mode yet, but the highest is only 34, so who knows
what will happen.

Personally, I like some parts of the game that others consider a grind.
Joining a group to clear an area for xp and/or drops is fun, with the right
mix of people.  I've never fully understood why anyone would play the game if
that very central dynamic bores them.  On the flip side, some of my friends
don't understand why I bother to log in if all I do is grouping and combat,
missing all the fun of tradeskilling.
