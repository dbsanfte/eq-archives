Missed that caveat.

Not too sure on rats...I've done 4 naked book runs on the first floor
to second, and although SB/LL's give you pause, you can squat on
top of a rat with no aggro.

Although it is sure that (although _rare_) some mobs are affected
by sneak/hide that see through invis (drolvargs in DL, for one).

Also, last time we killed Corrupter of Life, he was up on the second
floor near the emissary room.  I had never seen him before, so I
don't know if that was his normal spot, but he was there and almost
caused a wipe because he saw through invis when the entire room
full of other mobs didn't.
