I'm neither, on all counts. I've been playing 2 years, solo,
in groups, in mid and high level guilds. I say high, my
highest char is 62 and I have a couple of POP2 flags -
I may never see Time or the end of GoD, and I don't mind.
I'm one of these people who wants to see a lot more
stuff done at the mid-level, to flesh out the bones of
what's there when you take a good game and rip it
apart with 5 years of mudflation and too-rapid expansion.
Some more involving content there, applying the design
ethos of the high-end encounters to mid-level content,
to bury the treadmill would go down a treat, thanks.

I play EQ because nothing else competes the way I'd
want it to compete to ditch the time I've invested in the
character. If I hadn't started playing EQ till today, I might
be more interested in WoW but from what I've seen the
next game worthy of my attention and time is going to be
Vanguard. Which could all be smoke and mirrors, we
just don't know.

I'm a natural skeptic when it comes to marketing bullshit,
really I am. But I do believe that something's going on
here, in this case, I'm swayed in this case by the testimony
of more than one person who's opinion I respect. I've
also read enough on other boards to see that the flat out
"they're not going to do anything for midlevels" is ALREADY
wrong, although I conceed we'll know more when they
release the equivalent list of the one we're discussing here
but for midlevels. For me, that list has enough disclaimers
on it that I don't worry about it, but given some people's
reactions, I think it was a mistake it was that that got out
first.

Same sort of thing, to pick an example; I read the EQii.com
forum a lot, yeah? And every day you get people coming
in there who haven't taken the time to look around and
read what's known about the game, criticising Sony for
doing X when in reality, it's been known for months that
they're not doing X at all, they're doing something totally
different. Plainly ill-informed argument just annoys me,
which is why I feel the need to argue back. People just like
to bash SOE and I think they're so used to doing it, they
haven't stopped to see what's going on. But hey, time will
tell :)
