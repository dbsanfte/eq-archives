}Heheh that sounds like it would be fun, though had more than enough

}ungreyed.

Hrm, in EK there were sooo many people, it was very competitive for mobs.  
I also noticed that because there were so many people in the zone, (a) mob 
health bars didn't seem to update as fast, and (b) you frequently couldn't 
see people that were standing right next to you.  So at least twice I 
nuked something flat much to the annoyance of whoever was standing right 
next to me, just because it still looked like it had full health and I 
couldn't @#$%! see them.

Didn't drop anything those times though, so no biggie. :)

Only drops I actually saw were some rogue gloves and a caster cloak - 
Fishnet Gloves and Cloak of the Mind, I think.  Gloves had a couple points 
of dex, Cloak was +3 Int 15 mana... 5ish AC.  Not much of an upgrade on my 
Molten Cloak, so I decided to let the lowbie wizard next to me have a shot 
at it.  (ain't I a sweetie?  Sorry, I'll be less full of myself when 
I've had some sleep. :) )
