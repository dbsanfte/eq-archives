Rubbish.

You can spend all points in any camp, but the limit per camp is the amount
of points *earnt* at that specific camp.

If you have 500 in MM, 500 in Guk, 1000 in EC, you can spend 2000 in EC, but
each purchase can not be more than 1000 in cost.  You can spend 2000 in MM
or Guk too, but in this case each item would be limited to 500 max, for as
many multiples of 500 as you have points.
