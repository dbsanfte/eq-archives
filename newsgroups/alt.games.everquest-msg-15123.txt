Greetings all. I'm a druid. When I became Ally to the Coldain in Wolfform I was
dubious to Claw of Veeshan. Hopefully that gives you a better idea. When I was
warmly in wolfform to Coldain I was still Threatening to the CoV's. (I
checked).
So, get a wolfform, con a coldain and if you're an Ally you should be dubious
to the CoV's, this assumes you never took a CoV hit, which I did not. Oh, in
case you're wondering, I never took a Coldain hit either...so the results
should not be too skewed. Good Luck. 

P.S. When you are in Wolfform outside of the old world you take a 2 level
faction hit. Which explains the reasoning above. i.e. Amiable in normal form
becomes dubious in wolfform.
