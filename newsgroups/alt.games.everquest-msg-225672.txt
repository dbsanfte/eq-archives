I had bookmarked a link to a thread from Alla's on this very topic
many months ago before buying my leezard, but checking it just now
there is no reference to the colors having different meanings.

Even so, I remember the gist of the color schemes as to having special
properties:

Green - though to increase DR / PR
Black - thought to decrease aggro radius
White - increased speed (?)
Red - thought to increase stamina

Here's why I bother mentioning this. When you talk to one of the
vendors in the Gunthak lighthouse about the leezards, each color gets
a different response with a veiled reference to a property. I think
the keyword in the black drog text was "protection".

Having had one for a long time, and knowing people with the full color
spread, I have yet to see any discernable boost to any of those
properties, so it could in fact have just been a rumor.

Regardless of what color you choose, they are a great investment for a
healer - I've heard the equivalent of having FT15. Whatever, they are
great.

Also, remember to learn to type /dism very fast (unless you can click
off the droggy icon quickly) if you want to break a cast. Then duck.
Given a ten-second cast time on cheal, this usually works. I also have
a "break" hotkey with /dism in it for when I need to move quickly.
Since they have the same 0 to 60 profile as, say, Oprah, it's best to
use your own feet to get out of harms way.
