You are aware that in order to release Luclin this year, they started work
on it quite some time ago?  Like before DAoC beta.  This is not a trivial
project that just gets thrown together over the course of a few days or
weeks.  Luclin, and it's new engine, is not a response to DAoC, it is simply
a continuation of the constant improvement and expansion of EQ in order to
keep customer interest.  If there were no competition, then, there would be
little incentive to work as hard at doing these things, but I think it's
pretty silly to assume that every change you see that is an improvement is a
responce to DAoC, or any other specific game that gets released.
