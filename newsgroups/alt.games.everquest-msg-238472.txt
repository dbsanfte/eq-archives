Alright, I said to myself I wasn't going to respond to another one of your
posts because they drip with vile, but here I go again.
I suspect her husband doesn't know her as well as you think he does.  That
was one reason for my concern over what I was doing with her.  She told me
she had spoken to him about their marital problems, but that HE didn't want
to go anywhere to get help.  Everything about the two of them she foisted
upon me had to do with HIM being the bad guy in the relationship.  So, I
spoke to Mellissa's friend in the game one night, amidst idle chatter, and
she told me "Naw, Joe's a sweety", when I asked if she knew of any bad
behavior from him.  I ASSUMED (and I shouldn't have I suppose) that she was
painting her husband to be the bad guy to me so that I would feel sorry,
care, have emotions for her and throw in some cyber lovins, AND she'd have
an EQ bud to help her with stuff, too.  She informed me that when her
husband proposed marriage, her response was, "Are you sure?"  She painted
this guy as a neglectful, has-sex-only-for-himself,
jealous-of-every-guy-she-talks-to kind of husband.  When I would speak to
him in the game later, he seemed the fuggin opposite, and I started to feel
PLAYED.  I began to realize she had a pretty damned nice home life with him,
and she was making him out to me to be the neglectful, selfish type for
sympathy.  "Awwwwwww, the poor wittle wady has problems with her husband
ejaculating before she has the big O, I'll give ya the big O with my words,
you watch and see!"  I was tempted, had never tried before, she had me
feeling sorry for her a bit, so I gave her a shot, and dammit, I got
attached to her.

Snippets from her mail shortly after my introduction:
-----------
(snip) "my first (real life lover) would go down on me till I was "woot" and
even if he
"exploded" he'd keep goin, for some reason I found it very easy, and liked
it better sometimes when he wasnt so,excited so to speak, I got "there" with
ease,  hope that cleared up that question, just dont forget about meeeee is
always a good thing, which has escaped Joe for some reason.  Doesnt matter
what I say, he acts like "it" has control of his brain, and he cant wait a
sec lol for me to be into my own, he likes it fast, duhhh I on the other
hand want to be teased to death, lol   did I just say that?  lol ok I'll
stop now." (snip)
---------

Flirty/touchy-feely enough for ya, frizbee?  Did I really have to know that
her husband couldn't bring her to orgasm and that she was subtly inviting me
to try?

Her husband needed to know sooner or later.
