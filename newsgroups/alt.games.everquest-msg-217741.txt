Well, I define myself as a "casual player" in that I play a few times
a week for anywhere between 1 and 3 hours at a time, and for me LDoN
has been excellent.  When I play for less than about an hour, I solo,
because by the time you find a group, agree on a spot, go there, find
that it's camped, agree on another spot, go there, set up and buff,
etc etc etc you've burnt the better part of an hour. I had pretty much
given up on grouping due to the hassles of putting together a group.

For the "casual player" who wants to group, LDoN is a godsend.  I'm
not only grouping again, I'm enjoying it!  I used to have the TV on in
the room because it was so damn boring to play EQ.  Now I'm so busy
having fun that I'm surprised when I ding.

Yesterday my wife and I had to go to a party in 2 hours, but we took a
chance and started looking for an LDoN group.  We got grouped,
finished the quest, ported out to bbm, sold and split, all with time
left over.  I defy you to do that with a regular group.  I wouldn't
have even considered it before LDoN.

For the casual player who only has an hour or so at a shot, LDoN is
worthless, but I'm not really sure what changes could be made to EQ to
help soloers, other than perhaps more or revamped soloing zones.
