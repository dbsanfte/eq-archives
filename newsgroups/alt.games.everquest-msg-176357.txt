Heh, the funniest part is that there are fights where the MT starts
sitting to guarantee agro.  I've heard at least three different
Faydedar strats that start with the MA sitting down, and the only
folks I know of to get flagged for PoV in Kaev's guild use a sitting
MT at the start of each wave in the Trial of Execution to ensure all
the mobs go for him (they have a caster-heavy strat that I've never
heard described anywhere else).
