Perhaps it didn't qualify as "giving a fuck", but I remember over the years 
innumerable occasions of you coming here and, I guess the correct word, if 
you truly didn't give a fuck, "noting" what someone did to you in the Rathe 
Mountains while you were trying to farm hill giants.

But again, maybe to you that didn't qualify as "giving a fuck", maybe you 
just didn't have anything better to do, but I think to an average player, 
for them it probably would qualify.  Or maybe you were being the prick.  All 
sorts of possibilities I guess.
