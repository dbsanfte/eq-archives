Kalanar, my first press ever of the "Create a New Character"
button, was created on March 17, 1999 the day after E'ci
(and EQ) went live. I dinged 60 on August 31, 2001.

My bard was made July 14, 1999 (still older than almost
every "primary" character I meet) and has been 51+ since
May/June of 2001.
