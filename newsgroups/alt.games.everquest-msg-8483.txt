Unless they've changed it since I subscribed, you can still get
prices checks from eqprices for free, you just can't get the
deeper information like the discussions or secondary pages if
your search returns more than a single page of results.

But if you liked eqprices.com, you should really subscribe.
It's cheap, and the webmaster has put (and is still putting)
a hell of a lot of work and personal expense into the site.
He's not trying to get rich, just pay the ISP bills.  He
should be supported by us for all of the free, invaluable
information we've gotten from his site all this time at
his own expense.
