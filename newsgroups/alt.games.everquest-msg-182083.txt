Monks aren't *needed* thats for sure....  theres very few things that can't
be replicated in-game - namely defensive and complete heal, and monks don't
posses either of those abilities

And in certain raids/levels of the game, I'd say wizards are as critical as
warr/cleric...  Doze, Emp, AD/RD, maybe even agnarr cycle
