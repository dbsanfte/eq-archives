They do indeed seem to be much better.  I did a collection of 30 last
night and I was a bit apprehensive at first since we weren't a high-DPS
group, but the pieces started dropping like crazy near the start, on
about half the critters.  It slowed down a bit when we got deeper, but
we still finished with 25 minutes or so to spare.

A 40-50% drop rate (depending on the number needed) would seem about right,
since that would make the number of necessary kills about the same as a
slaughter mission.
