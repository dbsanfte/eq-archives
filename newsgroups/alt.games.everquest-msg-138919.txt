 Rumbleroot? Yeah, he's one of them. I also remember slowly dying to
Itraer Vius a few times watching my HP get to 0 while CRing everyone
else. This was, of course, when we were still figuring out how to defeat
his perma-rooted incarnation.

 There's a few others.. It's not a skill I'd really use a lot. It's more
like one of those nice to have when you need them kind of things.

 Well if it recycled as fast as, say, Thunderkick or Stonestance then
probably. As it is now it's a 72 minute recycle. I dont go to solb
anymore but I think with my iksar regen and a fungi I can almost keep up
with the amount of damage it does.
