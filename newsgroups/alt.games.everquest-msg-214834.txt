Right. They've agreed to let you help them get loot, but not have any. I 
can get treatment like that as a raid guest. What difference does it 
make if he's tagged or not? (Other than being off-limits for other guilds)

So then if the consequence specified in the guild policy is guild 
expulsion you have no issues with it.

All you've done is said people need to abide by the rules without 
whining especially when they are known up front. Great. I agree with 
that... that doesn't mean the rules aren't stupid, self-serving, or 
unfair, or that they shouldn't be fixed.

Just because people agree to it, doesn't make it right. I buy a piece of 
software, then the only warranty on it is the media won't be defective 
on arrival. THAT'S IT. I agree to it because I don't have a choice if I 
want to use the software, but I don't like it, and would act to change 
it if I could...

If this guy is such a good friend of yours, why rub his face in a policy 
that excludes him? You'd think, as a friend, you'd want a guild policy 
that didn't fuck him over. I know that I wouldn't want to see my friends 
getting fucked over by my guild policy, and yet stick around out of 
loyalty to me, I'd damn well change the policy or deguild myself.

They know they've 'accepted' the situation, and its their choice to put 
up with it. That doesn't make it a good or fair situation. One has a 
responsbility to ensure that it is fair, even if one isn't being 
affected oneself.

1) People deguild all the time and still hang out and even raid with 
their friends. (And when guest raiding aren't eligible for loot... so 
the status quo is maintained really... except the guy isn't tagged and 
*is fair game for another guild to actively recuit*).

2) If 'the guild' explicitly requires attendance, and states it doesn't 
want players who play less than x, then players who play less than x do 
not belong in the guild. This isn't rocket science.

This is no different than a hockey team cutting a player who misses too 
many practices and games. He can still hang out with you, maybe even 
play during a practice... but he's not on the team anymore.
