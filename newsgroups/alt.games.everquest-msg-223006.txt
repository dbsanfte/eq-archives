Yep this fixed it.

Man, I forgot how nice this change was, but after a day back in the dark 
ages I'll never forget again.  My mage uses about 18 spells regularly, 
and having a "summons" spell set and a "working" spell set, plus the 
ability to quickly swap in Eye of Zomm for Cancel Magic and so on has 
been used constantly since his creation.  I was practically crippled 
having to use the book, which is currently organized simply by giving 2 
pages per level, pets along the bottom.  Finding Everfont just because I 
was thirsty was a pain!
