I had a problem with being booted to character select and then server
select screen on trying to enter Butcherblock. After  deleting and
re-downloading the bb files, I still had the same problem.
To check if it was a zone only problem I created a couple of alt's
with no problems. on 12th and 13th.
Maybe if you try a full file check!

Test is definitely down a HELL of a lot at the mo :-(
