Most Ivy etched is easy to quest for. But I'd just go with Ry'Gorr chain.
Its plentiful and cheap. If you have a master smith friend have him make
Ornate chain for the pieces you can't find or get.

For weapons the short sword of morin quest in kithicor is Very easy to do.
Or just buy Centi short and long swords.
