| Well, I read it differently at first, but it seems pretty ambiguous from
the
| original message.
|
| I was initially under the impression that the list of recipes that it
would
| give you was recipes that you could make from the items already in your
| inventory.  So, for example, you have all the pieces necessary to make
| arrows but no bow staves and wanted to fletch, it would give you all the
| arrow combines you could make from the arrow components, but wouldn't show
| you any bow combines whatsoever.
|
| This is the line:
|
| "In the window you will find an area that has all recipes that are
currently
| available to you."
|
| Does "currently available" mean simply within the skill range they refer
to
| later, or the recipes you have all the items for in your inventory?  I
mean,
| if you don't have arrowheads, one wouldn't consider making arrows to be a
| recipe available to you.
|
| C
|

I took it to mean that you would see all recipes available to you according
to your skill level, if you had the items in your inventory then you would
be able to create them with the click of a button, but to try to make an
item that requires a skill greater than your current level you would have to
do it the old fashioned way.
