This is an interesting thread...I'd have to guess(yes guess) that a large
percentage of people(maybe 25-30%?) that play Everquest have no interest in
LOTR or D&D or anything like it, but like computer games and/or like the
social aspect of it...(it's IRC with graphics for a lot of people I
know)......But, also I would imagine there might be people that have played
Everquest then read the books(because of new found interest in the fantasy
world).....
