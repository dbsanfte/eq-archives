I guess this is part of their desire to give everyone a gentle entry point 
into the system. I don't care for it that much and view it was a very 
extended tutorial for levels 2-5. I used to do all the quests on the Isle 
with my new characters and I've come to know it pretty well, but lately I 
just do the quests that I know will get me to 5 and blow everyone a goodbye 
kiss and head for the docks.
