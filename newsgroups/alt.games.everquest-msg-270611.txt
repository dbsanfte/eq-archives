My first reaction to this is to encourage you to seek out a decent 
guild, which would probably do a lot to solve the problems of playing 
with people who's primary focus is only their own limited agenda. But I 
do not have experience with EQ II yet, so I don't know where you might 
begin the search for a good one or how. Perhaps on the server boards on 
the SOE Website for the game? I don't know yet what resources exist 
there for this kind of thing.

But really, what you described above doesn't sound a whole lot different 
that what one might experience in EQ 1, if they are not in a guild of 
friends who enjoy playing together and helping each other out.
