That I do agree with.  I just want to be sure that that is what is being
done, not just a blanket elimination of all people whom we think might
possibly somehow be such a person.  There are far too many people who are
taking out their anger on the wrong people.  There have been many incidents
here in the US already of arabs being beaten, their stores being vandalized,
being chased out of public places.  It sickens me to hear of people behaving
in this way, towards anyone.  I understand that emotions are running very
high right now.  There have also been many acts of tolerance here, and I am
happy to hear about them.
