Yes, so far as I've seen, that sort of thing has been excised completely.   If
a quest requires a specific drop, it has always been from X type of mob, with
a chance to drop off all the common mobs once you get the quest.   If a quest
requires killing a specific named mob, so far every time the named mob has
spawned on cue as soon as a flagged player moved into the named's section of
the zone.

I've yet to see a single quest which requried both a named spawn and a rare
drop off it.
