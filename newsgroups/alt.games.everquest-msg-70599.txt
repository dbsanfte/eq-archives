    You can't use /sit when mounted, so it may very well be "as intended".
Horses have a whole bunch of odd effects:

-When mounted you have a fairly high Safe Fall, but can't be Levitated.
-Horses accelerate to max speed. They don't have you always moving at top
speed if you stop to look at something.
-Horses, in some odd way, count as a pet. Zoning with a wizard's familiar up
and a horse will get you a "you already have a pet" message and will poof
the familiar - but it leaves up the familiar buff (which is HUGE plus for a
wizard).
-You meditate as if sitting when on horseback.
-You don't slow down when encumbered.
-If stunned when travelling forward, you continue forward at the same speed
(but unable to steer) until the stun wears off. Great for casters who need
to plow through a group of mobs that could stun them.

    Horses are much different that the "graphical TBoots" I thought they'd
be when first announced.
