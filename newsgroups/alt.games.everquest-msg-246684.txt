It's not even that bad.  Nvidia supports PS2.0 just fine.  Slower than the
ATI cards, but still just fine.  Due to the hardware design, ATI cards are
*theoretically* the faster cards for DX9 (only) games.  I say theoretically
because ATI has historically proven incapable of producing a decent driver
implementation to keep up with changes that happen after a card has been out
a couple months.  DX9.0a will possibly switch that, and DX9.1 will probably
switch that.
