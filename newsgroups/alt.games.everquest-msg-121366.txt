Then you are obviously not the type of player to which I am referring.
You are open and up front about what you will be paying, giving them
the opportunity to decline.

/sigh That's *not* what I'm talking about. Again, I am talking about
being able to afford an *appropriate* donation - not some ridiculous
amount.

There is a lot of that to be sure. Imagine there being no contempt or
greed from either side. Porters would port anyone in need regardless
of ability to pay, and those who could afford to would pay an
appropriate amount. If either side has a problem with following that
guideline, they are wrong.

I applaud your thrift, and try to exercise it myself as much as
possible. As long as you let the porter know before the port how much
you are willing to pay. There is nothing wrong with not valuing the
port at more than 5pp yourself. Just understand it's not the
consensus.

Uh, no it isn't. Going rate is the typical (average) rate. Not what a
particular person says.

I have *never* seen scads of people offering ports for 10pp at any
given time. I'm not saying you're exaggerating, I'm just saying that
maybe it was a case of competition at the time driving it down. I've
noticed people with no patience practically giving away stuff simply
because there were others also trying to sell the same thing at the
time (banded armor comes immediately to mind - selling for less than
cost).
