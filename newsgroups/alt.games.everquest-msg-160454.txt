Every one left out one of the big ones once you get to raiding larger prey.
/RAID  While the XP sucks.  (they could have left the 6 team group mod and
then split between 60 rather than decrease base XP then split between 60..
Not like it maters whenyou are talking about tha little xp)   You normaly
don't do the .raid for xp benifits, but for the fact that you can set up
better groups.  ie.  one group of clerics that can watch the compleat raid
from the rade concel.(click gorup 3 menber 3... heal, click group 9 menber
2...heal.  ect.)  Being able to set up a tank group that get's to talk to
just them selfs, and a cleric group and a necro group...  Since they are in
similar groups you can insure that no-one overwrites someone elses spell.

I love the /raid feature   Would love it more if ther was deasent XP.  Like
a ranted above.
