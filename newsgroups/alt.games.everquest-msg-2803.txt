Ticks me off too, but you learn to deal with it. I was on the other end of
it last night. Went to the NW corner of Feerot to camp the undead spawns
there for bone chips and xp.  When I arrived, nobody home. So after I
broke the 3 spawn and had plenty of health, I went next door and busted
heads on the five spawn.  I switched back and forth that way for several
spawns. Then suddenly, after finishing the five spawn, I limped back up to
the three spawn and found an ogre sitting there next to a dead skellie,
obvously camping it. DOH!
  But I wasnt' there watching it and keeping it empty when he showed up.
This obviously made it fair game for him, so I quietly headed back to the
five spawn and sat my butt down there to guard it.  I figured there was
plenty for both of us anyway.
