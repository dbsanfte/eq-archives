Plus, there are going to be incentives for people playing both games, like
crossover quests. No-one really knows what this entails yet, but it's
probably A Good Thing (tm).

You will surprise yourself with how quickly you pick it all up. You only
need to be hit by a "train" once to work out what it means, for example :)
But there's a good jargon guide here
http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/everquest/eqglossary.htm
you can use to look up any terms you don't know. (There's a lot more
stuff in that guide than you'll likely ever see)

With EQ Gold, UK you have access to all the servers in the server list.
With the exception of the foreign language EQ servers, which are marked
as such in the list, you also get a lot of Americans playing on the Euro
servers, and vice versa.

The number of expansions and which ones you have installed should be
underneath the server selection screen. All the expansions need to be
installed
in the same EQ directory (helpfully with addons that you buy, the default
install directory is usually different, so look out for that). Legacy of
Ykesha
is a (mainly) download-only expansion. To register an expansion, click the
register expansion button and type in the CD Key, and Bob's your mother's
brother. Don't give out that CD Key to anyone...

You soon get a feel for this, too. There are lots of EQ sites specialising
in
each of the EQ classes that are brimming with tips on this (like
eqdruids.com,
shadowknight.org etc). Most are linked off the hands-down best EQ
resource on the net, everquest.allakhazam.com

If you're a class that has the ability to track, you can track them. The
/loc
command gives your location - put it on a hotkey, and hit it when you know
you're going to die, so you know where to go back to. Some classes have
spells to locate your corpse, that turn you to face them when you cast. You
can also buy/loot a Chipped Bone Rod which has the same effect regardless
of your class (but only works 3 times). Legacy of Ykesha added a handy
map feature, which can help when youre somewhere unfamiliar.

Print off the ones on Allakhazam's.

In fact, if you're planning on going to EQ2, it's probably the best server
to be on, because it's new, and so the players there are playing the game
how it's meant to be played. You probably won't get to see the high-end
content starting now, but then again if you restart on EQ2 that's not an
issue

Unless you're a bard, bards are hard :)

A recent patch made it even easier, allowing you to load and save sets of
spell lineups, and categorises all your spells for you so you know what
they do.

Not sure about on Stromm but if you're a truly casual player, the UK/US
thing is probably going to be less of an issue for you. The important thing
is to find people that you can get on with, and have a similar play style.
My own guild (www.coalitionoftwilight.com) on Venril Sathir is not casual
as such, because we do go on raids, and are going after our epics, but
we're mainly about having fun first and foremost. Some members haven't
logged on in the last month, some of us are never off :) About a third of
them are US, the rest of us are from the UK. Anyway, I digress.
Talk to the guilds and see who you like best, group with them, make
friends.

Have fun, and welcome to EQ - you'll never leave :)
