I got about 1 to 1/2 hours to play EQ this afternoon, and I can't get to the
login server.  I just wish that Everquest would give an accurate description
of when the server are up or down, everytime I can't log in, they always
show that they are up.  I got one bubvle to go to get my Druid to 19 to get
his teleport skills, but now it won't happen today because I can't log in.
