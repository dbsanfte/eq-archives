Your radiation leak is a perfect example. It was discovered that
scorpions and roaches are able to survive lethal (to most others
including humans) levels of radiation after nuclear testing.

Natural selection does not care about what created the environment.
Whether it is the folly of man (eq nulcear accidents/war) or an ice
age. The "fittest" (life forms that can survive the conditions)
survive. Where are the dinosuars today.

"SOME" were more fit than others. "SOME" survived as others around
them fell. 

The example is extreme, but it proves Darwin's theory to the letter.
The strongest (for whatever reason) survived. Just like the strongest
survive famine, drought, or plague. In this case the "plague" was the
inhuman actions of evil and sadistic men.

It isn't chance or luck that determines which zebra the lion will take
down. The lion selects his prey from among the old, the weak, the
slow, and the young. 

Death, disease and mental illness are much like the lion. When an
individual is "selected" from the herd, they fall victim. What
seperates and elevates us above the "zebra" is the fact that we can
use out intelligence (technology, medicine, therapy) to combat the
"lion". The "lion" will still win many battles. That is just the
nature of things (eq Darwin's theory)
