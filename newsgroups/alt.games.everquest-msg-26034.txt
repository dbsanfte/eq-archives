I am a casual player, 1-2 hours a night, average about 10 hours a week.  I
like the game but I'm not addicted ("Really, I'm not," he says, trying to
stop his mouse-click finger from shaking).  All the cool stuff people talk
about seems to be in/from the expansions.  Do I need to get them?  I realize
this is a question without a real answer, I'm just expecting people to sound
off with their own opinions.
