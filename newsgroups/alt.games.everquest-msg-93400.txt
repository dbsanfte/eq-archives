Well, being the one who used the term "toon" initially in this thread, I
would offer the following:  I didn't realize posting in newsgroups was a
role-playing game and required staying "in-character".  Additionally, being
"slightly" older than the average gamer, I would say that describing my
language as pre-pubescent and D00D speak is probably a bit off kilter.  And
for anyone who has actually been playing this game the three years I have,
toon was used in the early days to describe just that--the cartoon character
you are playing in game.  And if yours doens't look like a cartoon character
on your computer screen, you obviously have the CGI version of EQ that I
haven't been privvy to yet  =) ... anyway, thanks for all the good advice to
those of you that actually answered my original question ... Bill
