I believe that if you could get it to work (haven't heard of a successful
attempt yet) then there's no way it could be bannable.  You're not using 3rd
party software, you're using the software that came with your hardware (not
talking about freebie programs like games that may come with a video card),
and no one's going to have a leg to stand on if they want to punish you for
that. :)
