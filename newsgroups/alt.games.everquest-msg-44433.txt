As I posted elsewhere in this thread, you click on it, and place it in an
open spot in your inventory, just like any other item you pick up.  Yes, I
see that you said generally, and I'd agree that's been my experience, I have
only picked up one No Drop item that I can recall, and I have no clue what
it is for, that is the Gray Colored Ice from FM.  Nonetheless, it does show
that you can "pick up" at least one nodrop item.  So, he should pick his
nits more carefully in the future.
