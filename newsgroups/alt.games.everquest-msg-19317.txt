No.  The red will give you more XP.  The XP for a mob is ZL^2, where L
is the level of the mob, and Z is the zone factor.  Z is 75 for most
outdoor zones, and a little higher for most dungeons, and even higher
for a few dungeons.  However, see below.

There is a cap on how much XP you can get from a single kill.  The cap
depends on your level.  You should still get more for Trak than the
goblin, but not a lot more.
