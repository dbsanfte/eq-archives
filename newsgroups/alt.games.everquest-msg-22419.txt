phrase (frz)
: n.
: 1.    A sequence of words intended to have meaning.
: 2.
:     a.    A characteristic way or mode of expression.
:     b.    A brief, apt, and cogent expression.
:
: 3.    A word or group of words read or spoken as a unit and separated by

:
: 4.    Grammar. Two or more words in sequence that form a syntactic unit
that

:

"Turn of the Screw"
"The Light at the end of the Tunnel"
"Behind every cloud lies a silver lining"
"Hair of the Dog"

These are phrases because they have meaning acquired through time within
Western Culture.
Just because you put two words together does not automatically make them a
phrase.

: It is not that I want "kitty" to be an adjective, it is that I have no
: choice in the matter. And, even if it wasn't, it would still be a phrase.

: Dictionary.com list these meanings for phrase. Note especially the first
: meaning. If you have some other, new meaning, that renders these void,
: please list it.
:
: "Blue dog" or "kitty cat", as  phrases, are defined by ALL these meanings,
: as far as I can see. And, they only need to be defined by ONE, to be
: considered  phrases.
