Yep any price oddities which gave players the ability to make an item
and sell it back so they were actually making money was nerfed to the
point where it is not worth your time. Any such guide like that is
basically very outdated now and there are very few ways to make money
besides just playing the game, getting stuff and selling it to
players.

The best way I've seen to make money on the new firiona vie server is
to go to the warrens now that a few people can bind finally. At level
11 I'm getting bronze that sells for 2 plat 8 gold from kobolds green
to me to npcs. I don't know about on regular servers but the molars on
this one are also not magic or lore so they always drop even if no xp
mob and the molars can be turned in a quest to a guy who may give you
ringmail for them. Ringmail is worthless on an established server but
on this one is something everyone wants at this point.
