I can honestly say that when I play my shaman in a group I am never the
puller, and I often have my pet up to help a bit with damage.  If I am
soloing my shaman, I never have my pet up, I generally root and rot, as that
seems to be the most effective way of killing mobs.  In the right places, I
can pretty much do that nonstop, with no medding in between kills, as I med
while the mob is dying.  With my other characters, pets aren't an issue.
