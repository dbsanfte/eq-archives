Well, being a mage I just kill a few very green things to get a gold or two.
Buy Malachite and I've got a fully armored, massive damage output monster
right there and then.
Then I head out to CC, say "Screw Geonid faction" and get loads of cash. I
don't have many no drop items on my mage yet, 4 focus items, Coldain shawls,
GD Tooth. Won't mind camping Najena dungeon again either :)
