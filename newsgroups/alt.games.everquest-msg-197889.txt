Which is ironic since unlike PoV/S, this is actually a pretty
difficult zone. I doubt anyone could solo there since the charm nerf
and nobody is gonna be heading past the zone-in room unless they have
a good group of lvl 60+. 

Even pulling to zone in isn't trivial, either you stick to only
roamers (who don't, I think, spawn greater pusslings) or you have to
be able to deal with unslowable mobs that hit for over 600. 

My prediction, after flags are removed you'll have 3 groups training
each other at zone in and the rest of the place will still be empty
except for the really good groups. 

Rgds, Frank
