OVERALL
My individual favorite race is probably half-elf.  Part of two worlds,
belonging in neither, misunderstood by most, picked on by some, unwelcome on
either side, and ultimately unable to fit in properly anywhere they go.  In
short, they remind me of me.  My main is a half-elf who spent his bitterly
unhappy and troubled youth (all 70 years of it) in Qeynos, nearly getting
killed several times either by bullies or as a result of his own misdeeds.
He was never very good at lying or escaping the law, and it's a lucky thing
Rodcet Nife called him away from his life of crime, or he'd probably have
been a corpse floating in the aqueducts some time ago.

GOOD OLD HOMO SAP
Well, the humans offer three distinct subraces, which I think is pretty cool
in itself.  I like barbarians the best of the humans.  I have perhaps a pint
of Scottish blood in me and, sometimes, the swirling of my circulatory
system concentrates all the Scottish blood into my brain at the same time.
I spontaneously develop a Gaelic accent, a desire to consume impressive
quantities of alcohol, and a feeling that I need to wear something drafty on
the lower half of my body.  Fortunately, this condition never lasts long
enough for me to do anything about it, and I go back to being a rude, dumb
Frenchman almost immediately.  Anyway, I like the big Northerners.

THE OTHER GOOD RACES
Dwarves.  Hands down, dwarves.  Gnomes are okay, but they're just not my cup
of tea.  Elves are likewise: the high elves are too snooty and the wood
elves just seem bland to me.  I hate halflings with a passion and would
gleefully exterminate them all, had I the means.

THE BAD GUYS
I like trolls.  More specifically, I like troll warriors.  Not for the
abilities of the class or race -- which do work well -- but for the RP
potential.  I've got a troll warrior named Mutch, whose gimmick is that he
isn't dumb.  That's right, he is able to count to ten without using his
fingers.  It's probably a cliche, but I still like it.  I just find it
amusing that a stupid, evil troll professes an easygoing nature (not a good
guy, just less bad, more a bastard than a genuine evildoer, and much less
likely to try to eat you), speaks in complete sentences, smokes a pipe, and
waxes philosophical with groupmates.  He gets odd stares from small-race
roleplayers.
