Had you read the last post, you'd know that is was not the ranting
that was indicated as the help I was giving my friends.  Brent accused
of being a jag off because I had the gall to intervene in
circumstances though not nice, and perhaps not my business, but seemed
to conform to the duty I felt as a friend to my friends. The last post
was explaining that my actions were a product their behaviour and that
the help I was giving them was independent of these usenet threads;
and in many ways, I think our (as in me and other friends) were
necessary. I thought that pretty was obvious... but then again, I also
thought trying to help friends was a good thing.... I guess I was
wrong about that too...
