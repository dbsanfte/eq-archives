Awesome. Well done. Little advice, don't like the rog lead the General
raid, think maybe you or another "veteran" should. Generel and his
cronies doesn't mess around.

I was one of two clerics on a Renux raid. We had almost two full
groups. Mostly casters. Buffed and prepped for 30 minutes, killed him
in about 45 seconds.  Seems like they pulled way out from mine area
and fear kited him. Or maybe they were jsut kiting. I know my stuns
were all resisted :)
