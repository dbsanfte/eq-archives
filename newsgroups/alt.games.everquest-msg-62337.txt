About as funny as refering to an extinct bird in reference to a possible
extinct web site. Dinosaurs are all gone to, too bad there were no
humans areound to blame 'that' extinction on eh?

I and the guy that asked the original question downloaded the maps
to 'use' them, how is that abuse? Not like we set up 20 computers
randomly hitting the site with DoS attacks.

I get a hell of a lot of use out of those maps I downloaded. I even
enjoy seeing the maps to zones I have not been to yet, but may some
day. This is one damn big game!
