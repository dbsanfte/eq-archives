You are. To me this is new. And I haven't yet seen the solutions I
think would work implemented anywhere.

Nah, it was that the pkers could hit and run with no viable way to
strike back and that the normal support infrastructure that supports
the "goodguys" versus the bandits wasn't in place or effective.

Quake has no skills it has classes. Were talking about the ability to
custom build a class to your specifications, using basic starting
templates and skills you buy with time and exp points earned. This
would allow for a much more varied game then any Quake or TFC based
derivative. Add to that a huge map. Now further add geographical
targets that add to the situation, such as Keeps, relics, supply
trains, resource hotspots, etc. Mythic has started down the road but
hasn't had the guts to go all the way.  They still are tied to EQ's
way of doing things.

No she'd be a Queen with a penis.

I'm not talking programming of course. It would take months to get
familiar with their code at the least, no I am talking give me a
server and a programmer who can selectively unpatch certain things
they have done.  I'd put the exp system back to day one for example
thus making the leveling portion of the game much less important and
long. 
I'd remove the whole roaming Guard thing that restricts RvR to one
small area near emain. 
I'd triple the relic bonuses and apply them to PvE as well. 
I'd make the Epic zones frontier but each nearest the relative realm. 
I'd make exact duplicates of current dungeons with loot that's better
and put them in the frontier with "Ownership flags" out front that
limit who can use them. Take the Ownership flag and the dungeon is
your realms. 
I'd add a Realm Score with benefits for the highest and penalties for
the lowest with a monthly reset. 
I'd add Trade Missions that would roam the Frontier keeps and that
would require protecting. 
I'd make keep Lords able to Roam within 100 yards of the keep and
remove their immunity to Arrows and magic.  
All of these things are fairly easy to do with current in game
graphics and code. 2 months tops.
