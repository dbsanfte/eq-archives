Only persons on my ignore list is a PL begger that after 6 NOs started
begging for buffs instead, and 3 guys in NFP that on the same nigth did
a LOT of spamming (talking around 20% of the text in freeport was their
spam, impossible to trade).
Apart from that, all players i have problems with i write their names
down instead, and if they someday happens to beg buff/sow, or wanna
trade, i just tell them they can forget it, because they behaved bad
earlier.
