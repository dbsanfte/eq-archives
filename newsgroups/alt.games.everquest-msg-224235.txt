Anyone know if this is currently broken?  I was under the impression
that "Shield of Pain X" on an item meant an innate damage shield of X.
I thought this was be ideal for my needs-every-bit-of-DPS-he-can-get
Froggy Paladin twink but alas it seems be broken.  Spent a chunk of
change on a mediocre shield if this is the case.

Things will be even worse for him when they get around to fixing all
the issues with high level weapons/procs so I hope they fix the items
with Shield of Pain on them too.
