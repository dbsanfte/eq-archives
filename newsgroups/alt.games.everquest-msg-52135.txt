Ok...we'd been over reasons and debated why we liked/disliked/
were ambivalent about servers numbers no longer being given out.
That's fine, but I found a new reason today.

Today is patch day.  I knew it was a scheduled patch day, and
of course I have the day off of work on patch day ;-).  Scheduled
downtime is 6 hours.  I can live with that.

So I go to check email and bring up Evermon to let me know when
servers are up.  Servers are up. Oh, joy!

Can't log in.

Check out the official webpage for server status.  Servers are up.
Oh, joy!

Can't log in.

Now I'm not insane.  I know that it's still not time for the patch to
be over according to schedule.  I know the old joke used to be
"Verant says patch scheduled for 4 hours, make it 8 plus 2 for
the emergency patch."  But VI's had their stuff together about
patches for a long time now.  Often as not they bring it up a little
early, even.  Which is why I wasn't surprised to see servers up
a couple of hours early.

Can't log in.

This is where I miss my numbers.  If I could bring up the VI
server-status page and see that there are currently 400 people on
my server, I'd just know that the Login server is actually congested
and try  back later.  If the servers read up but only 2 people in
there, I'd think maybe they  were GM's or something trying  things
out.

But it just says "UP."  And, for me anyways, it's not.  Again, having
access to that simple number-on-line-on-my-server would let me
know what's going on.

I miss my server numbers today.
