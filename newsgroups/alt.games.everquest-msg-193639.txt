So much for the Pre-PoP BS about Levels past 60 seeming to flow better
than 50s. Yeah right in uber_guild_01 where you are flagged for tier 3
bet it is great. Still maintain the 50s grind was the worst thing SoE
ever pulled and now think 61-65 comes in second. Its a grind if you
cant get flagged. Which btw is my choice for number 3 design foulup,
flagging is perhaps the worst thing Ive ever seen for keeping content
closed. Content that was supposed to be easier to get to remember?
Well now we know it was done that way so they could control when
anyone entered new zones. The higher tiers just were not ready for
prime time. Flagging is easier maybe if you are a level 60+ Cleric,
Warrior, Rouge,  Mag, Shammy not if you are Necro, Druid, Bard, etc.
DPS and hitpoints are king in flag trials cant believe they didnt see
that in design. If they wanted to test player skill then each class
would have its own trials, done solo, naked, with buffs stripped. Heh
now that would of been great. Bet Furor woulda had a heart attack
seeing that one.

Now look at me ranting again../em sighs. Betcha cant tell this is my
first and last SoE game huh ? lol
