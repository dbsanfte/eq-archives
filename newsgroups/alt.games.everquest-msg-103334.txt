I quoted the manual on EQ's website about the ooc channel deep in this
thread so lemme just post it again (spam! spam!  I'm a bastard!).

"Out of Character. Speak out of the context of the game and your character.
Use this if you're having a problem or have a question that doesn't pertain
directly to the game. These messages display as bright green text to anyone
within your playing zone. Again, don't overuse this."

Although you can argue that the manual isn't the rule book, I think it shows
Verant's intent when they created it.
