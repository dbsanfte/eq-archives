I think you are the first and probably only person to think that.

The really funny bit is where you suggest that the levels or AAs or gear 
are 'required'.

With 96% rezzes you can afford to wipe pretty often and still earn those 
AA's and levels quickly enough. Not as fast as possible you mind you... 
but SFW. There's a ton of midlevel content... I'm of no mind to skip it. 
The high end game isn't going anywhere.

I've met some pretty bad players in EQ... but any one of them would make 
a better ai then the actual ai.
