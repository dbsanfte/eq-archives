Look at your silver and copper pieces.  If either is over 100 then you need 
to report to the bank and convert them to the next higher denomination.  Now 
you are not burdened anymore!  (Hopefully).

This happened to me and I was going crazy throwing away all the harvest 
items and still could not move but to inch along.  Then someone told me. 
Funny how a bag of iron ore is weightless and a pocket of pennies weighs a 
ton lol.
