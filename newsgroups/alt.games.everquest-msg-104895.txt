There are some decent range slot items, but you won't likely
find/afford any until you are well into your 30s/40s.
I mean is there a range weapon

Your weapon skills cap lowere as a shaman. Look up the caps at
eq.castersrealm.com

You are NOT a druid. You can tank MUCH better. Root/DoT until the mob
is worn down, then slow (your bread and butter) and finish it off with
Melee.

SoL has only been out for 5 months. Also the hardware requirements to
play on the moon are steep. Very few people are playing Vah Shir in
their home town and newbie zones. Try looking up Quests by zone at
www.everlore.com . Also check out the following sites...
www.interealms.com (link to Shaman site and message board)
www.eqbeastlord.com (lots of Kitty quests and info, since most people
are playing Kitty BLs)

In EQ you quest for the challenge and the fun. If items are what you
are after, hunt got PP and buy what you want. It is more efficient.

Every copper counts. Loot everything you kill and sell the crap to
vendors. Collect pelts and bone chips and sell to players. As a Shaman
you can park in places like Oasis and SoW/Buff for donations. You are
playing one of the few classes that has something other players are
willing to pay for.

>If you have the plat to skill level, you're golden, if you don't, well too bad. T

Levels = PP

Pure and simple. Where do you think high level players got their cash?
At some point they levelled one of their toons to 30+ and started to
loot more PP and better items to sell. Over time they accumulated the
items/wealth they currently have. That is how the game works. There
are no short-cuts (other than ebay).
