My dark elf necro is lvl 25
 Never been LoIO, tried for the first time with dark elf cleric lvl23.
On our way from Firiona Vie portal to LoIO, we got attacked by yellow mob
which we killed then by the guards. We learned we are KOS there and my
cleric buddy got killed by the guard.

Is it too early for us to go there or just one bad luck on the first time
travel?

Where is the good hunting place for 25-26 Dark elf necro to go hunt?
Any suggestion?
