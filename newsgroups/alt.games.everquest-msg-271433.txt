Hm, you did not get my point. I don't argue for a better mana pool with
mezzing one mob. Heck even a necro could mezz that when they weren't
driven out of mezz business by the levelcap.

I talk about 5+ mobs in camp. The last time I had that I helped a rogue
with the epic fight in Freeport. (1.5 Epic) We were just short of 2
groups and not even VT equipped. Though the mobs might be mezzable with
the 61 mezz they definitely weren't mezzable with GoK (54).
Sure these aren't your day to day fights but you wouldn't argue that the
usual single pull exp group is a real test for any char, would you? :D

Though I find this list quite appropriate. :)


Hagen

P.S.: Your mana calculation is somewhat wierd. A lvl60 Enchanter regens
25/Tick due to meditate skill. Given KEI with 14/Tick leaves me with
21/Tick short of your calculated 60/Tick. So without BST&DRU buffs he
better has one hell of a lot FT gear. ;)
Or do I miss something?

And an enchanter on a horse....brr. Never ever would I try that when you
have a critical situation. But that's just me. :)
