Another thing that may help is to turn /showspelleffects off.  It does just
what it says, and will
reduce the work your card has to do when around a bunch of spell casters. I
tried it, it worked,
but I got so used to seeing the spell effects (plus I am an enchanter, so it
helps a LOT to know
which mob just got blasted/mezzed/whatever) that I turned it back on and am
putting up with the
"graphics-lag" till I bought my geforce ][ mx 64.  Then I realized that I
still have the lag, just that
it LOOKS much better. hehe

Duron 750   256m memory  56k connection Hercules Prophet ][ mx64
and I STILL have EQ in-game lag??? On a game that is supposed to
play well on a 300 pentium ][? Thats the computer I had before, and built
a new one, now in ill omen I have Graphics lag like I used to in Blackburrow
on the 300.  Hmmm. will I have to buy a mainframe to run Lucian when it gets
here????   ;-)
