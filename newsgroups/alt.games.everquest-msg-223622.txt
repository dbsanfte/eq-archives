I'm on the Mac server and we've attempted to hit POI on a couple of
occasions without success. Attempted again last night with a 51
shaman, 60 wizard, 55 pally, 56 warrior, 60 bard, and 56 cleric. I was
the main puller (pally). I had a hard time getting anything less than
three on a pull. We even let the 60 bard give the pulling a shot and
had similar results. The wizards 58 root spell lasted all of one
second when they got it off. How does one go about about breaking the
initial mobs so one can start getting them in singles as they repop?
We're not looking to start working the ring just yet, as our gear is
not up to par. We're wearing Thurgadin armor and cultural armor. Any
assistance would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance.
