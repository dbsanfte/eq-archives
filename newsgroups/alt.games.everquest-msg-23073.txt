Just FYI, Ninja looting has nothing to do with speed.   In common usage, it's
any time a person loots where they don't have the right to do so, as
determined by the group/raid who made the kill.   It doesn't matter whether it
is before anyone knows about the drop (speed) or whether the person didn't win
the roll, or even if the person wasn't a part of the group and walked up and
clicked while they were rolling.   All are examples of this behavior.
