How about some new spell ideas for this catagory?

See Visible - Allow the caster to see objects, creatures, and players
that are already visible.

Ordinary Vision - Similar to Serpent Sight and Ultravision except
lower level. It grants the caster ordinary vision.

Summon Self - Summons yourself to your present location

That's all for now...
