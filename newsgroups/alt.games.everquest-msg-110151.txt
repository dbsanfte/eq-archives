I hope so, boats suck ass and slow down travel and have no place in an
mmorpg in the year 2002.

Yeah, this was fine in 1999 when verant told us every damn day that
the game would lack challenge or fun if we did not have to wait 20
minutes for a boat then take 15 more minutes to ride it to butcher,
during which time we could feed our fat asses or take a heaping ass
dump into the toilet (this is a rough paraphrase of pretty much
exactly what that JACKASS abashi said on verants old whineplay forums)

Sorry, but sitting around on your ass watching your toon do jack crap
is not my idea of a video game but rather crap that I'd hate to do in
real life such as waiting for the bus or crap. Crappity crap crap,
then some crap on the side.

Yeah, they add angst, impatience and loathing.

Jack crap, boats just plain suck ass since they involve a waiting
element that sucks in a GAME. The only thing that can be done is to
GREATLY speed them up so you have practically no wait. However, what
would be the point? If you speed the boats up to the point where they
are nearly as fast as a TP, such as the luclin spires would be, then
what is the point of having the boat instead of such an auto tp? The
boat becomes superfluous.

Verant shot down gambling on the boards eons ago, they said since Plat
is sold for real life money that gambling in EQ in a way would be
gambling for real life money. You can kind of see that they are right
if you think about it.

If some of the things you suggest had been done originally, especially
renting a boat yourself that you can zone on, then it would be fine.
The problem is that by this time 3 year bitter ass old veterans of the
game (such as myself) are just sick and tired of the crappy ass boat
system from hell. 

The nexus auto tp transporation system is one of the best god damn
things they've done in EQ in 3 years, for the good of the game. Its
just damn freaking ass fantastic. My non porting charcters love the
unholy festering dung heap out of it. Nk to nexus to Gfay, boom. Gfay
to nexus to toxula, boom. You can't travel anywhere near that fast the
old way, sometimes its even faster than getting a port even if someone
is offering. Even my druid loves taking it to ride to the nexus. Get
the stone, sit down, go to the potty and get back and I'm in nexus.
This is one of the best parts:

The old way, unlike what Abashi was saying, if you go to make a
sandwich or take a festering dump in the poo depository,  you will
either possibly miss getting on the boat or possibly miss getting OFF
the boat. Both suck ass when the boat trips are so damn long. With the
nexus its not a concern. 

Mmorpgs are NEVER going to have travel like the EQ boat system again
and they are NEVER going to have such harsh penalties and corpse
recoveries. BOTH SWG and EQ2 have already said no corpse recovery
downtime. Worlds of warcraft has said no corpse recovery, AO has no
corpse recovery, it is passe'. All of the old crap we put up with is
going out the window because, frankly, it takes NO SKILL to wait for a
boat or to go running for 3 hours to loot your corpse. Its a non
prowess involving part of the game A monkey could do it but it just
sucks to do (maybe  monkey would have fun while doing it, to me it
just sucks)

Downtime is gone, RIP downtime cause I hate its stinking guts.
