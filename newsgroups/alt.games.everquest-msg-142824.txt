I used to have a simple program that would do that as well, but I can't remember 
what it was. It was really easy to use and handled large files fine. I just 
tested out a program called TXTcollector but it's taking too long just for a 15MB 
file, so it wouldn't be a good solution to your woes. What's up with computers? 
We can run a massively multiplayer game like EverQuest, yet we can't handle some 
stupid text files?
