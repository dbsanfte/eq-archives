Well, Faydedar still exists, in theory.  I spent quite a long time bound 
near the pots and never, ever saw her though.  The real danger was trying 
to swim all the way down there while /afk, aiming poorly, and coming back 
to find you'd managed to run smack dab into the raptor isles.

There's also some mid-teens level sea snakes in the general area.
