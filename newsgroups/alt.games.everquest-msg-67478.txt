Yeah, I'm sure that if Scandinavian Amiga demo coders had written SoL,
it would run on a ZX-81 connected to the Net by carrier pigeon, while
churning SETI@home units in its spare cycles.

The reason that SoL has such outrageous memory requirements is the
amount of content that has to be loaded in memory at any given time.
Just think of East Commons and all the variety of armor and weapons (and
soon pets, elementals, horses and familiars) that can conceivably become
visible at any given time.

I'm not saying the EQ engine is the most efficient in the world, I'm
just saying that even if it were, we would probably not notice the
difference.
