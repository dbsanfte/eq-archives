Warriors do have the best Taunt in the game. That's why they're the best
tanks. Archery means they can pull single mobs at a good distance and
Duel Weild and Double Attack means they can deal out some good damage
whilst taking hits. As with all melee classes maxing out Bind Wounds
ASAP is good idea. 

Cheers Watchman :)
