Ok, lets ask a few questions from the Enchanters point of view...Did you
assist one another (not at the same time, of course) only beat on one mob at
a time? Did you arrange who would take the bulldog role? In this case it
really needed to be the SK. Did that person ask the either enchanter what
they would do when aggro'd?

If you are both beating one Mob then finding the non engaged ones doesn't
take much doing, no excuses...If you both had a target each that makes
things harder. Mez is pretty expensive (mana wise) as a spell to keep
recasting and draws lots of aggro, if mez's were being broken and you didn't
try and sort out why and what to do about it then I can see their lack of
desire to mez...It's odd (but not impossible) that you had 2 enchanters that
either couldn't play their class or weren't confident enough to lay down
some rules. I guess the next question would be, did they make any strategies
between themselves on who would do what?
