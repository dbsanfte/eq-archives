and the gnome just walks under it.

Anywhoo, I dinged level 40 the other day (yay for me, 3+ years, first char
over 40 :)  I can still hunt in The OT and get experience there, but is
there a place I shoud go to get better experience?  I suppose I can go to
The Dreadlands, but that is just The OT + a few levels, heh.  Crystal
Caverns seem pretty cool, but I dont know if people still go there.  I
suppose they do.  Suggestions?

Ok now I was thinking about trying to obtain some Ice Forge Shackles
(http://makeashorterlink.com/?A26241D15) obtained by the "Grammer Manual"
(http://makeashorterlink.com/?R2E213D15) quest. I currently have
Crustacean Shell Bracers (http://makeashorterlink.com/?X6D355D15)
Would you consider this a worthwhile upgrade?  Or should I just forget
about it.

This also leads me to the last question.  Does anyone know the Stamina to
HP formula for a Warrior?  When does obtaining +Stamina Items benefit you
more than getting +HP items?  Any help on this would be great.

thanks in advance
