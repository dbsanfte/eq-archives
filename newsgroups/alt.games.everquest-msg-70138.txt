Not at all - they have every right to make valid complaints about the
game. It's the stupid absolute statements like "is unplayable now" and
"it's playability is non-existent" that are attracting response.

You're right, they're not. But the ones getting replied to in this
newsgroup, by and large, are not presenting themselves as even being
interested in a fix, but rather in demonstrating just how loudly they
can piss and moan. People who make constructive statements are met
with constructive answers. Whiners are met with contempt.
