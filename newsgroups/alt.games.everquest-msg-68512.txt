I beg to disagree... In UT, the development time went into gee-whiz
features like all the new play modes and such. In Q3, the developers
agonize over changing a percentage point in air acceleration, or a tenth
of a second on the railgun's reload time. UT is certainly nice enough,
don't get me wrong, but it's never been the choice of the hardcore. Q3
is, and simply because they got it mostly right the first time around,
and it has been honed to perfection since. I guess UT is the Asheron's
Call of first-person shooters... Nice to look at, with some very good
ideas but, on the whole, an also-ran.
