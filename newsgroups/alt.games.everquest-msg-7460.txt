To be honest, I don't recall except that it was in the Keyboard filter of the
Options menu. *I think* it is the item called Move Forward. Like all the other
keyboard items, it has two slots: the first one gives the key that activates the
function (by default, it is set to the up arrow key) and the second slot gives
an instruction on something else to do when the key is pressed. I simply set the
second slot to activate button 4 on the currently selected bank of hotkeys, then
stuck 'Forage' on button 4 in every hotkey bank (and 'Sense Heading' for my
non-foraging characters.) The change is GLOBAL, meaning that every character
will have to be set up in exactly the same way. I'd have to look at my system to
give you any more information, but this should be a start for you.
