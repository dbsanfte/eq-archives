I've noticed with a couple of my characters that they can do up to twice the
damage stat + 1 with 1hs and 1hb weapons with damage stats of 6 to 8.  I
finally got a cool axe that has a damage stat of 16, gave it to my low level
dwarf paladin and he never does more than 21 damage.

What affects the actual damage output during combat?  Does it improve as you
level?  I notice other players dealing out massive amounts of damage.  So
what gives?

Thanks
