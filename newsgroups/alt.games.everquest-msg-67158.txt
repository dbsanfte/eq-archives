I would have made an offer to refund once, then, if he was still an ass, put
him on ignore.  You and he never discussed price, he never checked what he
was buying.  His fault for assuming he would be getting 10-shots and that
the price was 100pp fer bottle.  Your mistake for not giving him a price up
front.
