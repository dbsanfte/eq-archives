It has nothing to do with being arrogant.  Druids get bugged to death for
Heals, Sows, Ports, Regens, AC buffs, Wolf form, Strength Buffs, Camo,
Levitate, PLs, Tracking, etc.  When I
first got sow at level 14, I wanted to buff everyone.  Now, I'm so sick of
people begging for buffs, I
sometimes wish I didn't have any.  It's nice when I play my alt, because I
don't get bugged to death.

The proper way to ask for sow is:  /auction WTB Sow for a CR.  Most druids,
especially the ones at the tunnel, would do it for free, because you don't
come across as a beggar.  Remember, beggars ask nice too, so that's not
going to get you anywhere.  Matter of fact beggars ask too nice...Could I
please, please, please get a sow?  (AAAAHHHHHH  I can't take it
anymore!!!!!!)

In closing...How can you call druids arrogant when most of the people who
are begging for sows (and everything else) think that it's owed to them?  I
think it's arrogant for a person to beg for something.  I have 8 characters.
My druid is 46, and I have 4 characters in the 20s, and the rest in the
teens.  I have never, ever asked for sow once on any of my characters.  Not
a one!  How come all this begging is going on in the first place?
Hmmmm......I don't think the real problem lies with the druids....
