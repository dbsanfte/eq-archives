What Goondi fails to point out (and HOPES that no one will notice) is
that the posts from the EQSTUFF Server that are in the name of my
daughter, are posts relavent to current disscussions. Which supports
the fact that those were just mistakes, left over from my CANCELs...

However, the posts that are supposedly from my daughter that are
perverted and disgusting attacks, all come from GOONDI's server...

hmmmmmmmmm   Strange that, eh??
