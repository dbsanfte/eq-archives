Definitely like the new models better. True, the females are pretty
much exploited visually in most cases, but, think about it, who REALLY
has a problem with that?

The ogres are more ogre-like (they are not just big mounds of fat) the
trolls are scarier (the old ones were just plain cartoonish) and all
the armor/equipment is WAY better.

I just REALLY didn't care for the "pasted on picture of a face" look
of the older models as well as the general blockiness of the lower
polygon count for the bodies.
