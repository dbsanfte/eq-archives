The original poster was wondering why people don't want necromancers in
their groups.  The poster had observed this rejection of sorts in the game
enough to make their own generalization about it.  See the title of this
thread.  I gave an explanation why I thought it was the case.  This based on
my own experiences and discussions with others.

Now, was my remarks stereotyping?  Yes.  Most definitely.  Welcome to the
real world.  Now we could all hold hands and sing "Kumbaya my Lord" around
the campfire, but that's not reality.  We all use stereotypes everyday and
use them to shorten how much time we invest into decisions.  Some
stereotypes are completely fiction while others are generalizations of
actual observed behavior by yourself and/or others you talk to ... and some
stereotypes are even a bit of both.  EQ is not some special place where this
doesn't happen.  Case in point: why necromancers are probably the least
wanted class in the game WHEN it comes to group invites.

And the poster was asking why this is the case and I gave what I think is a
possible explanation.  Something I've chew over from time to time and even
had a few discussions about in groups.  Sometimes with necromancers
participating and sometime not.  It was also meant to help those that are
currently playing or thinking of playing a necromancer to know what they're
up against and a possible why it is this way.

And just as whenever you face negative stereotyping, it is really up to you
to prove it wrong.  That's not right but that's reality.  When someone does
give you the chance, there's your opportunity.  If you do a good job, people
make an exception for you and get others to give you another opportunity.
I've seen this tons of times.

Leader: "Shall I invite that necro?"
Group member #4: "No."
Group member #2: "No."
Group member #6: "Nah."
Group member #3: "Yeah, invite him.  He's good.  He knows how to work in a
group."
Leader: "Well we need one more and no one else is in the zone.  Sending
invite."

Now if enough necros proved themselves to be good team members, they would
change the stereotype.  That's about the only way stereotypes change.
Unfortunately, most necromancers prove the stereotype (thus how it became a
stereotype) and thus reinforce it.

On the bright side, it has been my experience ... WARNING: another
generalization about to be launched! ... that the higher you rise in EQ, the
more it becomes a game about who you know and who knows you.  This happens
because you build up a history with other players over time.  So if you're a
necromancer that wants to preferred over others when a group is choosing who
to invite and you're good at operating in a group, your chances of an invite
will only improve the longer you play the game.
