Hello newbie. Welcome to everquest. Thank you for bringing up yet
another class whine thread they have been slowing down lately.
Its obvious you are a newbie or a troll. If you had played every class
you would know as I and every other long time player has known that
all the classes have their weaknesses and strengths.

>No bind,

Soul binders in most all towns and a few others Like FV and OT.
They are free just walk up and hail them. Even someone with
your limited intellect should be able to figure it out.

> no
> gate,

Several gate potions available in game. Play a caster.

> no heal,

Bandages, buy them, use them. Regen items in the game as well as AA skills to
increase regen. Also, group with a healer. Play a healer.

Funny thing is warriors can't heal and clerics can't dual wield swords, go figure.

> no sow,

Get Sow potions. Group with a sow caster. Play a sow caster.

> no pet.

LOL now you are just being stupid. Play a pet class.

> Luclin comes out and everyone gets new
> spells...what does the warrior get?

You mean asside from some more uber weapons and armor?

> Nothing!

They got new skills and lots of new loot to choose from like everyone
else. They are warriors not spell casters, buy a clue.

> So those of you-mostly druids-that
> complain about-oh, I can't port to Luclin,

Not being able to port to luclin hurts everyone not just druids.
Druids want group ports to the moon so they can get everyone
where they need to be to hunt and raid.

>oh, my new spell isnt that
> good,...boo friggin whoo.

Oh warriors don't get anything! Verant hates us! Boo friggin' hoo.

Well then why don't you play some other class then? If the grass is
so much greener over there newbie. Then you will come
and whine about the shortcomings of that class, etc. etc.
