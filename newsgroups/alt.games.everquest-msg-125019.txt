You may not like my response, but I live on an FCFS server, and as a result
you have to adopt your game to that, or you will never get anywhere.

Lets say I zone into SF and see Rage up, or zone into Kael and see Tormax
up, the first thing I will do is
/ (see if theres even a raid force in there), followed by
/ unity
/ keepers
/ nameless

Basically checking the numbers of each guild in the zone (I have a pretty
good idea how many people in each guild it takes to kill velious/oldworld
mobs)

If they don't have a raid force there (or very near to it) then I will /gui
Tormax is up...

So if I see 15 members of a guild in kael (refering to guilds who can kill
tormy), I know thats not a raid force and we can beat them to it.

If I saw 20+ people there though (the average is about 30-35 people for
those guilds above) Id usually assume its a lost cause.. with 1 exception.

If we had just finished a raid, and have 35-50 people all together (which
means we already have the key classes on, and everybody is near a porter)
and nothing else is up, then we will race them.

What we won't do though, is hang around in the zone if we lose the race.  We
won't train or any of that bullshit to win the race.. we simply race to get
a raid force there, and the winner gets the mob.

It's very rare that Im checking and calling mobs anyway, the fact I can't
port/gate means I hang around at the raid waiting for our next target to be
called.

Btw this isn't just how my guild operates - this is the life of Prexus..
each server has different rules etc.

If they have a raid force, then I wouldn't even bother telling my guild to
try and race there.  I may say /guild Mob_01 is up.. but Guildxx is on it -
but thats purely for the benefit of people that take note of pop times, and
like to plan/predict stuff.

If you are racing another guild, then there isn't really much/any
conversation.. you can see guild numbers in a zone anyway, anon or not (on
Prexus theres a few guilds who all turn /roleplay on before any raids.. us
and the other top guilds don't bother though)

Thats how it always is on Prexus.  Some people tried to find a better method
(e..g rotation) but you can see from my original post questions, why
something like this just doesn't work.

It's the reason my cleric doesn't have his epic (nor will he in the
forseeable future) - nor does my girlfs cleric (again level 60).. dealing
with the headache and shitfest concering Rage - no thanks!
