Actually, it doesn't.  Depending on lag/luck/the positions of the stars, 
it's quite possible to attack once before you turn it off that way.  And 
it only takes -one- swing to break a mezz.  You'd be -far- better off 
using /assist off to just make sure you never have to worry about it.

From my point of view, it'd be worth it even if it only saves me one 
moment of embarassment a year.
