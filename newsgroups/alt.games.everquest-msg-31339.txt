you know, reading this shifted my view on this issue, not really sure why
up to now, i kinda been leaning pro TLC, but now, i think this could have
been handled much easier with a line in the PNP and still let higher players
do the quests later in life

and FYI i didn't snip any of this cuz i am still looking at it to see why my
view shifted   :P
