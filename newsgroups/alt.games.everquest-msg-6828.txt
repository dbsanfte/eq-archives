I recall a news item on EQVault late last week... apparently, word
from VI was that a whole load of new tailoring recipes was supposed to
go in this patch. Didn't see anything in the message about it, but
that doesn't mean they didn't go in. Supposedly, ALL of the chanter
mana spells are supposed to be used in various tailoring recipes now
(Finally).
