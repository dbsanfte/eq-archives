There are different species of trolls.  In this case I was referring not
to the "first post to a newsgroup" type, but more the type that likes to
start bar brawls.  You should know that posting ANY "____ class is
overpowered!" rant is going to start the equivalent of an a.g.e bar brawl.

I dunno though...does that classify as a troll?  o.O  I'm often
wrong.  There might be a more apt word for it, but honestly...an
enchanter....illusion:troll...I couldn't pass up the cheap joke.

Tempting...very tempting.  I'll think about it and get back to you. ;)
