Another thing to consider would be Fishing. Bait costs about 3cp/bait. 1
fish will sell for about 2sp5cp. Takes some time, but you can fish just
about anywhere. There are numerous sites that talk about the ins and outs of
Fishing. One you can look at is www.eqguide.com/articles/fishing.htm.

Hope that helps.

I would like to start a thread on what good ways are for lower levels (up to
15 or so) to get some cash. I will try to compose the responses and put them
on a website somewhere. If you put some suggestions also note at what
levelrange it is optimum and good zones to do/find it in.

Some examples:

Silk Swatches
lvl 10-15.
Just outside antonica newbie zones (EC, WC, WK).
Buy a small sewing kit. Hunt large and giant spiders and convert the Spider
Silks to Silk Swatches (stackable). The converts will always succeed. Mind
that you use SpideR silks, not SpiderLING silks.
Depending on the server they will go for 1-2pp a piece and stacks are often
sold per 25-30pp and on rich servers up to 45pp. This because mid to higher
level tailoring needs these silks for many items.

Bone Chips
lvl 1-5.
Most newbie areas (NQ, EC, GF, ButB, NF).
Hunt the decaying skeletons and collect their Bone Chips (stackable). Necro
characters need these chips to summon their pets, so sell them to players.
Usually 2pp per stack. Might get lucky and get up to 4pp

Greater Light Stones
lvl 10-15
The wisps who drop them can be found in a lot of zones. Erud's Crossing and
WC are known to have many around.
You need a magic weapon for this. Hunt will-o-wisp's. They drop lightstones
of 3 varieties: Burned-out (worthless, can't be sold), normal (worth around
8gp to 1pp) and, the main price, the Greater Lightstones.
There are rumours that the greater lightstones are destroyed if damage
spells are cast on the will-o, but this I don't know for sure.
The greater only sell for 2 to 3pp at stores, but can often be sold to other
players for 7-8pp. This is because of a quest in NK which will yield exp and
an item worth 9pp.


I'm sure you guys can come up with a lot more. But please only feasable for
"normal" characters. Not a cha-maxed lvl 1 HIE enchanter and Baking.
Although the skill might be profitable even for normal players so I might
include it anyway :) Another good one would be the Gnoll Fangs from BB but I
don't know the specifics for that quest right now.
