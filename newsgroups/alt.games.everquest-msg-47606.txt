This is exactly where I meant. The tunnel isn't particularly twisty 
turny, but when it's pitch black, it's very easy to spend a good 10 
minutes repeatedly walking into walls, zoning back and forth etc. 
because you're totally disoriented. It's not much better even with full 
gamma and that feeble candle they give you.

This is just an example of bad design. There is no reason that tunnel 
should be so dark. It's only purpose is to frustrate and confuse newbies 
who just want to get the newbie hunting area.
