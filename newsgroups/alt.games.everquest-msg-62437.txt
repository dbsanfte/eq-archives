I am running a Radeon 32DDR board with the 7199 drivers. 

EQ seems to work ok with the DX8 driver (Downloaded from test server
patcher,..Changed the *DX8.DLL line in EQCLIENT.INI) So far the only
problem I have seen is that there is no "Fog". I can see out until the
edge of the clipping plain, and at that point new objects "pop" into
view as I move towards them.

What are the rest of your system specs?
What version of DirectX do you have loaded?
What OS are you using?
