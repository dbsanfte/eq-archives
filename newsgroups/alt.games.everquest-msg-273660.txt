I went over to my son's house today and saw the set up he's got there with 
his roommates. They have a LAN with about a dozen computers in the game 
room, all state-of-the-art boxes with some intense coordinated multiplay 
going on in that house. Lot of UT and CS. Lately, they've all started 
playing WoW, but I noticed that when they play they are all playing 
separately, soloing in different areas. With classes limited to certain 
racial types, they all started in separate areas and just kind of stayed in 
their groove separately. Seems odd to me to see that much soloing in an MMOG 
(and on a LAN no less) but the appeal of soloing is strong these days and 
the market has spoken pretty loudly on the point so I expect it's going to 
become more common. Maybe a new category needs to be coined here, MSOG?
