You make it sound like either happen a lot.  Maybe they just don't like your
sunny disposition? :)  I mean, I've been trained plenty of times...but then
again, I've TRAINED plenty of times.   If you don't enjoy getting hit with
trains, get off the tracks.  I can't even think of twice when I was trained
on purpose, and I have never trained anyone else on purpose.
