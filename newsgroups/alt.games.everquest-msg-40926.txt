Except that /stopsong and /castX are both commands, can't be on the
same line.  And you need to pause after /stopsong a bit before you
/castX.  Here is how I do a three-song twist, I create two hotkeys,
one with just the one command:

/stopsong

and the second with the following

/pause 27, /cast1
/pause 4, /stopsong
/pause27, /cast2
/pause4, /stopsong
/cast3

With no song up, you hit the second hotkey and the following happens:
start song 1, wait 2.7 seconds
stop song, wait .4 seconds
start song 2, wait 2.7 seconds
stop song, wait .4 seconds
start song 3

Now if you want to repeat, hit your first hotkey and then the second,
wait about 9 seconds and do it again.  Continue knowing that you're
now able to play three times as long before carpal tunnel syndrome
turns you into a crippled freak.

A two-song twist, which is almost always a down-time reducer
(mana/regen, mana/mana), is easier:

/pause 4, /stopsong
/pause 27, /sing 1
/pause 4, /stopsong
/sing 2

I always leave the last line as simple as possible so that I don't
have to wait for a timeout to restart the cycle if the third song
fails due to missed note or whatever.  I also leave my best/most
desirable song in the last slot so that if I go AFK or just get tired
of constantly pressing buttons, it will stay up and active.
