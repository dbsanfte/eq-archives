I know that I have read a few threads on this topic before and most people
feel that Surfall Glade is an appropriate site. I would like to know where
else to look that might be nice, for our guild just held a wedding in SF and
I would like to find some place a little different. I have not posted much,
but the information I have learned from this group has be invaluable. Thanks
for your input.
