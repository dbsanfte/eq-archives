Sounds like Hollowshade (was it? Just outside Shar Vhal, opposite side
from Shadeweaver's) on Luclin. It was 3 way: Owlbears, Sonic Wolves,
and Grimalkins (Think that's what they were called. The little
humanoid guys. Looked like dirty midgets. >< ). By killing the leader
of whatever group was in charge, one of the others would take over, if
memory serves. The group that had dominence would be the primary group
to spawn until their leader was taken out.
