I've been casting familiars since I got them.  Never had a problem or
noticed anything odd till today.  I was in Echo Caverns.  When I first
logged on my familiar poofed.  Casted a new one and it poofed as soon
as it formed and took 2 full bubs of life from me with it.  Not really
thinking fast I cast another.  Same story... poof on creation.  This
time 3 bubs of life vanish and I'm left standing with 20 hp between me
and death.  Now at level 51 I've got a bit over 1000 hp.  To see them
vanish like that is just plain terrifying.  Lucky I was in a safe spot
with nothing attacking.

The only thing different was that I was near a wall when casting
these.  All others have been out in the open.  I've never had one poof
before so soon and 2 in a row seems odd.  I've seen notes on familiars
dying and taking hp from the caster but I wasn't in any fight.

If anyone has any light to shed on this I'd really appreciate it.
This has ....LOADING... written all over it as I see it.

Thanks for any insight...
