Question .. When my Monk got to dubious to Paineel, she tried turning in the
Gnoll Molars when she was dubious .. Didn't take .. Hit Sneak and turned 'em
in just fine.

Now .. The question being .. If I take my druid self (with a brand spanking
new Druicide Stick from Naggy) to Cabilis with a bajillion bone chips, sneak
behind Trooper Mozo (I think that's him) .. Will I be able to turn in the
chips?
