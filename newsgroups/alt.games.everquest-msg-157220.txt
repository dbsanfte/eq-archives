That's nice.  200 per swing.  Every swing.  Never misses.  Must be some
sweet weapon.   At L54, with an Argent Protector, I hit for 180 max if
I'm not ATK or STR buffed.  Average against low blue mobs is around
half that, last time I checked.  Oh, and I miss.  A lot.  About a third
of the time against low blues, more against high blues, more still
against even or better cons.  But hey, I can hit for 180 with a 49 delay
weapon so I must have a great DPS, no?

Unless I've missed a recent change Warriors, Rangers, and Knights (not
sure about Rogues and Bards) are all on the same damage table.  Rangers
get self ATK buffs to go along with equal melee skill caps and thus will
outdamage Warriors like-for-like (hit harder and more often).

There is that little apples-and-oranges thing involved in your implied
comparison of a damage dealing class (Necro) to <the> healer class
(Cleric).  The balance here is that you're not thinking very hard about
what you post (I hope).

You aren't very good at it, was pretty much a wasted effort.

No, you didn't.  But I'm willing to believe that you imagine
you were being clever.

Missed again.  The Twain quote was not only unattributed, you didn't
bother to add the quote marks.

You're trying to claim that your stupidity makes you human?
