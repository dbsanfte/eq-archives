The paladin is the amazingly bad example.  Problem is that some classes
have a better shot at good gear at that level, because there is a lot 
more of their quested classs armor on the market (bards come to mind).
Suppose that's because a lot of people start bard twinks then give them
up because of twisting?

I just browsed the bazaar today - looks like the budget was about 1kpp -
That's what it would have cost for me to outfit a BL with the BL kit 
(I was wrong - it wasn't the SW quested, although many pieces looked
a lot like it, the BP is a Sarnak Emblazoned Tabard).
