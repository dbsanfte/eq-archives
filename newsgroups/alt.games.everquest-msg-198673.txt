Hi =)

If the servers would be up they would not post a new message with an
extended downtime ...

And like I wrote, even during the sheduled downtime (the first 2 hours lol)
all servers were shown as UP ....

Sure I know the run on the login server is big after a patch ... but dont
think this is the problem right now ...

Have fun in game

Christian
