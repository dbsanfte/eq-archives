Just adding to the list :

When my Barbarian Shaman was about 6ish - a beggar jumped me and
begged for SoW (Funny how that one keeps commin' up :o))

Well anyway - I told the poor soul that I wouldnt get SoW untill level
14 (I admit - my mistake there) ....

.... but he promptly tells me that Shamans gets SoW at 9 !!

Go figure. Being a beggar, OK, but being like this is beyond me

Anyway, I had to respond with a no - followed by the usual
name-calling. Weird......


Well that goes with the territory I guess - Good luck & good hunting
to you all
