Drop nothing, or very rarely.  The reason I do them instead is simply
because they are always level 60 so the exp is better than the hall mobs. 
You won't be doing these solo, a pocket cleric/shaman is a must.

You definitely need the single target one if you want to solo.  45-point DS
is a good step up from your lower one.

To get a pet to switch and stick requires the mob to be at "much lower
health".  Otherwise you're correct about the fact that your pet is getting
taunted.  One way to deal with this is a simple hotkey.

/pet back off
/pet attack

That way you erase all taunting and start pet fresh.  This may help him
stick to the one you want better.  No pauses needed (in fact, a pause will
likely get you killed).

Doesn't have to be down to frenzy range.  But it does have to be a decent
sized gap.

My magician grew up mostly before pet heals existed, and the rest of the way
before they were worth using and/or available (still doesn't have the big
Luclin heal or those two heals you mentioned from LoY or whereever). 
Whenever I did try to use pet healing, my mana seemed to just drain with
reckless abandon.  Nuking is almost always a better option.

You can nuke to your heart's content, and when the mob comes at you, run to
the other side of your pet while hitting the above hotkey.  As long as you
keep your pet between you and the mob, it taunts better than any warrior. 
This does mean that the mount might not be such a good idea, but with the
proper hotkey setup you can ditch it and get it back pretty quick.

Rains are fairly low aggro.  And even less aggro on the mobs that aren't
targeted.  Not that you can't pull a mob in with rains, but it's unlikely to
happen after just one.

Rain resist rates are set to make them almost always less efficient on
single targets.  On two mobs, they will pull ahead in efficiency.  I do use
rains on boss mobs (different post there) due to the lower aggro.

Definitely forget about being a cleric.  Magicians make nice booms, and
pretty sad clerics.   =)  The day (that will never come) that they give
magicians a pet-CH, will be the day that playing cleric to your pet becomes
a good strategy.
