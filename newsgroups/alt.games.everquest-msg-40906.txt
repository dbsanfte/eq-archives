Yep . Necros are generalist Int casters. They can do everything but cant
really do anything top notch . The gestalt effect of all their abilities
working together is incredibly impressive when you are looking at the very
best necros . Very few necros ever have this level of ability and there is
one school of thought that necros have it so easy that they never need to
learn advanced skills. Because they have no paramount use they are
frequently overlooked . Everyone loves the necro friend but you never have
to give up and log out when he leaves and you never have to wait for him to
log on to do something .
