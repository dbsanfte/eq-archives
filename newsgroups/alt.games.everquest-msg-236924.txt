One time I took the elevator to the top of PoK library - it goes way up.  I
then turned around and looked down the shaft.  I couldn't quite see all the
way down, so I scooted a little closer.  A little closer.  A little closer.
A little closer...and fell to my death.  I then got a tell from a PC who had
been nearby, "That must have hurt."

I was with a group in Tak and we decided that we're going to try to invis
past some mobs to get to the named.  I go invis, then use my right-click Eye
of Zomm eye to scout.  Everything is "scowling", so I tell everyone that
these things see invis.  I then see one of my invised groupmates run past
them, so I'm confused, but figure somehow invis must work as long as you run
past them really quick.  So I start running and everything jumps me.  I die
quick and leave the rest of the group with a mess.  Truly a Doh! moment.
