Our guild had a fun event tonight.  Several of us created rogues and worked
them up till they got hide(L3).  Then we attempted to invade the lair of
Vox.  We made it quite a ways in before hide and sneak failed.  I was very
careful to con everything that I needed to go close to and the two times
that I was seen they definitely conned indifferent.  Once it failed near a
goblin elite, and once near an ice giant (I got past the diplomat).

Now I had heard (1) that hide is like invisibility except with no limit on
duration, and (2) that once invisible no mob can see through it unless they
have that ability or spell on them in which case they will con scowling.  It
seems to me that one of our assumptions is wrong.  Why does hide fail?
