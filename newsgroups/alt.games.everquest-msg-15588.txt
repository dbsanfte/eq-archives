No, you can't put any container inside any other container.

You didn't need help, you figured it out on your own. :)  No-rent does,
indeed, mean that it doesn't last forever.  Magicians (and I think shaman)
can summon bags that give 100% weight reduction (no matter what's inside, it
doesn't increase your encumberance).

The downside is that they "poof" if you're offline for more than 30 minutes.
I would strongly suggest you never put anything into it that you'd be
hearbroken to lose.  Even if you have a great memory and remember to remove
it before logging, that doesn't save you from your ISP or power crapping out
for an hour or two unexpectedly.
