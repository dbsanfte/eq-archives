No objection to the principle then, but good luck getting them to implement
it.   Instead of calculating how hard mobs are in a given zone, on average,
and setting one variable based on that, they would have to do that
calculation for each mob.  I doubt SOE would be willing to spend the time on
it.

The world is currently huge, and is filled with many places that give really
good experience.  If you can get around the BYOG problem, no reason you
shouldn't be there already.
