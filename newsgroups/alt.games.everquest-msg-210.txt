You can take 10000 damage if you jump off the cliff at the top of the ramp
in Eastern Karana leading to Highpass. You might need SoW for the full
affect, I had it on, but maybe you can clear the wall without it. If you
just love falling from a great height, I recommend the diving platform in
Lake Rathe. You fall from a great height and take zero damage.
