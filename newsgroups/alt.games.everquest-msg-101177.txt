WinXP
512M RAM
Athlon 1.4ish (FSB raised, multi lowered)
GeForce 3 Ti200, clocked almost to GF3 Ti500 speeds.
DX8.1, DSL

I still get slightly jerky framerates in Kelethin when it's crowded in
front of the bank (mind you, this is at 32bpp color and max clip).
They go away if I turn off the new models.  For normal play, I do OK.  
I could see a raid requiring a throttle-back though.
