Some thoughts others might not already have posted:

    1) In mid to late 50's wizards can easily run out of mana and fall
behind an SK, let alone a DPS class. (observation from log parses of two
different wizzies, regular group situation PoN). This is a simple function
of mobs having 12-14k hit points, damage over time classes beat the wizzy
spells at that level. Shouldn't be the case, but appears to be. On the other
hand, a mid-high 50's wizard quad kiting probably out damages the rest of
the group taking part in that log.

    2) Necros in groups can do a surprisingly high amount of damage,
especially if the tank gets their pet positioning right. Slightly off-topic
but not really: Necros can also deliver more mana right where its needed,
wherever the bottleneck is (healing, agro, dps, whatever) than any other
class to my knowledge. Other classes can bring more mana regen to a group
total, but an army moves at the speed of its slowest unit, and a group with
one key character oom is the next worst thing to an oom group.

    3) You're clearly asking about small and large group tactics, so your
question is fairly silly. If you're looking for dps, any of the dps classes
will do you some good... but there are classes that may not add a
spectacular amount of DPS on their own but as part of a group add a
bucketload. Chanter haste on a group heavy in DPS melees and pet casters
will add more dps than any single dps class could, ditto shammy buffs in the
same situation. A healer or mana regen addition in many cases can up the
output of a group by far more than any dps class addition... agro management
can drastically up caster output... But the really silly part of your
question is that it equates to "how long is a piece of string"; the answer
is entirely situational.

    If you were asking to start one of these Endless Threads (no drop but
certainly not lore) then you win a prize ;)

    If you were posting because you were thinking about making a dps class,
I reckon the best advice people give for that one is "play the class you
feel drawn to". It's a game, most ppl don't crunch the numbers at all, who's
best IS situational and frankly all of the DPS classes have their high and
low points, both in terms of levels where they're good or bad and group
situations where they suit or don't. One example here is rangers; ask any
level 43 ranger who is untwinked, a main, and not in a raiding guild what
they think of the class. Now ask a 65 ranger with a bunch of AA's and a cool
bow. Next, introduce them. <g>

    If you were posting because you find yourself wondering about what class
to add to your groups and want to know the mathematical facts, my advice is
to type /log and then go download a log parser. If you want facts crunch the
numbers yourself, you are the person with the perfect view to see who does
what in your groups.

    Hmm except I haven't found a way to log and parse other ppl's dot spell
dmg yet - any ideas anyone? lol
