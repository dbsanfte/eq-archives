>1.  What is song twisting, and how do you do it?

Song twisting is a technique for having more than one song effect going
at once.  Bard songs, in general, take 3 seconds to cast. Once cast, the
duration of the effect is ("however long you continue to play the song" +
12 seconds). So you get more effects going by stopping the song as soon
as you get it cast, then start casting a new one during the 12 seconds
before song #1 wears off. When song #2 is done casting, stop singing song
#2 and restart song #1 again. This is a two-song twist, because you have
two song effects up continuously. A three-song twist is where you play
three songs in rotation, etc.

A player with reasonable eye-hand coordination, with a reasonable internet
connection, in a lag-free zone should be able to do a three-song twist
after a small amount of practice. Four-song twists are reported by experts.
Five-song twists fall into the "mythic" category.


>2.  Do you have to have instruments to play the songs?  My newbie Bard has a
>weapon but doesn't have any instruments.

In general, you can play any song with any instruments, or even no instruments
at all. Most songs will have more effect if you play them with the right
instrument.  Some songs will have even more effect if you play them with
a magical version of the right instrument. For Singing-based songs, it
doesn't matter either way.

The only way to get skill ups is if you are playing a song with the correct
instrument. You can get skill ups in Singing-based songs regardless of what
instruments (if any) you have equiped.

Some songs *require* a particular instrument to work. Group (Invis+See
Invis) song can only be played with a Wind instrument in hand.


>3.  Do you switch between the instrument and your weapon when your hunting
>verses medding?

*I* do, if I feel like I'll have enough time between pulls where the extra
effect will make up for the hassle of switching equipment around. And I
don't med yet in any event. At my level, any benefits I get for sitting
down, I can more than make up by playing songs instead.

And in some cases, it works better to blow off weapons entirely, keep
instruments equipped at all times, and avoid melee combat.


As others have stated, <www.eqdiva.com> is *the* definitive EQ Bard site.
