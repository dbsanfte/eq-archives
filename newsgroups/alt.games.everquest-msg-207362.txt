I laughed when I read this.  I said exactly the same thing months ago 
during beta.  Ultimately that is the game, it is Raph and his simulated 
world.

Not really, there is very little that is worthwhile in the game other 
than the playing of it.  Concepts such as uber loot don't exist and if 
they stay true to their plan, won't.  The only thing of value at this 
point is the ability to make a guild which requires a PA hall.  You 
don't have to go PvP to get that, but those who have succeeded this 
rapidly have definitely done some serious damage to the economy.  This 
was a bad design choice, I don't blame the folks who've done what 
they've done to get there, I blame the developers for sticking with the 
crazy idea of the hall being tied to guild creation.

Actually this was changed and the result is worse than what they avoided 
by not limiting your ability to make low end items as you progressed. 
The architects and the PA hall fiasco is a good example.  If they had 
kept the low end limits in place theoretically the highest level 
architects would have provided a market for lower end craftsmen to 
create components the higher folks needed.  As it stands the PA 
powercrafters supported by their entire guilds have been able to create 
their PA halls by flooding the market with goods priced below cost to 
the average crafter.  You now have an elite group at the top and a 
flooded market for those who follow behind.  If they had left it as 
originally thought out, those elite would need an army of lower level 
crafters to provide them with parts for their PA hall or other large 
items.  Instead the rest of the architects are faced with either 
abandoning the trade or trying to sell the things they make for less 
than they can sell the supplies used to make them.

This is just one example where a full phase 4 beta would have 
demonstrated flaws in their theories, let alone their infrastructure. 
The networking and database issues they can of course resolve eventually 
with only a fair bit of bitterness from those who were frustrated or 
(like myself) lost everything they had gained from 2 weeks of hard work 
to a database issue, but the economy itself may never recover from some 
of their mistakes.

spellcheck recommends that uberloot be replace with uber loot <g>
