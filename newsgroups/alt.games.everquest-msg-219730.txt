Actually, Khosh, one can make a strong argument for damage to songbird
populations in the USA...you needn't go to Australia. :)  My father is an
ornithologist and raptor rehabilitator, who also has a lot of birdfeeders
on the back deck.  He told our neighbors again and again to make their
cats indoor cats after he got tired of having his bird feeders used as the
local feline steak and grill.  When they ignored him, he started keeping
the garden hose handy, and while I was young at the time, I seem to recall
him being accused by locals of having "disappeared" their cats.  I have no
idea if their accusations were founded or not...cat's get hit by cars a
lot...but I wouldn't entirely put it past my dad.  After all, the eagles
and owls he took care of do need variety in their diet from time to
time...*cough*

Yeah, that's it! Let your cats breed without control...just...um...send
the kittens onto my dad. He'll make them a nice cozy spot in the bird
cage...ignore the golden eagle over there...she's harmless really.

<---- is not totally heartless and loves her own two cats, but like's to
keep "being humane" in perspective.
