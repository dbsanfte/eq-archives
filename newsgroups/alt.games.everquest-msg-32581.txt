The presence of this particular breed of moron seems to be a constant.
I ran into them regularly when I was a Fidonet BBS operator and echo
moderator - there was always some idiot who screamed about his
"rights" of free speech, and how I couldn't do anything about what he
wanted to say.

I always enjoyed giving them clear lessons about how it wasn't their
BBS or echo - it was mine.

Every now and again one of the brighter ones would actually grasp the
basics after such a demonstration, and would decide they were going to
start their own BBS and/or echo. They were usually then presented with
the next hard lessons - setting either up required a goodly amount of
effort and technical skills, and no one else was interested in
visiting their sad little kingdoms.
