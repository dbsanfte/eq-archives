You have to look at the comparable monk pieces out there. A twink might pay
600pp to 1500pp for a full set just for the look, and just to have it.  But
for the monks (like me) who  scrimp and save every pp, no way would I pay
that. I've heard of 300pp for the tunic.. well, a lockjaw vest (30pp) and a
foreman's tunic (120pp) are MUCH better. The feet are worth more because
magic footwear is hard to find. I think the leggings are pretty decent, and
the mantle. I've followed the whole pricing discussion on eqtraders with
some amusement. While I understand the desire to make back some money for
time and effort spent, I can't see charging 300pp for a piece of armor with
stats bested by something costing 1/10th the price.

For me, I got the slippers for free from someone in a pickup group. I gave
her a bunch of crystalline silk that I had in the bank. Then another friend
did me a "favor" and bought a bunch of pieces for 200pp. He kept the tunic
(because I'm wearing a CCS), and I'm wearing leggings, sleeves, one
wristband and that's it. The rest of what I have is better. And, I'm only
wearing the leggings because I have the CCS to cover them.. I think the
yellow is pretty ugly (my opinion of course).

In any event, you'll need to see what it's going for on your server. I'd
make the pieces as they are ordered, so you aren't stuck with a bunch of
tunics or whatever. The other issue you have is that people just trying to
skill up will be dumping the pieces on vendors. While some people on
eqtraders said they made 10Kpp selling Wu's, that window of opportunity may
have passed.
