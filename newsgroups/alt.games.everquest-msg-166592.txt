/agree

Many times when I zone in to the bazaar, I make a straight line towards
the arena and do mot searching from there.  And I too will buy things at a
slightly higher price if it means I dont have to go over to the
overcrowded, laggy, hard to click on people crammed shoulder to shoulder
near the entrance.

On a side note, what angers me even more is when people decide they want
to sit down/trade/stand at the zone-in entrance from Nexus to bazaar.  Too
many times have I zoned in to find myself standing on top of someone, or
trying to walk over people, and its nearly impossible to get by.  A few
times, I have even been bumped out of the zone by people just standing
there.  IMHO they need another zone-in point from Nexus. I mean I can get
around it by using the little teleporter thing in Nexus to go to SH THEN
to the bazaar, but thats such a pain in the arse.
