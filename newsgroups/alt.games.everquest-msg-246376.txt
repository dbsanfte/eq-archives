How so?  If Sony wants to do something malicious, they can do it just as
well from the game as from the ActiveX component.  If Sony doesn't want to
do anything malicious, then your risk is from bugs in the code, and the
ActiveX component is simpler and easier to code than the game, and is much
less likely to have bugs.
