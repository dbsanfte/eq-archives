Really Ben Sisson,I would have expected a more balanced
analysis from you concerning Rangers.
What about that we are able to deal great damage without
standing close to the mob?
And I use my buffs a lot in *groups*,not only SoP and CoR.
And what about the walk in the park that was the levels 1 to 56 ?
What about solo capabilities ? I feel with the warriors!
And try to ask a Cleric,what he thinks about an AA like Innate
Camouflage.

For me it was clear when I started my Ranger,that I have to pay
a price for all the convenience I enjoy,I would never demand
to outdamage a pure melee class.
