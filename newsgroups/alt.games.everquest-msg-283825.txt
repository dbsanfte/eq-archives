So why grumble about Necromancer's NOT giving you their mana???
You're now saying your mana regen is not the problem!  Make your mind
up  :D  

As Faeander says, just because a Necro is under 50% doesn't mean they
necessarily need a heal off you - like him, I run my Necro on low HP
pretty often, and it's normal.  Routine, even. Well, that said, I
suppose nowadays I leech my HP to mana and then take a regen potion or
heal potion, so my HP don't go *that* low now, but the low hitpoints
do happen now and again.  Necrmancers can soon sort that out by
leeching the next mob...

But I still don't NEED a heal on me every 5 minutes.
