I played it when I was bored with EQ. Now, I am back to EQ. I got
bored with DAOC after about a week and a half. I think capture my
attention is the good term. It looks great, but if every zone looks
like the LOIO, sure it will look great. EQ player base is better, I
have more fun with my people.
One nice thing about DAOC is many doods went there, and they are just
beginning to trickle back....
