As recently as a month ago I was getting 8pp which was right in line with my relatively low charisma.

With charisma of 106+ and good faction with your vendor you should get almost 10pp.  I've seen as little as 5pp offered
from some vendors with bad charisma.

The LS trade in book is worth much less

I used to make a fortune buying GLS from players who were underbidding each other selling them to faction hunters;
knowing I could get 9pp 8gp for them, buying in bulk at 3pp each (still more than vendors were offering) was like
printing up money, -plus- the faction boost is huge in your single digits and low teens.
