Following an incident with my dwarf cleric, I wondered if anyone knows the
answer to this:-

If you visit a different race's guild you can buy eg spells without
problems, but can't train. You get a rude insult about your race, and con
apprehensive to the trainers (obviously I'm not talking about good
characters visiting Neriak or dark elves in Qeynos).

If you improve faction through quests etc does that enable you to train, or
will the trainers still only see your race and react to that?

Thanks for any answers.

Loremaster
