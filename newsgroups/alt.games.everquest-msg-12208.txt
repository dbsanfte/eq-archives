Did you use an area affect spell? That;s the only thing I can think
of, Tazian is one of the Gypsy merchants in the small camp to the
north-west of the Nektulos entrance (behind the tower with shadowed
men). My Barbarian is amiable to all of them, they are humans, and
shouldn't be KOS to a halfling. I have seen them kill Fire Elementals
many times, if you used an AOE that could have caused the pet to turn
on you.
