There is a limit to the freedom I want.

But the thing is, its a tug of war between two things.

1. You can limit freedom of action
2. You can make action have consequences

Both ways have their strengths, but EQ2 is all about the first one
(the gamey solution in my eternal duel between gameyness vs
worldliness) and I want to see more of the second one.

I want to play with the assholes. I want them somehow punished when
they do something stupid - not necessarily by GMs either, I would
prefer something more controllable even if subconscious. I don't want
to be hamstrung.
