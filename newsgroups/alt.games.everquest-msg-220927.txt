Lol, OK, Beastlords, I forgot bards, but BLs get a 65% slow, eventually, 
if they get their hands on that level 65 spell.  Necros are great for 
undead, only 5% less than shaman slow as I recall.

Enchanter slow is only 5% lower than Shaman slow at the high end.  At the 
low end, Enchatners actually have a better slow than Shaman.  I don't 
recall what level the shaman finally pulls ahead as the best slower in 
the game, somewhere in the 30s maybe, which, is around where the slow is 
enough to actually be really noticable too.
