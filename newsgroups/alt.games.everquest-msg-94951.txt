I think this is better than it used to be. When EQ first came out,
there were a lot of GM's that were essentially bandits. The only
reason they were GM's was so that they could twink their friends and
alt characters. I think that situation got cleaned up considerably
when a bunch of GM's were booted, but there are probably still cases
of favoritism and unfair treatment.

My personal experience of this was back when EQ first came out, and I
was grouped with some cleric guy. No one on any server at that time
was over level 20, and yet this cleric I was grouped with had crazy
gear that I've never seen anywhere in 3 subsequent years of playing
EQ. That in itself would not mean anything, but at one point I died
during the exp grind, and before I can run back from my bind spot, the
cleric sends me a tell "hold on, my GM friend will TP you back". 5
seconds later im tp'd back to the party. Again, the cleric was like
level 16 at this point. I doubt any players on the server had access
to revive or ressurect at this point. I figured that the cleric was
running a GM account on another computer, and using that GM account to
twink his "player" character.

I'm not the pet of a GM, but I've at least gotten the basic help for
lost corpses and such from GM's.

I remember one time I was sitting by the aviak tower in so ro, when I
notice off in the far distance a shape running towards me. I watch it
in a sort of stunned amazement for awhile, until I realize that the
undead cyclops is headed right for me at top speed, and it looks mad
as hell. What was weird is that I had not agroed the cyclops. My first
inkling of it's existence was when it came charging out of the
distance headed right for me. I guess it's possible the mob was under
the world or something, and I agroed it across the Y axis unwittingly.
However, I've always had a nagging suspiscion that deep in Verant HQ
there is a computer operator geek laughing his ass off as he spawns
random uber mobs and makes them agro on unsuspecting chumps.
