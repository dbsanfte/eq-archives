    You think that's bad?  Here I am, sitting on the NK side of the bridge
that leads to EK.  I'm in wolf-form, medding after a nasty bout with a
Griffon.  Well, this guy comes up and says "Port me to EK NOW!"  My first
instinct was to type "Go soak your snout" or something similar...  Then, I
did a double take as I noticed the destination.  So, I typed "It's across
the bloody bridge!!!"  He did a /rude and went on his way...  I put him in
my /ignore list...  twit... :)
