I'm begging to differ.  The world size is so much larger now that a
server size of 3-400 would be a ghost town.  With 250+ zones now, that
would be close to a zone each.  I'm thinking they'd have to merge by
then to keep up the illusion of being a multiplayer game, and to cater
to the classes that cannot solo viably.

Heck, given the current wasteland feel, I think they'll start doing it
sooner, rather than later.
