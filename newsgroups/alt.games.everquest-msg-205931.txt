No, a tossup between second and third.
For "cheals"
Cleric
Druid
Shaman

For heals over time (or "efficient heals")
Cleric
Shaman
Druid

K lets just clear one thing up. I am level 65, i have and use quiesensce.
You aren't, and don't.

Quiesence is a spell I use on a daily basis, in elemental exp groups, in
tier 2 slumming sessions, vulak raids to Solusek Ro, to PoEarth and PoFire
named.  It has awsome use.

Tnargs isn't a cheal type spell.  Its just a fast heal, affected by foci
unlike cheal.
Like I said, its a different kind of spell.

Do you have a clue? I mean seriously...
Lets see, SoW + ATK or SoW + annoying bouncy lag inducing effect?
Acumen, a junk buff?  See invis, Ultravision and massive stamina
regeneration for over 1 hour (before foci and AA extensions) is a pretty
nice spell IMO..

Go fight a flurrying rampaging mob and then fight him crippled, and tell me
you don't spot any difference.

Spot healing requires fast casting heals, it doesn't matter if they land for
500 or 2k, it just has to land asap.
Like i said, its a safeguard against spikes, not to keep the tank alive.
