Okay, went to Dawnshroud for the first time after spending a few levels in
Marus Seru.  Fighting a lightcrawler (which I had done quite a bit in Marus
Seru) - all of a sudden, screen goes completely black.

WTF?

System problem of some kind.  Start poking around - nothing I can find.
Drivers? Check.  RAM? Check.  Heat?  Check.  Damn - must've been a fluke.

Start fighting again.  *Blink* screen goes black.  Yikes!  Must've been the
last patch.

/ooc Anyone else having problems?  Keep getting blank screen.

And the reply?

Lightcrawlers here cast *blind*...

Doh.
