I don't want to get in an oldtimers pissing contest.  One thought,
if you've been on line forever, you'll have learned to type, unless
(and I don't mean to rule this out or belittle it) you have some
form of partial paralysis or missing fingers or mental problems.
Unless you are saying that you are still online with the same machine,
and have to hand code by punching holes in punch cards.

Regardless of how many decades you've been on the net,
plz saves three letters over please, thx saves three letters
over thanks, and in each case you'll find about half your
intended audience takes an opposite meaning.

"Please" means "I understand this is a favor I am asking,
and I"m a polite and well meaning person"

Plz may translate as that in your target's head... or it may
translate as "I'm a lazy bugger who wants something of
-your- time and -your- (mana, loot, information... whatever
it is the person is asking for) but isn't willing to spend the
extra tenth of a second to type out 'please' instead of plz.
I'm also too ignorant to realize you might take this wrong."

Thanks means "I understand that you just did me a favor,
and I appreciate it."

Thx may translate as that in your target's head... or it
may translate as "while I understand that you just spent
your time and (mana, loot, information... whatever
it is the person recieved) helping me out, and I appreciate
it, I don't think its worth typing out the whole word
'thanks', I mean, thats an extra three letters I'd have to
type, my fingers might start bleeding."

Now if your target approaches you brimming over with
abbreviations, you can be pretty sure he's going to
translate plz as please, thx as thanks, and like you, never
understand why anyone else would take it differently.
But unless you know in advance, you are gambling that
your good intentions are going to be misunderstood, and
what you win if you are -not- is that you save typing three
(hey, assume you say both, thats six!) letters, while what
you lose if you are is at least some of that person's respect.

Rather than labor to save three letters, I reccomend adding
more; use the /bow, /thank, /smile emotes built into the game.
in particular, it takes fewer letters to /bow than it does to
"thank" or "please" and yet utilizes the graphic engine to
make a far bigger display, as well as spitting out a (canned)
text message ten times longer. Talk about saving typing!

"thanks, I got my level back!"
