Unless you are already resigned to following the masses to Lake of Ill
Manners, you could head on up to Highpass. You could easily get into
some Orc Groups at the Kithicorre side of the pass until you make a
couple levels, then you can move into Highkeep and hunt in the basement.
In my warrior's 41 levels, that zone was the most efficient, fast xp
generating, convenient place I've ever fought. I went from 22 to 30
there and it didn't take long.
