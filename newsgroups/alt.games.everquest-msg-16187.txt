How about power leveling the cleric to 34?  Get a guildie enchanter and head
back to Najena.  You bring MOB down to sliver of health, stop fighting, mem
blur, mem blur, mem blur, CLERIC melee and nuke to finish off.  Boring as
hell for you and enchanter, but a steady flow of MOB's and little chance of
trouble. Once he gets to 34 your options are anywhere.
