    You've misplaced emphasis. If you kill Tormax because you want FT
booties for a_guild_wizard03, and the other guild has to wait a week, great.
More power to you. If you kill Tormax just because you don't want anyone
else to kill Tormax that week, and rot the loot, you're an arse. You COULD
have been out getting something to make yourself better, but instead chose
to keep someone else at the same power level. That is what I find obscene.

    Exactly my point. YOU, the guild waking the Sleeper, could be off doing
a ton of other things. But instead you're taking the time to permanently
dick over someone. I heard the whining from top guilds about not being able
to attack a timelocked AoW, I heard the whining pre-Luclin about there "not
being enough to kill". So I know that those top guilds didn't like the idea
of people shutting them out from content either, and I also know they took
away one of the few challenges (Ventani) that they could face by waking the
Sleeper. There's also the issue of what guilds that couldn't kill Ventani
but could kill the other warders would do - those other three also went
away.

    We killed AoW last night. The first main tank's SoD wasn't purchased in
EC, nor was the tank purchased on E-Bay.

    So comment on some of the things we've seen on my server:

    Guild two is trying NToV for the first time, has killed Aary, is moving
in. Guild one, the previous monopoly guild, tries to CotH to the old safe
spot, starts pulling just as guild two gets there, screws up, wipes everyone
out. Can you see a solution here that doesn't involve a GM?

    Guild three has been clearing Myga's PH for some time now. Myga pops -
and an invis Guild one bard that had been sitting there immediately pulls
Myga and starts kiting it while other guild one members arrive to kill it.
Should "first aggro, nyeah nyeah" be the rule, or should a GM's intervention
be sought?

    (You'll love this one.) Guild four's cleric is in Skyfire, "claiming"
Ragefire. Rage pops, guild five is just porting in to nab him. Guild four,
feeling rushed, kills the human Ragefire but wipes to Dragon Ragefire except
for a druid that arrives after the battle. Guild five's druid and guild
four's druid both start a kite tug-of-war on Dragon Ragefire at once,
neither having seen the other when they first started. Guild five engages,
then guild four piles in, Dragon Ragefire dies with kill credit to a guild
five group. A guild four cleric loots the box, though, claiming he was their
triggered spawn. No GM required here? Hell, I know the rules and I have no
idea who is in the right on this one!

    Point is this: in a lot of cases, what we would regard as "being there"
(in zone, buffed up, clearing to the target) isn't respected by other
players. Those players will use every trick in the book to touch the target
first, which they think is "engaging" and gives them all rights to the
spawn. Then if they wipe there'll be the fights over who gets the next shot
at the mob. And so on. I'm glad GMs are there to enforce the PNP, because if
they didn't this cheeseball crap would go on forever.

    We also have this on our server, and it's why we went FFA (with
rotations) from calendar. There's three guilds called "The Alliance"
collectively who'd do this exact thing on the calendar. However, our server
GMs have intelligence above that of a potted fern and have been able to tell
that the three guilds act as one. They treat them accordingly in disputes of
this nature. Tell me - what do you suppose would happen if a GM hadn't
interceded and set some order to things? Would it have rhymed with "brain"
and "crane"? Would that have been better?

    Takes two to tango. Doesn't matter if we respect people in a zone
already, or if we allow people to try and wipe until they give up, or if we
want to set rotations on things only we and one other guild can kill. If the
other party's idea of a fair settlement is always "we get, you go har har!"
then talking isn't going to solve anything. Must be nice being on a server
where you're pretty much the lone top dog. :-/
