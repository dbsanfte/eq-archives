 Yes suprisingly enough not 1 but 2 GMs did

 Throught their inaction. Seea child steal a candy bar and not do
anything teaches the child theres no concequences to stealing. That I
would say is negative behaviour and not doing anything about it is the
reinforcing part.

 They had 3 chances, only answered 2 with the 'Sorry we can't help
you' canned response. However I made such nuisance in pok that they
HAD to respond. I eventually got the item and now can't group or get
buffs... aka blacklisted. Sucks to fight for whats right. and no bs
about it only being a game, I pay with real cash and real time.
