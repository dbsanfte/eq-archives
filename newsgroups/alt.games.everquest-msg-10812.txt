It's a little different.  First of all, Warriors appreciate knowing that a
Heal is on the way.  Keep in mind there's a significant delay between a
Cleric casting a GHeal and the spell actually restoring hitpoints, so it's
gratifying to the Warriors to know that relief is on the way. Also, no news
is *bad* news - if a Warrior's health is going down and the Cleric isn't
saying anything, it may be time to think about doing something drastic.  The
Cleric may be in a lag spike, may have fallen asleep, or may be under attack
and unable to cast.

Where the announcement comes in *real* useful is in a group with two or more
healers.  By setting up this macro, healers don't end up wasting mana
casting GHeal on someone who is about to go back to full health.  I can't
tell you how annoying it is when I cast GHeal only to find that the Paladin
has cast Lay on Hands and didn't need my help.  By announcing my GHeal, the
Pally knows that he/she doesn't need to LoH.

On a more fundamental level, good communications is the key to a successful
group.  Messages about incoming monsters, addtional monsters joining in, the
status of everyone's mana, which party member you're /assisting and the like
help the party function efficiently.  By exchanging this kind of
information, everyone gets a good feel for how the battle is going and what
steps are needed for survival.

I admit, at first I found the healing announcements annoying when I started
to group.  It didn't take me long to begin to appreciate them, however, and
to realize that someone who announces their heals is someone who knows how
to group - and *that* is a highly appreciated skill these days.  :)
