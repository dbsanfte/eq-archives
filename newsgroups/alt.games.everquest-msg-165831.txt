Anyone else notice in the last few days that servers are lagging an
disconnecting a lot more? Was playing tonight and everytime I zoned
I'd get kicked and if I didn't zone within 10 minutes I'd go LD.
Sat in chat for a while and it seems like everyone had the same
thing happening. One of the gms had said something about
their being possable trouble on one of the routers in ny somewhere.
Really sucked. Hope they fix it soon. My free month is almost up =)
