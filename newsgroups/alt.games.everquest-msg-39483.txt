This does not affect only enchanters but any class that is not that affective
at soloing experience giving mobs. TCC prevents any person to solo and get the
reward to any mob that has just turned non-experience giving. So any class
that has to wait a level or two before soloing a mob that your solo classes
can do a couple levels lower are out of luck. i.e. enchanters, majority of
melee classes, clerics
