I usually just sell my stuff at the lowest price in the bazaar, sometimes
even 1000's of pp less than the lowest price set. Why? Because i got alot of
plat, and i got lots of phat lewt too, so i just want to get rid of it at a
price i can live with.

Sometimes when a person logs on in the same space as you, you will be
slightly moved. This can cause you to be pushed away etc. Also some traders
warp invisible after a while (a known bug, don't know if this has been
fixed).

Just accept that some of us are in uber guilds, have nifty shit and tons of
plat.
