2003.02.02

    I hear alot of thoughts about Everquest 2 coming out, I'd just
like to reassure people that with all the patching they are currently
doing you will see Everquest 2 come out in 2004 early 2005.  I don't
own the Gold Edition of Everquest just the Trilogy. and walk
everywhere with my compass and map that came with the game.  I am
hoping to buy POP and Shadows. within the next month. for the simple
fact of the matter is I have not been able to get into groups at all.
Why well frankly there are none.  perhaps it is just my server. but I
have found the odd group so it is not that bad.  Although Right now my
Dark Elf Necromancer has hit level 13, which is cool I have all my
gear and have done some of the quests.  So I'm having alot of Fun.
Although I find it strange to run into new people that are level 8 or
9 and have no gear. And don't know about quests or where to get them
or where they are.  I've been playing on-line for a month now and have
done some research on the web on how the game works and what spells
are good for me, and where to get things.  and just by talking with
people.  Also when my EQ went all screwy after the last patch. I fixed
it by looking at the Knowledge base on the website.   Maybe its just
me I just find it hard when I run into people that are level 10 or
even higher and have no idea whats going on, or where to get quests or
heck that there are even quests in the Game.  This is Sort of one of
those weird rambling posts but I'm done now.  I would just like to
thank the nice people in this new group that have helped me out along
the way and the nice people I have met on My server Kane-Bayle.


Anyway Weird thoughts and my two Cents or pp or whatever lol
