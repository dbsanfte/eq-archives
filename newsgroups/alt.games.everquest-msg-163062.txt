Hello,

I was wondering if anyone could help me with some information.  I was
visiting http://www.planeteq.com/eqwadb/ (The EQ weapons database) in an
attempt to see what weapons would be good for me.  Could someone explain the
difference between "Damage Per Second" "Damage Per Round" and "Damage per
second per round" - which is the most important when comparing weapons?  and
what exactly is a round?

Thanks
