I've noticed other encs in the guild have this problem.  Generally, it's 
because they want to have VoQ, VQ, and GoD up at all times for some 
goforsaken reason. :) True, I enjoy when random_melee_006 calls for haste 
and I can just /tar, click, and go, but I just wouldn't consider it an 
emergency, they can wait a couple seconds while I throw the buff of choice 
in the empty slot. :)

Naw.  Well, maybe the druid.  But Wizards, IMO, would do fine with 6 spell 
slots. :) Nuke, snare, root, concussion, harvest... umm... ok, throw in 
another nuke. :)

Sorry, let me clarify.  I meant that it takes 2 seconds of actually 
sitting down and drawing potential aggro to yourself.  I don't see much 
cause to worry about the 4-5 seconds fumbling through the menu.  If it's a 
spell you're going to need to cast -now-, it should already have been 
memmed anyway, and we have 8 slots for that, which is plenty, in my 
opinion.  The big difference is now you do menu fumbling while standing 
up, rather than spellbook fumbling while seated.

But yeah... the number of times I've accidentally memmed Tranq instead of 
VoQ alone approaches uncountable. :)

Hm, I haven't hit that limit yet.  Honestly, I mainly use /memspellset for 
when I'm dead, and need to remem everything.  Others have gotten good use 
out of it, supposedly, which is why I mentioned it, but I mainly use the 
dropdown menus.  The one exception being when the raidleaders decide to 
call for aoe chain stuns without warning, bastards.  Then I thank my 
lucky stars for spell sets. :) And then I invariably have to inform at 
least one other enchanter that Word of Morell is not in fact a stun, 
despite its pretty blue gem with a head on it. :)
