Thats the Gnoll Fur Bundle Quest, which is on Alakhazam. But it doesn't use
the flawless/perfect pelts, it use Patch(es) of Gnoll Fur. 4 of those give
you a Gnoll Fur Patch, 4 of those combine into a Gnoll Fur Quarter, and 4 of
those combine into the Gnoll Fur Bundle. You can keep it(decent for a
newbie, like I was when i did this) or you can turn it in for a bit of gold,
exp, faction and I think an item in Halas.
