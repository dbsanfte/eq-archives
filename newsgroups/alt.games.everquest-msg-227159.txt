Couple questions in one post, actually:

My 52 enchanter, I haven't played in a while (except for the past 4 hours),
so I'm getting used to playing him again.  Whenever I log into him for a
minute or so, I'm almost always asked to go on an adventure.. I don't have
the expansion on that account, and I haven't gone on any adventures on my
other account.. are they worth doing for him (I know that question can lead
to a lot of stuff about if LDoN is good and other stuff, but simply: is it
worth getting the expansion if I only play him for a few hours at a time,
don't bring my own groups, etc).

Second question, I've been in a couple different planes, but otherwise I'm
pretty new to them.. should I go in and just look for a group, or should I
annouce that i'm a newbie to this plane and would like to be schooled in it
by any group willing.. I'm betting there is a lot less of a chance to get a
group, but I don't want people thinking I know what to do beyond the regular
chantie stuff.

Third (maybe last, we'll see), I've been playing my 30 necro a lot duoing
with my 30 druid friend.  We're currently fighting at the sarnak fort in
LoIO.  Other hunting suggestions?  We fought in Marus Saru for a while,
that's where I taught him to kite, was good fun.  Should we head to OT?
Suggestions would be wonderful.

Sorry about this being so long,

~Chris
