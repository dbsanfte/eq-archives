just playing mana song all the time.

making 1 in the first place? :)

> Cleric:
> - Not buffing at least MT

letting anybody die in a regular run of the mill pull.  not buffing at least
the puller, tank, and mezzer.

later on, id expand that to.. clerics who sit on their ass, stand up to
heal, sit down, stand up to loot, sit down.

using wrong healing spells.. no, you dont cheal a caster.  knowing when to
use celestial and when to use remedy.. chealing for uneffective amounts of
hp (like 3/4 life and chealing).. casting a cheal then sitting down..
healing the puller while hes on a pull (fucktards still do this in places
like ToV - not my guilds clerics im glad to say)..  big healing the monk on
the pull, with several mobs inc, cuz your gonna be dead before they are a)
taunted   b) mezzed

> Druid:
> - No snare on target in agro enviroment

not using their spells effectively..  DS, debuffs, snare, dots, nukes..
I've seen druids who think they just need to snare and sit back down / go
afk...  using dots when nukes would be better (e.g prevents mob being
mezzed)

> Enchanter:
> - Not mezzing adds
> - Not mana/haste buffing

not using the variety of spells they have to control adds..  e.g stuns, ae
stuns
letting mobs gate by not stunning/sieving

> Mage:
> - Unengaged pet

being unprepared... e.g the shits hit the fan, group is oom and dieing.. hi
wtf is the mod rod.  not debuffing mobs.   unengaged pet is just the sign of
an afk mage


> Monk:
> - Not announcing when mend is up

im a bad player then.   i dont announce mend, i dont even use it "at group"
80% of the time.  mend is my get out of jail card when the cleric fucks up
("cheal inc for monk_01 in t10 seconds" while im at 600hp and the mob is
hitting for 200..)

Mends my get out of jail card when a pull goes wrong.. when FD fails and im
getting beat on, when casters keep breaking my FD

mend helps me if the group/raid wiped and i need to move the mob, tank the
mob, move corpses etc

> Necromancer:
> - Using fear in high agro enviroment

not using their wide range of spells.. they arent just mana batteries.. they
arent just a "dot and sit" class.. they can crowd control, heal, "buff" the
group, dot, nuke..

> Paladin:
> - ??

not using his mana effectively?

> Ranger:
> - ?? no arrows

hmm

> Rouge:
> - Not opposing MT

not being behind the mob.   not practising agro management.   PPing the mob
like a 2 $ whore, not knowing about/using hide+sneak should the situation
demand it

> SK:
> - ??

making 1 in the first place

> Shaman:
> - Not slowing melee mobs

not debuffing mobs.. not keeping track of buffs.. not slowing mobs

> Warrior:
> - Not taunting before breaking mezz

not keeping the mob out of the fucing wall!!! (raid pet peeve)
not having arrows to tag.  being slow to pick a target/react to pulls

> Wizzard:
> - Nuking before agro is established

nuking once then sitting down for the whole fight!

There are general roles too i think, which are equally as imortant, tho not
specific to just 1 class.

E.g..  pushing mobs - hi dont push it into a tree, up a wall, and when your
told to back off that means everybody

Agro management... it doesnt mean you have a bigger dick if you steal the
warriors agro.. if your not the tank, you shouldnt get agro, period

Leaving at bad times... you dont leave midpull.   You dont just gate on your
gd group..  you dont leave after the whole group wiped if u lived, help with
the c.r gdit
Slacking..  its not a charity.. pull your wait or get out the group
Not knowing at least the basics of assist, and mezzing/crowd control
Not knowing your own characters role
