I have:

AMD Athlon 1800+ XP
1 Gig DDR RAM
Soyo K7V Dragon+ motherboard
Creative Labs GeForce Annihilator 2 Pro (Soon to be upgraded to GeForce 
4 ti 4600 by Vision Tek
Sound Blaster Audigy MP3+

Running Windows XP Professional.

I have updated the sound drivers, video drivers, all the windows 
updates, including chip and motherboard updates from Windows Update, and 
ever EQ patch I can think of.

I start EQ, enter my station name and password and EQ crashes and exits 
to the desktop. I am about as frustrated and pissed as can be. I need 
help, someone please for the love of Innoruuk help me get this computer 
on EQ.

P.S. If no one can get this computer online, would anyone be interested 
in a 60 Dark Elf Necro, with half epic done, a prenerf circlet of 
shadows along with other high end no drop stuff., a 14 High Elf 
Enchanter with almost 250 jewelry skill making, and 36 Iksar Monk? BTW 
The Necro has close to 20k pp.

P.S.S. If anyone suggests buying an Intel or any other processor, you 
will be slapped silly by a stinky little monkey like demon. I've seen 
them...they are NOT as funny as you might imagine.

Thank you in advance for any help or ideas.
