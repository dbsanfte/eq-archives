There's a Loviepoo Snugglemuffin on EMarr.  I wouldn't petition her (if 
it *was* petitionable - not even sure of that much) because one of the 
first things I saw her doing was hosting a newbie contest for DEs and 
handing out plat rewards to the winners.  Great imagination, good player.  
And it *was* kind of a fun name for a DE warrior.. *g*  Anyway, point is, 
when I first saw her shouting out in Nek, the name irritated me, but as 
soon as I saw her play style, I had no problem with it.  People who play 
well will need to worry much less about a name change if the name isn't 
offensive or crude.
