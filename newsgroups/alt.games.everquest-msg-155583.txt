I've known some cocked-up patches before, but honestly...

Every time I've tried to load the game in the last three days I've had a
chunk of files to download, all sorts of patch news that I don't read 'cos
it's all about casters and some arcane skill called Manaburn which everyone
talks about between themselves but no-one'll explain to me (I feel like a
Windows user amongst Linux users whenever I ask someone)...  Then I get to
the logon screen and click on connect to be told 'Could not connect to the
EQ servers, please try again shortly'...

Is it me?

Oh, and before the usual flame war starts, I have NO PROBLEM with Verant, or
EQ, or patches in particular.  I see server downtime just as a motivation to
go out and do something else for a while, and I like the fact that the game
is still continually supported and shows no sign of being closed down.
