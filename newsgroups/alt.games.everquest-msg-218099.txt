Thats a thought, I've done something similar with my druid buddy
as my cleric; she'd kill her quad with me watching to heal as
needed or finish off stragglers, then she'd sit and med while I
killed my One mob, just standing to snare it for me.  It wasn't
better than her just soloing, but a LOT better than me soloing;
the similarity is that we pretty much just soloed while grouped. 
This was before the 20% hike to group exp, though... 

Two bards soloing while grouped for the extra 20% might work,
except that room to swarm would start getting a bit tight, as its
not just one kill, its a bunch in a row, and as you say, finding
two swarms worth of mobs in that close a range is going to be
tricky; if more mobs are available why wouldn't the one bard just
grab them all?

The two bard team can't really use the same plan as my
cleric/druid team, because the bard really never has to sit down
for long at all, unless he's lacking even a solstice earring for
mana regen; so its not a question of taking turns swarming, its
really a case of both having to swarm at once to really get the
"duo" effect.
