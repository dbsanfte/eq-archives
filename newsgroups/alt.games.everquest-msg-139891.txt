Tonight in /ooc in bazaar:

NewbDwfWar: Is anyone selling horses here?
Me: Yeah the stables.
NDW: How much is the cheapest one?
Me and a dozen others: Way more than you can afford.
(five minutes of silence)
NDW: Can somebody buy me the cheapest horse?

... *sigh*

Ryou
(10 minutes later that NDW was selling some fairly nice weapons, too.  
What is it with morons who beg for items then turn around and start 
selling stuff worth more than I've had in my entire EQ life 2 minutes 
later?)
