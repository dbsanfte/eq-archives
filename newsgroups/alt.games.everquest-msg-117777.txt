The name says it all really, you quest forever.  Whether that be goals you
set for yourself or following quests in the game.  There is no real aim to
the game, apart than to have fun.  You basically do what you want - there's
no you-have-defeated-the-big-nasty-end-of-level-cutscene at the end because
there is no end...  When you first start your goal may be to take revenge on
that orc pawn that killed you the second you walked from your city gates.
Later you set goals for yourself, that may be as simple to get to your next
spell level or as complex as your epic weapon and a full set of ToV
armour(1).

The main goal is to have fun, and for the most part, EQ is fun.  My god!  I
did a /played(2) the other day and almost fell off my chair - and that was
only my main character.

See you in Norrath,

Bah!

1.  ToV:  Temple of Veeshan - zone where the mobs (the things you kill) drop
items to complete uber (very nice and desireable to have ;) ) armour quests.

2. A command that tells you how much time in days, hours, seconds you have
been playing the character.
