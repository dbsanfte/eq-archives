    Unless you add some serious bonus to grouping, soloing will almost
always outpace a group. Almost all non-degenerate groups have at least one
member with little to no DPS, devoted to damage mitigation. Soloists have
techniques that eliminate the need for damage mitigation. Look at the
quadding wizard - he never gets hit. The necromancer casts one spell, Fear,
that negates the entire DPS of the target. The AoE group Stuns the mobs, so
they never deal damage. And so on.

    So druid, necromancer, and magician charms are NOT being changed? You
must be looking at a different issue than I am. By smacking charms, SOE is
smacking all three of those classes in PoP as well as enchanters.

    Not at all. Would you like to discuss how many people want to group
druids or necromancers in the post-60 game?

    And by then it's too late. Ask a monk how the whole "we'll revisit
damage mitigation" thing has gone. You've played this game for long enough,
you should know better.
