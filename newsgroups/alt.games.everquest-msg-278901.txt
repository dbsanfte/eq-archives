I have had no trouble soloing thus far in EQ2. Admittidly I am not to the
higher levels as yet (25 Erudite Necromancer), and we shall see as I
approach them.

Never had trouble getting a group to kill the Orc either, all you have to do
is keep an eye on /OOC, someone will be asking for help with the orc, bam
instant group.

If you dont like the way EQ2 works and think WoW is a better game then go
back to it and quit whining.
