}No it doesn't.  "Fagot", however, does.  You might want to be careful how 
}you spell that, should you try to walk that line.

It's worthy of note, also, that the bundles of sticks in question were 
frequently stacked about the feet of a sodomite in preparation for setting 
him ablaze.

Fancy people objecting to being labelled with a term that could be 
interpreted as a threat on their life.  People can be so oversensitive, can't 
they?
