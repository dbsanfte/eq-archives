nonono
Mez him, tash, slow, debuff, root, ToT, Wandering mind, Scryers trespass,
rune yourself up, Dot him, let him  hit you to get pet  agro, chain color
stun, or whirl/ddd/lll if you are in a bad mood. (did that to a friend in a
duel.. she stopped responding for about 5 min. Seems she threw up on her
keyboard. One of those 3d game motion sickness people.)
Blind is handy too.

but to answer the OP intended question: find an animal. generally want a
blue. Snare, panic animal, open up Can o' Whoop Ass. (Not this one
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=3615 just beat em down in
your preferred style)
