I did that for the first time last night, met a language interested 
erudite, so we traded the languages we could then sat and "bounced" 
languages at each other to get increases.

The method is simple. Lets say i have 1 skill in froglog, and he dont 
have any. Then i can teach him up to 2 skill.
Then we zone, and he can teach me up to 3 skill. Zone again ...... 
around a hour and a half later we were both masters in Froglok.

Unfortunately its only a few people that wanna spend their time learning 
languages, so if you find one that wanna spend time "bouncing" with you, 
be sure to get his name, so you can do it again another time.

I only miss 9 more languages now, guess a few others will come with 
Luclin, at least Val Shir. Also hope my knowledge of the Combine 
language will help me up there.
