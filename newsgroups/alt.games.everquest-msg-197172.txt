Of course, this completely ignores the fact that by level 65, with a bit of
raiding, both the 100 stamina wood elf and the 150 stamina ogre will be in
gear that gets them to max stamina when buffed.   Its a slight advantage to
the ogre, since he will get there first, with a few less items, but nothing
that can't be overcome pretty easily.

The truely obscene advantage of the ogre is the "cannot be stunned from the
front" ability.   Which the wood elf (or any other race) will never get, no
matter what they are wearing.
