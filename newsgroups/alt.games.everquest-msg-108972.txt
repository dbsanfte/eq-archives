I bought the Prima guide before I started Everquest... my only advice to
somebody who reads it before they play, try to FORGET EVERYTHING you read in
the book.

It has some HUGE mistakes that will *ruin* your class... Hi, SK's need WIS?
Don't make me laugh.

According to the book Wizards get summon corpse... and high level necros
stand chilling while their pet single handedly kills enemy guards at zones
like felwithe (LOL yeah right!)

We had a thread on the Prexus messageboards before, about just how many
errors that book had.. it trully is a piece of crap
