Yeah, running all the way from the next zone (FM) is a chore!

Merchants with about the worst prices in the game.  Remember, we are
evil, and Verant interprets that as "should be gratuitously screwed",
so our outpost in Kunark overcharges and underpays.  Compare to the
outpost in FV, where the good people get reasonable prices.

>4) guards at outpost who will help with overpulls, or trains

Even better...the guards don't have their guard flag set, which means
they follow the normal mob rules for kill credit.  If a guard jumps into
your fight, you still have a chance of getting XP for the kill!
