 It would be nice if Avatar added 100 to STA too! Although I've already
maxxed STA so it doesn't matter much to me but it would make things a
little easier.

 As for dex, I haven't done any parsing but when Avatar finally gets
around to proccing, I start proccing more often. Unbuffed I think my dex
is around 175.
