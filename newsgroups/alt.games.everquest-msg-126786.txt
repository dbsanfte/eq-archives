There's also the idea that God dealt with the Isrealites like one would deal
with a growing child.  Many strict rules, at first, that may seem arbitrary.
As the child grows, more theory, and more freedom.  Eventually, you have an
adult, capable of making good decisions based on concepts he learned from
early childhood onward.  The parallel is, that the old laws were written to
teach the Jews, the laws of Moses were a "distillation" of the old laws, put
in concrete form (the Jews were just freed from slavery, it's not as if they
were ready to just be set on their own).  The new testament, OTOH, is more
theory, as one would teach a young teenager.  That's why the laws changed,
not because God changed, but because the Jews were ready for more general
forms of the law.
