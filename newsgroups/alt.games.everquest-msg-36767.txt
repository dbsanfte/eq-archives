	And if you'd went back the second week, you'd have found only yourself in
the zone.  The "pharming" issue is a canard, the problem is simply not
prevalent enough to require such extreme countermeasures.

	It is, or should be, a prerogative of level to be able to go obtain minor
items yourself instead of having to rely on others to do it for you.  You
already went through that, after all.

	How about fixing the damn bugs, so that one screwup in a dungeon doesn't
result in fifty mobs casting through the walls (or just running through them)
to kill you?

	How about NOT putting items level 50 characters will want in level 30
dungeons?  You want to bleat about "level appropriate content", well, the
content ain't level appropriate!

|The Trivial Loot Code just allows VI to use that method without
|knowing that higher-levels will simply move in.

	The higher-levels will move in ANYWAY.  I got to watch a high-50s Warrior
and Mage or Wizard (/anon, couldn't be sure from the spells) kill every dog in
the Warrens.  I got to watch a 34 Druid show up like clockwork to solo the
Muglwump.

	There can't be a better reason not to use a thing than IT DOESN'T WORK.

|Just to be clear:  we're not talking about quest items, just normal
|loot.   

	Since the TCC blocks quest items we ARE talking about them.

|As far as I'm concerned, it should be applied across the
|board.   So what if that 56th druid I saw quad-kiting kodiaks in WC
|can't get her own bear pelts?   It's a good way to encourage a
|player economy that has some flow from lower-levels to the
|higher-levels, instead of being almost always the other way.

	Rather, it's a good way to piss off your most dedicated customers for no
real benefit.
