That's possible, but I think, unlikely.  I do "/who" regularly.
I would welcome any "real" statistical data.  I think the burden
of proof lies on the OP.

I'm a "porcupine" druid, myself, though I'm not sure how long that

Was he twinked?

I played a mage to 30 and didn't find it THAT easy.  I killed some
yellows and reds but it was pretty risky.  The lack of crowd control
left me running for zone a lot -- the last thing a mage wants to do
is zone, since she loses her pet.  It costs a LOT of mana -- and thus,
takes a lot of time -- to summon a new pet, equip ment, buff them,
and then med to full again.
