Just wanted to add my 2c...

personally... I don't think there's anyone who don't know it happened... I
don't know alot of ppl who ain't affected by it.. I don't have any friends
who died... don't know anyone who does... but being a Marine, my life is
still being affected by it and will for a long time to come...

I think about what happened everytime I hear about my fellow troops in
Afgan... I think about it everytime I hear Bush talk about going after
Sadam. I think about it during the memorial service we had today.

The last thing I want personally... is someone ranting and raving because
the way the 'feel' things should happen isn't happening... you ain't
respecting anyone but getting on a newsgroup and crying behind a
newsreader... just because you thing that everyone and there brother should
be reminded don't mean that those ppl who are logging on to FORGET need to
hear about it... everyone greaves in their own way so GET OFF THEIR BACK...

And what about the non americans who don't care? or who don't like america?
Why should thier gaming experience be invaded by our tragedy? Mourning is
good. Needed. but not at the expense of walking over some one elses game.

Why don't you do something like create a chat channel where you can discuss
the events of that day? Why don't you post a memorial of the friends you had
who used to be everquest players? why don't you Honor their memory instead
of bitching about it....

/em takes a deep breath

Sorry... but I for one believe that Honor is not gotten by crying because
what you thing should be done isn't done... grow up... or atleast don't post
that trash on this board

I for one think that Verant has done good by being quiet. A wise man once
said: It is better for you to be quiet and let the world wonder how stupid
you are, than to open your mouth and remove all doubt.
