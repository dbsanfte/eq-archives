I have a 48 wizard, 52 druid, 57 enc.  I think my wizard is asked for TL
(but not ports...there aren't many places a 50+ wizard can't TL but can
port) a lot more often than my druid.  None of my characters really ever go
/role, so that's not a factor.

I took over payments on a 49 shaman but I rarely play him.  He's asked about
as often as my druid for SoW but you're right, he doesn't seem to be asked
for other buffs by strangers very often.  Probably because anyone who has
ever grouped with a shaman knows that they're terminally OOM and asking for
buffs is likely to be REALLY putting the shaman out.
