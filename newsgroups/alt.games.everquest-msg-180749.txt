considering it's download only, considering that there isn't any major
graphic update, you should be able to, but setting everything to minimal
systemrequirements (nno social anims, no lucling graphics etc etc.) should
make luclin work. But considering you are already doubting that, i would not
suggest investing in loy 1st but in some new equipment. gforce3 videocard
decent processor and ram. You'll enjoy it for much than only eq, and those
items can be bought 2nd hand these days already. And then it's time to order
loy/pop and luclin.
