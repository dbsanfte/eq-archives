Diary of a fire beetle  (the beetle strikes back)


Dear Diary,
                 Today I looted a burned out lightstone, I never
imagined this
single item would lead me on an epic quest fraught with dangers and
powerful
enemies, which was lucky, because it didn't. Wandered over to Freeport
to visit
my mother (she insisted), turns out she is dating a klicknick worker
called
"Barry". Overheard an argument about a bread quest as well. My hatred
for
newbies grows.
Newbs killed by : 1002 (very busy in freeport)
Newbs killed: 4

Dear diary,
                I feel terrible. We had a party last night, got very
drunk and
Barry drunkenly told me he was my real father!! As if! A klicknik
worker, I
dont think so. Im leaving freeport and returning home to qeynos. I hate
it
here, sometimes I think the newbies want to call a truce, they say "Hail
a fire
beetle" and I turn around all excited only to find they have
accidentally
targeted me rather than the passing higher level player they're begging
from.
"Hail a fire beetles corpse" just snaps it off.
Newbs killed by : 110 (I sulked far away by the zone)
Newbs killed: 25 (In my anger I would shout "Klickniks suck the sweat
from dead
newbs balls" and when they chased me I trained the naked newbies)
