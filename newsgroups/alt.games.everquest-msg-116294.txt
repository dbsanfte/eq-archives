All,

	I have visited the Everquest site and would love to try it
out.  My laptop is great for browsing the web and everything else, but
I feel for games it's not quite that powerful.

	I would like to install Everquest and try it out but given the
requirements I'm wondering if it would run on my system in a limited
capability?  I'm not worried about flashy graphics as long as it will
provide me with a pretty decent display.  My setup is:

	Gateway Solo 3150
	CPU: Intel 466Mhz Celeron
	Memory: 160mb
	Graphics Chip: NeoMagic MagicMedia256AV (2.5mb RAM)
	   (runs at 800x600; true color)
	Audio: NeoMagic MagicMedia256AV (SB compatible)

	I have a broadband cable connection and plenty of hard drive
space (16.8mb free).

	Like I said, for cruising the web it's great, but I'd like to
know if the software will at least run with this or if anyone else out
there is running it in a limited capacity.  Also, does the software
detect your hardware and refuse to install if it doesn't meet
requirements?

	I've tried the tech support but they won't say whether it will
at least run or not. (can't really blame 'em)

	Thanks for any tips or help out there!

	If not, I guess there's always text-based MUD's... :>
