Hypothetically this is the best expansion for a solo player yet.

The Task system is designed to give a solo player relatively short jobs 
to do and reward him for completing them.

In addition, like POP and ROK before that, this expansion adds more 
levels to the game, this time taking you up to 70th.

I've seen reports that there are zones to play in from 45 up to 70, 
while perhaps that means in a full group, surely if a group can kill and 
do well in a zone at 45, then a good solo artist can do as well at 50.

While thats not a -lot- to offer, its a damn site more than LDoN, where 
you had to corral at least 2 other people to join you to start a 
mission, or GOD where you had to be, well, a God, in order to do much of 
anything solo.

But the expansion before that was LOY.  Thats a bunch of nice soloable 
zones, what made you stay away from that one?  This one should be 
better, because its go the tasks and the levels... but thats not to say 
LOY wasn't good for soloers.
