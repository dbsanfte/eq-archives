Well, if you had a programmable keypad on that box (not advocating this, 
just saying is all) you could fire up a Bard and figure three good songs to 
twist. That way you have mana regen, ATK buff, snare, whatever, and if the 
keypad is doing the twisting it's a set-and-forget thing... Plus, with 
Selos and PoK who needs ports? :D

That said, without a programmable keypad I would go with a Druid also. My 
second choice for that combo would be a mage, as you are going to end up 
very low on the DPS side of things and a mage pet can be sic-and-forget.
