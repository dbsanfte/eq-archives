For those of you who haven't been near any source of info, the US has been
attacked in various locations today. I'm not going to go into the details
here.
I do have 2 requests,
1) Please think of the loved ones and say what ever prayers you may. There
are still people in the buildings fighting to survive.
2) Put up your flags. Don't let these terrorists get the satisfaction of
knowing they have broken the spirit of the American people. They may have
won round one and they may have changed how we think about our own safety,
but we will not be broken.

Respectfully and sadly and humbly...
