I love you, too.

Perhaps you would be more persuasive if you argued
against the point I made rather than making something
up and pretending that's the point I made.  I didn't
say the wedding party were terrorists.  I said that
the terrorists hid behind the wedding party.  Hiding
behind civilians, using them as human shields, is
a common tactic of the people who you defend so
vigorously.

In fact, while my military does screw up, it does a
very good job in the overwhelming majority of instances.
The crews of our gunships are highly trained, 
very professional, and not given to thoughtless action.
If such a crew member says that they were receiving
incoming fire, then I give that significant weight.

Should the event be investigated?  Sure.  Could an
error have been made?  Sure -- but even then it is
almost *certainly* an error, and not, as pro-terrorist
apologists jump to claim, an intentional act of killing
civilians.  The crew claims that large caliber anti-aircraft
fire was incoming.  A large cache of weapons was found
nearby, including anti-aircraft weapons.  My inclination
is to believe the crew.  Your inclination is to assume
that the crew just decided to shoot a bunch of civilians
for the hell of it.  That's your right, but it's pretty
wacky.

If, in fact, there was not incoming fire, then training
should be modified.  An effort should be made to distinguish
between hostile and non-hostile fire. However, in spite of your strong
desire to make America the bad guy, it is simply not a good idea to
stand in a theater of battle and shoot at a gunship, even if you are
doing it in celebration.  I don't know if you have ever stood
perimeter, but let me tell you this.  If you are in Indian Country, a
bullet whips by your head and you see a stranger with a rifle pointed
at you, your first reaction is not to ask "Hey, be careful with that
thing."

If it is, you will not have a second reaction -- you will 
be dead.  No.  A stranger with a rifle on a battlefield
who is shooting in your direction is called a target.

Perhaps, just for a little while, it would be appropriate
for a wedding party in an area of engagement to restrain
from shooting in the direction of combatants.  Personally,
I don't think that's such a horrible thing to suggest.
