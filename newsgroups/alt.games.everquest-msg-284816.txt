Take a look at the list of servers marked as Up and Down on this page:

http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/network_status.vm

and tell me whether Combine is Up or Down.  No?  How about Sleeper?

OK< the page itself is, as I've said many times, uninformative, since 
the servers are frequently up but closed to all but GM's running around 
doing some cursory testing.

However, its a slap in the face that they dont even bother to misinform 
us progression server players!
