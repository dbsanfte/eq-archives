I can see a good (+) or bad (-) side to each of these, but I can also take
the bad side and turn it into good.

> - addictive personality.
(+) This just means you'll do better at EQ.  You'll be more likely to spend
longer times with it, and also with the (long ago) implimtation of /gems you
don't have as much down time either.
(-) First find a good lawyer.  Let EQ ruin your life (refuse to seek
professional help...quit your job, totally mess yourself up).  Then remember
how great the american justice system is, let yourself and the lawyer cash
in on it, and get in national (possibly) news at the same time.

> - heavy study committments.
(+) Play an Ogre Warrior & solo.  Studying will give you something to do
while you're healing.
(-) You don't need to study.  Remember that if you study EQ well enough, and
eventually become a guide, you can use this as customer service experience
on your resume (even though it is volunteer work...I don't see a problem in
it).  If you are a good enough guide, you may eventually consider applying
to become a GM (this will mean re-location unless you already happen to live
in the right area).

> - marriage/partner problem.
(+) As said by Verant. "A family that slays togeather stays togeather." (and
I don't think...well, hopefully anyway...that they're referring to serial
killers either).  If you really don't like her you can always get her to
play PVP server with you.  Also if she starts being annoying /ignore her.
(-) Maybe it's time she goes anyway.  Remember here in america you can walk
into the marrage with nothing, get a good lawyer, and possibly walk out with
half or more of everything (had a friend this happened to).  Also a good
place to dump half your debt (assuming you aquire it durring the marriage).
But also maybe EQ could help out here.  Role play with your personal lives.
She can walk around the house and be dressed as the female wood elf looking
for her corpse (who never finds it either). =)
(-/+) She can be something you can do durring down time. =) I'd not
recommend this durring actual battles or while in a group though. This could
be bad for those around you. All she'd have to do is strattle your lap & let
you look over her shoulder, that way you can do her & EQ at the same time.

> - weight problem.
(+) You're over weight...playing EQ can prevent you from having time to eat,
or (like myself) you just might forget to eat for about 24-36 (or on the
rare ocasion 48) hours.  If you're under weight...EQ can prevent you from
having a chance to eat healthy meals, allowing you to stock up on junk food.
(-) If you're refering to weight problem as in lifting weights, then EQ
can't help much there...but investing in a larger monitor can help durring
down time (I'm pretty sure a 19" weighs about 45+ pounds).  Or see above
refference to doing your partner & EQ at the same time...that can be good
excersize as well.

> - unstable ISP.
(+) Good reason to get a new ISP.
(-) If in "ISP" you're meaning "Intimate Sexual Partner" then an unstable
one could cause problems.  If by unstable you mean mentally unstable, then
definately time to get a new one.  If by unstable you mean in ballance, she
can always kneel down for oral instead.
