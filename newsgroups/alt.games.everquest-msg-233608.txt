The funny part for me was, I first went to this link last night while 
watching Futurama.  Which was set in a penguin reserve on Pluto, where the 
penguins had just started reproducing too fast and overpopulating their 
niche, necessitating their slaughter with sawed-off shotguns to make juicy 
penguin tempura.

So the game seemed very situationally appropriate.  593.5, btw. :)
