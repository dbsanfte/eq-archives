Arrrrgghhh!  Why you low-down, no-good, gnoll-loving gnome reject!  I
curse you to only grouping with people who think assist the tank means
get on the mob he's not on!

The funny thing is that you did get a rise out of me, I had a whole
bunch of nastiness ready to send.  Glad I read the rest of your post.
I don't see why you can't ask the bard to stop, or do a quick 3-song
twist to rebuff.  Bards know (or should know) what they need to do
during buffing.  Hell, I even know people who are afraid to put a bard
with the feign-pull group, but I never seem to have any trouble with
it.  I thought the reason we were so useful against dispelling mobs is
that we can use our uber-buffs to replace those that get dispelled.
