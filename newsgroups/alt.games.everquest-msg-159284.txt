As far as I understand it all the dot's now stack with one another, even
same lines and it seems to me to be true for example when fighting hornets
in burning wood who have high fire restance I threw stinging swarm, creeping
crud and drones of doom at them and their health points plummeted now i am
not positive that creeping crud is exactly the same line but it has the same
msg (target is engulfed by a swarm) so I assume it is.
