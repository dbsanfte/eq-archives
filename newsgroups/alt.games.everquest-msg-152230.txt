}Does the rule about grammar corrections apply to algebraic corrections as
}well?

Apparently so, since as Kaev pointed out, It's parentheses and not 
perintheses.  My bad. :)

}Well, way back when, when I learned Algebra, we were not particularly
}encouraged to over parenthesize.  We were encouraged to learn operator
}precedance.  This was back before I started using computers.  And, last time
}I checked (X*Y)/(X*Z) = Y/Z which would be incorrect.

Yep, you're right, I hosed the distributive law but good.  Good thing my 
math degree was printed on extremely valuable paper. :)

}Ideally I would have represented it as
}
}Y
}-- + W
}Z
}
}which is closer to what it would have looked like on paper, and does not
}suffer from the same ambiguity.

Yup, the '--' acts as a substitute for a pair of parentheses.  But it's an 
inconvenient way to write formulae in text.  It's also inconvenient when 
you're grading papers by students with crummy handwriting, who write 
things like:
      
       Y    -  
        ----  
     ---     + W
   --    Z

Luckily, students wth such hadwriting have usually gone awry earlier in 
the problem so I can just ut a big '0' on it and move on. (In fairness, I 
should acknowledge at this point that my handwriting is damn near 
illegible.  So I usually stick to parentheses. :) )

}Next time I will consider adding in the extra parenthises to reduce
}confusion.
}Perhaps, had I continued my math studies beyond where I stopped, I would
}have gotten to the point where the rules of precedence changed and the
}operators had different meanings.  However, we were discussing basic algebra
}here.  I will go so far as to admit that it is possible to misinterpret what
}I put forward, due to the limitations of putting the formula in ASCII text.

Righto.  The real issue, though, is that relying on rules of precedence is 
counting on your audience having more clue than using parentheses does.  
And given the degree of innumeracy of the average human, that's not such a 
good plan.  Especially when even the presumably numerate can hose things 
up pretty thoroughly sometimes. :)
