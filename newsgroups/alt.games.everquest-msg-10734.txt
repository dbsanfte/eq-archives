The fair game play rules state that you can not deny a player a camp.  He asked
and told you what he wanted, and you said no.  If it were me I would of been
willing to sit and wait for the mob to pop you kill it and I loot it.  You
refused that option, he it need to do a quest, I would of done the same thing.

"A strong body makes the mind strong. As to the species of exercises, I advise
the gun. While this gives moderate exercise to the body, it gives boldness,
enterprise and independence to the mind. Games played with the ball, and others
of that nature, are too violent for the body and stamp no character on the mind.
Let your gun therefore be your constant companion of your walks."
