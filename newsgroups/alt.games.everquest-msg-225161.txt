From the shadows, the mysterious Lance Berg <emporer@dejazzd.com> (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

You'll see the reverse soon enough. LDoN *regular* exp sucks when tier
2 and 3 plane experience rolls right in like water, to say nothing of
higher.

I know I sure felt like I was getting good use of my time when after
another boring LDoN mission I had a whopping 1.5 blue more after the
pain of putting together a group willing to stay long enough to do an
ldon, getting the mission, running there, doing it, and the screw
around afterwards.

I'd say for regular exp in the 50s onwards PoP tier 2 and up (not
including PoV and PoS trash mobs) is about three times better than
LDoN.
