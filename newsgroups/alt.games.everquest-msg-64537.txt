A List of the problems:

1) 1 Comp (my wife's) patched and entered the game just fine, even without
SOL, the changes are VERY noticeable.  However I was unable to login to the
patch server recieving a message that I am either out of disk space, OR  do
not have permission to read the files, and so on... (7.6 GB free on my
system)

2) I copied the files from her hard-drive to my own and fired up the
EVERQUEST.EXE.  No files, required, I was in.

3) We dropped back out, to try to make sure she could get in, and boom...
she locked, me in

FIXES

1) *arrgh* wait on EQ and get a good patch, or copy the files from a friend

2) WORKED

3) I have no idea but it looks like we are both in.
