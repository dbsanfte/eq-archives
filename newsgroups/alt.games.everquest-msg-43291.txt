Win XP will be a gaming OS though.  At least, it will have no choice but to
be.  There will be no more Win 95/98/98se/ME line of crap, finally.

Windows 2000 works *very* well as a gaming OS too, so long as the driver
writers know what they're doing.  Now that there won't be an alternative, the
driver writers will be forced to get it right with XP.  I for one am ecstatic
about this.

IMHO, there never should have been a ME.  It just confused the hell out of
everyone and was wholly unnecessary.  (Microsoft marketing brainiac: 'Let's
name the Windows NT upgrade "Windows 2000" and the Windows 98 upgrade "Windows
ME" for "Millenium Edition"... who could *possibly* be confused by this?'
