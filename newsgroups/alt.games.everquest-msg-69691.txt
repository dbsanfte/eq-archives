XP comes with DirectX 8.1 built in friend...

As a rule of thumb since operating systems were introduced to home computers
I have never been one to jump right away to a new OS. Well I have to take
part of that back, I did go to 95 right away because it was SO different
then Win3.11. ME, XP etc are just beefed up 98 really. XP is more networking
friendly like NT etc. This could be discussed/argued further but I wish not
to. Done benchmarks with identical systems with 98 and XP and came up the
same. We saw no speed increase with XP. Comparing the same systems with 98 &
DX8.0a vs XP & DX8.1 we saw these differences: D3D is faster and more
compatable on the 98 system, OpenGL (note OpenGL does not utilize DX
obviously) seemed the same on both. Note: the graphics card was a GeForce 3
Ti-500 with drivers 2311 98/ME version on the 98 and the XP drivers on the
XP.

Now another observation about DX8.1 is how it handles D3D. Notice how OpenGL
works just fine with DX8.1? I've twinked and twinked my registry, video
card, DX etc for D3D and still couldn't get it right, hence the reason I
went back to 8.0a.

Wish you luck.. :)
also read my post in the previous thread "Small Freezes" about DX, Nvidia,
X-Box etc...
