I do not particularily like my job, but I have no intention of finding a new
one as the money is good. A responsible adult doesn't just decide to change
jobs because they don't *like* it, many more factors come into play. I will
put up with considerable bullshit for one reason mainly: money.

Err - and your second comment strikes me as being rather simplistic to the
point of being intellectually challenged even. If I did not like EQ I would
not be playing EQ and posting to an EQ newsgroup. I like EQ, that happens to
be why I am paying money to play it - have we ascertained that bit yet?
Now - that has nothing whatsoever to do with the fact I would tolerate
absolutely zero bullshit off a VI/SOE customer service rep? Only one thing
does, yes: money.

Economics is to society what gravity is to nature, it is what ensures that
all the shit rolls downhill. If you want to see which way is down you just
drop the apple or greenback and see which direction it goes in. That is also
the correct direction for the shit to be travelling in.

Once you see apples falling up into the stratosphere and people paying to be
shat on you can rest assured it is only a matter of time before the crack
wears off and reality will once again reassert itself...
