There is a pretty good map of the place at EQ'Lizer. Go with a group, cause
the safest assumption is that you could spend a week there solid (24/7, no
sleeping) and never find a pickup group.

45 would be good up through the pool room...past that, and the mobs toughen
up quite a bit. Fortunately, the guardian armor drops on things reachable
at your level.

The things that people 55+ hunt are rather deep inside...theres no way you
will stumble on them accidently. The zone is enourmous. About the same land
area as the east wastes.
