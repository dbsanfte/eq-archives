I'm thinking that you may have the perfect dungeoneering group there
already.  You have can invis in to where you want to start, FD pull to
clear spawn, and root/dot the adds to clear rooms.  You just have to
like killing undead or summoned.  
It also depends on how you define dungeoneering.  If it's sneaking in
to camp a back area, then this duo rocks.  If it's start at the front
and come out at the back, then no duo is going to be able to do it.
