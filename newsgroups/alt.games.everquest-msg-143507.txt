People keep saying this.  Having been in a Kunark / Epic fight level guild
for a lot of raiding, I can tell you it's just not true.   At least on our
server, Trak is every bit as camped and raced to as Sev is,  (perhaps more)
and your guild would have to get several Traks before you could even begin
to fight Hoshkar.  (or whatever his name is).

If you're going for Sev himself, you only have to get one of him.  Seems
like your time would be better spent camping him once than camping 5 or 10
separate Trak spawns, (not to mention the rest of the keys... x 30).
