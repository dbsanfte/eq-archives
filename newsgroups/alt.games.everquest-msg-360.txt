OK, sorry to drop this on the newsgroup, but it has been three weeks
of email sending and petitioning and I have yet to recieve an
answer....

Anytime I try to zone, the computer hangs and then freezes.  No
changes in software, or connection, and it came out of no where.  Has
anyone else had this prob, because it's driving me insane.  I haven't
been able to zone in three weeks and I haven't had an answer yet to
emails or petitions to help me, and I'm getting rather upset,
understandably.
