Genesis 2:16&17 (from the New International Version, for those that
care):

"And the Lord God commanded the man, 'You are free to eat from any
tree in the garden; but you must not eat from the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat of it you will surely
die'."

I think your interpretation of what god meant are probably true, but
he still lied to Adam.  Or at least have deliberately misleading
information.
