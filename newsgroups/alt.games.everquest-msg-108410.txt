Clerics have regular fears as well as a couple lame undead only fears.. which
hardly ever get used.  Undead are affected by regular fear, and the slight
mana savings in using the undead only fear has to be counterbalanced
against the much larger flexibility of a real fear.

Yes, its an aside, but I had to object to the logic of "if you're pulling
undead"

Now what a cleric -can- do better against undead is nuke... more efficient and
faster cycling than the cleric's regular nuke line.  Oh, and Sense Undead
(rarely
used) and Invis to Undead, and there is an undead DOT line, although only the
post 50 ones are more efficient than a comperable nuke.
