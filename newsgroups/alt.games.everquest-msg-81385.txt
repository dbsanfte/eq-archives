Trade Skills give me a head ache.
Seperate components, place in container, kiln, furnace, whatever, combine.
I'd like a auto trade-skill funtion. Starting working on making metal bits,
for example,
and your char will continue to attempt to make them, seperating all
components automatically,
until you run out of the necessary ingredients and have to buy more.
Sure, this would remove the effort and therefore acheivement factor, but the
only thing you can
be proud of achieving is a stubborn persistance to perform the mundane. I
have enough of that in RL.
It not as though it depends on player skill, such as the way reaching a
certain area in Tomb Raider
required dexterity and adroitness of fingers with the gamepad.
For me trade skills are simply not fun, which is not what the game should
have been about.
I could spends days and weeks grinding through tailoring, to be able to make
Tailored backpacks,
so that I can make them and sell at a 100pp a go. Or I can kill wooly
mammoths in Everforst and make that money in an hour. True, once you have
the skill you can quickly make pp, in seconds, but only if you dont fail.
And ofcourse you still have get the pelts which don't drop oftion, unless
lots a newbies are playing, or you want to grind yourself by farming.
I just wish the trade skill part was not so boring.
