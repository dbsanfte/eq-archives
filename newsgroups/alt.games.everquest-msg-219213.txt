Having "enough hitpoints" is merely a constraint on winning each fight, 
it has little to do with optimizing your kills per hour.

Unless of course by having enough hitpoints, you mean enough incoming 
heals, which means enough mana regen to fuel them, which means having 
enough time to regen mana... in which case you essentially agree with 
Berg. HP regen is correlates to mana regen, but absolute hit points just 
allows you to survive higher burst damage, and though in the case of 
cheal, it can increases its mana efficiency.
