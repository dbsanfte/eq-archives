I eyeballed that comment as well, but wasn't going to say anything.  I
figured maybe my husband was a freak of a shaman.  For him there was no
"downtime".  He had this stack of timer things in his UI that kept track
of when haste, stat buffs, HoS, regen, and resists were going to expire,
to the second.  That way not a single buff ever dropped. Well, except for
the ones I was in charge of (sow and cold resist...we tended to fight a
lot of diverse casters).  His UI scared me.

That was just the buffing. He did healing, slowing, epic-dotting, and
pulling/rooting as well.  Just don't try to talk to him in the middle of
this.  Think "as many clicks per second as a bard" and you can imagine
what he'd have to say if you became chatty.
