There's a whole Team to write two sentences?

And a separate team to write four sentences?

And the first team can't include all the information the second team did?

I can write 8 sentences complaining about this state of affairs in under 
two minutes, and I'm working on my own and not on the clock.

Its ridiculous, and your attempts to hand wave it away with a Voltair 
reference aren't effective.

You know I'm right, I know I'm right.  We both know nothing is going to 
be done about it, but that doesn't make this sad state of affairs any 
more palatable.

The minimal effort that would be required to do this right, compared to 
the larger (still minimal, but larger) effort required to get it wrong 
in the current way... it just gets under my skin, like nails on a 
chalkboard.  Sure, its trivial, but its very triviality makes it all the 
worse.
