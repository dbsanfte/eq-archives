alternately certain zones [all cities, newbie starting zones like 
freeports west and east, GFay, butchersblock, misty, steamfont, FoB, 
LoIO, innothule, Feerot, QHills, toxx, and shadeweavers] can be tweaked 
so that if you are under whatever the PK level is [10th? it has been a 
while since i played on a zek] you cannot be targeted or AEd by a player 
character, and if you are above the PK level, the mobs in the newbie 
zone cannot be targeted at all...providing a chance to start and get at 
least something above basic issue stuff. And all the original newbie 
quest ingredients drop in that newbie zone.

coddling the players? yup. but it beats being ganked immediately. those 
zones have an unfair advantage to existing characters who go the grief 
route.
