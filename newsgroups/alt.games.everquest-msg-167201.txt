One thing I would like to point out in my post that's caused people to
have hissy fits for some reason: The word "technically". By strictest
definition, soloing implies that you're hunting with zero outside
assistance. So, by strict definition, you're only soloing if you have
no buffs cast by others and only use equipment you've gained through
your own hunting...

Everyone's itching to jump on me over anything I say, though, so they
couldn't/wouldn't grasp that I was trying to be a smartass...
