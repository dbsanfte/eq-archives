 Ehhh.. I can pretty much spawn the AC anytime I want. 46 AC kills, JBoots
for most of my chars and lots and lots of MQ sales ( I financed a Leather
Bridle Horse with JBoot MQs when Luclin came out) later I quit out of 
boredom of it. Now there are much more lucrative persuits for me to make
plat at my level.
 
 There is sort of a trick to it actually.
