Ummmm...I never said it might come from there.  In the release by Verant
they were stating that they regularly check for viruses and if you were
infected it must have come from an outside source.  I wouldn't blame this on
them, but I'm sure if they got to the point where they made that type of
statement someone must have pounded on their door screaming it's their
fault.
Viruses?  They happen.  Accuse Verant of intentionally putting one on their
product?  Yeah right...there's good business practice for them, right?

I hope you got all that coffee up off your keyboard, but you missed your
chin.  I'm used to seeing your asinine comments though so it doesn't bother
me.  I'm just posting this so others can see what a donkey you truly are.
Making others words into something else simply because you can't understand
them reading them yourself.

Please go back to reading Dr. Seuss until you grow up.
