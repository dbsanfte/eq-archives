It's been on the live forums every time, virtually 99% correct, for the
past 24 months.  They usually update if the patch is over running, and when
the servers are up, and any issues, in the little panel Zat has setup.

Lance refuses to read the forums and refuses to help himself, and instead
insists on using a resource we all know is inaccurate.

And then moaning, every, single, time.
