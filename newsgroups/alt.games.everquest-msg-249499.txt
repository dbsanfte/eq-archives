When the mobs are mixed yellow and dark blue? :) I think that is the 
appropriate level.

I disagree. I 3 man LDoNs all the time with a frien and my 2nd box alt. 
I did Guk last night with my 32nd SK alt, my 32nd Clr alt 2nd box, and a 
32nd monk... we finished with nearly 30 minutes to spare and went in 
with only the 32nd clr's buffs. My sk is wearing darkforge armor, the 
monk was wearing wu's, the clerics still in his newbie armour with his 
summoned hammer... these aren't twinks by any stretch.

I'll grant you can't go solo, but honestly, there is not *that* much 
that you can do that's 'level approrpiate' solo that also results in 
worthwhile drops. I find your assertion to the contrary perplexing... I 
find it tough to find drops i want that don't require a raid =)

That's only true in that very limited problem scope. If you do 1400 
points in 'your' camp, *and* 1400 points in 'his' camp you can each get 
2 1400 point items from, either 1 from each camp, or the same camp 
twice. Surely there are 2 items you'd each like? And once 'they' have 
1400 points in EF there is no reason for them not to go elsewhere with 
you... they've unlocked everything in EF... it doesn't matter where they 
go to get more points...although not all of them know that.

Its even harder to get them into <insert almost any non-ldon zone except 
for a few planar camps>. From Kael to the Grey to Griegs to Sebilis to 
NToV ... if you want the interesting drops from places like that ... 
make very good friends.

Whereas I look at it as working towards a 2nd item... which you can now 
purchase from the selection of the two camps combined! Sure you put in 
twice the time, but you walked out with twice the reward... that is only 
true in LDoN... you get 6 guys who want 6 different non-ldon drops, and 
odds are pretty good you will do 6 very long boring camps and walk away 
with 1 item each, 2 if your very lucky. If those same 6 guys perversely 
wanted an item from each ldon theme... and you put the same amount of 
time in LDoN, then each guy walks away with his desiered item, and 
enough points to get 5 more of equivalent value... that's a *huge* 
improvement.

It sounds like you are really mostly bitter that you can't solo ldons. 
Which is a valid complaint in my opinion... to a point.

That you can't spend the points where you would like is on par with 
complaining that you can only get groups in PC but you want drops from 
Befallen. You'd just go to befallen yourself if you could, but that's 
not allowed in ldon so your upset about the points, when you should be 
upset they don't have ldons scaled back in difficulty or with extended 
timers or something that both allow you to solo and make success a 
possibility. Does that hit near the mark... or am i way off?
