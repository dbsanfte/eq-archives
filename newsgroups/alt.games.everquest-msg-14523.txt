}Man! there is so many strawmen here, I must ask....

Well, I don't see it that way.  To me, they look like legitimate arguments 
that deserve answers.  Many are phrased somewhat sarcastically.  But the 
fact of the matter is, if I do something, and the game responds in a 
certain way, I add that to my experience of how the game works.  To me, it 
is a feature of the game.  The only way I could tell that the game was not 
_intended_ to work that way for absolute certain is to have the programmer 
or some representative thereof, ie Verant, _tell_ me that that is not what 
was intended.  Especially since they have said they indended for MOBs to 
be able to attack through walls.  MY instincts and common sense would have 
said that was clearly a bug.  Therefore, it is obvious that trying to use 
my instincts and common sense to differentiate between 'bugs' and 
'undocumented features' is not a workable solution.  However, to date, 
Verant has said that they will not tell us what's what unless they slip 
up (so there's no point in asking), and it says in the RoC that we are 
specifically not to discuss it with anyone.  So basically, there's no way 
to tell.  As far as I can tell, the only thing that's absolutely 
guaranteed not to be an exploit is sitting quietly somewhere.  But I'm not 
going to advance in the game very far doing that.

Various people have suggested some rules of thumb.  A fairly good one 
seems to be the idea that if you gain an advantage and are at no risk, 
then it's exploiting.  Now.  Assume I go into an encounter.  How am I to 
know for certain that I am at risk or not at risk?  There's a huge number 
of variables to contend with.  Take the specific Conquest example of the 
warder on the bridge.  How do they know, for certain, that the mob is 
completely stuck?  How do they know that some pathing bug isn't going to 
snap and suddenly teleport the dragon to the bottom of the bridge?  They 
can make a fairly educated guess that that won't happen, but they _can't_ 
know for sure.  Not even if it worked last time.  They may have gotten 
lucky and the risk may not have come to fruition.  That's what risk is all 
about.  A _chance_ that something bad will happen.  But you can't know for 
certain, just because something bad didn't happen once, or even six times, 
that nothing bad will happen.  So you pretty much have to assume you're 
still at risk.

Similarly, I can go into an encounter with a green/safe con mob, and make 
a fairly educated guess that I am at no risk.  The con even tells me 
so!  The mob may even drop something exceedingly valuable, like Pyzjin, 
hence I derive an advantage.  Is fighting Pyzjin therefore an exploit?  I 
sure hope not.  I guess one could argue that there's the 'risk' she won't 
drop the friggin' GBS... Or the risk of dying of boredom waiting for her 
to spawn... :)

}Do you live in the middle of a Corn Field Rem?

Well, they do grow a lot of corn in this county, yes.  How is that 
relevant?  A straw man argument is a deliberate misrepresentation of your 
opponent's views.  I have explained Verant's views exactly as I hear them.  
If Verant feels I am misrepresenting their views, I would be glad to hear 
that.
