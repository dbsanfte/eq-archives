Yeah, it's a shame that the game doesn't allow for, dunno, say, something
you can buy from shaman that will increase your running speed without having
to bug a druid/ranger/shaman/BST for SoW.  Maybe priced at about 10p per
shot?

It's REALLY a shame that the game doesn't allow you to group with one of the
above classes.
It's a CRYING shame that you are unable to run a few zones away without SoW.
