Thanks.

Also, to add more info to this thread, my faster machine recently had its
SCSI card go out, so I've been playing EQ on my secondary machine.

It's a P2 450mhz, 256Mb RAM, Geforce 2 32Mb.

I have about 25% of the new models turned off, which is what the client
reccommended I do.

When I'm loading the game the first time, it takes a LONG time to load
everything (slow hard drive in this system).

Once I'm in the game, if I'm not in Luclin the game runs perfectly,
including if there are a bunch of new character models in view.

In many Luclin zones, I've needed to bring the clipping plane in a LOT
during combat and such... I can walk around with it out and it's bearable,
but not when the action starts.

All in all, however, I'd say the game is still very playable even this
significantly older machine.  I do know, however, that many people are
having problems and my understanding is that VI is working long and hard to
find out why certain machines that should be running the game fine aren't.
