SEND COMPLAINTS TO "  abuse@alt.net " about this monkey!  Let's keep our
newsgroups CLEAN (of him)!

Say he is violating their policies of :
Q: What is your policy on cross-posting?  (REVISED 12/3/2001)

A: Cross-posting ability is not to be used by customers for the purpose of
"cascading", "flaming", or "trolling". We may disable the cross-posting
ability of a customer if we believe they are cross-posting with one or more
of these purposes.

And he's violating about a half a dozen other "policies" that
http://www.altopia.com/ and http://www.alt.net (same) have.
