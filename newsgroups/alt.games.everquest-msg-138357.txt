Unless, of course, you pull the very top of the tower. Nice to meet 
you!! Your name is Myong? Heh fu.... LOADING PLEASE WAIT....

I do agree MM is one of the better places for those levels. I'd count it 
a major accomplishment if you take and hold the ballroom at that level. 
Haven't been there since the new caster rules.. it might be a bit 
"hectic" there now. 

Tower of frozen shadows seems to be pretty good for those levels (lower 
levels of the tower of course). Crystal caverns is another doable spot. 
I have fond memories of Dalnir.. we had fun equipping some monks while 
there.
