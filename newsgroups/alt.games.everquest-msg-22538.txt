Technically he was given a set of "No Rules". Training giants on any
other server would be an actionable offense. His actions only
highlight the need for rules. "No Rules" environments never work
unless there are true consequences for your actions. Video/PC games
never have "real" consequences. They just promote unending "Anonymous
Idiocy".

If you look at my original post to this thread, you will see that I
