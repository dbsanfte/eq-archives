I am planning a small EQ marathon on Thursday and Friday with my Level
8 Halfling paladin.  I have him on an alternate account and will be
PL'ing him with either my 29 Druid or 27 Enchanter until they can
group together.

I have a few hundred pp to blow on him for armor and was looking for
some suggestions for purchase.  I have only bought him a couple of
weapons (1 hs and 2 hs) and no armor so he is pretty much naked.  I
was working the newbie armor quests but after killing over 100 giant
yellow jackets and the like without success I would rather just spend
some cash.

After dressing him out any suggestions for places for PL'ing him with
either the druid or enchanter would be welcome.  It will only be
pre-Luclin zones. I will gladly accept suggestions for the duo once he
comes up to level too.
