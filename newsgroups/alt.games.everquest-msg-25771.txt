Thats good advice,Dan something that never occured to me.
Linkdeath is a funny old thing. I play EQ with my son, him in his
bedroom and me in my room, a couple of nights ago, we are playing in
LOIO and had just pulled a Sarnak, I had barbed him and Dotted the
Sarnak, and sat down to read my book. Then a loud shout of "SHIT" from
the bedroom, so I jump up thinking there is an add. Nope nothing
there, just him going toe to toe with the Sarnak, he then pops in the
room and says "Linkdead,can you pull him off me?"
I say "well look for yourself", and he stands and watchs as his
character batters the sarnak to death and he still has a 60%
complement of health, all the time he is reloading EQ. Sometimes it
takes ages to go LD other times it seems to be instant. So the advice
don't move is great advice, imagine running from a Spec in Oasis, you
head to the beach and go LD, you think at worst you died on the way to
the beach, NO at worst you went LD and kept on running then swimmming
then drowned, and then "where the hell has my corpse gone?"
/who gm all

hehe
