Suicide.  High elves suck. :p

But if you're intent on keeping your lousy choice <g> I don't know why you'd
worry about STR on your cleric as long as you can carry your armor and your
fair share of loot.   Your WIS is ok, though as a twink I'm surprised it's
not closer to 150-160.  You should definitely work on WIS above all else at
this level.  AC is also important, but not as important as later in life.

As for strength, don't worry about it.  I BELIEVE frost giant beards can be
used by anyone...if you get encumbered from loot just use that; they're
common enough.
