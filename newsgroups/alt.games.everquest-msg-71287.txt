I'd be amazed if it got an Oscar. Not because it doesn't deserve it -
it very probably does - but because the Oscar judges are a very stuffy
bunch. When was the last time a comedy won, for example? It would be
hard to imagine a fantasy winning.

My one fear with the movie is the almost assured influx of LoTR names
we're going to see in EQ. In the past, there was a price for admission
- you actually had to read the books. This kept at least some of the
riff-raff out. Now though, well, "Burger King light-up cups". Need I
say more?

When you look at what Jackson has done in the past, it's something of
a surprise that he managed to get this project, but from all reports
he's proven himself to be very much the right choice.

Spoiler replies below...

See, though, that's good! 

I'd read in reviews that the part with Tom Bombadil was cut - Tolkien
should have cut it, too. I've always had the feeling that he was going
to do something with that character, but never got around to it.

>Gimli got too few lines, I think he spoke about four times or so...
>But the dwarves looked Just Right, at least.

Perhaps he has more lines in the next two. There is flat out, bar
none, no better choice for actor in that role.

>Some parts were changed, for no apparent reason. For instance,

One thing about Tolkien - he wrote a male-based story. If you're going
to put Liv in a movie, then you'd damn well better make sure she has a
decent part! Besides, the Hollywood mentality probably insisted on
more female roles.

>Also, Gollum apparently was a monster from the get-go, rather than

Probably done for no reason other than brevity.
