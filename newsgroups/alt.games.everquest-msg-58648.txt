The perma bear pits make for amazing xp all the way to 60. Kind of sparse
for more than a pair or trio of people. When the shaman epic was bugged so
that it healed instead of dotted, I solod down there extensively. Made 23
blue (10 in 58, 13 in 59) there over 2 days. That xp bonus is amazing. The
drops completely suck however, and if vox is not alive, you need an evac or
gate potion to get 53+ non-gaters out when you are done.
