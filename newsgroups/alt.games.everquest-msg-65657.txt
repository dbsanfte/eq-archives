Oh, I agree... I'm happy with the card... graphics are smoother, faster,
etc...  What I'm not happy with is the complete reversal they did...  Oh, if
you want to play, you need to upgrade...(wait 24 hrs) Oh, we fixed the
problem with your old chip... Neener, neener, neener!  I -could- have taken
the card back and gotten my money back, but chose not to, since the graphics
are that much better in -everything-, not just EQ.
