I agree, the idea sucks.  Just throwing stuff out there to see what we could
do with it.  TCC in Droga would do the same thing to your earring camp,
wouldn't it?

Basically, making it more difficult to get  people into a zone, via Naggy
code or TCC or anything else, doesn't seem like a sensible approach
for getting more people in there.  Now if you put TCC in Crushbone,
say, that might help; give the people in there farming belts off of greenies
reason to go somewhere else.  Identify the overcrowded zones and
TCC or even Naggy em (if they aren't on the pathway to somewhere
else)  Plan being not to get lowbies in there, but rather to get the higher
levels to go elsewhere.

Only problem is, I don't think more than 10% of us go in and farm
green stuff on any sort of regular basis, so this A) won't remove
all that many people from the "hot" zones and B) won't pump
that many more people into the level appropriate ones.
