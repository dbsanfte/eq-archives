What way do you use to get to the sk guild in queynos? i have used the
aquaduct once with my now defunct lvl 5 necro(converted to magician)
but after that i started to use the arena entrance, no enemies that
way and it is fairly easy to find you way, can more or less only go
one way, and the guild it self is way cool i think :)

Regards Berth aka

Animalking lvl 7 druid
Nephistotele lvl 1 magician
Nexxius lvl 6 bard

Thulandrathuu lvl 5 shadow knight
Zillanex lvl 5 shaman
