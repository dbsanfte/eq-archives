Hating the "stupid" only reaffirms your stupidity. Intelligence can be
rather relative. There is a big difference between intelligence and
education. Some of the most educated people I know are complete idiots,
while some of the least educated people I know are actually quite
intelligent. Generally, you should probably accept people the way they are-
whether or not you like them is a different matter.

For instance, I despise Bizbee. However, I respect him for being himself in
our increasingly politically correct world.

See my point? Just because I hate him, doesn't mean I cannot accept him for
who he is. So why hate the "stupid" when in some way, anyone can outwit you.
To claim you're the best only sets you up for a large defeat.

Newbies are persecuted. And the higher level people always assume that
because my Necromancer isn't wearing an Advisor Robe and a Harvester, that
I'm just an ignorant newbie. Now just because I'm new to pure Necromancy (I
have a Shadow Knight as well) does that mean I'm necessarily inferior to
anyone else? Only to those that feel they have to call me a "n00b" to feel
better about their otherwise meaningless life.

I hope I've clarified my points and I look forward to another intelligent
response by Twohead.
