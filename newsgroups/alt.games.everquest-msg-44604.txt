I started baking this weekend.  I've been camping Pyzjn again ( 32 kills and
4GBS!  Time to go get EXP again... ) and fishing / begging my pet in the
wait time.  I got a spit and used the fish I caught and jugs of sauces to
get my baking to 82.  I killed a lot of bats and large bats while I was
wandering QHill, so I made the fish rolls with the bat wings and fish after
that.  If you cna't forage, I suggest going with meat pie or rat ear pie.
You will need a mixing bowl and a pie tin.  Mix a milk, flour, and an egg
( I get them from snakes ) in the mixing bowl, and then mix the resulting
dough with a rat ear or chunk of meat in the spit / oven ( I don't have a
pie tin, yet, so I can't guarantee this is right, going by memory here ).
Trivials at about 142.  A lot of work for getting 7 points, but tradeskills
shouldn't be easy, right?

On an unrelated note, quite a while back we were talking about learning
languages, and why I would ever become a master at every language.  I have
another reason to add to the list.  I met a guy quite a while back who was
trivialing Wu's.  I bought some Wu's from him at cost, and taught him a
language.  Now, he is trying to max out every skill in the game that he can.
He has most of them high and his Jewelry is at 250.  I mastered him in every
language that he was missing ( about 8 or 9 ) this weekend and now I have
someone that can tradeskill for me when I need it.  How nice.  Some Velium
jewelry sounds good right about now...
