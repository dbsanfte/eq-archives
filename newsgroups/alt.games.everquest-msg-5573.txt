I just went through that, and found that, at that level, +mana is
better than +wis. I spent a bit more, but got a  Chrysoberyl Talisman
for 250pp (I sold a Forest Loop for 375) and used the rest for a +20
mana ring, a magic scimitar (velium), and a +3wis earring. I got more
mana from the ring and amulet than I did from the wis boosts. I am
sure at higher levels 3 wis is more than 20 mana, but for now, I deal
with the more efficient. The ring was 20pp (I helped the owner when
she was dying, so she conned warmly during the sale).
