When I solo a mob with my Druid and hit it with DoT spells the mobs HP are
not accuratly reflected on the screen.  However, If I hit the mob with a DD,
re-root him or if he hits me, his HP is updated.  This makes me waste a lot
of mana (the conservation of which is the main reason I'm using DoT in the
first place) since I often re DoT a "half" dead mob only to have him keel
over and die a couple of seconds later.

I have a new PC lots of memory big processor and a GForce3.  Is there a
setting or something I can change to make the mobs HP update correctly?
