 I logged on my second computer but at the character screen all text
was missing. After logging on one character no fonts was listed on the
options window. Also when I right click on a window for the nemu all I
get is a line almost like the window without any text.

I searched the character files and lists the font as Arial. The font
is in the same place as before. I even tried coping the font to the eq
folder and still didn't work.

Any suggestions?
