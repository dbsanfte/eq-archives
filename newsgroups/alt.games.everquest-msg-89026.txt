Oddly it was other people going LD tonight and not me. It seems these lag
spikes always affect major portions of the population, so although it may
not be verants problem exactly, they need to get their bandwidth/reliability
sorted out. Its at the stage now where its pointless playing a solo class
past 50, unless you have a 49+ cleric on call. Soloing+LD=dead, almost every
time.

Druid score: monsters:20% LD:80% (80%=all monsters I can run away from
easily)
Cleric score: monsters:100% LD:0%

I can adapt. Guess I wont be playing my druid much anymore.
/sigh
