(going to bite and give a straight answer)

i love playing a cleric because at just the ripe ol' age of 40, i can heal
anyone, no matter what their level

i don't know of being a cleric is boring, because i 2box the cleric with a
monk/warrior, my main(s)

other than possibly being repetitive, being a cleric is very rewarding when
you do a good job

leveling up a cleric can be difficult, but i think it's worth it
