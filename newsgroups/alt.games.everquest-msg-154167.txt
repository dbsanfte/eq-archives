The bazaar has really mixed up how people sell and trade in EQ. Before you
could /auction your wares and get some instant feedback, so the market was
"more alive", changing as new items came and as others left.

Now, most sellers are /trader and so there prices are not up for negotiation
and although a few /auction folks do still exist, the traders outweigh them,
so they *will* dictate the prices usually, especially if lower than /auction
folks.

The spidersilk example was rather funny, but I have noticed that most folks
will check the bazaar and them adjust their price lower than the cureent
/trader to get the sale. So if you have no clue on the price, then you will
adopt the pricing of whoever else is selling.

My argument is not without holes or exceptions I am not a permenant /trader
or /auction-eer so I often weigh my items againt others or ask myself what I
would pay for it....it's harder now to know what is too much, but as long as
you got a buyer then you must be doing something right!
