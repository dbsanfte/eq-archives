technically, they are not 100% magic resistant

the mobs just have a very, very, *very* high magic resistance

have a high level person pull them singly, kill them one by one (they're
easy), and stop spreading the fuss about how difficult this whole thing is
=P

lvl 59 enc mez, rapture, is unresistable, and does work quite well on
phinny's guards...i'd imagine bards have some kind of workaround for them
too

but seriously, just pull them in singles, and kill them.....they're cake
