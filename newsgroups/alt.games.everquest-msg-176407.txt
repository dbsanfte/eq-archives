Just to continue this to get the point across.  I was in a group in PoN
the other day with an SK and a Warrior.  The warrior was a few levels
higher than the SK.  Guess who the MT was?  The SK.  I don't think I
ever saw the warrior get damaged or the mob turn to him, except once
when the SK feined as he got back because he got a serious beat down
pulling a mob.
