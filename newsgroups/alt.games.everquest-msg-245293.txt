No, you can't.  =)

Archery at your level doesn't even come close to the damage that you can do
just swinging a sword, and won't for a good long time.  My ranger twink in
the 50s still does better damage swinging a sword, and has a far-above-level
no-drop bow (bows rot on my guild's raids constantly, not hard to bring in a
twink to grab a nice one).

When a ranger is 60+, with a few dozen AAs, that is when archery starts to
become a viable alternative to melee.  I never considered it all that
overpowered, though it's definitely not underpowered.
