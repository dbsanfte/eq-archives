I disagree.   It makes a HUGE chuck of change.  :-)

On my server, leather padding sells for 20pp per stack.  I'll either
farm silks and skins or sometimes I'll just buy the stuff (10pp for
a skin and 6pp for a thread yields a 25% profit).

Or I'll find somebody selling pads for 15pp, buy them all from him/her,
and turn around and sell them for 20pp.  Quick (and easy) 5pp profit
each.  Do that for 5 stacks and you've just made 500pp.  Without ANY
effort.
