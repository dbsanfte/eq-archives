You don't have to, but you can buy, find, or create with tradeskills upgrades
to your automatic ones.  For instance, you have Smite (Apprentice I) for free
as a priest class.  All your spells will appear this way for free.

There are 11 upgrades to this spell that won't be free.  Apprentice II-IV,
Adept I-IV, and Master I-IV.  Some are bought, some are dropped, and some are
crafted from annoyingly-rare components.  You only have the best one in your
spellbook (scribing a new level replaces the old one), and you don't need them
in order (you can scribe Master IV even if you only have Apprentice I).
AFAIK, there are no level limits on the upgrades.

Nope, but they'll be available to the appropriate class if you're grouped with
them.  Even in beta, the ability to coordinate the HO chain distinguished good
groups from pickup free-for-alls.  I suspect (and kind of hope) this will be a
key player (as opposed to character) skill in the midgame.

In beta, at least, it was a pretty risk-free world.  I ran from Qeynos to
Freeport at leave 12, just for kicks.  There are KOS things that can kill you,
but you know which ones they are in advance (red outline on the name), and the
aggro range is generally fairly small.  Almost NOTHING will chase you very far
if you sprint away.

Explore away.  There's probably not that much for you to kill solo until level
10 or so, though.  If you're trying to xp grind rather than just look around,
you're probably better off in the newbie hunting grounds.
