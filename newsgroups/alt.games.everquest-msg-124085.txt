Making sense in what sense? Making an already very powerful class (the 
ultimate damage dealers when grouped, and essential in some dungeons) even 
more desirable?

You can't have been playing for that long if you missed the melee balancing 
that prompted the current caster balancing.

Hey, I had an idea... Since historically Druids used to make human 
sacrifices, it think it makes a lot of sense to take the lvl 60 rogue 
"assasinate" skill and give it to Druids also. I wonder what Verant would 
think of the idea...
