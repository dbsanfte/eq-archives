>>>I have heard there is a quest in Halas (gnoll fang?) that is the least
painful way to raise
 it, but I have no idea how viable that quest would be for a Gnome Necro.<<<

Not viable in the least. A gnome necro starts KOS in Halas, same way they
start KOS in Kaladim.

I was hoping to find a way to raise Steel Warrior faction also, since I
wanted to do the Qeynos badge quests ... however, the first quest expects
you to walk right into the Steel Warriors Guild.

And after you kill the Clothspinner chick in EK for a few levels ... they
don't like you too much.
