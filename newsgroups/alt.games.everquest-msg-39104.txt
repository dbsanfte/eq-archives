You're smoking crack.
First off they halved the exp penalty from deaths, then they REMOVED
the hybrid exp penalty, combine this with all the how-tos and spoilers
and maps available for practically EVERY damn zone in the game and you
have a damn near trivial game compared to when folks first started out
2 and a half years ago.

Toss in the tremendous saturation of equipment in the current
economny.  I remember when I started a Paladin over two years ago on
Xegony--you couldn't find a banded mail to save your life!

It would take you DAYS of hunting to get enough money to attempt to
make just ONE banded mail piece!  I was using a bronze longsword and a
wooden buckler well into level 12!  These days most highlevels camping
static spawns will let ringmail/bronze rot or drop them on PoDs.

Even accounting for all the nerfs we've seen, the game is so much
easier today than 2 and half years ago, the comparison is laughable.
