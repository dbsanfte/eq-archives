If I'm thinking of it right, Drom's is stackable, so you just give a partial
stack of 4 to the guy and the game treats it like 4 seperate turn ins (like
4 stacks of 4 bone chips for kaladim/cabilis).

My deceased warrior liked to drink Innoruuk's Kiss a lot, but it's lore so
he could only have one stack at a time, and if I accidentally ctrl clicked
to pull one out of a bag to drink, *poof* goes the rest of the stack.
