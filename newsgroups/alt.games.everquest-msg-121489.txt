Charm is highly overrated.  I wish it wasn't true, but it is.  Other classes
marvel at an enchanter's ability to make a giant do his bidding, but more
often than not the charm breaks fairly early, giving the enchanter more
stuff to worry about.

But if you're dead set on creating a charmer, keep in mind that bards can't
charm until 27 or 28, and enchanters can start charming at level 12.

Although the jury is still out on the affect of charisma, it certainly can't
HURT to have that number high.  If you don't give a damn about race then I'd
probably start an Erudite and stick points in Charm.  But there's no way I'd
create one...they're almost as snooty as high elves.
