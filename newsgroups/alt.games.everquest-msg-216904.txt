The earliest post of mine I can find is Mar 30, 1999.

My screen name was the same as my isp account name (Orang).
I found the post by searching for my first character's name
(Tindayen).

I didn't change my name to hide anything, it's just that
I had problems with Teleport and switched ISP's (then got
DSL and switched again), plus I've used several computers
with a variety of news software - I don't always enter it
the exact same way :-P

Of note - My post was in response to a post by Dennis, I'd forgotten
he was around that long.
