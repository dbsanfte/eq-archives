/agree with Graeme
There may be a bug, I have no clue if there is one. Now if there is
one then WOOT a bug in my favor and all I have to do is nuke and
thump.  Thank You Sony!!!!!!!!!!
/tongue in cheek post done
The rest about "clerics would never level, they would always lag
behind" I agree and that is just what happens to my druid and cleric.
So I go out and get me a meatshield (now only 2 of us) and do some
catch up.
I am sure there are many more factors (that is the Sony way of things)
but the trend/data I have seen with my 2 toons pointed me to my method
Graeme gave me a lot to think about thanks
PS it is fun to thump now and again also
