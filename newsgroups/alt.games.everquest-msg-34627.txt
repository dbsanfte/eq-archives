With my shaman I gave up, and realized that Alteration was going to be his
specialization.  I put 10 points into Specialize Evocation, one point into
each of the others.  Played normally.  My specialize Alteration is just over
100 now, my others are around 50, Evocation is in second place at 55 or so.
The sad thing is that the spell that kept pushing up Alteration is
Cannibalize.
