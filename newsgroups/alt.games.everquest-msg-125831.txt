Yeah, it works there too.  My wife's druid uses it and
hasn't gotten a higher-level version yet, AFAIK.  The
*only* change in behavior is that the higher-level
versions can (and will) remove more counters than the
lower-level versions and may totally eliminate more than
the "target" spell.

Cancel Magic (CLR/14 PAL/39 RNG/30 SHD/39 DRU/19 SHM/19 NEC/16
WIZ/12 MAG/12 ENC/8 BST/39) is a spell that a LOT of the "support"
classes get.  And, surprise, surprise, you can actually cast it
on someone else while NOT getting beat on at all.  My cleric
used it quite a bit;  so has my wife's druid.  And my cleric
could certainly cast it while getting beat on, as can my wife.
Hell, my wife has cast Lesser Succor (DRU/18, 10.5 sec casting
time) successfully more than a few times while getting beat on.
Hell, she cast Lesser Succor *twice* in a row last week when
the first cast moved me but not her, both times with mobs on her.

Casting a 3.5 sec casting time spell isn't that much of a problem
unless you're either getting pounded on by reds (with faster
attacks) or several mobs, at least if you've paid attention to
your Defense and you know a little bit about positioning.
