i play regularly in a fixed group with a zerk (70) and they are fantastic 
dps ... he's parsing around 300 and that's without any AA

the stun he uses (65+) is resisted maybe 1/2 the time he uses it, so he 
doesn't really bother....his snare is more reliable though as he leveled

he hits flurry and volley all the time ... lots of spam, lots of crits, lots 
of damage

far as tanking goes, again, no AA, but he's definitely about the same as a 
ranger or rogue (makes sense) though he has a lot of HP - and he says he's 
on a warrior's HP table, but i have no idea about that

and most people still have no idea what they really do - and even some 
top-end people don't know about warcry, so all the dps in the world doesn't 
add character to a flat class like zerk
