*The* most useful skill.  The tough part is you have to remember to use it
instead of trying to land a heal.  It's no-aggro and with a well-equipped
group can be nearly a CH.  It can also be used to save a rapidly dying
enchanter before a regular heal would even have a chance to land.  When the
warrior goes berserk and you've just sat back down with a fresh soda, it
sets up the next CH.  Fighting with a paladin in the group to cover the DA
(need a new acronym) with group heals is great too.  Every cleric I've
talked to that has it loves it.

Eh.  :)

Both of those are also very useful.  I'd still put DivArb ahead by a bit,
but I know radiant cure is becoming almost a necessity for some fights.
