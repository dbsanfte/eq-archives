As much as I'm annoyed by the DAoC fanboise who were posting here a lot
some months back, I don't think Orlun was referring to that. The fact
is, the game is limited by the technology used to create it. You can
make upgrades, etc. but unless they figure out some *really* fancy
footwork, some fundamental parts of the game will always be stuck in and
limited by underlying 1997 code and hardware.

It's a popular genre with a lot of competition. Eventually the ability
to make a clear-cut better product will arrive and be coupled with some
folks with the experience to put together a good game conept like Verant
has. At that point, there may well have to *be* and exit strategy. 

Pong was a great and fascinating game in it's time. (Oh, lord, I'm
dating myself here. Anyone else remember actually *playing* pong?). But
can you find it now outside of a museum? No. Newer and better things
come along. And so, Verant will have to decide whether or not to migrate
everyone to some sort of "EQ 2" based on emerging technologies, or exit
gracefully and hope everyone picks up on their next "latest and
greatest", be it Star Wars or what have you.

This, as I said, is assuming that they can't find some fancy footwork to
suddenly shift the existing Norrathian infrastructure onto a next
generation platform without wiping us all out first.
