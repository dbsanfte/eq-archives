How ya doing you old troll.

You miss, as most times, the point. Let me try again and I promise to
speak slowly and no big words...

We.. just.. dont ..know ..how ..many ..people ..play ..this ..game.  

Its just that simple, I corrected the idea that number of accounts
equaled number of players is all. Since when did it? Pre-Kunark if
then?

I maintain again , for the logic and reading impaired, none of us has
any idea how many players there are in EQ. Sony does or at least they
know how many different billing addresses they have minus cards. But
they dont publish that figure for whatever reason. 

Now what were you saying? Paycheck from SoE late again? Sheesh
