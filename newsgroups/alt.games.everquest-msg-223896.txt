                            This JUST in:

                                 Quote:

                                 The EverQuest game community has continued to
grow and evolve over its prosperous
                                 lifespan. However the wondrous changes to the
game that made that possible may not have
                                 met with the expectations of all of our
players. The means by which a character interacts
                                 with the world has changed in many ways. The
unfortunate effect of some of these changes
                                 is that the character you chose to begin and
carefully developed may no longer fit the role
                                 you had once imagined. This leaves players with
the burden of restarting from level 1 so that
                                 their character can better fit their glorious
vision of a hero in the land of Norrath. 

                                 After much effort we have obtained a system by
which you can realize your dreams without
                                 having to forsake all of your hard work. We are
hereby implementing the Multiplayer
                                 Interactive Lifetime Characterization as a
value added service. The options of this service are
                                 as follows:

                                 Statistic point reallocation only - $10
                                 Race reselection only - $10
                                 Race AND statistic point reallocation - $15
                                 ($5 savings)

                                 Class reselection, no gear - $50
                                 (Note that this service is only available if
both classes are a possible selection for your race, if
                                 otherwise you will have to purchase the
applicable above services as well.)

                                 Class reselection, all gear - $75
                                 (This means some of your gear you may no longer
be able to equip or utilize in the same
                                 fashion, but you will still benefit from many
of the all/all items as well as the value of all
                                 droppables on your character or in their
personal bank.)

                                 Class reselection, transformed gear - $100

                                 This is our PREMIER service. A dedicated team
of Multiplayer Online Nodrop Cross-class
                                 Equipment Evaluators has created a
transformational matrix that will systematically replace all
                                 of your no-drop equipment with the equivalent
item for your new class.

                                 A class reselection will result in a refund of
ALL Alternate Advancement points. ALL Alternate
                                 Advancement points ABOVE 30 will be lost the
first time the character zones. It is your
                                 responsibility to allocate them promptly. Due
to game mechanics a GM will not be allowed to
                                 replace AA points that are lost by zoning with
an excessive amount of unspent AA.

                                 A character is elligible for this service once
per six month period. Accounts may have up to
                                 three characters so altered independently
during any six month period. Like all other value
                                 added services we retain the right to refuse
any individual request and to discontinue this
                                 program without notice.

                                 We have received feedback requesting a religion
reselection value added service. However it is
                                 our foremost intent to preserve the integrity
of the game and therefore we can not offer
                                 such a service.






                            Wow...
