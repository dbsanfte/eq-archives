We didnt need a new race really - I only suggested that a new class would
have been more interesting than the frogs - nothing wrong with the frogs -
such issues undoubtedly lead to the decision of race over class. Its just
there is more inherently new with a class than a race....

I wouldnt mind a Chanter/rogue type

At the moment for hybrids there is a necro hybrid, a cleric hybrid, a
druid hybrid and a shammy hybrid. Warrior and monk are covered for the
fighting side....

This leaves chanter, mage and wiz for the casting side, and rogue from the
melee if you want something completely new. That drops mage out for me as
the BST is a pet based hybrid. From that rogue/chanter is to me the most
interesting - call it I dunno 'the merchant' :P

There is no generally available neutral hybrid warrior/caster to fit
between the Pally and the Shadowknight, the ranger doenst fit as its too
'goodly' aligned - the thick races obviously can cast cos they have int
based casters in SKs just not as well as say the wis based shammies they
use. So a fitting one would be a Neutral, generally available
Warrior/caster, probably the Wiz, a bit of porting, a bit of nuking, some
minor buffs on a light tank base.

Its not extortionately new though, but it fills a gap.

I wont even begin to suggest the idea of a bard hybrid with anything since
its got a little of everything already
