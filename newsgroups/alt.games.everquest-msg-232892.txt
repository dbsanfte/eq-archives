I bought the CD for LDON because i thought that even tho it was a bit more
expensive than downloading, a 50 % weight reduction bag would be much
appreciated. When I installed it and updated my game with the CD key, the
latest files were downloaded but I got the message "no reward is pending for
this account" when i typed /claim. Has anyone gotten this?

 I've tried petitioning it .. I presume the CD key given is still valid and
it didn't expire or something? Certainly there was nothing on the box saying
it was a limited offer?
