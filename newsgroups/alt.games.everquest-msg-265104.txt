It was killing me on the second character typed in the chat window,
consistently.  Didn't affect the bug window, so I /bugged it.

Tried playing without texting, but got kicked after a couple of minutes.
So, off to the website, found the "reboot your machine" post.  Did so, no
problems after that.

Other things, however...

The new crafting symbols, a whole truckload of them, are seriously gibbled.
Found that I could get skillups just by randomly poking them, that was
useful.  Found that *any* symbol could be used as a response while working
at the woodworking table.  Had to use matching ones at the forge, though.
That was painful to find out.  Also, the casting bar's gone missing when
using the modifier "spells".

Prices on the vendors got modded a bit, here and there.  And I found a
lovely exploit.  Sale price on tin arrows was set to 125 pence.  Now,
construction price figures out to 134 pence, so no problem.  Until you
remember that construction makes about 7 arrows.  It got bugged, of course.
Arrow price this morning is now set to 7 pence.  That's actually overkill.
Break-even's at about 13 pence.

Also, vendors are now offering slightly different prices depending on the
quality of what you're selling.  All of my previous experience was that the
prices were identical for, say, crude / shaped / normal / pristine elm
lumber.

Live in 2 weeks, and I'm preordered.  Oh, I've also got 4 days of holidays
booked starting the evening of the 10th.

I've got a fit, now I just have to find a shan.
