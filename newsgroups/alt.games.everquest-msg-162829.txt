Disabling NetBIOS over TCP/IP should do it as well (if I remember this
one right), and would probably be a good idea in general.

Go to your Network Connections control panel and right click on your
Local Area Connection.  Click on Properties.  Highlight TCP/IP, click
Properties.  Click on the Advanced button, then click on the WINS tab.
At the bottom should be a choice between 3 radio buttons.  Click on
Disable NetBIOS over TCP/IP.  Click OK all the way back out.  You may
have to reboot for the setting to take effect, not sure about that.
