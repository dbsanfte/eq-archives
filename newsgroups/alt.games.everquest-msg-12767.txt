I think you should research warriors a little bit before jumping in. If
you're planning to play past your teens, drop 20 into stam and 5 into
str. Keep agi above 75 with items and ALWAYS choose AC over everything
until you get to your 50s when you can start swapping out with +hps and
resists

Oh, 2 more things:

1: NEVER beg. Ogres aren't beggers.

2: If you're planning to RP your Ogre, please do it well. Nothing worse
than a poorly RPed Ogre
