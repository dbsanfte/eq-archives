The healing/mana ratio looks like it is 3.56 to 1.  That's pretty good,
compared to the other heals the Shaman has at that level.  That would make
it good for healing between fights.

It could also be useful when the Shaman is healing casters.  My Wizard
doesn't really care if his attack speed is slowed. :-)  (Last time he swung
his staff at anything, it was a giant in Kael, just for the hell of it...and
the damn thing riposted for about 120).
