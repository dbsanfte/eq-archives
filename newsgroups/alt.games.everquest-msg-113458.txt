Hey Aggemammon ... I don't have SoW yet, but will in a few more
levels.  If you ever find me, I'd be more than happy to cast SoW for
you.  I do alittle grouping from time to time, but generally, I like
soloing. My normal session usually consist of starting out in CB
getting as much experience, money, and loot as possible for the
evening.  Then, on my last trip back to Kilithin, I like to stop off
at orc hill and at the druid ruins and just watch whats going on,
casting heals and buffs on others who look like they could use alittle
help.  It's fun.  Some bow, some thank me, some have no clue what just
happened :)   In any case, my point is, don't disparage against druids
as a whole because you ran into some bad ones.  Perhaps they know
something we don't and I'll understand better once I get SoW, who
knows......but for now you have my promise, you ask, I'll cast.
