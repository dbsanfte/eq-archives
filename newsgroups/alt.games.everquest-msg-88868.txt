    Because they don't know about the quests they're used for, and don't
know that high-level players will purchase them. The Kaladim bone chip quest
is a good example - by doing the quest you come out ahead on cash versus
just selling the chips to the vendor, AND you get a ton of XP, and you get
good faction. But you can still find bone chips on Kaladim-area vendors,
because real newbies don't know about the quest.
