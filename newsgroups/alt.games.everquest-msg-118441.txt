Not sure if this is what you mean but you can hand in Kobold Molars (which
you can get by killing Kobolds in the Warrens) to a guard in the Paineel
Citadel/Castle in return for experience, money and sometimes a piece of
armour. It about as close as you'll get to an armour quest there I think.

I'm not sure on the name of the guard right now, but IIRC he's fairly easy
to find.
