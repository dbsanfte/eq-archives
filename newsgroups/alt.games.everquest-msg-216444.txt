Other popular methods are:

Ranger tanks the animal while the paladin heals; remember, paladins have
decent heals at that level, plus almost certainly own a DW helm which will
provide the equivalent of 100point mana free heals for hours on end.  If they
also own a mount, then they'll be able to use both their heals and their DW
helm while medding back the heal.  A 500point regen with the equivalent of a
level 50 druid for heals on hand?  Not bad, even when its only a ranger doing
the tanking.

Ranger does 51% of the killing, paladin finishes off the mob.

Safer; paladin does 49% of the killing, ranger finishes off the mob.

Also, Paladin chain stuns the mob while the ranger kills it; this is like a
massive slow

DS the paladin, he pulls and lets the mob nearly kill itself on him while the
ranger practices archery; keep the mob rooted.  As long as the ranger does at
least one point and the paladin does no damage at all, the ranger gets the
kill.  Sadly, rangers don't get much of a DS, and paladins don't get one at
all unless they have some kind of clicky gear, so this probably isn't too
good.

And the ever popular "paladin almost kills the mob, then zones and the ranger
finishes it off"

I'd look at the pyramids in DL, which are populated by single killable undead
that will be easily single pulled and will be decent exp for several more
levels, plus lots and lots of room for kiting if desired.  Another good undead
spot will be ME, and the Grey, but both of those are trickier, harder, and
have less kiting room without adds.  I'm not sure this duo can handle Umbral
remains, although they will be good exp for quite a while longer, at a minimum
you might want to group for them instead of handicapping yourselves by trying
to arrange for the ranger to outdamage the paladin.
