Well, it wasn't for me, so don't hate me.

I think total time, including travel was between 90 minutes and an hour for
her to get both corrupted mobs.

The Gorilla we ended up having to wait for 45 minutes or so, as UPS got one
tainted that did not spawn a corrupted, and they needed two corrupted
Gorillas.  Took them about 45 minutes to get three tainted, then we had that
long 5 minute or so wait until the next tainted popped, and the corrupted
spawned for us when he died.

Maybe I should bring her along to get that Burning Priest, with her luck,
shouldn't take but a spawn or two to pop him.
