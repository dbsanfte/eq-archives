Aye, there's that, but this is a 65 druid we are talking about.  For 
him, its not all that important.

And given the speed at which the 50s go by, these days, I put it to you 
that that its just not all that important to anyone.

Recall too that his current main is a cleric, and consider whether that 
might make him think an epic is a big deal.  Not many epics are useful 
on that scale.
