In this particular case, the thief changed the account information using the
Sony website so that when he did the password recovery, the new password was
emailed to him instead of the original owner.  They don't just reset the
password back to the previous password.  In order to do the password
recovery, you have to have information about the original account, such as
the CD key, and/or the original credit card used.
