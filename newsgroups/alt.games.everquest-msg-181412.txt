To get on your everliving nerves, that's all.  Actually it's something
about the game mechanics, the mobs ignore silly things like walls. 
Sounds like you
are playing in EC, that's where i noticed that sort of thing at your level.

Try not to sit in the middle of the zone, most of the edges of the zone 
are safe to sit and med up.  If you want to make sure, try to find a 
guard and stick close to him until you are ready to go back out and kill 
the critters.
