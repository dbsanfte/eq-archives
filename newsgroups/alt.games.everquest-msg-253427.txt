There's an NPC selling Paladin discipline tomes somewhere in the
Great Library, I'm sure.  I bought mine from an NPC in the East
Commonlands tunnel, though I'm not sure why as Paladin discs
aren't even worth the 2cp you pay for the tome.  I'm pretty sure
there's a vendor in EC tunnel for every class with discs, though
I could be wrong about that.
