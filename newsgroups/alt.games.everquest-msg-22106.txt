No, he's right. There's no way in hell you'll be able to maintain
anything resembling a constant setup.  Even if you do find a
reasonably constant combat setup, you'll still be swapping spells out
for buffs as they're needed (keeping a buff that only needs to be cast
twice an hour memmed all the time isn't exactly a good way to
prioritize things) I'm guessing the best you can hope for is *maybe*
getting 6 spells that are rarely changed and using 2 slots for
swapping out buffs.
There's no need to hotkey everything either. The only thing I have
hotkeyed is my healing message, anything else that needs to be said
can usually be typed. And if you're worried about casting the wrong
spell, remember that hitting the alt key will list which spells you
have memorized and which slot they're in, and you'll cast by pressing
the corresponding number while still holding in the alt key.
I think your shaman will be much more enjoyable if you get over the
need to have everything hotkeyed and use alt combinations to cast
instead, because there's no getting around the spell swapping.


---- I play a 23 level Shaman as my main character and always keep my first
two
spell slots for Gate (in case of emergencies) and Heal (same reason). The
remaining six are used for Buffs as needed and then swapped to
weapon spells after I am buffed up.  Everything is mapped to number
keys for convenience.  This is the easiest way I have found to keep things
in order and less cumbersome.  Of course, it doesn't cut down on the time
it takes to swap things out, but as discussed elsewhere in this newsgroup,
that is either a part of the game you have to live with or something
intolerable..... since I play the character I do, it is something I have to
accept.
