Frog is only Mith Marr.

Fierce Heraldic is only Rallos Zek.  And not Cleric usable.

Luminant Heraldic is the Mith Marr stuff, and probably not frog usable.
(hum/hef only so far)

ODS is good choice
Shadel ring
6 ac/65 hp ring until you can equip circled toe bones or valorium ring
without severe stat reductions.
Earring of the solstice (the FT works at level 1)
Electrum black sapphire earring (2 ac 35 hp 25 mana) or one of the 2 ac 35
hp/mana + click effect earrings from chardok... Earring of purity is one I
think, there's 2 that are cleric usable.
Orb of the Infinite Void
Dark Ember
A lot of thurg armor MQs if you feel like doing the faction. and have the
armor available.
Belt of Thunderous Auras (ft2, no req level)
Hierophant's Cloak
Coldain skin Gloves
Coldain skin boots or Eboots
Death Mask of the Elysians
Supple Scale Armband (no drop but really easy to get)
Fungi tunic (er, if it's frog equippable anyways)

Umm... Thats about all I can think of that doesn't either a) suck, b) cost 3
souls and a testicle, or c) have req/rec level (and no FT to compensate)
