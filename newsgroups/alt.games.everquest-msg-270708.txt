Power regen -- EQ2 doesn't have "mana" -- is determined
by two factors:  the drink you are using and whether you
are in combat in not ("in combat" means you've locked an
encounter, not a mob has aggro'd on you.)   Health regen
is determined the same way except with food instead of
drink.   Food/drink from order of worst to best:  summoned
(by priests), merchant bought, crafted (in crafting quality
order by tier -- a pristine gives more regen than shaped
item, food/drink from tier 1 items (newbie zones) give less
regen than food/drink from higher-level zones, in order.
Regen inside combat is minimal.   Exactly how much
regen is involved with everything isn't specified in-game
yet;  it's supposed to be in today's patch (unless they
moved the big patch back.)

There's another "gift" in there too -- if you level to a multiple
of 10%, you get instant full health/power.  That can occur
inside fights with multiple mobs or after.

The EQ2 forums are okay and a lot of the basics are there.
I'm not fond of web forums in general but the content is
there if you look.
