I'm stubborn but I do change my mind sometimes.  :)

I can't think of anything awe inspiring or romantic about looting
your corpse in a more tedious fashion.

I *do* think travel by foot *can* be awe inspiring and romantic for
True Newbies (tm).

Please keep in mind that I agree that experienced players should

That's too generalized.  I think easy travel is good for experienced
players and bad for True Newbies (tm), though I'll admit that I'm not
sure where to draw the line between "newbie" and "oldbie".

I can only imagine SOE doesn't consider that a problem, otherwise
they'd put level limits (upper and lower) on spells, equipment,
items, etc.
