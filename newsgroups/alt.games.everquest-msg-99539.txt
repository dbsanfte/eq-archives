Thanks for the feedback!  Over the last few days of doing research it has
become apparent that Verant did not do any survey of their customer base
before bringing this service online.  If Customer Service is the only
significant difference on this server then that would rarely apply to me.
Only time I ever needed help was a time I was exploring the new zones on
Luclin and decided to take a swim arround a pond I found.  Well, I got into
it and then found out that there was no way out.  Had to petition to get
someone to come over and beam me out of it.

I am looking forward to Never Winter Nights coming out.  It will not be a
MMORG but it will give you the tools to build your own world and campaigns
so that your friends can log into your game server and you run the game.
That will be really cool.

For 39.95 a month they should include really dynamic content.  One thing
that let me down when I first started playing this game was that if a mob
was killed then it would just respawn again after a certain amount of time.
How many times has Lady Vox really been killed?  Only mob that I know of
that does not respawn is the Sleeper.  It would require MUCH more effort on
the part of Verant but it would take this game to the next level.  This
probably is beyond the capability of the game engine.  Waiting for EverQuest
2 to come out.  I think it is about time this version is put to rest.
