    In a related note, what level do you have
to be to cast your first familiar, and where
do you get the spell?  
   I spent all morning on my day off practicing
Teabomb's conjuration... got her up to 85.  And
in the med times, I went AFK and did some house
work.  Now my kitchen floor is clean again!
