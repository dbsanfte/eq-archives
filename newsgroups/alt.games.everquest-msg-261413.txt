okay, I logged in, and I noticed the sky is changed since the last
update. None of this happened in my EQ display prior to the update.

I fiddled with my display settings, but still its all dark. When the
sun rises, it stays a large red sphere, no clouds, etc.

I've also noticed that the find path seems to be invisible,
sometimes I can see a bit of sparkles like snowflakes, but that
vanishes easily.

What adjustments do I make to my display options under the alt-o
screen to get the sky and find path back ?

Thanks,
JimP.
