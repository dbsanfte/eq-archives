PoJ maybe.  Lots of rats and things that are green to me there.  I don't 
honestly know though.  PoP was introduced when I was level 57, and I was 
able to start soloing in PoN at that level.  If you bring your own group, 
and it's a full group, you could do PoJ/PoN/PoD mobs that are relatively 
close to the zone in area.

I know that it takes me several times as many dark blue mobs in Nadox as it 
does in PoN when I solo to get the same amount of xp.
