As I understand, with summoned pets (and from checking the NG, charmed
pets, but not dire charmed pets, though I can't swear to this atm), if
you or your group does any attributed damage (even 1 point) to the mob
then you or your group gets all the experience. If you or your group
didn't do any attributed damage then the pet gets 75 percent of the
xp.

So if the mob hits you and takes damage from your damage shield that
is not attributed (in case anybody doesn't know about that).

For dire charmed pets, I understand that you or your group have to do
better than 50 percent of the damage to the mob to get all the xp else
the DC pet will take 25 to 50 percent of the xp depending on what
percentage of damage it did. If you or your group didn't do ANY damage
to the mob then the DC pet takes 75 pct of the xp.
