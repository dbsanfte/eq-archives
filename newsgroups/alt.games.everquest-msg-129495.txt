Zmag is a haven for Palestinian sympathists.  The fact that writers such as
Chomsky are well-read and quite articulate doesn't make them any less
biased, only more effective as tools of Arafat.

Amnesty International has always had a skewed view on human rights.  When I
say one-sided, I don't mean pro-palestinian.  Maybe "one-trick pony" would
be a better description.  Basically, AI denounces anything slightly
"un-nice" as being a violation of human rights, sometimes making up rights
that don't exist.

I read your cited article.  Basically AI's claims come down to three
charges:

1)  Isreal didn't tread their prisoners very nice.  Now, let's think about
this.  Here's a nation that's arresting possible enemy combatants.  No,
they're not going to treat them with kid-gloves.  Sorry, that just doesn't
tug at my heart strings.  Of course, the Palestinians, after getting off
(either justly, or because Isreal lacked evidence to hold them even though
they were guilty) go running to known sympathetic ears.  Personally, I'd
like to hear what those "degrading conditions" the captives were held in
were.

2)  Lots of dead Palestinians.  Go figure, they picked a fight with Isreal,
known to be one of the biggest bad-asses, militarily... did they not know
what the consequences would be?  Of course there are going to be more dead
Palestinians than Jews.  Isreal respons to acts of war against them by
launching military attacks on enemy combatants.  Isreal's good at this, and
manages to take out alot of combatants in each raid.  Let's not forget that
Palestinians use women and children to fight their wars, so yes, some of
them are going to die as well.

3)  Isreal gives the IDF soldiers permission to kill at will.  Let me say,
if this were the case, Palestinian death tolls would be an order of
magnitude higher, at least.

> its "legendary" to media sources who rather support their own financial

I trust for-profit media more than free media.  The reason is, in an open
market (which American media is slowly moving towards with Fox news to sever
as the only alternative to mass-media), news agencies that don't keep their
biases down will eventually be marginalized.  It's in the media's best
interest (in a free market) to provide the public with fair and balanced
news.

Now, your sites, like zmag, have no need for balance.  They don't rely on
funding from the public at large, and have no accountability to anyone other
than whoever pays their bills.  You see the potential for abuse there?

No, I read, and tossed them on the scrap heap where they belong.
