Run 2 is quite adequate for swarm/charm kiting.  Run 1 for chant kiting. 
  I never really got the hang of swarm/AE DOT kiting so I can't say 
whether you'd need to pursue Run 3 or heck, might even need to be faster 
than that.

> 2. Are there many mobs in the game that can outrun Run3?
Few, and AFAIK all can also outrun most SOW, you need Cheetah or a bard 
with a good drum to outrun the high speed griffins.

> 3. What have the experiences of other bards been like?
I happily  used Travellers Boots till getting Run, I found Run 1 to be 
barely functional but Run 2 to be all I'd ever need, and I did a -lot- 
of charm swarming.

Selos, IMO, is useful only for getting from point A to point B quickly, 
for day in and day out running around messing with the heads of mobs, 
its actually better to move slower.

Hmm, no, if I'm pulling to a group in an outdoor zone, Selos is also 
nice, for the going out and getting part.  Once I've got the mob on my 
tail though, often running that fast is a liability as I can lose the 
mob outpacing it.  I used to hit the Walk button (walking selos is a lot 
like a low level SOW) in order to not have to run stop run stop run stop 
my way home with my newfound friends.

Mental Clarity is astonishingly powerful for a bard, since your normal 
mana regen is extremely low, the effect of a little more is much larger 
than the same effect for a normal caster.

BUT to get this you'd need 6 points in your base AAs before you could 
even start to work on MC.

It would be much simpler to just get a Solstice Earring and keep leveling.
