	Wanna bet?

	They just added a symbol quest for Quellious.  These symbol quests have
been slowing appearing for each diety; the reward is an upgradable medallion
for priest classes with some (fairly minor at this point) rightclick effect on
it.  None of them have gone beyond two or three steps yet, as far as I know,
but potentially these could end up being fairly significant items.  Many
players of priest-classes want them just for the roleplaying value.

	Well, the only priest class for Quellious is Cleric, and only Erudite
Cleric at that.  So guess where all the NoDrop quest items are for the first
two NoDrop Symbols of Quellious?

	That's right!  THE WARRENS!

	Meaning that if you had the poor graces to create an Erudite Cleric of
Quellious before, say, the beginning of the month, you can't do these quests,
because you can't loot the quest items.  Yes, you could cheat and have a party
of newbies go kill the mobs while you sit on your hands -- you can't heal them
during combat, and you can't buff them because your buffs will set off the
Trivial Combat code even if cast between fights -- and then loot the items
after the newbies make the kill, but really, what a PITA.  And it's totally
against the spirit of questing in the first place.  If there is any type of
item for which the NoDrop classification is justified it is the quest item.
If your church charges you to go forth and slay the Kobold High Shaman and
bring back his amulets they mean for YOU to do it, not six guys you gave a
couple of plats to.

	You say Verant is not stupid enough to avoid breaking half the quests in
the game?  They just CREATED a broken quest, and did so not through a data
entry error or a corrupted file or a failure to export data, they did so BY
DESIGN.  As written, upwards of 95% of the PCs eligible to use this item can't
get it.

	And I'm supposed to believe that Stonebrunt and Luclin aren't going to be
riddled with these kinds of mistakes?  Pull the other one, it's got bells on.
