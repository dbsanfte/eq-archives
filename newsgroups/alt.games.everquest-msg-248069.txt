Hmm, cleric AoE stun, I see two off hand, Sacred Word, targetted AoE, so 
will hit the cleric too unless he resists, and The Silent Command, PBAE 
stun, with humongous recast time (12 second recast, 3 second stun).  That 
enchanter better not be getting much in the way of resists.  Did I miss 
one, or did the cleric just resist his own stun all the time?
