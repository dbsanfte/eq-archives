Take a look at these sites:

http://eq.stratics.com/
http://eq.castersrealm.com/
http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/everquest/eqglossary.htm

...a few, of the many available.

These contains tons of information, tips 'n' tricks, and suggestions / 
advice from others.

You can examine the pro's and con's of each race and class, then choose 
the combination that fits you. 

Ask around in the game - most people will respond to polite questions.

Have fun & Good hunting
