Well, u could have just said something bad happened with your old guild,
your post was so ambiguous.
Name and Shame, that's my moto :ï¿½)

I think it takes more than just officer status to remove a player...maybe
I'm wrong, I do have officer status but have never tried it and would leave
that decision to others, I actually only accepted the position as there were
lots of buggy zones dropping Guild Tags (like WK did last night) and one of
my characters is a Druid so it made sense to get people reinvited.
Personally, I say if they don't like the way amount you play or the fact
that you didn't drop from where you were grouped so much that they kicked
you out then you haven't lost a whole lot.
