I'm sure I could come up with a role-play reason.   : )  let's see.  not
knowing what the Gnome's god is offhand, and not knowing what potential
power the newbie gnome char would have, I'll not presume anything.

The DE wants to get the gnome to the dark-side.  he has great potential,
that his superiors told the DE to use this gnome for their own purposes.  If
he fails in his assignment, his life could easily be forfeit.  He is to
sacrifice his own arm if necessary, as that might be the cost of failure if
life isn't.

My question to you would be if that gnome would get the staff of reckoning
10000 if the DE could afford it?
