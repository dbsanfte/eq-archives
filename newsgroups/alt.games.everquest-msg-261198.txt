I've tended to do the same thing for anything that I had that would be
used situationally.  +CHA augs on my steins, and holding on to some
+resist augs for when I have a set of resist gear,  or need to worry
about it.

Accentuating your strengths tends seems to work better than trying to
cover for shortcomings, or becoming a dull shade of beige.  Works the
same in CoH, or so I've gathered from the boards (ie don't make Snipe
reload faster; it'll still suck.  Up the damage on it to do a one-shot
takedown instead)
