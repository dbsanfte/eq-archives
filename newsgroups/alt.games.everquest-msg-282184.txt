Don't mind if I do :)

I just happened to see the Ancient Cyclops while wandering around one
day in South Ro on completely unrelated business (following the dark
armies across Norrath on their way to retake Grobb). Noting it was
light blue in a zone of all greens or reds, I figured what the heck.
Held on to that ancient ring for months before going through my bank,
looking things up on Allakhazam to decide if I should keep an item,
sell it in bazaar, to a vendor, or just destroy.

My bank is a lot more empty now :) My apologies to all non-epiced
Druids out there for the number of no-drop Druid epic items I ended up
destroying. I'm sure the frustration of knowing some upstart Iksar SK
who just kills things at random just happens to come across things
you've been camping for for months or even years is maddening.

Also, thanks to all for the feedbacks and congratulatory statements.
