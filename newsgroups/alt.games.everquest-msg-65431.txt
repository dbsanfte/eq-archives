While I was waiting for a bud to page so we could start playing UT, I did 
the EQ patch, and it actually finished.

So, I said what the Hell.  I installed SP2 on my Win2k box, then installed 
DX8.1, then put the latest drivers on for my Elsa Erazor X2 Geforce2.

Cranked up EQ, and I get a black screen with an hourglass cursor ( that I 
have control of ).  It just stays there.  I left it for 15 minutes, and it 
was still there.  Never got any of the old splash screens.

Has anyone had this particular problem?

I'm new to the GeForce 2, so if there is a better place to get drivers for 
it than Elsa's site, lemme know, please.  I keep hearing things about 
"detonator drivers", but don't know what they are.

I've done a thorough file check to make sure that nothing got fubared in 
the patch, but it seemed ok.
