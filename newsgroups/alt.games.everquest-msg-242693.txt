Ok points work like this.  Lets say the spell you want is 100 points in EC.
What you have to do is get at least 100 points in that zone to buy anything
100 points or under.  It's a running total, so once you hit that point even
if you spend the points you can still buy things there for 100 or less even
using points from other zones.  What this really means is get to the minimum
in the zone you want to buy stuff in (armor, spells), then you can go to any
LDON and add to your pool of points to spend.  Hope this helps....
