I've heard this, and experimented with it, but I don't buy it.  I've 
mostly only tested it vs. failure rate, and it seems to have no effect.  
It could still affect skill raises, since my JC was already 250 when they 
added the spell line, but I have my doubts.  The theory is that IA raises 
your effective level for some purposes, mostly spellcasting purpses, and 
level is not widely thought to be a factor in any sort of tradeskilling.

I've also noticed that it doesn't seem to directly affect odds of skilling 
up casting skills.  It decreases the fizzles, but odds of a skill up per 
non-fizzled cast seems about the same.
