Actually, kitten *can* be used currently as a term of endearment 
[as kittens tend to be cute and fluffy] and I have friends who 
commonly will say Hi Kitten to a girlfriend that they have 
previously called kitten ... sort of like in german maus, 
mauschen, suessermaus, suessermauschen - mouse, little mouse, 
sweet mouse and sweet little mouse are terms of endearment.

And I have had someone say 'what's new, pussycat' to me, and that 
is using the title of a movie from the 60s/a song title from the 
60s in its proper context...and contest is VERY important.

I *highly* doubt he was using pussy in the context of a 
greeting.../eyeroll
