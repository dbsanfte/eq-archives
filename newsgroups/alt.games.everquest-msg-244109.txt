Yeah, tell me about it.  I magus-ported to the BB wayfarers camp with my
druid 16, and by the time I finished zoning I was already being beaten
up by a red-con skelly footsoldier.  I tried my magus hotkeys to port out,
but was too far from the BB magus.  So I tried to run around the camp to
get to the magus, or just to get out of camp so I could outrun the skelly.
But I got stuck in the side of one of the tents in the camp.

forward / backward / turn / forward / backward / duck / jump / yell / die...

At least it wasn't hard finding a friendly cleric to rez me, since my
corpse was already in the camp.

I noticed in some of the recent messages-while-the-server-is-loading
that they've added remarks about Norrathians becoming too smug, and
there are dark times ahead, etc.  I know that SOE tries to keep
advancing the story line, and I conjecture that the skel armies are
intended to be part of the story, but I do still hope they don't
stick around after the anniversary month.
