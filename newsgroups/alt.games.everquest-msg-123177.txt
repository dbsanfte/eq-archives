I agree.  Judging people by their actions is ok by me.  

I think the problem here is the word "class".  It tends to give me the
heebie jeebies.  It, for me, implies a certain amount presupposition.
And it seems that people who worry about "better" and "lesser" classes
never seem to be willing to put themselves in the "lesser class"
category.

But that's just me.
