No, I just think it's common sense and common courtesy that NO party should
get an insane amount of easily splittable loot.

Cleric uses 18 gems that cost 11p each.  Cleric gets, for the hell of it, 18
gems that sell to vendors for 44p each...just because he's a cleric.

(btw, I'm making up numbers but coming out with the same profit margin)

Does that sound fair to you?
