Well, here is another Skill Leveling nightmare.  I have started a Rogue,
a Vah Shir Rogue.  I enjoy doing quests and as part of the quest for
this class of kitty, I found I must bake items, I checked on the quest
and found that soon enough I would need to be a master baker.  No
Problem, i know how to do that.  Go Get a couple bags of Fish, A couple
of Bat Wings and get started.  Well, I started at the lovely beginning
level of 5 and after finishing those 320 combine attempts, I found
myself at the enviable level of 17.  Nice.  I do remember Abashi making
some claim that Intelligence was not a factor for levelling in skills so
that can not be it.  So, what can it be, a Shaman doing the same skill
leveling found that she went from 5 to 45 in the same couple of bags.
Well, these idiots make a quest dependent on us to bake yet shaft us
when it comes to how we must become master bakers.
