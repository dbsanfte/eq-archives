Because at level 65 when you need to raise some cash you can go kill the
same
things you were killing at level 40 for cash only now you can do it several
times as fast.

Also I get a lot more cash from a ldon adventure at 65 than I do with my
level 30
character. A lot more.

Also people have more idea where to go when they want to raise cash fast.
And while
levelling up I spent a significant amount of money on vendor spells, a horse
etc. I don't
need to do that any more so a higher proportion of the cash is going into
the game.

Also if the game is twice as old there is probably not far from twice as
much money in
circulation - but the number of things to spend it on has not grown in
proportion.
