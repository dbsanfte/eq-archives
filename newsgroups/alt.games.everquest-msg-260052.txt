Playing EverQuest far too much is the symptom of the disease known as
addiction.  Even if you have the willpower to "just turn it off",
chances are you'll pick up another, possibly more harmful addiction,
later.

Flexing your willpower and switching off the computer probably won't
fix what ails you.  You act like that's the cure, but IT'S NOT.  It's
a gross over-simplification, and lest someone believe your tripe, I
feel compelled to set the record straight.

If you recognize the fact that you have a broken bone, you should see
a doctor to get it fixed.  If you recognize the fact that you have an
addictive personality, you should see a doctor to get it fixed.  What
you should NOT do is think "just turn it off" will fix the underlying
problem.

The good news is most non-physical addictions can be solved with talk
therapy alone.  Your attitude that "wimpy addictions" shouldn't be
taken seriously because there are "non-wimpy addictions" is foolish.

It seems to me what you're saying is that, ultimately, a person's
mental health is their own responsibility, and for the most part, I
agree with that.  People who play EverQuest 40 hours a week, people
who gamble most of their income away, people who have sex with
multiple new partners per week -- they should all recognize their
addiction and SEEK HELP.

There is NO SHAME in finding a doctor who can HELP YOU.  It is MATURE
to recognize a problem and GET PROFESSIONAL ASSISTANCE.

Your advice to people with these "wimpy addictions" to "just stop
doing that" is BAD ADVICE.

I apologize if I'm being hard on you, but I don't want to see people's
addictions to WHATEVER continue to haunt them for YEARS because some
clueless people suggest simpleton-like answers like, "Oh, well, just
stop doing that, ya wimp."

Obviously not.
