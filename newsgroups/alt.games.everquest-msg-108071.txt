True, but if you duo or stay in a group, it's nearly impossible for them to
take any exp away unless you have multiples and are just trying to stay
alive.  I duo with my wife and the exp is amazing...we slaughter stuff at
level 27 non-stop like only my warrior with buffs has ever been able to do.

It's probably the best duoing we've done to date.  Another person on our
server started a Beastlord at the same time we did and without
powerlevelling got it to 41 in about a week, maybe two.  Normally I would
say "yeah, that person has no life" but from how we've levelled in just our
few hours of evening play, I would say if we played maybe one or two more
hours a night, we'd be in our 40's after less than two weeks.

I'm always surprised to find so few people playing Vah Shir Beastlords and
hunting Paludal.  That zone has got maybe 4x the exp bonus Lake of Ill Omen
has (that seems exaggerated...but just go try it).  We're there again
playing our newbie bards and we own the zone again.  All I can say is, okely
dokely!  We're level 9 right now, but we'll see 20 this weekend, no
powerlevelling.  A wee bit of twinking, maybe.  ;)  Actually, scratch that,
we might powerlevel a little with a 52 druid friend of ours.  But still!

Anyway, the point of my post is: don't start Vah Shir Beastlords and
ESPECIALLY don't hunt Paludal.  =)
