Oh I make no denials!  I AM a condecending asshole.

I replied to your post in the tone I did after reading post after post of
your babble, inflammatory and generally insulting crap, to people like
Graeme.

Why bother?  I mean, it can't make you look any worse than your last batch
of posts.

Woah you got me!  Sussed me out in 1 day!
I admit it, I want to be like you!  I've been trying...  want to hear a
sample?

"Did I mention I 2 box? And my shaman (who I 2box) is level 56 (nearly 57!)
along with my tweeked rogue, who I 2box.....

So anyway my rogue is the best PoP tanker!  If only you fools had maxed your
CHA, you could tank and kill as fast as me!"

How did I do? :)

You lost the plot within 1? day of being on the NG... and you call that
pretty good?

I have no sympathy at all, when you CHOSE to sit and play a fucking game
over sleep, after 48 hours of no sleep.  That isn't healthy in any
profession, but hey - you lead your life how you wish.

Maybe I haven't seen enough of the world yet.. haven't lived enough yet...
but my mind draws a blank when I think of a profession where high levels of
aggression aids and improves said job

On the contrary though, I can think of many many bad examples of
aggression.. unhappyness.. deaths.. domestic violence and abuse...

Maybe you should get out sooner rather than later then, and see about
getting some professional help to put that anger back into control.

Or maybe just sleep like a normal person, take a step back from the game.  I
play alot more than most people.. so it must be bad when I can comment on
somebody elses unhealthy play/lifestyle
