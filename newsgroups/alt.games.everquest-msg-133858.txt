Solo or duoing (or even small 3-4 people groups) I can find exp better
elsewhere

Hmm.. what old world zone has blue to 60 undead mobs?  (excluding the planes
heh).. VI has done a good job of making the manastone close to useless
(which was obviously their intent)

My CT groups have always been very high dps, I only go there with guildies
(sorry, I did my hours of "/lfg on" when I was still leveling.. not ever
happening again) and were 99% primal and better (Tunare fists and horns, 41%
haste on a lot of people etc)

It's not bad exp, like say.. Umbral, but it never seemed to me to be "godly"
exp...

I was in a 1 person 2nd floor ssra group last week, and some of them
commented on how uber the exp rate was, wheras I thought it was just average
for a full group.. guess its what your used to
