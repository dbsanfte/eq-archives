Anyone here been to the Temple lately?  Did you "see" the zone line?

On Karana, at least, you can actually see the zone line.  It's a fuscia 
object about 6-8 ( in game ) inches tall that spans the hallway where the 
zone line is.  You run over it and it zones you.  Typical programming, 
except for the part where we see it.

I wasn't the only one who saw this, everyone I talked to about it around 
the Temple saw it.  I zoned many many times this weekend doing a ton of 
quests, but never saw this error elsewhere.
