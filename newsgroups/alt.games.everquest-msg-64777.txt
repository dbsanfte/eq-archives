You should spend some time finding out why win98se won't work on your
machine.  It's a very forgiving OS.  I have three homemade boxes that  have
all run it with no issues.  I use the cheapest parts I can buy.  It sounds
like you have driver issues, XP is only going to be 100 times worse.  I did
a 98 to Win2k, GREAT upgrade but there is a lot of work involved with the
drivers.
