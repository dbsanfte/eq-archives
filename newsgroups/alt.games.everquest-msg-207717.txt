I completed the Barbarian Shaman armor in less than an hour. The quest
was very disappointing when compared to other newbie quests. All items
were tradeable thus I could have simply purchased them, no questing or
levelling involved. Two of the major components, small pieces of ore and
bone chips, took all of 3 minutes to acquire once I figured out ore
doesn't drop. Ore as far as I could determine was only available from a
vendor in Halas. I killed almost every type of mob from Everfrost to
Blackburrow and asked in ooc's and nobody online at the time had seen
them drop off a mob. Bone chips are a snap to obtain. The quest has the
appearance of a quick toss in with little or no thought involved in the
design. The Shaman armor has no WIS on any items. It has STR, STA and
HP's however, giving my Shaman a 70-90, can't remember exact amount
right now, increase in overall hitpoints. Given the extreme ease in
collecting the items, it looks like an excellent poor man's way to twink
a new char. It was the easiest and fastest newbie armor quest I have
done to date and I have done most of the others. I felt no sense of
accomplishment in completing the quest although I can say it was better
than say the Halfling Rogue quest where "Thank God it's finally over!"
was the result when completing his Tunic. All in all, a quest somewhere
between the two is much preferred, but any quest is better than none at
all. Let's see Iksar quests next!
