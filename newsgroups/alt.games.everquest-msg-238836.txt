Assuming the others who say there's nothing KOS down there are correct, get
a Gate potion and go down yourself.

How to jump and live (at least, this used to work):

Jump in.

Zoning starts.

Reboot your machine.

Start up EQ.

Enter game.

You enter game, the game looks at your current altitude *inside the Hole*,
says "this can't be right", and puts you on the ground.

I did this with a Level 1 Shadowknight a long time back.  Arrived with no
problem.  Only thing was, Master Yael was there at the time and I
immediately took 20,000 HP of fire damage.
