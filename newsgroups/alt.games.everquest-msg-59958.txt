My 55 druid has a herbie pack, my 37 dark elf has a herbie pack.

My troll sk is strong as heck, but since it carries around like 6
heavy weapons at once to max them all I figured it should get at least
the herbalists pack for the weapons. Its currently at 179 of 202 str
or something. 

So, I camp the same alcove off to the left after going into CC.. the
one with 3 or so spawns. My druid always had luck here and you can
leisurely sit in the middle and nothing hardly wanders there. This
time I'm doing it solo on my 34 sk troll though. 

I was there about 2 hours on the troll and nearly leveled to 35 (great
solo xp even for a troll sk) Herbalist did not spawn once even though
she was really killing them faster than my druid did (melee rocks
while druid was doting and medding) So I logged her out at the
entrance.

I log in tonight, and herbalist is right there as one of the first
spawns with no one around. She kills it and guess what?

No herbie pack.. no common as mud drop, no drop which is her ONLY
reason for going to CC in the first place.
Guess what she got intead? Yep, got the blackened crystalline robe
about the one time when I was NOT looking to get it to sell. How is
that for irony? Now she STILL has to camp MORE for the common as mud
pack. 

Great xp though, and I was broke anyway so selling the crys robe is
nice though no one seems to ever want to even pay 2 k for it anymore
;)
