    If you mean the Tome of Discord book, then it's up to you.  Take it to a
Priest of Discord and you become a PvP player, meaning other players can
kill you and you can kill other players.  If you mean the spell book, hang
on to it, you'll need it at lvl 9 when you get your first spells.  If you
mean your scroll then take it to your guild master.  I assume from your
statement about temple of thunder that you are in Qeynos?  I don't know
myself, as I am from Freeport and never been there, but if that is the
Paladin guild, yes.  Take your scroll to the guildmaster in there and give
it to him - good idea to do it before you die, as you will lose the scroll.
Hope this helps.
