Well there were no chanters lfg... the problem with the group though, the 51
wizard was a complete noob.  Not only did he make a very unbalanced group,
he would say stupid things.. like "chain cast stuns till the mob is at half
hp then full out nuke it"  and then he was surprised we had to pause and med
after every single pull cause the cleric was always oom from healing his
over nuking ass.

Granted my wiz has epic and he doesn't, but i was doing at least 5k damage a
fight, getting zero (or very low) agro and wasn't oom after every single mpb

Heh thats why (imo) SK's suck !!  Im too used to my monk, those looooong ass
delays when i play my SK make me think how weak he is

haha ns, it was obvious from the start that it just wasn't gonna work

Whats the dmg/delay on ur weapons?

Im not sure how well a 55 bard could charm krups/bugs in necro, but it
couldn't have been any worse then how we did (i did't stay long lol)
