Lol!  I love it.  One of my characters is a monk too, and worrying about aggroing
a security guard for a heavy pocket full of pennies doesn't sound like fun.

Grab pennies
AC drops
Guard aggros
Drop pennies to gain back AC
Kill guard
Grab pennies
Rinse and repeat.

I can see looting the guard:

Paper stein of starbucks.   Weight 0.1.  No Drop
Etched image of spouse,  Lore
Rentacop club of control,  dmg 4, delay 70.
Transceiver of the Ether.  Right click effect: /tell

Do I need a break from EQ or what!?
