Not even 30 mins these days. My necro would have made that in about 20 mins
at 45, and id guess a quadder would be even faster. (assuming KEI) Actually
considering the price essence emeralds go for on our server, I probably
missed a good chance to make some money then. Having endless free kei from
my enchanter helps the net profit too.
