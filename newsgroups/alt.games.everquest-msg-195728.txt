Sure it was out of line, way out of line, because the penalty wasn't on
the Ranger (or Paladin or SK or Bard), it was on his group!  It was the
stupidest thing they've done, bar none.  When the players found out how
xp worked, the mechanics were outed by the seq users, it became nigh
impossible for a hybrid to get a pickup group.  And at that point
Crafted was already in the game, but the Sol Ro quest armors were still
just rumors, so Paladins, SKs, and Rangers were all, to use the Chimp's
phrase, "fucked in the ass sideways with a flaming halberd".


The class xp penalties were gawdawful stupid, utterly unjustifiable.

Even at the time you speak of Rangers had poor hitpoints compared to
Warriors, slightly inferior offensive abilities, and inferior defensive
abilities.
