As a programmer I can't imagine taking this approach.

If I wanted to ensure that you never got more mana out of a pet than 
you put in, I'd simply give the pet class a new property ManaToSummon.

Set this property at the instantiation of a pet object - then on reclaim
simply use this value to compute the amount to give back.

So, I'm an evoc mage w/o SCM and no focus items (2.5%) and summon
49 Earth for 195 mana.  ManaToSummon is set to 195.  Now I reclaim
and get back .75 * 195 = 146 mana.  If I have IRE I get back .95 * 195 =
185 mana.  Now I'm a Conj spec'd mage with SCM 3 and an enshrouded veil,
49 earth takes 110 mana to summon.  ManaToSummon = 110.  Reclaim and
get back 82 mana.  IRE gets back 104 mana.
