Hello everyone,

Was wondering if someone knew where in Icewell Keep can i find Staff
Sergeant Bayard? I went thru most of it all the way to Dain and I didnt
see him, and i really want to kill him. Btw if you can get a good melee
group, Icewell is awesome. Make sure to get a warrior 55+ tho, cause if
not you wont kill much. Well you will kill but not as fast since you
will heal alot more. Everything there resist magic. You cant mez them
and they hit from 115 to 190 or so, but they give awesome loot. So
anyway, if anyone knows i would like to get the info.

Streen
Vallon Zek
