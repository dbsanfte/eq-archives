I set up all systems pretty much the same. I have eliminated the POP and the
ISP as they're fine on all my home systems. I have both ISA and PCI modems
at home here and both connect as they always have on the same ISP. Whatever
is amiss is definitely on their end. Unfortunately, they're not computer
literate at all and know just enough to crash an OS.

They tried a different ISP (MSN) which was FAR worse (as always) as it's
just sharing a UUNET POP with about fifty other ISP's and is the laggiest,
slowest POP in the area. The reason I recommend AT&T is that they have their
own POP in this area which isn't shared with any other ISP's. Not perfect by
any means, but this area is screwed when it comes to ISP's and AT&T has the
best connects and lowest ping time with very low lag.

A thought that just came to mind is that the power went out for about a day
over there and their machines were probably online when it dumped. That's
the only other thing I can think of and, if so, perhaps the modem drivers
got corrupted.

I've got one system out there that breaks all the rules. They're in BFE, 20
miles from the switch station, the line has about 5 splits running to fax
machines, answering devices, other computers and just plain hanging in the
air. Some of the lines are 25 foot wrapped up in a ball going to a phone 3
feet from the jack! Somehow, they still get at least a 48k connect and
negligible lag. If I tried *half* of that mess around here, I'd be lucky to
get a 14.4 connect! I can't figure that one out for the life of me. Heck,
they average around 5.5kbps on downloads too.
