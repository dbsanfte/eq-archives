While aggressive, even flamingly so, this seems to be an unsupported claim.
You completely ignored my reasoning as to why this is so, and act as if
laughter, the ee cummingesque use of an uncapitalized personal pronoun, a
little elizbethan copulatory reference and an oblique reference to a lack of
mental incapacity would serve as an arguement.

Prove or disprove your claim.

I say that Symbol of Kazad is really not all that important to the cleric
class.  Nice, but nothing to write home about.  All other cleric buffs are
inferior to this one, and even less important to the class.  Demonstrate
otherwise.

Did you forget to read the rest of my post, just as you snipped it out of
your reply?  I'll put it back for you, so you can see that I'm quite aware
that this isn't really true at all at the high end of the game.

FROM MY POST:
PS No, I'm not serious about the nerf or giveaway.  Pre PoP the nerf was
imperceptable, and it occured before PoP, so really it didn't change the
spell,
just the environment changed.  Pre PoP the giveaway WAS large, but it only
worked at the high end of the game, 58+ other healers were competitive with
clerics.  Post PoP, though, the cleric CHeal is better in the same way that
all
other cleric heals are better than other healer heals at the same level;
bigger
and more mana efficient.
END REPLACEMENT

3k hp heal was indeed comperable to what most cleric CHeals were hitting for
pre POP; tanks had around 5k hp and heals are timed to land before the tank
dies, so 4K heals were about par for the course, unless you had a really
tweaked out tank and were doing something so dead easy that you could afford
to let the heal go till close to the bone.

I use CHeal less and less with every expansion.  CHeal doesn't always work,
in fact more and more a CHeal means a dead tank or a lot of wasted time.  A
combination of SE and SR are often superior, and I don't even have SL to
play with yet.

Nonetheless, my point was that cleric buffs and Slow are not in the same
boat at all.  You may make a similar arguement for Slow not being in CHeal's
class... but whether thats so or not is not going to have any effect on
whether an HP buff and Slow are in the same league.
