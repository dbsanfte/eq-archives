/agree on followers, Alot of DP has hit the close to 50 range now, but we do
keep inviting lowers for Next Gen members, We find if a person is given a
chance to level a bit with other guildees(still lvl 20 minimum), we seem to
gow more as a family, every one here knows alot about each other now in game
and RL, this may not always work i understand, but with 120 members we seem
to be going strong :)
And Way A bit of useless info for ya~
