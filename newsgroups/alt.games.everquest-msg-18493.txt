Since the last patch I am suddenly having problems with EQ. I can either play
all night or for only 20 minuites at a time.  I will be playing and all of a
sudden CRASh to desktop, no GPF or Blue Screen of Death, just a clean shot down
to the desktop.  I can evern reload EQ and start again.

Here is a copy of the error from the DBG file.

I tested with my DXDiag and everything came up clean.  Any help would be VERy
appreciated as this is a most annoying new FEATURE.

My system is as follows.
   Pentium III - 850MHZ
   256MB 133MHZ Ram
   GEFORCE2 32MB Video Card made by ABIT Siluro
   Creative Labs SB Live sound card
   22GB Harddrive
   Windows 98
   I also have a CDRW, but there is no disk in it.
   The printer is turned off, as is the scanner.
