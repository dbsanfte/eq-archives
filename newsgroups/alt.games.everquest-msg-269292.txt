500/17= ~29

29 tics * 2/6 @17 mana/tic = 164
+30 mana for the spell is 194.

Very close to the 200+ you observed. (And my 29 tics is conservative 
because it assumes you were sitting at the correct time *every* time 
instead of "most of the time".

Again the numbers line up with Ben's model:
100 tics sitting 2s/6s with a 17mana/tic regen is 100*2/6*17 = 566 which 
is quite close to expected.

I expect a more rigorous test and measurements would further constrain 
the error.

Well, Ben, for mana/hp regen I'm convinced. And we've already agreed 
that for spells wearing off the tic is being used.

That leaves aggro as unresolved. You've conceded that the aggro isn't 
instantaneous but have maintained that its 'more complicated' than 
simply on the tic interval. I can live with that, although I'm confident 
that at least one important part of aggro is a periodical check at 
around a tics interval (perhaps not even in sync with the players 
'tic'), and I have no disagreement with the premise that there are 
additional 'triggers' for additional instantaneous aggro checks.
