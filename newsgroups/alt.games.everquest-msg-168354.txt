Ya we've had a lot of that too.

We had akheva crash right after a shei killing (when he dropped some sweet
sweet loot, for once) and lost it all :/
Another guild had vt crash right after killing Aten too, at the weekend.

Btw talking of camping out to "hard save" your new loot or flag.. we were
discussing this the other day after I told the loot winners to camp out
before wizzies AE Tl'd us out the zone.  A guildie was of the understanding
that it doesn't matter if you camped out, or zoned.. if you are in the zone
when it crashes, and theres a rollback, then your item is gone.

So even camping out wouldn't protect you.  Unless of course, the crash
occured whilst you were camped.

And btw, if I said the crash may have been inadvertently caused by you.....
would you know what I meant?   Reply via email if needs be..

And yeah, we were told to /report any new lootings.

/report delores would report   "--You have looted AnUberItem"  though?
