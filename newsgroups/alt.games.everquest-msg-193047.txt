Let me see if I understand you correctly:
1) you provided a pair of complementary definitions of twinking that
rely entirely on the meaning of "earn" in the context,
2) you refuse to define "earn".

It would appear that you somehow expect meaning to accrue to your
"definition" magically, out of thin air as it were.  While some
might admire your faith, I find myself wondering why anybody would
bother to make an assertion that they then insist is to remain
meaningless.  You're not in politics or used car sales are you?
