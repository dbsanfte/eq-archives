And the standard for centuries was the world was flat. Most people reading want
the content and not the posts leading up to it. Anyone can reference back if
there is some part they do not understand but that is really very few and far
between. I find it a real PITA to scroll to the bottom to read a few lines of
comment with every post prior to it quoted from top to bottom. Seems to me that
is a waste of bandwidth and the FAQs were written when there was very little
trouble with available bandwidth. Lets be part of the total solution and not the
problem.
