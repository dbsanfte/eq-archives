My biggest problem right now is just this.  She likes shopping, the zoo,
eating out, amusement parks.  

I like computers, movies, eating out (and other things
WWNNIYKWIMAITYD).  I hate shopping & amusement parks (at least the rides
I'm terrified of, really bad fear of heights)

That leaves eating out.  Makes for a very fat couple, and you can't do
it all day.
