if you are totally against anti-twinking, why even bother to create the char
on the same server?  Just pick another server to get the char up!  then you
are forced to have an even harder time twinking, unless you can get some
strange and rare across server trade to twink.  Since your totally against
twinking, you can have a clean break from all other friends / allies /
guilds between chars, which is a much better anti-twink policy that you
could self-impose.
