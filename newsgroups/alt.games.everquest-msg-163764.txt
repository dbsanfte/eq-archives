But what happens in this scenario:

Boat leaves dock as you approach.  
Cast levitate (I'm assuming a spell - am I right?  Or is it possibly a
  "right-clicky thing"?), and "stand" over the water where the boat is 
   going to come to on its return. 
Go AFK to grab a drink, eat supper, whatever.
Levitate fails (or boats break) BEFORE the boat returns/gets to your 
chosen spot.

</scenario off>

If you are AFK for a long enough period in this scenario, you come back 
to find yourself at your bind point and your body ant the bottom of the 
bay. 

Two or three things of importance here.  First, I don't have a caster 
able to lev.  Second, I don't know much about it, but I know that it 
doesn't last forever (that I have seen..correct me if I'm wrong).  And 
last, I have no clue if I spelled "scenario" correctly.

Do I have a decent point, or am I talking out my ass?  And how badly did 
I screw up my spelling?
