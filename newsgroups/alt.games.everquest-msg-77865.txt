I'll bet you have your clipping plane set to max.  Crank it
down some.  Either use the slider in Options/Display, or
while playing use shift-<minus sign> to lower it (one notch for
every time you hit shift-<minus> until it bottoms out, or
shift-<plus sign> to increase it.

The clipping plane (which has been in EQ for years) is
the "brute force Umbra" -- it simply tells the game not to bother
rendering anything that's more than a certain distance
away from you.  Cranked to maximum, you can see for "miles".
Cranked to minimum, and you can barely see across a big room.
Somewhere in the middle you'll find a happy medium between
good visuals and decent framerates, especially in big, complex
zones.
