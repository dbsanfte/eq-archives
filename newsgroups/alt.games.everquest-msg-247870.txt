Caveat, everything I mention here pertains to Windows XP Pro only) I
used to get that type of freeze before and the single click did work.
now the mouse pointer seems to bounce all over, then I get control, and
all is workable until the char selection screen appears. The pointer is
frozen in the upper left corner as I mentioned, Alt-Enter does not work,
Ctl-Alt-Del doesn't work, only rebooting the system works.... Win98SE =
No problems at all.
