No no no no no no no no no!

Druids can't solo at all!  Quad kiting is very mana intensive, and it's much
preferable to solo like a paladin (melee until you've got only one bubble of
health, one bubble of mana, and burn your LoH trying to get out of dodge,
try again in another hour... less if you didn't make it, and are bound close
by).  Geeze, what are you thinking?  Why, my level one monk can solo six
old-world dragons in about ten minutes, only four Kunark level dragons,
though.  Hell, my level five enchanter can MT Greig.  I swear, druids'
soloabilty is a myth, just like that phoney "Atom Theory" (protons,
neutrons, and electrons, who buys this stuff).

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
