When you say "armor that I have equipped" I can't be positive it works,
as I haven't done it, but it may work the same as a general inventory
slot. I keep my jboots in the last inventory slot at all times, and all
my banks of hotkeys have that dragged into the number ten position. You
do this by clicking and holding on the inventory slot until a button
pops up, then you slide over and place it in your hot keys. This way, no
matter which bank of hot keys I have active, I only need to hit the zero
on my keyboard and my jboots refresh. I imagine you could do the same
for an armor slot, but you'd have to try it to be sure.
