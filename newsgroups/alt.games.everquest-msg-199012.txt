The hate resulting from a weapon hit appears to be proportionate to
the amount of damage plus a constant.  I have seen this in action
having to use Stun to hold agro with my Paladin even when outdamaging
somebody else who was using poor ratio fast weapons (i.e. they were
not outdamaging my high ratio 2-hander).  I don't think anybody has
managed to quantify this constant, but I'm not alone in observing it.
It is possible this constant is just an illusionary byproduct of hate
"decay" (hate fades over time), depending on how decay is implemented,
but since decay probably occurs on the "tick" (every 6 seconds) that
seems an unlikely explanation to me, it just isn't fast enough.

In your case, that 34/35 (rec level 53, right?) 2-hander is generating
a lot more damage than the Lamentation + Jade Mace combo, I'm not too
surprised that it nets more agro.  A year ago you would likely have
had nothing better than a 42/49 (Argent Protector), less damage and a
_lot_ slower, which your dual weapons will out-agro.  So to some degree
you're reporting a case of "common knowledge" being a bit behind the
times, the WBGS is fairly new.

The other disadvantage to using a 2-hander as MT, besides less agro
than a dual combo that produces similar damage, is that it can be
harder to (re)solidify agro in a situation where you have to Taunt to
(re)gain it, a few consecutive misses with a slow weapon takes a lot
longer to get past than the same with a pair of fast weapons.

There's a shovel or somesuch that is a 30 delay 2hb.  And I've seen
faster ones as well, but they're more rare.
