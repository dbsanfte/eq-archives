Affliction Haste 2 affects spells with a 2.0 cast time, tho obviously
only spells 44 and under.  My Druid (L33) now sometimes mems both of
his snares because Ensnare (cast time 1.8) is not made faster by his
Chrysoberyl Talisman, so Snare (2.0) is now my fastest casting "ack!"
spell (1.3 with focus).
