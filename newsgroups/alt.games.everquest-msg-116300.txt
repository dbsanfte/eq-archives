Microsoft is doing exactly what all dominant market share leaders do
in all forms of business. 'Ethics' is a fast and loose term in the business
world. The ruthlessness of MS didn't get them to the top but it will keep
them there a bit longer.

Then in other words it doesn't matter. Obviously their distasteful business
practices are not enough to stop you from using their product. So therefore
Microsoft will continue to dominate since everyone, including yourself,
doesn't really care about their 'distaseful' business practices.

Catch-22. If no one uses Linux or any other OS product then Microsoft
will continue to be the defacto standard.
