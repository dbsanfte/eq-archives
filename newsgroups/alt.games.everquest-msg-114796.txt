So if you JUST DINGED level 15 and die a dozen times you remain level 15 but
have to MAKE UP that xp PLUS normal level 15 xp before getting to 16?

Or is it ala DAOC where you simply cannot delevel...where as soon as you
ding you can do anything or go anywhere you like because there's no penalty
except time if you die (with or without gear...obviously you'd go naked if
you were likely to die and lose gear)?

Either way, that's a hell of a lot of BRAND-NEW coding if they wanted to
implement that in EQ(1), rich with brand-new bugs.
