I really, really got scared when I read this.  I can see this working for
Divine
Aura and spells of that ilk.  What's going to happen, though, when Zlandicar
realizes that he's being auto-riposted by a warrior or 100% dodged by a
rogue (although if you're using that instead of Duelist while fighting
Zlandi,
we need to talk ;-)  ).  I REALLY just hope this means from stuff like PGT
proc or ShinyBrassIdol/Divine Aura effects.

What the heck is the point, then? "Magiman, you stand at the gate of
Permafrost
and watch my health..."
:-)

See new "Bestest Friend" faction adjustment, one step above Ally...and
Tormax
won't give quests unless you're one step above that..."Drinking Buddy."

Wonder if they come out of the cannibal dragon's belly...

YAY! YAY! YAY!  Now just fix it so that "hide" isn't seen by "See
Invisible."
"Hide" isn't a spell, it's a skill...I'd like to think that at a skill of
200 I could actually
hide from a level 8 wizard...
:-)
