In a filter I did for a chat server, I avoided that problem by having 
two word lists: the list of bad words, and a list of known good words.
All the known good words in a /tell where marked as protected by the 
filter, and bad words were only flagged if they did not overlap anything 
that was protected.

So, in your example, my filters would see that "but", "I", and "told" 
are in the known good words, and so would mark those letters as all 
protected, and so the "tit" in there would not be filtered.
