If you're only twinking, and not having a Druid PL you, then the
scenario you suggest will happen to <some> degree, but not too terribly.
The player's various melee skills will probably lag behind an untwinked
person a bit for the first, say, fifteen levels or so. But by the time
you get up into your twenties, the skills go up more slowly anyway, and
you have to fight a lot more mobs to make a level, so they'll likely
catch up and even out in the end.
