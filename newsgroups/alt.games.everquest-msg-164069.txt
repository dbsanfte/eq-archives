Thanks everyone for the responses. I got a lot of good info Im going to try.
To answer some of the questions and comments:

1. All who said to write Verant and EULA about getting him banned for
selling.
>Good Idea, Im going to see what I can do. Ive tried having the account
suspended but they wont do it.

2. As far as not getting the character back and thats the risk.
>True, Ive already accepted the fact about not getting the char back. But I
would like to get my money back even though thats not even that big of a
deal. I just want him not to have it. I dont care if it cost me $1000 to get
back $450.

3. Contacting fraud people, paypal, credit card, playerauctions, etc.
>Playerauctions would only dissable his account which seems useless to me
since he can just get a different one.
>Paypal said sorry its more then 30 days they wont help
>I filed a complaint at the fraud agency
>Im in the midst of filing a small claims suite against him. Then if he
doesnt pay turning it over to collections.
>I have a lawyer drafting a letter.

4. Not being a binaries group
>Yea that was an accident, I copy and pasted and I guess the face pasted as
a binary face. No excuse, my apologies.

5. "He should refund your $450 and explain his actions to you"
>I would even be happy if he just explained his actions and kept the $450. I
just find it very odd that he would take back the account, pay the
subscription, but not use it??? Why pay for something, hurt someone else,
create a hassle for yourself, and then not even use it. Wierd.

6. "Although as someone else mentioned your post here is highly beneficial
anyone who reads it is unlikely to make your mistake."
>This is one of my hopes.

7. "Tough titties."
>ROFL thanks, that made me crack up hehe.

8. "Post your story on server boards."
>Done :)

In all thanks for the positive comments and good ideas.
