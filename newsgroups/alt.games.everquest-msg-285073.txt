Not entirely true.  You need to know how to heal if you play a cleric in 
the Dain missions, for example.  You don't need to be able to play an EQ 
PC Cleric, but you need to know how to play a cleric that can handle 
aggro, use long casting big heals, etc.

Well, considering the number of people who do lose, I'm not sure that's 
accurate.  You need to be able to work as a team, co-ordinate, 
communicate and use your skills.

Doing the same mission over and over is as boring as hell, just like 
anything, but doing the missions for the first time, or a few times to 
help friends can be fun.  Doing the Rivervale zombie mission was some of 
the best fun I ever had in EQ.  Brraiiiinnnnnnnssssssssssssssss.

Monster Missions are another aspect to EQ, which some people enjoy, some 
hate, some abuse and some ignore.  But they can be fun, entertaining, 
low entry requirements, and a good way to pass a set amount of time with 
people you may or may not know.

The only real problem is that in a lot of cases, because people are 
farming them for XP or a specific drop, they learn the 'quickest' way to 
beat the mission, and then just do it over and over and over, and they 
may well invite others and not communicate the slightest bit of 
information to them, and just run through the steps.  That's a problem 
with people, not monster missions.

Do the Naggy mission in Lavastorm and listen to the people 'raiding' him 
crying out when they die - it's hilarious.
