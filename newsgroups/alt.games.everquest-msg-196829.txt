Yes and yes.  The limitation on all the Affliction focus effects is
that they only apply to DoTs that last more than 30 seconds (i.e.
low level Enchanter DoTs are not helped).  Affliction Efficiency
gives a 20% reduction in mana cost, IIRC (compare to 10% for Mana
Preservation).  Affliction Haste (Chrysoberyl Talisman has AH 2) is
a 33% reduction in casting time for DoTs (minimum affected casting
time varies with level of effect I think, AH 2 works on casting
times of 2.0 seconds or higher).  Affliction Extension gives +20%
duration.  If you decided you wanted the Talisman for Affliction
Haste you would want to do the Fine Antique Ring quest to replace
your BAM's Mana Preservation 2, easy quest, all parts are droppable
I've done it for less than 10pp with a L4 once (found a very cheap
HQ Cougarskin).

Sadly, the Affliction focus items no longer work on Slows, Roots,
and Snares.  :(  Still, you're 29 now, you could do the "Fine Cut,
Inlaid Diamond Mask quest" for a decent lowbie Spell Haste 2 face
item (has 3 wis, 3 ac, and 10 mana/hp IIRC, unimpressive by your
standards, but wearable and something you could quest yourself,
just need Invis, a Sarnak Blood, and a willingness to run through
a dungeon full of goblins who want to eat you).

Drakescale Belt is poor armor (ac5, no stats) but it does have
Extend Enhancement 2 (adds 20% to buff durations), which works
on Regen and Haste as well as more ordinary buffs.

Moonstone Ring has crappy stats (30mana) but has Extended Range 2
on it, which lets you pull and rot from further away, sometimes
useful.

Discount focus items have helped me continue killing red mobs into
my mid-30s (so far) with my Druid on FV who has never had KEI.
