Forgot where I found this table but its been pretty accurate
for me:

   [Assuming "Indifferent" starts at an arbitrary 0]:
    -??? -751    ...scowls at you, ready to attack
    -750 to -501    ...glares at you threateningly
    -500 to -101    ...glowers at you dubiously
    -100 to   -1    ...looks your way apprehensively
       0 to   99    ...regards you indifferently
     100 to  499    ...judges you amiably
     500 to  749    ...kindly considers you
     750 to +xxx    ...looks upon you warmly
    +xxx to +???    ...considers you an ally

Basically you just need to keep going. Faction work is just that, work.
