Its a marketing ploy, pure and simple. Basically all that can mean is
that they are going to optimize some things that pentium 4 or any
class pentium chip does. AMD's athalon procs are pretty much totally
pentium 4 compatible. I'd get which ever you can get the most bang for
you buck with and right now that's athalon for my money.

I believe the AMD products luclin had trouble with are the older AMD
chips, not the athalons.

This is kind of an advertising/marketing deal that sony EQ has with
pentium 4. More than likely it all comes down to meaning that intel
gave sony EQ a bunch of pentium 4 chips or servers or something for
sony EQ to blurb about the pentium 4. That kind of thing is pretty
common.
