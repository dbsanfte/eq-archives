Well my only evidence for meditate is personal....I have with a number of
characters scribed and memmed a spell of the same level both before and
after putting a point of training to med.....the difference was always
extremely noticeable. The problem I see with splitting the two things out 
(ie level based improvment or med skill based improvement) is that med
tends to go up in line with level and doesnt increase much by level once
established.....scribing always is the long issue.
