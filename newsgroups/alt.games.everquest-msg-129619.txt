Go back to Glox, say "I am ready for the test of agility", then you'll be in
the room, die near the door, then drag it through the door when you come
back.

Hmm.. thinking about it, you could go down there on your 49 monk, kill him,
let the 12 monk loot corpse and use the potion out (that drops off glox),
then use an expendable newbie to spawn glox down there again while your 49
monk kills him a second time and loots the potion to get out.
