Changing the wording slightly from Lok's post, for god's sakes don't buy the
poor-excuse-for-toiletpaper guides.

I prefer www.eqmaps.com over her suggestion but if I can't find it at one I
do go to the other.

The newbie lift is just about a 10 second run down the path from the POD
lift.  It's the closest lift to the newbie area and at the top is the
closest vendor...who happens to also sell food & milk.

As soon as you have 7 or 8 gold (depending on your CHA) buy your first
backpack.  There's a vendor in the bard guild (off the platform between the
newbie and POD lifts).  There's probably a few other vendors but that's the
easiest one to point you to.  In fact, most class guilds have a vendor who
sells containers.

Orcs and skeletons are the prime critters to kill...orcs can drop clothing,
containers, & weapons, and skels can drop weapons and bone chips.  Bone
chips are great for selling to other players or for doing a paladin quest
based in Kaladim (dwarf town).  Great experience at low levels.
