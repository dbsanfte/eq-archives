I'm sure I'd enjoy LDoN too, if I could find a group. The only LDoN
adventure I've been on, we had two druids and no tanks. Even I knew it
was a bad idea and doomed to failure, but I was keen to go, and
there's no way I was going to bail on the group after all the times
I've had people bail on me. And despite the fact that we didn't
complete our mission, I had a good time.

Too bad I paid all that money for just one adventure.
