I never said that YOU were the one to mention copyright and/or EULA.  Your
post insinuated that there was a breach in either or.  Though, now with the
introduction of a NDA, which up until now neither myself nor my guide friend
never even heard of.  (we know what a non-disclosure agreement is, just
incase there is any unjust doubt)

What NDA?  Perhaps you are assuming that the guide in which this P&P was
acquired from signed a NDA.  It would make perfect sense for a NDA to exist,
however, I am being assured that this guide signed no NDA what-so-ever
(either verbally, electronically, hand written or hell even by proxy) as I
type this reply.

What agreement?  I'm morally outraged that you assumed that an agreement
exists or existed at the time that this document was given to a guide.

So you are assuming again that only ignorant inexperienced users would or
would not use this for either their benefit or educational purposes?

You are right.  I should'nt have posted what I knew to be the full and
accurate P&P that guides use.  I should have just talked out of my ass, made
a bunch of stuff up, then that would have made things really interesting for
guides.

Its obvious its your opinion that making this guide available to the general
public is going to hinder the efficiency of the guide program and/or
petition queues.  That is YOUR opinion in which you are entitled, which I
respect because my "morals" tell me that it is just that, YOUR opinion.    I
cannot control whether or not you feel the same way, though, just how you
feel about this entire situation is quite obvious.

Woohoo.  Wow.  Another display of your "morals."  Could you have called
someone an "idiot" any better than this?  Sure you could have, you could
have had a pair and said it outright.  (too late now)  I will make this the
last message of yours I reply to within this thread and know that I have
gone all this way without making insults to anyone.

To recap for you.  "...oh nevermind..."   I suppose I could have made two
entirely seperate paragraphs from the one being made reference to, but, I
didn't.

Perhaps you quote everything that is said, while making comment to such
quoted text for the sybaratic joyance of quoting.

In other words, "dont take this topic so damned seriously."  High blood
pressure can lead to hemorrhaging of the brain.  Enjoy life, its too damned
short as it is.  Though, thats just a suggestion, nothing more.  (<--
disclosure incase you would want to insinuate that Im ordering you around
now)
