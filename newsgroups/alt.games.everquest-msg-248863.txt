As opposed to before, where this type of player would have gone to Ill omen
to 30, Overthere to 40, Dreadlands to 50, Maiden's Eye to 60, seen only five
zones and learned nothing other than how to handle single pulls in safe
outdoor zones.

LDoN didn't create this problem, the players themselves did.
