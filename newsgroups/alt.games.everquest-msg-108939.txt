It -is- such simple math.  It seems to me impossible that these people 
cannot see that same math... So after careful thought, I figured out where 
the math is so simple that it is wrong.  It is possible, at a wide range 
of levels, to get something useful done in butcherblock.  There's plenty 
to hunt for exp or faction, although the loot is, on average, pretty 
pathetic.  So... it's possible the shouting party is in no real hurry to 
get to WC, but would very much like to not waste 30 minutes on a boat.

3 hours shouting plus hunting, followed by a port = no time wasted.

Taking the boat at the outset = between 15 and 30 minutes wasted, 
depending on how long you have to wait for the boat.

Still, I usually just take the boat. :)
