You do know the second M stands for multiplayer? I fail to see how
anyone can buy a multiplayer game and then complain they have to play
with other people.

Anyway I've done newbie island about 8 times now and never had any
problems finding a group. The best way to find one is so set the LFG
tag and stand outside the orc cave. Plus be proactive and ask people if
they want to group.

The reason you have to group to kill him is because 'grouping' is
part of the tutorial which is the point of newbie island. If you could
solo him you wouldn't have learnt how to group before leaving the
island.
