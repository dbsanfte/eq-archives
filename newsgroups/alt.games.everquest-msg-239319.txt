Actually, with a high enough ATK you can get a larger spike at max
hit than at magic number, depending on the AC of your target of
course.  See:
http://pub148.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessage?topicID=19301.topic

So the best formula to use would be based on the average hit your
character gets, easily learned by using most any parser on a combat
log (unless you are a dual wielder with identical damage type on
both weapons, then you might need to set up a specific trial).  You
would want to parse the conditions you care about the most in terms
of buffs and target AC to get the most useful multiplier for your
character, it can vary a lot (to give an extreme example, my L56
Paladin gets a much higher average hit on Orc Pawns than on L50
LoY minor nameds).

For Kaev, a Bazaar geared L56 Paladin with no +ATK gear, STR near
150 unless buffed (not often), and rarely any +ATK buff other
than Grim Aura from his earring, the 2.0 works well (it's very
close to my average hit in mid-50s LDoN normal adventures). Romidar,
the L65 Paladin who posted parse results at the above link got a
modal of nearly 6*base+bonus with Ferine Avatar which clearly pushes
his average hit _way_ beyond 2*base+bonus.  Highend melees with lots
of worn +ATK can do even better.

I've no idea what, for instance, a L65 Monk with maxxed worn ATK,
maxxed STR, and raid buffs averages.

Anyhow, if you're "casual" and under 60 a 2.0 multiplier should
be an ok rule of thumb.  Beyond that there're an awful lot of
variables as far as gear, buffs, and targets.  But I'd probably
use at least a 2.5 and maybe a 3.0 multiplier for a L65, even if
you don't have the STR and +ATK now, you're gonna likely acquire
it over time.
