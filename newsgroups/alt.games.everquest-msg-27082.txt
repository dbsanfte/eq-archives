I balanced it by selling the brew, and buying Honey mead, and pouring
that down Trumpy's Throat.  I'm Mid dubious with corrupt right now, and
thats as low as I want to go.   I'm thinking I might make a suicide
bank, and run some pouches from The Rat finsk to Crow.  There is little
to no cash loss and IIRC no faction losses.
