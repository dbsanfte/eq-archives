Then why not take a Ranger ? Much better utilities than a Berserker,
and he is closer to a Warrior in his skillset(Dual wield).
Up to the mid-fifties a Ranger is by far the easiest class to make
*real* money and xp,seems to fit well to the OP's needs,if he is not
planing to play the high(er) level game.
Not that I am prejudiced.  :)
