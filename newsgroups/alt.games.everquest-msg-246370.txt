Heh.  "HazRat" on the Virtue server is a Defender... with Radiation for both 
power sets.  Though more fragile than a scrapper or a tanker, my science-
origen ratwoman handles solo fights pretty well.  Pick one in the group, make 
him the source of a radiation infection that weakens him and every other 
baddie around him, then pick another and start throwing out the neutrino rays 
and, if they get close, a few punches.  At level 5 I've got a healing power 
(though you'd have to be close to me for it to effect you) and one that 
boosts stats of me and people around me.  As a side effect, radiation powers 
lower the enemy's defense.  >:)

I have a fondness for animal people and it's been interesting working along 
that theme.

On Virtue:
The Masked Hyena (Science Tanker -- Invulnerability/Fire)
Iggan (a transformed lion) (Magic Scrapper -- Dark/Dark, mwahahaha)
The Brown Hyena (Mutant Scrapper -- Dark/Regen)
Shadow Rat (Magic Blaster -- Ice/Fire)
The Plaguerat (holding the name, not playing the character)
HazRat (Science Defender -- Radiation/Radiation)

I think for the next one I'm gonna try a Natural Scrapper, chick with a big 
sword.  :)  I like playing with the different origens, seeing how the various 
quests go.  Only one I didn't like was Technology... bastards kept steering 
me to fight Clockworks.  I hate Clockworks.  And not in a good way.  :P
