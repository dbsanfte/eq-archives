51 Barbarian Shaman here.

The number one reason NOT to be an iksar is they cannot use the JBB. The
usefulness of the bracer is just crazy. I went from 46-50 in about 2 weeks
soloing with the JBB. Other than that iIksar shamans are nice.

Troll's are good as the regen helps but is not a huge issue at later levels
as shamans get the regen line of spells and have access to regen items. Also
if you like to solo you will be melee'ing alot. I was going toe to toe with
stuff until level 45 which trolls and ogres will have an advantage. I would
say if I had to restart my shaman I would choose a troll :) oh.. Trolls can
get a necklace which has a engulfing darkness type effect which no other
shaman can get.
