Skilling up to 191 on patty melts is boring but at least you can read a book
while you do it. Click combine, autoinv hotkey, repeat, you can be on the
phone, watching tv, almost asleep at the keyboard, it doesn't matter.

Brewing is fiddly in terms of restocking inventory (lots of ingredients) but
getting to 200 in halas is a doddle.

Archery in abysmal sea , and i think shadowhaven as well and surefall, and
not that expensive.

Tailoring has cost me blood, sweat, unrezzed deaths, much harassment from
other players and endless bitching and arbitration by guides because the
major ingredient for most of it is flawless hides, and farmers know it, and
harvest the one cave system they can readily be found almost all the time,
then sell them for 500 plat each. I'm 220 or around there, and at 242 i
intend to skip DSP forever for any of my characters.

Smithing is easy i am told if you farm velium bits and have a 50+ enchanter
ready. I actually skilled up on banded many years ago and topped making
plate and shawl armor, which has sat in my bank waiting for the day i join a
guild again (hahaha).

Fishing is like baking, only you need backpacks of bait, and that summoned
fishing rod (another good quest?), and standing in PoG fishing/foraging
works well, but forages can max fishing and make lots of money in a lot of
zones, especially if you process foraged goods eg misty thickets, lucky
cabbages, dyes, etc. Money, skillups, mana regen, and a chance of nice
scenery and the occasional ganking by a legendary griffon if it's an event
and you get complacent.
