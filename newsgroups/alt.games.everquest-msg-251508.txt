There's a Murphy's Law sort of thing for newgroups which states that any 
grammar flame will contain grammar errors, and any spelling flame will 
contain spelling errors.

certainly to remember it.

However, I already see the grammar error in my post, can't spot the 
spelling one but its probably there somewhere.
