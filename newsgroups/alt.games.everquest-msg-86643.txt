Scaled Mystics (shaman guild)
Brood of Kotiz (necro guild) (unlike Brood of Di'Zok which is sarnak guys)
Crusaders of Greenmist(SK guild/SK guards (Crusaders)
Legion of Cabilis (Warrior guild/most other guards)
Swifttails (monk guild, and ONE rogue guard somewhere)
Cabilis Residents (I believe most of the merchants on this one)

Man, your friend must have done some serious slaughtering of outcast iksar
to get non-kos to the necros.
And not done that many bone chips if he's still kos to SKs.  Or something
like that... considering bone chips raise Scaled mystics, crusaders of
greenmist, legion of cabilis (which isn't kos anyways if you're doing the
quest), swifttails and cabilis residents.
