Been there... done that...  I play a druid as well.  Druids aren't suppose
to be primary healers, they have heals, but they have other spells.  They
are more Jack of all Trades type Wis Casters than a Healer.  Shamans are
DoT specialists, but they also have healing abilities.  So you are telling
me... Clerics are unbalanced because they get better direct heals than
Druids and Shamans?  Hello...

too)

Again... HELLO...  From 29 to 51, Druids and Shamans are less likely to be
needed for healing.  By 29, Druids have group Porting spells.  Dunno what
it is for Shamans, but I think when they hit 34 or 35, they get their
spirit Wolf pet.  At these levels, you start seeing Druids and Shaman
soloing more and not be primary healers.  In groups where I did group, and
was primary healer, we took breaks to slow down, but I also kept Regen up
during those down times so the heals wasn't as important.  And while Regen
is slow, it beats the hell out of constantly healing and medding.
