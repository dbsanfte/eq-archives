That's not how tax brackets work.  If you're "in" tax bracket X, your
entire income isn't taxed at that rate; only the portion of your income
which exceeds the next lower bracket.

For example, given these hypothetical tax brackets:

Income       Tax Rate
--------     --------
   0-20K      12%
 20K-35K      15%
 35K-50K      19%
 50K-70K      23%
 70K-85K      28%
85K-100K      35%

If you earn $100K, you pay 12% tax on the first $20K earnings, 15% tax on
the next 15K earnings, 19% on the next 15K earnings, and so on.

The entire 100K is not taxed at the 35% rate.  If it were, someone who
is at the upper end of their bracket and gets a small raise thus pushing
them into the next bracket would be screwed, as they now pay a LOT more
tax than they did before the raise.

(As an interesting side note, this is why the original hell levels existed.
When you dinged enough to get into a higher experience "bracket", the new
exp rate was retroactively applied to all your previous levels, creating
a huge deficit.)
