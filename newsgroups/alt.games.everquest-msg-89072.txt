rangers... I'm not sure, as I havent played them, but there is this hill
giant in OOT named Gornit. He is normal HG levels (I forgot but something
like 32-38) and if im ever going by and hes not camped i just take him cause
im bored... drops normal HG loot, up to 40pp and sometimes a FS weapon. also
good thing to do while reading books, but he has kind of a short spawn
time... like I said, I havent played a ranger before, so give it a shot.
Sharing isnt worth it, you can probably make more money killing stuff in
south karana than that
