I think you may been learning why they are *not* as powerful as some
people seem to think.  People spend a lot of time decrying the massive
DPS a necro can do on top of their other utility functions but they
forget that this massive DPS isn't instantaneous.  Even if agro isn't
an issue, it takes time to get the DOTs on the mob.  If the rest of
your group is already doing good DPS, the necro won't actually add as
much as you might think because the mob dies before you really get to
shine.

Good plan, but you can't always live by it.  Sometimes you are FM and
(nearly) FH and the best way to add DPS is just to hit the mob with a
lifetap because it will be dead in 15 seconds anyway...

As an aside, stand when you send your pet.  Sitting while sending pet
will bring the mob right to you in a lot of cases.  You may already
know this but I learned the hard way "growing up" as a necro.

I typically feign and then get right back up or feign until the mob is
hit by one tic of the DOT damage and then stand.  Adjust how long you
stay down depending on effect.

Consider nukes and DD lifetaps if DOTs are just completely pointless,
which they can be in some situations.

No I think you are just experiencing one of the natural limitations of
the Necromancer, (as possibly intended by the devs) one which many
people discount when they explain that Necros are too powerful.

At the endgame you will find lots of groups where red-con mobs last 30
seconds or less.  In fact you make find it more often there than
anywhere else, but it depends on who you are grouping with, how well
they play, and how they are equiped.

Well this can help but then you start worrying about resists as well...
