What he is asking for is a message to say server's are down (then maybe a
message to check www.everquest.com for network status) and not that the
login server is congested or unable to log on try again later, which leads
you to believe that the servers are up just busy. I get thess messages when
I know damn well the servers are up (because my other PC is still logged in)
but it takes several attempts to get on (whether this is Verant, Alter.net
or my ISP I have no clue so won't pass out any accusations)

I agree with him, it'd be nice to know if the servers were down (for
whatever reason, it happens) or just congested at which point you know you
can expect to get on just may take 5mins.
