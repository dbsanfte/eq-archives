You can probably get 8-10K for it, don't undersell yourself.   Well,
depends on the server I guess, old servers tend to have absurd prices
(thanks dupers and quest exploiters) so on one of them 8-10K.

Best thing to do, though might be to just /auction Taking offers on
Iksar Berzerker Club.  Don't jump any to any deals, and let those
you're dealign with know you're not going to rush in - if they're
serious, they'll be open for a little wheeling and dealing.
