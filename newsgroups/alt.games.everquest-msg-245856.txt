In both of them, they have changed a lot the way EQ is played. You are 
playing in "secure" dungeons where other groups get no access, so no camp 
takeovers or other raid parties getting the uber mob before your raid.

However since the LDON realease, I would say 60% of all grouping is 
happening in these dungeons, so go for LDON to get groups quicker.

Yes LDON released some new stuff, some of them good some of them bad, the 
major change is augments. Nodrop stones with stats like +5 STR etc. which 
can be melted with your equipment.

GoD get it when you get to 60 or near. You can go to GoD dungueons from 52 
(afaik!), but they are hard and mostly for raid parties. However the drops 
there can be really ï¿½ber.
