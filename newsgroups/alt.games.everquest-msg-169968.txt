Yup.

You should recover HP at the same rate as if you were sitting, assuming 
you are standing still on your horse. Mana rate is actually given a 
bonus on a horse- again, you must be still.

Horses are great for when sitting = aggro = instant dead you. All the 
benefits of sitting without actually sitting. The other bad things about 
horses: the horse's head in your view from 1st person, the difficulty of 
trading and some buffs landing inconsistently, and the lack of duck 
being there to interrupt spells. But these inconveniences are worth it 
for hunting in POP and in tight raid situations.
