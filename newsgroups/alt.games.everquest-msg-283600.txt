Well I was away for a while but decided to start playing again. After a 
long download on both my systems I noticed I needed to get DX9.0c so I 
went and downloaded the april one. Well one system ( my crappier one btw 
) will launch np, the better one downloads but never "auto plays" and 
the box always says "download". If I click it again it downloads for one 
sec, says complete but still nothing...any thoughts?
