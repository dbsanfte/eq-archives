lol... did that once.  Warrior and I couldn't find anyone to port us (Qeynos
was and still is a nearly-empty zone), so we ran.  We had a small problem
crossing Kithicor at night... I cast Invis to Undead on him, but a wolf
aggro'd him, then the nearby undead beat him to a pulp.  It was fun trying
to find his corpse and get him a rez - I couldn't yet rez folks myself.

Ah, memories...

Woot... always fun to be a part of.

Lots of those recently.

Wow... way-nice drops for the average Naggy raiding force.

Hehehehe.  I guess that's one way to do it.  =)

On Drinal, US is usually perma-camped 24x7, so it's hard to believe that the
monk went up and found it empty.  Then again, I haven't been to Velk's much
since PoP came out, so for all I know everyone's in the planes now, getting
XP.

=)  Those ramps are fun to navigate.  When I was on my 59-60 push (long
before PoP came out), I spent *soooo* much time in that zone.  You gotta
fall on your noggin a few times before you learn where to run, where to
jump, and where to barely inch forward.

Upper Dogs.  That's where I spent the majority of my time in Velk's.  Lots
of VT loot there, it's nice.

Jerks indeed.  And all-to-common behavior in Velk's.

That's way nice of him.  Too many people sneer at pally rezzes but I have no
qualms taking one, especially in difficult situations.

That's terrific.  Knowing where to find good grouping buddies is very
important.  Before I joined my current raiding guild, I had lots of friends
I could call on to group.  We'd go tear apart Dragon Necropolis or
Cazic-Thule or deep, deep Chardok and have lots of fun.  I miss that now
that it's all raid-raid-raid.

That's called PLA (Phat Lewt Area) on Drinal for no good reason at all.

You don't know how many hours and hours I spent in Seb trying to get an ODS
to drop.  Finally, when I was doing an AE group there, we got one to drop.
It was randomed off and, on a 200-500 roll, I scored a 498.  I'm still
wearing it.  Your group was very fortunate to get one... too bad you
couldn't profit off of it, Zymool.  This is one case where I'd support Need
Before Greed, because that item is *so* useful to caster types.

Get into a Guardian group in Seb if you wanna see lotsa cash gems and stuff.
I used to make most of my plat there, once upon a time.

> We rotate 4r again, and no nameds.

I did a few PLA groups and only once did a named pop, dropping some uber SHM
loot that I can't remember the name of (JBB?).

Sounds like you got lots of loots, both good and bad.  It truly was PLA for
you.  =)

OMG!  This is the point where I would repeatedly bonk my head against the
desk.

Uh oh.

>  She says "oops" and joins back up and hands the box over.

Oh, good.  =)

Wow.  Three emotional swings in less than a minute.  Must have been an
exciting time for the cleric.  =)

Lodizal is pretty easy, it's simply a matter of killing him before anyone
else does.  Used to be, people had his spawn time calculated with a fair
degree of precision and the area would be swarming with high-level types
just before he was due to pop.  Maybe that all changed with PoP.  That
wouldn't be a bad thing.  =)

No ninja-looting, no huge /ooc flamewars over who gets what?  That was an
exceptional Lodizal kill.  =)

Hehehe.  One of the joys of being a cleric is saving someone who is about to
die.  The fact that you may have put them in that position is irrelevant.
=)

"Argh!  We have three Black Reavers, five skeletons, two wraiths after us!"

"Bah.  Let's stop and kill them."

"There's a gnome following us, too."

"OMG!  RUN!"

Argh!  A cleric's greatest frustration is melee who don't pay attention to
enrage messages.  How hard is it to stop attacking and wait for enrage to
pass?  It's so annoying to see super-hasted warriors melee themselves to
death on enrage.

Hehehe.  Always a warm fuzzy feeling to see a mob trying to run away.

Awesome weekend.  =)  Thanks for sharing.
