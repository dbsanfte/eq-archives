Heh. A couple of people were having a price war over leather padding last
night in the Bazaar, and it was down to about 15pp per padding when I set up
my Bazaar mule, Anthi, with 5 1/2 stacks at 25 per. I sent a tell to the
lower priced seller along the line of "I'm in no hurry to sell, you know"

I looked again 5 minutes later, and the padding on that trader was back up
to 20 per, and a couple of others were back up to 25. =)
