I'm not sure. Everquest can prohibit IGE's use trivially, by destroying 
the in game economy. The question is can Sony have its cake and eat it 
too? Can they have an environment where they encourage people to trade 
items and plat for other items and plat, or other consideration (e.g. 
services like coprse recoveries, rezzes, escorts to freeport...) but 
somehow prohibit that the consideration be external to the game. Ie... 
you can trade plat for virtual items, for virtual favours, but not for 
pennies. Does an IP holder generally have that kind of granularity of 
control? I don't think there are any cases where the IP holder grants 
its users to buy and sell the item, but can restrict the currency they 
use.

Further IGE, can step back, and become a broker instead of an inventory 
holder. At which point they are employed by the buyer to locate a 
seller, or vice versa, with no hand in the actual transaction other than 
they are being paid for their out of game service by via out of game 
currency. In that scenario, can SOE do -anything- at all?

Actually I can... sort of. And for the sake of the discussion I will. :)

On two separate fronts:

First, with respect to the buying and selling exclusively of platinum: 
The core busines done buy IGE is in its plat sales, if we ignore the 
items, characters, etc and just look at platinum.

Is EQ -platinum- IP? It has no visual representation, beyond a silvery 
circle used in thousands of games. It is not an idea unique to EQ, or 
Sony properties. Its simply a number attached to an account, without 
even the premise of being anything more. Might as well argue your phone 
number is your IP, or your bank balance.

I'm not convinced Platinum has any characteristic that makes it 
meaningful to interpret it as IP at all!

-------- 
Second: with respect to items, a weaker argument:

Now we, can agree the idea of the "Short Sword of Morin" is IP, its 
graphical image, its name, the story behind it, etc are all IP. But is 
the virtual representation of one IP? Suppose for example what would be 
the case if the representation wasn't virtualized:

Consider 'Monopoly Money' which is protected IP owned by Parker Bros, so 
an IGE can't legally just copy it, and sell it, or even make their own 
knockoffs and sell it as monopoly money... but what if they bought used 
boxes of monopoly, separated out the various pieces, and sold them 
individually. (as replacement parts or whatever...)

Perhaps IGE buying and selling a short sword of morin is equivalent to 
buying and selling monopoly currency, tokens, and other game pieces. Is 
it a violation of IP to do that? Could I not open up a mail order 
storefront and sell replacement game pieces for games... I think I 
could... several ebay stores are devoted to the sales of game tokens, 
presumably not in violation any IP rights.

Now, the only difference with EQ is that the items are 'virtualized'. 
Does that necessarily change how they should be treated?

A good bridge product would be magic the gathering and magic the 
gathering online, where the virtual cards, and real cards are bought, 
sold, and traded interchangeably. Its a given that Wizards (Hasbro) 
couldn't legally prevent real card owners from exchanging them at will 
(assuming they wanted to)... why should they be able to in the virtual 
world?

Note the focus is on -legal- prevention, not technical prevention. I'm 
sure we agree it would be trivial for them to implement program code to 
prevent virtual cards from moving from account to account... but if we 
assume they leave the ability to trade virtual cards intact, as they 
must for virtual game to mirror the real game. (And as EQ must in order 
to preserve the in game economy) can they -legally- prevent me from 
taking two of your virtual cards for two of my real ones? Or two of your 
virtual cards for two USD?

No, I can't. But the burden of proof isn't IGE's. Its Sony's. And I 
don't think they can argue successfully that they conclusively have been 
damaged.
