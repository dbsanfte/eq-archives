The general reply to wisdom you'll get here is that +wis items are 
better up to 200 wis, especially at your level.  As far as focus effects 
go, Mana conservation is a great one.  Their effect works every time, 
but depending on what level will only affect certain spells.  Focus 
effects will have a roman number after them, telling you what level 
spells they will affect
I    <= 20
II   <= 44
III  <= 60
IV   <= 65

Some that are handy for clerics, Mana preserv will reduce mana costs on 
all spells except complete heals by 10%, Improved Healing will raise the 
ammount healed, also sans CH, by 20%, Extend Enhancement makes buffs 
last 15% longer.

Fine Antique Ring is a nice item win MP II, nodrop, but items are easy 
to aquire where you're probably hunting.  Good luck to you.
