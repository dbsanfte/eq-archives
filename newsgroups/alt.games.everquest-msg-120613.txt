hehe there you go again.  I said I would not provide examples of how one
might exploit a guard.  I never said that I would not provide examples
of anything of any kind at any time in the future.  Neat attempt though
hehe.  I am a bit baffled why you would find it weird that I would point
this out in response to you posting and I quote "Another self-righteous
twit who thinks he's qualified to tell the rest of us what the
developer's intent is." considering it is a direct refutation of your
point and clearly demonstrates developer intent.

I was referring to the times when a wandering guard comes to your fight
and ends it in his favor.  Please do try to keep up with these complex
issues, there was no mention of running mobs to guards either
intentionally or accidentally.  You really need to work on this stuff, I
know you are just here for the summer, but some day when school is out
for good you may want to make a career as a usenet poster and you are
going to have to develop the skills, so why not try a bit harder now?

No, you seem to have misunderstood.  I was cautioning him to be careful
not to use them in such a manner as to endanger his account.  He is a
long time poster here and I'd hate to see any trouble come to him.  I
labeled anyone who wanted to quibble over chapter and verse of the
rules,  the sort of fella who would quote from the Play Nice Policy to
support his claims regarding valid tactics, you know, a scum bag rules
lawyer, just like I said.  Disagree with me all you want, just don't try
to support exploits by saying that the specifics of the rules do not
detail this exact act as a violation and so until they do the act is
valid.  If they had to document that each potential exploit was an
invalid tactic for each potential individual NPC and at each potential
coordinate triad within each zone  where such an encounter could occur I
think even a profitable enterprise such as SOE might be crushed under
the bureaucratic weight of it all.  If you look closely you will see
that rule 11 is the only rule regarding exploits in the entire list.  So
does that mean there is only one exploit possible in the game or does it
mean that that single rule applies to all exploits, so individual rules
for each exploit are not required?
