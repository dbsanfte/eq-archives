I see you felt the need to up the asshole quotient.  Well, believe
whatever you want.

My meaning should have been obvious.  Here it is for the
understanding-impaired:
(a) invoking the notwidthstanding clause would create a major hassle,
second only to Quebec calling another referendum
(b) the most it gains you is 5 years, since
(c) at the end of five years your use of the clause is over, and then
(d) if you choose to re-enact the legistlation, you create a national
debate all over again, because
(e) you can't simply extend or renew, you need to go through the whole
process again

Was that simple enough, or do you need pictures?

No, the maximum is 5 years.  If a legislation wants more time, they
have to start the process over: create a bill, debate, vote the bill
into law, etc.  Instead of calling me a liar again call up an expert
on constitutional law, as I did.

No, but if you loan it out once others are more likely to ask to
borrow your hamster.

There is a general opinion that it would- that the fewer uses of
Section 33, the better.  There is a great deal of published opinion on
the subject.  Since 33 can only be used to suspend individual rights,
the belief follows that the more its used, the easier it becomes to
use, the less secure our rights are.   You don't agree, that's fine.

You should do something about that chip on your shoulder.  I don't
care what beefs you have against Ontario or any other province, that
was NOT the point here.  In case you actually missed it, the point was
Section 15, which you insist I have wrong.   I'll let you look up the
ruling for youself.  No point me quoting it, you'll just call me a
liar.

As to the issue of provincial courts ruling on federal statutes,
that's neither new nor unusual.  I fact BC courts have done it
recently as well.   In a message posted July 24 I commented on that
fact myself.  I won't bother quoting my words- lets just say I did,
you tell me I'm lying about the meaning, etc., etc.

Democracy is (in part) defined by a "rule of the majority".  As such
I'm not a big believer in democracy.  Not everything needs to involve
or consult the majority, particularly if it doesn't affect them.

The granting of common-law status on Jan. 1, 2001 had so little impact
on soceity as a whole, I see no reason to think that going the extra
half step would create any real additional stress, financial concern,
or even debate.  Sure, people talk big during the changes, but by the
time they take effect nobody even notices.

So yes, I deny that the change could be stressful to others.  It
doesn't concern anyone except those busybodies who decide to get all
worked up about it, and those directly effected- people in same-sex
relationships.   I think most Canadians are is ignorant as you are
that we have common-law status, and would similarly forget about the
issue by the time marriage came into effect.

I you know you'll probably disagree with this, and get abusive about
it... whatever turns your crank.

Why ask me, you seem to think me completely ignorant!  Go ask people
in Quebec, at least they have experience in that sort of thing.  Only
advice I can give you is not to call a referendum unless you're damn
sure you can win.

Right now that's the federal government.  You've just argued, then,
that its ok by you if the feds legislated same-sex marriage tomorrow.
Please call and tell them that, its not too late for them to drop the
appeal and save taxpayers a lot of money.
