I'll have to say the fault is yours, you just don't know where to hunt.  At
27 you should have been doing treants in SK and making tons of cash, earlier
levels you should have been killing the sisters in OOT, now you could also
go kill gargoyles but they might be green to you.  Hell my level 10 necro
still sells bone chips for a hefty sum.
Of course you could have 10,000pp in the bank and have a lousy time playing
and get everyone you group with killed, so remember money or INT does make
the game fun.
