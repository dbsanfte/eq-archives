Found an interesting post on the developers boards. It was VI answering
a huge laundry list of questions from the Mages about their class. One
question posed was the ancient one about pet damage and how much xp they
take. It get's asked and debated a LOT in this forum, so I thought I
would repost it here, since I found it interesting.
*************************
Q) How much experience does a pet take from a group is it still 1% on
average (Various player tests have indicted that a pet takes the same
amount of experience as a player)?
ï¿½Ascii

A) A pet will take a fair share of the experience (as if it was an
additional party member) IF the pet does more damage than all other
group members (individually). If any party member outdamages the pet,
the pet only takes 1% of the experience.
**************************
I think the key thing here is the word "individually". In other words,
four of you may easily outdamage the pet "in total", but the pet is
still going to take a full share of the xp unless one of you can
outdamge it *by yourself*. Otherwise, 1%.  Good to know.
