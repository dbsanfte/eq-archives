But he wasn't really saying anything that bad. I mean, he didn't say and
racist slurs about Jews or anything like that, he didn't say that they
should be killed or anything like that.  It's true that Hollywood is
controlled by Jews, and most movies that come out of Hollywood are crap,
perhaps he was a little too extreme with the "do as I say not as  I do"
written on the ring, and the lil' Kim stuff was also a bit extreme.  But he
came off as someone who doesn't like big business ruining movies, not as
someone who is anti Semitic, it just so happens that Jews control the major
movie business., had it been....Hindus he would probably be complaining
about that.

The kind that expresses unpopular opinion?

I'm not seeing the cause and effect between those two things.
