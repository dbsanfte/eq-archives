Here is how it used to work, before the new /con color.

1. If the mob is blue, the experience is ZL^2, where Z is the zone
experience modifier, and L is the level of the mob.

2. If the mob is green, one level below blue for you, the experience
is ZL^2/2.

3. If the mob is green, two levels below blue for you, the experience
is ZL^2/4.

4. If the mob is green, three levels or more below blue for you, the
experience is zero.

I don't know anyone who currently uses ShowEQ, so can't personally
check to see how this changed with the new /con color.
