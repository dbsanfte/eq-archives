So, lately I've been giving Mudfish a break from adventuring, letting 
him cool his heels in Shar Vahl, kick back, and spend his days in happy 
idleness while I play my broodling necromancer, Hazma.  Level 10 and 
having fun with it despite being quite poor all the time... but this 
isn't a "where do I make uber plat?" post.

On of the things I determined to do when I hit Stromm was to actually 
try to complete newbie class quests.  I've gotten the first and second 
skullcap (was quite easy) and am working on the third, and it's on the 
third where I'm stuck.  I need to brew embalming fluid.  To do this, I 
need bone granite powder.  To make bone granite powder, I need granite 
pebbles.  To get granite pebbles, I need to toady up and get them from 
the Toilmaster.  And in order to get them from the Toilmaster, I have to 
bring the bastard the shackles off escaped froglok slaves.

These things spawn in the Swamp of No Hope, and here's where I'm stuck, 
because in all the time I've ever been there, with this character and 
other, long-deleted baby Iksar, I've never seen one.  I've heard that 
the trick to get them to spawn is to kill things at the first island 
(follow the path out from the entrance and cross the first bit of water 
you come to) until the escort pops up, then follow him and keep him 
alive, and eventually he'll call out the slaves (which are, I guess, in 
hiding).  Is this correct -- that is, has anyone gotten this to work? 
I'm high enough level now that the escorts don't aggro on me, making it 
much easier to follow 'em close and keep 'em alive, but yesterday I 
followed one for well over an hour, hour and a half, and though he 
stopped in several places, I didn't see him call out any slaves.

Also -- and this is a very n00b spellcaster question -- how the heck do 
I move the spell icons around in my book?
