    Dispel is an offensive spell, so can be cast on mobs to effect.

    Debuffs, DoTs, etc. are coded as buffs with negative effects. Nothing
more. So if it can strip a good buff, it can strip a bad buff too (depending
on if the buff can be removed with dispel and doesn't require cure
disease/poison/curse etc.) I can think of at least one "buff" that has a
negative component, so you can't just slot all buff effects into good and
bad. You also (sadly) have to consider PvP servers here - players being
unable to dispel a negative buff off themselves would be a radical change,
and not a good one.

    So if you have an idea how to create a system that would recognize when
a buff is actually a player cast negative buff on a mob, let Verant know. On
second thought, given how it'll be implemented, DON'T let them know. :-)
