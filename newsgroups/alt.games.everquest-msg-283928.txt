To use my 400 mana for nothing is most definitely a drain on my mana and a 
waste. I do not have a problem with my spells ever being interupted unless I 
get aggro. This was not the case. Once I hit my CH button... that mana is 
gone. Not sure what you mean by ducking, but moving and stopping the spell 
does not save the mana.  And no, two heals (in this case) was NOT better 
than none. The Druid kept whining he needed to med and took offense when 
someone told him to med up while we continued. The timer was ticking and I 
happen to be accustomed to winning Ldons and not let one bad grp member ruin 
it for us all.

As far as tank dying... that is extremely rare. He is my husband and I 
prefer a happy home. lol

And as far as 99% of druids good? I tend to agree. The majority of Druids 
(and necros for that matter... for those screaming for my head) are good 
players. But when there was an exception to the rule... I came here to post 
about it.

So shoot me.
