I agree with Kirtland. It *was* a retarded question. If he thought it
was available online all he had to do was look at the website (gee
www.everquest.com was that so hard to figure out), if he didn't think
that, he deserved to be mocked for the twit he is.

He was a typical lazy bum who wants other people to do all their work
for them.

Yes, september has arrived.

Now the man around the corner swore he'd kill the cat on sight,
so he loaded up his shotgun with nails and dynamite!
He waited and he waited for the cat to come around;
Ninety-seven pieces of the man is all they ever found....
