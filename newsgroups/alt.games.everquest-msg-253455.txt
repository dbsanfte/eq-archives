A poorly driven manual transmission is less fuel efficient than the worst automatic
transmission.  I wonder if Ford dropped the manual option, in order to meet CAFE
standards?

Likewise, a poorly-maintained V6 will consume more fuel, lubricants and parts than a
well-maintained V8.

Okay, you can call me "Admiral Apparent" now. :p

Have you considered a Ranger 4x2?  I pulled a 6k# 6'x12' tandem-axle enclosed trailer
through the Ozarks for years with my 4x2 Ranger 4.0V6 M5 shortbed.  I used a pair of
Hellwig air coil springs for the additional lift.  One clutch in 125k miles, no other
problems.  I would do it again in a heartbeat.

A 4x2 Ranger 4.0V6 7' bed has a towing capacity within 800# of the equivalent Heritage
F-150, and only 2k# less GCWR.  It sounds like your load is all in the bed, so you
probably wouldn't miss the weight-bearing capacity.  But I don't know if you need the
linear footage in the bed.

Manufacturers currently offer higher GCWR and towing weights on vehicles equipped with
automatic transmissions.  One of the designers of Ford's 4R70W and 4R100 transmissions has
told me that their primary logic is that all new automatic-equipped vehicles include at
least 2-stage transmission cooling (conduction through the case, and an in-the-radiator
cooling loop), and most new trucks use 3-stage tranny cooling (an additional air-to-air
transmission cooler, mounted in front of the radiator), so automatic trannies are supposed
to last longer, thereby reducing warranty claims.

Visit http://www.ford-trucks.com and http://www.f150online for more fun and giggles.

Now, if I include my standard signature block, am i remotely on-topic? ;->

Best regards,
