I've done the same.  Now that my Paladin is powerful enough to
do a lot more things without instantly dying, it's fun to go
back and revisit old haunts, or check out dungeons that I never
had a chance to see before.  50+ is a good time to stop and
smell the roses (or the lizards in Cazic-Thule, or whatever).
Slow down, and enjoy the scenery more now that it's not as likely
to get you killed.

Also, 50-60 is such a long road that if you try to rush it
or obsess over how long it's taking you, you'll give yourself
an ulcer by constantly asking yourself, "are we there yet?"
Just relax and enjoy the trip, you'll get there when
you get there.
