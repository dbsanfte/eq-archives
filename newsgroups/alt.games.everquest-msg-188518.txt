 The haste on a Mith2h is effected by level. Below 20th and I have no idea
if it will even be noticeable. Need to be 30th to get full effect (31%) from
it

Remember you have damage caps, 1 - 9 it's 20 and 10 - 19 it's 29 (you can
excede these with high strength but not by much) so, unless you are doing
some Meemers styl-ee power levelling, decent weapons will be wasted on low
levels, remember, a Wurmy is NOT a good twink item.
Go for the lowest delay you can and don't worry too much about the damage
just yet.

Look for cheap with low delay, imo:-
BlackJack for 1hb
luggald dagger for piercing (inc 2h)
BTC for 1hs
Nathsar Grt Swrd for 2hs
Erm...no suggestions for a fast 2hb, sorry.
