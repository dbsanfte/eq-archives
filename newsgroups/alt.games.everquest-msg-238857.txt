Hmmm...my regular group may have to try a Ruj hard.  My regular crew of
about 8 separate people has 5 wins on hard (I've been on four of them), all
in Miraguls.  We have about 7 losses, mostly in Tak.  We can pretty
consistently kill in the low to mid-40's on hard and collects in Miraguls
have given us the win in those numbers of kills while Tak has not.  We have
two limitations - our gear and AA's for the most part are average and we
rely on a monk to FD pull.  If we had a bard pulling, we probably could
probably notch that up a bit by having quicker pulls, but mana to heal
(tanks are under 7K hp's) and do damage is always going to be a bit of
limiting factor for us.  When the monk does get on a nice run of pulling
quickly, our mana bars can drop in a hurry.
