With spell sets, and the spell menus, I only /book when I want add a new
spell to my book, or, occasionlly when I want to check the info on a spell
that isn't memorized, although usually even in that case, I'll just memorize
it via the menus and check it, and then restore my spells to whatever set I
was using.

I wonder if /book is now a class thing?  Except for ports, nukes, and
self-buffs, Wizards only have a few spells in most categories that we get
spells in, so the menus are quite good enough for selecting those spells.
For ports, the menus are also fine...they are organized by major area
(continent, planes, Luclin), and within each of those, they are named
reasonably (except for the two Kunark evacs), so there is no need for extra
organization such as the spell book to find the right spell.  For the
self-buffs, they are easy to deal with on the menus, since we generally want
to simply use the highest level one we have.  Finally, nukes on the menus
are organized by type (fire/cold/magic/stun) and within each type, they are
nicely color coded, so that I've never had trouble picking the one I wanted.

However, I could see how a class with lots and lots of spells of many
different kinds, like Shaman...many of which are named in ways that don't
make them obvious, might need more grouping than the menus provide, and so
might still use the book.  Is that the case with you?

What classes would still find the book useful, and what classes are like
Wizard, where the menus are fine?
