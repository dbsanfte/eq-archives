HoT is in the east wing.  NToV is KOS to *everyone*, regardless of faction.
There's a mob parked in front of the entrance to NToV who warns you that
even if you're ally to the dragons, entering the north wing will be reason
enough to get attacked on sight.

> don't uberinos carry gate potions?

Yes, but they are expensive (1000pp!) or, in the case of the Thurg potion,
require time and effort to re-create.  Thus "uberinos" like to save them for
special occasions.  PoM is just too difficult to get to and too annoying to
farm to justify always having to run there and waste a gate potion to get
out.

All the ones I've tried work... I got a Black Flower of Functionality doing
the quests.  No reason to believe at this time that I won't be able to get
my Crazy Cleric Breastplate if I try hard enough.

Thanks.  =)
