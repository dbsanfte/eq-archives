I have a Radeon 9600 Pro. Last time I tried it on EQ, it ran EQ flawlessly.
It runs FFXI flawlessly as well, and has run all the betas I've been in
(coh, lineage 2 most recently) flawlessly. Ran SWG flawlessly. Lots of eye
candy.

Your primary options for most compatibility are the ATI card or nVidia card.
Pick which one is the fastest in each line, and get whichever one floats
your boat; Note that for the top nVidia card, it will take up 2 slots and
require a monster power supply... the card by itself pulls something like
200 watts from your power supply. Personally I'd get whatever is the king of
the ATI heap atm.

Sound I'd pick up a top of the line Audigy myself. But that's just me.

If you want to really help things out, see if you can squeeze in another
half gig or gig of ram. Also I'd get 2 S-ATA drives into a striped raid
array configuration, assuming sky-the-limit.

Oh yeah, I'd be doing a double (or quad) processor box, rather than a 64
bit. nothing will really support 64 bit for at least a year or more, I'm
sure EQ doesn't/EQ2 won't care. EQ2 will support multi threading, I assume.
(Galaxies does, and I would assume they would not skimp on EQ2) I think they
talked about adding multi threading to EQ a couple of years ago, don't know
if they did.

Actually assuming sky-the-limit, there's a nice raid5 SCSI array we put on a
customer's server we built at work... installing 2003 small business server
took 4.5 minutes on it. (normally 30 min or so).
