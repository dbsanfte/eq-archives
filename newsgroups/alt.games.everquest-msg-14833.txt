You have been struck by the "low level effect".  The newbies and
semi-newbies of the game don't realize that people sometimes go kiting
things around like that.  So they think... "hey... when I get in
trouble, I run around in circles hoping someone will stop by... I
should probably help that guy out so he doesn't die!"  So they get all
excited that they get to help someone and ignore everything in chat.
They just go at the mob full force to try and save the poor soul
running away from it.  When you get to high lvl's, you wont run into
this... mainly because the newbs or people who dont know what they are
doing, wont attack your mob cause it is red to them.  And people your
current level will be smart enough by that lvl to not mess with you
unless you ask for it.

When I make a new character, one of the most irritating things is
having to deal with all the low level players.  The exceptions are
twinks from high lvl players that are great to be around, and then you
have your rare, "smart newbie" who is a new guy who is actually smart
enough to figure some things out on his own. (note that I had to
explain the phrase, "smart newbie" for all the "non-smart newbies")
If you read that and thought... I could have figured that out on my
own, then maybe you too are a smart newbie :)
