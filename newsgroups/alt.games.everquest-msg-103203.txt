Stein of Moggok is still good, or crude stein.  I usually have crude stein 
and rod of insidious glamour equipped, still, at level 54.  For a good 
cheap robe, blackened crystalline is quite nice.  Gatorscale sleeves, 
drake hide leggings.  Gold Sapphire earrings.  Rings with int on them... 
silver star rose quartz ones are practically free and +2 int.  platinum or 
velium sapphire necklace is pretty expensive... blackened alloy medallion 
might be a good substitute.  Impskin gloves, or incandescent.  
Incandescent Mask.  Shoot, just do all the soluskek temple quests. :)  
Savant's cap is cheap as dirt, maybe 30pp, for a bit more you can get 
runed circlet or nightshade wreath.

This is all thrown off by the fact the economy on my server is hosed... 
some of this stuff may cost quite a bit more outside of ayonae ro.  

Or maybe all the economies are hosed now, I dunno, I'm a provincial little 
gnome. :)
