Hello, Gomer Pyle.  Welcome to the Real World of the Internet.  Internet
has lag for a couple of reasons, one...  Lots of data, small pipeline...
When a modem is trying to corrolate 100k/s of data for a pipeline that was
suited to handle for 5k/s data...  Yeah, I would say lag is going to be
there.  When you happen to be sitting about 15 internet hops from your
location to Everquest servers...  Hmmm... That is about 10 places where
some idiot could go 'OOPS' and kill your connection.

Another thing a Guide or GM will tell you about LD death...  How can they
verify you died due to going LD.  Given there are some odd number of hops
between you and them, which outages happen sporadically and not often...
Taking your word for it is like taking a suspect's word that he didn't do
it when he has no proof other than his own word.  I can say that you are a
pedophiliac psycho murderer, and if Lokari is a friend of mine, have Lokari
back up my claim.  Hence, they can't take witnesses as proof either.  So,
how do they know that you didn't pull the plug because it went bad, I heard
some rogues were pretty much doing that in Uguk a few times on one server.

SW:G is made by Verant, and will probably involve the same idea.  And if
you bothered to look at some of previews of it, it will be more intensive
data wise than what EQ was, and probably what EQ is right now WITH the
Luclin models.

This means that maybe SW might not be for you as well.
