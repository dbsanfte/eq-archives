You can do the reincarnation quest but its only open to followers of 
certain religions. There are some quests to switch your religion but they 
can be tough to find if you didn't pick an eastern starting city.

Also if you do this, you won't be able to go on any Plane of Karma raids 
and take down Ganesh and Shiva...

I hear Kali can drop some cool stuff - a nice sword, some dead-body 
earrings, necklace of skulls, and a girdle of dead men's hands, but she is 
kinda tough (she flurries).
