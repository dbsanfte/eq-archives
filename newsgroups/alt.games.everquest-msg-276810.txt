They're out to get ya!  I'm tellin ya, it's a conspiracy!

Read the whole thing, or Kahvok's posts anyway, and, just for
giggles, focus on comprehension rather than paranoia.  They
were working with convoluted legacy code that implemented
complex and poorly designed mechanics.  They couldn't (can't)
redo the combat system without retuning vast numbers of
encounters.  The mere fact that they were reduced to parsing
simulated encounters in order to understand how the melee
system worked in practice tells us just how unwieldy a beast
they were (are) managing, and this was pre-PoP.

It's pretty amusing really.  I always figured that was the
way things were, but this is the first time (to my knowledge)
that it's been publicly admitted.  The sad part is that they
really had no choice, the return on investment for rewriting
the game code and rebuilding the encounters would've been
very negative, as would the player community's reaction to
the inevitable problems after the 3+ days of downtime for
the rollout.
