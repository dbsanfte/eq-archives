Someone else in another thread claimed(if I understood them correctly) that
horses generate standing HP regen at all times, if this is so then with a horse
HP regen would actually be worse than normal for a shaman, instead of better.

Thus far (level 25) I've been sitting down so little that my meditation skill
hasn't hit 50 yet.  I'm sure a sea change is coming, and I can certainly endorse
the horse from having had one as a cleric... but this HP issue needs to be
addressed.

Of course the other issue is that I'd like to spend more time indoors as a
shaman; if thats the case then a horse isn't going to do much good at all,
besides giving me something to put in my ammo slot
