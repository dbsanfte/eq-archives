Well my character name is Seettwin and I am on the Druzzil server. I have
been to the site eqatlas and castersrealm and have gotten some stuff off of
there. I will go back and get the maps to the connecting areas and then get
all the class info on druid hafling. I do have to say even though the map
was good I still got lost. I also have to say that I am one to jump into
things and learn it by trial and error. I'm not all that big on mauals cause
they tend to be not all that well written. I prefer websites that have
guides on there cause they are written by players.
Thanks for the response and I will see what I can figure out from the info
you gave me.
Seth
aka Seettwin on EQ Druzzil
