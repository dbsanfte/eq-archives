Here are a few things you're missing that might help to
answer most of your questions:

1.  While cheap armor is roughly 1pp per AC, cheap armor will
only get you so many AC, total.  If you want to get much more
than that "base" amount of cheap AC, it becomes progressively
more difficult (and therefore more expensive).  Yeah, you can
get a "cheap" breastplate that gives you 10AC (for example), but
when you start hunting dragons or whatever and need a lot more
than just that 10AC, you have to start looking for an
uber-breastplate that gives 30+AC, and those are rare enough,
and hard-as-hell-enough, to acquire that you're going to have
to pay a very pretty penny for each AC it contains (like
1,000p per AC point...)

2.  Similarly, *where* an item is equipped can make a huge
difference.  Why 3,000p for a 5AC range-slot item?  Because
there are VERY few range slot items that provide *any* AC
at all.  So after you've filled every other equipment slot
with the best AC items that you can manage to acquire,
to the point where an additional 5AC on any other item
(e.g. breastplate, helmet, ring, etc.) would either move
that item into far, far more expensive territory, *or*
be absolutely impossible (e.g., if you already have
an AC 6 Ivandyr's Hoop earring, you won't be able to
boost your earring AC by another 5, because there simply
*aren't* any AC 11 earrings).  So sooner or later, the
only way to squeeze another AC5 onto your body is
to bite the bullet and pay 3,000 for an AC5 range slot
item.

3.  Furthermore, the *combination* of stats on an item
can make a critical difference.  At higher levels,
you're desperate not only to maximize your AC, but to
maximize several other stats and resists at the same time.
So a single item that can add to BOTH your AC *and*
some other highly prized stat(s) can be *very* valuable,
because it can allow you to not have to compromise
on your stat balance (e.g., without that item, you'd
have to choose between an item that gave *only* AC,
or *only* a stat).

4.  As with most economies, rarity can make a big
difference in value.  A seemingly not-so-hot item
can be worth a very lot of money if it's a) very hard
to acquire, and b) anything better is even more rare.

So putting it all together, you'll find that as you
raise levels and get better and better equipment
(and *need* better and better equipment to survive
the harder encounters), you'll reach a point where
all the "cheap and easy" AC/stat items you can find
have already been added to your character, and the
only way to climb any higher is to shell out another
200pp for a single extra AC.  And then to climb one
AC beyond *that*, it'll cost you 220pp.  And up, and
up, and up, as you climb higher and higher on the
high-end scale.

It's like finding ways to make your car accelerate
faster -- in most cases it costs only a few hundred
bucks to turn a "0-60 in 10 seconds" car into a
car that can do it in 8 seconds.  That's two full
seconds of reduction for a few hundred bucks.  But
the more you push the limits, the more expensive
improvements get, to the point where shaving
a couple of hundreds of a second off of the elapsed
time of a profession funny-car can costs tens of
thousands of dollars.

That's because, in your example, anyone working on their strength
already has the plentiful-and-cheap STR+5 earrings, but if they
want *15* STR (two earrings plus +5 STR from something else), they
then have no choice but to dump a lot of money into a rare STR+5
weapon.


>        slots are that important?

Yes, once they've already filled all other slots with the "easy"
equipment and all that's left to boost things any higher is,
say, that uncommon set of boots that has a measly WIS+2,
when boots that have *any* WIS on them at all are far and
few between.


> what are their ranks? what slots should i
>use for what stats? what's the efficient way to do this?

Th easiest rule of thumb is to use the economy (e.g., item
prices) as your cue.  If cheesy boots with only WIS+2 go
for 250pp (and they do), then that's your clue that WIS
on the "foot" slot is hard to find.

Basically, the proper balance works itself out -- whenever
you find an item for slot "X" that's better than what you
already have, and is something you can afford, get it
(keeping in mind that "better" depends on your personal
preferences as to which stats you prefer to maximize).

Then when things start getting harder to improve, you'll
find yourself considering possible upgrades against each
other based on "performance versus price", and you'll
make your purchases accordingly.

So it's not so much a "price formula" for any given AC/stat
combination, it's more "ok, I know what I have *now*, and
what I'd most like to improve, so let me consider the
upgrade options that are open to me, and figure which
looks most attractive given the money I have to spend
(keeping in mind that gaining AC in the shoulder slot may
entail *losing* WIS, since I'll have to abandon
my current +WIS shoulder item, etc.)

A good place to figure "shopping lists" and compare
one upgrade option against another is www.eqprices.com.
Using the menu on the left-hand-side, you can do
targeted searches for items that you race/class can
wear, and which boost a given stat (or AC) for a given
equipment slot.
