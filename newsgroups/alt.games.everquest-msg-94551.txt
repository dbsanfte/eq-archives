I tried several places with my (then) 40 bard, and he seemed to be the
softest hitting. Pets are better, but you need to find someone to train you,
and its just as easy to get someone to heal/regen you on ortallius. Just
dont kill him because off the bad faction hit. Aside from that, theres
nothing special about him. It took me about 4 hours to get from 190 to 200.
Fight at the zoneline and people tend to dump regen on you.
