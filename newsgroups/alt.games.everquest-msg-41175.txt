I spent 3 months in DC in and around various government facilities and
without exception all the people there were friendly, helpful and courteous
(even when scanning you down to your fillings!). Seeing the Pentagon in
flames was especially shocking to me.

I can only echo the (belated) sentiments of my countryman here and say to
all the US folk on this newsgroup that the thoughts and prayers of all of us
here in the UK are with you. Nobody should have to live in the fear of
something like this happening.

P.S. I'd love to somehow help by donating blood but I believe (distance
aside) it wouldn't be accepted because of the Mad Cow disease risk. But if
you can please do so. If it was a member of your family that needed it, you
wouldn't think twice.
