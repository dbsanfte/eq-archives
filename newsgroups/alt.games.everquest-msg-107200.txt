What level are you?  If under 10 or so, I'd say start your cat all over.
What I've done is find someone you trust ALOT, give him or her everything
you own, including money and the stuff in the bank, delete your character
and start him over with the same name.  Pick up your stuff from your friend
and you are all ready.

There is NO WAY to get your cloak back without starting over.  I've tried.

It sucks that they don't tell you this before you turn in the cloak to the
wrong guy.

What I'd do is get a printout of the walkthru on Allakhazam before you go to
turn stuff in.  After having stuff poof on me, I've gotten alot more careful
of quest turnins.  I always at least look it up before I turn it in.  Makes
it frustrating sometimes, I gotta log to look it up but it keeps me from
turning in the wrong thing at the wrong time.

Good Luck
