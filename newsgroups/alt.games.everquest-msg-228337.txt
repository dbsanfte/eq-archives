No, at ALL levels.  Its just that, like warriors (at all levels), the 
DPS they do is pretty lame compared to real DPS classes except in those 
few limited cases.

and pet, which again is only useful from 54 to 60, by which point the 
pet is starting to be unable land blows

Also at very low levels, where -any- class can do melee damage fairly 
readily, and clerics get to stack nukes on top of damage.  And in the 
mid , where cleric melee isn't all that much worse than warrior melee, 
given comperable weapons, and again, clerics who aren't called on to 
heal can nuke.

Cleric nuking is often discounted, but its damage to mana ratio is 
really quite decent, the problem is that the cast time and recast times 
are long.  This means that in killing One mob, they make lousy nukers, 
unable to dump their whole mana bar before the mob dies.  In an exp 
group situation, though, where everyone is often limited by mana regen, 
"burst" DPS doesn't matter, just efficiency, and there nuking clerics 
may well surprise you.  Get them a horse so

In full group the penalty doesn't amount to much, its only really an 
issue when your damage output is significantly lower than that of the 
pet; not each, but all together.  And as you say, kill rate offsets 
that, the more that charmed pet outdamages the group, the more he's 
dramatically raising your kill rate.  Plus, for loot or faction or LDoN 
success, faster kill rate isn't offset by anything at all; the penalty, 
such as it is, applies only to exp.

Mage and druid are already in the "outdamage a warrior" category, 
although ones who can and will charm clearly do by an even larger margin.

Aye, thus the "may well" part; depending on the AA and such a warrior 
might well outdamage the paladin even on undead.

If rangers don't outdamage warriors significantly, this is sad news for 
ranger, who are normally given "DPS" slots in groups.  Just as warriors 
have lost their "Sponge" slot to paladins and SK's, if rangers aren't in 
the same general level as rogues, mages, wizards, et al, you really have 
to wonder why people would bring them along.

Either of the two paladins, both of which are better suited to the job 
anyway!

I've been out of the high end game for a while now (and never really was 
in the really high end, just 65 cleric in a guild that hadn't quite gone 
Vex Thal), so perhaps itemization has changed the relative levels of 
warrior versus other melee damage output.  Back in the pre LOY days, 
though, warriors seemed to do a lot less damage than even non EQ/AM rangers.

Sigh, I feel sooo out of the loop.

Its my -guess- that the "non DPS" classes do a lot more damage now 
compared to what they once did, but that this should be balanced by DPS 
classes likewise doing a lot more damage than they once did.  But if 
only some classes got boosted up by recent changes (and gradual 
mudflation) then its entirely possible that a warrior who isn't standing 
in front of a mob -is- a DPS class after all.

You wouldnt' know it by my earlier experience, nor by what "everyone" 
seems to be saying even now.
