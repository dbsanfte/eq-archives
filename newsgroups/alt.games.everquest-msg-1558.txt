It doesn't have to be twinking, but yes it will help.  At lower levels,
a GLS is the only thing that will really help you much, anyway.  (When
you get to the teens, get a Shiny Brass Shield, which has a GLS built
into it).  Once you get to level 8 or 10 and have a wimpy magical
weapon, go out and hunt wisps till you get one.  You can suffer with
night blindness for awhile.  We've all been there.  Hated it, but been
there.  Wisps are great for xp and cash anyway.  It's just a nice bonus
that they drop items that can be used as light sources.
