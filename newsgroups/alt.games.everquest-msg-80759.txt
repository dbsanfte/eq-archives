I find the best time is after you've gotten done dropping 2 Divines and
a Celestial on the enchanter.  By then he should be done parking all the
adds and your tank should be down to a bubble or so.  If you start now
and nothing else gets onto the enchanter you are set!

Oh, how do YOU use it??.... sorry, that was more how I use it.  Lets
see, when you first get it you'll want to start casting early, 2 bubbles
of hp left on a sturdy tank, a bit sooner if its a wood elf warrior
<g>.  Using your best hp buffs including symbol on your tank is a good
idea, the more hp he has the more benefit you get from your CH.  Once
you start to get a feel for when to start casting, the nervousness you
feel now will change to curiosity as to how late you can start and still
catch the warrior.  This is not a bad thing, since past 50 you will 
tend to find yourself in increasingly higher pressure fights.  Learn to
laugh at death now so you can remain calm later when things get tough.

Congratulations on that level Handy, this is where you start reaping the
rewards of all the long hard levels it took to get here <G>.
