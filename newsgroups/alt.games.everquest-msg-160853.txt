The healing song doesn't stack with other healing songs, unfortunately.
In fact, unlike necro DoTs, bard DoTs don't stack because they contain a debuffing
component in addition to the damage component.

So about the only bard song that stack with the same song from another bard
are the "pulse of mana"  type songs: "chant of
clarity" and "chorus of clarity".  There may be other songs higher than 47 which are pulse
type too, but my bard is only 47 and hasn't looked deeply into the higher level songs.

Oh, there's also boastful bellow, which is a one-shot DD song.  That would "stack" too.
(And also Denon's Desparate Dirge, but that song is next to useless).

I'm using the term "stack" very loosely here, because the effects don't persist, but you can have
multiple bards singing them for greater effect.

If that's not confusing enough, I can work on it :P
