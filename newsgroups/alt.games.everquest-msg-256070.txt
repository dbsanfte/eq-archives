Yep, easy trap.

WR bags? Bah... :) There's a bag you can get at level one collecting 
garbage near shar vahl with a very small WR, but it holds giant items 
iirc. So its not complete garbage. There is also a 10% wr bag you can 
get out of warrens very easily at low levels.

When you hit your late 30s/early 40s you'll be able to get an EE bag and 
a Rallic pack, and that should suffice.

Before that, either just deal with extra trips to the bank, or get the 
mage/shm summoned bags. (Or just create a mag/shm and get them to the 
tender age where they can summon them for you). =)

Yeah, that's the hardest part. I have a couple friends I group with 
regularly so that at least hasn't been an issue. (Although they were 
starting to groan at getting my cleric celestial healing... finally got 
it after 5 days killing wurms while 42nd level though... talk about a 
rush when it finally dropped. Picking it up in the bazaar would just 
never be that satisfying.

Not sure if I agree with the logic. Without friends who'll support you, 
you might find it discouraging trying to be MT in twink groups as a 
nontwinked gear reliant warrior.

Hahaha. Lol. Yeah. White cons are rarely soloable in non-twink gear at 
low levels, unless you're playing a trick class like enc or nec with 
charm or fear tools. Tackle a decaying skelly with a rusty weapon 
(ideally a longsword i think) and sharpen it to tarnished. Best weapon 
you can earn at level 1 and much better than the training sword.

Yup. Teaches you to take those 'any halfwit can get to level 20 in a 
day' posts with a grain of salt. People forget what its like to play in 
cloth and patchwork with a rusty weapon.. er tarnished weapon ;)

Good luck & Enjoy!
