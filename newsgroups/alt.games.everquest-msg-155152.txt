Thought I'd post this again, and get some opinions.  My cleric has reached
40 and I'm looking for new hunting grounds.  I was in CC from 37-39 but got
lucky there and got the Geonoids camp for about 10 hours and doubt I'd get
it again (at least not within my patience threshold) and I went to DL and
had an awesome group there (chain pulling and good communication, nice
stress, was fun) but now I'm looking for somewhere new to go.  Criteria are,
pickup groups available as I don't have a regular hunting party and my guild
is either levels above or below me, decent xp and decent loot, but mainly
something fun, good stress.  I like to freak out as my cleric rather than
running full mana the entire time and occasionally standing up to heal.  I
like and want to be stretched.  Anyway, any advice would be appreciated.
