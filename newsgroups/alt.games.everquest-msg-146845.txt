First, it is an absolute requirement that you get Shadows of Luclin to
activate AA.  No SoL, no AA, and you'll be... well, I'll let you figure out
how to end that sentence.

If you have SoL, then hitting the "V" key will bring up the AA box.  You'll
see a place where you can determine how much of your XP goes to regular XP
and how much goes to AA XP.

Some people have guesstimated that AA XP is roughly equivalent to XP in 52.

As you earn AAXP, you eventually "ding" and gain an AA point to spend.  What
the table is saying is that in order to get to Level 1, you need to
accumulate and spend two AA points.

As an example, I earned two AA points and got Spell Casting Mastery, Level
1.  Then I earned four more points and spent them on Spell Casting Mastery,
Level 2 (commonly shortened to SCM2).  I need six more AA points to get
SCM3; so far I've accumulated three.

All together, I need 12 AA points to get SCM3.

No.  It costs six AA points to acquire that skill, but acquiring that skill
only gives you one more mana regen point per tick.  So getting Mental
Clarity: Level 1, MC2, and MC3 will get you three more mana per tick and
cost you twelve AA points.  That's nothing to sneeze at, of course.
Speaking for myself, I find other AA abilities more useful, so will be
getting those before I get Mental Clarity.  But I will eventually come back
and get that skill.

I'd find the shaman boards and ask around there for advice.  First of all,
you need to spend six AA points in the General category before you can even
think of things like Mental Clarity.  Second, you need to be level 55 before
you can acquire skills like Mental Clarity.  For myself, when SoL came out I
was 52, and I stopped leveling long enough to get Innate Run 3 (us poor
clerics don't get SoW), then I put all my XP into regular XP until I hit 60.
My advice is that you do the same - your new guild will want you to be level
60 much more than they'll want you to have Mental Clarity and the like.  AA
abilities are very very nice, but getting to 60 is *much* more important.
You *might* consider stopping long enough to get Regen 3, as I can see that
being a very useful skill for a shammy, but after that, focus on getting 60.

The above is my opinion only, of course.
