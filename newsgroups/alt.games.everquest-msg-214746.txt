This exactly what I'm complaining about.  Mid level characters are
almost all alts of high-level players who PL in Unrest, Paudal
Caverns, High Keep, etc..  All of my characters have followed exactly
that path because there's nothing else to do.  Being a long time
RPG'er, I really would like to experience exploring a dungeon and
doing a quest that involves more than going to the bazaar and buying
items to turn into an NPC.  I would like to have some cool NO DROP
gear that you can only get from killing some bad ass mob deep in a
dungeon, but I guess those days are long past.

I really hope SOE adds some kind of ZEM to LDoN to encourage
high-level players to have their alts leave Paudal Caverns so us noobs
can do something more interesting than sit and kill recondite bandits
all day.
