I was semi-afk in Felwithe outside by the fisherpeople over by S Felwithe
zone (by the 2 buildings) when some wanderer attacked me.  Being level 60 my
enchanter took a bit of abuse (probably 600 damage?) but didn't really have
trouble zoning out.  I haven't wandered Kelethin yet but in either case I'd
simply recommend that you don't go AFK in either city.
