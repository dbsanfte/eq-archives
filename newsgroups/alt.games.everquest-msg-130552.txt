I am trying to use EQLog to parse my log files and it keeps aborting
due to timeline discrepancies in my log files. Does anyone know what
causes the log file to show a block of activity out of choronological
order?

Example:
[Thu Jul 11 21:14:54 2002] You gain party experience!!
[Thu Jul 11 21:14:54 2002] orc centurion's corpse says 'You shall have
all the Crushbone orc legions on your tail for my death!'
[Thu Jul 11 21:14:55 2002] You feel your pulse quicken.
[Thu Jul 11 21:14:56 2002] [player name removed] song ends.
[Thu Jul 11 21:15:01 2002] You receive 1 silver and 2 copper as your
split.
[Thu Jul 11 21:15:02 2002] --[player name removed]has looted a Rusty
Long Sword.--
[Thu Jul 11 21:15:06 2002] You receive 1 silver as your split.
[Thu Jul 11 21:13:01 2002] Your battle fury fades.
[Thu Jul 11 21:13:06 2002] [player name removed] shouts, 'Gratz I
healed one of ya, don't leave me out) )'
.
.
.
...and so on. As you can see, it just jumps backward in time at some
points in the log file. At 21:15:06 it skipped back to 21:13:01 and
continued on from there until the next fallback later in the file.

Any ideas?
