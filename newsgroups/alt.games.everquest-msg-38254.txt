Give the Setting of EQ I am surprised I haven't seen Princess Bride on more
lists.

I am glad that Lion King isn't on that list, damn disney theives.  I can't
believe people credit that as Disney's only "Original" story in years.  

Animated wise I would have to add:
 Nightmare before Christmas
James and the Giant Peach
Ghost in the shell
Baoh (subtitled not english dubbed)
