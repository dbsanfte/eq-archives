For my 34 ranger what would be a better combination: a skyfire (primary) and
a centi short OR centi longsword (primary) and centi short. Also at what
level does the sword of skyfire proc. And if you high level uber rangers out
there could tell me what the "perfect" combination (of any weapons) for you
is, I would greatly appreciate it.

Thanks
