Even 2hs doesn't seem to help my 50th lvl ranger all that much. Doing
LDoN with a warrior, even when I didn't have to snare (higher lvl
druid was snaring) I couldn't shake agro with a Shadowflame and FBSS
haste. My solution is just to fill up on HP/AC gear and group with a
cleric who doesn't mind healing me <g>, Rangers still tank pretty well
at that lvl, I've over 1000ac and 3k hitpoints with cleric/shaman
buffs.  ... really looking forward to lvl 51 and jolt though!

Rgds, Frank
