Don't remember the band's name but it had a picture of this overweight
looking guy with a hairy back sitting in the corner with a dunce cap on his
head, yeah that looked like me, maybe it is me. maybe it is a picture of a
lot of guys in the world, but i'll just assume it is a picture of me, an 11
year old child sitting in a 28 year old body with nothing to show for it, a
boy who was given 5 talents at the start and buried them all in the earth
and ran and hid and who will lose everything at the end because they didn't
do anything with what they were given. The guy who cleans the bathrooms at
burger king will end up with 2 talents while the overweight guy in the
corner will get nothing except probably a bed and 3 meals a day in a minimum
security prison.
