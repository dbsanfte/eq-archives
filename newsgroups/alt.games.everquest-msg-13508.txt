Some people take offense.  My level 45 cleric always asks when someone
inspects without permission ... "Are you looking for something?"  If I don't
get a satisfactory answer I put them on a list of people who do not get
buffs, heals or rezes from me.  I say nothing more to them.  About a dozen
people on the list have asked me for rezes and I declined the opportunity to
help someone who was rude to me in the past.  I would never use the command
to turn off the message.  I very much want to know who the rude people are.
