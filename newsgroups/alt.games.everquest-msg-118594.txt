Sorry to go back to this so late, but I just noticed it and couldn't leave

My understanding is that what currently happens is that the exp structure is
similar in structure to D&D exp. Let's say level one is from 0 to 100 exp
and level two is 101 to 500. If you kill enough mobs to bring your
experience to 102, you level up. But if you then lose 10 experience from a
death you're now at 92, which is less than 101 so you de-level. This new
proposition is that instead of LOSING 10 experience points, you instead have
the upper limit of the level raised from 500 to 510.

Correct, dieing will still have penalty with it, I have know idea where he
went from "deficit" to "no penalty".

Actually, the deficits will most likely be more data intensive. Currently,
the game engine is checing if you level a level change every time you
gain/lose experience. The easiest way to do this is with a selection
structure that looks at experience and an standard table and determines the
player's level. If the player's level is greater than his/her level before
the exp change, then display the level-up message. If the player's level is
less than his/her previous level, then display the level-down message.

With deficits, however, the table isn't standard: a separate table would be
stored with every character because every character would now have a
different requisite number of experience points to obtain before leveling.

As for the abilities you say would have to be changes, it's all a matter of
checking that the player's level is in the correct range. If my shaman loses
level 24 and then tries to memorize Regeneration, the code compares her
level to the spell's required level and comes up with 23<24 (computers are
good with numbers). Therefore, Glaena is now no longer allowed to memorize
Regeneration.

As far as the PvP skill exploits go: whenever there's a level change you
check the current skill level to the maximum that you'll allow it to go to.
Your statement that the level deficits wouldn't be difficult to code is
true, it's just that the current system isn't that difficult either. Just
remember that you don't need a flag for all level-dependent abilities, you
just need to make a currentl-to-required level comparison at the time the
player takes an action that would allow them to use an ability they cannot
yet use.
