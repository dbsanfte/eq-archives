My necro and druid are in their 30s, and my bard in his 40s, both can solo
reds and they are untwinked.  Hopefully this will continue for a bit.

As for my wizard (53), I can't remember the last time he took on a red.  I
think I might have soloed a yellow in my 20s.  LOL.  DBs are challenging.
Of course, why solo when I can quad.  :)
