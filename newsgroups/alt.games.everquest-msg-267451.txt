I dislike them, but more because they detract from any actual strategy of the
fight, by introducing external factors.  I don't like that the actions
required by the heroic opportunity bear no relation to the actual fight.  (Not
sure I would like it more if they did, or if the whole system is a crap idea
which should be trashed).   If a shaman heroic oportunity was a slow followed
by a heal in a tough fight, it would make a lot more sense than always being
"Opening move, Smite, Smite".

Actually I don't think they will be an integral part of grouping.   Its
soloing where an extra 30 damage pulled out of nowhere (about 2 -3 times my
average hit) every 10 seconds is huge.   In a group context, you'll be seeing
twice that damage every time the wizard nukes.   And your healer will
hopefully be too busy healing to be worrying about matching up 2 smites in a
row.

I guess its possible the HO's could get overpowered enough that combat
devolves into chaining special moves, no matter how non sensical they may be..
but I don't see it happening yet, unless they scale up a lot more.
