Had a situation like this ages ago.  In an orc2 camp in EC.  Was busy
and a guy nearby spammed with /yell and I misssed it ... either wasn't
looking at my screen or was going to the wrong window no idea why
partiularly.

When he comes backs he frothing and screaming "why didn't you help". 
Now we're talking EC here ... can't be more than what level 12?
miniscule xp losss.  I explained to him that I simply hadn't seen the
yells but it didn't quieten him as he didn't believe me.

Eventually I pointed out to him that regardless of whether I had/had
not seen his yells I was not OBLIGED to respond to them anyway.

Didn't help at all ... probably made it worse as he started yelling
"so you DID see my yells!!" ... Think he's the first person to make it
onto my /ignore list!
