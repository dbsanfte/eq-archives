My name is Bebinn and yes, I'm an alt-oholic.  In 4 years of playing EQ, 
I still have the very first character I ever made (woodelf ranger on 
bristlebane named Bebinn, of course) plus innumerable alts I made just 
to try out different classes.  I have filled up at least 3 servers and 
test with characters. My son has a server filled with characters from 
when we weren't so addicted and still shared with him, LOL. Then when 
EQOA came out I started filling those servers up too.  When FFXI came 
out I considered switching to that game until I found out they charge 
extra based on how many alts you have.  I'd be paying over $100 a month 
if EQ did that.  Even though I no longer play a toon, I keep them 
around, never know when I'll get the bug to go back to one.  Name a 
server and I probably have at least one character on it, half the time 
it's a Bebinn.  There's at least 8 toons named Bebinn on the EQ servers, 
2 on the EQOA ones, and now one on EQ2's Faydark server.

Regarding the "fork out more cash":  I'm already signed up for the 
Station Access so we can play all 3 games, yet another benefit to having 
it, that's a nice thing.  Now, I gotta get back in EQ2 and figure out 
why Bebinn didn't zone to Qeynos Harbor a few minutes ago.
