I disagree. I wear eight pieces of quest eq, and even 15 levels after
I got them they are, with a couple exceptions, the best obtainable
equipment for my class and level. Many players complain that at the
level equipment drops, they always have better equipment bought from
other players. This is not true of quest armour.

Exp quests for low level characters are very worthwhile. Bone chips,
belts and shoulderpads in Kaladim all give excellent experience for
their relative risk. The Polar Bear skin quest in Halas allows a
newbie to be fully equipped in tattered armour within a few levels.
Ditto for the Curescale in Cablis.

Faction quests can be long and tedious, but I still say they are a
hell of a lot better than the alternatives, either making races
inflexible so a Dark Elf is always KOS in a human city, or making it
so transparent that faction is meaningless.

Ask players you know how many want to get their epic weapons. The
answer is hardly indicative of a quest not worth doing.

You know anyone using a Paw of Opolla or a Stein of Moggok? How about
a Wurmslayer? Maybe you know someone in an Uber guild who ISN'T
wearing Velious quest armour, but I doubt it.
