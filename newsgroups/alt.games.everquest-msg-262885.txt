The exclusive sale of droppable items puts a substantial premium on them 
and their spawn points. We've already got numerous examples of 
professional farmers who monopolize the single spawn point for an item 
to both maximize their odds of getting them, and minimize the odds of 
anyone else getting one without paying them for it. 

That clearly harms the game, and the players who do not participate in 
the outside game economy.

Precisely. All of the above. Its never none of the above. Its never, 
lets do this endlessly for the sheer joy of killing mobs.

I already conceded that you might do it once "just to see it". Like a 
movie you'll go once just to see it. But how many times would you return 
to a zone you've already seen if there was 0xp, 0items, 0pp?

People will burn out the content in no time flat if they only have a use 
for it once, and if the only use is "because it was there".

And a waste of time for those that are spending money on the game. A 
pointless time sink to get them "somewhere else" with no intrinsic 
entertainment value. (Most PL/grinders are not particularly fun to be 
around, ime)

I'm stipulating that the game is EQ :), and that the only reasons to 
kill a mob are 1) to see it die, and 2) to loot it. And 1) is only 
entertaining for a very short period of time.

I noted you opened by restricting your 'saleable items' to droppables, 
and consistently argued that it was a means for players to skip the 
early game and get right into the late game, where everything is no 
drop, and they will have to camp and earn every further upgrade.

Therefore it follows that if I make droppable items good to up to level 
60, then these players will be able to 'skip' up to level 60 and then 
"start playing". If I (as a 'game designer') make droppable items good 
up to level 10 then they can skip up to level 10 and start playing.

I found this interesting for two reasons:

1) If the players are in a race to reach a part of the game where the 
'game really starts' where they have to camp and farm each no drop 
upgrade... if that's the part of the game they *want* to get to, if 
that's what they find *fun*... why not just do it from level 1. Why the 
need to skip the early levels at all.

2) Why make anybody play the first n levels where droppable items are 
good at all. Just have everyone start at 60 or 10 or whatever. If that's 
where the 'REAL GAME STARTS'... then START people *THERE*.

3) If the 'real game starts' where 'droppable gear ends' and 'no drop' 
gear begins, and this is where everyone is in a mad race to get to... 
then all the gear should be no drop. Because its at that point that the 
game apparently becomes fun.


Some one suggested a no-drop only server. I'm beginning to think its a 
great idea. I only wish it existed before I wasted so much time leveling 
characters on other servers... I'd sure like to move them over.
