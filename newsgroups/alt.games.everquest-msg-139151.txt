lol, and in this post, and the other reply, 2 
people have summed up a long standing discussion 
at the Magician's Tower.

The real answer - It depends.

It depends on your level, and your play style.
Up to 55, evoc has been good to me, probably
be even better to a non grouping mage.

56+, for a solo mage, Evoc is still decent
(the rains, and bolts are more useful in those
situations, and they are still evoc.)  However,
if you chaincast, or use the 52 pet heal much,
conjuration starts to gain ground.

56+ for raiding/grouping mages, where bolts are
hard to use (LOS issues) and rains are problematic,
(mez issues), and given that the top 2 dd's of a
60 mage are Conj. based shocks.  Also given the 
immense (IMMENSE) utility of Mod Rod 2's, and 
conjuration becomes a clear winner.

I'm going to respec at 56, but then, that's just
me.  (to conjuration)
