    I have to admit, I've posted more than my fair share of off topic
stuff, as has been alluded to already in the replies to this thread, but I
can't say that I really remember catching much grief over it.  I guess I
know people!

   I don't know that I'd  call the CoH posts to be completely off topic
though.  I mean, yes, they obviously are in the sense that this is an
Everquest newsgroup and CoH is plainly not Everquest.   But even so, the
discussions that are going on here are basically about how Everquest
players relate to this new MMORPG in comparison to EQ.  

   Of course, I might just be spliting hairs now.  I've very tired, and
probably not at my most sensible.  I'll have my people look into it.
