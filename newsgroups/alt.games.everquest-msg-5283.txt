How do You want to spend Your time?
    Monks are best at "pulling". That is grabbing an enemy and taking it
back to the group where he helps to kill it. You are always pushing your
buttons. You are going to learn the floorplan of every dungeon and the
location of every spawn in the joint. It's a hell of a job sometimes. If you
screw up you will likely kill everyone in your group. If your group gets in
trouble it is also your job to try and take the aggro, perhaps fight to the
death to allow your group to escape. Since you can Feign Death (play dead)
you can often buy your group time to make it to a zone to safety.
    Clerics spend lots of time sitting and lookin at the spell book. You
watch the health of the members of the group and keep them all in good
fighting condition. You provide some good buff spells on others and heal
them when they need it. At higher levels, a cleric can almost always find a
group and is very popular. As a cleric, you can resserrect the dead ( at
higher levels) which restores some lost experience and save them from
perhaps a long run from thier bind point to the place of death.
    Either class is very good. In fact, properly played, any class in the
game can be the hero. When creating your character, pay attention to which
races have the best beginning stats for your class choice and use your extra
points wisely. You only have one chance to do this part and you dont get
anymore points later.

have fun
