Thanks everyone for the wonderful information about the Juggs...it's a big
help.  Turns out that a 65 cleric/sk pair that we are friends with wants
to camp that area for that wood elf illusion mask, so add evac and maybe
CC (though doesn't sound necessary) and we're golden!

We had just finished the big battle for the 8th iksar shaman cudgel.  I
would guess that the bard having at least 4-5 mobs under CC while probably
twisting extra songs all in a tight area was responsible, though it is
also possible that the other group of 3 people in the zone at the time did
something.

I probably should start a "let's talk about Drusella" thread, since my
husband needs the urn now (and we had a lot of firepower with us we won't
have as a duo), but it'll have to wait.  Too much information all at
once. :P

By that time I'll probably have about 2650hp unbuffed and 1060 ac or so,
so slap Focus of Soul and 62 ranger buffs on that and you get some
idea. I haven't had a chance to get any AA yet...*starts drooling when she
realizes that the cords and ND3 will give her 3khp unbuffed*  A 171 hitter
that is slowed doesn't make me batt an eyelash at this point, only doing
so in an uncontrolled situation


What class are you again Faned?
