Monsters that do more for progression are worth more DKP. Pretty
simple actually. Our system goes from 0.25 to 2 per ubermob. A full
clear of fire minis (all ten) is worth 4.5, for example (front birdies
only 0.25 each). Fennin is worth 2 by himself. Backflags that require
fairly heavy numbers for us (like Rallos) are also still at 2. Mobs
that no longer have any real impact on advancement (like AoW) are
worth nothing and are not done on raid nights. Only official raids on
raidnights give dkp, though official raids off of raid nights can have
loot *cost* dkp even though they don't give any (great for keeping
inflation in check).

I'm surprised more top guilds don't use dkp over merit. I hear of
people saying they "put their name in" and shudder.
