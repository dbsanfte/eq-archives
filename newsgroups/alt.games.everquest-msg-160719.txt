I had this happen to me once two days ago. I was attempting to log on during
what seemed to be a lot of lag.
It took a while to register my login, and sometimes I didnt even get that
far. Then on the 4th or 5th try, it had me down as having all expansions
registered, while I still yet havent purchased PoP.
Was only a short lived thing though - next login it was back to normal. I
didnt get a chance to see what happened if I attempted to zone to a PoP
zone, as the Linkdeath bug got me 5 minutes into the game.
