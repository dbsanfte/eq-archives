I was wondering if anyone could possible spill some secrets on getting a
large pp flow....I was reading earlier a bard can make 4k per day.

I know some people who have methods but will not share them with me as they
dont want the places they go to to be over-run. I figure there are not too
many Aussies on Druzzil Ro so I wont be interfering too much.

So any one got any good ideas to make good cash? I am a 65 cleric and my BF
is a 65 wizard (I often help him kite by keeping him alive when the snare
breaks or he snares himself - he is a doofus).
