I find it faster to use the mouse 90% of the time; I'm often chattering 
away while I play, as a bard this may mean type click type click click 
type click type enter, just to get one line out... but if I try to use 
hotkeys I can end up with the good old
=>
/g so bob what do you 2 2 think about... ah crap sorry you died, I meant 
to mez that mob for you, consent and I'll drag.

type of event.

I also have primary and secondary and three open inventory slots in my 
hotkey bank, which means a whopping 5 of them are filled with things 
that must be moused not typed.  I keep my current melody in another of 
the slots, and if I want to actually twist myself, I use the mouse on 
the spell bar.  Since that melody is in the hotkey bar, I can always 
keep it up while using the mouse for something else... but thats not my 
normal approach.

Then I have about 10 other melodies set up in the social bank, right 
there next to the hotkey bank, so I can switch gears fairly easily.  If 
it seems to be something I'm going to be doing regularly for a while, I 
swap that social in to that hotkey slot.

I can see how under certain circumstances hotkeying could be faster, but 
its far less reliable, for me, than just clicking on what I want to do.
