Subject: What do i get at (200) fishing skill?

I am assuming the skill max for fishing is 200, if not, assume my question
means the highest skill for fishing.

I just recently started fishing, and got my skill to (9), and i seem to catch
something  1 out of every 5-10 casts. Im curious, i caught rusty daggers, fish,
somethin called timorous tuna, not worth much, but cool to get for free.

My question is, what kind of things do you catch if your skill is the highest u
can get in fishing? Thanx
