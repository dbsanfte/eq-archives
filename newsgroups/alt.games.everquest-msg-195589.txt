Buy a Burtwood staff.  On your horse you get med benefits while
staff nuking.  

Also, since you duo with another pet class, consider Improved
Reclaim - it hurts your pet canni a bit (not hugely), but allows
you to reclaim that nearly dead pet for more mana than it takes
to summon a new one.  In the time it takes the cleric to CH your
pet you can reclaim, resummon and send it in and be in the middle
of casting BOIV.  Yeah, he lacks a muzzle/swords of walnan -
but the fact that you spend <100mana to replace a nearly
dead pet with a new one with a new burned out one, instead
of the cleric spending 320 (scm3, specalt) to 360 (just spec
alt) to CH it makes a huge difference. 

It hurts pet canni - now the best you can do is any Gvoc
pet (base mana 400) -40 for spec conj, -40 more for scm3
and as much as -100 more for the enshrouded veil. and get
back 360-380 so 140-160 mana per reclaim.  You'll never
have the insane pet canni of Son of Rathe - but very few
people will ever see that so..................
