   I ran across this link,
http://archive.salon.com/tech/feature/2000/11/21/virtual_suicide/print.html
on the CoH forums.  Still being interested in EQ, I followed it, and found
it rather interesting.  It describes a hoax EQ suicide and the uproar it
caused in the EQ community.  All in all I found it to be an interesting
read, and more balanced than articles of this nature tend to be.

   But...  I've not heard of the hoax or uproar till now.  Have any of
you?  Or have I just grown more distant from the EQ community than I
thought I had?
