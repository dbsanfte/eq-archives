No, we agree completely that the d2 solution is not a solution for a 
MMOG. I'm merely defending blizzard's 'lack of attention to the rampant 
greifing problem' in D2 because its really a non-issue.

I actually played primarily in public games, unless I doing something 
particularly dangerous. (e.g. eg The Ancients...) and that just because 
I didn't want someone to join at an inopportune moment and lag the game 
or make it harder.

To an extent I think a lot of people like being in an world with a lot 
of players 'around' but don't particularly care to hunt with them. 
(witness the popularity of soloing, and the number of people who -like- 
doing it, not doing it "because they can't find a group".)

I don't know that its a 'showstopper' for me. But I agree with your 
points with respect to WoW.
