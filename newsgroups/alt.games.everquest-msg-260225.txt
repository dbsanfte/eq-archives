Just out of curiosity, why on earth would you run to HHK from Qeynos when 
you have the books at your disposal?

I am not one of those that waits around for a port, particularly not to 
such an accessible spot.  If I am headed to Western Wastes, I'll often 
ooc paying "100pp for a port/tl to CS", if I get any responses within 30 
seconds or so great, if not, I start running.  It's actually really not 
that far to run with the move of PoM zone in to GD.
