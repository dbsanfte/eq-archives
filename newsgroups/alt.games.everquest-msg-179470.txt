Thank ya kind sir... at present I just put them end to end in a word
Document and saved as an HTML.  My web editing skills are at a
minimal, but its in a good format to print and read at leisure.

feel fee to take a look and if you notice a story missing... let me
know. I did a search at Google and put in all I found.
