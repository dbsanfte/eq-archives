As to what use rogues are, don't be an idiot.  There are a number of places
that you absolutely must have a rogue for, to get in, and a rogue deals out
a boatload of damage.  I regularly group with a rogue, and it is amazing
just how much faster mobs go down if you have a rogue instead of another
warrior for example.
