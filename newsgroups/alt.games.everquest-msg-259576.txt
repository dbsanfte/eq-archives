I don't think it's a custom display, what do you mean?  Custom colors?
No.  Just set to higher than the laptop screen can handle because most
of the time it's docked to a monitor.  And I get the same problems
when docked.

It's odd, maybe I'm just lucky?  My 2.6GHz P4 with 1gb ram and ATI
AIW9700 runs like an absolute dream, anywhere.  I even run wineq with
2 sessions and it only slightly drags in PoK.  Maybe this is as good
as it gets on a non-gaming laptop?

Damn.
