Fuck me, Usenet has deteriorated, with cretinous dullards like this cunt
and their nonsensical ramblings posted *above* the quoted text like some
ill-educated monkey-boy.

Moron, lemme make it clear to you.

Monks have not been "tweaked", "tuned" or "coloured" or "adjusted".
They have had a *fundamental* change to the entire ethos of the class 4
*years* after the class was implemented.  That's not just wrong in terms
of the game and what you do or do not think the class should be, it's a
fucking idiotic and *wrong* way to deal with customers in this type of
game.  You simply cannot redefine a class after 4 years, ever.

You might think there is some reason or justification for it (and you'd
be wrong but that's not relevant) because the time for that argument was
4 years ago.  The bottom line is that Verant *do not* document their
work, a new Development Team is in place and its decision makers have no
frame of referrence and make their own judgement call decisions WITHOUT
DISCUSSION with players of the class.  That's dumb, stupid, moronic,
call it what you will.

That's the core of the problem here.  It is also quite unprecedented in
the game and I'm pretty sure a lot of potential customers of future
Verant products will remember that this is a company which will do such
things.  And for a huge investment game like an MMORPG that is a
dangerous message to give.
