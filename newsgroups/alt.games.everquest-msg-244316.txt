No argument.  But the best rogue you could be might have the skill 
necessary to make and use the relevant poisons that one time in a hundred 
when it would make a significant difference.  You certainly wouldn't use 
them on every mob in a good group, no.  That would be like trying to use 
chanter runes instead of finding a healer. :)

Aye, as I said, the comparison to hybrid spells -is- overstating it a bit.  
Alchemy is a reasonable comparison, sure.  Except ya can't generally hand 
poisons to someone else to use, the way you can with potions.
