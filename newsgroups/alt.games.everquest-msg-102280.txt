/agree
Now for my $.01 ($.02 is to much)
If you are going to get your undies in a wad because someone uses shorthand
you have problems.  Most people don't type 80wpm (hope that doesn't wad your
undies) or even 40wpm for that matter.  I can type faster than 40wpm, I use
plz, ty, and all the other petty little short hand words that piss most of
you off.  The fact is the majority of people are lazy, and I'll be the first
to admit I am.  However, most people play this game to have fun, not to be
in English class.  FYI---EQ is not a formal document, or business letter.

Has NE1 (sorry couldn't resist) looked at a brochure for instant msgs (doh!
did it again) for cell phones?  They have pages of definitions for
shorthand.  These abbreviations are becoming part of modern society, either
deal with it or get over it.  You might even try it sometime, you might like
it.
