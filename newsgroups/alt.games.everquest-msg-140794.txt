It raises some melee stats while dropping your wis and int, if you
don't cast spells, and can cope with the blurry vision, being drunk
can make you a better fighter.  AT increases your resistance to
the stat dropping, which also increases how drunk you can get
without getting all dizzy.  All in all, though, the effects are minimal
and not worth the effort, unless you enjoy it.

Happily you didn't ask how the exp is split.. that part is quite complex.
But as for your question, how much exp is there to be split, thats simple.

You get a 5% bonus for each extra member of your group.  So to make
things simple, lets imagine a group of wizards, all the same level and race.
One wizard kills the 200 xp mob, he gets 200 xp.  Two wizards kill it, they
each get 105xp.  Three wizards each get 73xp, four wizards each
get 57xp, five wizards get 48xp, six wizards get 41xp.  Assuming they
have unlimited mobs and can kill just as quickly in terms of mobs per
hour as they could solo (lets say 10 mobs per hour per wizard) then
you'd see them getting 2000xp per hour soloing, 2100xp each per
hour in pairs, 2200xp each per hour in trios, 2300xp per hour for
four of them (and the other two forced to pair up), 2400xp per hour
each for five of them (and the remaining guy soloing) and 2500xp
per hour each if they all group.

As you can see, there is no special "full group bonus", its better
than a five man group, but only by the same margin that five is
better than four.

Things that affect this; I said unlimitted mobs.  If you can't find enough
things to kill, then fewer group members are better.  Look at the
per kill figures and this is easy to see... although here the interesting
thing is that at high end of the scale, the drop in exp per mob is
minimal.  While finding a partner and then killing the same number
of mobs per hour that you could solo is a huge drop in xp, going
from five to six players costs practically nothing per mob.

Kill just as quickly.  Wizards are a good example class for this;
their damage stacks neatly, so you have no reason to think they
will kill more slowly or more quickly grouped.   Other classes
may find their best kill per hour strategy less effective in a group,
where DOTs, for example, tend not to work very well.  Most
classes, though, find their effectiveness actually multiplied by
grouping with other classes that fill in the holes in their abilities.
A good pair should be able to kill not just as many mobs as the
two soloing, but twice, three times that many mobs.  This is
where the "real group bonus" comes in to play, if there are mobs
enough, your group should be able to kill not 20, 30, 40 mobs
per hour, but 30, 60, 80 mobs per hour... or similarly to kill
higher level mobs in the same quantitites you could soloing the
low level ones.
