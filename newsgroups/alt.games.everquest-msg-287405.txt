Loved to pull during LDoN era with my Cleric.  :)
Man,you should see how uninteresting pulling is in EQ2,it's the 
TANK's job,there is exactly *one* technique,tank approaches
a group of mobs and hopes not to get too much aggro.
1 pulling class + 1 technique surely makes for great diversity,lol.
Sorry for hijacking a thread about EQ1 and Wow,but I still cant 
get over how unbeleivably they have dumbed down the game play in EQ2.
Thinking that they took my monthly fees from EQ1 to develope
this piece of boring crap still makes me want to pull my hairs out.
Just entered a 2nd phase in only 5 months with a seriuos burn out -
I deleted EQ2 from my harddisk 2 days ago,note a rl friend let me
play for FREE on his 2nd account.
