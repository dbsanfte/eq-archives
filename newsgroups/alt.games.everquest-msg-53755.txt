You went to the safe spot in the zone, when you sit to camp, it moves
you slightly so on logging back in, you would have been in the wall,
hence it moves you to 0,0 to keep you from being stuck in the wall.

This is a bug/feature.  Because of a spell or something landing as you
entered the zone you would have died, since you are between zones, you
can't die, but it thinks you are dead, Since you can't stay a corpse in
limbo it moves you to a safe spot in the zone (usually 0,0), but your
buffs are gone as technically you were dead briefly.  Kinda like when
you're hear stops and you stop breathing for some reason, and htey
restart your heart via cpr or the paddle things.  Technically you were
dead briefly, but your not actually dead.
