I am looking for a good 2HS weapon for my new berserker, he is level 4 and I
have about 200 pp to spend but am not sure what to get him.  Any help would
be appreciated.  Preferably wanting something that will be good for the next
20 or 30 levels.  Do not want to spend more than 1k but I will go up to 1k
when I get it heh heh.  Thanks in advance.
