I'm attempting to get the pally bone in Phinegals lair by using the
ole "go naked and invised" trick.  I'm doing it solo because no one in
my guild (nor anyone else for that matter) wants anything to do with
Kledge.  The place is totally empty along with Dragnors and Unrest. 
They say that the quest isn't worth the effort and they are probably
right but it's a pally quest and I'm a pally and that's what we
pally's do or at least we make a couple attempts at it before we
accept reality.  Anyway, I got down to the Patriarch room � the one
just before Phinny's - with no problems.  But now I'm stuck.  I can't
find the tube to Phinnys room.  According to the maps at AllaKhazams,
it is in the northeast corner.  There is just a square pot there with
a couple of weeds growing out of it. I've looked high and low � on the
sides of the pot, on the floor besides the pot, on the walls, on the
ceiling, in the mud but no tube.  Can anyone help me out?  Is there
some thing I should click on or push or something?  Thanks
