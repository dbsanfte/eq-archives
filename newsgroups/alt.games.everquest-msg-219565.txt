/agree

I'm not talking about fun banter with your guildies. I don't think any
class is exempt there.  I think what irked me most about the serverwide
auction channel bit isn't that I was *insulted*...dear gods, those folks
are usually the runny-nose scum of the server, my standards for being
insulted are a bit higher...but that they were so blatantly stupid and
wrong.  So it caught my attention insasmuch as big pile of dung on my head
would make me go "AGH GETIFOFF GETITOFF!!!"  I wanted to bitchslap the lot
of them.  (I often want to bitchslapp that channel though, so I guess it's
nothing new.)

But then I asked myself...waitaminute, what if they aren't wrong? What if
there is a rash of stupid rangers out there, not stupid
ranger-bashers...so I came here to ask. :D And if we are indeed the new
twink class of the time, then yes, I guess there might be a lot of stupid
rangers out there.

I would also venture to say that Rangers are a class that the roleplayers
and the "Oh, I just like to spend time with my friends, I don't care about
gear" sorts often play.  As such, they may not have the most super-duper
gear, and they may be somewhat carefree about learning their class.  Which
leads to a lot of rangers being nice people who really do sorta...fall
over fast, but laugh while they do it.
