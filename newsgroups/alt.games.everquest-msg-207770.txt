Do you mean a built-in video card on the motherboard? IF so, that is
probably most of your problem.

Yes.

I have a 1.3Ghz Athlon, with 512MB of RAM. When it had a GF2 64MB in
it ran well enough, sometimes I would see some lag outside the Bazaar,
but very rarely.

Now I have a 128MB Radeon 9500 in this particular box, it runs super
smooth at 1280x1024 with ALL graphic options and effects turned on.
The ONLY time and place I see lag in EQ is in the Baz.
 
The most common cause of ANY game crashing to the desktop is the sound
card. Everytime I have had a game that crashed to the desktop whether
it was EQ, AC, AC2, DAoC, Mechwarrior, BF1942, NWN, etc. the problem
was the sound card.

Most motherboards come with a built in AC'97 compatible sound system.
These don't really support hardware acceleration, even though the
manufacturer claims they do. They are particularly prone to problems
with newer games like AC2 or NWN. You may have to turn the HW accel
all the way off to prevent lag and crashes.

The basic strategy for reducing crashes is to turn the sound hardware
accel down a notch and try it again until you find a level you can
live with. Use the 'dxdiag' utility that comes with DirectX to adjust
the accel on the sound system. Even with a high-end Sound Blaster, you
may still have to reduce the level of accel to minimize crashes.

EQ transmits very little data between the server and the client once
you are in a zone, especially compared to more recent games like
BF1942. A friend of mine played EQ on a 28.8 connection going through
NetZero with no problems. But I do recommend that you get an external
modem if you don't have one already.

Get you an ATI or GF video card with 64 or 128 Meg of RAM and tweak
your sound settings, that should make the game playable again.

Good Luck
