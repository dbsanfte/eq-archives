When rogues use their pp skill, does that take plat/items away from
the mob that other characters could get or is it separate somehow?  I
used to hear that pick pocketing was stealing from others in your
group and then I heard somewhere else that someone from Sony explained
that it was separate and didn't affect what the group got.  I haven't
been able to find an answer anywhere..I want to practice my pp skill,
but I don't want to steal from my group!
Thanks,
~rav
