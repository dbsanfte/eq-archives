While reading the first half of your reply, I was ABOUT to reply with some
numbers for you, but fortunately you're willing to do some math.  I take
serious issue with these numbers you supplied.

The Captian can do a lot more than 120 dmg per 2 seconds. Twice that in
fact.  He does 120 dmg per 1 second.  (I know this, because I've taken that
kind of dammage from him, and I had an AC over 900.)

In addition, our chanter was fully buffed with Naltron's symbol.  He had
somewhere on the order of 1200 HP(Resulution, Naltron's Symb, and various
+HP items.  A well-twinked chanter.  I never cast the Armor spells on
casters, since extra defense and AC doesn't help them one bit.)

First of all, Celestial Healing itself takes 4 seconds to cast.  Now, at a
rate of 120 dmg per second, our chanter theoreticly has 10 seconds to live.
Cele healing itself only does 31.1 healing ever second.  If I see any
caster's health droping fast, casting Cele healing on the caster is
guarenteed to kill the caster.  Again, I'm sitting experience on this.  I
have unfortunately killed casters this way, and I learned my lesson.

When you figure in transcontinental delay (the time it takes the network
packets to get to my computer and tell me the chanter is dying.  This
doesn't always happen as quickly as you might think.)  And unless I'm
looking directly at the chanter and seeing that he's being beaten on, I
won't know he's in trouble until his red health meter starts moving...which
means I now have somewhere on the order of 6 seconds to react appropriately.
Greater Heal, well that's silly.  it's 3.75 seconds casting time to recover
300 health.  The mob is doing far more dammage per second than that...and
again the chanter is guarenteed to die.

I choose Sup heal in this case, because I will (generaly) have enough time
to cast the spell, and 583 points of health will translate into a lot of
agro, and hopefuly agro the mob to ME, instead of the chanter.  I can take a
lot more hits than a chanter can.  If I can get a Sup heal to land first,
and then follow it up with a Cele heal, that's sometimes enough time to
allow the tanks to come over and taunt the mob off.  But not always.

There are  times when a caster goes down fast.  Casting the lower-level
healing spells won't help, because they don't recover enough HP in time to
help the caster.

- Richard.
