No. The guards come in 2 varieties. Troopers are "LegionOfCabilis", and
crusaders are "CrusadersOfGreenmist" or something like that.
"BroodOfDiZok" is a sarnak faction which everyone loses (like "orc")
Also in Cabilis are "BroodOfKotiz", "CabilisResidents", "SwiftTales", and he
shaman faction (forget its name). Crusader Quarg in the fob gate is on this
faction.

If your corpse is stuck close to KOS guards, then create a mule iksar,
consent him and get him to drag your corpse away. You can consent someone
whether they are online or not. Alternatively, get an invis/comoflague.

Youll need many thousand bone chips to fix your cabilis faction. Having done
it myself, I would say its not worth it realy.
