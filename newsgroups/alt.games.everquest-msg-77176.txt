It is very easy to test faction with Wuoshi without getting killed.  All you
need is a friend who isn't KOS.  Friend goes in and targets, then comes
back to you out at a safe distance (say the entrance to skyshrine?  no,
really just out around the corner is fine.)  you target friend, assist, and
presto, you are targetting Wuoshi too.

Or since you are testing the wolf form faction difference, just target Wuoshi
yourself, run far away, then change forms, since that is a self only spell,
you won't have to target yourself to do it.

Or get a port to Cobalt Scar, where the Wyverns and Drakes are also
on COV faction...  but thats the cowards way out!

Since it only takes a couple days killing in the Arena to get to Ally with COV,
and most people fight in there quite a lot looking for armor drops for Thurg
quests, yes, its minor. Not Trivial, but minor.
