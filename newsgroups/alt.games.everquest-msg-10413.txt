I'm right there with you. I'm much happier baking exotic foods than
relentlessly killing everything in sight, most of the time. It
would be very nice to get some experience from trade skills. I can
see both sides of the coin. To give Verant credit, they've been
making moves towards making the tradeskills more valuable and
interesting. Several important quests involve tradeskills and
the addition of stat-enhancing foods and cultural armor is
making the baking and tailoring/smithing fields more profitable
even if they don't neccesarily gain you XP.

I've sent in a suggestion to Absor that they ought to design
some  "epic quests" related to tradeskills. Something like
an ultra-rare spice that's a required ingredient in some
outstanding recipes, or a special spit or something. Ditto
for the other skills. It could be a quest that could be done
in the mid-twenties or so, that would give the people at the
beginning of the "hell levels" something to focus their
energies on.

It's be fun, anyway. :-)
