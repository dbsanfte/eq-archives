I have to agree with something.. not sure what.  I hate spiders, I will go
out of my way to kill a spider (in RL).  I don't know if what I have is
arachnophobia or an obsession with the death of an entire scientific order
but I see them as completely evil.  I hate them.  But then again, they make
my skin crawl.  I REALLY would rather not see them at all.  If they are on
TV, I'd switch.  I won't watch them, I won't touch them, I'll scrub and
scrub if one touches me.  I'm sick.

Anyway, haha, since I've been playing EQ with all the damn spiders in it, I
haven't been nearly as obsessive about spiders in RL.  I've actually let
smaller ones live.  I'll see one on the wall, think to myself... hrm.. I
could pull this one and solo it... easily.  But, I'll let it live.  Larger
ones, black, evil looking ones.. they still die. And slowly if I can arrange
it... hell, I am getting a little better with them.. but they're still evil.

EQ HAS helped my fear of heights a bit though as well.  I still get a little
dizzy at heights, but not nearly so bad now.  Especially since I've been
playing a rogue and have mastered safe-fall.

Ah.. safe-fall.. ;)
