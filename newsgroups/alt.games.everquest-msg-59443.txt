Robes will tend to overwrite anything else you're wearing. If you want
a caster chest item that lets other gear show, you'll need to grab
something like a white scale tunic or the netted kelp piece. The first
costs between 300 and 500 plat and the netted kelp several thousand.

To my knowledge, there is no back piece that shows for INT casters.
OTOH, your head piece, if it has a graphic, will always show. Too bad
the most prevalent one looks like a melted Hershey's kiss.
