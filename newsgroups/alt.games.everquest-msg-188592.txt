I did
.
Let me clarify:

The original world is empty.  Therefore it's difficult to find a
group in most locations.  If you want to level the answer
everyone gives you is the same: Paludal Caverns, except that's
not in the original game.  While I suppose it is possible to solo
or pick-up group yourself up to fifty in the original world, it
would be a really interesting and frustrating experience I am
sure.  The point is that the high-level game pretty much requires
all the expansions and the mid-level game is much more difficult
without the expansions -- to the point of being futile.  So when
I say restricted to the lower level game I mean 1-25 or so.
Above 25 really needs regular groups and guilds (I know it's
possible to solo up there, but it's also not a lot of fun to me)
and most guilds are off in the expansions these days getting
their flags, whatever that is.

I do know that when I purchased SoV the impact on my system was
such that I decided not to buy any more expansions until I get a
new PC.  Well, it's some time later and I still have my old pc --
the waving trees in Velious are really just a little too much for
my Voodoo 3 and the framerate gets objectionable.  I know I'm
whining, but I do long for the old world where there were plenty
of people around and if you wanted to buy something with your
hard earned plat you didn't have to fly to the moon.

PD
