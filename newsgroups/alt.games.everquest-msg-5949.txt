Just posted this to another thread, but I would heartily concur with Bishop.
I went from a 200MHz MMX Pentium with 64MB to a 800MHz PIII with 256MB, both
using a 56k modem with a best connect speed of 26.4k thanks to my favorite
baby bell, Qwest.  Made an amazing difference.  I kept the same Voodoo video
card with both machines.  I also went from Win95 to Win2000, only problem I
have had with that is choppy sound, but heck, I keep it turned way down so
as not to disturb others anyway.
