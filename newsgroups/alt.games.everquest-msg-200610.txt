Being a Cleric has its ups and downs

Up
-- You hardly ever have to use LFG for more than 20min
-- You are always appreciated by your group members and you always
feel like you are contributing something useful.
-- You get to go many places 4-5 levels earlier than the Melee folk
(i.e., PoD at 50 instead of 55)
-- Your guild is always asking you to raid with them
-- You're always being asked to rez or buff someone (usually for
money)
-- Your epic isn't too hard to get

Down
-- It can be repetitive. Heal, Sit, Med. Rinse/Repeat. One you get
into the Planes the boredom/repetitiveness goes away because you
reallly need to pay attention here. You also get nukes and stuns that
you can use when you're on KEI.
-- Post 44 you will start to spend alot of money on spell reagents
(Peridots/Pearls), so you will need to make up for this expense.
-- You can't solo effectivley (unless it's undead, and even then the
exp is slow). Unless you're really anti-social this shouldn't be a
problem.
-- Post 50, you will be bugged alot for buffs and rezzes. However,
these are good ways to make money. Alot of Clerics on my server sell
Temperance for 20pp a cast in PoK and my 96% rezzes sell for about
100pp (Epic).


Some words of advice
-- Buy a cheap horse or lizard (Drogmor?) as soon as you can. It has
helped me tremendously with medding
-- If you can't devote 100% of your attention to your group while
playing, don't be a Cleric
-- Try to entertain as many requests for a rez as possible. This will
do wonders for your reputation.
-- Again, if you like to solo, don't be a Cleric
