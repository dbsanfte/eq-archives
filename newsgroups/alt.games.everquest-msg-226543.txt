Because Bards are good for more than just pulling or being mana batteries.

You weren't there, folks, don't judge.  I've turned over pulling duties
plenty of times no matter how badly I wanted to pull because I knew someone
else was better.  He was not ubiquitiously better in this case.  (I just
deleted two paragraphs on this because it's not the point of my post.)

This isn't even about who was pulling, it was about the fact that some third
party from his guild sent me a tell telling me to stop something I hadn't
even done.   I only bothered to give the background I did because otherwise,
people would've gone, "What'd you do to deserve it?" rather than focusing on
my actual question which was, "Is this normal?"

I guess I got too chatty and put out too much.  My bad.

From now on, I use hypotheticals.

And there's the whole point of it, finally.  I've seen higher third parties
step in to explain techniques or give advice, but never for something like,
"Don't complain about agro."  My only real complaint is that apparently, it
was painted that I was doing something that I *wasn't* doing.  If someone's
going to bitch about me, they should at least be accurate. ;)
