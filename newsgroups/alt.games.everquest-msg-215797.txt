   Yeah, when I need assistance, I use every available channel.  Like
the time my bl on test got stuck under the work in Beholders Maze, and
spent 3 days perma mezzed, locking me out of logging on any character on
that account, on any server.  I logged on another account and
petitioned, emailed the GM, posted on my server's message board and
cried so pitifully I had other people petitioning for me.  I was on test
which crashes often... I crashed and got rebooted that way before I ever
got a GM.  But I do know that at least the CS staff knew about my
plight.
