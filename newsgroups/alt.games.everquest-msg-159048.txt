Well a few methods...

1) use a monk to FD pull
2) use a SK to pull
3) try with the necro again, FD doesnt always fail
4) tank the adds (if number of melees permits)
5) group with an enchanter for crowd control
6) group with a bard for crowd control
7) group with a necro for crowd control (screaming terror)
8) kite the adds - a druid, a ranger, a wizard
9) root the adds - paladin, shaman, cleric, druid, chanter, ranger, wizard,
etc..
10) experiment with the spell/method your using to pull...

Ok, theres 10 ways off the top of my head.

What was the question again?
