Heh, see if they'll start making kim bab as well.

While my mouth may agree, my tummy says otherwise.  Seafood and I aren't on
the best of terms anyways, so I have to limit my sushi intake.  Of course,
every once in a while, I cheat, and order sushi at the Korean restaurant.
Anwyn and I are the only ones who eat it, but it's still good.  Plus, sushi
in Korean soy is a special treat.

Heh, try Korean, and you may change your tune.  I still go to the Kappa Naro
occasionally, but I keep coming back for bimbim bab.
