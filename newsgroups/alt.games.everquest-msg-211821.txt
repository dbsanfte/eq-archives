As the owner of a 46 ranger and a 55 druid, I'd tend to agree here.  I'd
much rather do the Pull-and-Peel thing with my ranger, then get behind and
go DPS crazy.  The problem is that unless there's an SK as MT, I tend to
regain aggro.  Warriors and Pallys (at least the ones I've grouped with)
can't hold aggro and I end up stealing it, even when I stop kicking and
casting.

Don't know if it's me or them, but I'd sure love for it to stop.  My little
acrylia chain wearing butt keeps getting worn out, while the plate wearing
guys are just flailing away.
