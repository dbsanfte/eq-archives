I read at the EQLive site that the newest server they will be coming out 
with (the one named after a player) may not allow incoming characters to 
be transfered over to it because SOE got so many complaints about their 
letting it be flooded with level 65 chars just 6 months after it 
opening.

They were touting server saying how wonderful it would be that it was 
fresh and new and you could start a new character and be the first to 
explore the zones there -- then 6 months later they would "ruin the 
lands" with a flood of high-level 60+ characters from other servers.  If 
the virtues they were touting were true (about the freshness of the 
server) then obviously the latter part is also true (screwing it up with 
an inflood of high-level chars).

It was depressing to many that the last server named something like 
Mar-- Starpyre let people transfer over to it immediately from day one.  
I started a char on it and then looked around and BOING -- some level 65 
people already.

Those of you who are in support of a FRESH server with no imported 
characters should post your support here and at their EQLive forums so 
they will get the message.  It is FUN living life on a new server, 
watching everybody and try to outrace eachother in the leveling game.
