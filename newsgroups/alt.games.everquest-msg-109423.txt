So the only way Salk can NOT be evil in this hypothetical is to
sacrifice is own life to save the children, thusly causing the polio
vaccine to be lost and making millions of OTHER children to suffer
from polio because one of these two children MIGHT discover the cure
for cancer?

Hell, lets just throw out the Salk end of the hypothetical there and
say that I am trapped in a burning building with these two children.
I can either get out myself, leaving the kids, or save the kids and
die.  So, if I decide to obey EVERY SINGLE NATURAL INSTINCT I have to
save my ass, I'm evil?  The only way I cannot be evil is to decide
that my life is worth LESS than these kids?
