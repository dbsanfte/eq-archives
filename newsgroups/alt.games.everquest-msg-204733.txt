Based on my limited data Wednesday then Sunday
However these are based on UK time (BST) so Sunday am starts mid Sat night 
for the USA.

Time seems much more important the hours between midnight and 5am BST (so 
23:00 and 04:00 GMT) are considerably better for selling.

The main difference is how many other of the same / similar items are 
selling. I have noticed this most of Jasper Gold Earrings.

I have sold 73 in the last month or so with prices ranging from 35pp down 
to 20pp. If there is no one else with a bulk sale going on I can easily 
shift them for 30pp and sometimes for 35pp. However once there are one or 2 
other jewelers selling the price plummets to 20-25pp. Whis still isn't bad 
since it costs me about 12pp to make them.

I have seen the same thing happen on other items too. There also seems to 
be a case of demand effecting supply very quickly and significantly. 
Players seem to react very fast to the fact that item xxx is high. Then 10 
of them go out and camp it/ quest it. A week later it is down to half the 
price. Every one stops camping it and the price slowly recovers.

It is definatly worth watching the market for a while before either buying 
or selling. And it may be very benificial to wait before selling.

Fine Antique ring is a great example of this. Costs about 50pp to 
buy/quest. Yet I sometimes see prices as high as 500pp for the ring. 
However once prices reach this price there is a quick flurry of activity 
and the price drops. I have seen as many as 20 of these for sale as low as 
175pp. (I quested mine :-)

Note that this is all on FV so YMMV.
