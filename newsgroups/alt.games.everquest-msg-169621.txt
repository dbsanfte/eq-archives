never actually been here, but i hear it's nice.  thinking about trying
it out with my druid and girlfriend's monk.

> Dalnir

same thing as CC.

> Solusk Eye (Sol A)

this is a fun zone, and you're at a good level where it'll be a
challenge.  lots of fine steel weapons in here (try to pick up a weight
reduction bag if you can at all find one within your means), along with
some nice caster gear makes for decent loot as well.

> Merus Seru

not a big fan of this zone.  was here in my early 20s with a group of
twinks killing reds and seeing like no xp.  not to mention no loot.

> Mistmoore

this is a great zone.  you can make a bit of coin selling the essence of
moonlight you pick up to high elven smiths.  and with many spots where
it's very difficult to single pull, will be a nice challenge :)
