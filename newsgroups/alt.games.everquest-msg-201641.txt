<snip lots of stories about people playing D&D>

For those of you who haven't seen this...classic..

http://www.cybermoonstudios.com/8bitDandD.html

As I mentioned in an earlier thread, I had the unusual experience of being
the DM for an all-woman campaign.  Some amazing memories...one of the
players accidentally shot her own wolf companion with an arrow and killed
it...we spent the next 30 minutes bawling our eyes out.  One of my friends
discovering after 2 years of playing that the "mysterious mercanary
captain" she had been working with was her own father, who was presumed
dead (her family has a curse that all who are close to them will die, so
she was a very lonely sort).  She spent the rest of the evening saying
"oh my god...oh my god..." It was a frickin' soap opera at times, but
it was grand.  *wipe away nostalgic tears*  

I did try a group of folks in S.F. when I first came out here, and
had a fair lot of fun with them, especially with the necro who liked to
animate dead chickens...but I had to give it up becuase I hate driving
into the city so often.  I haven't tried too much since..Rumble's story is
frighteningly accurate in many cases (though the guys in that one group
weren't scary).
