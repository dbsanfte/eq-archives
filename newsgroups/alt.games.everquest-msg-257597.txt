You might want to run the numbers, I suspect that you'd save a lot of 
mana by using CHeal instead of HOTs on your MT, and in that case the 
more HP the MT has, the more true this is.

Lets say your MT has 3200 hp, and you heal him so that your CHeal lands 
at roughly 20%.  That means you heal for 2560.  Buff him up to 4000, 
still heal at 20%, and now you are healing 3200 hp for the same mana, a 
25% improvement in your mana efficiency.

If your DPS people could improve their damage output by 25%, or if you 
could lay your hands on a 25% mana efficiency item, I bet you'd go for 
it in a hurry.

My reply to the OP carefully mentioned not having a 39+ cleric as the 
healer when I said that having more HP didn't really change things on a 
per hour basis; if the cleric is using CHeal (or druid/shaman with 
incomplete heal to some extent) then HP does mean a good deal, and the 
more the merrier.
