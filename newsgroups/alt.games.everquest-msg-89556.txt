True Spirit faction is for the shaman epic quest.  May be for other things
too, don't know.  There are various mobs related to the shaman epic
scattered about Norrath, and the Planes, that are on True Spirit faction.
By doing the shaman epic, you gradually increase your True Spirit faction to
the point of allowing you to complete the next step of the quest.
