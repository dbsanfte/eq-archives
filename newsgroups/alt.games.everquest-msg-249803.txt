:)

I tested that out (it's the programmer in me ... couldn't help myself).  I
could happily click 'Back' and vote as many times as I liked.  The numbers
themselves never updated.  One assumes that they do that periodically.  For
that matter, it could just be a jpeg and the votes hit the ol' bit bucket.

Very true, whether they're on Allakhazam or CNN.com.

To be honest, I usually only used to hit Allakhazam for specifc information
regarding an item or quest.  I never read the body of the site.  I wonder
what percentage of their hits actually took the time to vote at all.

In almost every poll, though, if you give an "Don't Care / No Opinion"
option, those who actually don't care or have no opinion will seldom vote.

I still tend to believe that a decision has been made by SOE on this matter.
They're just trying to wag the dog.
