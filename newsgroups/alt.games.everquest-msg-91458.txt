Took my cat down to kunark to try to find a group and all  the mobs look
human.  Seems like I had this problem before, but I have plenty of memory
now.  All models are off, textures are on.  Tried changing settings, no
help.  Tried deleting the overthere files and reinstalling, but no help.
Anyone have any suggestions?  System is Athlon 800MHz, 768Mb, geoforce2
64MB, winMe.
