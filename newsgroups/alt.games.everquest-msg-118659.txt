Also, even easier to find (and popular for that reason), on the zone
wall right off the canyon leading to EW, not right at the canyon but
along the zone wall a little ways.  Or maybe that works out to the same
spot Jazz is talking about, I used to med while AFK at several locations
along there and never got attacked.  Only real problem is that lots
of folks like to solo near there, so when zone population is up you
have to range out a ways to find anything to kill.  OTOH if you pull
up near the wall there the mobs path right along it when they run and
reverse direction every time you whack them, probably be a real easy
spot to fear kite.


never had a problem.
