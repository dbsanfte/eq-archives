Speaking from my own personal experience:

I quit EQ cuz I was tired of not even being able to solo
blues with my 35 druid without medding for 7 or 8 minutes
afterwords.  Conveniently, DAoC came-out within a month
or two to help satiate my MMORPG fix.

I played DAoC for a while and there are certainly things
that I like about DAoC:  copper auto-converting to higher
currencies (with no weight), keeping equipment when dying
(usually in EQ, you die because mobs are hard - how the hell
are you supposed to get your corpse while NAKED if you
couldn't kill them to begin with), etc.  

I recently quit DAoC, though, and bought another copy
of EQ.

DAoC just seems "boring" in comparison to EQ.  The zones
are all the same, the characters are not really "fantastic"
(in a "fantasy" sense) and are primarily humans, spells
are boring and usually just "spell x 1", "spell x 2" and
they just keep incrementing the number, RvR is horribly
flawed -- if you're not level 40, you can kiss your ass
goodbye in 10 seconds, and despite the fact that "EQ is
losing programmers" (as someone else in this thread said),
DAoC still has no real Relic support, realm points are
totally useless, and dungeons are non-itemized (this one is
REALLY unacceptable after 3 months).  

So, while I gave DAoC a good, solid shot, and I WANTED
to love it because I hated EQ so badly at the time, DAoC
just did not "do it" for me.  I'm enjoying the hell out
of my new ranger on EQ and am looking to sell my DAoC
package, book, and account (if anyone is interested, let
me know).

Mike
