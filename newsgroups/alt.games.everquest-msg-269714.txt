    When I moved to Missouri from California, I assumed I would spend every
winter in total misery.  And make no mistake, when I saw my lawn blanketed
with that foreign white stuff last year I felt like I had wandered onto an
alien landscape.  And I was none to pleased about it.  The other night, I
walked across my yard to check my mail.  It was chilly, but I didn't think
it was that cold, really.  Then I go inside and check the temp (we have a
clock that has an outdoor sensor so it tells inside and outside temp) and
it was 23F.  I was shocked.  Two years ago, I would have been curled up in
a ball sobbing if I were forced into 23F weather.
