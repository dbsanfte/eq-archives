Prefacing this by saying that it's actually designed for a SINGLE group but
we had a couple extra people who wanted to check it out.

2 necros (low 50s)
1 magician (mid-50s)
2 clerics (51,56)
1 druid (60)
1 shaman (mid-50s)
1 enchanter (54)

Druid pulled.

Get invis and zone into Fear 3 at a time.
Turn 90 degrees left, run to south wall, hang a left.  Go HIGH HIGH HIGH on
wall at n1400, p1400.
Camp to chat

When everyone is in chat and safe (no one died) just go back into the game
all at once, group ASAP(!) and wait for wanderers.  It's NOT a SS (safe
spot)...don't be AFK while you enter the game. :)

Necro & mage, cast pets IMMEDIATELY (mage - earth elemental)...voila,
insta-tanks.  Buff 'em up and keep 'em alive.

In the first hour we had just one death, despite the fact that when we
entered the game there happened to be 2 apes and an imp waiting on us.  The
druid immediately charmed an ape as a 3rd pet (damn, they're fine pets, btw)
and the other 2 critters were quickly dispatched.

The death happened because one of the clerics went AFK either right before a
fight with a critter and he was ported about 50' away and no one noticed.
After the fight he aggroed a couple more which promptly killed him and came
looking at us like we were dessert. WRONG.  They quickly died.

After 2.5 hours we cleared about 1/5 of the whole zone (it took about 1.75
hours to "break" the zone) and only on the last fight did a couple of people
die (another guild came in and since we were just playing we decided to
leave).  As the druid was looking for one last pull the shaman went LD so
that left not only crowd control to me (the 54 enc) but also the slowing.

Four critters came into the camp.  I AE mezzed them with no difficulty but
when I cast slow on the first critter (resisted ggrrrr) for some reason it
came awake.  Slow is CRUCIAL in Fear, especially if all you have being hit
are non-tanks. :)   The clerics tried valiantly to keep me alive...kept me
alive at least 30 seconds longer than I expected, and 2 of the critters did
die, but I finally succumbed.

While I was gone the druid started kiting one of the critters, and the other
remained fairly well rooted.  The cleric rez-sticked me out of the way and I
watched as the last two were killed.  The other person killed was the lower
level cleric who was apparently fear'd away from the camp.

All in all I think I got over a blue bubble of experience (for those under
51 that sounds sucky, but at level 54 that's about the best you can hope for
after 2 hours).  A couple of necro stuff dropped, pally boots dropped
(rotted, of course) and that's about it...loot sucked.  I don't think even
any JEWELRY dropped.

BTW no pets died until that last fight either.
