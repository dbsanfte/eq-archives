This may not make sense stat-wise, but what the hell...

I'd stuck with a Fighing Baton/Essence of Dol combo until 40 when I chanced to
win lotto on a Wu stick in CoM.  I had never really worried too much about
armor and weapons since I was outdamaging the tanks anyway.  One day a friend
loaned me a CoT and I gave it right back after a day: too heavy, too slow for
my liking.  Now at lvl 51 with an FBSS/RotWF combo, all I really need is bare
fists or my Wu's in the off hand.  I will, of course, need to switch to a
really good 2hb soon, but I'm in no hurry.

I guess my point is:  as nice as some of this gear is, it's still the monk that
counts.  How many warriors ten levels above you do you know that are willing to
buck-naked duel you?
