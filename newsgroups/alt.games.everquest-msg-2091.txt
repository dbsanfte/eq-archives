You are high enough to get your epic, and you expect handouts and
Freebies?? Help someone out, I'm helping someone out by not destroying
it, Everquest is a pure Capitalist environment with one small factor,
that being, Things don't get destroyed.

Tracker what level?? 12-17?? Ranger, Get a clue, Offer 500 Plat, Hire a
ranger for as many nights as it takes.  Buy a couple Sow Potion Stacks,
and Go with it.  Can't afford 20k, Offer 500, or 1k, Get someone to be
your buddy,

Oh, so you can't figure out how to make 20k in a couple nights?? I'm
level 22 and at 22 the equivalent of 20k is about 500-700pp, I can make
that in 2 nights no trying, no "phat lewt" farming, and no disturbing
someone elses play, 8 hours 2 night, 700pp, Boring, but I can do it,
figure out how to do it for yourself.  Stop whining and grow up.  Ooops,
here it comes, the Newbie flame, I'm waiting.
