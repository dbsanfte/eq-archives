Hehe, you sound like someone interesting to know.

According to my optician, which Ive been seeing various ones for 23
years, Im "just short signed" however, I find that there are some
weird things going on

I found that with what they deemed to be the "right" prescription
everything seemed clear except when I actually came to read things
like road signs, so, sitting at a junction the name on the street
which is what, a few meters away was blurred! I found it hard to
believe that this was actually acceptible.

Im outstandingly short sighted compared to my family, the worst in the
live generations is my Dad at baout -2.5.. where as I stand at
-6.5/-6.75 which is as even the dumbest of people can see, a fair bit
worse.

Id love it if my optician would sit down and actually tell me when
they are staring into my eyes, what they see, what they are looking
for etc.. After all, Ive been fairly careful of them (bar way too much
VDU use) but always needed glasses since I was young.
