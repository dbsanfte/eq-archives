Just a 'curiosity" question on LDoN points, as it really won't matter to 
me in any way, but how are LDoN points divied up?

Does *EVERYONE* in the group get the same number of points, or is it 
personalized based on *YOUR* level?

Also, are thepoints based on a level range (say, 20-30, 30- 40, etc)?  
And if so, how are they awarded for a group that would straddle the 
boundry?  (Of course, if it is indiviualized, it wouldn't matter on tht 
one, would it?)

Just thunked up the question tonight after a successful adventure, and 
had to ask.  

That's all
