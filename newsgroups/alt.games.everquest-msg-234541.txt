Possibly but SoE can afford to take the fight where it needs to be
taken. Why don't they? Probably more afraid of losing and setting a
precedent.

Far better to skip picking a legal fight, and simply banning any
account that engages in eula violations. It would be difficult to
fight being banned from a mmorpg. Particularly if they time it with
the billing cycle (eliminates the 'failing to deliver a purchased
product/service' argument)
