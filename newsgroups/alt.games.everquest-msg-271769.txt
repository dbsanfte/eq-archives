That's open to debate.  The artistic styles are so different between the two
games that it is hard to tell what the WoW engine can do.  It's kind of like
trying to compare Ocarina of Time to Wind Waker.

Take a hippogryph ride in WoW and observe your mount.  There's a lot of
detail in that model, and the motion is much more fluid than anything I've
seen EQ2's engine produce.  Or take a look at outdoor areas.  WoW's have
more things in them.  EQ2 has to resort to fairly barren landscapes (I hope
this is due to engine limits, rather than due to horrible zone design).

(BTW: an interesting thing to do is go find a hiking trail in real life in a
wooded area, and note the density of trees off the trail.  RL woods are far
denser than I've seen in any MMORPG).

Also, this is irrelevant, because Doom 3 runs on Cedega, and its engine is
way ahead of EQ2's engine.

What I want to know is what happened to the EQ2 engine that was used for the
demos around a year or so ago?  In the released EQ2, even turning all
graphics options to their best-looking setting, it doesn't come anywhere
near those demos.  I suppose that given Sony's deceptive EQ2 TV
advertising, it is possible that those demos were all fake, too.
