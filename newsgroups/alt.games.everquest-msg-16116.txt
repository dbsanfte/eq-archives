Y'know, the more I think about this Bard idea the more I'm sold on it!

Think about it:  The melee squad could move at incredible speeds while
invisible!  Bards can snare at a certain point and rogues use their fear
ability.

Do you guys think a Bard and 5 Rogues would work?  Per my original rants,
there are no debuffs but, if played right, resists could be handled by the
fast-moving Bard.

The only other thing I had was that original squad would work from the very
earliest levels.  (Keep me honest, Rogues get BS at lv. 8, right?)  When
does the Bard get snare song and when do Rogues/Bards get their fear?
