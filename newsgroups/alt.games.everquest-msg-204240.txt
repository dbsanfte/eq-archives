Yep, I love my run 3.  I often don't even bother to resow when I am 
soloing, as run 3 is more than sufficient for that purpose.  I do have 
the insta click boots from doing my epic, and, although I do actually 
keep them around, I don't think I've clicked them since shortly after I 
got them.  I certainly don't wear them, other than once in a while if the 
resists are needed.  The main consideration though is that beyond run3 
and regen3, the only other general AA I would consider for some time 
would be the reduced metabolism.

As to an extra spell/buff slot, that is not a consideration really, SoW 
lasts long enough that I don't keep it memmed ever.  I swap it in, cast 
it, swap it out.
