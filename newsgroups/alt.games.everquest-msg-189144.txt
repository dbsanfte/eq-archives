I get the same problem, only had it since reinstall of OS.
I have no problems in anything else so I believe it to be limited only to
EQ.
I would go Dave's suggestion of a conflict, stupidly I haven't looked into
the problem as it is not that common but since I haven't installed the
latest SBLive drivers (which I had on before) and am just using the default
Win2k ones, that one makes sense.

I doubt it is a heat issue in my case.
