So was he a really good chess player or what?

I mean, what the fuck are you posting this inane drivel on a chess
group for?

Yeah, people kill other people; Given what men are, the question is
why doesn't it happen more often?

Since the only fact that sets this case apart from any other is the
races of the individuals involved, I would say that you could use some
more experience with people of ALL races to rid you of this rediculous
notion that race can somehow predict behavior.

It may be self-agrandizing of me to say so but, I think chess players
are an intelligent, cultured bunch and not susceptible to this idiocy
(I mean regular chess players, not the top of the heap who know
nothing but; Bobby Fischer for example lol - whatta maroon).
