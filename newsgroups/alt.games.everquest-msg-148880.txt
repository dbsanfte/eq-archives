I've PL'ed a bunch of friends with my Paladin, and using a Paladin
as a Pl'er has a couple of nice advantages:

1.  At level 45+, free manaless healing with the DW helm.
It casts an AC/HP buff, and if you cast it repeatedly it
heals 120HP every 10 seconds.  Since it's manaless, this
can be kept up forever, nonstop, and if done continuously
is equivalent to wearing 5.5 Fungi tunics at once.

2.  If the person being PL'ed gets overwhelmed by
adds and dies, which seems to happen rather often, the
Paladin just rezzes him back and the PL'ing resumes
with very little downtime.
