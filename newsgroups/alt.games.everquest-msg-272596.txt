Where were you in Early PoP?  Warriors simply were the tank of last
choice those days due to their inability to get an on-demand agro lock.

And really, about the only 1 group gigs that required a War were the
1st sewer trial in GoD, Tipt, Vxed, and I can't speak for the Ikkinz
1 group trials.  Knights could tank adequately for xp events in GoD.
