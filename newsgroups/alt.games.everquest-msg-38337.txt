Sigs, not signs, as in signatures. See all the text below this? My
name, and four lines of quote (wonder if anyone knows where it comes
from)? That's a sig. When you edit out irrelevant text replying on
usenet, you're supposed to get rid of superflous text like sigs.
Especially when they are too long by usenet standards, like mine is
this week. :-p

Since you're not a clueless top posting idiot, I felt you were worth
saving.

Now the man around the corner swore he'd kill the cat on sight,
so he loaded up his shotgun with nails and dynamite!
He waited and he waited for the cat to come around;
Ninety-seven pieces of the man is all they ever found....
