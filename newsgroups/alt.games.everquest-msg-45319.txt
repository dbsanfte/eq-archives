Or:

You try to slash Firiona Vie, but miss!
You try to slash Firiona Vie, but miss!
You try to slash Firiona Vie, but miss!
You try to slash Firiona Vie, but miss!
You try to slash Firiona Vie, but miss!
You slash Firiona Vie for 1 point of damage.
Firiona Vie ripostes.
Firiona Vie slashes YOU for 18219 points of damage.
