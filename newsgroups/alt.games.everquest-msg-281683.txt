Hi!

I'm currently stuck and can't level up as an artisan becouse I can't find
the subclass quest I need to do to advance. I am already certified as a Sage
and have 103% towards next level so I know I'm missing something. I've been
running all over Freeport looking for places and talking to people but can't
seem to find whatever it is I need to do to be alloved to level up and
become a full sage.
Any advice and help would be greatly apreciated!

Best Wishes
Thomas
