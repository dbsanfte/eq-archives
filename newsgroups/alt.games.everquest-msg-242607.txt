Unlikely. Just adding one new class in an expansion is a balancing
nightmare. Adding one for each race....that would be a massive
undertaking.

The problem with making races unique beyond cosmetics is perceived
balance. "Class envy" is bad enough, that would be adding in "race
envy". I'm not saying it would cause a REAL problem, but it would
cause a lot people to believe there was a balance problem. :(
