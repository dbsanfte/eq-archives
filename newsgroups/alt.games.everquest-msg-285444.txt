What I have is a Hp Pavilion m7570n.  When I bought the computer I
mailed in the upc on the box it came in in order to get the rebate; and
since I didn't think I needed to consider anything beyond "agp" or "pci"
when I knew I would eventually have to upgrade the video card, I threw
out the box with all the computer specs on it.   I have been going
through the info thatt came with the computer and can't see anything in
there about what type of expansion slots it has (I know how dumb I sound
as I am typing this.)  Since my original post I have rechecked the info
on my computer model on the Best Buy and Circuit City sites and realized
that I may have made an error when I said I had no pci express slot.
Circuit City lists my model as having two pci slots available while Best
Buy lists my model as having one pci and one pci express slot available.
Upon checking through the Circuit City computers I saw no "pci express"
expansion slots listed on any computer.  So I am guessing they are
listing both the pci and pci express slots as "pci."  At least that is
what I am hoping.
I am planning on paying a store to install whatever card I get.  I
really, really, really, don't want to go digging around in there
:)))))))  Just reading about the different aspects of video cards is
intimidating me :)  I can only begin to imagine the amount of trouble I
can get myself into by messing around in there !
Can anybody offer a suggestion for a good video card for EQ2 and it's
expansions at a $100 to $150 range ?
I really appreciate the advice and information offered !  I did not
realize how ignorant I was on all this until I started typing it out,
lol.  Thank you for your help !
