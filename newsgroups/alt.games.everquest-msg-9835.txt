Sounds like you're in the same boat, then. Objection withdrawn. :-)

Eh, I suppose it's just a different playstyle. I prefer camping
out "whole", so to speak, but it only took a couple of weeknights
with corpse-run sleep-deprivation to make me realize that retrieving
my corpse isn't always a viable option.

In fact, if I've been dying a lot, I'll sometimes take a couple
of days to go do some quests or work on my tradeskills or
otherwise change modes for awhile. When I'm ready for
hack-n-slash again, my corpse is still there waiting for me and
I've had some time to reflect on how I can do better at whatever
it is I've been doing.

Now, if Verant institutes an increased rate of decay or a
corpse-eating monster or something then I'll give it a higher
priority. Until then, my corpse works as a fine "locker" for
the temporary storage of my equipment until I need it.
