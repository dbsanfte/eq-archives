If you've read through the most recent Producers Letter, you'll find that
they've apparently learned their lesson on this score. Only took em 2 years,
too.

Mostly agreed. Lesson for another game, i suppose.

I don't agree. I consider myself a casual gamer, I play 10 hours a week if
I'm lucky. Out of several characters I play regularly, my primary is level

I guess it just depends on where the player's priorities are.

A year ago, this was true. Painfully true.

With the two continents that have been added since last March, it's no
longer so.
