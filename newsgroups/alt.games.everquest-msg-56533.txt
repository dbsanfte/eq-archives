>learned EQ lesson #1, print some damn maps!
>
I started playing a magician over a year ago.  I remember getting lost in my
home town of qeynos (of all places), but eventually found my way around.
about a week or two later i was high enough level to wander around the
countryside and into underground zones (without any maps, i never ventured
too deep untill i had the entry areas memorized)... Then someone told me a
site to go to to get maps... went to check it out and printed out 5 areas...
as i was using the maps to get around areas it was then that i realized that
everquest would not be as fun to play if you know exactly where to go
everytime... part of the experience is exploring.  So i trashed the maps and
never went to that site again... nor did i go to any other site that gives
you walkthroughs for items and whatnot.  Play the game the way it was
intended and i guarantee the quests you do will be much more rewarding when
you finish them then knowing exactly what to kill or who to talk to and
where to go.
