There are 4 crafting areas in each village I think. One that everyone
uses for levels 1 - 10, then 3 others depending on what route you take.
If you are just an artisan, you may just need to try the other crafter
zone doormen until you find the one that will let you in.

Remember the more populated the society, the more people there are to
do crafter quests, so the more supplies and stuff the society has to
sell. On my server I have found that only two or three societies are
used, so joining one of the less crowded ones has the advantage of less
people around each station, but also means you have less materials to
work with.

It might also be worth considering moving any alts you have to the same
society too, that way any quests you do for the society benefit all
your characters.
