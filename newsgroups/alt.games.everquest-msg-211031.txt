I am posting this on behalf of my friend who showed me a strange graphics
bug. He is running Windows Me, and uses a Geforce 4200 Ti card. Things will
start out normally, but as time goes on and he zones etc. the world becomes
"washed out" eveything like buildings becomes stark white with no detail.
Also, some characters are butt naked, literally. While Quite amusing....this
is hardly the best environment to play in. The wash out bug is the most
common occurance, but I have seen him zone into Cobalt Scar, and the texture
of the land is a series of massive stripes and artificial patterns. I
upgraded his Nvidia drivers, so they are all current, but this did not solve
the problem. He was told by someone else that his card might be overheating
and thus causing the problems, but the card diagnostic does not show this
(it isn't overclocked either). So, If anyone has some good ideas or
suggestions, fire away.

Thanks
