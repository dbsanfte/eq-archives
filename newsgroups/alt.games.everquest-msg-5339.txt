My troll SK made the treacherous trip to the Lake last night.  I am bound in
Overthere.  Got in a good group and had some fun, but want some basic tips
for evil races in a foreign land:

Bound in OT, but my map says I can get bound in Frontier Mts.  Is this the
best place to bind for LOIO access?
What merchants can I trade with?
Is OT the nearest bank?
Any general hints or tips for this area especially w/regards to my
race/class?


        thanks
