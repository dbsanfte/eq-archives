Its enough to keep me far from the server. I like seeing the whole
game... with a dozen classes I'm not going to pick just one.

Its not about twinking... the whole game could be no-drop for all i
care, its about people.

Sure I could play across multiple servers, but then I'd have to deal
with multiple groups of friends.When I flip between characters I'd
prefer not to have to switch between friends too.

Maybe if EQ wasn't so rigidly classed I'd play on FV... but even then
probably not... if the character system is rich enough to go multiple
directions I'd want to see them... 

One char per server is not the only way to solve the reputation
problem... all you have to do is give each character a last name for
the whole account... so what if an iksar and an erudite are family,
its a concession I'd be willing to make.
