It's not just newbies that do that. I was asked to help track in FV with my
level 30 Ranger. I did. But I went LD.  Then my computer went dead for about
2 weeks.
When I came back I played another character for about 2 weeks ( have 2 level
30s on 2 different servers m- another story ). When I went back I found out
I was dead! Apparently got hit by something while LD. Lost all my nice Ivy
etched, Berserker sword, etc etc.
