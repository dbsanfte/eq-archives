Summoned pet-wise, yeah. But I challenge a mage or necro to charm solo
in as many zones as an enc can =P Sure, the charm XP penalty hurts, but if
you're smart and know the best pet in a zone (usually the major overcons,
such
as manticores in EW) you can solo for most of your life. And it's excellent
cash
once you start getting into zones like HoH, PoTa and BoT.
