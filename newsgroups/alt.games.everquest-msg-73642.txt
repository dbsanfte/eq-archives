I think if you have the system to run Luclin, I believe the textures improve
if you have luclin. I could easily be wrong and the textures were increased
for everyone across the board though.  Other than the new spells available /
new equipment / new hunting places, I cannot think of any other benefit.

Oh, there is also a teleporter to alot of other places from one central
spot, so if you have 512 meg ram, travel would be increased by having
luclin.
