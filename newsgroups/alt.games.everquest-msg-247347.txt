More on this in a second...

I think you're right but I also think the focus of the game changed so
significantly that the players no longer see any need for that kind of
commitment, since so much is handed to them without anywhere near that
much anyways.

Yeah. Though I don't necessarily agree with calling combat the only
thing as "uptime". That belief is quite frankly part of the problem
and is behind why so much emphasis is now on "grinding", like ldon.

Planetside is not a mmorpg. That is all the difference needed right
there.

Take Woodcock's numbers with a grain of salt the size of the capital
of Utah. 

1. Games don't always use the same method of having or counting
subscribers - this eliminates all the eastern games from fair
comparison. Some companies counted anyone who had ever subscribed as a
subscriber, active or not.

2. Active subscribers is one way of counting, actual people logging in
another, and the two don't always jive. A great number of people in EQ
are no longer really playing most the game, just logging in for raids
and logging out when done.

3. Bruce outright guesses with alarming frequency, which explains why
he has to keep going back and altering the older points on the graph
when more information becomes available. Sometimes its the company's
fault - one DAoC listing was wrong because Mythic either lied or
misrepresented its own subscriber numbers once (quickly removing the
number when it noticed). 

The chart is okay for general interest but shouldn't be considered
gospel.

But I agree, the timing of the beginning of "decline and death" just
in raw subscriber numbers probably does come at about one year ago.
But with many other factors at play, the graph can't really be judged
in such simple terms. Mmorpgs are, in the end, not bacteria. :-p
