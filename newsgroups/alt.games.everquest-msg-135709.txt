Gotcha.  We ended up getting a PCI video card (nVidia GeForce4), and oh, 
does it whistle along wonderfully now.  ::big ol' goofy grin::

I know the new video card will benefit me in tons of ways down the road, 
but it's *still* frustrating to be unable to play post-patch without a 
hardware upgrade.  :)
