love this idea, as it also allows you the ability to create guild / central
banks with alot less micromanagement.

Potential programming problem would be would the system know what that
person actually had in bank if they weren't logged on?

Definite exploits would be having people who you trusted to trade your bank
key to another char run off with it, instead of giving it to who you wanted.
Or have some end user you trusted with the key rob you blind.  ( already
happens with people trusting others with their passwords to their chars).

an add on feature to help protect the bank a little would be the ability to
change the locks.
