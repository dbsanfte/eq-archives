Sanity at last ;)

Edit your eqclient.ini

In the defaults section

ShowInspectMessage=FALSE

Peace at last.

Strangely I started this thread up, whilst I can understand people 
getting upset about the you are being inspected messages, for the life 
of me I can't understand people getting upset about us getting upset 
about the messages;)

It is a strange strange world
