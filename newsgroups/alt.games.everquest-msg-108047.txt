Well, at least they're trying.  They do seem to be utterly unable to
put in much of anything that allows characters to hunt/quest for gear
even equal in quality to the stuff you can buy on the player market
with funds easily available at levels 10 to 30.  There are exceptions,
but they're rare.  The one really nice thing about the ghoulbane quest
is that a L25 group can go out and quest for a weapon that is very
serviceable at that level, tho when not fighting undead a centi ss
is better and it can be bought for 300 to 500.
