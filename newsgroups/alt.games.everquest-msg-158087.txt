A Magetower mage just hit 65 as well.  He also has several
of his new pets, and some of the new summoned items.

Other pet classes are going to be seeking these out -
weapons with +50hp and a large, frequent, proc on
them (for the 61 air pet the procs are 140 dd).

The 61 summoned belt has 250hp on it, the 64
has *500* hp on it.

That means that, between focus items, 2 weapons and
the belt a 65 mage can add 760 hp permanently to his
pet.
