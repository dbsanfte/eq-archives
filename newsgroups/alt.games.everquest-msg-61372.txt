*Will* have relics some time in the future that
*May* swing the balance towards those who succeed.

which will definitely accelerate the movement of players towards
the realm that is doing best. The game will fail if it creates a
positive feedback cycle where winning makes further victories more
likely. At the same time it has to offer some advantage to make
players care.

It's going to be a very interesting juggling act for mythic, and
they're being very quiet on how that's going to work.
