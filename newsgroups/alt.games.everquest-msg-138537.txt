Some months ago, there was a raid on the Plane of Air (I think),
conducted by about 20-30 mages, 1 cleric, 1 enchanter, 1 monk, etc. I
think they would be intrigued to know this, given that it was a
very successful raid, and the pets were doing a lot of the work.

No, I don't have a cite for this. Search a mage-specific ezboard or
something. I think it was linked to here as well. Definitely happened,
screenshots were impressive. They stayed up in the plane for a week,
farming crowns for the mage epic.

Cheers,
Jock
