>>Personally, I'd love to see a Delta team sent to Afghanistan and capture
Bin Laudin and bring him back for trial and execution. The only sad thing is
there's probably hundreds more there ready to take his place.<<


First we have to know it was him. If you remember correctly, when the
Oklahoma City bomb first went off, we thought it was Bin Laudin. Turned out
to be someone nowhere related to his cause.

The tragedy just happened today. Let's not jump to conclusions, let's let
the FBI and CIA do their job and find the people responsible. Then we (the
Military) can go do our job.
