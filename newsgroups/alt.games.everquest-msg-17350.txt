I've been looking for him for about 2 weeks now and haven't seen hide nor
hair of him, even when I bring higher level Rangers and Druids from my guild
to track for me (just in case I'm being a blind idiot).

I hope that Verant hasn't screwed up this quest, because we monks need this
at some point in time to complete our epic (we start ours at level 1, LOL).

If ya'll get any additional info on this, I would love to know about it, and
additional posts on this topic would be appreciated.
