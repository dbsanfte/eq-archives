Not only a top poster, but spoken like sombody who's never even seen a
manaburn team.

You try it with just the four wizzies alone, and none of them crits
(which can happen often), they had all damned well better have damn near
top end +mana gear, and get off a burn for damned near max damage. Lot's
of burns only fall in the 6 or 7K HP range.  If you get four hits for
average 7K on Gore and you're going to have four OOM wizards looking at
a suddenly VERY angry, highly singed, but still extremely dangerous
dragon. And you without even the mana for a gate.

Oooops.

"Im sorry, Ms. Gorenaire..... really very, very, very sorry. This was a
terrible misunderstanding. You'll laugh when you hear, actually. he he
he... ummm...  You see, my friends and I were aiming at that Yeti over
there and.... ummm... what's that? Oh, I see. Yes, well... I suppose I
can understand that."

AAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH

(wisps of smoke rise from the four bodies.)

Bring a fifth wiz to be safe, or at least a lifeburn necro or something.
And after you go KOS on two kills, you'll need to bring a puller,
attention getter anyhow.

(Not gotten to do it myself yet, mind you, but I get to watch in wizard
chat while others do. Great fun! And for some, the only way to get a
copy of sunstrike without paying 75K PP for it.)
