Greetings.

Traveling through The Overthere the other day I noticed a new NPC. Translocater
Soandso, standing on the docks. While I'm koS in OT, I couldn't stop and chat with
this green-robed visitor but I'd like to know if anyone else has learned of their
purpose. Being named a Translocater, do they trans you to your bind point? Intriguing
name. Also, when using the pots in Tim Deep, I noticed a skeleton there called a lost
traveler or something, both conned green and indifferent. Something is afoot in
Norrath.

Zuit.
