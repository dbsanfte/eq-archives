I've noticed this as well.  Soloing in LOIO, up comes a Sarnak, Root,
Creeping Crud, Flame Lick, Immolate, and a combust for good measure.  Then I
sit to med while the Root-Rot takes effect.  Well, the Mob's HP do NOT move
at all, and I'm thinking "Gee, this was a waste..."  Finally, root breaks,
and the mob starts creeping towards me...I get ready to meelee , and the mob
hits me once, gets his finger caught on my Bramble Coat, his health drops
from like 98% to 1%, I slap him, and he dies.

So...either the HP update is not working correctly...or...Bramble Coat is
one MEAN DS... (c;
