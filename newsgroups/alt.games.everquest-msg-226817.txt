I dont think druids have it all that bad. You can get decent xp by charming
stuff in the planes (solo), and selling ports really isnt where the money is
at. Druid with horse and a couple of mana regen spells is decent dps at high
levels.

Try necro if you think druids have it tough now. (mutters about the pathing
changes)
