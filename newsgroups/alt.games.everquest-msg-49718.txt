Karana is fairly populated 24 / 7, compared to a lot of the servers.  It has
an incredibly large French population so there are only a few hours when the
server has a low population.

I personally don't believe where it is in the server list.  Ever since they
got scared of the competition and hid the server numbers, Karana is showing
as one of the most populated servers, and usually THE most popluated server,
whenever I play.  It used to be in the tops half, but was never at the
bottom most of the time.

If you speak french, I highly recommend Karana.  If not, I would go
elsewhere.  Low populations are a GoodThing(tm).  If you are having problems
finding a group, go to one of the more common group zones for your level.  I
would think being on a server where the population is low at the time you
play would be great if you like to solo, so you can have the best of both
worlds.  Finding a pick-up group in Sol A may be a little hard, though, so
go to the Nasty Lake instead.  When you have a regular group, then you can
hit the out of the way dungeons where you can't find a pick-up group.
