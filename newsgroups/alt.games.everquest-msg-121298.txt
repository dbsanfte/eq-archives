*shrug*
What you think the port is worth is irrelevant. The only thing that
matters is what the porter thinks it is worth. And if you are only
willing to pay 2 pp for a port, you'd damned well better be up front
about only offering that and not just say a vague 'will donate' (which
is usually expected to be at least 10-15).

Personally, I think that 5-10 minutes of my playing time and 370-450
mana is worth more than 2 pp, even though most of my ports are free. 
I just refuse to port arrogant, jealous, ignorant cretins like you.
