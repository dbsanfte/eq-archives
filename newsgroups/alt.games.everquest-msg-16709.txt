Innoruuk clerics have some quest items they can get, the disciple symbol
of Innoruuk, initiate symbol of innoruuk, etc, where you turn in your
previous symbol and some other stuff to get the next in the series. The
best of these, the Regent symbol, has a right click effect with
unlimited charges of clinging darkness, the necro snare/DoT spell, as
well as +7 AC, +3 Wis, +2 Int, +15 Mana.
