And you think that Drizzt, Elric, Frodo, Tanis are just the "hero" of one
person?
Great We have 150 dark elves with the Drizzt or a misspelling of, fantastic
idea.
A desire to be like ones "hero" sounds more like a lack of imagination to
me, cannot create your own character so you borrow one from literature.
If you want to be Drizzt, make a Dark Elf warrior, call him what you like
and then go out of your way to earn faction with the good races. there you
go, you are playing your hero but with your own name. How would you feel if
you got the name Drizzt past...you'd made your Dark Elf Warrior (no rangers,
oh well, nm) and get the surname Do'Urden (Do'Urden, Baggins, Halfelven or
Whitewolf would not be barred) then you group up with another Dark Elf
warrior called Drrizzt Do'Urden and later you go on a raid and not only is
Drrizzt there but also Drizztt Do'Urden as well...does this help you in your
quest to be like your hero, knowing that there are others doing the same?
Hey you could get together and start a guild, how about calling yourselves
"Salvatore's Infuence"

Can't be a Dark Elf Ranger (thank god)
Would I want to play the character from any books? No...but then I prefer to
create a reputation and story for myself (not necassarily a good rep, but
it's mine)
rather than take the name from some popular novel and expect people to see
me as that character.

Calling yourself Matronmalice or Matron Malice would have been against the
rules as it gives you a title you have not earned.

And so you have used some imagination, I'd say Malice was already taken as a
name and NOT barred due to it's involvement in Salvatore novels in the same
way as Zaknafein was not (it may be now, not sure...there was a Zaknafein
Do'Urdon on BB and have since seen a couple of misspellings)

It is showing a lack of individuality imo but I'd have no problem seeing the
surname Do'urden...as long as the first name was not a misspelling of
Drizzt.
It is childish, really? I can live with that.

I doubt Salvatore is that lacking in the imagination department to have to
name his EQ character(s) after characters from any of his books.

More likely just sick of seeing people playing that can't think of a name
for themselves. I am not one for petitioning names although I will still
petition names that are blatantly offensive. Come to me with a name such as
Donewentmad, EQmule, Jolygrengiant and numerous others not to mention the
amount of Aragorn and Gandalf misspellings and you'll not get the time of
day, let alone a SoW, Port, Heal, buff or that Air elemental pulled off your
tail...if my ignore list would allow it I'd just stick all these names on
ignore but alas, I only have a 30 name list and I could fill that in a hour
in EC.

Sounds like a small sweet that you used to get in France. You are seem to be
offended. Is this because you see this as a criticism on your self and your
own character name?

>
>       Lars aka. Maliciosa Do'Urden

Although I'd prolly roll my eyes at seeing your surname, it is not against
the naming policy and neither would I see it as such (and you'd still get
Sow's and ports from me with that name)
The argument for these names is always, it's childish and anal for anyone to
care...the argument against..erm..read the rules sometime.
