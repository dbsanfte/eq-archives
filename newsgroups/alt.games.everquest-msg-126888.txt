Get a few friends together and go dungeon crawling.

35-40 is good in Dalnir, towards the end you can move to Kaesora, which will
get you to 45 fast, then to City of Mist, which is good all the way to 55,
and exp up to 60 in places.

Other options are Echo Caverns, bogling area is good up to 38 or so I think
(don't try the big shroom though), the underbulk area and the skeletons near
the Taskmaster spawn are good up to late 40s.  Crystal Caverns will get you
up to 45 or so fast, just have to move hunting areas after a few levels ( 37
on orcs, 42 on spiders/spikes, 45 on geos).  Kedge keep entry hall is VERY
good up to 44, the exp mod in Kedge owns, but you need an EB item or caster.
