This won't work, unsnared mobs run too fast for a nuke to hit
before they run out of range.

Fear kiting means fearing a mob and then running after it to
kill it... also known as reverse kiting, since its you chasing the kite.

If you have SOW you can attempt to fear kite unsnared mobs,
but whether you use melee or nukes, its going to be difficult.

Fortunately, noone said kiting had to be a solitary pursuit.  Get
a ranger, druid, shadowknight, or necro buddy (sorry, bard
snare is too unreliable) and split the job; they snare, you fear,
and you both do the damage.  Add a rogue as third to really
do it right.
