I think they already nerfed druid soloing by making most new mobs immune to
changes in their running speed. I think they've worked on it for ages by
doing things like making wolfform kos to everything bar the original guards
of some of the old world places.

One of the side effects is that some zones have huge camps that are left
untouched (eg grimling forest) because dealing with the adds is too painful
unless you are grouped with an enchanter. Is grimling forest ever busy on
any server? So many camps sitting around doing nothing; what a waste.

Only time i see a crowd is when high levels are going to acrylia caverns or
otherwise passing through.
