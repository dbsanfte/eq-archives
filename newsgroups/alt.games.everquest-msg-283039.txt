Found out that the MT was only ever mez'd for a sec since the mobs
would break it on attack.  They kept attacking, thought they stopped
but apparently not.

So I guess with a shaman and a necro in the group we should be able to
keep dot's up, but question on that:
is the only way to dot another PC is with 'duel'?  And if so, can we
leave duel up for the length of the encounter?

Thanks.
