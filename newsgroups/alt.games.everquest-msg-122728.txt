Quoted from the top of the EQTraders Baking recipe page...

"Unless otherwise noted, all baked goods have a weight of 0.1"

And a stack always weighs the same, no matter how many items are in it (20
fish rolls weighs 0.1)

East Freeport sells Fresh Fish (Port Authority building)
West Freeport sells Jugs of Sauce (Brownloe Bakery) and Batwings (Wizzie
Guild, spell component vendors)

1 Fresh Fish + 1 Jug of Sauce = 2 Fish Fillets (trivial at 82, sells back
for a couple of silver more than it costs)
1 Fresh Fish + 1 Batwing = 1 Fish Roll (trivial at 135, Banquet size meal)

After 135, there are only a few more milestones...

142 - various pies (you can use foraged Basilisk or Griffin eggs to make
dough) including meat (plain 'chunk of') and Fruit (foraged)

162 - Wedding Cake (complex and involves a few preparation steps)

188 - Luclin recipes (using Mindworm or Centi meat)

202 - Marr Cherries (looted Pixie dsut + foraged Cinnamon Sticks)

... and after that, you're looking at Dragon meat or camping new Cazic for
Tae Ew meat.
