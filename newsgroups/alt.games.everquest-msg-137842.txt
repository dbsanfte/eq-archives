I keep asking for a substantive argument from you, don't tap-dance
around the issue.  The are currently *4* areas in which I am awaiting
this evidence of yours, and you have failed to respond!

Oh, so you polled "everyone" else, did you?  And you are so special
that you know for a fact what would or would not be obvious to me?
Nice mind-reading skills you have there, EQ!   Can you read my mind
right now, EQ?

You might considering the purschase of a dictionary.  "Proof" is one
of those words you so frequently missuse.

> Oh jeeeeze, please pick up your dates in other groups, ya mind??

Which other groups would that be, EQ?  Do you own any of the  groups
this is cross-posted to, EQ?  Get off your soapbox, EQ!   Step out of
your glass house, EQ!  YOU are the last person to have any right to
start bitching about what someone else posts to Usenet, EQ!    LOL

Tell you what.  If you show any logic or rational argument, then you
might get to see how I like it.  Since you have yet to show either
logic or a rational argument, how can you know if I like either?
You seem to like avoiding difficult questions, like the 4 topics you
are unable to provide substantive answers to.


> There is no harm or dishonor in being ignorant, BS...

And this explains why you aren't embarassed to show yourself in
public, but what does it have to do with this conversation?  Are you
trying to say that you are not ashamed of being unable to answer the
four issues you have abandoned?

I'm not afraid to educate myself on an issue before making an opinion.
I'm not afraid to admit that some people are experts in the field, and
just maybe they know somehting I don't.  I'm not afraid to pick up the
phone and call someone, read published works, and search the net for
academic works.   I'm not afraid to read views that support or
contradict my opinions on the matter.  I'm also not a complete moron
who thinks everything has a simple black/white answer (for example, if
you read Library of Parliament publication BP194e 1997 rev. you will
see seemingly contradictory statements made about Section 33 of the
Charter, based on different interpretation of what constitutes a
"maximum" and a "renewal").

What are you so afraid of, EQ?

> Funny how if we strip out all the personal attacks of your posts,
> nothing would remain...

So, you must have considered all the following to be "personal
attacks", since you never bothered even an attempt at a rebuttal.   So
far you have run away from these issues:

1) You can no longer justify your stupid claim that "open
homosexuality hasn't been an issue until the last 20 years or so" and
therefore dropped the topic like a hot potato.

2) You made a statement that the first article you linked to somehow
proved that some imaginary "homosexual lifestyle" was being forced on
"everyone".  I made nine statements to the contrary, you had no
rebuttal for any of them.  You then jettisoned that angle to link to a
second news article.

3) You ignored my challenge to prove your statement that I was forcing
my so-called homosexual lifestyle on anyone.   YOUR words: " All
anyone has seen is your militant attitude about forcing your lifestyle
on everyone else... "

4) You are failing to provide this policy you say Big Brothers-Big
Sisters of America Inc. has.  If such a policy exists, it should be
easy for you to provide the exact text and/or a link.   Then you need
to show how the existence of such would somehow invalidate what you
imagine my position to be.
