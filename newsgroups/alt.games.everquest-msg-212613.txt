That'd be a different bible study than any I've ever
encountered, then.   Bible study is about studying
the bible, not investigating quantum physics...

How exactly is that different than the scientist who uses a
theory to explain things?   "We have a good idea that
this is how things are, or why they happened.  We don't
have a shred of proof, but we do have a theory..."  They
don't challenge the *fundamental* underlying "truth", just
the accuracy of their theory.  They don't change from
their faith-based beliefs either.   About the only difference
between the two is "God is unknowable" vs "Science doesn't
know."

Again, how's that different than anyone else?  Isn't that the
equal  of "we don't know, therefore we must wait to find more
facts and, if necessary, change our faith-in-science-based
theory to another faith-in-science-based theory?"
