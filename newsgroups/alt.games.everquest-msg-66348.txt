  I don't need to call Microsoft or Verant to get a component of Windows 95
to work, because it still functions just as well as it did the day I bought
it.  Better, in fact.  No patches or updates from Microsoft have crippled
the software.  No new patches or updates are available for Windows 95
anymore, but I can still use every component of Windows 95 that it came
with, and then some.  The same is not true of EverQuest.

  Again, the only thing that bothers me about this is that they rushed it.
Microsoft gave us warning that they would no longer be supporting Windows
95, Verant didn't.  Verant can't even get their software to work properly
for people whom they do claim to support.  If they hadn't rushed, we Windows
95 folks would have been given a bit of warning that an upgrade would be
necessary and would not have had our service essentially abruptly
terminated, and those people who are and were experiencing serious issues
despite having a system that meets the "surprise" system requirements,
probably would be enjoying a properly functioning game right now with maybe
a few minor bugs, instead of game crashing, game ruining issues.
