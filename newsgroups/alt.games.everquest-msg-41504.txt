What makes it doubly sad, is that the Communist regime was the only
brief period of civilization Afghanistan has known in the last thousand
years. Kabul was, not a Western city by a long stretch, but at least a
place where women could walk around with their faces uncovered, and go
to college... And the Americans didn't show a lot of support or sympathy
when Chechen terrorists blew up several apartment blocks throughout
Russia a few years ago and the Russian government responded in a manner
no more swift or harsh than what it's being called for in this NG.

At least, now there will be a realization that *this* is the struggle of
the 21th Century, much as the fight against tyranny was the struggle of
the 20th, and that we are all together in this, regardless of politics.
Terrorism cannot be used as a political tool, even if you believe you
are on the side of the angels. The position that `If they are yours they
are "Terrorists", if they are ours they are "Freedom Fighters"` must
end, forever.
