There should be a sticker on the jewel case. Im betting you dont have
the original jewel case and stuck the disk in a plain case a while
back (done this myself on a few occasions - damn me). How long ago did
you last play? If more than 6 months then your original account was
probably deleted (i seem to recall 6 months being the "shelf" life of
an account). If so - im not sure what you can do without the account
codes. You may have to bite the bullet and buy a new disk.
