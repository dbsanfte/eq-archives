Most people aren't past the teens yet.  Mages can
tank for groups and even then healers *still* have
plenty of power to nuke.   *shrug*   I'm hoping it will
change as people level-up.

Not AFAIK.

That's really not a factor in a group which knows what it's
doing.  The first step is to get the mobs under control in
some fashion - rooted, mezzed, all beating on the tank,
whatever.  Then the fight really does slow down and you
don't lose much damage -- everyone should be waiting
for the tank to gain sufficient aggro anyway.   Then he
or the scout initiates a chain and everyone follows.  If
everyone is keeping alert and knows what to do, it's a
fairly quick progession.   Then people do what they
need to do for a moment and another chain is started.

Yes, so any two of a class in a group need to coordinate
their actions.   One takes HO advancement as their task,
the other(s) in their class do the other roles during the
non-HO segment(s).

It's just teamwork.  The biggest thing seems to get people
to back-off the 'nuke, nuke, nuke' (even if their nuke is a
special attack) and try to approach the encounter in an
organized fashion.   But, as said, this is really the "Oasis"
and "LoIO" stage...
