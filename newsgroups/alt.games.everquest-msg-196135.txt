Or at any rate it gives a chance.  I have had /assist take so long
to resolve that I actually hit a mob three times after using /assist
before the player that the mob had been agro'd on appeared in my target
box (was using /assist to avoid KSing, obviously not a guaranteed
solution).  Which shows that, at least at that time (last fall I think
is when it happened), the client, the server, or both working together,
placed a higher priority on resolving melee attacks than on targetting
those same attacks.  I'm thinking they must've at least partially fixed
this behavior, as I haven't seen delays longer than about a half second
in changing target via /assist since then (three hits would've taken
over 2 seconds:  34 delay 2-hander and 46% total haste, no riposte on
first hit as I was directly behind the mob).
