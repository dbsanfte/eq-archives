Thanks all, got some good feedback.  Off to explore some more and see
what I can find.  Many of the suggestions provided I've already tried,
but some I haven't.  I'll see what I can turn up.

Another thought though.  Any decent 30ish level quests that could net
some decent xp in addition to the slow leveling of the occassional
blue con?  I've checked Allakhazam's but have found that many of the
quests they list for 30ish are meant from a group of 30's.  Anyone
know maybe a quest or two that I could do a few times for some decent
xp?  Zone danger level isn't a factor, I've learned to travel places I
should truly be.
