Sorry bud , but thats not a future. Just more Time. Anything they do
to the game from now on is just going to be eye candy, game play can
no longer evolve  in EQ unless it is rewittten.

No it's not, not for a online community, right now EQ is in decline
with it peaking when Luclin was released. SO in reality the community
fail in 3 years and began to died. A game like SWG should last
indefinitly concidering that someone can become a mayor of their own
town and such. That takes time and a 'GOOD' in game economy, which EQ
never had.

You are at least one of the sane EQ players , I have asked people in
game'So ,what are you going to do when EQ ends". And I can almost see
their faces when the reply back" You mean  EQ ends?? I don't know."
God help these people, they will have to go get real friends or at
least a new computer LOL.

OK so how is getting the Macheads playing old EQ a game
improvement,once agian this is just another little life boost to keep
the game going, If they wanted everyone to play they would of had a
mac version 2 years ago, OK and get ready for the bonehead questions
in game too
 " EM Shouts/How do i take a screenshot of my warrior?"
You OOC/ Just hit your minus key"
EM/ I have a MAC, is it the same?"

>So quit bitching and keep playing!  ;-)
