I'm guessing DAoC fanboy looking to stir up a little more player
aggitatoin as the new game nears the end of beta. Not a very well
constructed troll though, unless the article can be validated, in which
case Flock should never have gotten a job at that level. Though I just
can't picture it.
  Companies are in business to make money. You don't have executives at
that level making those kinds of comments to the media and still stay
profitable and keep your job. Not in the real world. Not saying they
couldn't *feel* that way. :-)  But they'd come up with some sugar
coating and different phrasing.
