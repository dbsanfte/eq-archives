No matter what else, I really like your style.

No, actually, my point is that evil is subjective. The burning house
was intended to be a means of demonstrating that, but flared out of
control.

A robust response. I salute you.

An excellent series of specific examples clearly demonstrating that
simple self-preservation isn't the only thing driving human behavior. 

I see no reasonable, or clever, argument against what you're saying.
But then, I have no reason to argue against it - it doesn't appear to
contradict my position of evil being subjective.

In fact, what this particular sub-thread has to do that point has long
since escaped me. I'm still having fun though.

No, it usually takes several minutes for that to become clear.

Both. I'm enjoying the debate a great deal, even with your penetrating
and difficult questions. But I also firmly hold that good and evil are
completely subjective concepts.

>You really sincerely believe Stalin did no evil?

Have I said anything remotely like that during this entire debate?

I think he was evil as all hell. I think the Al Qeada should be
hammered into a bloody stain on the ground. I thought the Taliban
should have been horse-whipped way back when they started blowing up
ancient Buddha statues. I think someone should have smothered Hitler
in his crib. 

But that's not the point.
