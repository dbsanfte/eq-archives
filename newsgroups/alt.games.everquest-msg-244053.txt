   IMO, the faithstone is much less useful on FV than on regular servers,
but it can still be useful still.  I changed my bind spot from the PoK to
the NRo wayfarer camp.  I do like doing LDoN's and it is nice being able to
just gate to a camp (I was bound in BB till those annoying skellys drove me
out).  If I need to go to the PoK, I just faithstone home and run for the
book.

   The one for Felwithe sells for between 800p and up.  Dunno what the one
for dwarves goes for.
