Then you worded your objection wrong.  Saying it's wrong to expect NBG in a
RPG is incorrect (if that is what you meant?)  Since NBG would be used
exclusively in a real RPG, IMO.

The statement that NBG would not work in Everquest since EQ is a failure as
a RPG is a bit different, and much more supportable.
