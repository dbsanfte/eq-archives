Hm. Sorry, I'm afraid we've reached an imp's arse, in the words of Terry 
Pratchett. I just disagree with your basic premise, and we'll have to leave

I hated the fact that it couldn't bring itself to take sides, for science

Hm. Okey, lucky you. Unfortunately, I don't believe in 'right' or 'wrong', 
but in 'better than' and 'worse than', so your universe of blissful 
righteousness is closed to me.
