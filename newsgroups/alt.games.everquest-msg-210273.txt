These places are generally summer camp for rich kids. Really depends on
the camp director. I've worked for one run by a private boys school in
Australia and it was both.

The first year the director knew what it was all about, so when my group
of 10 x 16 year olds were 3 hours late (for a 2.5 hr walk) for a river
crossing on the first day of a 5day walk, my explanations of "they are
navigating" was just greeted by "novel". The other "rock jock/maco
instructors perferred to lead and took it personally if their group
wasn't first.

The second year, the director was a completed idiot (but ex-outward
bound camp director) and it was a total schmozzle. 
Years later, I met two kids from the first year at a tertiary
institution. The first said that the report I wrote was useless as a job
reference. I remember phrases like "would not work in a iron lung" and
"could not evaluate as boy made absolutely no effort". I found out he
had been thrown out of a Swiss Wilderness School for sneaking off to a
motel instead of doing a three day walk.

The second kid said he thought I was a real bastard at the camp ("what,
I have to run a lap of the cross country because I lost my issued
camping fork" - no daddy will pay for it from me.), but now he
understood what it was about and he had found it real useful. 

A third director I think had to have the police rescue one group one
year (nope not that school that always gets lost each year in the Blue
Mountains). Geez, most of the trips were road/track bashing anyway and
you would have to walk some seriously tight cirles to stay lost in the
bush in that area. I think that one went back to measuring penguins or
something. NFI about what it was all about - ever had an interview where
you realise afterwards they have NFI how to do the job and  you have
just told them how to do the job, but you don't get the job? 


Anyway, EQ is similar really, so many "rich kids" (plat rich) that can
not play their chr without buffs and uber weapons.
