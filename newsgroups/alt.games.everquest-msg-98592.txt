Sure isn't any 'impact' on the amount of enjoyment that I have going to
be in my head ? Or is there some external scale of enjoyment that I know
nothing about ?

Probably not, however there are somethings that VI could reasure us of
that would stop me (perhaps only me) from worrying.

If they said (for example) that it will still take the same number of
equivilently conning mobs to go from 11 - 60 then I would be quite
content.

Well that is true, I do have a life and don't PL.
But I want to pass the same (or at least an equivilent) test that the
first players passed (so that they could PL their alts)

I know there are, but I'm not using them. 
This is a personal challange for me.
I can control the way that I hunt / play the game, but I can't control
it if VI suddenly reduce the number of kills required by half.
Having some level 60 baby sit and power level me would reduce the
chalange of the game to me, so I don't do it. I can control that. 
If VI change the rules and make it much easier I can't control that.
Thus it would piss me off.

In some ways I am pissed off if I can't finish a game "well".
I'm not bothered about being the best ever (fastest, most points
whatever), but if I can't complete the chalanges I set my self then I
find it dissapointing. And it would annoy me if the reason that I can't
complete the chalanges that I have set my self is that VI have so
significantly change the game that my chalanges become trivial (in my
eyes).

I can also understand the feeling of those who got to 60 or got their
epic through the "hard times" being pissed off that others will now (or
may soon) be able to do the same with much less effort.

No I don't constantly grind. I experiment a lot and see new places.
Hell I have spent a lot of time in the warrens and stonebrunt, how many
can say that <G>
However I like hearing that Ding! and I like to think that some day I
will get to 40 or 45 or whatever. If I get to these levels it will make
me happy. Just as it made me happy to hit 32 last weekend.

> For me the journey is the adventure not the destination.

I agree totally, but I tend to journey to destinations rather than
wandering aimlessly. I set my self little chalanges, like get pottery to
118 or get to level 33 before my birthday or try to complete some quest
or another. Some of these are long term goals some short. If VI suddenly
put an express lane straight through the middle of norath then it is
going to make all those enjoyable journeys a whole lot shorter.

At the moment I worried about getting to 33, and getting my wisdom over
150.
By the time I'm worrying about what after 60 I expect there to be a lot
to do after 60. (Probably 2 or 3 more expansions)

Ok so my argments about grief player were not that well thought out.
I was trying to be the devils advocate and look for the worst case.

I agree with you, but we could not have a debate like that let alone a
usernet debate :-P
