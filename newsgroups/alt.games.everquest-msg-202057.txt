I picked this up today off one of the named's in Nadox,
a 7wis neck piece for druids with R-Click Savage Spirit
(their pet buff).  Any clues what I should be asking
for it?  None for sale in the Bazaar, and even then, that
probably wouldn't be a great way to figure it - prices
there are all over the map.

I think I undercharged for the Twice Stitched Sandals
I picked up there (just soloing some LB and DB stuff
past the temple to check it out - apparently some ok
stuff can drop randomly of the trash mobs).
