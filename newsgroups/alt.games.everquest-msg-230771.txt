Hi Again;

Thanks for the insight into my video problem. It seems by these responses
that I need to investigate just how "current" my drivers are and that my
card should be powerful enough. I'm currently using 52.16 version Nvidia Det
drivers.  I seem to be the only one with video lag from the new spell
effects. I seem to be backwards from everyone. I was just fine handling the
old spell effects and laggy on the new. I like to play "Battle Cleric" in
LDoN, since sitting is almost impossible at times. I have new admiration for
meleer's, when I'm in there mixing it up with them, I can't see anything and
at times just turn on "assist MT" and attack and watch my messages to see if
I'm near enough to hit anything.  When I do this the lag is awful. I use
F-keys for targeting and hot keys for casting so at least I can keep people
healed, but if I have to point with my mouse, I have to turn away from a
fight to do it.

Thanks for the "heads up" on drivers.  If there is anything else you can
think of, short of turning off spell effects, I would appreciate hearing
about it. I did go in and change my aperture from 64meg to 128 meg but no
noticeable difference.

Take Care All and again, Thanks for your feedback.
