Or in all likelihood just wait one day. then go to portal.
Wuoshi has a 10 min life span.

My first port to WL when I just got spell was one rare moment when Wuoshi
was alive
My naked explore ready to run thru the forest never even got to see the
landing.
I ported. I saw Loading.....
Went to bed.
Next day ooced in GD if wuoshi was up.Ported. got rezzed. ( always carry
grubs in ammo )
Don't ask why I never ooced on the first port...
