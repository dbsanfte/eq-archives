A few times, primarily in AC and AO, the generosity of other players actually 
ruined the game for me. I didn't know how to refuse their gifts without 
hurting their feelings, and I was left with little desire to continue. I just 
walked into the world an hour ago, and BAM ! I got 2 mill in my bank 
account.

The challenge and satisfaction from actually _earning_ my way in the game
was taken away.

Subsequently I learned how to refuse gracefully and let them help me in 
a non-stuff way. " If you could just safely get me to X city, I'd be eternally 
grateful " type thing. [ even if I didn't want to go ].
