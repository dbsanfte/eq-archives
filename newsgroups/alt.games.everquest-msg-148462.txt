Uhh, no it's not.  It's his mana and his time.  The only person that
can say what his time is worth is the OP.

Personally, I won't do a Luclin port with my druid for less than
100pp.  600 mana is more time than I wanna spend medding up after
playing taxi.

Not the enchanters problem.  If he didn't like the price he was
getting from the chanter, he was free to look somewhere else.

I'd also like to point out that the OP was not soliciting this guy,
but that he sought out the chanter in question.
