I am having problem running the latest EQ Patch.  After patch dialog box
finishes and when I hit play button, I get a message saying Fail to load
EQGfx_Dx8.dll.  EQ fail to run.  I looked for EQGfx_Dx8.dll and found it in EQ
directory.  Is this file corrupt?  Where can I get a copy of EQGfx_Dx8.dll?

My system consists of Voodoo3 graphics card, Win95b OS, and DirectX 8.0a is
loaded.  This configuration seems to work ok with other games.
