Unfortunately I think one of the reason for this is that
people got tired of busybodys butting into their auction
with shouts of that's over priced for item x, I usually see
it for Ypp.  So people stopped putting prices in, now nobody
knows what stuff sells for.  The prices guides are horribly
out of date and people try to "fix" prices by reporting way
high, or way low prices.  And with new stuff coming out of
Velious daily, the old stuff prices are fluctuating quite
abit.  But it is annoying when they don't know how much they
want for stuff.

I also have noticed the increase in the use of shout to
auction crap.  /ignore works well after a few shouts to
please use auction.  Some are new to the game, and don't
realize or don't bother to learn /auction.  I actually had
one person thank me, for some reason they had their default
speech type set to shout, and hadn't changed it, so....  Why
shout I don't know, I mean i can understand maybe /ooc.  We
used that when we went on a multiple group multiple guild
raid in kaesora, so that we all knew what was incoming etc.
