What did you say to him to elicit his response of " I'm sorry " ?
I'll bet it was rude and un-called for. In addition your response of
" don't do it again " was rude, crude and unattractive. No class.
Losing ALL that experience from killing a snake at level 3 was
really going to kill ya, wasn't it.

No it doesn't. Accidents happen. In order to be rude the intent has to
be there. The only person demonstrating intent to be a jerk was you.

The idiot in this case was you. You should be ashamed of yourself.
