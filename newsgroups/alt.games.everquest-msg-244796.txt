Or 31337.. k-rad... etc. Was just a lingo that built up ala jive,
funky handshakes, or whatever to seperate yourselves from the
uninformed. Didn't necessarily have to be underground.. i saw it a lot
on public boards.

I would say started on public BBS's and they've been poluting the net
since around '95 when most users immigrated to net usage

*raises hand and represents*! I was using public BBS's.. and some
not.. back in '93. In a lot of ways a public 14-line board running out
of someone's house was a lot more intimate then what the internet was
become due to the fact everyone was usually in your BBS's calling
radius due to long distance charges. As such, you usually got to meet
up every month or so at a public restaurant. What was really funny is
you'd have the same flame wars that go on the boards now in public
chat.. with cliques and what not and one group claiming guy X was
gonna beat the tar out of guy Y at the next meet. You'd get there and
they wouldn't do shit.

Its kind of sad they're pretty much gone now. For a span a 10-15 years
there wasn't anything like them or since.
