IANAL, but here is my understanding:

You are violating copyright if you use someone's intellectual property
without permission. This includes recognizable characters and
settings. Your story about Angel and Spike finally giving in to their
love for each other has copyright, but it can't be enforced because to
do so would be to acknowledge your own violation. The same holds true
for your riveting tale of the froglok triplets Bud Weis and Err and
their adventures in Karnor's Castle.
