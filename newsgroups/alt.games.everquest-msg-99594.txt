The opposite for me, but it's probably my fault... I transgreded against 
the First Law of Windows (if it ain't broke, don't dick with it), and 
upgraded my video drivers. I broke everything in differently horrible 
ways... I finally managed to get things back to acceptability by 
downloading the very latest drivers from Nvidia (they came out the day 
after I started messing with things), and now I get tolerable framerates 
again, but only for one hour or so.
