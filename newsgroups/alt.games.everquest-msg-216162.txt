No, I think what he's saying is, if at 100%, you pull a reasonable pull, 
everyone will go down to about 80 and med enough during the fight to be 
back at 100 before it's done so you can pull the next one.  If at 20% you 
pull the same reasonable pull, everyone will go down to roughly 0, scream 
oom a few times, and the wandering add will wipe you.  Or, if you're 
lucky, they'll med enough to be back up at 20 so you can roll those dice 
again.

}Wait...  what you mean is that the puller should assume he's grouped with

}evolution.  :)

Yes.  Always assume there is at least one mistake going to happen per 
pull.  Evolution would apply if only the person who made the mistake died, 
and it didn't wipe the rest of the party (except, possibly, the FD 
classes, rogues with escape, and bards with that cool FD song), and cost 
the entire team time and possibly the adventure.  If you allow for that 
one trivial mistake, you're ahead when it doesn't happen, instead of 
WAAAAY behind when it does.

}> Pacify is a single target spell
}Bzzt, strike one.  More than one version of the spell.

True.  There's the wake of tranquility version, which has a lower level 
cap, so it was ineffective on many mobs on the adventure in which the 
cleric tried it.  The mobs were also not always conveniently clumped, and 
WoT has a much longer refresh time.  WoT has its moments, but Pacification 
was infinitely preferable, other than its really ugly mana usage and the 
tendency of stupid people to bump into pacified mobs we were walking by.

The really joyous part of that adventure, though, was the tank, while 
beating on the mob, saying 'mem blur this so we can get to the boss!'

Never mind that I'd just spent the last half of my mana bar pac'ing us 
past the mobs someone just pulled...

}> and pulling using it requires that either your
}> cleric or chanter stop medding and go pull. 
}Yeah, and fighting requires your melee to turn on attack...

Does your attack key still work when you run out of hit points?  Somehow, 
your parallel here is lost on me.

}Bzzt, strike two.  And it's completely obvious that you've either never used
}pacify, or never had it fail.  Either way, that was so wrong it made me
}chuckle.  :)

No, actually, it is fairly right.  If it happens to fail, there is a 
chance, based (supposedly) on how high your charisma is, that the mobs 
will ignore your attempt to deceive them.  Even at 290 charisma, though, 
I've had my fair share of resisted pacs causing trains...

I would instantly choose a magician puller with a high Clue stat over even 
a monk with a low one.
