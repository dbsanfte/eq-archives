Cleric: DA... I know you think CHeal but clerics have tons of
other heals that are also nicer than anyone else's (cept maybe
Torpor sort of) but the ability to shrug off the aggro from healing
is priceless
Druid: Snare
Bard: charm
Beastlord: Pet CHeal er I mean pet level up line
Mage: mages cast spells?  Oh wait, pet summon is a spell isn't it?
Necro: there is no one spell or even spell line a necro can't do without,
they have a half dozen ways to kill things, take one away and they just
use another.
Enchanter: mez
Wizard: snare... too bad they get it so late in the game
Ranger: jolt.  Haha just read that line for wizards... try 52!
Paladin: stun
Shadowknight: I had no idea, we get spells?  Maybe I should buy some
sometime.
Shaman: Slow line
