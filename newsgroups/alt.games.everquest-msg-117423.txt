I have a 17"... and no visual impairment.  I run it at 640x480 for one 
reason only.  At higher resolutions, the dang spell icons are too small.  
I -wish- there was a command to make them the default size at higher 
resolutions.  I do most of my casting with the pointing device, and, being 
the chanter, it can be a bg mess if I miss that stupid little bubble.  But 
I find I'm more likely to hit the right one by trackball than by any of 
the assorted hotkey methods.  Especially if I have to change pages of 
hotkeys, and there just ain't enough spots on the one page I use.

So... I don't get transparent inventory either.  Sigh.
