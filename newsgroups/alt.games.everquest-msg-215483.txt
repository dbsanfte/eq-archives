If it costs you money to get the static it's prolly not worth it.
Just about anything you might want to do can be done on a dynamic ip.
My DSL is dynamic and I've had zero issue since day one.

As for VPN, just about anyone outside of the DoD doesn't care.  And
the DoD prolly doesn't let you in anyway....
