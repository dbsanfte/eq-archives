    You go up to the corpse in question, and try to drag it. If you weren't
online to see the "you have been consented" message, you have no other way
of knowing. Would be an interesting thing to add to /charinfo, wouldn't it?
Also note that if a person has multiple corpses in a zone, when someone
consents you only get the ability to drag the most recent corpse. You will
not be able to drag the older corpse(s) until the freshest one is cleared.
