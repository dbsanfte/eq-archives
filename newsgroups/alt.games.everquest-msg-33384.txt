When it happens to me (invisible hat and occasionally it takes the
hair with it) changing hats, zoning, nothing help. Only cure so far
seems to camp in old Norrath and hope for the best - camping in
Velious is a particularly good way to lose my hair.
I have a HQ wolf pelt I am reserving to make a reinforced cap for
these occasions...
