Let's take the last question first. Why do truffles cost so much?

Like other products, the price of truffles is a case of supply and
demand. Add into this that sometimes truffle production is very low
for weather reasons, and you have the basic status of truffle prices
worldwide.

Not all pigs are used to hunt all truffles. In France, sows are used
to search for truffles. But most truffle hunters actually use trained
dogs. Only young sows can be effectively used for truffles, because
they tend to eat what they find. Pigs are omnivorous. And once they
have dug up a truffle, they could easily bite the hand that tries to
rob them of what they have sniffed out.

Truffles may be closer to you than you think, even in New York. The
United States has many species of truffles. Over 50 species have been
described in science already, and about that many are still awaiting
scientific description at this time. Tuber lyonii (formerly T. rufum
var. nitidum) is known from New York, as well as at least one other
Tuber (true truffle). Several other hypogeous fungi are similarly
known from New York.

The problem for most people is not in finding truffles. It's a problem
of identification. There are 500 or more species of hypogeous
(underground) fungi currently known from the U.S., but there is no
guidebook or field guide to them. The best source of data on truffles
at this time is a computerized database compiled by the North American
Truffling Society.

The most varied source of truffles currently known is from the West
Coast of the United States, where truffles can be found with
Douglas-fir, Western hemlock, Pine species, and probably oak and other
tree species as well. Hazelnut (filbert) is also a favorite host tree
of many truffle species.

In the rest of the United States, truffles may be hosted by many
hardwoods, including oak, hawthorne, hazelnut, pecan, shagbark
hickory, American basswood, and others.

To learn more about truffles in the United States, I'd suggest joining
the North American Truffling Society, PO Box 296, Corvallis, OR 97339.
Cost is $10/person, and is tax-deductible as NATS is a non-profit
organization.
