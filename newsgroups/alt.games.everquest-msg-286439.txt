Cycle thru next NPC became my best friend quite a while back when I
was taking my enchanter thru SRO LDoN.  I don't know if they've fixed
it, but at the time for some reason mouse targetting was almost
impossible.  You would click and click on a mob and nothing would
happen.  Particularly for someone who has to mez this is pretty much a
disaster.  "Next mob" key saved the day.
