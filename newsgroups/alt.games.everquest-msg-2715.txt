I read with amusement a thread of posts involving camping and "Sharing" Camp
Sites.  To me if you are camping a rare spawn, fine, but if you just intend to
kill the same group over and over again, you need to at least share the kills. 
However, there are some morons (Usually High Levels or Newly Twinked Char.) who
seem to say things like "I GOT THE RUINS, DON'T COME NEAR" or "ELITE LEDGE IS
CAMPED" and two hours later they still are.  Give me a break, first come first
served, if I get the first shot, he's mine, if you get it, he's yours.
