Look for Dyschord's post on May 2nd.

From his numbers it looks like without Unfailing Divinity:
- 80% fail rate at 300 CHA
- 50% fail rate at 115 or so CHA
(The raw numbers given are 17% success at 305, 36% at 165, 62% at 72 CHA.)
Not really enough data there to fill in the curve.

With UD3 the rate was much better (1% failure for bard) but if you want the
details check Dyschord's posting.

It looks like they took the equivalent of 8.75 unrezzed deaths between
them testing this... about half of that by the poor, low-CHA shadowknight.
I'm assuming they used a 96 rez. Not to mention 800 emeralds... ouch.

The key stat is CHA on the target when the spell triggers.

Two emeralds for a ten minute duration? You're happy to burn 1K an
hour or so for this? DI is typically a raid-only spell because it is short
duration and ruinously expensive to cast (not that there aren't worse...
<wave> necro rez spell)
