There are a couple of things that I've noticed about some of our
newer guild members lately. One, I don't think can be changed.
The other, I'm not sure how to effectively deal with.

The first is something that, quite frankly, drives me *crazy*.
It's the 'I haven't been able to get a group for three days but
I don't want to go to/want to do X because the XP sucks.' Does
anyone else find this a weird way to be? The XP in Such-and-such
is slow so I'll sit here in PoK for three days and get no XP
whatsoever. I don't understand it and, no matter what I say,
it makes no difference in their attitude.

The second is the fact that we (the guild) have mid- to high-
level characters who know *nothing* about zones other than
PC or how to get to the various LDoN campsites or POI/POJ/BOT.
If you want to go to a zone that's more than a PoK book away,
it never fails that you have to walk half the people through
how to get there.

I think I'm going to propose to the guild that we start taking
'road trips' and go to zones that require a little travel to
get to.
