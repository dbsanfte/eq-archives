lol
actually, I didn't train the wedding.  our "mob" didn't even get close to
them, and we killed it.  I didn't die, nor did my friend, nor did any othyer
player.
We were simply too close to the "wedding" so as that they could "hear" the
fight and they got pissed.
They were over by the docks, and we were behind the tents.
I didn't give warning because we didn't even know the stupid thing was being
held in the first place, and I wasn't running to the actual DOCK dock...
just the area.
