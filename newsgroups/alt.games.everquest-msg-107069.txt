A few that stick out in my mind is.

1) There were no Griffons or Hill Giants in EC

2) 6 level 16 necros could kill a Hill Giant.  When the word first
came out no one believed it.

3) Most of the the high level spells were not in the game yet. That
would be anything over level 39.

4) What is a Flowing Black Robe?
