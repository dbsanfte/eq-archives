   This pretty much sums up how I've seen the initial dialog that started
this... whatever this has become.  It's hard for me to really call this a
flame war when the worst Julie has said to me is that I'm being immature
(and I'll concede that my stubbornness on this matter might very well be a
symptom of that) and I've implied that she is a control freak (I don't ask
that she concede anything).

   I would point out that despite what Julie has said, I really took no
offense until she started in with the personal insults.  She made what was
to her a perfectly reasonable request/advice/directive or whatever.  I
thought it was unreasonable and said that I would not follow it.  But I
didn't do so in anger.  

   But even if I had, this matter seems very trivial to me compared to the
amount of discussion it has generated.  Is that because we are both women? 
The subthread about the Jello and Whipped cream seems to indicate to me
that might be an issue to some.  Is is because we are both well known in or
respective newsgroups?  I think this plays a bigger part.  If no one had
jumped in, I think we would have made a few more snide posts to one
another, then walk away.  

  I'm quite ready to walk away now.  This whole matter has gotten way
beyond silly.  I for one do not consider Julie to my mortal enemy and have
no desire to fight with her in other venues (sorry jello wrestler fans).
