Not that returning might not be quicker, but dont' let the others
discourage you from getting a new key from VI if the store is
stonewalling you. I did it and it worked fine. Our second copy of Kunark
had the "key in use" problem. I contacted VI and they had me e-mail them
a scanner picture of the case with the account key visible, our receipt,
and they e-mailed me a new key the same day.
