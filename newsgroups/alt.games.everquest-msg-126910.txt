Don't know formula but's it's skill based... higher med = higher mana regen
when sitting

As far as I know these are all dependant on spell. Breeze = 2, clarity 9, c2
11, c3 14  mana per tick (Don't know necro) those are firm numbers
regardless of sitting/standing/dancing a jig etc

should be set number on mana regen also

Flowing thoght stacks. you have three items that give ft1, you have 3 points
of flowing thought. from what I understand you get one mana point per tick
per flowing thought, up to a max of 25 points of flowing thought. Don't
think this is affected by sitting standing either.

should stack with other mana regens. only regens that don't stack, iirc are
Chanter line of clarity... everything else that i know of will stack with
eachother... correct me if I'm wrong

No idea here myself... bards confuse me /snicker

Canna's are hp to mana. each one takes more hp for more mana returned...
don't know how efficency changes as you get each canni... that's more based
on hp regen, and casting time for mana rate... could probably increase with
fungi/regen, AA Hp, and spell casting time reduction items (or are all
canni's under 4 seconds?)

> Is that every mana regen issue in the game?

it's more than I'd ever try to consider at once :P
