    It was far too easily confused with ridicule or sarcasm to be considered
well meant I'm afraid. I also find it a bit hypocritical of you to be
annoyed at me for "seem[ing] to feel that [your first post] was
sufficient" - the only thing it wasn't sufficient to do was to convince me
that wis really did have the same effect on trade skillups than int. Now if
you want me to believe whatever you write off hand but keep hammering the
point that I'm a silly fool for believing anything I read, your point comes
across to me as a bit muddled.

    Not to mention the fact that you, Graham? Appear to be responding as
though you were also called Richard.
