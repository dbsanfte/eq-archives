 If you know how to manage aggro appropriately you wont normally get
summoned unless you're the main tank. So I'm not sure what you mean
"where do you plan on running to?". Basically you use jboots to keep
your buffs. It's not a matter of running anywhere except back to mobs
that also have knockback (such as the above mentioned Cazic and Inny).
