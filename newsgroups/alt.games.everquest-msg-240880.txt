anyone else have this problem? After the patch all the chat and system
fonts are changed to some squiggly tiny font that I can't even read.
So I can't read anything to even look for a place to change the fonts.
Tried looking around in eq.ini for a system font but couldn't find
anything. Tried changing screen resolution to make everything bigger
but still it's too small and squiggly to read. Yikes! How do I change
the system font back??
thx
