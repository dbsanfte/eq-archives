    You know about the ladders that lead out of the water, right? And about
the very low spot in the side of town with the necromancer guild, where
anyone can climb out?

    Hmm, and the belt doesn't have a recommended level on it, either. The
haste on the mask is pretty low, so I doubt you'd be able to tell just from
watching the pet.

    There's a bard vendor right near him. Bet a bard trained him to zone by
accident.

    At low levels, you can root-nuke or aggro kite (if you have a source of
enhanced speed). It's not mana efficient, but it doesn't involve you dying.
At level 12, you can start to charm solo. This would have been easiest had
you picked a DE, but que sera, sera. Charm mob A, sic him on mob B. When mob
A starts to get low on HPs, mez mob B, invis to break charm, nuke mob A
dead, charm mob B. Repeat. If mob A is winning the fight, let him win, get
the XP.

    At level 20, you can start meleeing again. You have two PBAoE stuns
which you can alternate while you take swings at the mob. Between the two,
you should be able to keep a mob locked down to about one swing at you every
12 seconds. Even an enchanter can survive that, especially if he's using
Berserker Strength and/or Rune for additional protection. You can also nuke
between stuns if that's more your cup of tea. I managed to get to 24 solo in
Lake of Ill Omen by doing that and by the following trick. Every so often
I'd run into a goblin and a sarnak fighting one another. If I didn't, with
root and mem blur I could set the situation up. Eventually one would get low
enough on life to start running. That's when I'd AoE mez (level 16 spell),
and kill each one with a single nuke. Between that and pet assisted
root-nuke I was able to get to 29. At that point, give up the solo act and
start grouping so you can learn how to best defend yourself against dumb
groupmates. That continues until 34, when you get a new nuke. ;-)

    If you have issues with health, switch to root-nuke with a pet up.
Between the pet, Tash, your fast-casting AoE stuns, Berserker STR (when you
get it), and root, stuff just won't be hurting you.

    Wizards are a lot more helpless about this sort of thing. Until they get
their snare at 29 they're strictly root-nukers, with the odd stun. And if
your cleric is old enough to remember what root-nuke was like for
efficiency, you know how bad that is.
