From the shadows, the mysterious Rumbledor <Rumbledor@HotMail.com> (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

>You see it all the time. 

I DO it all the time....


>A very high level player deciding they want to 
>roll up a new character and dumping 100kpp on them to start with.

Okay I never put that much gear on them. I don't seem to make money as
fast as most people, and my mains all somehow end up with no drop gear
that gets replaced with more no drop gear.


> Then they 
>take their uber druid and PL the hell out of the new character, jacking

Yes. Yes! Oh god, YES.


>My question, and I ask it in all seriousness, is is it really worth it?

Yes.


> I 
>mean, don't you wind up with a crippled mid-level character that coudn't 
>fend off a mob half their level?

No.

The ironic thing is offense, the one skill for melees that could have
suffered, goes up on damage shield hits.


> Doesn't it take an extremely long time for 
>all skills to catch up?

No.


> How can this be any more fun or time efficient that 
>just levelling up normally with good gear?

Fun is relative. I find it's actually quite an empty experience in the
end. But I do it anyways. Why? I don't know.


>What's the motivation for extreme powerlevelling?

Having a high end character in the class selected, of course.
