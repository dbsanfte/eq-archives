That's where it falls down. I could understand "char" as being short for 
character, which is what we mean. To imply "cartoon" by calling it a 
"toon", is quite unusual in this case. I'd feel pretty safe betting that 
the word "cartoon" appears nowhere in any of the EQ game manuals in 
reference to a player's in-game avatar.

Honestly, I've played my share of both RP and FPS, and I've only known 
the term "toon" to be used in this sense in recent times in EQ and Toon 
Town and never in FPS. I still consider it typically to be an attempt at 
being trendy. /shrug
