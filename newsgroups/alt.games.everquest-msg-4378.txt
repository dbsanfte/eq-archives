Problem is Nargums that no one normal sees any of you as viable
competitors in the game of life. People talk about short busses because
they are used to riding them. People use vulgarities and profanities
because the lack the ability to convey their point otherwise. The
reality is that new and better people have come to this ng. The olds one
can either conform or go away as their won't be much enjoyment for them
to come here everyday to argue and be objects of reticule.
There was a day when Lokari could come here and not see someone calling
her an ignorant fatass slut. Those days are over. Asked her how she
enjoys this ng now.
The old ones here are doing nothing but an exercise in futility. Their
time has come to pass and are but walking talking dead ones.
