The September 18, 2001 Los Angeles Times had information that no other "newspaper" has
yet reported.

"Mexican immigration officials said they had taken into custody a man identified as
Abdel Salem Imal, 26, near the Piedras Negras border crossing (about 100 miles
south-west from San Antonio) for carrying apparently false identification indicating
Brazilian nationality. Police searching Imal's baggage became suspicious after finding
telephone numbers for Afghanistan, New York, Canada and Germany and separate
identification showing a different name, Imad Mohammed Abed."

The reporting of news about who the FBI is seeking and where they came from has been
something worse than sketchy. That shouldn't be a surprise as these facts are directly
at odds with the policy of the American two party fraud that has been perpetrated upon
the American people. If the truth of how these animals got into the country is ever
focused upon the "open borders" policy that has invited the world to invade will have to
end. This would also end the central long term goal of the shadowy "New World Order"
that was proclaimed by George Bush Sr. back in 1991.

There is further evidence of a possible Mexican entry by the terrorists as well. The
same Los Angeles Times article reports the arrest of two others in Dallas:

"The FBI office in Dallas reported Monday that two men, Mohammed Abdo and Anwar Al
Marabi, were arrested over the weekend on immigration violations and were now being
questioned in connection with the attacks."

Of course no further information is available and you'll have a frustrating time
locating even this scrap of fact if you look somewhere other than the Los Angeles Times
(which did not give any notation as to the geographical proximity of the largely unheard
of border crossing known as "Piedras Negras" to San Antonio). However, there was an
article on the 18th of September in the Washington Post by Mary Beth Sheridan. This was
about U.S. Immigration policy and was less than favorable toward the backlash that may
be coming, but which the Post, Times (both L.A. and N.Y.) and the bogus flag waving TV
media are profoundly opposed to. Let's examine some of the nuggets of wisdom culled from
this piece:

"Fifteen of the 19 hijackers came into the country on tourist or business visas,
according to the U.S. official who did not want to be identified. Also, at least one of
the terrorists entered on an M-1 vocational-training visa, apparently to attend flight
school, the official said. There was no information on how the other three arrived.

FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III told reporters last week that some of the hijackers
were "out of status," a phrase meaning that they had either stayed beyond the limits of
their visas or sneaked into the country. He provided no further details.

In addition, 49 people who are related in some way to the investigation are in custody
for possible immigration violations, the Department of Justice announced yesterday.

"We're going to have to do a better job of making sure we know who comes into the
country, how long they're supposed to be here and whether they've left or not," said
Rep. Lamar S. Smith (R-Tex.), a member of the House immigration subcommittee.

In addition, he said, Congress needs to improve the system to ensure that visitors
eventually return home. He noted that about 40 percent of all undocumented immigrants
are people who came to the United States with visas but didn't leave when the visas
expired.

The number of people entering the United States to study, visit or work for short
periods has soared in recent years. From fiscal 1981 until 1998, the latest data
available, the number of annual admissions of visitors with visas nearly tripled to
about 30 million, according to INS data."

Clearly the entry point in the future for these monsters of Islam will be through
Mexico. Canada will tighten up its immigration laws in light of what has happened
whether that is from domestic embarrassment or pressure from Washington. Mexico though
cannot do anything about who gets into their country. This "Abdel Salem Imal" would not
have been detained if not for the world wide scale of revulsion and the high level of
consciousness that exists about the attack. Mexico is so ridiculous that a factory
worker in an "American" automobile assembly plant that once paid American workers $30 an
hour now pays Mexicans $5 per DAY. A police officer in Mexico does not make anymore than
that and most make less. Under normal circumstances this "Abdel Salem Imal" could have
given the immigration police there (probably making $20 per WEEK!) the equivalent of $5
and been on his way to America. These terrorists were paying $15,000 each to learn to
fly a plane plus their rent in nice middle class enclaves throughout America, all this
while not working a job to pay for any of this. Mexico is much cheaper to live.
Assembling "safe houses" and erecting an "underground railroad" through Mexico to
America is relatively simple and quite cheap for these wealthy, sophisticated characters
that are willing to work fulltime to make themselves into a human missile.

America may secure its airports to the point where this cannot happen again but these
terrorists will not go home or stay there because they cannot steal a jet plane. The
truck bomb that destroyed the Federal building in Oklahoma City is thought to have cost
less than $5,000 to assemble. That is one third the cost of training one human missile
to fly a jet plane. Imagine two hundred of these guys each driving a Ryder truck into
several American cities next September 11, 2002? The last truck bomb detonated in the
now obliterated World Trade Center almost took it out. Imagine four Ryder trucks rolling
into an underground garage, one loaded with the ammonium nitrate explosive and the other
three loaded floor to ceiling with 55 gallon drums of gasoline. The first truck parks in
the center on the top floor of the garage just underneath the first floor of the
building. The other three trucks then park along side the bomb and one behind. They then
gather together like four musketeers for Islam, yell "God is great!" and boooom! A
wicked, life destroying ball of fire goes straight up through several floors of the
skyscraper and likely three hours later the building collapses with most people still
trapped inside.

Sure there is a little wooden gate and a couple of "security" guards at the entrance to
the garage but is that going to stop four guys trying to blow themselves up?

It is also important to remember that this is the most rudimentary bomb that could be
assembled and these individuals have much better capabilities. Many have enough
education to manufacture a large quantity of C-4 plastic explosive and to acquire
flammable materials that produce temperatures several thousand degrees higher than
gasoline or jet fuel.

What about biological agents and nerve gas? These are things which are not beyond their
capabilities to produce.

In short, if they can get into America and stay here for months or longer than they will
strike again in the future. It is no longer theory, they now have experience. Close the
border with Mexico, seal it with troops or there will be more lethal incidents in the
future.
