WHile I have no direct knowledge at all of this, rumor has it that the 
"end game" in WOW is built around PvP regardless of what you do while 
leveling up.

I don't even know what that means, unless its some kind of "Highlander" 
deal where "there can be only one"?

I suppose it means that once you level up and get to a certain amount of 
gear, the only challenges left involve combat against other players, or 
that somehow the rewards at the high end of the game are only attainable 
by combat against other players.

And it could be that I got the rumor wrong, or that the rumor itself is 
completely false!
