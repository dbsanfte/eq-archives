I'm sure they really dumped the accounts, for a lot of reasons (going
from least to most compelling):

First, Blizzard has a pretty good reputation and they don't have any
reason to lie about it.  Also, unlike "number of subscribers" where
you can count free 14 day trials or multi-count "station accounts"
there's no obvious way to fudge the number.

Second, 70,000 accounts represents 1% of their player base (assuming
about 7,000,000 subscriptions, give or take).  Not an overwhelming
loss of revenue (but see below).

Third, they *must* ban some of the worst offenders.  If the gold
farmers or cheaters end up dominating the game, the ordinary players
will give up and leave.

Here's the killer argument: say you run a gold farming sweatshop, and
Blizzard just banned one of your accounts.  What do you do?  That's
right, you *buy*  another account.  Every time Blizzard bans a serous
gold farmer, they make money.  I'm sure that not all banned accounts
result in a new sale, but probably enough do that the financial impact
is pretty small.

This is a case where Blizzard is in the ideal spot where they can do
the right thing, look good, and not suffer at the bottom line.  In
essence, Blizzard can't kill the gold farming business, but they can
impose a tax on it.
