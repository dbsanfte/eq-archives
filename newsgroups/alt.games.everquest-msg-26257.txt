    I fought in The Warrens last night with Skin Like Diamond on my 14 NEC,
and Kobold Molars were dropping just fine. Another player was being PL'ed
there beside us, and not looting his kills - and his kills had Molars on
them, despite his being healed during combat. I imagine the Code only checks
against the levels of the people that got kill credit.
