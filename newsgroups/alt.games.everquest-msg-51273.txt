As someone who's veryinterested in buying a Multiple Online RPG, I'm reading
posts here and to be honest EQ seems so huge that I'm not sure if I could
learn and understand enough to play the game! I'm seeing big words and
fighting techniques I'm just not sure I could master.
So, if like me you don't know much about EQ at all, and you don't know
anyone who plays it, how easy is it to start playing and learn the rules? Is
it just a game for people who know what they're doing with games or can
anyone learn enough to enjoy the game without getting killed repeatedly?
My one other concern is the cost. I've seen the trilogy game in a store and
on the box it said "additional online fees" or something.... is there a
monthly bill?
