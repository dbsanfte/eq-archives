The PvP area is surrounded by a huge wall which blocks the
view of it from the non-PvP area, unless you stand at the "gate",
which is so far away from the PvP "platform" that it's very,
very difficult to see what's happening.

For all practical purposes, if you want to watch the action, you 
have to be sitting in the PvP area.  And every GM tournament, some
moron (or 3) decides to go around PK'ing the spectators.  Yes,
the GM's can discipline them -- no, that doesn't stop it from
happening almost every time anyway.

And the moment the tournament is over, another dozen or two
folks decide it's free-for-all time, and they see how many
spectators they can PK as the spectators make a run for the
gate into the non-PvP area.

I don't understand why they didn't make non-PvP "bleachers"
for the spectators.  Not only would this prevent audience
deaths, but if it were sloped like the Roman Coliseum,
the spectators would have a much better view as well.
