some cheaper routers can cause problems with games based on the Quake engine
(Quake, Half-Life, Counter-Strike, etc, etc) and Asheron's Call...

most are fine with all games though..

even with a cheap router, EverQuest was playable for me. (Efficient Networks
5260, upgraded to a 5660, stuck with a 2.2 firmware)
