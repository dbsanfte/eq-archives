I play on Fennin Ro and tonite ran into Thurgadin to bank and do some
baking and saw that Gage, the banker and some of the other NPCs had
lollipops over their right shoulder.  

I am not insane.

My first thought was perhaps I'd overindulged on that chocolate mousse
cheesecake.

A few minutes later, this poor guy waiting for a rez accidentally
attacked one of them and was promptly beaten to death with a lollipop.


I asked around and no one had a clue as to what was going on.  Can
anyone shed some light on this?  

thanks in advance
