Seven tradeskills, you left out Jewelry Making.  The best site I know of for
JC is
http://www.valendor.org/gumkak/jewelcraft.asp
Basically, you start with silver and a cheap jem and then skill up buying
more and more expensive jems, then you move on to the next metal and cheap
gem and work your way over.  The site lists the most opportune times to
switch metals so you are spending the least amount of money while still
succeeding enough to not lose too much on failures.
