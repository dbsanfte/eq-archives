Whenever I'm really bored and short of petty cash I kill all the non
uber guards in Freeport [1] and loot as many helms as I can in one
clearing and then turn them into the Paladin NPC in NFP.  Long since
maxed all my factions but I've moved my AA xp bar a few times with
Helms alone and you can get a few hundred plat in a fairly short space
of time.  I think 120pp from Helms was my record.  Sad but true.

[1] Killed one of the gate guards just to see it if could be done but
it took ages as they are resisty as all hell.  Took almost as long as
killing the PoD did.
