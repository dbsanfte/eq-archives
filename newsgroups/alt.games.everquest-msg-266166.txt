Wouldn't giving the account away be, like, the number one way to risk
losing it?  I can't think of a better way, anyway, although selling of
all your gear, deleting your characters, and creating new ones with
the same name would probably achieve the goal of removing much of the
incentive for going back.  But losing the account?  Of course most
people may not be aware that characters are never actually wiped, even
if you close the account, and there's nothing to stop them from doing
it, of course, except common sense.
