Manny,

I have found that it works in any type of game. it takes some time but it 
can be set up. The 1st step to setting it up is setting up the macros in 
the game itself. Then write all of the macros down with their 
descriptions. Open up sidewinder strategic commander (SSC), go to file 
then new. Make a name for the profile, in your case EQpaladin or EQmonk 
(whatever it is that you play). Go to the programmable  buttons option and 
click in an empty spot. look at what you wrote down for a macro and write 
the name of the macro in the description line at the bottom. Next to the 
command, type in the macro button or buttons that you wrote down and press 
enter. some keys don't work so you might have to use the insert special 
for those (ex: the enter button, mouse buttons, etc.) I think that a good 
way to use it for those types of games is to make the number 2 on your SSC 
your up arrow, #'s 4 and 6 strafe left and right, and your # 5 your down 
arrow. this way you can use your mouse and the sidewinder at the same time 
w/ out using the keyboard. I like the SSC because it shortens the amount 
of time used for looking for your macro keys. anyway good luck.

Lorak
