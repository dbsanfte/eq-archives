Yes, I've played my character to 60, I'm pretty well versed on Druid 
lore (at least as far as soloing goes) and --even if this comes as a 
surprise to you-- I've carefully read all the information available in 
the "da da" AA window. I've found the information provided there 
insufficient to make a decision, considering that any AA point means a 
commitment of many hours of play time; so I decided to ask people who 
may have some real, first hand experience of how those AA skills work in 
practice.

If you have a problem with that, I suggest that you killfile me straight 
away, because as long as people like Chris and Ben come forward with 
valuable information and insight, I'll keep asking these questions.
