I used to think the way you do, but now I fully disagree.

Find me another ISP that has as many access points as AOL around the world.

Find me another ISP that offers on the fly graphic compression so my web
browsing is faster for me.

Find me another ISP that actually RESPONDS to email when I send it (not that I
do it often).

Hell, they called me one time just to ask "how is everything going?  happy with
the service?"

Alot of people bash AOL (I used to aswell), but I have been nothing but happy
with them since I switched.  AOL 7 is the first client that I have issues with
EQ, normally my ping rates are so low, you'd think I was on cable.

But I degress.... I'm not interested in starting an AOL flame here in the EQ
thread.
