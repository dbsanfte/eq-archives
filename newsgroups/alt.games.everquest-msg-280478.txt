They are called noobs for a reason =) if I created a new toon and
wanted a quick way out of noob zone, I just attack th nearest NPC.
Usually fatal and after a minute you reload at the zone in or at
adjourning zone.  Plus if you do this before you reach level 10 you
lose nothing.

The loading time is often less than trying to find your way out of any
city.
