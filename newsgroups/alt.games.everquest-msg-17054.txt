"where"
/doability 1 (sense heading)
/loc

"Die!"
/attack
/say "Die you gravy sucking pig!" (or "Squirm in Fear, little worm!" or
"By the power of Marr, %T shall die!" or "All right, who ordered %T onna
stick?")
/doability 1
/loc
[note: this let's me get a loc at the start of the fight, which makes
finding my corpse easier, and by having a %T mentioned, my groupmates
are good at letting me know when I have one of them targeted by mistake]

"book"
/say Pardon me while I commune with my god. (or /em opens her book and
mutters a dark prayer. or /say Ouch! my nose is stuck in my book!)
/book
/doability 1
[note: this lets my groupmates know I am meditating, and please poke me
if y'all move]

"run"
/g I am running to the zone like a scared little girl
/g Y'all come too!
/g RUN RUN RUN

"panic"
/g Run for it- we aren't going to make it. RUN!
/shout Hey y'all- there's a weenie roast headed for the zone!
/loc
[note: "run" is used where there are no opportunities for anyone to get
hit by the train (i.e. already on the zone line). Sometimes I use both.
I found that if I just typed RUN, it was missed in the battle spam. So I
often hit both keys repeatedly, and they get the idea.]

"on me"
/g SOMEBODY IS EATING THE CLERIC- GET IT OFF PLEASE.
/loc
[note: I have been tempted to add the line "I can't heal you when I'm
DEAD!" but I think they already know.]

"heal"
/g By the power of Brell, let %T be healed!
/cast 1
/pause 5
/cast 1
[note: in case of fizzles, it will try to cast again]
