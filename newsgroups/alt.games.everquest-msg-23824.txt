There are 4 PvP servers & 36 regular servers & the regular servers have 2 to
3 times the population.  I would think that any EQ newsgroup or message
board would be used by better than 97% non-PvP players.  You PKers should
have your own newsgroup eh?

I have started characters on PvP servers.  Got one up to 10 level, only
reason I leveled him was to go back & kill the moron that was camping newbie
corpses in a starting area.  He was yelling "this is PvP, get used to it!"
to each & everyone he killed.  I had the whole zone cheering me on when I
got my revenge.  If I want to deal with punks I can always fire up Quake2 or
3 & go spank some & watch them cry & call me a bot.

Punks morons...  that's why I would NEVER play EQ PvP regularly.  Maybe
things would calm down post 40 level as the do on the regular servers.
Somewhere around 40+ you see less & less of the "punk-moron types" because
their reps are so screwed up no one will group with them & they can't get in
a decent guild.

Boukie (Boukie??) you post an obviously insulting question like that, then
get offended when people take shots back at you?  ROFL

Are you one of those "punk-morons" or just a troll?
