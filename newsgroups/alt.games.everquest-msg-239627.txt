This summer, CDS Books, Sony Online Entertainment and R. A. Salvatore will
jointly publish the first book in a series of novels based on the characters and
world of the immensely popular online role playing game EverQuest. Scott Ciencin
will pen the first novel in the series, The Rogue's Hour, to be released as a
hardcover publication in July.

    I'm just hoping (probably foolishly) that the novels are mix of EQ lore and
/ooc chatter similar to WTF comics.

   "Come, young Darkmoon, we shall go complete the quest to free the soul of the
dragon!  Just let me gate to the PoK and grab a KEI first..."
