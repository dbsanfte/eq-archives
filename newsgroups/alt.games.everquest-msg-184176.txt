If I don't understand something or have a little trouble believing 
something I'm told, you can bet your ass I'm going to come back with why 
that is. That way, when I'm wrong, and it sure happens often enough, I 
can be enlightened as to why. Are you going to believe everything you 
hear as long as you hear it from at least three people? I say give them 
ample opportunity to show me where I'm wrong, but don't automatically 
take everything your told as gospel right up front.

Besides, if this is so unbearable for you, feel free to exit the thread. 
I'm learning a little something here, both about powerlevelling and about 
you.
