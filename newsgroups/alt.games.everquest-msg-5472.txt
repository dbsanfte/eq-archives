Not a criticism but it was fun to kick deathpawn orc for the first time or
to take a snake.  My later chars are much better because of previous
experience.  I think the frst 10-12 are fairly easy and can be fun if played
with the right friends.  Why show up and u don't know who is good in a
fight.  Also why not just go God mode then and kill all the dragons?
Basically I have had fun playing not logging in to see some superhero all
the sudden.

Regarding kids/life - it is a game and you have to allocate accordingly - I
would do a couple of accounts and play together or perhaps play a common
char or something. I gave up Apple 2 Wizardry when my daughter was born 18
yrs ago so Im getting back to a similiar game.
