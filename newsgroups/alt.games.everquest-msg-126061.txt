There are 2 versions of the POTC quest. The one you have seen are the 
easy one, just require some porting and for around 750pp of store bought 
materials. This one you do if you just want the spell, since its NOT 
storebought, can only be gained through quests, and are nodrop.
The other version result in a nice druid earring too, or a nice FT1 
earring thats all/all if you prefer that one + the spell, but its hard, 
time (and inventory) consuming, and quite expensive.
Took me 3 days and 8K to do it first time, 2 days and 6K 2nd time, and 
spend a few days more to do it 2 more times (to make a full set of 9 
items for it, just need to put in a forge and press combine, no fail 
combine, to get the earring). Just to illustrate how hard this quest is, 
i sold the last 2 sets for 40 and 50K, too me a total of 30 min to sell 
them, including helping the buyers to FG and show them where to trade 
the druid only earring for the FT1 earring.
