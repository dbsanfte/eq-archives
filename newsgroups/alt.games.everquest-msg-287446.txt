shoulda read the beginning - it would be d&d, essentially, but with eq
doing the part of the pencils and paper and the mouthfuls of words
describing the world

the people who would play are the friends i have that are sick of eq
and would love to play classic eq, especially if the quests actually
meant something and worked toward a larger whole ... epic mobs don't
need to respawn because there isn't anyone playing here but us

you missed the point so entirely i'm going to only give you a cursory
response

the license is an agreement between two private parties; violation of
it subjects the violating party to damages under the contract, which,
in this case, would be $0

this is true and actually doesn't need to be said - however, i'm not
infringing upon their rights as i am allowed, by law, to use my lawful
license (not the EULA, but the license granted inherently by virtue of
the copyright statute that i obtained when i purchased the software)
in a way that is not excluded by their copyright

the long and short of it: i'm not preventing sony from receiving any
income by allowing ex-eq players to connect to a server that's
actually fun

and what's the penalty for going against this? i can't play on eq's
servers

what a shame we all quit years ago

this is a forum selection and cognivit clause; it doesn't mean i get
in any trouble for modifying the use of software i paid for

 it means if sony has legal beef with their users, those users must
come to california to defend under california law



the main point is there's a big difference between the LAW and private
agreements
