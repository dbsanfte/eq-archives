I recently had a friend do the same, I didn't get all that much for my char,
but have tons of stuff to start a rogue if I get the urge.  I just can't
seem to make myself sell it.  It was a total surprise when my friend
contacted me, and I'm still depressed about it.  :-(

Of course, not too depressed, it is a game after all, right?
