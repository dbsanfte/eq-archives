Take a look at the publically available campaign contributions.  Enron gave
far more money to Joe Lieberman than they did to Bush.  Your statement that
Bush is owned by big oil sounds good, since he is an oil man.  None the
less, the facts don't add up.  The democrats have their hands deeper than
the Reps (hmm, something about Occidental Petrolium....)

You know, but the 90's, the earth was supposed to be unliveable.  I'm all
for maintaining or improving the environment, but the Chicken Little act
gets a bit old.

Don't know much about ANWR, do you?  It's a small, small portion of the
reserve we want to drill in.  We've got the capability to do so without
making much of an impact at all.  Oh, and the wildlife you're concerned for
thrives near the current pipelines.
