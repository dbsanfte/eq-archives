The way my guild's website is set up, there is a News forum on the boards
that feeds directly into the front page without me doing anything extra
other than making a post into that forum (lots of other neat things on our
website, we have a full DKP tracking system that automates a lot of the
bookkeeping, a full mob/item database, semi-automated guild roster, etc.,
all working together in the background.  Love php!).

Any of the officers can post to the News forum, but it's semi-officially my
job to post the news posts because I'm funny.  Well, I think the
guildleader's exact words were "because you think you're funny".  Good
enough for me.  :)
