I noticed people kept telling you what levels were hell levels without
answering what hell levels actually ARE. Hell levels are levels that take
More exp to get through than levels around them... roughly 3 times the
exp... so if it took 1m exp to get from 29 to 30 it would take 3m to get
from 30 to 31... and then 1.4m to get to 32... each 'Hell level' gets
progressivly harder to get through... aka it takes More kills to get the
blue bar to move... Especially level 51+... during these levels you can kill
Massive abount of exp giving mobs and barely see the blue bar move much less
the yellow bar

and on a flip note many ppl (Myself included) consider the level AFTER a
hell level MiniHell levels... the exp you lose depends on the exp it took to
ding Last level... You lose more exp when you die in level 31 than you do
when you die in 32... Very noticable when you lose a full yellow of exp as
apposed to a blue or two...
