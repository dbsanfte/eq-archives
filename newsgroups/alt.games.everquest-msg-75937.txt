You have no idea what you are talking about, at all.

I'll be happy to offer some advice on weapons if you include information
on your level and budget; level makes a massive massive difference to
weapon choice. A level 58 uber weapon is not necessarily the right
choice for level 35, and certainly not for level 15... 

Yes, this means even if you have 80k to spend the 200pp weapon may
do more damage depending on your level. Too many idiots read about
their "uber friends uber loot" and then tell everyone its what they
should do with no understanding of why they're talking out of their
tushies.

Sui, 57 ranger
