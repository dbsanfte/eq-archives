Before you dive in, ask yourself..."Is worth it?"......Grinding like
mad for the next few days for this one raid could lead to a severe
case of burnout. There will always be more raids, and there is nothing
(item drops) in SolA that you have to worry about missing out on. You
can always go with your guild the next time.

It is possible.

Post your race/class. That way people can offer hunting areas that are
best suited to your classes style of play.

Also you need to have a leveling plan (1st choice zones/camps, 2nd,
and 3rd). You will need to plan ahead for purchasing spells and/or
training new skills. You don't want to waste a lot of time running
back and forth between your hunting grounds and your class guild.

Wed-Sun gives you 4 days. Since you need 8 levels you will have to set
a daily goal. 2-levels per day seems obvious, but it doens't take into
account the increased EXP required as you level. 3-2-2-1 might be a
doable goal, if you can find the right zone to do 22-25.
