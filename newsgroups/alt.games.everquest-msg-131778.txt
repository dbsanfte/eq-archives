EXACTLY. Too many druids now want to have their cake and eat it to, AT
LEVEL 60. This is not going to happen. Druids are still the most
convenient character, with ability to solo forever rather well with
escape spells and speed enhancing spells (as well as teleports to get
there) The druid class has done NOTHING but improve IN LEAPS AND
BOUNDS since the game was changed from 50 - 60. Its improved as much
or more than any other class in terms of what its class is, even
getting some VERY GOOD other heals.

The whole druid "we suck" thing is NOT because druids were crippled or
did not improve by comparison with clerics, but rather because in the
50 60 game people started liking to do new things that druids don't
really fit well with like AOE groups (prompting druids to now want a
group heal) Other classes fit well in AOE groups so this is balance,
if all your friends are always off together in AOE groups and don't
want you then its time to find some new regular group friends instead.
They exist, believe me.

As I said before druid has done nothing but improve, other classes
have simply improved also in appropriate ways. The cleric was always
king healer. It was king healer when it was the only one with superior
and complete heal and 90 percent resurrects in the old game, it still
is. People just settled for druids in a pinch more then. You'd find it
surprising but many people still will.

I love my 56 druid, its still fun, it can do more now and is more
powerful than it ever was before. Even at 56 chloroblast has saved
many other characters on guild raids while the clerics were busy in
the MT healing chain. I, with my fellow druids, have even greatly 
assisted keeping the MT alive by spam healing them when they had
aggro. Everyone has a purpose. A druid sucks until they just kept
three people alive and still have plenty of mana while the cleric was
busy.

The druid class has only got better, the high level game simply has
changed a bit. What has really happened is that people have forgotten
how to have fun and suddenly become lil maximum xp getting piggies.
The druid feels left out of that without better healing for AOE groups
and such. Oddly enough they don't feel left out when they can get
around well and go out and solo quad stuff at level 60. Its still the
same old thing, jealously. Quadding xp might have been the best option
for a druid so you heard no complaints then. The AOE craze came along
which would be a better option, druids don't fit well so you get
complaints.

So be a cleric if its that important to you I guess. I have a 56 druid
and 39 cleric and am having fun with both. I'll probably never even
get my cleric to where its competing for my time since other mmorpgs
will be coming out. Most of the time I like the druid freedom though,
get on, go out and kill stuff, do whatever the heck I want. Cleric has
to find a group of some sort and often do what other people want to
do.
