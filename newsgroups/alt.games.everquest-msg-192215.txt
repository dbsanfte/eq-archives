Go to Luclin, and try to get in a group in Dawnshroud Peaks.

The Tribals drop Acrylia on occasion, which you can sell for a decent amount
of plat.

Or you can try to join a Rockhopper group, but those suckers have a lot of
hit points, and you'd better have plenty of tanks and a healer with c3 in
your group if you try those.
