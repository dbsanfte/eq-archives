Ok, I'm ready for the "I told you so" from those who warn against 
cross-posting. I'm probably responsible for part of this because I 
cross-posted to my two favorite newsgroups and they have different residents 
with different contexts and different cultural norms. Julie is a regular in 
rpg and has been a CoH player for some time. She's seen a lot the posts that 
I've posted on that game and has witnessed the unfortunate Reg Le Crisp (an 
rpg regular) attempt in his feeble way to discredit my CoH posts, mostly 
because he didn't like the fact that I was having a good time. You see, Reg 
is a stalker of mine and watches for my posts and can't wait to respond to 
them. Julie knows this Reg guy and has been down this path with him before. 
Just like Richard Lawson (another CoH player) and Ben Sisson and some other 
EQ players who know this guy from RPG.

So when Reg posted his inevitable tribute to me, Annie (who maintains the 
FAQ in alt.games.everquest and has been there forever) was a good net 
citizen and spoke up both for me and for the game we both enjoyed so much. 
Julie in rpg saw this and attempted in her way to be a good net citizen by 
suggesting that Annie not feed the troll. Like many, Annie doesn't like to 
be told who to talk to and who not to, and I think the misunderstandings 
just snowballed from there to the point of unnecessary umbrage and 
alienation when I believe that everyone was trying to be helpful.

Of course, this is exactly the kind of thing that guys like Reg hope to 
incite, which is evidenced by his follow up reply to both women. I'd like to 
suggest that we just ignore my little stalker and let him speak to the hand, 
but you're of course both free to continue to respond in any way you'd like, 
heh.
