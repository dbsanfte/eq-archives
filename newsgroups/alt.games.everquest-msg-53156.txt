CoV is claws of Veeshan=Dragons.  Dwarves are Coldain.  Everyone starts
apprehensive to dwarves i think, might even be as low as dubious, and
KOS to both Dragons and Giants, with a few exceptions.  I think a Rallos
Zek worshipping Ogre, starts dubious to giants, and a Veeshan
worshipping Bard starts dubious to dragons.  

As to the original poster the dragon faction you raise in Mistmoore is
Ring of Scale, which is the Faction Gorenaire is on, not sure about
other kunark dragon factions.  You can only raise or lower velious
factions in velious.
