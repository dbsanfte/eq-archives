I spent an hour last night on groups.google.com checking out  EQDB's posting
history (yes ok I was very bored) and it made for good entertainment. I cant
decide whether he's a troll or a kook or what but two things I am sure of :
1. Rec.Roller-coaster(?) is very scary.
2. Sorry EQDB but if you said "I dont know why peole smoke blah blah" while i
was smoking in line I would punch you 'real' hard.
