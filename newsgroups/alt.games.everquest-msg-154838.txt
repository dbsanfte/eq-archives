Boats worked for a long time.  It's only in somewhat recent months that the
translocators have been semi-permanent.

That being said...  DON'T fix the boats!  Save the TL'ers!

The boats were one of the most worthless parts of the game.  Somewhat fun
the first time... a huge sucking waste of a half hour or hour every time
thereafter...
