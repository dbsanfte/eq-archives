I'm sorry, but what exactly is "random ganking"?

It strikes me that any method of trying to distinguish two groups of PvP
play into inappropriate or appropriate (while somehow making it superior to
what's already out there) is pretty much doomed to failure.  If you're going
to call some PKing but not others inappropriate, you'd better have a damn
good explanation on that distinction to give to the poor guy who gets
attacked and PKed against his will "appropriately".  And you'd better have a
similarly good explanation on that distinction to a guy who gets punished
for "inappropriate PKing".

And if it's a matter of the victim having to consent before he can be PKed,
so it's not against his will, well, that's been done.
