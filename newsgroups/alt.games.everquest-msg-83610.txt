This is useful if there are multiple nukers. That nuke the wizard is
casting may be enough to kill the mob, no point in having another
nuker cast at the same time if it just means overkill.

Also useful to let other debuffers know that slow is not needed.

Why not? That message lets the shaman know that maybe they can stick
malosi or something.

You know what happens when you assume? You make an ass out of u and
me.

I don't think the ones you list are useless at all. The only truly
useless ones are pure taunts, and emotes, and those provide
entertainment value, at least sometimes.
