Well, I'm annoyed that the log doesn't show start of intimidate.  Is 
there a way to have a hotkey command in a social, so I can do a "say 
staring intimidate" line at the same time as starting it?  I'd like to 
know how long the time between button press and intimidate going off 
really is.

Here I'm mashing intimidate every time it ungreys, within the limits of 
my reflex time.  Looks like thats an attempt every 11 seconds more or less.

As you can see, a kick.  I promise I didn't hit the kick button, this 
was from the intimidate

Resisted the "spell", aggroed him.

Took two seconds for me to hit auto attack.  Woeful, that is, 
considering I played a bard and could get 5 songs running, what kind of 
reaction time is this!

> [Mon Jul 12 22:11:04 2004] You try to slash a wooly mammoth, but miss!
My offense and 2hs skills are always within 5 points of cap for level, 
yet I seem to miss a lot.  Guess thats the melee game for you.

Frenzy for 42 now, not too shabby

Mammoth stun only lasts 3 seconds apparantly, seems longer.

Tried to get him back, but he avoided it.

OK, here's a double frenzy, missing on the first and hitting on the 
second.  So there must be multiple checks for frenzy, to see how many 
times it goes off and then for each to see if it hits.  What that latter 
is based on I can't say.

Regular intimidate failure, you can see from the slash at the same time 
that I was in melee range.

> [Mon Jul 12 22:11:28 2004] You have become better at Parry! (131)
Better at parry... but didn't successfully parry anything.

See?  Thats him hitting me, which is the attack that my parry increase 
came from.

> [Mon Jul 12 22:11:29 2004] A wooly mammoth suffers a blow to the head.
I love this, for some reason every time it lands I think "boot to the 
head, Ed Gruberman!"

Took 7 seconds for the mammoth to start attacking me again after the 
blow to the head.  I'm not clear on how stun works, but supposedly 
Berserker stun only lasts 4 seconds.  If he's attacking me every 3 
seconds, and refreshing during the time he's stunned, then stun should 
only slow him down by one second, he should be ready to swing the 
instant it wears off.  Instead, I see he didn't swing until 3 seconds 
after the 4 second stun... if those are the real numbers.

> [Mon Jul 12 22:11:39 2004] A wooly mammoth tries to gore YOU, but misses!
Here he is attacking me again 3 seconds after his last attack.

> [Mon Jul 12 22:11:42 2004] A wooly mammoth tries to gore YOU, but misses!
And again 3 seconds after that.

> [Mon Jul 12 22:11:44 2004] A wooly mammoth bashes YOU for 3 points of

Hmm, bashing me two seconds later, but not goring, bash must be on a 
second timer.

> [Mon Jul 12 22:11:50 2004] A wooly mammoth tries to gore YOU, but misses!
Six seconds between getting stunned and attacking me again, this time.

Triple frenzy, high end 52 hit, 116 points total damage off a single 
button press.  Too bad its not typical.

Better at double attack... but not succeding at it, thats a single slash 
above.

Mammoth attack 6 seconds after stun, again.

Actually I had HOS and Tuna at the very beginning of the fight, you can 
see them fade in the log.  They didn't do any good though, wearing off 
so early that I doubt they had any statistical effect at all.

Took a minute to get 10% hp regenned, sitting with Focussed Will running.

Oddly, focussed will lasted a minute 3 seconds, according to log here. 
Supposed to be one minute duration.

Pesky greenie.  Hitting me sitting, 16 must be his high end damage.

3 second delay, like the mammoth.  I understand that all mobs, unless 
hasted or slowed, have a 3 second delay, like pets.  Is that right? 
Looks right on this log.

> [Mon Jul 12 22:14:52 2004] Auto attack is on.
Five seconds to react, spin around, turn on autoattack.  Ijitsu master 
I'm not.

OK, explain this one.  Two handed weapon, double attack, but I see 4 
attack messages in one second.  Further, two of them are "too far away" 
and yet in the same second the other two are a regular miss and a hit!

He's running away now, after the 44 point hit from a red to him barbie.

Look at all these misses, on a green mob!  These aren't out of range 
cause he's fleeing, these are genuine misses.

Here's an intimidate success, not that it made any difference because 
he's already running, but you can see the kick land.  Weird thing is 
that it reports the damage twice, once as non melee and once as kick... 
I swear I didn't hit the kick button.

He's annoying me now, running in hilly terrain, so I snare him.

Really annoying getting to him on that slope, even though he's just 
standing there, finding the right spot so I'm in range is tricky.

> [Mon Jul 12 22:15:20 2004] You cannot see your target.

Now I'm in range but facing the wrong way.  Grr.

Finally found the spot where I can hit him!

> [Mon Jul 12 22:15:25 2004] Your fear spell has worn off.
Fear lasted 23 seconds, on a green mob.  I wasted all of them, in this 
instance, getting all of one swing in.  Not that it mattered in this 
case, but just saying.

Yay me, killing a greenie... and using up an axe to do it.

OK, why does a leopard have a puma skin?  Was he carrying it around 
looking for somewhere to bury it?  Was he wearing it under his normal 
outfit, like some guy wearing ladies' undergarments?
