For my two cps, I am a 30 pally, and I think that as long as you all
knew your roles (good communication is key) and there was a healer
present, the healer failed you.  I always hate it when i hit my macro
saying plz heal me and after the fight the healer says I knew you
needed healing. "I know what I'm doing..."  

At 2 bubs, they should be healing .. end of story.

Unless u banged it up somehow by pulling when no one else knew you
were, they should have been "assisting" the puller, and the healer
should need no prompts. If he or she does, run!
