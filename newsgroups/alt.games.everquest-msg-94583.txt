Thanks.  I think I may try this.  Would love to make myself a better
"bunker" for the group and be able to take more damage.  It's just that my
skills are on the lvl of about 20 or 25 I think.  Staying in a group on your
arse will do that to ya.  BTW, is it POSSIBLE for a cleric to melee him to
death at 42?
