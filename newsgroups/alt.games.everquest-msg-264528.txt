Traps on chests occur a lot more frequently when you are grouped than if
you are solo.  I have yet to have a chest that was trapped while soloing
(most of my time is solo).  Even while grouped, I have only seen one
chest that was trapped (which is admittedly a smaller sample size).
Maybe trap frequency increases with level increases?
