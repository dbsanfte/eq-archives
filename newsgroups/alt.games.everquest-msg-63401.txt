Ok ... third guild I'm in, third guild that falls apart and third guild that seems
to raid everytime outside my timezone. Ok, I'm playing on an american server
(euro server is slow to me) and the guilds are american, so they raid following
PST or EST. Now that's useless to me, so: Is there a BIG guild (something like
shining path, companions, royal norrathian guard etc), that places their raids
somewhere around GMT+1 18:00? I.e. a guild that is heavy on europeans, playing
in the evenings? With my main, I'm past the small guilds for fun part and
sick of guilds, that are just laoded with emotional people quitting all the
time. I'm longing for a stable, large guild, that has the classes online
when raiding and has people of my timezone. The server is mentioned in the
subject: The Tribunal.
