Like someone else said, there's no repercussion for being an ass
and ganging up on everyone that pops up.  It turns EQ into just a
video
game, like Mortal Combat or something.

Not my idea of fun, and if that's Verant's idea of PvP, well I'm not
interested in playing it.

Maybe what they should do is create a special server where all the
characters are NPC's whose goal it is to level, and you as a monster
try to kill them and give them XP loss.  Call it
"The Role Reversal server" aka the Nintendo server.

When I first zoned into Field of Bone, my impression was that it was
kinda
funny to see scorpions running backwards, and whirling around.  It
wasn't
so funny when I was in the pit getting attacked by two giant
scorpions,
a scaled wolf, and a spiderling all at once.  I'm only level 12, with
non-twinked armor and weapons.

Well, to my delight, Tallon Zek disabled the MPC option with the
emergency
patch.  Good move, Verant!
