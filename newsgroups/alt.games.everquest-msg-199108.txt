Well my worst is still Robvandam....just because I can't seem to escape him
(except by playing on FV) Whenever I log on he's walking past. That name has
been petitioned but nothing was done about it (GM did answer) so I figure
this sets a new precedent and I'll be making an assling ranger called Hulk
Hogan tonight ;ï¿½) I have obviously seen the offensive, racist/sexist bigot
or just plane crude names but GM's normally get those fixed...Although I
have had to sometimes explain WHY they should be changed...Which makes me
worry a little about the age (or experience in life) of some of the GM's.
