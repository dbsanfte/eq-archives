You're completely right.

In fact, you are so right I think you should vote with your wallet and go 
to some other game. When you call to cancel your account, make sure they 
know why so they can see your point.

You have *no* fucking clue what you are talking about. You want 5 9's *from 
a game*? Are you fucking retarded?

On the vanishingly small chance you are merely ignorant but not completely 
uneducable,  let me explain something to you. 5 9's is a myth in any IP 
server farm. It is only approachable by *huge* well-funded installations, 
and EQ is no such horse. NASA does not even get 5 9's out of their server 
farms. 5 9's is *5 minutes* of downtime a year. If you think this is 
possible on a server farm that consists of (5-100?) servers, a massive 
NFS/DB server, and multiple single points of failure (EG patch server, auth 
server) for the prices we pay, you are not only talking out of your ass, 
you are dribbling diarhea with your words.

Yours is perfect, I assume? Please describe the network you run, since I 
can tell you know sweet fuckall about the matter.
