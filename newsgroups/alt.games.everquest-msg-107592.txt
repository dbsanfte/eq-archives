I need some suggestions on upgrading my armor for my Level 8 Shaman on
Tunare Server. I have full set of patchwork armor which I
made(tailoring skill at 26 now). I have 80 PP in the bank. What would
be my best option for upgrading armor?

I have tried to buy banded armor in GFay, but got no responses. Can
you buy banded from vendors somewhere or does it have to be made by
players using Smithing? Any suggestions on how or where to purchase
some banded armor would be appreciated.

Or should I use my tailoring skill to make my own Studded Leather
armor? The only thing is I don't know where to get the metal studs
from. Any suggestions on where to get metal studs would also be
appreciated. Thanks.
