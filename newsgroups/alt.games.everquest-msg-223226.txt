To note, last I looked, the thread/instructions there gave you a line to
use, but it was incorrect/misleading.  To look at it looked like the command
was UseTNI=TRUE as in "Tommy Newton Indigo," and if you copied it it pasted
as "Tommy Newton 1" (numeral one), when in fact it's supposed to be "Tommy
Newton Lemon."  It also did not work with the setting as "true," I had to
change it to "1."  (Numeral one, the toggle thing.)  And it goes under your
Defaults in your eqclient.ini.

It'd be quite simple if it gave all the information (and gave it properly)
:D
