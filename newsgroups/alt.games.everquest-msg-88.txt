Actually, there are a lot of NPC's in EQ that you can ask directions
from. There are a lot of text triggers for npc's that are not [in
brackets]. In fact there are several NPC's that will lead you to
specific locations, like the guide clockworks in akanon. Go up and ask
one "where is the exit?", and he'll say "follow me to Butcherblock
exit" and head off.
