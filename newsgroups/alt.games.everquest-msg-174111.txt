I read alot of those posts.  Alot of the ones I did read ( mostly the 3
months nearest to now) involved them either being cheated by other employees
who actually did the stealing or bad management.  In one case even though HR
knew this guy was innocent and everything he said was true they wouldn't
bring him back even though they told him they would.  I read 2 cases where a
cashier went to lunch without closing her register only to come back with
some other employee stealing from it, framing her.  I don't know how hard it
would of been to close a register and then reopening it just for lunch,
probably a big hassle.

I did read one where a guy did stupidly use a best buy gift card when he
shouldn't of.
