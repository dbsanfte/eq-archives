	Well, I'm a 62 Ranger and I'd say we're in pretty good shape.  While there
might be a few minor issues that could use tweaking, there is nothing that we
really NEED.  The largest issue, I'd say, is that 2H weapons have gone
completely nonlinear, which hurts Rangers at the high end because many of them
are haste-locked into dual wielding.

	There is definitely a perception problem.  There are still people who
think it's the Dark Ages, the time right after Kunark, when Rangers would die
in seconds if they got agro and the company reps were going
LALALALALALAcan'thearyou if anyone said anything about it.  That hasn't been
true for a long time.  My equipment is not particularly good and I can tank
most of the yard trash in Storms if necessary; you just don't want me to.
Pre-PoP, I went from 55 to 60 mostly in Sebilis and the like, and had no
problem serving as MT in those zones (this was during the Velious era, and my
gear at the time was all Kunark-level, epics and Tolan's for the most part).

	As for soloing, at level 22 Rangers get the Panic Animal spell.  With
that, a trained rhesus monkey can solo a Ranger at least into the low 50's,
and to 60 if you really insist.  I earned around 90% of my experience solo up
to level 48 without Panic (that's when it went in), so it was certainly
possible to solo without it.
