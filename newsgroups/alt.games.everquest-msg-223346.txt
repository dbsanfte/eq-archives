You haven't heard my rants about Brynju and that
#%"%�/&%/%�/%�/�&%#%�%#�%#�%�#&%�#& 
non dropping around me hat, have you?

Maybe I'll try to get it again in january, or sometime I have time to
try to raid again.

(What irks me the most is that I saw it on one of the first bot raids
I went to, with guild (thus point bidding and not random), and PASSED
on it in the assumption I'd see it again!)
