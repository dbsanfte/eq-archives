STONEBRUNT!!!!

out of about 500 cat kills there, I've gotten exactly *0* ruined pelts!
LQ pelts usually one or 2 per kill
MQ maybe 1 every other kill
HQ maybe 1 every 3 or 4 kills
the "crap" pelt is a leopard skin (NOT the same as a tiger skin for the
wakizashi quest, these stack and have no use)

Most of the time they'll drop 2 or 3 pelts.

IMHO, farming SB for pelts is MUCH easier to get your tailoring up than
farming EK for silk (or UGuk)
Keep the LQ pelts for making leather padding, either to sell or use for your
own smithing (esp. if you're working on shawl skills).
And the HQ pelts you can keep for making quivers or reinforced later on
(Quivers trivial out at 115!)

As far as my tailoring plan has gone:
Silk to swatch/thread combines to 15 skill (better than using training
points because this step NEVER fails)
Patchwork to 26 (once again, better than training points, just farm a newbie
vendor)
Leather padding to 31 (stuck here while I level  =P) (if the silk threads
bother you, bribe a damn newbie like everyone else, on my warrior I got 2
stacks of silk thread for giving a level 4 monk a small sewing kit and a
toolbox filled with goodies, smithed shurikens and some raw/cured silk)
Studded leather to 56 (If you're planning on the prayer shawl, you've gotta
have all skills,so you might as well work on smithing, even if it does give
you CTS, God I hate metal bits)
Cured Silk to 80-something (Best choice for this step, more successes than
reinforced/quivers, so better cost effectiveness, also better than backpacks
due to price of HQ bear skins)
Reinforced leather to ~110 (Ditto on studded)
Quivers to 115
Then you're on to Wu's/Velious stuff where the real fun begins,
+10pp/combine or so =/ (once you get past crystalline silk anyways, it's
only about 3 or 4 pp/combine, assuming you hunt your own silk)
