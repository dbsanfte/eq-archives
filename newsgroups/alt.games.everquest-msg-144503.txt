Try to differentiate what is truely liberal, what is labeled "liberal", and
what is conservative.

What is "liberal"?  A liberal conservative.
What is "conservative"?  A conservative liberal.

For example, Ralph Nader is liberal.  Democrats are "liberal".  Republicans
are "conservative".  Simple.

As far as the media is concerned, mainstream media is both "liberal" and
"conservative", but certainly not truely liberal.
Watch mainstream media critically, and be aware of the role it plays as a
propaganda machine (see links regarding mainstream media below).

A few links of truely liberal news sources -

A piece from a post I made a while back....

**************

and who would be more biased? a profit-driven network or a non-profit
organization?  Who owns these networks?  Do they care about truth or their
best intestests?
you don't have to answer that question - just check out ALL the sites i've
given, read some of the articles (more than just one), and compare that news
to stuff CNN gives you... you'll see the answer for yourself.  If you think
they're all a bunch of theories.. can you refute these theories?  can you
refute the arguments that DO state hard facts (i'm sure you could find them
at ZMAG)?

WSWS is a socialist site, so assuming their views are socialist biased
(highly opposed to capitialist system), can you disprove claims made by this
socialist site?  I disprove claims made by CNN quite often (See sept 11 and
happy 4th threads).  What about ZMAG?  There is more than one article that
criticizes U.S. foreign policy... many that DO state facts and some directly
cite sources (Chomsky's work is highly recommended).  Of course, you can't
just visit one site.  I listed many.  You need to see many sites to see what
is consistent, accurate, and which sites are more reliable and less biased
than others so you can see for yourself...  and that's my whole point -
getting the "big" picture rather than that little bit our TV networks give
you.  How can you rely on a source that refuses to recognize claims
(opposing their own) that are strong and supported?  FNC ignored information
given by an arab man, even when he cited the International Red Cross and
Amnesty International as his sources - they claimed "factual innaccuracies
and liberal propaganda" and dropped the topic!  Is this a reliable news
source?  "Liberal propaganda!" is simply a way of NOT refuting the claims..
how about trying to refute the claims and proving that your claim isn't
bullshit?  Check out these sites often and compare to see for yourself how
they're biased and unreliable.

You can't just look at a few articles to see what a site is really worth..
read articles from the many different authors from many different sites..
some authors are clearly better than others.

some great links posted by pb2au regarding media bias.

Everything will have some bias... its up to you to see which are biased more
than others.. some clearly are.

*******************

Seeing that this thread is cross posted, don't expect a reply from me.. I'm
not going to waste my time with those who are too stubborn to learn
something and/or blinded by pride - and the large audience brings out quite
a few of those.  I've wasted too much of my time with cross posts in the
past.

I regularly visit and post over at alt.music.tool.  If you feel you have a
strong, supported argument that you can defend... by all means, post a new
thread there.  Intelligent and constructive thought is more than welcomed
there... from what I've seen.
