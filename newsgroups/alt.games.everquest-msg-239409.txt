I had the same in-game issues when I installed my new Logitech Mouse, the MX
700 Cordless.

After a bit of research, I found a file that installed an older version of
the Logitech drivers. Do a google search for mw973enu.exe, and that should
fix your problem.

If you can't find it, let me know and I can email the file to you.
