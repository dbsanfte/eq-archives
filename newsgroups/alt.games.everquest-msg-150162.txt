Ahhh rouges...half the problems with melee class balancing is due to
their fouled up damage table.
Problem with HGs are they are crappy xp at the levels they reasonably
give xp at. Seems verant has this high loot/low xp thing going with a
lot of mobs throughout the game. The only reason for anyone to hunt HG
is plat, level has nothing to do with it. Speaking of farmers just
what is that rouge doing anyway? Farming of course, have seen level 60
rouges clean out damn near every HG in Rath very quickly, engaged or
not. The favorite trick is to PP mobs engaged by others, they pop into
view and disappear so quickly its rare anyone sees them. Nope sorry
wont group or help any rouge unless I know them personally. Will never
rez one if on my cleric nor port one on my druid, just using my class
abilities to forward my own agenda just like they do. All because
verant thought it would be neat if they could PP.
