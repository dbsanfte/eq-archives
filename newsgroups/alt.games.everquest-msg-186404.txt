    And they never mention why, do they? ;-)

    People vote for a system with their feet. They don't like it, they
leave. From what I've seen with points, it's part-time players that really
get fed up and either cut back their playing time drastically or quit
entirely. If you can't get the stuff you've always dreamed of having, not
even one item, why bother going through all the hassle and work?

    That's a problem in officer award too, though. I remember once when
Rumblecrush was up (and he was a viable target at the time), and I was
trying to get people to move. There was only one officer online, though, and
he was one of the quiet ones that doesn't lead raids. One moron actually
said in guild chat, "But who will award the drops? We shouldn't go unless
someone can award the drops!" That's when the officer got so pissed that he
spammed "*** GO TO RUMBLECRUSH ***".

    Yeah, you see that a lot for lesser items. We once had to almost FORCE
someone to take a nice earring with about 50 HPs, right-clickable ITU and a
Riposte mod off VXAHR in Vex Thal. Nobody wanted to waste that "loot karma"
on something that wasn't really, really good, because they had no idea how
much "loot karma" the earring was worth.

    Many guilds on points also inflate the cost of all droppable items to
discourage people from buying up stuff for sale in The Bazaar or on
Playerauctions. Do you give back full points if an item is returned, or only
a percentage?

    It's not hard to know what others want. On our guild board we've even
had a few "what are your dream items" posts started by officers to help them
determine what our priorities should be. And as well you can imagine, the
reasons for spite are many. =/

    So you do have class restrictions? Ooh, I have an item for you! There's
a 17 DAM piercer that drops in PoEarthB that is rogue-usable, but is also a
percussion instrument with a higher percussion mod than the bard epic. Who
should that be restricted to, without causing any jealousy or other issues?
According to your rules, it's a rogue weapon for sure!

    See how miserable loot rules can be to create? ;-)

    It's not easy. If people don't want to pay the points for it, what do
you do? Force someone to take it? Go to some sort of bidding? If you go to
bidding, what's to stop a given class from colluding to "fix" points costs
on any item specific to them?

    On my server, the only Abashi's Rod of Disempowerment that ever dropped
off Vulak rotted because the one monk in the uber guild that was present
didn't want to waste points on it - he was saving up to catch someone else
and get in on the good all/all stuff. It makes you cringe, but it'll happen.
(They had a policy that anything refused by everyone rotted, so as to be
fair to everyone who may have paid full points to get something.)

    Then get ready for stragglers to be left behind, unless they're popular.
I saw that in my guild, to some extent. We're only killing General and
Advisor to get folks key pieces? I have to wash my hair tonight, later! And
that sort of pressure to get your key first so you aren't screwed when the
lootwhores of the guild decide they've done something enough and it can't
improve THEM anyways makes the entire keying process that much worse for
everyone.

    Your BST twink is 55? Too much free time on your hands!!

    When some of my guild's people ask for help doing a shawl run, it's
embarassing how silent guild chat becomes. The few that do respond are
usually very curious who will be getting the secondary drops.
