Yup, must be .. certainly wasn't need and wasn't wanted by a lot of
the people whose classes were going to get squeezed (monks and rangers
spring to mind).

My highest alt is a necro ... bet thing I have seen about them that
you don't mention is that the 49+ level pets can often outdamage the
tanks in the group (unless they are twinked to the eyeballs!) as well
as the role you list above.  Pre-49 bit of a waste of space in a group
but post 49 I'll give them room anytime.

Never really been impressed with necro mez though ... maybe my DE just
hasn't got the charisma to pull it off.
