Well they only forbid you from training them with guards, not RPing
<EG>.  A long time ago my friends and I used to have an all DE group we
toyed with some times.  Verbally harrassing DE guard killers from the
perspective of a DE is not only allowed, but provided great fun.  The
best I recall was a paladin of a level high enough to be killing the
bigger guards who challenged me to a duel for my DE cleric's preaching
of The Hate to him and his group.  I was actually cheering them on for
providing further fuel for The Father with their violence and how He
would consider them His servants as they did His work spreading Hatred. 
Once he challenged me to a duel I was able to discuss just how brave he
was to offer to kill a poor defenseless holy man.  Yup, plenty good RP
opportunity there without breaking any rules.
