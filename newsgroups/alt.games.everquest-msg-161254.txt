Try the rear of the temple in the Grey.  It is a great fear kiting
spot and should be manageable for the two of you.  It is often camped,
but if you can get it, you can get good experience and some nice loot
of the named mobs that spawn.  You are not going to be able to fear
the named snakes, so be prepared to root/rot them.
