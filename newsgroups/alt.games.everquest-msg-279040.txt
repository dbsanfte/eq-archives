If it's not the fan I'd check the power supply.  It may be failing and
causing shut down when CPU tries to draw more power.  If there's been
any recently added hardware (hard drive, etc) try unplugging that for
a moment to see if that stops the shutdown.

Also if the computer is overclocked, I had this problem last year when
I pushed OCing a bit too far and when running under full load the RAM
just balked and caused the game to quit.
