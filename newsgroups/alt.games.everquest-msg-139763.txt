Neither EQ nor DAOC were designed for PvP. DAOC was designed for RvR. 
Neither includes limits for unguilded people along with set geographic
strongpoints for guilds that can be punished for their actions.

Well no one can stop your own guildmates from ganking you except
moving to a better guild.  But if other guilds attack you then simply
add them to the KOS list for your towns guards, and find out where
their home base is. You could either attack it directly or kill of
anything around it thus choking its resource base.

In Shadowbane you don't have to complain to another guildmaster all
you have to do is set a software switch and the other guild gets
attacked when they get close to your territory.

The guilds with the discipline in shadowbane will be the ones capable
of carrying out the multiple real time day sieges of others towns
whereas the halfassed guilds will not be coordinated enough. 
Even small guilds will have power in that they can agree to provide
protection for cities in return for protection back, or trade
agreements.

A flaw in EQ's geography, using zones with dead end cities. There are
no zones in shadowbane and no dead end cities.  Each city has a zone
of control so if you piss of a city you will have to detour around its
controlled space.

Well see, I think players can find away around any system you just
have to make it not worth the time and effort.
