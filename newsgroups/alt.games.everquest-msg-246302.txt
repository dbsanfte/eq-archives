}Could this finally be Sony's big move to rule the world?

Patch Message June 2006
-----------------------

- Blue collar classes were found to be able to get far too much work done 
for too little pay.  Their ability to work has been reduced to compensate 
for this effect.

- In an effort to combat inflation, gambling has been legalized worldwide.

- Drug users were found to be having far too much fun for the effort 
involved.  The effect of marijuana has been cut to 10% of its prior value, 
and its drop rate has been reduced.  The 'Get High' skill was raised to 
200 for all players, however.

- Democrats and Republicans have had faction issues for far too long.  New 
quests have been implemented to allow raising these factions.
