Well I can see the point about a good whine :) Most of the characters in the
recent monk nerf have well over 50 or even 100 DAYS played. Thats 2400 hours
or the equivalent of going out and earning $36,000 to us average run of the
mill working stiffs.

On the other hand eventually Sony is going to notice that they fucked up and
fix things. So I am just playing my chanter instead of my monk . I certainly
respect the right to whine about it though :p
