How often do you come back from AFK only to find someone else standing
almost exactly where you are at, making it near impossible for you to sell
because others can't right click on you (due to the other person in your
way)?  I've noticed this quite often.  However I've never been able to get
back to my spot because I was standing close enough to the edge of the
trader area to hopefully prevent this.  I know the other is always in front
of me or exactly on the same place as me because I am inside their polygon
body looking out from their chest or face.  Usually it's not big Ogres, but
humans or Dark Elf or other normal sized races.  And I'm a DE as well.
Anyone else see this as a common (but far less respectable) practice?  What
can be done to prevent this?
