I recently took advantage of the deal where you get a free account
with the first two expansions, though you could only play on the new
server until you paid for the account. So I paid for it and made my
new Warrior on FVie.

However, I'm having a few problems, which may be associated with
2Boxing with WinEQ, or maybe something else.

1.) My Warrior can not be invited to a raid. When he is invited, no
offer shows up for him. He can not bring up the raid window (alt+r)
either.

2.) Sometimes he can't use the map window. It seems to be a zone
related thing, or possibly an issue with WinEQ. He can bring up the
map in his home town and the newbie zones for each of the starting
cities I have tested, but can not open his map in PoK or most other
zones. (Actually when you mouse over the map icon in the tool bar it
does not light up like the other buttons.)

3.) He can't zone into Paniel. I actually had this problem back when I
first started playing EQ about 4 years back. I remember using the
thorough file check to fix it, but this time it didn't work. What
files do I have to delete to fix that?

Are the first two things limitations due to having only the first two
expansions on the account, or are they caused by something else? Not
being able to open the map in PoK is annoying, because he has to run
with his head down to avoid being hopelessly stuck in video lag. (My
machine doesnï¿½t quite have the horse power to run both EQ clients at
the same time with one or both in PoK without a lot of video lag, even
with the new models turned off. (Talking 20 frames per _minute_ with
his head up near the Nexus stone.) Not being able to Raid is going to
be a big pain since I made this Warrior to be the main tank for some
small raids we are hoping to run. I want to know if buying the other
expansions will fix the issue before I plunk down the money for them.

Thanks for any assistance.
