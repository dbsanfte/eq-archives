New to EQ, and this question may have been answered previously, but, here's
what's happening:
AMD 1 gig, 384mb ram, 16mb Vanta video, WinME
When 1st played the game, this didn't happen.
I use ctrl-alt-delete, and close all programs xcept the
2 that have to be in there, explorer and systray, so the
machine is pretty much clean when playing. No virus
programs running or anything.
The text box, is jumping so much that you can't hardly
read what's displayed. And sometimes, it takes minutes
for what you've typed, or someone else has typed to
display. Even in the chat room, the text will disappear,
until the next person types a message, then it all reappears. The only thing
that appears in the options setup is "primary video driver" or something to
that effect. So I can't do any other setups, or even a setup on that.
Can anyone help?
BTW, this doesn't happen on 2 of my other computers, a PIII 600, 384mb ram,
32mb video, Win98se and a
PIII 800, 384mb ram, 16mb Vanta video, WinME
