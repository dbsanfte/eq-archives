I get a lot of "Can u sow plz?" I usually respond with "I'm sorry, I don't
understand the language you're speaking." The ones that "get it" and ask
properly will get their SoW AND a buff or two.

Remember that we can Bind, too, and you might want one someday.

I have my inspect message turned off because I figure there's nothing I can do
about it, so I might as well not know. I ALWAYS apologize if I inspect someone
by accident (usually in the Kelethin bank).

I tried responding to beggars politely but now I just say "No. Go kill things,
loot the corpses and sell the loot."
