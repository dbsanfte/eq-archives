Sometimes i think do thoes high level players really play fair or not?
They can sometimes be real idiots.. thats why! Can EQ be hackked?
I hope not! That would need an access to the server files..
and that needs what? username and password? i really don't know
mutch nothing about hacking, but i do know that password
don't protect that mutch when somebody really want's something!
Anyway it would not be that easy i know, but i believe it can be done
maybe someone has allready done it.. What do you guys think?

hacker would say to this that theres nothing that can't be hackked!
Who really want's to hack EverQuest anyway? i wonder..
maybe someone who is a real idiot lameass, but theres no way
lameasses can hack!
