Cazic Thule is a great dungeon.

I like SolA, but it's hard to find a pickup group there.

Mistmoore is a pain in the butt, too buggy, but you can get some xp at 29.

Upper Guk I've never really hunted.  You'd have to get in deep at 29 and you'd
be outta luck if you got in trouble unless you could evac.
