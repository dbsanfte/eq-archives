Missing seem to be DoN and DoH, and the upcoming PoR.

Whats the content on those?  I'm generally not interested in raiding, at 
least not in the intensive days on end repeatedly raiding the same zone 
to build up in order to raid the next higher zone kind of raiding.

I love new classes, and to a lesser extent new races, and enjoy the low 
end game perhaps more than the high end; 1-50 more than 51-60, and that 
more than 61-65.  Never even bothered with 66-70, although thats 
something I'm toying with for my return, as I do have a couple 65s, and 
the game is going to 75 soon, right?

I've heard rumor that PoR will have content 1-65, sufficient that 
someone could literally progress without leaving the PoR content area at 
all.  That would be almost like a whole new game, just using the 
existing game mechanics.  Could be a dream come true.
