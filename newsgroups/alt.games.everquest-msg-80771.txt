It's for the second step of the Earring of Veracity quest.  An NPC asks you
to swap fake documents with those in the file.  You 'give' the documents to
the cabinet, get 'real' documents back, a KoS guard spawns and you give the
NPC his documents.

Me, I took the NPCs advice and "went with stealth" for the hand-in.  Guard
never knew I was there.
