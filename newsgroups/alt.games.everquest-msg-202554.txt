Patches usually require changes both client and serverside.  Old clients 
are probably not compatible with new server software, and new clients are 
probably not compatible with old server software.  Also, one "server" is 
not a single machine, each "server" is actually composed of multiple 
physical computers that each manage one or more zones for that "server".  
Not to say that it would be impossible, but, the difficulty in managing 
it does go up, which also raises the cost of doing it, and, likely it is 
just not cost effective for them to do that.  People are not leaving in 
droves as a result of the way it currently works, it's worked this way 
for years now.
