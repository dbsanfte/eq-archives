  Now that I've had time to fully check out the new zones...

  Lavastorm looks nice...for what's being planned, I guess. I would feel 
better about
it if I didn't like the old LS so much. It had a great view from the valley 
floor up the
loooong shallow slope to the lave lake, gave it a tremendously ominous feel. 
I
suppose, however, this is what EQ2 players enjoy as their normal zone 
appearances.
I hope when the other picturesque zones are redone, the devs try to keep the 
things
that people routinely take screenshot of: the cliff carvings in West Karana, 
the
architecture of Kelethin and Felwithe, the front of Kaladim in Butcherblock.

  At least the geometry of Mistmoore and Splitpaw haven't been redone...yet. 
Only
the mobs have been changed. Makes it tough to explore them, everything sees 
invis
now, but the drops seems to be good.

  The DoN zones are okay. Stillmoon Temple gives a nice training dojo 
atmosphere.
Haven't tried the instanced zones yet.
