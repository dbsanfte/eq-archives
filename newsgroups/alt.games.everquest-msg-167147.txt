I dunno about your server, but on EMarr, SK is almost always totally 
deserted - once one spire became trivial, I simply started pulling two 
spires.  Then three.  I stayed there until 30 (but then, I didn't get my 
24 pet, so not sure how he is at tanking, and fear kiting there was so 
damn easy...), then moved to OT.  Being a DE, I can sit right outside 
the walls of the outpost and fear kite.  DO NOT pull the rhinos, they're 
super fast even if you're sowed and they're snared, and a real pita to 
finish off, plus, crap loot.  The cactii are one of the best pulls - 
loot isn't so good but even unsnared they're slow, so a resist or two 
isn't a problem.  Oh, and did I mention?  They aren't social, either. :)
