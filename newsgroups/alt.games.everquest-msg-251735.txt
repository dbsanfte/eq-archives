That's true. And, it's often in adverse circumstances like the loss of
a friend that we see a person's true strength of character or lack
thereof come out.

FTR, in nearly five years of playing EverQuest an average of twenty
hours a week, I've come to know exactly one person who plays to the
point where he's clearly had to make real sacrifices to be that
active. While it's sad, I would be hard-pressed to believe that he
would have done something productive with the time instead. That's one
person in five years and I'm a pretty hard-core geek who surrounds
himself with a fair number of geeks and freaks.

So, when someone claims to have several friends and family members
whose lives have been wrecked by EQ, I immediately assume they are
full of shit or from some weird, dysfunctional subculture where, if
there were no EQ, their friends and family would still be yelling at
each other about innacuracies in the uniforms they made themselves for
the big Babylon 5 convention.
