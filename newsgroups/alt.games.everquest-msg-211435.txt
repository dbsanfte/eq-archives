Hmm... but by saying that, you then imply that Haste directly
increases damage according to its modifier which isn't right. Haste
indirectly increases damage based on the number of swings, but
directly increases number of swings based on its modifier.

Bah, guess one has to be anal-retentive to skew words like that. :)
