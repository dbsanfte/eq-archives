I had a cleric I got to 34 or so that was twinked but not to any outrageous 
degree, and I had my WIS well over 200. As I understand it, INT is just as 
easy to raise through equipment.

I rolled up a human enchanter (I like to be different) and dumped all the 
points I could into STA and 5 into INT. I'm confident I'll be able to raise 
INT and CHA well enough through gear, and the extra STA (much harder to 
raise) will likely come in handy someday.
