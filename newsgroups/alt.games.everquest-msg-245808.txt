	Again, what about it?  Imagine if, up until the release of elemental gear, 
the best armor in EQ was made by a dedicated crafting class that did nothing 
else.  And then all of a sudden the best armor is made from dropped components.

	The point is that is just not the deal dedicated crafters want.

	Without a dedicated crafter class, your original point (that the best items 
should require some input from crafters) is really moot.

	Well, you're essentially using an ad populum argument to defend SWG; I'm just 
pointing out that on that basis, it still loses.

	Eh, I play a lot of D2 myself and in terms of socializing it just doesn't 
compare.

	No, that would make it good from a commercial standpoint.  Would you argue 
that Britney Spears' music is good from an objective standpoint?  (Would you 
argue that Britney Spears makes music, for that matter? :-) )

	Less of a need for that in EQ; they don't seem to have purged characters over 
level 3 ever.  My EQ account is currently cancelled, in fact.  I can only 
afford two of these things at any given time.  SWG is hanging on because my 
regular gaming partner isn't done with it yet, so EQ took the hit for CoH.
