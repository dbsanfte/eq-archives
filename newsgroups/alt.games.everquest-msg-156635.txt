Absor from the Developers' Corner:
=========================
Planes of Power launches this afternoon.
We brought the servers up this morning to do a quick sanity check. This
allowed us to correct the few remaining issues that generally come up once
the data moves over to the Live servers. Everything is looking great for our
launch in a few hours.

Thanks for all of the help everyone has given us in testing Planes of Power.
It looks like it's going to be a great launch!

=========================

Hmmmm ... though the servers were up this morning for a 'sanity check',
interestingly enough I just patched yet another new version of eqgame.exe
..... ;-)
