Or they are broken NPCs who won't/can't do what they were supposed
to be doing, until a patch fixes the problem.  Sort of place holders
for the working NPCs.

Btw, I saw a guy in the EC tunnel fighting a human NPC labeled:
"!the ground."  Yeah, that's right, he was fighting the ground.
LOL!  Mostly he just stood there while !the ground kept missing
him; finally he had enough and killed it with one hit.  Weird!
