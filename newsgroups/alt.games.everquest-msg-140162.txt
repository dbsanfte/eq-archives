It's funny you should ask this, I've had trouble
trading focus items for a port.

Sounds like everything but the necklace (conservation)
is worthwhile to you - Earring and Bracer for more
efficient nuking (an average of 21% more damage for
the mana between the 2 of them), and the mantle for
15% longer buffs (get this before you aego the mage :)
Most of the healers I group with really like the ring,
a slightly faster heal has save a few caster's lives.

Something I haven't seen numbers on - does the mantle
stack with spell casting reinforcement?  I'm thinking
KEI from a 'chanter with SCR, SCR Mastery and a Extended
Enhancement 3 item would last close to 4 hours :)
