The portals in the Nexus are bugged too.  There is no announcement for
any of the firings except Velious.  All of the other portals fire without
warning.  When they first released Luclin, they did announce all firings,
but a later patch broke it.

Also, be careful where you are standing.  Even if you are not on the pad, but
still in the little portal room or in the "doorway" to the room, you may
still get transported.  Stay well outside the little room if you don't
want to go on the next firing.
