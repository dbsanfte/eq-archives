I'd heard from several others that their adventure stone wasnt getting
better as advertised.  So I checked it out.  My verdant something charm with
adventure stone augment has always given 5ac in ldon.  I got my 10th success
in tak last night so today I talked to the adventure lady.  The game told me
my adventure stone gained in power, but then when I went to the dungeon I
found that the charm still gives 5ac same as before.  Has anyone ever seen
any improvement in the stone, or is it busted all around?
