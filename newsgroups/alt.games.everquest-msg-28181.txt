Scary as it sounds, you're not too far off.
Wanna know what's the single biggest factor in the end game?  /disc
defensive.  I'm not kidding, that discipline makes or breaks
encounters.

When you have mobs that can generate 3400+ hps of damage *PER COMBAT
ROUND*, it's not possible to do them without level 55+ warriors with
defensive up.

The implication of course is that hybrids will NEVER be able to fill
the role of "tanks" against these mobs.  No way, no how.
