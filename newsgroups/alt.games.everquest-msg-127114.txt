Okay, if it was only one single gate-or-die incidence, I'll let you
off the hook. You made it sound like something you deliberately did
for amusement.

I use summoned pet for farming and charmed pets for exp. Done
correctly, it is perfectly safe, and if I don't have a mass of
untimely spellbreaks, I can kill two dark blue mobs in a minute or two
and have a net mana gain.

However, I have no clue what you are getting at with "more than 100
mana to use".
