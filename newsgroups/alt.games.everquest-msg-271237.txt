Not true, there is a restriction, when my level 18 shaman tried to group 
with a level 25, I got a message saying I would not get any xp or any 
quest credit for anything we did.  Grouped with a 24, I had no such 
issues, but, yes, the rest of the description on cons is correct.

One thing to note, this is actually quite handy for doing some quests, 
group with a high level in the zone, and you can run freely around mobs 
that would normally attack and kill you, as they all con grey to your 
group now.
