If major exp comes from quests, they have to block quest repetition in 
some manner, period.

The bazaar constantly changes what is 'level appropriate' for a level, 
say, 45 character. Designing, bug testing, implementing, and debuging 
the missed bugs on quests take them too long. They really need to 
redesign their quest implementation system to make them easier to add.

Just more mudflation from a different source. EQ is right on the edge of 
having too much of that already.

Not just no, hell no, to the find trail and compass marking. The logbook 
would be nice though.

Very Final Fantasyish. I can invite a person in the same 'region' as me 
(regions are groups of zones), through the search pane.

Yes in general but let me hide my alts.

The only way I see this working is level capping the higher level player 
to the lower level. On balance makeing odd levels work together 
effectivly without altering their effective level is very difficult.

Variety is good.
