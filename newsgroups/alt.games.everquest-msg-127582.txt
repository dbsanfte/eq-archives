1) Logged into DL (please don't laugh) and solo'd a few gnashers before
work.  Like 4....
2) Ran to FM zone line to log...
3) Got to about 10 seconds left, then I got a message that I was rooted by a
Drachnid....
4) Fear, Instill, Bellows, charm, mezz....everything I had was "too far
away"...

I died, no biggie...I ran to my corpse, sat down and logged.  Logged back in
right next to a level 60 Cleric sitting next to my body.  Like that will
ever happen again...

Got a full rez, but how often does this happen?  It was "invisible", was out
of range of anything I could do,  and I imagine was up the hill, on top of
me.

Sean...
