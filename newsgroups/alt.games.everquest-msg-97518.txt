My druid was a friends character/account I took over when he quit for good
to play DAoC, he was low 40's and had worse equipment than you (bracers were
studded leather!) anyway

Head - Othmir Cap (player made I believe) as an upgrade but nothing wrong
there otherwise

Face -  Plat/Vel ruby veil. Platinum you should be able to get for about
300 - 400 now as everyone one wants Velium (+7wis/str or +8 wis/str)

Ears - Fine, another forest loop maybe but I don't even have 1 forest loop

Neck - I wear the same, not much better at this level (my druids now 50 and
still wearing one, btw)

Shoulders - Good, nothing to offer that is better and easily obtainable atm

Arms - Fine spun sleeves or (if you're lucky) Greater Fine spun sleeves,
Drop off Greater <type> elementals in Twilight seas (Luclin) You'll need at
least a partner, 1 melee as named and titled elementals can't be slowed but
some nice loot there for all if you are willing to put the time in (and the
farmers let you in)

Wrists - Another RMB (don't like all those minuses for 1 point of Wis) or a
Chipped Bone Bracer (ogres in WK)

Hands - Nothing really to suggest here, at 45 go for ES gaunts, no stats but
right click snare will save you a spell gem.

Fingers - Fine, Velium versions as upgrade but I still wear the plat
variety.

Chest -  I'd drop this if I were you, get a foremans tunic at least, no wt
+3 Wis/Str ac10 drops in Sol A off Goblin foreman but sells cheap nowadays
as well after that Shroud of Nature from Temple of Droga and when you get to
late forties look up the Earth Blessed Tunic Quest given out in Twilight
Seas, can be a PITA but someone with more patience than me could prolly do
it (need 1 last part and having no luck)

Back - Mammoth Hide Cloak off Goblin Alchemist in Permafrost...permafrost is
normally very quiet (ie empty) if you can log on UK playing times (early
hours for US) otherwise he's likely to be camped.

Waist - I wear belt of growth from Hydro (Named Ele in Twilight, his common
drop) AC8 +2 wis/str/int all saves as well as 10hp and mana. Not sure what
else to suggest (His rare drop, belt of Guardianship is better)

Legs - Same here, Kromrif Military leggings (Velious quest) should be
considered, achievable with an average guild behind you.

Feet - Wore wolf hide slippers (goblin scryer in permafrost) until I bought
my GEBs, ultimately you want to look at getting the bright yellow wellies,
prolly easier to make the plat to buy than to get on the spawn to loot them.
