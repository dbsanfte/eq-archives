You know, reading this, I couldn't help but think of something.

You were apparently willing to spend 40kpp on a forage bot.  Did it ever
occur to you that at typical bazaar prices, on my server at least, you could
have purchased 500 stacks of vegetables with that amount of cash?

I know, the immediate response is that you'll never be able to find 500
stacks of vegetables on sale in the bazaar at any one time.  Hey, you might
not be able to find more than 5-10 stacks at any one time.  But my response
to that would be whether you think it'll take less time to forage that much
with your druid.

Also, when did they change Mark of Retribution to no longer attribute the
damage done by it to the cleric who cast the spell?
