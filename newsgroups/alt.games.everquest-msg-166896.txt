Is there a web site with the ZEM for all zones?  The only ZEM listings I've seen
were actually just the change in ZEM that verant announced... and since we have
no idea what the original ZEM was, its not very informative.  75 ZEM times 125%
is different from 50 ZEM times 125% is different from 100 ZEM times 125%.

I think there's a good chance that Paladul Caverns has the highest ZEM in the
game...
