It was in an excerpt from a report from one of the market 
research companies in a game development magazine.  I tried
to find an online version, but couldn't - guess I have to
retract it until I can dig my magazines out of storage.

IIRC it basically indicated that people who had recently purchased
a system were more likely to buy games.  The notion was that
they had a) the disposable income and b) a desire to "show off"
the new hardware.
