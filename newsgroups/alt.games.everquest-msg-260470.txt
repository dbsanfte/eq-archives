I spent 53 through most of 55, 2-boxing the PoJ ZO.  Decent XP, not too risky, except when
that nutty Sralm Noramir adds onto a pull.  He's blessed with just enough DPS and HP to
make things interesting at 54 :->

But I've been away for 56.  Based on your advice, the Chanter and I returned to PoJ last
night and set up camp at the ZO.  The SoJs were conning high blue, as were most of the
"cell mobs".  But I was only seeing about .3% per high-blue kill, too slow for my taste.

I moved North, into the second jail area.  The SoJs seemed to hit harder, even though I
know they're all supposed to be L45.  After a couple kills, though, I aggro'd a mess o'
festering rats who proceeded to chew me to death.  LOM, the Chanter could only hold mezz
on a couple of the buggers.  So I eventually chose to eat the death while the Chanter ran
for his life.  I logged after getting the all-important clicky-cleric rez, vowing to
secure the camp from rats **before** moving on to the more interesting targets ;->

Best regards,
