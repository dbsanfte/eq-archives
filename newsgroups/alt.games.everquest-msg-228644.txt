I want to create a new high elf wizard.  My first stop was the Casters
Realm character creation guide.  They offered two main suggestions; an
INT-based approach (pour your 25 bonus points into INT) or a STA-based
approach (pour your 25 bonus points into STA).  I've noticed the STA-
based approach being suggested in this newsgroup for classes such as
shaman.  Does the STA-based approach make sense for INT-based casters
such as wizards?

I went to Magelo to see if I could determine the value of the STA-based
approach.  Pouring 25 bonus points into STA didn't seem to pay off very
well; a level 10 wizard with 100 stamina only has someting like 10 health
more than a level 10 wizard with 75 stamina.  At level 65, the difference
was 65 health (75 STA vs. 100 STA).

Unless the extra health from stamina starts scaling much better as STA
rises above 100, it seems like the STA-based approach isn't appropriate
for wizards.  Especially since the depth of the wizard mana pool is
extremely important; for example, a wizard needs a deep mana pool to solo
well.  If a wizard runs out of mana before the enemy is dead, the wizard
is dead.

Comments?  Suggestions?  Thanks.  :-)
