No, the XP bonus ranges from 6% extra for a duo (a 1000 XP mob gives
530 each instead of 500) up to 20% extra for a full group (a 1000 XP
mob gives 200 each instead of 166.)  A five-member group gets 14%
(a 1000 XP mob gives 228 each instead of 200.)   With that 1000 XP
mob, a five man group is getting 228 per kill or 28 more than a full
group.  For the XP bonus to make a difference, you need to kill about
15% more mobs in a full group, assuming the same level of mobs.

Presumably you wouldn't add someone who'd not help kill so you
supposedly have 20% more killing power in a full group than a
five man group would have, right?   (Actually, assuming the healer
doesn't contribute a full share to actual killing power means you have
maybe 25% more killing power.)   That means that you *should* be
able to kill 15% more mobs easily, meaning a full group is going to
earn more XP than a partial group.

Full groups give other benefits, though, such as the ability to deal with
higher-level mobs (a *huge* factor if you can do so w/o downtime)
and additional safety (dying doesn't help the XP bar go up.)  Those
are just as important -- if not more so -- than the XP bonus.

The other consideration is the way EQ splits XP.  It's not split per
member, but per level.  A five man group only gets the same XP
per member if each member is the same level.   The way you figure
out XP is by adding everyone's levels together.  Then each person
gets (their_level/total_levels) * (mob_XP * group_bonus.)  It's
important to keep that in mind.  Adding a higher-level person means
you get even less XP and you now have to kill even more to get past
the break-even point....
