I see.. Since I have played all the other games, that means that I don't
know squat about any of the other games (trying to follow the logic

BTW, I never played D2. Since it was almost a year late, I found something
else to bitch about.

I played and liked AC for 15 months. I played EQ for 3-4 months, and was
getting fed up with it after only a month or so.
