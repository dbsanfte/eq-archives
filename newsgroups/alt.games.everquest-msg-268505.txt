    Not on mine. They try from time to time, but they don't get wins.

    The BP is nice because there's a lack of alternatives. We average about 
one BP per clear, usually plate, but we've been lucky that way. By the way - 
last night, 30 person kill on VZ with 4 clerics and 1/3rd the raid having 
never killed VZ before, 27 person kill on CT with 4 clerics and half the 
raid having never killed CT before. It's easy to do with Time-flagged apps.

    ...then you're dealing with what we have to deal with. We've had 
warriors with Windspeeder as their haste, and that thing is a piercer to 
boot.

    That means knowing when the gimp mobs are due to pop, and we honestly 
don't have enough people to scout like that any more. It also means sitting 
in WoS waiting on respawn, which most of the guild just can't handle any 
more. We're either moving or killing, because if we sit still with nothing 
to do people start complaining. In a half-dozen kills on Hulcror we've seen 
that clicky once, btw.

    You mean the rare drop belt which our recruits can't get because they're 
incapable of beating that trial?

    Stats are meaningless. The mana savings of a slow stick in an XP group 
is massive.

> 2 hours: Inktu'ta

    Using our last times:

    1 hour in Qvic, 2 if Cyno OR Zoo is up.
    1 hour: clearing to Aneuks and killing.
    45 minutes: Champion, assuming Aneuks are dead.
    One hour to clear to Ixt 1 and kill.
    30-45 mins for ACM.
    45 minutes to clear to and kill second Ixt.
    30 mins for Zun, 1 hour if we get really unlucky on pet pop (usually 
we're lucky).

    This includes clear time (we don't clear when loot is being decided), 
and loot decision (5-10 minutes per mob). Our last Inktu'ta raid was over 
three hours long. With people logging early these days, we have sixish hours 
in a day - can't get enough to raid with earlier, can't retain people later. 
Qvic, Txevu, Qvic is about it for us.

    ***He is timelocked by the Australian guild, like pretty much anything 
they can kill.*** They won't rotate on anything because there's no reason 
for them to do so - stuff eventually ends up in their time zone no matter 
what we do, since you can't kill a mob the moment it pops, and then they 
lock it up for weeks at a time. Sometimes they slack and something slips 
through, but in general if they can kill it then it's never up. Lucky for us 
they haven't started getting serious about OoW yet.

    The characters are gone, accounts cancelled, characters deleted. There's 
nothing TO bot. We Need New Keys. Hell, we don't even have Champion keys 
right now.

> If Zun is rotated (along with qvic)

    Qvic isn't rotated. It was originally, but since the Aussies arrived in 
the zone there's been very little point. We stopped rotating M'shas when OoW 
came out, and it's now FFA.

    I counted the inevitable Jewel rot. ;-)

    Because we don't do that much in a night. Wanna know how we beat you to 
killing Zun? We threw ourselves at it, night after night, learning it when 
everyone else wasn't trying. We skip farming to do progress stuff all the 
time. Last night, when we killed CT, the three drops - legs, belt, cloak - 
all went to LC mains that were present at the raid. Hell, the legs would 
have upgraded me, as would have the Globe that dropped off VZ. Look at my 
Magelo, click on my mask, and cringe - and I'm well-geared by our standards.

> How can people blow their dkp/loot merit on txevu crap when Rift

    We killed Queen/King first on server, haven't gone back since. They 
aren't progress mobs, so we don't do them. The one group named drops are 
worse than Time drops, and we're mostly full on Time drops - at least in the 
slots that drop in Rifts.

> MPG

    We don't kill all the trials in a day or anything like that. At best we 
clear them all in three days, during which we do no other loot mobs other 
than WoS trash for spells. So we get very few drops from MPG, and the top 
points folks scoop them all because they're racking up points way faster 
than they can spend them. The only solution is to farm loot faster, so we 
can have some trickle down, but we don't farm nearly as much as I think we 
should. During GoD, we had a running joke that was prompted by a main tank 
saying that doing any mob three times was enough, then we should move on. 
It's the way our leadership thinks.

> Anguish is just as farmable and way better?

    Between x-loc'ing from wherever we were, getting everyone to run to 
Anguish from wherever they're bound, dealing with the inevitable moron 
training the cleric epic Girplan, etc. it takes us a half hour just to get 
in the zone. We do farm augs at the end of the day, but we don't even try to 
get the ones deeper in. We quit one night because the next aug mob was a 
30-45 minute clear for the force we had left, and we weren't going to "waste 
time" on getting one loot item when everyone could be getting signets, AA's 
etc. in that 45 minutes - even though most people just log at the end of 
raiding. You should see the problem with that, I see the problem with that, 
but as long as we have numbers issues which depress the officers that's what 
we'll be doing.

    No, not because of any agreement, more because of mutual antipathy. A 
lot of people in the three guilds just don't like one another, and the 
styles of the three guilds is sufficiently different that people who are 
happy in one guild are unlikely to be happy in another. Now, I am in the 
process of raiding one guild for recruits and taking away another guild's 
recruits, but the best players in each guild simply wouldn't join the 
others. They'd rather quit and play WoW.

    Remember how I said half of the people for our CT kill last night had 
never killed CT before? ;-) I'm not going down without a fight!

> Time is faster at supplying weaker more outdated gear quicker.

    Time is better at getting people to the point where they're not a 
liability on a raid. The alternatives you've listed drop weaker than Time 
gear, and require time to obtain that most of the people who need it most 
don't have.

    They're in the instances. Outdoors is all about simple fights for 
grinding XP, and since everyone can solo, the fights tend to be trivial. 
Lemme find the link....

     http://www.rpgforums.net/showthread.php?t=262922&page=1&pp=25 - you may 
need to register to read it. Describes one beta tester's exploration of 
Scholomance, a single group instance, and the quests associated with it. He 
lists all the strats they needed to handle things, from single mob strats 
down to named event strats. It sounds amazingly cool, and has all the 
complexity you'd want. And the atmosphere is amazing. Beneath the zone is an 
abandoned town, with two ghostly quest NPCs in it and lots of places where 
players get "people talking" text - the place feels haunted. After you 
complete one particular quest in the zone, you are given an item that allows 
you to see the truth - the town is *filled* with ghosts, and the "people 
talking" text was these ghosts walking around the town talking (can't be 
seen with see invis, only by doing the quest). That opens up more quests, 
and even allows access to ghost vendors that sell unique No Drop tradeskill 
recipes (you need a recipe in game to be able to craft in WoW). That sounds 
flat-out awesome, the sort of experience you want in a MMORPG.
