I'd take a careful look at Carpenter v United States before you make that 
claim.  In that case the Wall Street Journal had a similarly difficult 
position of proving how they were being damaged when staff writers were 
using their not-yet-published features to make money on the stock market 
based simply on the fact that the features would themselves affect the 
prices of the stocks they mentioned when published.  There was no monetary 
damage in that case.  The WSJ was no worse off financially because of the 
unauthorized use of their intellectual property, and any reputation or good 
will damage was speculative.

Here's a relevant quote:

"The confidential information was generated from the business, and the 
business had a right to decide how to use it prior to disclosing it to the 
public. Petitioners cannot successfully contend based on Associated Press 
that a scheme to defraud requires a monetary loss, such as giving the 
information to a competitor; it is sufficient that the Journal has been 
deprived of its right to exclusive use of the information, for exclusivity 
is an important aspect  of confidential business information and most 
private property for that matter."

I don't think the aspect of confidentiality of the WSJ's IP is material in 
the sense that it would have to be applied to other cases.   I think the 
same holding can apply to SOE's IP in Everquest, that it is their exclusive 
right to define to its licensees how its IP is to be used, such that they 
can prohibit IGE-type sales.  As I've said before in these threads, if 
there's nothing SOE can do in response to IGE's use of SOE's property, 
they've lost a certain amount of control over their IP.  They've been 
"damaged" thusly because they no longer have the exclusive right to 
determine the parameters of its use.  The court would have to say that SOE 
*can't* restrict that kind of use, and that tends to go against what the 
relevant caselaw suggests.  I mean, it *is* their intellectual property. 
You can't dispute that, can you?

Plus, I think you're too easily dismissing the idea that their good will and 
reputation has been damaged by IGE's activities.  Can you conclusively claim 
that IGE's activities haven't hurt the game?  That the widespread selling, 
farming and its attendant effects (players having access to content and 
items that they didn't earn ingame) hasn't done any harm to the reputation 
of Everquest?
