"Playing the game" is not sitting on a boat or running across large
empty zones. 

"Playing the game" (for me at least) is meeting new people, doing
quests, doing tradeskills, earning plat, upgrading gear, playing
reseller in the bazaar, and yes even gaining exp/levels while doing
the aforementioned things. Long travel times, get in the way of doing
the things that are "fun".

The whole point of playing EQ is to advance at something, and all
advancement in EQ is "numerical" (tradeskill skill-ups, class
skill-ups, levels, bank account, number of people on your friends
list, filling out your spellbook with research only spells, etc)

By your definition, players who have fun "regardless" should be
content to sit at their PC and stare at their character for hours
while in Trader mode.
