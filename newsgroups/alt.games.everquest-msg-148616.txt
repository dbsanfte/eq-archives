<quote>The practice of barging in and taking someone else's chance to deal a

Ok so this raises a question for me now twice I have been in kc and VSR has
been up and while shouting for some ppl to help have (I think) attracted the
attention of others who have come along and killed him (I rather stupidly
helped the first ones to see what was involved). So when does it actually
become kill stealing? I.E. In my case I am sat at kc ent shouting for names
to help and using the bazaar channel to ask for help too does this mean kill
stealing or do I have to be sat in front of VSR while shouting for the help
for it to be classed as kill stealing?
