I've been playing for a little over a year, and I've managed to get a
character to 60, and 2 more to the mid 50's, and I'm not burnt out yet.  I
don't go to the Warrens because none of my characters are of non-trivial
level, and I don't have any more room on my account to create a newbie just
to explore a new zone, so I effectively get locked out of any new content
in there.  And no, I won't be starting a new character on a new server,
because starting out naked with a guild tunic and rusty weapon isn't my cup
of tea.  I've been through that hell once, and once was enough for me.  I'm
not looking to quit EQ, but if they present m with a new expansion in which
I don't have access to half the content, chances are I'll move on if
something better comes along, and those who I associate with have the same
feeling.  At the very least, if the TCC is in place, have the mobs not aggro
me if they're too weak to drop loot for me.
