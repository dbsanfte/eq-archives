Actually, no.  With BoR and my Orb of Thunderous Spirits, SL is only
half-a-second slower than SR.  So I use SL almost exclusively.  And yes, I
know that half-a-second can make a difference upon rare occasion.  I think
the fact that SL heals for significantly more hitpoints outweighs the
half-a-second difference in the casting time.

I dusted off SR just for Xegony, since people were all over the place while
we were trying to position ourselves.  The 300 range on SR proved to be very
helpful.  It was really brought to light how long it had been since I'd cast
the spell when I couldn't find it in the right-click list of spells... I
checked and double-checked everything under "Heals" and couldn't find it and
almost convinced myself that I'd never actually scribed SR until I found it
under "Quick Heals".  =)

:D  :D  :D   Guilty as charged.

Then you go to PoM!

BTW, I keep meaning to share with you, James... you were the topic of
discussion one day in our guildchat.  Someone commented, "Man, Monual, your
friend from LC sure ripped CiH a new one!"  This was followed by a chorus of
agreement from a lot of our members.  So your brief foray into our server's
message board did not go unnoticed.  =)

I've been tempted at times to contribute to some Quellios threads... the
recent one about Dadorf annoys me, especially given Dadorf's condescending
replies.  I've restrained myself only because I know I'll get counterflamed
pretty good, and not without justfication, either.  ^_^
