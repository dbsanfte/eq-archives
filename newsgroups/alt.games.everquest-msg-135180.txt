OpenGL would be far better for all EQ users than Direct3D is, not just 
Linux players.

However, simply providing OpenGL as an alternative API would not mean EQ 
  would run under Linux. This is mostly because the EQ patcher is built 
on IE, and because MS wants to use IE to crush the use of Linux as a 
desktop OS, you won't be seeing IE on Linux until it snows in hell.

If only VI would use a different platform for their patcher... if only.
