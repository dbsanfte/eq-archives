The best place I've found for druid/ranger hunting in the 30's is
Dawnshroud, because very litle aggros you there: lightcrawlers, which can be
avoided; mushrooms, which have set spawn places, just listen for train
shouts, and rockhoppers, which are also trained-only. I can't remember if
the non-Sambata sort or Tribals will aggro you until you start in on them,
but again, they have their areas that they stick to, so your only read
difficulty is the lightcrawlers.
