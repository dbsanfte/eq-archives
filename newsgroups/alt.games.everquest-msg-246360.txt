I used MB for the equipment upgrade info, but that seemed frozen after
yantis bought it out; might be a coincidence. I recall playing in Paw with a
monk only group, that's to give you an idea of how popular they were at one
stage. People were saying they were "easily twinkable". I was playing one as
my main and had terrible envy of the flowing black silk sash, I recall. Now
it's the Legendary one that makes me sigh :*)

Now I have a 55 monk, still struggling along. When I play as my 57 druid, I
get groups. They may already have a druid, they take me. When I play as my
monk, I don't get groups.

I 2 box my monk because he doesn't get played otherwise. I dream of being
able to get my druid up to the point of having enough money making to be
able to afford ornate armour for the monk, to hopefully make him more
attractive for groups, but the fact is, I never get a tell on my monk asking
him if he's looking for groups, where as my shaman is flooded if I don't go
anon.

Final note: I really like the sit regen changes. My combo works quite nicely
fighting rockhoppers, and i rarely need to heal. If only there was more than
one cave of hoppers in DSP, or more beasties dropping items for tailoring
skillups. Why not make mobs in GoD drop A_Fur_Blanket, which can be combined
to A_Nice_Hat at a 242 triv. The mob might be level 65 and you can still bet
it would be farmed out 24/7...
