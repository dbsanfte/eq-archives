You know, thats another good question.  I know that most of you are saying, 
"Hey its beta, there is supposed to be lag", and to a certain degree that is 
true.  However, at this point in the applications life (EQ II) the lag 
should not be to the extent it is.  There are also some very tell tale 
indicators in how Sony is handling this problem that can give us some very 
interesting insight.

Lag. In every game, there is what is called a 'game loop'.  A 'game loop' is 
a set of tasks that are performed over and over again at a rate of 30 frames 
per second (FPS).  There are a zillion tasks to be performed in this small 
time slice but we have to look at this through the eyes of the computer, and 
although faster, still has its limitations.

One of the tasks is drawing the screen.  All the stuff you see on the screen 
is drawn on what is called a 'back buffer'.  Once the drawing is done, the 
'back buffer' is sent to the display and voila, you have a world.  If you 
have a lot of stuff to draw, it takes longer to draw.  If it takes longer to 
draw, then instead of 30 FPS you get 25.  If you have a high level of 
detail, it takes longer to draw.  You might drop to 20, or 15 FPS.  This is 
why when in EQ and you are in a raid you get lag.  So many objects, so 
little time.

Now why is this important in EQ II?  In Antonica, if you are standing, 
looking off into the distance, at nothing, but you have a high level of 
detail and you try and turn, you get lag that drops to 2-3 FPS.  We should 
have never seen that.  As a testing developer one of your tests would be to 
do exactly that.  Stand still, look at nothing, and try to turn.  The 
hardware you use would be what your recommended requirement is, not your 
minimum. We have two computers here that FAR exceed the recommended 
requirement and I can still recreate that scenario in Antonica. Today.  That 
my friends is a basic programming problem and an internal graphics engine 
design flaw.  If as a developer I get lag under the scenario I have 
described, no beta.  On the boards the developers say that the lag is caused 
by memory leaks.  This is possible.  But to have that many leaks to cause 
that kind of lag has got to be the some of the poorest programming I have 
ever heard of.

How is Sony handling it?  They have tuned the options menu now to where they 
tell you if they think you are exceeding you particular systems 
capabilities.  So, I followed there recommendations.  I set everything as 
high as Sony would let me on a very high end machine (P4 3.0 GHZ 2 GB RAM, 
6800 Nvidia graphics adapter yada yada).  They will tell you that 'future' 
machines and technology will handle these wonderful graphics.  Well, if the 
machines come from the future then where did the screen grabs come from? 
Must be a time traveling department at Sony.

Okay, well, maybe its my communications.  I have a business class Road 
Runner account. so, I don't think that is a problem.  Also, although 
communications plays a roll in lag, it is minimal. The database and packet 
design should be such that the data transferred is minimal and the front end 
takes care of most of the lag burden.  If it is communications then this is 
really a problem because they have had a five year leg up with EQ and 
commincation packet processing.  They already know what can and can't be 
done.  If they have messed with the comminications then they are fools.

What are Sonys options?  Cut the Level Of Detail (LOD) down so we can play 
the game.  Thats fine with me.  Who cares, just so I can play.  What I don't 
like are the screen shots they are purporting to be in game grabs.  Well... 
they may be in game grabs, but nobody is moving.

Once again, Sony is trying to kludge this together and hopefully blow it by 
the end user, but this time its different.  Everybody and their brother has 
an MMOG.  Its not like five years ago.  We will just find one we like and 
runs as advertised and play that.
