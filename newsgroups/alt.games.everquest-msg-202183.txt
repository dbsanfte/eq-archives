    It is an exploit. Players have been given official warnings for using
such kiting spots before, like in Skyfire and Dalnir. You can't have as your
strategy fearing something into a wall.

    Now, if it happens as a consequence of something else legitimate then
it's a bit of a grey area. For example, with the new pathing changes mobs
pulled to zone-in in CoD path into the corner and run into the wall when
they get low health. Zone-in is a logical spot to pull mobs, and you can't
do anything other than leave zone-in to stop this behaviour, so I doubt a GM
observing it would care. The same thing happened with groups at zone-in in
Dalnir, and it was considered OK.

    Yes.

    At least you felt horrible. Most people were shameless about using that
corner.
