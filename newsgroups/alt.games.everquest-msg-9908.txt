Ok, so my Troll SK is not about to replace the cleric, and yes not even the
shammy or druid for that matter.

Ogre Warrior and I were fighting giants in the fort in WW, waiting for a
druid to make his way over on the boat to Kunark.  Downtime was a bit bad,
but we could do 3 or 4 giants before we needed the rest.  I decided to use
my little used spell Dark Empathy.  This spell allows me to transfer 30hp
from myself to another PC.  I would heal up the warrior to a bub or so above
me, then I could use the troll regen to catch up.  Cut our downtime in half.

Most of what I read about this spell says to use it in emergencies, like if
someone is DOTTED and dying, or unconscious, but it was pretty cool to use
it in an alternate way and have it effective.

BTW: druid died shortly after boat landed but didn't bind in Kunark  :-(...
so I played the healer most of the night.

I can imagine necros could have similar uses for this spell too.
