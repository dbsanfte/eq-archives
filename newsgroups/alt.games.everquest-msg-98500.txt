Well, I turned 40 a couple of months ago. Was playing D & D and A D & D (plus
being a Dungeon Master) in the late 70's and early 80's. I dreamed of the day
when computers could handle all the grunt work of playing pen and paper games.
EQ, for me, is definitely good in that regard. :)

Of course, I played one of the first commercial multi-user-dungeon games before
the Internet was really the internet through Sierra On-Line (very early 1990's).
It was kind of hokie, but kind of fun.

I definitely like the interaction between players on EQ, that for me is the
thing that makes it the most interesting and fun!

Regards,

Fredrick
