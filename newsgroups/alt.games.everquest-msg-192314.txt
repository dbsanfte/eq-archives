None of the classes was meant as a true soloclass, but in all the tradeoffs
some have better soloabilities than others but even druids and necros get
more and more send towards grouping. Most of new spells are better to be
cast on others than on the player him/herself. Or if mob aimed more usefull
for other party members. Like lower atk and ac on mobs. (druids should
prevent getting hit in the 1st place) don't be surprised if more nerfs and
additions will encourage (force?) the supposed soloclasses even further to
group.
