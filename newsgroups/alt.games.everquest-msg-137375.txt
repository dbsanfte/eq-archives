If it exists then why are you unable to quote it?  Stop the babbling
and provide this policy you say exsist!

Quoting from a past message you would rather forget:

YOU

That was my comment on policies of the sort you claim exists with
BB-BS of America Inc.  The existance of such a policy, if there is one
in this case, in no way invalidates my position.

IF you want me to specifically discuss a policy you say BB-BS of
America Inc. has, then YOU need to produce that policy.  I won't
comment on your flights of fancy!

Considering you have failed to back up your "special rights" claim,
you'll wait a long time!


Now, the issues you have dodged so far:

1) You can no longer justify your stupid claim that " open
homosexuality hasn't been an issue until the last 20 years or so" and
therefore dropped the topic like a hot potato, and

2) You made a statement that the first article you linked to somehow
proved that some imaginary "homosexual lifestyle" was being forced on
"everyone".  I made nine statements to the contrary, you had no
rebuttal for any of them.  You then jettisoned that angle to link to a
second news article.

3) You ignored my challenge to prove your statement that I was forcing
my so-called homosexual lifestyle on anyone.   YOUR words: " All
anyone has seen is your militant attitude about forcing your lifestyle
on everyone else... "

4) You are failing to provide this policy you say Big Brothers-Big
Sisters of America Inc. has.  If such a policy exists, it should be
easy for you to provide the exact text and/or a link.   Then you need
to show how the existence of such would somehow invalidate what you
imagine my position to be.
