You are right. The fact that the information I posted was hours of date, and
reflected on http://www.monkly-business.com/ as posted on
http://www.monkly-business.com/ as Saturday, October 19, 2002, and it is now
sunday, and I hadn't checked to see if this had changed in the hours since I
had written the post and the time it was posted (I compose offline, so sue
me) is completely unforgivable, and I just wish I and the makers of
monkly-business were as well informed, omniscient and polite as you are.

I will indeed try to keep up with the news. I expect you to correct every
thing I post with the same, gentle and understanding post, as you have so
humbly acknowledged my fallibility.
