  He was just kind of sitting there, staring at the robin and apparently 
waiting for it to move so he could start batting it around. My wife drove 
him from the room, and I scooped up the bird in the small (and 
fortunately empty at the time) trash can we keep in the computer room. 
My wife locked the cat in the bedroom, and I released the robin out back. 
Teamwork! =)
