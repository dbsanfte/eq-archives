Aye I agree, something like that would be great.  I was gearing this more
towards lower levels though, harder for them as their choice of what to
kill is a bit lower :)

In a real hunt you give clues for everything. (i.e)

In a land where lava burns the ground,
that is where this item will be found.
Its from the skin of a beast you must take,
but beware of the bite of this fiery drake.
