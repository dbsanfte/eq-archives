I think he's saying it's a bad idea because there isn't a lot of high-level
farming of low-level zones going on.

It's a solution to a problem that doesn't exist.

The only consistently farmed camp I can think of is the ancient crocodile in
Upper Guk, and that's because there aren't any other +INT sleeves attainable
in the game before level 45 or so.

It doesn't harm the level-appropriate players at all.

But it does penalize me and other high-level players for getting to said
high level, especially when they add the "feature" long after the level was
attained.

Now let me ask you: how does this HELP the level-appropriate players, given
that there is negligable high-level camping going on?
