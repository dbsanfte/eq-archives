Quite simple.  A government will be selected allowed to govern.

I have forgotten the names of the chaps proposed for the task already.
I will see if I can dig it up.  Oh, yes, he's an oilman.   A chum of
Bush Snr by some co-incidence.

After the Kuwait disaster last time - in which the princes were
allowed to return back to power if they promised to hold democratic
elections and then didn't.  The US is not going to make the same
mistake twice.  They will want they boys at the top pulling the
strings in the background.

It may well be an Iraqi's face on the coins in the future but you
won't see the strings...
