The problem with ground spawns is that there is a finite number of yew
leaves that can be spawned at once, the leaves can spawn on top of trees or
under rocks or in otherwise inaccessable places, and the leaves will not
respawn until someone picks one up.

So what happens is that the leaves that can be picked up get picked up. 
Their replacements have a chance of respawning someplace inaccessable.  So
as time goes on, more and more of the leaves wind up in places that people
can't get to.  Eventually, there may be several dozen yew leaves in the
zone, but they're all in places where they can't get picked up.
