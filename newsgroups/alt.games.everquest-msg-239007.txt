Of course it's worth it.

The stats have got little to do with it. It's the *epic*. Getting stuff
like this is why we play the game. Unless you are one of those people
who treat the game like a competition to get the highest score and think
of it as work rather than fun. What else can you do in the game that
will give you such a sense of achievement?
