As a 7 day newbie I have tried various races and classes, Barbarian
Shaman, Wood Elf Ranger, Wood Elf Druid, High Elf Paladin and found
at the start anyway they  seemed to have very different sorts of times
of it.
Paladin seemed to do best of all in getting past the being in danger
of being killed by a couple of giant drone wasps ganging up and swats
orc paws at lvl 3 no problem while my poor Druid still has to be very
careful.   Something to do with the AC and that bloody club I suppose.
