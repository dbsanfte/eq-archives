you wouldn't happen to be on FV, would you?  if so, i can help you find it.

it is a little difficult to find at first.  when i first started, i had to
go back and forth about 5 times before i got the route memorized.  now it
has become sort of my default place to go.  sometimes when i want to go to
the bank or buy suplies for my tradeskills i have to pay close attention to
what i'm doing, or else i end up back at the necro guild...
