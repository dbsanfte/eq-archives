Now think about what you just wrote from a different perspective.
If all that matters is what happened on "THIS current raid" you
are giving rewards to the "sunshine" players.  The folks who come
only to raids where gear drops that they might use.  And you are
punishing the reliable players (reliable as in they're there to
help their guildmates take down the mobs that give them loot, like
that reliable tank who's always ready to MA when you're after a
mob that drops caster gear, for example).  Your idea is unworkable
simply because it is a big bright cheery invitation to do exactly
what those selfish melees demanding NBG at Frenzy and logging when
the group went to ArchMage instead did.  A points system will give
you a shot at loot in proportion to your raiding participation if
it is properly implemented.  A /random (especially if it tries to
be NBG) will screw the regulars so thoroughly that they'll likely
quit your guild and go somethere that their efforts are actually
appreciated.
