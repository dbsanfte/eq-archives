First of all, make sure you keep a 2HS in your inventory and keep the
skill up. Yes, more often you'll be using dual 1HS weapons, but the time
will come, on raids, etc. when you are not MA and you'll want to pull
out the big blade and start hacking.

There are some nice crystallized blades which warriors can use that drop
in CC. You might find one for sale in your price range once you sell the
BABS, but you may want to consider just haning on to the BABS. It's a
nice weapon (though far from ubertwink material.) I still use one at
level 51. Sadly, 200 plat isn't a lot of money to get a signigicant
upgrade in your 1HS slot. Doesn't sound like you're a twink (neither was
I) and I dual weilded langesax well into my 20's. Dont' worry about it
too much. Concentrate on getting your AC as high as possible.
