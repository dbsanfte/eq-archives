Hehehe. 

And lets be realistic about the size of the development/CS team.

450,000 accounts x 2 dollars/mo = $900,000/mo increased revenues. per 
MONTH.

Even a team of 200 would EACH have to get a raise of over $4,000 per 
MONTH to soak up that kind of revenue. Wages haven't gone up *that* much 
in the last 6 years.

Nevermind that we haven't accounted for the falling costs of bandwidth 
and hardware.

Plus I'm pretty sure the team is less than 200 people. Much less. I'd be 
very surprised if its even one third that.

They have figured they can make more money at 14.95. That is the only 
reason they raised it. I'm fine with that.

I just don't care to be lied to about "needing to offset increasing 
costs".
