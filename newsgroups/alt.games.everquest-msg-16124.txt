That would be me.  Even at the height of Doroteas UO/PK career she spent more
time fighting d00ds that killing innocents.

Eventually I came to realize that most PKs were stupid children who only wanted
to back shoot and gang bang.  Most PKs will run from an even fight.  If you go
to a PK website you will find that they even admit it.

The number of PKs who want a fair fight is very small, which is why I supported
the changes and restrictions to PKs that were introduced to UO.
