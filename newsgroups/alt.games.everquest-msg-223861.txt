I feel bad having one of those cleavers while I have two friends who would
love it and I never use it...but they just weren't with me at the time. :(

I don't pay much attention to 1-handed weapons these days, but is it

Y'know...I've never gone in any further than Heili.  What are the
different types of mobs I would meet beyond the kobolds?  Do they get
steadily tougher?  Seems like a good old-fashioned crawl would be in order
once everyone has their requisite rings and cleavers.
