The other warrior in my party switched to his dual-Yaks last night and was 
getting 1-4 procs per mob.  His dex is lower than mine, probably 125 or so 
buffed.

What do you have in your range slot?  I carry a beetle stinger that I use 
now and then for piercing, but I normally have it in my range slot when I'm 
not pulling with a bow.  I don't know what is good for range slot for a 
warrior, so I just use this.  I know it adds Dex and Wis, and may add some 
Agi, too.

After I dinged 38, I put my Runebladed Sword of Night in my primary, and a 
Dwarven Sap in my secondary, swapping in my shield to bash whenever the 
button popped up.  The 176 point DD on that Blade is a pretty hefty taunt.  
It was proc'ing at least one time per mob, sometimes 2, and once it did 3.

My warrior's Dex last night was 137 ( it's normally 107 w/o buffs ) and 
after 3 yellows, I only got 2 skill-ups on my melee skills - and one of 
them was an off-hand skillup.  I'm getting really frustrated at this, 
because I'm working on everything but 2HB.  My skills used to fly in the 
mid-20s.  I even have another warrior in my normal group who will tank 
while I work on skills and I still can't seem to get them to go up, 
anymore.  In level 36, I had -maybe- 5 total melee skill-ups.  I have some 
pretty fast weapons, too, so that isn't the problem.  The other warrior 
started having skill-up problems the same night I did.  I know it's not a 
nerf, but it's really pissing us off.

I realized last night that I had banded in my face and back slot.  DOH!  
Gotta get that corrected, ASAP.
