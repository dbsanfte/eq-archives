O-kay... How about this classification:

http://www.valhs.org/history/articles/mythology/myths/text/loki.htm

Some choice quotes from that page:

-> He is a trickster, a shape-changer, and the master of lies
and deceit.

Yup, trickster all right. So far so good. Master of lies and
deceit, though? Hmm...

-> At first, he was a prankster, not to be trusted, but helpful
on many occasions, such as in the story of rebuilding the walls
of �sgar�.
   ^^^^^^
   That should read Asgard with some funny old Norse characters,
   in case it doesn't come through right.

This sounds about right too...

-> Later, he became spiteful and malevolent, such as when he
cuts Sif's hair.

Sound like merry pranks to you? But wait, there's more!

-> Ultimately, Loki caused the death of Baldr, wisest of the gods.

My, that sure was fun! They don't make practical jokes like that
anymore, more's the pity...

OK, so I guess we both were right, if you thought of young Loki
and I thought of the older version. Call it a draw?

Rune, who cut a girl's braid in first grade, and is still
deeply ashamed of it. I didn't kill no god, though... Yet!
