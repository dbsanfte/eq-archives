Yups, 57...

Though I have an OK HP/AC with my gimp stuff, I am sort of patchy 
when it comes to equipment as I dont raid any more and have to 
get things in bazaar or buy them off of friends...
<http://everquest.allakhazam.com/profile.html?404218>
I buff up ok, and do a fair amount of soloing things for stuff I 
can sell in bazaar [ though I also fish for cobalt cod to make 
oil, and valorian discus and nighmare chiclids for the fishing 
rod quest, and the iceclad fish for the ring quest] and I do 
LDoNs and groups for xp. [OK, I will confess to an occasional 
raid for epic goodies, or quests for friends=)]
