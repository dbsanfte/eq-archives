Well, as somebody else suggested a few days ago: I camp bandits in the
karanas.
Last night I helped a guy out with bandages, damshields and killing the mobs
whenever he did a /yell. The tradeoff was that I got all the bandit sashes
that were dropped.

Had 3 hours of fun (-Can I take that willo? ; -dunno, try. ; *miss* *miss*
; -this might be tough ; *add* *add* *add* ; -aaaargh, get them off me! get
them off me! ; *boom* *boom* *boom* *boom*; -stop running like a pansy and
come back here!), 50 sashes, helped a fellow adventurer and as a bonus I
even got a bit of exp. 50 sashes equals 100 to 120 pp or so, might be more.
My char is lvl 30, but gets half a blue bub for every 30 or so bandit sashes
he turns in (note: this is a HELL level).

I think I will send all of my alts to this place when they get to a decent
level (none above 14 at the moment).

As a related question: Does anyone know what level the chief ogre is at the
ogre shrine in WK? All the normals con green, the shaman blue, but the chief
is a red with a blue pet. I'm really wondering if I could take him if I had
a partner around my level.
