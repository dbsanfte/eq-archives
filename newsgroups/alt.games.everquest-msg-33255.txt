Too much for my brain.  But I got the part about it getting better as I
level.

Should I do that even at the expense of STR?  I wouldn't be able to carry
anything.  Most of the magic I do: snare, root, & flame lick don't use much
mana.  I've never gone oom in a fight.  I rarely use burst of flame and
lightning as they either get resisted or just don't do much damage.  My
buffs last a looong time.

Some updates since I actually went into the game and checked:

I'm not wearing +2 STA earrings, I'm wearing +2 AGI earrings for a total of
+4 AGI.
I am wearing +2 STR rings, total +4 STR.

The belt is AC3 +2 STR and STA, not +3 on the stats.

My sword is DMG 7, DLY 26.  I think a very nice sword.
The shield is AC8, not 7.

My base stats are:
  STR 85
  STA 90
  AGI 100
  DEX 85
  WIS 65
  INT 75
  CHA 75

Just a note, I think at the same level my druid would kick my ranger's butt.
My druid can't take quite as much damage (but close) but with DoTs and DDs
can deal out major damage much faster.  I'm hoping that changes when I get
dual wield and double attack.  I've heard warriors start doing more dmage
per hit when they hit 20 or something.  Does the same apply to rangers?

Thanks,

Lewis
