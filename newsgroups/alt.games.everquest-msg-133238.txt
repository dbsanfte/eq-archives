Anyone have any advice for getting velious textures to work with the Luclin
Models?
I have this setting in eqclient.ini; LoadVeliousArmorsWithLuclin=TRUE and
all armors 17-23 set to TRUE.
My barbed ringmail, ry'gorr coif, arms, gaunts are all bugged. No graphic
for coif. Partial graphic for others. I switch to FALSE and they look like
regular chainmail.
I have uninstalled all of eq, reinstalled all of eq, re-run patch,
downloaded all new textures, but I am still bugged.
Emailed tech support, tried what they suggested, emailed again, no reply as
yet.

PS. When I bought the coif and put it on, the player who sold it to me said
it looked good. I see no graphic for rygorr coif.

BTW if anyone has a screenshot of what rygorr looks like on a wood elf with
the SoL models, and barbed ringmail, please email it to me.

Thx.
