Dozens, at best; after all, I'm introverted and somewhat antisocial.

Still, I think this bears out my point: if you only knew them "by
sight", you probably didn't know them well enough to discuss with them
whether or not they were addicted to AD&D, and whether or not it was
affecting their grades.

I just can't believe you spoke to HUNDREDS of people about their
addictions and if AD&D was affecting their grades.  Sorry, but I still
think you're exaggerating.
