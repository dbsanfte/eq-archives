I just use the standard drivers for my Logitech, and it works peachy. The
newest Logitech drivers are supposed to drop into 'standard mode' when they
detect something that looks like a game loading, which unfortunately
disables all the extra buttons and switches and shovels and rakes and
implements of destruction on the fancy Logitech mouse. The only reason I
ever use the Logitech drivers myself is for the Force Feedback part of my
mouse (I don't have enough force feedback in my life :) but that doesn't
work with eq anyway.
