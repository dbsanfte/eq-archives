Hi,

getting them together, just take a switch ( or hub ) with non-crossed lines.
Then give IPs to each computer ( under Win98 this was necessary too ). It�s
important, that your 2000er computer has the same subnetmask (
255.255.255.0 ) and the same Workgroup ( normally Mshome ). Now you just
have to built an account ( login-name on 98 or computername ) under 2000
that the 98er are able to access the computer. That�s all. You should be
able to see the other computers in your network ( attention : you have to
enable filesharing under 2000 too ).

For access to the internet over one computer, just use free Proxy-Servers
like Winproxy light ect.

I hope I could help you

Christian
