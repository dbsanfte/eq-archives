Copied from my post on the Druid's Grove.

All the old quest npcs are in the new skyshrine but relocated, most are in
the area between the pool room (where you zone in from CS) and the big room
with puddles and the stairs.

The bank is now in the room next to the bakers (who are still there).

The crystal spiders for the ring of the chameleon quest are apparently gone.

The Armor Quest NPCs are in the room immediately to your left when you come
out of the maze. (yay!)

Eldriaks Fe'Dhar, Supreme Laochsmith Psorinn, Ralgynn, and some other guy
that I think is for an old quest but I forget the name, are in the room
right before what used to be the armor quest room.

At the moment mobs that are supposed to have the Racnar/Raptor graphic are
showing up as naked human men, as are the Chromodrac/shimmering drakes, and
the 4 Crusaders of Veeshan (who are apparently dragons).

Everything past the maze can randomly see invis (seems about 1/10 actually
do, even the crusaders may not see invis), not sure about before it, I would
expect nothing between WL and CS to see, but not verified (though only about
8 mobs between the 2 zones, and the WL zone in is still safe if you're kos
and visible, CS zone in is NOT safe, you land right on top of 2 drakes and a
golem basically)

Only new text I found came from the Crusaders, red to 60, show up as naked
human men, but are apparently supposed to be dragons, judging by them
floating in midair and the emote text.

[Tue Nov 19 21:26:55 2002] You say, 'Hail, Grendish the Crusader'
[Tue Nov 19 21:26:56 2002] Grendish the Crusader says ''Greetings. You
address Crusader Grendish, keeper of mindful discipline and the spiritual
ties of our manifestations upon this world. I can sense as clear as the
warmth of Ro's touch upon our scales that honor washes through the fabric of
your being -- honor that has been displayed and proven countless times over
in your loyalty to the Claws of Veeshan. But something obstructs purity in
you -- your motives are clearer still. All of your kind that have come
before us believe we to be as our brethren -- at ease with our stations and
at a loss of judgment toward those whom have proven worthy of our
recognition and knowledge. Know that the Crusaders do not regard you or your
kind to be paralleled in existence unto us -- a regard that the recent,
ignorant and disregarding [actions] of your kind has justly and firmly
instated within us.''
[Tue Nov 19 21:26:59 2002] You say, 'what actions'
[Tue Nov 19 21:26:59 2002] Grendish the Crusader says ''Kerafyrm, the
Sleeper, has been awoken. For centuries the Claws of Veeshan have maintained
the prismatic threat's imprisonment, an act that was not achieved without
much sacrifice and loss, but now all seems to have been destroyed and left
as a struggle that ended in vain. The Sleeper is free and his power grows
with every passing moment -- a threat that has descended upon the steel of
second generation warriors. You have condemned yourself, as you have since
the dawn of your creation, but your actions guided by shallow lusts for
power and fame within your fledgling insignificance has spilled into the
ancient world that cradles your very existence. It is you who have ushered
us into being as we are now -- the apprentices we are no longer and as the
[Crusaders of Veeshan] we stand before and shall either [command or
disregard you].''
[Tue Nov 19 21:27:07 2002] You say, 'what crusaders of veeshan'
[Tue Nov 19 21:27:07 2002] Grendish the Crusader says ''When the warders
were first charged with the duty of holding the captured Kerafyrm in
enchanted stases, they were ordered by the elder council to mate with
dragons whose elemental influence mirrored their own. From these unions
would be born the apprentices -- dragons whom would be dedicated from birth
to the maintenance and imprisonment of the darkest threat to descend upon
this entire plane of being. Inevitably, the council did not foresee the
release of Kerafyrm by the actions of the second generation -- for it was
their foolhardy nature to underestimate and ignore the true depths of your
seemingly insignificant gluttonous lusts within your fallible existence.
When the Sleeper took flight, the apprentices became the Crusaders out of
necessity for the unforeseen present. Where our predecessors were of the
passive duty to maintain Kerafyrm's imprisoned slumber, the Crusaders must
be of aggressive natures to pursue and eliminate his threat once more. But
what has been [unleashed] is far more than a prismati'

This was all I could get out of him (no response to last line).

[Tue Nov 19 21:29:45 2002] You say, 'Hail, Susarrak the Crusader'
[Tue Nov 19 21:29:45 2002] Susarrak the Crusader extends his long neck and
lowers his maw downward to look upon you. Suddenly, a hushed and beautiful
voice whispers with a powerful dominion in your thoughts, 'You stand before
Susarrak, Crusader of Veeshan and keeper of all that is of the arcane and
faith within our order. I sense the loyalty you bear toward the children of
scale is strong still. However, the siren voice that has called you to us is
still a whisper upon your mind, and it is a song of curiosity and greed.
Since the dawn of your creation, all of your kind has proven that without
tangible reward, you would otherwise slay us. But do not think we fault you
for merely this -- such shallow lusts have come to be expected from your
kind. However, the [champions] are not as the others of Veeshan's brood and
your past deeds shall [not bear fruitful] in your dealings with us. '

[Tue Nov 19 21:29:50 2002] You say, 'what champions'
[Tue Nov 19 21:30:02 2002] You say, 'what shall not bear fruitful'
[Tue Nov 19 21:30:16 2002] You say, 'what champions shall not bear fruitful'

No responses from him other than hails it seems.

[Tue Nov 19 21:31:57 2002] You say, 'Hail, Charayan the Crusader'
[Tue Nov 19 21:31:57 2002] Charayan the Crusader says ''You stand before
Charayan, Crusader of Veeshan. I am the talon that justly strikes down our
enemies and shall fulfill our destiny in the trials of blood and vengeance.
I sense that the loyalty you bear toward the children of scale is strong but
the siren voice that has called you to us is still a whisper upon your mind,
and it is a song of curiosity and greed that fuels you yet. Since the dawn
of your creation, all of your kind has proven that without tangible reward
to do otherwise, your blades would be aimed for our hearts. But do not think
we fault you for merely this -- such shallow lusts have become a definition
of your kind, and we do not bear you ill will for it. However, the
[champions] are not as the others of Veeshan's brood and your past deeds
shall [not bear fruitful] in your dealings with us. ''
[Tue Nov 19 21:35:22 2002] You say, 'what champions'
[Tue Nov 19 21:35:22 2002] Charayan the Crusader rears upon her hind legs
and extends her wings once more in a glorious display, 'The Crusaders of
Veeshan are four champions of dragon kind who have dedicated their very
lives to the restoration of Kerafyrm's slumber and undoing that which your
kind has so ignorantly threatened this world with. Fate has given room for
nothing short of this declaration and the recent past has demanded our
attention and duty to be thus. Your kind, the second generation, has
carelessly shifted the destiny of all upon this world and it is your
ignorant and lustful actions that have forced us into existence as we are
now. Kerafyrm, the Sleeper, was well guarded for all these years not without
dire justification -- he cannot be destroyed by means conceivable by dragon
or second generation alike. We are those whose existence is to combat this
shadow and [keep it at bay], despite all costs and with all sacrifice.'

At this point he (err, she) ran off a little ways.

[Tue Nov 19 21:40:19 2002] You say, 'how do you keep it at bay'
[Tue Nov 19 21:40:19 2002] Charayan the Crusader says ''When Kerafyrm was
first recognized as a dire threat to this world, the four Warders were
chosen. The elders of the council knew that time's grace upon us was thin
and that the warders must be recognized as a temporary means of subduing
this threat. Before the great war that would yield Kerafyrm's incarceration,
the warders were instructed to mate with four dragons of pure elements as
their. The offspring of these unions would be trained for the undivided
purpose of fulfilling their predecessors' duties when their fate would
inevitably dawn. However, your kind have forced the apprentices into a [new
role], one that we had not anticipated, but such was our mistake to
overestimate and consider your kind the ability to rise above your debased
natures and shallow existence.''
[Tue Nov 19 21:40:30 2002] You say, 'what new role'
[Tue Nov 19 21:40:30 2002] Charayan the Crusader says ''When Kerafyrm was
awoken, the apprentices were called by the council to prepare for the hunt
and his recapture. The apprentices were not as agreeable to the council's
plan as they had anticipated and the Crusaders were born of our own accord.
For months the deliberations and cordial arguments raged, but all that would
eventually come would be the unspoken disapproval of the council and the
apprentices' self-imposed adoption of a new and more necessary duty. We have
come to Skyshrine to fulfill our purpose, but those passing months ushered
in an unseen darkness that the Crusaders had feared from the first movement
of Kerafyrm's eye -- the [ancients] returned.''
[Tue Nov 19 21:40:35 2002] You say, 'what ancients'
[Tue Nov 19 21:40:51 2002] You say, 'when did the ancients return'
[Tue Nov 19 21:40:55 2002] You say, 'where are the ancients'
[Tue Nov 19 21:40:58 2002] You say, 'what ancients'

I apparently missed one of the Crusaders, I'll have to go back and look
again.

Also, Yelinak wasn't up, so I didn't get to speak to him either.

As for the mobs themselves, I killed a few things right past the pool room,
including one bigass wyvern (that likes to warp a lot, and backstab).
Everything seems rather low MR, but IMMENSE HP. Upwards of 8pp/kill, velium
ore off golem types. no other loot, but only 3 golem kills and the bigass
wyvern.

Past the maze are a bunch of drakes and some wurms, no idea on hp/abilities,
other than that most are casters, and the earlier ones are not immune to
harmony, but resisted my first snare (then I gated because of a wurm add).
No idea on harmony status of the yellow-to-60 elder stuff farther up.
