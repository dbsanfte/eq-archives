    Aye, that part stinks. I'm surprised you don't have better, though, even
as an Iksar - no BoB/Tormax bracers?

    Depends on what you think of as "hard", really. The monks doing this
from scratch are reporting getting to the Shackle of Steel in one day. From
that point the fights are triggered - the most time-consuming steps might be
getting the six pages for the Tome and finding Cazic up to talk to him. You
only need to talk to him once, though - get the four pieces, go find Cazic,
tell him Gandan has failed, then do the combine and the hand-in. I checked
again, and you don't require anything Cazic gives you to get the bones,
flute, or old fists.

    Now, assuming the robe won't drop from the Brothers anymore, compare
that with the time it takes to do Raster, Targin, Pawbuster, and Betrayer.
If I had the levels and wanted the fastest path to Celestial Fists, it would
be via the Whistling Fists. If I'd planned well in advance and levelled in
the camps where the robe pieces drop, it would be RotWF (the Shackles are a
poor quest to do when stuff is blue - Kurn's basement is unpleasant, and
soloing Permafrost wouldn't be a picnic either).

    Hopefully that'll be the case. Especially since they seem to have taken
the Bracer off of Veltar.
