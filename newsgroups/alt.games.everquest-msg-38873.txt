I've looked at all the info on these pages and to be honest, it's not
exciting me that much.
Let me explain why. Historically MMORPG's have been about role playing. Now
wether 90% of people who play EQ are RP'ing anymore, that's a seperate
discussion. One of the reasons I enjoy EQ so much is the RP aspect. I can
take a break from RL and just enjoy doing something different for a bit.
Don't get me wrong, I am a BIG supporter of Blizzard, SC, SC/BW, D, D2.
Don't even ask how many people I got hooked on SC at work, playing in stead
of working, just don't ask. ) I've taken my D and D2 chars to 60+. I've been
active on the SC ladders. In short I know what I am speaking of when I say
that compared to EQ and AO, Blizzard makes highly addictive arcade games. In
D and D2 there is a sense of ownership in one's gear, but pretty soon,
EVERYONE has the same stuff. As for trying to make a unique char with the
different skill trees, invariably, everyone else learns the "most
successful" set of skills for a class and everyone plays that way. Sure, my
wife and I used to play D or D2 for hours on end. *Gotta get to level 40.*
*Gotta make it past this Act*, *Gotta find the waypoint*. But in the end, we
put it down. We stopped playing it because it was static. It was really just
an arcade game but without having to put quarters into the machine.
EQ on the other hand really lets you immerse yourself into a role/world that
is constantly changing and evolving. I would guess there are no 2 EXACTLY
(gear/skills) identical chars in all the EQ servers. EQ is truly a RPG,
unlike D or D2.

Now listening to the interview and looking at the info, it would appear that
WoW is STILL not going to be as serious as a RPG as EQ is now, course that
could change, but I don't think so. Look at why SC and D are successful,
they are easy to learn, fast to get into and fast to get out of. Sure
learning how to build carriers in SC is vastly different from building
tanks, but you still have to build the correct buildings to climb the tech
trees to get there. SC is like chess, the individual pieces are easy to
learn (attack, mine, build), but its putting them all together into a
complete strat that will crush your opponent, now that's the fun part to
learn.
EQ doesn't have that "learn the build order or die" mentality. You can take
it at the pace you are comfortable. If you NEVER want to melee, you can do
that. If you NEVER want to learn a trade skill you can do that. If you want
to play every race/class combo possible, you can do that. WoW is going to be
about fighting "...you won't be able to read a book while playing..." It's
going to be about fighting this or that pure and simple. Fast paced action
from start to finish. I didn't even hear anything about quests. That's good
if you like that sort of thing, not everyone is into that.

So bottom line, I am going to wait for another MMORPG that can give EQ a run
for its money. Until that time, I'll be learning as much about Norrath as I
can. I've only been playing for 2 months and I have a LONG way to go. I will
be hoping that Blizzard will make a more immersive game, but looking at
their past, I don't think they will deviate from their tried and true
pattern.

<scrape scrape> I'll get off my soapbox now. Sorry for the length of the
post.
