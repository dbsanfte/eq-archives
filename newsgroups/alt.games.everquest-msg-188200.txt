}Poor zakmuk, I just found out about the knockback myself, I came to post

}that one.

Lol, I know, following up to an old post again.  But my Shaman just dinged 
24 the other night and ran around getting his spells and had more or less 
exactly this experience.  But I thought it was a lot of fun.  Actually, 
I'd already gone to Shar Vahl and got most of the dots from the guy on the 
ledge upstairs behind the alchemist's shop.  But then I went to the 
OT outpost for scale of wolf, and was organizing my spellbook on the boat 
ride to Oasis to get creeping vision, and I noticed... Somehow I managed 
to get to level 24 without ever having bought endure posion or cure 
poison!  Shame on me!  Bad Trud!

So I got to Oasis, saw -three- and giants all up at the same time in the 
same place with nobody kiting them, which I thought was rather novel, and 
headed south.  Mr. Fist gave me a good smacking, and I thought it was 
fun, so I healed up and ran back to have another go.  I saw a bard 
creeping about up there with him though, so I gave him some space.  Sure 
enough, level 55 Bard hails him and goes flying. :)  Then I noticed a red 
guard wandering nearby that conned 'scowls' so I figured playtime was over 
and I should head back to PoK.

But it brought back memories of my first-ever GM event.  I was about level 
10 and it was right after Kunark came out.  Someone said the Iksar were 
gonna invade Oasis, so I tooled on over there to check it out.  Sure 
enough, three red to me Iksar popped up near the gypsys, and it quickly 
went (as I was soon to discover was usual) from a vague attempt at 
roleplaying to everybody and their kid brother playing 'dogpile on the 
lizard'.  I tried giving the lizzies a few whacks each with my uber Runed 
Totem Staff, but it didn't seem to do much good.  I'd liked the 
roleplaying part though, so I thought I'd try to get that back, so "Hail, 
Iksar Invader!" ...

Dayamn... I flew all the way from gypsys -through- the zone barrier and 
landed somewhere about halfway up North Ro.  I didn't die though, and I 
had a lot fewer hit points then (especially since that was my Gnomish 
enchanter... Ok, no, we were -not- made for punting, thank you very much.  
If Brell had meant for us to be punted, we woulda been born with crash 
helmets.  And stifle that bald joke please!  I saw that! :) I think it 
must be rigged to always damage you about 1/4 health or something.
