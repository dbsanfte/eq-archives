Um, ok. If it were Sony's problem, we would all be have your issues.
Fact of the matter is, for the most part, *we're not*. Sony has no
control over the route your packets take outside of their own
infrastructure. Somewhere along this route between your PC and their
servers there exists a point of unreliable negotiation. You would be
better off writing your ISP and demanding they address this with their
own bandwidth provider. Or, you could move.

What you should *not* do is get worked up and start name-calling and
making an ass of yourself without understanding the issue at least to
some small degree.

Other players have every right to treat you with contempt when you
insist upon bothering the GMs with unfounded complaints, thereby
taking their time away from handling the legitimate issues of others.
