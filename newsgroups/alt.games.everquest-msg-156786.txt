Let me see if I get this right. They raise the rates, obviously don't use
the test server befors patching, nerf the hell out of most chars (which few
can't solo) other than druids who can quad kite, and necros ( game balance
?). We as clients can't get any help from them other than making a long
distance phone call ( put on hold ). Can't get a GM online most times. Is
this really fun ? Isn't this suppose to be a game not a real life challenge
?
