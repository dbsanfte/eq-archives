Its a part of the game.

I'm not sure why these mega twinks even want to group... oh wait yes I 
do... group xp bonuses, and to show off their uberness.

Unfortunately at this stage in the game the only solution is to try to 
find similiar minded people, and group with them regularly.

I was playing my ranger a while back (13th level) with an enchanter 
twink. The enc was temperanced, and regenerating hp&mana like crazy, she 
was meleeing and chain nuking multiple reds and yellows. She didn't mez, 
charm, root, single pull... anything that an enchanter is normally known 
for. And the sad part was she didn't need to.

I left after a very short while.
