Except the new cash transfer server, and maybe the Euro servers, all of 
the servers are old now. I play on Xev, and we split from Povar and 
Tarrew back in .... 2000? 2001? Somewhere in there. Most of the low 
levels you meet are going to be twinks grouping up as they can, or as 
you say, some being PL'd by their mains if they are multi-boxing. 
Doesn't stop you from finding groups. I started a cleric myself not 
terribly long ago and quickly found groups in Paludal and then Highkeep 
at the appropriate levels. Just keep checking around. Groups are out 
there to be had. (Assuming of course you don't make a fast repuation for 
being a total fucktard.)
