Ravenscourt Park 20/3/99

Certainty level: 70%

On Saturday I went to Hammersmith, specifically Ravenscourt Park. There
had recently been a resurgence of persecution activity, following the
Capital spams. I went to the cafe in the park and had a cup of coffee
outside, with my mother. As I went inside the cafe to return the cups,
a woman shouted a sexual obscenity (not present on this audio file -
don't ask), and she said loudly "something's wrong with him". You can just
about hear it in the audio file; listen very carefully, several times; it
is distinguishable.

Much less subtle is the male voice shouting "take care he's a nutter"
immediately after the woman's voice. As on the other recordings there's
a lot of noise, but what the people say can be clearly heard.

Given that I take medication and look and behave quite sanely, and that
there had been increased abuse over the last couple of weeks, it seems
pretty unlikely that this incident was just spontaneous.... of course,
you couldn't prove otherwise, but then that's the way MI5 mean their
abuse to look.
