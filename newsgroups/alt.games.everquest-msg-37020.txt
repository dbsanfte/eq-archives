I prefer the /Anon and /Roleplay functions, especially when I play a class
that people beg stuff from 24/7

I was playing my druid a few days ago, all of a sudden I got 5 tells within
30 seconds all saying something along the lines of "D00d SoW Plz!" and at
that I just turned on Anon and SoWed them.

I always played /roleplay as my Necromancer though, I'd sometimes get
messages from people to ask if they could come and summon a corpse for them,
and sometimes they were in the weirdest places. I was laying the smackdown
on some Spirocs in TD and there was a Wood Elf Warrior who was only about
level 10 (a complete twink mind you) and he asked me if I could summon his
corpse for him, it turned out he'd strayed into the Ogre camp near the
Bloated Belly docks and they killed him.

I just sighed and walked over to it and pulled it to him. Then went Anon
hehe.

/rant off :)
