Sounds like a misunderstanding here.  You buy a crystal and hand it to
the gnome.  If you then stand on the pad you will be given the choice
to port to the zone you selected.  Perhaps the point of confusion here
is that you didn't know that the pad would also port other guild
members to the same location without having to buy a crystal?
