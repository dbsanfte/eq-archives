Ok, either you're making this up or this druid is so totally clueless as to
be beyoned belief.  PK'ers simply do not exist on "blue" servers.  I have in
my time twice seen people attempt to start "red" guilds only to have both
fail miserably after a week.  When you can't be healed, buffed, or ported by
99.9% of the population, your enjoyment of the game goes way down.

PK'ers aren't ruining the game because PK'ers don't exist.  I find it hard
to believe some druid started giving you grief about a problem that simply
doesn't exist.

/em looks puzzled

I won't disagree with the idea of someone going red on a blue server being
stupid (or, perhaps more charitablty, single-mindedly undaunted by the
overwhelming handicap entailed by going red on a blue server).  But I have
no idea why a 56 druid would care.  He can't even attack you - blue people
can't attack red people, unless you're in an arena somewhere.  It's pretty
easy to avoid other people if you're of the notion - just go /anon and use
the books to quickly get someplace you can XP in peace.

I just find it unimaginable that anyone would have this kind of reaction.
People who are red I simply shake my head at in a kind of bemused
wonderment - they're doing something unwise that means they're not going to
enjoy their EQ experience too much.  But what they do cannot impact me, and
I can't help them, so I pretty much ignore them.  That's by far the
prevalent attitude in EQ.

You sure you're not just making up this story to try and start a PK flame?
=P  I played the UO beta, and there's a reason I chose EQ over UO back in
the day.
