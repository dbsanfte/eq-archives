Oh relax, people were laughing their asses off.  And if the CS people really
didn't like me, all they had to do was hit the "BAN" button.  I was literally
asking for it, after all.  Actually, I think watching me dance around naked and
screaming somehow broke up the monotony of their day.  They would usually watch
me freak out for five or ten minutes, then boot me for that day only.

It's not that you can become godlike in UO, it's just that you can always
change.  For example, there isn't really a viable fighter/mage template
anymore.  You could, however, turn a fighter into a mage with enough work.

Hmm.  So you can't put on all sorts of clothes, dye them different colors, and
whatnot?  I like changing my appearance at will, even if it does mean looking
at the occasional moron in a frilly pink dress and a pirate hat.

WHEW!

What do they give you?

Nah, I'm no powergamer.  I just want to ramble around and have fun.

Well on one hand UO has a pretty limited array of magical items, and most of
the newer ones are only good against specific enemies.  On the other hand, a
guy can start with nothing but a pickax, a shovel, a forge, and smithing
hammer, and make a suit of full armor that is considered quite desirable.

Eh, I just like tinkering around.  If I get sick of using a shield I can go
learn archery, but I can't have both unless I give up some other skill first.

>If you enjoy the Hobbesian spirit of random murder in UO, I

Each UO server has two "copies" of the world now:  One with PVP and one
without.  So anyone who gets murdered these days had to make the choice to go
somewhere they knew it could happen.

Hmm.  So far EQ sounds interesting, if a bit limited in terms of customizing
your character.  I like the idea of playing a troll or an ogre...
