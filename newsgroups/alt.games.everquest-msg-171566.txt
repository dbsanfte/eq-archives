He's not talking about lv 50+ I agree for lv 50+ it hasn't ruined
anything, below that it's definately changed things.  But I have to say
in opposition to the tanks not getting groups, I've occasionally been
refused a group as a cleric even with soloing tanks who are twinked. 
This has happened a lot earlier than kei was ever in place.  And what
exactly lv 20 caster that ISN'T twinked going to be able to afford a
kei?  Especially if they ae going to the usual soloing places, then
theres no loot to be had to recoup that expense.

AFAIK Kei leveled the playing field, now both tank and casting twinks
can solo fast.  Those who aren't twinks are now in a quadrupally worse
situation.  1:  There's less and less places to actually find groups at
low levels - 2: which now seems to be considered anything below 56 as
opposed to the old days of about 40.  3: Anyone twinking isn't going to
want a group with someone who isn't similarly equiped, and now both
tanks (equpment) and casters (kei) can be twinked effectively. 

Alright #3 is an exaggeration,  I always try to get groups with my
twinks since I feel guilty about soloing when my twinkage could easily
help more than just me.

#1 is if anything understated.  I'm on a fairly old server Brell.  I am
lucky to get a group with my lv 32 cleric and have been since I started
playing with her, even if she's got a kei.  I have a hell of a time
getting a group with my lv 54 enchanter, of course I'm probably not
trying too hard since I can charm solo about 1&1/2 times faster than
even the best group I've been in.
