Did I read that correctly? Did you claim that the trials are trivial for 
some classes? Anyway, so the xp zones decrease when you hit 61 and 62. 
They still exist. Why is it such blasphemy to suggest people go out and 
prepare themselves by gaining a couple more levels first? I'll answer 
that myself. Because it requires more effort than other zones would. 
Well, guess what? Pass the trials and you can go to the other zones. 
Otherwise, you should be willing to do what is necessary to help your 
cause.
