I don't have to imagine it, because it's true now.   What do druids
offer in transportation?   Ports (so do wizards, and, at least in
Kunark and Velious, to near the same spots), SoW (so do rangers
and shaman, and no serious raid goes without a shaman, right?),
and levitate (DMF is longer-lasting and most raids will have a
necro for corpse retrieval and mana purposes, or, if not that, mages
will be along for Call of the Hero and can summon lev rings.)  If you're
talking a raid where Evacs are useful, don't wizards get those too,
and without the danger of porting into a druid ring where some of
the people might be KoS?

At least from a pure transportation viewpoint, druids offer nothing
that another class can't supply, and those classes will be coming
along anyway.   The only exception I can think of is raids of Fear,
where the druid portal is much closer that the nearest wizard
portal.   For that one exception on a planar level, wizards get too
planes to which they are required to port, and druids can port to
the other, but can't really participate in the raid without worrying
about their faction.

At any rate, for the higher-level raids, I don't see where that's an
issue even today.   For mid-level raids, it's still not a real issue,
except for places in the southeast of the old world where druid
portals are much closer (CT, Guk, Fear.)

So again, other than derailing the money train, how would easy,
on-demand NPC (or item) ports ruin the porting classes?
