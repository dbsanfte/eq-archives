    So every raid-level target would be a triggered spawn, since if it were
already up the encounter couldn't be balanced against the raid? Have you
seen the problems SOE has with getting a simple triggered spawn encounter to
work correctly, and you want the spawn to check against collective
statistics for a raid? Never mind trying to balance what drops against the
actual effort required to beat the encounter, since apparently the encounter
could be very weak or strong depending on who shows up. Totally unworkable.
