On the one hand, they are different characters, and EQ is theoretically a
role-playing game, which argues for it not being any concern of the guild.

On the other hand, it is usually expected that a guilded character will be
played a reasonable amount so as to contribute something to the guild.  That
is harder to do if one is playing multiple characters in multiple guilds.
As guilds get into raiding or other guild events, it can become imporant for
members to be available, and what happens when both guilds have a raid at
the same time?

My guild was a family-type guild.  What we did was have a channel, which we
mostly used instead of guildchat.  Then, people who were playing alts that
weren't in our guild, or people that had left our guild on friendly terms,
could still participate in our chat.
