MT'ing for groups generally, though some solo play in there too, as well as
some taunt-tanking where *my* damage output wasn't even a factor.

Karnors at 40, 45 and 50 was a great example.  I always test my solo ability
when possible, and took my ranger into Karnors quite young.  Even at 50, I
couldn't actually *kill* most mobs there solo, so damage output didn't
matter as all my experimentation ended in me zoning rather than the mob
dying sooner than it did before.

At 40, I was zoning out *real* fast.  At 50, and with an admitted hp
increase as a result, I could stand there and take it far longer than the
15% increase in time my extra HP should have allowed me to under your
theory.

No, no, no.  Resists aren't based on level at *all*!  The only thing that
matters is your resist stats...  doh, wait, thought I was you for a minute. 
Seriously, though, not all that much casts in Karnors.

Yeah, sadly.  Though as my ranger was "twinked" it's not as bad as it sounds
(reverse-twinked, rather, as my ranger was my original character that was
abandoned and then later heavily twinked and leveled up).

>Do you have logs to demonstrate
>your claim of improved damage taking ability?

I actually have logs of my entire playtime since the date they added the
auto-log feature.  It was such an obvious affect, though, that I felt no
need to do any parsing.  Parsing is great for telling the 2% difference
between haste items, but my eyes are perfectly fine for telling larger
differences.

Utterly surprising.  Utterly conflicting with what most rangers experienced
from 40 to 50 where, in spite of not gaining any defense increase, we still
gained in tanking ability.

I agree, if it is false it should be trivially easy to show.  Hopefully
someone who *understands* the concept of an objective test will enlighten us
all one way or the other.  You approach your tests with a bias, and guide
the tests to exaggerate those aspects that support your bias.

I would agree, basically, that a small level difference can be overcome with
large amounts of twinking.  That's the whole concept behind twinking.  :)

Excellent.  Tests that are worth examining.  I look forward to them.
