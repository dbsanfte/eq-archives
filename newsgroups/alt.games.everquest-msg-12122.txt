Find a product that is tedious to get but is worthwhile for higher level
characters . It cant be one that is store bought and should be one that has
a wide niche use . High quality bear skins ,high quality cat skins , oak
leaves are all examples that tailors might use . orc belts or goblin beads
also a popular faction item . Banking gold and silver for plat or gems is a
service most old characters need from time to time . Food delivery can work
especially if you can make pizzza :) Just advertise you are for hire,
listing any special skills you have and im sure you will get other
suggestions . 5 is a bit low btw you should probably wait till you have a
bit more survivability before leaving wherever home is .
