Thanks for reminding me. I seem to forget sometimes that those kind of
things do make a difference. See my other post...here is the info anyway
though.

Also to add to my questions, some info.
RACE: Barbarian
CLASS: Warrior
RELIGION: None (agonistic)
SEX: Male (I know this doesn't matter for NPCs...only to PCs).
ARMOR: Mix of banded and bronze
STR: 133 total, carrying about 115
Never killed a lizard, froglok, or anything south of S Ro (never been there
with this character).
