Based on played time.  Fairly meaningless because of two things:

Bazaar mules (lots level 1, but lots of "old twinks")

and

"Raid's over, logging in the twink."

They could make it a more meaningful statistic by including a correlation
statistic of how many accounts are actively played that do *not* have a
level 50+ character.
