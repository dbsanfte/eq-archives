"gimme kei plz i will give u 5p" doesn't constitute "meeting new people,"
sorry.  Grouping would qualify for that but you don't group.

/em raises hand.  I have always gotten a dozen tells a day from people
begging for kei and willing to accept me as their buff whore.  Gee, thanks,
I just love receiving unsolicited tells from people who don't know what
"mana management" means and assumes because I have the spell I should cast
it on them...that somehow my mana (and lots of it) belongs to them.

I've always enjoyed people putting cash in my trade window without asking me
first. I feel SO special as a vending machine to idiots who don't take
silence for an answer.
