Welcome to the world of the soloing enchanter. :) Root, then charm, then 
pull target mob close to pet.  Get far enough away to reroot as necessary.

There's a bunch of other ways to do it, but I generally avoid doing it at 
all if I can.  Just finding a group leads to sooo much less death.  It'd 
be different if I had Jboots, of course...
