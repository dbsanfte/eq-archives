If you are doing a clean sweep and formatting your drive might I suggest you
go a step farther than just backing up a few files.  I recommend doing an
fdisk and partitioning your drive to create two drives.  I have partitioned
my 30G drive into a 4G primary partition and used the rest as the second
partition.  What benefits can be had from doing this?  Well, for one thing,
you never have to reinstall Everquest again if you install it to the second
partition.  I have been doing this for a long time and find that a small
primary partition for the OS (Win98SE in this case) works great. I use 4G,
but you could use less if you wish.

The other advantages to this are other things like ICQ.  Ever had to
reinstall ICQ after a HD format and get all those pesky authorizations
again?  Well, if you have, you would really like just reinstalling right
over the old directory on the second partition and having all those contacts
be there as if you never reinstalled at all.  You can copy all your
documents from the My Documents folder to that partition as well.  Along
with favorites, and whatever else you can think of that you want to save
indefinitely.

I had to format and reinstall last night due to an odd problem that stemmed
from either a bit of bad apps or a virus.  If it was a virus, I never had
any indication from McAfee, but that isn't the point.  The point is, it took
me very little time to format/install,  plus everquest didn't need anything
at all except a shortcut created for my quick launch bar.  There are several
other programs in my second partition that are like that and require nothing
but a new shortcut created.  I have been doing this for a year or two now
and it works great.

I also find that copying the Win98 installation CD, along with Office 2000,
makes the format/install much quicker as well.  You still need the CD keys,
but never have to put a CD into the drive for driver updates, etc.  I think
the longest part of the whole format/install process for me, is the updates
after the fact.  I have a directory created just for many of the larger
updates and patch files, but having a cable modem makes that less critical.

Hope that helps.  If you have already formatted/installed maybe it is food
for thought the next time you format.
