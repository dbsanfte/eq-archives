It has been my experience that just because a server is up, doesn't mean you
can log it.  The program I use always shows (1) player on the server, so my
guess is SOMEONE has to log into that server to test the patching...heck,
maybe even to do the patching...shrug...just bad PR overall in my
opinion...I use SBC for my DSL...they send a nice note two days in advance
explaining service outage, why, and the time frame...and have NEVER missed
it yet!...THAT is customer service...
