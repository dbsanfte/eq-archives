Yep, that happenden a good deal on Veeshan too, especially in WC.
40 people shouting not to kill the Werewolf Overlord, some moron does anyway.
Most fun i had out of it was one of the times the moron fighter that killed it
answered saying it attacked him and he as a fighter always fight to the death.

Well, wrote his name down, if i ever see him in trouble ill be sure not to help
if he start to run.
