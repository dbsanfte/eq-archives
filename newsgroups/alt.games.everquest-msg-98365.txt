Shortly after release? When, exactly, was it changed? I can't remember
it being changed, and I played for months after release before taking
one of my long breaks. Of course, I didn't read patch messages too
closely back then either, so it might've slipped by me.

(A long pause while Rune digs around on the web)

(Bleah, ok, so it was changed on 5/24, two months and a bit after
release. That's what happens when I check my facts before posting
nonsense to Usenet. It's no fun!)

All that aside, I didn't *make* any argument, I stated a fact. I think
you're confusing me with someone else here.
