    There's evidence for the latter. See the Quellious (as in religion)
monks and their complaints about previously not being able to get  enough
faction in Cabilis to do the Shackle quests. I thought they'd removed those

guess not.

    Chuckle - so, do you folks have a key yet? And have you started farming

    Dubious is a deep faction level, but it is cause to wonder.
