Bullshit, and if you truly think this, you should spend more time
reading actual gameplay discussions and less time flaming people.  I
am sorry though, I used nobody, while Verant used no one.

The first issue addressed in the Warrens is the problem of higher
level characters competing with lower level characters for loot on
lower level creatures. To address this issue, in the Warrens, a group
that 'outclasses' a particular foe will not receive any loot that is
MAGIC, LORE, or NODROP. All other loot will drop. 'Outclassing' a foe
is defined as having a group makeup such that no one in your group
receives experience from the kill. This can happen if, for instance,
the foe is 'green' to all group members, or if the group makeup is of
such a wide level range that the system determines the fight was
unbalanced using regular experience rules.

Any time that an NPC would have dropped special loot and does not due
to it being outclassed, a message indicating that the combat was
'trivial' will be displayed to the group.
