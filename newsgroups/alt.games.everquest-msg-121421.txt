Was wondering if any warriors (or former warriors) could tell me where a
forge is to create the BattleSomthingOrOther armor...I have the helm mold
and the item that the chest creates, but I'm stuck as to where a forge I can
use is...I checked out one of the weapon merchants, but that didn't seem to
be a usable forge in Qeynos is...

Thanks,

JD
