Note that Brad and Verant were quite quiet on the subject in the
post-beta period of EQ until it's success was guaranteed as well so he
wasn't quite the knight in shining armor you portray here. In early EQ,
people used many stuck mob exploits to level and got off with mere
warnings. The first 2 people to 50 on Tarew Marr used mob sticking
exploits, first in Unrest basement then in the Spectre caves in Feerott
to get there and were still playing for years afterward. In early EQ
days they didn't ban at all for these exploits, prefering to quietly fix
them in code. I was a bit disappointed after the public bans for
exploiting they'd used in beta, but I guess their legal department
wouldn't let them do public bannings, even when it was just someone's in
game user name that was made public.
