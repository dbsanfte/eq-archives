    Did you have them all in your CH chain, leaving at random to help heal
their group? No? Then you understand what I'm saying. Clerics and other
healers OUTSIDE THE CH CHAIN do the spot heals, your AoE heals, etc. Not
your chain members.

    You won't have DPS if you let the MA die, because they will all be
eaten. The CH chain is supposed to be just enough healing, modulo things
like spellshield for ugly procs, to keep the MA alive. All the other healers
should be doing the AoE heals, the cures, the res/rebuff, etc. I've seen
what happens when you don't do it that way, and it's comical. Case in point:
our first Xegony runs. One cleric in the chain was convinced that he had to
DI the main tank if it dropped, because DI is very important and he had UD
3. Well, this is what the timeline looked like:

MT tells the raid, "NEW DI"
Cleric tells the group, "Casting DI on MT - SKIP ME"
Six seconds later, DI lands on MT.
Five seconds after that: MT has been saved by divine intervention!
MT tells the raid, "NEW DI".

    By dropping out of the chain, the cleric created a 4-5 second gap in
healing. Guess what? Unless you get lucky, you can't tank Xegony for 4 to 5
seconds without healing. So boom, DI goes off again, the cleric has wasted
their time, and if we get unlucky and DI doesn't go off the MT eats dirt.
The better strategy is the simplest one: instead of having a cleric in the
chain also DI, and hope that their healing isn't required (not bloody
likely) or that someone else outside the chain covers, have the someone
outside the chain be the one to cast DI and keep the chain going. Then you
don't get any healing gaps and you're less likely to require the DI in the
first place.

    We need people to loot all the knight weapons, or we can't target past
the corpses. =/
