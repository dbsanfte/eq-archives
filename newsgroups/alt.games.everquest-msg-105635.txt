And NL has a nice, wide, perfectly-safe (at most levels, certainly with
SoW unless you're unlucky) highway to travel as well.   So, it's not
all tunnels, etc.

Personally I find it amazing how much Usenet tough guys have to
stretch to see everything as black and white and any rational
discussion as an argument.   Free hint:  everyone who doesn't
agree with you isn't necessarily spoiling for a fight with you.

Is Echo Caverns a dungeon?  It's pretty much the same as NL.
Pass-through zone, with pockets of mobs here and there.  It's
certainly not designed like Seb or Crushbone or Blackburrow
or Runnyeye or Splitpaw.   In fact, it bears a pretty nice
resemblance, IMO, to Rathe Mountains on a smaller, indoor
scale.   I wouldn't call it a dungeon, either.

But that's just my definition.  And my definition has more do to
with the idea that dungeons are filled with a succession of
progressively harder encounters that you can't avoid (unless, as
in lots of places in EQ, it's camped by another group or the
encounters can be avoided by Invis or IVU) which terminate in
a boss mob that you kill and can then exit (lower Guk fits this
definition, for instance) or kill and then work your way back out
(Infected Paw, etc.) than any pure physical ("but it's got caves
and it's inside") definition.

By that definition, neither Echo Caverns or NL are dungeons.
Hence my question:  they don't fit my definition; why are they
"obviously" dungeons?
