When adapting means you are casting 2 nukes per mob, so you wait till 
80% for the first nuke and wait till 40 on the second nuke, thats quite 
true.

But when adapting means you go from casting 3 nukes (say at 90, 60, 30) 
to casting 2 (80 40), then it -isn'- a case of lazy, its a case of the 
warrior's aggro limiting your ability to deal damage.  With today's 
focus, FT, KEI environment, its often possible to do more damage than 
aggro will permit.

If aggro control means backstab followed immediately by evade, then its 
no problem.  But if it means delaying backstabs till you see a warrior 
weapon proc, then its slowing down stabs per minute.

If aggro control means the ranger has to jolt occaisionally, then thats 
the ranger's problem.  But if it means he has to put away his highest 
damage producing weapons and use something with less aggro even though 
it does less damage (perhaps slower, perhaps without procs) then its 
reducing his DPS.

Another problem with aggro is slow.  Slow a mob on incoming, versus 
slowing a mob at 80%, thats allowing a mob to do its full damage rate 
for 20% of its life span.  Since this full damage rate is typically 4 
times its slowed rate, thats 80% more damage dealt by the mob than one 
who was slowed on incoming.  Your healer is now having to spend nearly 
twice as much mana per fight, potentially.

And speaking of your healer, even if the slow thing is ignored, if he 
has to wait longer before landing a heal, that can mean in a spiky 
damage environment, more deaths on the part of the warrior.   If he 
heals sooner, (which often he must due to the slow thing) then he's 
likely to get aggro, which wouldn't have happened with the knight MT's. 
This is compounded by the fact that paladins have LOH in case of 
incipent disaster, and SK (assuming there's another tank handy to hold 
aggro temporarily) can FD if their heal is coming a bit late.

SK and Paladin's ability to hold aggro can mean more damage from your 
DPS classes.  In particular a paladin's ability to stun can mean that 
who has aggro at any given moment isn't all that relevant, as the mob 
can be halted in its tracks for long enough to get aggro back, even if 
the stun itself didn't achieve the job.  Similarly, the SK's snare means 
that at least for casters, getting aggro doesn't mean the mob will 
actually get to them before the SK has it back.

Compound that by the fact that warriors have no utility purpose at all; 
paladins bring backup healing, buffs, lull, root, stuns; SK bring snare, 
FD, other buffs (including the tap to benefit group series).  Warriors 
bring.. what, more HP?  Only they don't bring more HP anymore!

The changes being worked out on test seem to be designed to address 
these problems, warriors should have better aggro, and their own unique 
utility in the  form of those melee openings, whatever they end up 
consisting of.

I can't comment on the details (as I don't know them and haven't done 
the research to find out about them) but this suggests to me that SOE at 
least understands the problem.

In my opinion, they are solving it wrong; the solution I would have 
preferred would have been to (largely) eliminate the aggro problem 
(which they seem to be doing) and to restore the HP difference warriors 
used to enjoy (pre velious, warriors tended to have 25% or so more HP 
than a comperably equipped knight) and fix the AC system so a difference 
in AC means better mitigation; and if knights now enjoy the same high AC 
as warriors, fix that too.

In other words, keep playing a warrior relatively simple, give them 
taunt enough to not damage the other member's of their group ability to 
use all their advantages, and give them an advantage, not in flexibility 
or utility (which should be what knights get in exchange for giving up 
some of their ability to sponge) but in sheer ability to soak up damage.

Either way, though, you are tampering with a somewhat delicate balance; 
once upon a time warriors were unquestioned kings of the Tank field and 
knights could go hours begging for a group while people shouted group of 
five looking for a warrior right next to them.  Now, Paladins and 
Shadowknights share the throne and often warriors can go fish while 
groups wait for a real tank.

The danger here is of swinging the pendulum back to the warrior, 
screwing two classes to fix one!

ps: all this said, I'll add that I normally group with warrior MA, both 
in Winterfury's circle of friends, and in my regular nightly LDoN 
group... heck, the LDoN group core is warrior, cleric, paladin, and me, 
and -still- the warrior is MA.  Does Winterfury take a beating from 
slowing early?  Yes, but shaman are well suited to taking the 
occaisional beating in the environments we've been in thus far.  Do I 
get pounded in my LDoN group?  Not often, no, I'm still mana limited to 
the point where I usually can't sustain a nuke rate high enough to get 
aggro, plus there's the paladin to quickly grab it away from me in an 
emergency, and there's also my pet; if I'm using air or earth I usually 
can ditch aggro fairly quickly.

But from my former life as a 65 cleric, I know that these things can 
become more and more of a problem as the mobs start getting tougher and 
the caster gear starts getting better.  Where right now we can shrug off 
the odd aggro accident, later we'll be looking at mobs that can one 
round us, heck, unslowed may be able to one round our warriors!
