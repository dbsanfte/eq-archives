This is where your argument falls apart.

No, characters are not relatively equal in power at the same level.  Some
classes start very strong and it tails off as they get higher. Some classes
like wizards are mediocre at low levels.. and look what they develop into.

Thats another bad assumption.  2 different classes wielding the same weapon
do NOT produce the same level of dps with the weapon. Infact in some cases
the contrast is huge.

Monks are on the highest combat table. Guess what that means... yep, more
DPS with the same/similar weapons.

Pet classes are a bit difficult to compare to pure melees.. I mean at the
very low levels, pets are king.  Getting a yellow con pet who can tear
through things solo at low levels, compared to a pet tanking anything 60+
(pop).. the contrast is quite sharp.  Im sure you understand the basic
concept that some classes / spell lines etc gain and reduce strength during
the leveling process.

Beastlord is probably the strongest class in-game right now.. (i say
probably because im sure somebody will disagree for the sake of arguing) Not
because they are the best, but because their spell line covers so much.

No pure melee has the same kind of group desirability as a beastlord (same
for a lot of casters too).. but if you already have a shaman or chanter.. if
your friend is a monk/ranger/rogue.. well you aren't going to be crippled by
taking them instead of a beastlord.

Go with your beastlord.  Playing a strong to the point of overpowered class
can go a long way in helping to bridge for lack of skill gaps.
