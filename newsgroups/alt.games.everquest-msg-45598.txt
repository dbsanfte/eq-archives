I -think- this is what I did:
I ended up reading a HOW-TO on IPTables and created my own chain rules, and
then saved them to a file.  This is the file that I made my
/etc/sysconfig/iptables, using iptables-save, I believe.

I had to dink a little with my /etc/rc.d/init.d/iptables to make it work,
though, but I don't remember what I did besides add in the line:

echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

This is the quick HOWTO I used:

You can in Mandrake, also.  You can probably do this:

/etc/rc.d/init.d/network restart

to jumpstart the whole network.  If you just rebind a card or something, you
can use ifconfig, I think.

Notice all the "probably"s and "I think"s ? =)  I'm no guru, by far.

This could cause problems, as I have a static IP and it is hard-coded in my
/etc/sysconfig/iptables.  If you are using dial-up, your IP may be handled
via an environment variable, so it is still usable in the your scripts.

Go into X, and run the control panel that is on the desktop.  You can
configure your IP-Masquerading ( internet sharing ) in there, I think, and
it will hopefully do it all for you.

Welcome, just keep in mind the use of the words "probably" and "think"...

I would be more definite if I were in front of the machine.  Good luck and
please -do- post any progress or failures and we will eventually get you up
and going.
