    I have taken a little different approach because when I got my cable
connection (RoadRunner) routers were still relatvely expensive.
    I have 2 IPs from Roadrunner, Got the cable line running from the modem
to the uplink port on a Netgear 10/100 hub. This then splits to the 2 PCs.
It's cheap and works very well, the only thing I don't ahve is a hardware
firewall.
