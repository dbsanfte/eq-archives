That's because the AC and STR buffs are never cast on anyone, not worth 
the mana unless someone needs a quick boost in str for encumbrance

Also, on the bard, the bard haste can be a stacking haste that puts the 
melee over the normal haste cap, so is great for adding on top of 
shaman/enchanter/bl haste.
