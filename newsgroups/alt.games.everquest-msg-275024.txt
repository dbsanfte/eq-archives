Agreed, I play both EQ and WoW; while graphically WoW is a more beautiful 
game, I still like EQ enough to continue playing it as well. EQ2 is, IMO, 
just boring, so you're not missing anything by your computer not being 
advanced enough to play it. As for soloing, it's just as fun in EQ as it's 
ever been (I tend to solo a lot when I'm not playing a cleric), and the 
population base hasn't fallen QUITE as much as Mr. Bitterness claims. :) I 
would recommend you get the trial version of EQ (available from the website, 
www.everquest.com I believe) and find someone who has a 10 day free guest 
pass for WoW and try them both to see which you'd prefer before just taking 
a very bitter (obvious from his post) person's viewpoint as gospel. :)
