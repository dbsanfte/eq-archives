 And your source for this is what? I don't recall Vernat saying they did
such a thing but I could have missed it.

 I think it's all random. A few times we've fought other dragons
(Gorenaire, Hoshkar, Phara Dar) and they only got 1 AoE off. True, they
only have 32k and die fairly fast, but in a few instances they had
rather long gaps where they could have AoEd but didn't. I think the last
time we killed Lendiniara she got off a lot more than 3 and there was
about the same amount of people there.
