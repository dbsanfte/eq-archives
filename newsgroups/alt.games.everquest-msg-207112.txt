It doesn't make a difference unless you are lagged.  Feigning automatically
turns off attack, but for whatever goofy reason that isn't always seen by
the server when you are lagged.  Sending through an attack off command
manually guarantees that the server sees attack turn off before it sees you
try to feign.

Simple hotkey that I've used since not long after I got feign...

/attack off
/doability 1
