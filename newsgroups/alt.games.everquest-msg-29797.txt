Can't answer for everyone.  The reason I have win2k on my system is that it
is by far the most stable windows I have ever used.  I don't feel 1337
because I have it.  So far I have been willing to put up with the sound
problems I have with EQ for the convenience of not having my system crash
far too frequently.  I may try the dual boot thing at some point, if the
sound issues get annoying enough.
