So, about a month after the progression servers opened up, I attempted to 
create a character using a name I often use - nothing too common. It's 
rejected. Bummer. I just figured someone else had taken it.

A week or so ago, I tried to create that same character again, and, what do 
ya know, that same name goes through. Woot! Not too worried about why, I'm 
just happy it worked.

Well, tonight, I decided to re-roll that character as a different class. I 
delete it, create a new character in about 30 seconds using the same 
name...and it was rejected. 

How exactly does the name filter/human approval process work? Is it 
possible that one GM allowed the name while another may find something 
wrong with it, and it all depends on who is monitoring them at the time?
