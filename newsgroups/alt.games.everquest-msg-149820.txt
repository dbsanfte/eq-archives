If I remember correctly those pit traps drop you into the cell with an
enchanter named Linara or something close. She is a NPC in the Mystic
Cloak quest.

The key you need to give her is the bronze key dropped by the Priest
of Najena in Unrest. I'm not sure if that key opens the door.

The guards also drop " guards keyring" which would make sense that
they open the cells but I never tried.

So to sum it up....I have no idea :)
