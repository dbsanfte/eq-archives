The patch notes for LU #12 are up on test and look to have some pretty
intesting things in it.  Some of the things that I think will be the
best are:

- Change your bind point to anywhere in your home city!  (I might as
well bind right in front of the mender)
- In addition to completing writs that are assigned to you by city
NPCs, you can now earn guild status by turning in new kinds of dropped
items.  (This could be a nice bonus if it is on random critters rather
than specific mobs)
- Guilds no longer lose status or levels when a patron leaves the guild
or ceases to be a patron. Thus, guilds never lose the levels they have
already earned.  (This cuts down on the damage that some guilds have
seen where their high level patrons leave for another guild)

The Live Event sounds like fun also - of course I have a special place
in my heart for ratonga ;)  I'm really looking forward to trying the
single group zone that is suppose to be 'highly challenging' for high
level adventurers.  Right now, I think the only zone that fits that
description might be Sanctum of Fear - and as long as you are careful
that zone isn't overly taxing.

One change that should spice things up is "- The area-of-effect range
of large creatures now matches the range in which you can hit them."  I
wonder if that is just melee or ranged also.  Is that limited to Wrath
of Fury, or other AEs as well?

Overall, this looks to be a pretty decent update after the somewhat
mediocre showing (Splitpaw excluded) of LUs #10 and #11.
