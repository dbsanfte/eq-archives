Hmm, the core problem is that EverQuest didn't use to be XP Compliant
fully, and was marked as such by Microsoft.  Which means XP doesn't let it
do certain stuff (like alt-tab).  They fixed that quite a while ago (Sony),
but XP still has EverQuest listed as non-compatable.

Now you have two options, 1. use the XP Compatibility Kit to mark EverQuest
as compatible or 2. install SP2 which automatically does #1.

I'm not sure I can blame Sony for this, since it's XP that's stopping the
cursor from working, and XP that needs to be changed?

You can download the XP Compat Kit (7MB) and use that to fix it - but
honestly, if you're running XP, why aren't you already running SP2 is the
question I'd be asking.
