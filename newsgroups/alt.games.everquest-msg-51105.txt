Same here, I spent ages trying to work out why my PC would stutter running
EQ (AMD 1200, 512mb ram and a GF3) then realised it was Norton that was the
problem.
I have set norton so it doesn't load on boot but the problem is still there,
guess I rather have the protection than not.
I wonder if Mcaffee's would be any better.
