Let's just say that, during my career, I have had to encounter the
"radicals" from all the loony left..  It's hard to believe, after
seeing them, that there can be moderates who profess the same
beliefs...

No, but comparing religion and a lifestyle is not a fair comparison,
by society's standards of today..

Which is not to say that I agree with those standards..  Trust me, you
don't want to get me started on a religious debate...  :^)

Let's just say it is the "official" position of many, if not all, gay
PACs...

Actually, I am as open-minded as they come.  You won't find a bigoted
bone in my body..

Simply because I disagree with you on points......

Let me put it this way...

You don't know even a miniscule enough about me to make ANY kind of
determination.
