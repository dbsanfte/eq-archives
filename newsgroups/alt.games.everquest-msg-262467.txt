Where that falls apart a bit is if someone's news server doesn't get a few
posts.  Or perhaps if the OP is someone who's been killfiled, but a
subthread is started which holds interest.

I personally wouldn't take the time to go through a completely top posted
Usenet post to try separating the wheat from the chaff.  I have to do it
from time to time with work-related emails that have been through multiple
hands, and it's a pain in the ass.
