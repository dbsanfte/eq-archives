Hi guys!

I am RNG and my partner is DRU. We are both 54. We are kinda want to get
out of 54, second hardest for both of us. The hardest is 59. Anyway, I
would like to know what would be the best tactic for a duo like us and
where should we hunt?
I was thinking BW. Tactic would be. The RNG pull mob(s) to camp. DRU
Root and DoT. RNG will tank if Roots break or will finish the mob off
when mob's health is below 20%.
Any better sugestions as where to camp and/or better approch?

Thanks a bunch!
