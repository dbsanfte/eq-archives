right on
i charge whatever the market will bear
been known to give extra pieces of banded in deals
been known to laugh at people and tell them to go away
right now, got a full set of large plate, dyed red on all showing pieces,
asking 3000pp as a min, too much?
then don't buy it, my ogre sk is happy wearing it   :)
when it finally does sell, think i will make him a green set
