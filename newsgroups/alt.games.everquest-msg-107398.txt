My 34 Druid Halfling was passing throught the Innothule Swamp on his way to
Guk.  In the dark he drifted South of his intened due East course and
crossed the path of one of the newbie guards, Basher Smag.  Paying no heed
to da basher since nothing in the swamp had ever aggroed him, he just walked
by him.

Whack, whack, whack, dead.  My Druid comes back invis and finds da basher
had drug his corpse to his camp and is standing gurard over it.  He drags
his corpse a little way and whack, dead again.  Thinking "Superior
Camaflouge my ass" and that invis had worn off AGAIN at an inopportune
moment, he goes back again and when his is close casts a fresh invis.

This time he sees the basher has both corpses at his feet.  He succeeds in
dragging one corpse and stripping it of its two foraged mushrooms, but when
he drags the second one - yepper, whack and dead again!

Finally, he gets hold of a necro friend, ports the the friend to Tox, a
short walk and two quick summon spells and all is well.

Friends, please tell me why did Basher Smag aggro me?  Also, if I did not
have any friends online, how could I have extracated myself from this mess?
