}Good.  How soon can you get to Canada? :D

Well, actually, I'm not all that far from Canada at the moment, and I've 
never been there...

Just tryin' to maintain my evil rep. :)  Of course, you could just check 
periodically to see if someone else has spawned it.

}Translate or die, evil gnome.

Bah, I already did.  You should read crossposted threads more. :)

Of course, it has a typo, and I should have changed it a bit anyway.  As 
it stands, it's "Evil is the user interface, who finds evil there"...

Shoulda been "Mal est elle, qui mal y trouve", "Evil is she who finds evil 
there".
