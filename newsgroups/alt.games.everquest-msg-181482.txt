My thoughts on this window shopping idea.... It could be a
possibility, but Id think the individual a COMPLETE dumb ass.  Why on
earth would anyone do a search with just "Human" or any other race,
you would get so many items unuseable to your Class.  and even if you
did a Search by Class, and Race, why not limit the search even more so
you can actualy get all the possible items listed.  Window shopping
instead of using the tools available, would be an extream waste of
time.
