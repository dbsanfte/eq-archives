Noone with a shred of common sense would run for office.  This includes me.

I'm "wish libertarian had a ghost of a chance" anarchist.

That government governs' best which governs least, I'm QUITE upset that the tiny
movement in the republican/democrat balance just put one party in charge of all
three elected bodies, and in a position to appoint tons of republican pukes to
the judiciary as well.

I'm approximately as upset as I would be if democrats were in the same position,
except that democrats seem to be a little wimpier about abusing that kind of
power with both hands (they lean towards not letting the left hand know what the
right hand is doing)
