While it would be nice to imagine this is correct, it is not.

Verant will only act on activities they have witnessed.  The odds of
a staff member a day or two after a reported event logging in in GM
invisible mode and shadowing that guy you reported around in the
hopes of catching him KSing are very low.

Also, Kill Stealing, as Verant defines it, has a very limited scope.
Walk into a camp where something is standing, untouched, tap
it on the shoulder, and walk off with it, and its yours, no kill steal
involved.  There may be two groups of people actively involved
in killing one mob after another out of that spawn, but ownership
of a mob goes -only- to the first person to deliberately aggro it.

While the EQ community as a whole believes in the concept of
claiming static camps, Verant does not support this concept in
any way.  In fact, if your nemisis there slaps a snare on a lego
in Orc 1, which your group has had camped for the past couple hours,
and you hit it with a AOE while grabbing another spawn next to
it, then-you- are guilty of kill stealing, even though you might think
he was trying to make off with your rightful mob, and that happy
accident set things aright.

So, be careful what you report, and don't bother doing it unless
the incedents are ongoing.  When and if you -do- report, for
Brell's sake don't tell the guy or ooc the zone, the point is to
let a GM come in in invisible mode and watch him do it.  If
what you want is for him to go away, then you might try claiming
you reported it... but if you really want him warned or (if a repeat
offender) his account cancelled, then don't let him know you narced!
