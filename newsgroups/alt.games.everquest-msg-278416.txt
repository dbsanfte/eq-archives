I remember reading in an EQ strat guide (I believe it was the Kunark volume 
from...Prima?) that magicians had the best damage shields in the game. In 
perusing some other forums, I noticed a listing of the mage and druid 
damage shields, and it appeared that these days the druid's are better. Is 
this true, or was the information I saw incomplete?
