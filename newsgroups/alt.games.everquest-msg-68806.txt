Ah, the ol' Catch 22.  Those who are organized with a plan bring their own
group.

Unfortunately if you want to group you'll probably have to go to the lemming
zones such as Oasis (teens), Lake of Ill Omen (I forget if you have the
expansions) (teens-twenties), South Karanas (20s).

Then keep your eyes peeled for guild tags.  See which guilds are full of
idiots and which have good players.  Then do a /who all "guild name" and see
if they're any place you'd like to go and send them a tell asking if they
have room for you in their group.  If they like you after hunting with them
they'll probably offer to let you join.
