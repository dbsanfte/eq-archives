Oh dear. I logged on this morning to see the next hilariouse installment
from Scott and the witisims of all in reply but it seems as though he ran
away after the latest foundless theories of his were debunked. I guess he
was just a kid. I really did enjoy some of the humor in this thread tho....I
thought Graeme Faelban had two particularly funny one liners.
