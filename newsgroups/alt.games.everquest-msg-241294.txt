Well, it did get taken care of... today my character was rewound to
the point I'd logged out during the session previous to my mishap.

So... it seems I'm also required to retract my frustration about
failing that ldon adventure with the rescuee meters from the exit...
since it never happened; I never got that sta augment, or the half
level either.

All in all I'm pretty satisfied... Disapointed I couldn't play him for
a couple days.And it looks like its going to be a few more after
all... I breifly logged in to see what they'd done to me and was
promptly advised the servers were going to be brought down for another
patch...

Ugh.
