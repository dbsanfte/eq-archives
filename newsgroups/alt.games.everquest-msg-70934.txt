Feel free to laugh, but I'd appreciate any suggestions for improvements.
Camping ideas are more appreciated than purchasing- as this is the main,
and I don't have a lot of funds.

Tiru, level one Vicar to Brell (dwarf), is wearing:
two Jasper gold earrings +3 WIS
two velium Jasper rings 7 WIS
Black alloy medallion 6AC 6 INT  6 WIS
Platinum Ruby Veil 7STR 7 WIS
Silver threaded bandana (compliments of werewolf invasion) 2AC 1STA 2WIS
5 Mana
Bracer of the Revenant 9AC 5 WIS (the only piece of Cleric armor worth
getting!)
Gauntlets of the Black 15AC 4STR 3WIS
Platinum armband 3STR 3WIS
Polished bone bracer 2AC 3WIS 3INT
Adamite Epaulets 9AC 7WIS
Chestplate of the Constant 20AC 8STA 5SvMagic
Mammoth Hide Cloak 7AC 4WIS 5SvCold
Fine Steel Girdle 9AC
Gatorscale leggings 7AC 4WIS 15 HP
Boots of the Reliant 11AC 6SvDisease
Springwood Club 5WIS 5STR 5INT (who cares what the dam/del ratio is- I'm
not fighting anyway)
Testament of Vanear 10WIS 10 Mana
Small Wisdom Diety 2WIS

That makes my WIS 198. It ought to be over 200. I also ought to have
more resist gear. No I don't have a spare set to swap in and out for
raids. Alll suggestions appreciated.
