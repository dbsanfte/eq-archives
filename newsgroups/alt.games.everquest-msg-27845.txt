Don't forget that shamans only get a worthwhile slow somewhere in the
30s (34?).

And few people picking classes for group will know exactly when they get
it, so sometime when they have it, it will be ignored, and sometimes
they will get a group based on their ability to slow when they can't.

On the other hands probably a majority of 30 something group leaders
these days will be alts, and will be working on assumptions learnt at
level 50+. So they pick a level 30 cleric in FM because every Sebelis
group needs a cleric before it leaves the zone line.

I expect one day we will see people turning down enchanters for groups
in Sebelis because they are not so useful in ToV. Most people are
stupid, and can't comprehend any concept more complicated than Class A
GOOD, Class B BAD.
