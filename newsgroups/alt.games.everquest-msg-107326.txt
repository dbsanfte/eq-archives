Add the following header to your posts:

x-no-archive: yes

It doesn't *have* to be in the headers, but adding it manually to
every one of your posts with it gets old fast, I'd imagine. As for
how to do it in your newsreader, you're on your own...

Well, you don't *have* to give the Feds your usenet address when you
apply, hint, hint...

And remember, Google may be archiving your posts even with that
header, and just choosing not to display them as a courtesy. There's
no law mandating x-no-archive, and they might very well decide to
not honor it in the future...
