Ogre.  No stun from the front is a major plus.  Also if you can get
a friend to start a character with you then you have a
warrior/shaman combo that makes a decent start for a group for many
levels.  You will be able to hunt many levels in Feerott and then
basilisks and Orcs in Rathe mountains.  Myself and 2 friends did
this and never had any competition for hunting.  Faction is not
really that big of deal.  You can head to OT and live from level 16
on if you want.
