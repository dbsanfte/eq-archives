I've seen people doing a slightly more sophisticated scam
on my server.  I first became aware of it when a guildmate
almost fell for it but then smelled something fishy and
backed out.

It works like this:

scammer_01 auctions, "WTS Fungi Tunic"

sucker_00 tells scammer_01, "What are you asking for the Fungi?"

scammer_01 tells you, "15kp, or an Ursa Tresses"

sucker_00 tells scammer_01, "What's an Ursa Tresses?"

scammer_01 tells you, "A rare item I need for a quest"

[five minutes pass]

scammer_02 auctions, "WTS LoB, BoM, FoW, and Ursa Tresses"

sucker_00 tells scammer_02, "How much for the Ursa Tresses?"

scammer_02 tells you, "8kp"

[sucker_00 thinks to himself, "wow, I can buy the U.T. for
8k and swap it for the Fungi, what a deal"]

It was at this point that my guildmate engaged the
two in further conversation and found their stories
not entirely believable, so he backed out.  Good for
him.

"Ursa Tresses" are one of the useless wigs that Ping Fuzzlecutter
sells in the W.FP newbie area, for about 4gp.  The scammers
were going to sucker someone into buying this trash item
for 8kp, then log both mules, leaving the sucker to think,
"darn, where'd that guy who wanted the Ursa Tresses for the
Fungi go?  I'll have to catch him the next time he's
online and complete the trade..."

About a week later I saw someone offering to sell "Lupine
Locks" (another Ping Fuzzlecutter trash item) for 12kp.
When I played innocent and asked him what it was, he
said "quest item".  If I could have tracked down who was
asking for Lupine Locks for an uber item, I'd have /reported
them both, but the first guy logged before I could find
his partner in crime.
