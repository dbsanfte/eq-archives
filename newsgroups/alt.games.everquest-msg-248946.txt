One of the biggest problems in the US is that the population density is a 
lot lower in general than most of Europe.  The good news is that there 
are several projects in the customer test phase running broadband 
internet through the power lines.  In Cincinatti there is an active test 
ongoing right now of one such system.  If this is successful, which is 
looking very promising right now, then rural areas will finally have a 
reasonable alternative for broadband.  It is currently price competative 
with DSL and cable.
