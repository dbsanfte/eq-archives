That's not as paradoxical as you make it sound.  The less time
I have to play, the more camping I do.  For example, I camped
Hadden (with his 5.5 hour, more or less, respawn time) when
I was working heavily on a project for a deadline.  I had no
time to spend glued to the computer on a group raid, but I
sure as heck had time to park my Paladin at the Hadden camp
and then work for five hours straight, taking a half hour
break to eat and watch for Hadden to spawn, then kill him,
note the time, and go back to work for another five hours...

Conversely, I'd have been bored out of my skull trying to
camp Hadden if I actually had the time to play all day.

Even faster respawn camps can be done during times when
your RL obligations prevent you from being in front of the
computer continuously.
