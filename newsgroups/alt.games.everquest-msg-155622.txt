If you are level one, you won't get any XP grouped with a level
6 or higher... but the reverse (which you suggest) is not true.

Or if it is, its some very limited special case.  I can certainly say
that a level 20 will not get exp with a level 32, but the 32 will
still get exp.  Lower levels don't get exp, but higher levels
always do, unless its for killing a mob thats green to the higher
level.

Another possibility is that for some reason, what you say
is accurate, but only for exp off quests.  Here too, though
I'd guess you are wrong, since I've grouped with higher
level druid, done a handin, and not gotten exp, but she
did... then we remembered that she was 60 and I was
30, and we'd forgotten to disband.
