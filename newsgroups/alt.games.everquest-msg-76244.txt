Because we might get pissed and God-forbid say something when someone throws
a damage root on one of the mobs we might be quad'n?  Not a flame just
wondering where you get that impression of druids.  My little guy likes to
heal and buff people and watch VERY closely any mobs I wish to engage,
unlike some other idiots who see you being chased by a very close pack of 4
mobs as you're raining down death and destruction, and then think it funny
to toss a low dmg root in on a couple of them.

I think that Druids aren't the only ones in, nor the *majority* of, the
'screw everyone else' club bucko.

You sound jealous??  I quad when I feel like it unless the zone is loaded,
then I just go do something else.  That's been my experience anyway with the
other higher level druids on Brell that I encounter, YMMV.
