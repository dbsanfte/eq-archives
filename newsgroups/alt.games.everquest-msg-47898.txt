My cleric has finally hit the 200 wisdom mark with one point to spare.  This
being the end result of weeks of gear hunting and partly as a break from
being every group's mana sponge.  Now back to leveling as fast as I can to
49th level for the next resurrection spell.

However, I'd like some thoughts on what I should now be looking for in the
way of gear for my cleric.  The following is my current stats (all unbuffed)

I've been told that I should now work on building up my resistances.
Haven't looked into this much.  Also know that to do so now will require
more thought as I don't want to go below 200 wisdom so I'll probably need
some slots with more wisdom boost to afford other slots with less or none.
So what do people here recommend?
