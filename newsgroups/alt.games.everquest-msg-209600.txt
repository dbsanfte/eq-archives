Stonebrunt if you can get the chanter there. The down side is the only place
you can zone is The Warrens. You will end up running to the other side of
the zone and logging to get rid of aggro a lot. The kitty village will do
nothing to help you except for Kobolds and don't like wolf form or you
attacking their cats.

The pandas there are serious undercons and will tear through most other
mobs.

There are at least two good quests there, Wak of the Frozen Skies and
Swiftclaw Sash. There is also a 30ish level NPC SK that pops occasionally
and drops a SK only sword that is pretty good.
