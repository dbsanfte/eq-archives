Some factors that could be involved:

1. The level difference.  This would be insignificant--giving a variation of
around a percent in how the XP is split.  Furthermore, this would be
completely countered by you needing less XP to level than he does, so the
level difference is not the direct cause of what you saw.

2. Class bonuses.  Warrior and Rogue get a bonus.  This would be a bigger
effect than the level difference, but still swamped by the difference in the
amount of XP each of you need for a level, and so this too is not the cause
of what you saw.

3. Racial penalties.  Like class bonuses, probably not the cause here.

4. AAXP.  There are two ways this could account for what you saw.

4A. Perhaps you had some of your XP set to go to AAXP, but were looking only
at the regular XP bar, and so were underreporting?

4B. Perhaps he had his XP going to AAXP, and that 10% he reported was on the
AAXP bar, not the regular bar?  Filling the AAXP bar is equivalent to
something like filling the level 51 regular XP bar, and if you are above 51,
then with an even split of XP between the two of you, if he was working on
AAXP and you on regular, then he'd see his AAXP bar go much faster than
you'd see your regular XP bar move.

5. PEBKAC on his part (or your part).
