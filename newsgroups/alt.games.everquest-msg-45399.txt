I've jsut been a cleric for 51 levels, and have noticed this a LOT.
Never had any AE heals not give faction, but rarely use them. I have
had complete heal not give faction, many times. And expessially in
Kael. Used it most there btw.

I'n my experience Celestial heal will hardly ever give faction, and in
places like The Hole where most things are dubious to me, I've celes
healed someone hacking on an elemental, con the elemental and its
STILl dubious.  I thought this was a feature.

Conversely, if you've been a cleric for 91 levels, I'm sure you've had
the MEGA aggro, from a supieor or even a greater heal before. One that
they can't get it off of you at all.  Maybe its random.
