Would it matter? As soon as they put a real world value on ingame
items, it raises a whole slew of complicated questions. ... especially
when gambling becomes involved.

I honestly couldn't care less if you bought the boots from Yantis. The
problem (for me) comes in when the company deciding on things like
drop rates and item stats has a monetary interest in those questions. 

Anyone who believes Sony could stay unbiased and not make decisions
based on how much money they can generate from item sales has a whole
lot more faith in corporate America than I do.

Of course in the next expansion, there will be a push to decrease the
number of no-drop items because the 'player auctions' division of Sony
wants to generate some extra revenue.

You have a helluva lot more faith in SOE than I do <g>.
