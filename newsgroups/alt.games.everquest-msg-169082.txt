I made the same upgrade, gf2 mx 400 64 meg to GF4 ti 4200 128 meg. 
However, I did not notice a huge improvement in EQ. I still lagged
enough in the bazaar that I went back to old models. With the old
models I was moving GREAT though and I moved well with old or new in
the jaggedpine zone (which previously bogged me. 

The largest difference is I play at 1024 x 768 with some antialiasing
at 32 bit, while still being faster. I run the luclin models BETTER
with this card but the slowdown they cause, especially in the bazaar,
makes the purchase of the card seem goofy. I hate those pauses too
when a new person enters the zone. So its back to old models for me
anyway. I wish they could have just built the engine originally so it
scaled so that you could have the same models but with more polygons
and no further texture/image concerns. Luckily newer mmorpgs will be
doing this so that when you have a geforce FX mach 39 in 2 years the
game should scale well. 

You don't notice that big of a diff in EQ though since its some cruddy
old engine and is not optimized for the acceleration that the new card
has or the load it is made to take off of the proc. Instead, you are
mostly just seeing a frame rate benefit. 

I got in Anarchy online after this, the difference in there was
amazing. Its a newer product so makes better use of the newer powers
of a card. Star wars Galaxies should be even more dramatic.
