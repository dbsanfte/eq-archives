So you can keep playing a continual subscription product, like any
continuing subscription service. Try asking your power company or
cable company why you should continue to pay their fees when they
don't install some fusion reactor in your house or add a new channel
every day.

AAHAHA I honestly did not see that coming.

I wish it were that simple. Instead they have to use it to pay the
saleries of over 70 full time employees, pay for continual development
of the game, pay the rent of the building, pay all the huge bandwith
costs and then have what little profit their likely is left over so
that it seems like the project should continue.
