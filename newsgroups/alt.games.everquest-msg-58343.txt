Yes, Ensnare, sorry, I meant "snare" as a generic rather than "Snare" as
the name of a spell in the snare line.  Ensnare is worlds better than snare,
slows em down a little more, lasts till the mob dies, faster cast (which
matters on a resist) and really doesn't cost anything at all by the time you
get it.

Why not a nuke and have done with it?

Of course they do.  Go smack an Avocet (well, this would work if they
weren't all green to you) and then walk him past his buddies, assuming
you aren't far too high level for them every aviak you get near will join
in the fight.  Yet kill him without getting close to any of them and you'll
find that not one aviak will rustle a feather at your presence.  Heck,
you can probably even buy from Krak up top in the penthouse.

Most mobs in EQ have a Frenzy component to em, increasing their
aggro range and/or altering their faction reaction to you if they get
close enough to a mob you are fighting that has the same faction.

The Lull line and the Harmony line are specifically designed to combat
this tendancy, lull line sucks, harmony is great, but both function by
reducing the "hearing" range of the targets.
