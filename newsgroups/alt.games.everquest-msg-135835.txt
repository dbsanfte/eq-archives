I have not the time and you do have a public library do you not. You may
want to see my previous post. I gave you a list of  books to read. It may
give you some perspective on why things occur rather than just saying well
it was all the US fault they just did that to show their ass. Oh yes and go
read about the "boat people" too.
I do prefer to read than spend my time trying to educate a knothead like
you.

The only  thing more I find more appalling than your ignorance is your
arrogance.
