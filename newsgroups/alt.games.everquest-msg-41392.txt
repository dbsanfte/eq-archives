So does that mean we should do nothing?

It's very simple.  This scumbag, this sub-human *thing*, has plotted
for months to kill thousands of innocent people, purely because they
live in a country whose policies he doesn't like.  He is completely
devoid of the ordinary decency supposedly inspired by civilization or,
ironically, any religion, including Islam.

For some who have committed acts of violence, I do not advocate the
death penalty.  For others, I most certainly do.  I think being a mass
murderer of necessity places one in the latter group.

I want him dead.  Whether others arise to take his place is
immaterial.  He did this, and he should pay.

I hope there's little danger of that.  While Afghanistan should not,
IMO, get away unscathed for harboring bin Laden, it is a poor,
ravaged, desperate country and I certainly don't advocate any damage
to the civilians there.  The government is another matter.

I also hope that, if it turns out that bin Laden has been financed by,
say, Iraq, that Saddam's regime will be made to pay in some way.
