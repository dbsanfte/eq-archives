If d) is allowed, then tradeskilling is a good way to make money; there 
are all sorts of combines which you can sell to players for money.  You 
can't make real money selling spiderling silks to vendors.

Also note that spiderling silks are only valuable inasmuch as 
tradeskillers want them in order to work on trade skills.  So for d) to 
be a viable way to make money, the trade skill system is one on which 
you can make money (even if its not by actually having any skill of your 
own)
