Hehe yes those 10 seconds can seem awfully long =)

Generally only on heavy tanks (the ones that wear plate =)

As late as possible =)

If you heal more than 1200 hp with it, yes. As you level up further CHeal
will become a necessity for tanks; no other healing will keep a 4k+hp tank
anywhere near alive.

The thing to do to learn CHeal timing for the first time (and indeed in any
new situation) is to watch the health bar. I'm guessing you're probably used
to that =) When the fight is in progress, count to 10 slowly and watch how
far the tank's health drops in that time. 10 seconds is long enough to
smooth out any erratic fluctuations in mob output, so you can be pretty sure
that for THAT fight, that 10 second drop in health will always be about the
same.

Suppose the tank's health drops 2 bubs in 10 seconds. Now you know when to
start your CHeal - when the tank's health is at 2 bubs plus <a bit>. This
will maximise your CHeal efficiency while not taking a huge risk. Although
it can be fun to hit them while they are in the purple, they tend to moan if
it happens too often =) The appropriate value of <a bit> depends on lag, the
likelihood of adds, and how much you trust your timing.

As far as aggro goes, in a single mob fight it won't be a problem if you
wait until the appropriate moment - by then the melee will have all the
hate. In a multi-mob fight though, even if the adds are messed they WILL see
what you did, and WILL hate you for it. Typically not as much as they hate
the ench, but it's important to be aware. In a multi-mob fight with no crowd
control... good luck =)

Congratulations on getting the spell that defines EQ, btw =) (pet theory of
mine)
