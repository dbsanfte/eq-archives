Bandits in GFay do start out indifferent, but they're on Fizzlethorpe
faction.

I made an unpleasant discovery about derv thugs and their outlook on
everyone as I ran through Dorn's camp with 1 bubble of health last
night... my SK wanted to see how Dorn conned, but the thug decided to
make mincemeat of her instead... at least none of the other dervs
tried to help him so I almost made it to zone :) (most annoying thing
was losing all my sweet shaman buffs)
