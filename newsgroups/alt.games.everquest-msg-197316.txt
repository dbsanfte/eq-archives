Hello All;

The following is an excellent suggestion. I'm a new player (since January).
I have a 42 Cleric and a 15 shammy. If my Cleric dies in a really bad spot
(and I sure have done that). Then, if I understand the below suggestion, I
can consent my shammy, log and use it to pull my cleric to a safe spot for
rezzing.  My shammy has Levitate. Can you drag a corpse if you are
levitating and say, drag it over water or lava, or off of mountain tops and
across to other mountain top??

Thanks in advance for these great suggestions. It really helps new players
learn the "tricks".
