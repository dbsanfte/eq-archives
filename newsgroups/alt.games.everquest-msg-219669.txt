Well, in the case of Uber it's quite possible many just didn't see the 
post.  You can change the size of the viewport, but, as I understand it, 
it does not change your field of view.  I have not played with it myself, 
so I can't say from experience.  The command, if you want to see what it 
does do, is /viewport I think.  type /help in game, and look for the 
command.
