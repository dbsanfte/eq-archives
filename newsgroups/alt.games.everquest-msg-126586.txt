One thing to add to this, in Hebrew, unlike English, it is quite obvious
from the word, as written in Hebrew, that it is "female
poisoner/witch/sorceress".  In English, poisoner does not imply that in any
way.  So, from this, can we conclude, that only a female, who is whichever
of these translations you choose to use, should be put to death?  It is of
course still not acceptable for a man to poison someone, but, there does not
appear to be a call to put him to death if he does, unless the poisoned
person dies, then you can invoke an eye for an eye.
