Ok, you seem to be confused with what SOE are saying and what they are
actually doing.
Let me clarify, SOE say "We have made to grouping more beneficial to
encourage social interraction...blah..blah..MMORGP..blah..blah"
What they mean is "The servers still appear to be crowded because players
flock to the same zones, we have made Grouping more attractive in an attempt
to cut down some of the arguements over spawns and maybe encourage ppl to
seek out other hunting spots other than Paludal Caverns and DSP"

SOE are not trying to hinder anyones game play or style thereof, they are
trying to smoothe out some of the grief that is caused by Human Nature
Online(tm) which of course is generally far different from Human Nature Real
Life(tm)

The roleplay element for EQ is down to the individual, even on FV at least
half the players aren't there to RP only to play on a fresh server.

I don't have too many hopes for SWG, I don't expect it to be far different,
after a year, than EQ all raid encounters and uber guilds. Will probably
hold out for EQ2 and give City of Heroes a shot as that might be fun,
although seeing half the players on a server trying to recreate Wolverine
will be tedious.
