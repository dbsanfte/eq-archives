I appreciate you candor Paul.

I do felt they blew their wad this wave on the attack as well.

I still think there are many sleepers here now.

I think there will be many retaliations and events to come.

I won't fool myself into believing there won't be.

The recent reports are 25% of American Mosques could be housing terrorists
or sleepers.

I know this is over the top, but I can't accept the next 5-10 years will be
without events.

My post here is not about in the next month, it's about the rest of your
life...

It's about making a plan...

If you have a nuclear facility, know where it is, know wher you will go,
just as you should know where to go if your house catches on fire.

Be prepared as best you can, food, water, whatever, doesn't hurt to have a
piece of mind. Who knows how long emergency services could get to you if
something does happen.

Gas masks, what's wrong with owning them? Nothing, it's prudent. Highly
unlikely you will use them but again a piece of mind. Look at Israel when
Saddam was firing Scuds...

It's like having a fire extinguisher... Being a boyscout... It's all about
being prepared, and hoping you never ever have to use it. But sadly, I
strongly believe many people will in the next ten years. If it's not this
year, it's next, if it's not next, it's the one after, etc.. It's not if,
it's when sadly.
