Yes.

Minor inconvenience.  When he leaves to get the next pull, the monk
continues to DPS.

He doesn't have V3 haste until Luclin...

In order to split, the monk has to lay on the ground.  It can take
quite a long time to get a single back to camp.  When the bard does it,
he pacifies everything and pulls one.  Done.  He has a single in the
camp right when he wishes it to arrive.  Does the monk even have his
single-target pac?  Even if so, an overpull by a monk means a feign and
more foot tapping.  An overpull by a bard means the bard just mezzes
one, kites one, snares one, charms one, etc...

Not only are bards better pullers--even without fade--than monks,
rangers are better pullers as well.  There are exceptions to this, but
in most situations a well-played ranger will net a group far more exp
and loot than a well-played monk.

Defeat Kerafim?  That's not possible for level 60's, I don't think.
You are supposed to lose.  Or did they change the encouter?

Yeah, get him a few HP buffs. =)

You can kinda guestimate based on whether he is green or LB to you.

Exactly.

Yep, yep.

Natural limitations on pet pulling which often make it unreasonable for
everyday pulling...

Do SKs get sight graft?  This is very useful as well...

Also this makes your feign pulling a little less painful.  If you are
laying on the ground, no big deal.  If the monk is laying on the
ground, that a lot more DPS lost.

Yeah CD is something like a 30% reduction in movement speed.  Engulfing
is only 40%.  But Dooming is as much as 60%.  I would either keep two
snares loaded or be ready to quickly load dooming if you think you are
going to need to split.  On my necro, in his mid levels, I regularly
kept two snares loaded (engulfing and dooming).  I mostly did this,
however, for when I had to snare an unsnared, agroed mob.  The higher
level snares lower movement rate more but they also take much longer to
cast.  When you are kiting and trying to snare, that 2 second cast time
(versus 3 or longer) is appreciated.

Engulfing is generally a good snare though it doesnt last as long as
dooming, if I recall, and the movement rate mod is only 40% as I
pointed out earlier.  If you are kiting or splitting, dooming might be
better.  This depends on your mana I gues.  Also, once you get 61,
Festering Darkess has a resist mod that makes it a bit easier to apply.

Not quite sure what is happening here.  You have direct agro on the one
you feared, obviously, so it should be getting friends.  Perhaps the
mobs are just so spread out and being killed so often by others that
you have been lucky so far?

Harmo, SoW, bind sight, wolf form (to see through walls), snare, and of
course, track...he isn't exactly useless.  However you are still often
going to be better than the ranger when pulling for a raid.

One other trick to keep in mind: a bow allows you to get out of LOS
before you actually agro.  Very useful for chain casters...
