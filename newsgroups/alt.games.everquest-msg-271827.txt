Another thought is that the speech in EQ had evolved around and in the
game. Of course someone would have learned the basics of this when
grouping and *talking* to other people. Mentioning everywhere that some
of the eq specific terms aren't explained in faqs, websites whatever is
poor. After all you did figure out what temperance or SoW are.

FAQ stands for frequently asked questions and I can't see a single point
making this an 'all questions ever asked' list.
