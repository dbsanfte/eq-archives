Taken out of context it's very hard to make a judgement on the
wisdom or cowardice of his decision. However it is undeniably true
that a caster without mana is pretty useless. If the situation is
do dire that there is no chance of getting in some ticks of med,
and fleeing is possible, then why would you not do so?

Another element is how much the classes can do in low mana situations.
A mez spell is pretty cheap to cast, doesn't have AoE taunt and can
make a *huge* difference in how a battle turns out. On the other hand
healing is expensive, has an AoE taunt and won't make that much
difference. If the fighter is getting pounded on, and the cleric has
a good idea of how fast the red bar is bleeding points, then a single
last heal probably won't make a difference.

In addition an enchanter has some tools that may allow him to survive
the attention of one, or even more, mobs. A cleric has only one, root,
which isn't so reliable.

That said my lowbie cleric (L17) doesn't gate out. That's mana that
could be used for a heal. But if the zone is close i'm not above
casting DA and running for it. At higher levels, where the mana for
a gate is irrelevant to the mana needed for a heal, that might change.
