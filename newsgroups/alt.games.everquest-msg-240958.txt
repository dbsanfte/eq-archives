Your card should be fine. Cards made 2 years ago should be fine.

Run directX diagnostics... dxdiag.exe

Go to the display tab, and make sure directdraw and directx are
enabled. Turn on the AGP texture one too if its off.  Run the tests.

If the tests are successful, try EQ again.
If the tests aren't it may give us a clue why...

Good luck...
