Same old argument...from a druid's perspective, I wonder if those same
people who DEMAND Sow, Rez, etc, immediately and for no profit would be so
willing to spend, say the same 5 minutes it will take me to regain that
mana, in killing a mob to almost half for me so I can benefit from their
time?  Probably not.  As someone else already stated, when I do a gate while
grouped, I split the money with the group, as it is their time too...I also
wonder why all those who think we are at their disposal to gate, sow, rez,
didn't play a cleric or druid or wizzie to begin with if they wanted
immediate, free access to such spells?
