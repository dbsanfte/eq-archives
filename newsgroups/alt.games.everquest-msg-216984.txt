Having seen the price of dedicated game servers from companies like
gameservers and gamehosting, I'm wondering how many people here play
on, or pay for their own server ?

I'm looking at setting up a dedicated facility for onling gaming,
where gamers can setup and play any online game they like (as long as
it runs as a dedicated server under linux!)

Ball park pricing would be considerably cheaper than what I've found,
at around $100 a month for a 20 max user server.

We're talking serious server spec, 3gb P4, 1gb ram, plenty of hard
disc space for additional maps and mods.

It would only take 4 sign ups to get the server off the ground.

If you're interested, and don't want to keep paying the $150-$200+
dollars a month you're already paying, then email me at

gameservers@[spamremove]k00l.net

Thanks.
