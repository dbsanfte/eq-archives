Enchanters work well with most any class. If you are trying to play
together,
pick some sort of melee character or a cleric.
Melee suggestion: Beastlord, Monk, Paladin
Melee is preferred because an enchanter's pet isnt the best tank. But
chanters
rock when they buff the tank. If you choose Beastlord, you get one of the
best
pets, a great melee, some minor healing, and extra buffing.
