 This happened to us but we didn't do it on purpose. He warped, fluxed
some people out into the lava and then warped to chase them. He
eventually ended up at Aarys spot. It was late after the CR so we said
screw it and left him there.

 Probably one of the gimpy triplets. Before Verant decided to be
annoying and upgrade the HP by probably at least double. Still the same
easy fight, just takes twice as long now.
