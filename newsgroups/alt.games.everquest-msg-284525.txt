	Ummmm, what's the big deal?  Block everything from the outside,
allow anything that originates from the inside, and allow anything
from the the outside associated with an existing connection... 

	Or don't even worry about fancy firewall rules.  Just NAT
your internal network.  Firewalls won't stop worms and such because
they all operate on known ports like IRC.  All that ZoneAlarm type
stuff does is make you click windows 100 times a day.  Practicing good
hygiene and running a good antivirus scanner will do a thousand times
more to protect you than pesky Windows firewalls will.

	So turn it off! :-)
