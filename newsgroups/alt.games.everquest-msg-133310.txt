> Anyone got any good eq cheats they can share?

1.  Go to East Commons

2.  /ooc Looking for port/gate to Cazic Thule

3.  Wait for a response.  You may have to pay 50pp, but do it, it's worth
it.

4.  Make sure to remove all your gear and unmem all your spells before you
get ported.  If you don't have room in your inventory, just drop them on the
ground; you'll soon be compensated.

5.  After you get ported, *walk* (don't run or the mobs will aggro you)
through the maze.

If you've done the above, platinum pieces will slowly become visible along
the floor of the maze.  You have thirty seconds to grab them before they
fade out again.  After thirty seconds, walk (don't run!) back to the pyramid
to reactivate the cheat.

You can make 1-2k an hour doing this.

Shh... don't tell Verant.
