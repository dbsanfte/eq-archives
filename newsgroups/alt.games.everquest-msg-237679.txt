	IMHO the problem was lack of communication rather than poor
technique.  Aggro kiting an add around is perfectly cool, but the ranger
thought you were running away and defaulted to pull mob from caster mode.
Which is impossible to do if the caster won't stand still :-)

	Either one or both of telling your group you'll be aggro
kiitng adds and/or a hot key to the effect of "Aggro kiting %t add!!"
might be a solution.
