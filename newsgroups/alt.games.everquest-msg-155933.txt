For those of you using custom skins

If you are using a custom interface and are encountering problems with it, 
you may need update this file: 

Equi_animations.xml 

We added the following new animations: 

a_checkboxnormal
a_checkboxpressed 

Custom interfaces will need to be updated to incorporate these changes. 
Until then, you may need to copy the EQUI_animations.xml file into the 
directory for your custom skin.
