I know the time will come when I cannot solo effectively, but at 22, I
haven't quite hit it yet.  I can still take down blues most of the time,
some whites as well.  Yes, I have to bandage up and sit on my butt for quite
some time afterwards.  I do have to be careful about what I pick on,
something that I can outrun is preferable, or I fight close to a zone line.
My shaman is easier to solo, as I can outrun just about anything with him,
and kiting removes almost all elements of danger in the fight.
