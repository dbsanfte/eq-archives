Very impressive, however i believe the wyverns are around lvl 45?  correct
me if i am wrong however.  To be honest i cant really say how well a ranger
would solo in CS, ive never seen it done.  but still even if the ranger can
kill one wyvern per minute surely aftwerwards he would have to heal himself,
then med to full? please correct me if i am wrong. Would this not put the
ranger far behind the quad kiting wizard?

wizard:
round up and kill 4 wyverns in 1 minute.
Med for 3-4 minutes to recover the lost mana.
at the end of this period go kill another 4 in 1 minute.

Ranger:
find and kill 1 wyvern in 1 minute (assuming he can)
heal and med up for the next 2 minutes maybe? (i really cant say how long
this would take, please correct it)
Kill another wyvern in 1 minute

If my speculations are correct, surely that would put the Wizard way ahead
of the ranger.  Please feel free to correct me on the ranger soloing part of
this as my experience with ranger soloing is not all that great i will
happily admit.
