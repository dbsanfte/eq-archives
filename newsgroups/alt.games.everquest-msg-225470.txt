Having been on many LDoN runs with this cleric/warrior pair, I was 
perfectly happy to agree when they said they wanted to try it as a trio 
tonight.

We drew a slaughter 51, having rejected a rescue (this pair normally 
won't reject anything, but this was an experiment)

We were about to run off to start when I noticed I had a blinking heart 
in my songs box... called them back and we buffed in the camp instead, 
so we had that AE mana and hp feed to get us started quicker.

We also taught each other languages to pass the little down time faster; 
I'd discovered they didn't speak gnome, and they did know elder elvish 
which I didn't have yet.

Soon enough we were off... and I promptly went LD on the way.  Came back 
and joined them at the entrance, slapped DS on the warrior, and we 
zoned... where I went LD a second time.  Popped back in, summoned pet 
and threw it into the fight they'd already started.

 From there the LD bug didn't rear its ugly head again, but it was 
certainly the most fearful thing; without me they had a hard time 
killing anything, without the cleric we'd have a hard time surviving 
anything, and without the warrior we'd almost certainly be crushed by 
whatever we faced... he's probably the most disposable of the trio, 
though, at least we could use the pet as a substitute and get thru the 
one mob we were facing, or both gate out.  Three man leaves little 
margin indeed for LDs.

At first we were working like we did with a full group; I used mana 
sparingly, one nuke per kill more or less, and only burned heavy on the 
odd multiple pull.  What this meant, though,was that we kept having to 
rest due to cleric mana running out.

Gradually, we learned to adapt; she started eating her mod rod every 
time it cycled up, and I started nuking heavy all the time.  My mana bar 
dipped south, dropping down to as low as 20m and still pulling, then I'd 
call a halt and chain pet canni back up to FM to start again.  Cleric, 
in the meantime, would go from 20m to 40m in the same time.  We stuck to 
  minimal lull pulling but definately getting singles as much as 
possible, and ran the warrior's HP down to 10% before CHeals hit, no 
other heals at all; in fact the cleric's health gradually ran down to 
30% as her mana was the biggest choke point and she'd get hit here or 
there, or a trap would do a bit of damage, or those mod rods she was 
consuming gradually wore away at her.  My HP on the other hand stayed 
full, because I cast Phantom Armor on myself, have Regen 2 AA, and am 
better at avoiding getting hit and follow the two of them around looking 
for trap graphics when on the move; generally you can get around the 
traps once you see them go off.

I doubled or even tripled my nuke Damage per mob kill, and the cleric 
picked up at least 15% extra healing per cast by waiting longer on the 
Cheal, while the warrior got better at single pulls without lull (we did 
lull a good deal, but I'd say half as much as usual) and making sure my 
pet was behind the mob... plus he developed a good habit of backing off 
from the mob when very low on HP; rooting pet meant he could avoid death 
fairly readily.  My poor pet never recieved a heal from me or the 
cleric, if he got hurt bad I'd reward him by killing him; we can rebuild 
him, we can make him better than he was!

We blew thru that 51 slaughter with 15 minutes to spare, and then spent 
the bonus half hour killing still more mobs.  Same LDoN points as a full 
group (I got 15), about the same exp too somehow, twice the cash, and 
splitting the augments that dropped was easy with one melee, one healer, 
one caster.

But we love a challenge, and for that this was a lot of fun
