Yes.

That's correct. Only one controllable 'pet' at a time.

Oh its much worse than that, because you see, charm has a very random
duration, it could last 10 minutes or 10 seconds. You never know when it
will break. When it does break you will have, not one, but TWO angry mobs
that will be eager to make a wishbone out of you. Because the charmed
mob wants your blood for charming it and the mob you attacked will suddenly
forget about your former pet and will come directly for you. Fun eh?

Charm is awesome when it works, but it SUUUUUCKS when it doesn't.
Its definitely an exciting way to fight though. =)
