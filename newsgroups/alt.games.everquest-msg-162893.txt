The seal that you get back from the handin where you get your third shawl is
subtly different from the one you handed in.

What IS possible is for person A to do shawls one and two and then get his seal,
happily use it till he gets an upgrade range slot item, then help someone else
MQ the third shawl with it.

The stats on the seal are quite nice, and for many classes an upgrade to range
slot may be a long time in the future.  If you aren't going to wear the third
shawl or do the 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th shawl quests, then there's no reason to
actually get the third shawl, and you can save someone else the irritating hunt
for show griffin eggs (and the heartbreak of a failed baking roll or two!)
