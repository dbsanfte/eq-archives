killing these sisters will make you KOS in Kelethin and Felwith - do you
really want that? If you are an evil race already its no probs, but if you a
good race you need to think hard.
You can restore this faction by feeding muffins to a NPC in Freeport, but
that as long as you dont drop too low.

Also at level 17 they will had your arse back to you on a plate. You would
want to be late 20s to early 30s for these gals.
