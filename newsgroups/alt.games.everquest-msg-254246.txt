Umm, so A spends 30K, gets dinged 7.5K, while B spends 50K, gets dinged
12.5K  The guy who spends more pays more taxes.

No.  Two people who spend the same amount should have the same tax bill, not
two people who have the same lifestyle.  And obviously from your example
above person B doesn't have the same lifestyle as person A; instead he's
spending over his limit.

I think if they're going to go with that rule, they're begging for the exact
same tax complications as currently exist, where tax accountants spend their
time finding loopholes whereby something can be slid from taxable to
untaxable.

Again, it isn't an income tax, it's a sales tax.  You buy something, you pay
sales tax on what you just bought.  You say that people won't be taxed on
their vacations?  I say you're not thinking about it.  Other countries
*will* tax sales.  The only difference will be *which country gets the tax*.
You'll still be paying taxes on what you spend.  This does not provide any
advantage to the wealthy; they get taxed on their purchases exactly as you
do, no matter where they go, no matter where you go.

This is not something that would be added up at the end of the year, with a
bill of "pay this amount".  This is something that would be paid on a
purchase-by-purchase basis, exactly as every other sales tax.
