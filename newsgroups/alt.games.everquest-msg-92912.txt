Wait until level 10 or about and journey from the Karanas, pass High Keep
and head towards Freeport.  Be warned.  It's dangerous and DO NOT enter
Kithicor woods at night!  Do /time to see if it is daytime in Norrath when
you enter.  After Kiticor woods head to Freeport and get a bind.  Then go
hunt the Orc Highway in the Oasis until 20 or 25 =).  After you do that you
can start Journeying to S.Ro then head to Lower Guk in innothule swamp or
one of those swamps around Grobb.  Another warning.  DO NOT kill live frogs,
only undead ones and stick close to the zone.  There is an exp bonus in
Lower Guk also.  Hope this helps.  PS.  Arrows are useless.  you can sell
bows to other rangers and such but, for the miniscule damage... I don't see
the point in wasting time.
