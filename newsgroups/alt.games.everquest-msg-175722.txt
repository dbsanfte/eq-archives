    Create an ogre warrior with max STA, then create another race of warrior
with 100 starting STA. Compare HPs. It isn't just at higher levels that it
makes a difference.

    And I always thought that the formula held for all levels of warrior,
but Magelo seems to disagree with me for my 47 WAR. I'd be curious to know
level ranges on HPs/STA.
