Others have answered.  Since you haven't done any quests yet I'm guessing
that you're new to the game.  There shouldn't be very many (if any) that are
broken that you have to worry about.  Quite honestly, there aren't very many
broken at ALL, and there are hundreds of quests available.  The chances of
ANYONE hitting a broken quest are pretty slim.
