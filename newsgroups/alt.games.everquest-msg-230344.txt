While I'm on the subject of stupid questions, if I switch the 3D sky on 
everything blurs stupidly, but only against the sky, see?  Obviously it 
don't do it if I turn the 3D sky off again, so that's the first solution, 
but is there some way for me t' see all them pretty clouds without having 
bizarre cacti?

It's my opinion, is all.
No, I'm not qualified.  No, I don't know everything.
No, I probably haven't got all the facts.
And yes, you probably *are* better than me.
Believe me, I can live with it.
