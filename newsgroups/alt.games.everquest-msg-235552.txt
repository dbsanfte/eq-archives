Go out and look for it where you died. If you don't remember, you have
a couple options:

1) Buy a Chipped Bone Rod and right-click on it in the zone you died
in while you have yourself targetted. It'll point you in the direction
of the corpse.
2) Try to get a bard, Shadowknight, or Necromancer to help you find it
with their locate corpse spell/song.
3) If you're one of the above classes, use the spell/song yourself.

If you're under level 10, there's no need to worry about finding your
corpse. All your gear respawns with you. Once you hit level 10, it
stays on your corpse and you need to return to it to recover the gear.

Quick question: Why didn't you start a new topic instead of replying
to a thread that had absolutely no relation (beyond being about EQ) to
your question?
