Hey everyone, this is one of my first posts on this board.  I've read a lot
of your comments and find a lot of it quite interesting.

    I just bought the EQ Trilogy pack and installed it on my comp.  It
usually plays fine but every now and then, people start "floating"  I know
this isn't a spell as it happens with entire zones.

    Another problem is that during character creation, I click to select a
face and get a reddish brown mass in the window instead of the characters
face.  As well, I took my first boat ride tonight and I seemed to get a
fragmentation graphic problem, where in any view except 3rd person from far
away I couldn't see anything but different texture map chunks floating
around at random angles.

    Any tips or suggestions??
I'm running an ATI Radeon 7500 card on a 1GHz Thunderbird system with 256
Megs of ram.
