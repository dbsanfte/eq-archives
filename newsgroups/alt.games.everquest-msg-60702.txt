ok here's the trick buddy.

I do Raptors, I'm a 54 almost 55 wizard on TZ, been doing Raptors
since I was 51.
A lot of people tell me I should have been at Wyverns for 51-54, but I
play on Tallon Zek , and CS is lighty owned ( I play a DE wiz) so I
had to learn how to quad raptors at a young age. 

Now Quad kiting before 51 when you get piller of frost is tougher to
do, with your pre 50's spell arsenal your mana/damage ratio for ae's
isn't very good. Once you get 51 though the mana/damage ratio of
piller of frost is outstanding. Some Basic tactics for all quading is
to have a Staff of Temp Flux and t-boots as you said you have, or
jboots. Staff of TF is Awesome for pulling on the run. My basic
strategy is to pull using the staff, making sure I hit each mob I am
pulling with it. Not only does that get them chasing me but it lowers
their FR/CR making my spells do full most of the time. now the tricky
thing is to get them all snared at the same time, what you gotta do is
run em in circles till you feel they are close enough together that it
will hit em all, then run a ways ahead of them and snare em. Resists
here really screw ya up and are a huge pain in the arse. You also want
to make sure they are not too close because if you bof yourself you
are really screwed. (in my case its impossible to snare myself because
of my MR, but from what I understand this is a problem on blue
servers). Good thing is though once you get Shackles its not resisted
as much as BoF is, and it lasts longer and makes em a tad slower. Its
a great upgrade. Make sure you got skin of some kind on, you will
sometimes take some blows when your rounding em up. 

Now other mobs that are possible agro is another problem as you
stated. Doing Wyverns you just take em down to the beach, Raptors are
a bit tougher, but you can learn the patterns its not really that
hard.
I hope I answered some of your questions. As for my advice, personally
I would hold off on quading till your 51+, its doable, just a lot of
risk involved with running oom etc...

Good hunting, and good luck, let me know how it goes.
