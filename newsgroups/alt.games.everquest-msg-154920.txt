My guild is mostly 50+ and lately the new members are asking us for their
epics.  Not fun.  I've had to post a couple times about people playing their
dues.

If you want to get your epic, don't even bother asking for multi-group help
on one of your fights until you've helped 3-5 other people with theirs.
Otherwise you look greedy and no guild will want you.

What Darkensolo says is right...what do YOU bring to the guild?  If you
don't improve the guild they won't want you.
