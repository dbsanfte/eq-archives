actually no they cant . Television( and all other airwave media ) are not
considered by our beloved goverment as speech.  The goverment is wrong of
course in this but has had support from our courts on the subject.

Congress also recently passed a political "reform" bill that has as its
center piece that no one can comment on an election in the 30 days prior to
it. It is a blatant restriction of free speech. The courts will strike this
one down soon but it was still embarassing that they will need to.
