But of course that's your whole job, that's everyone's whole job, to
make sure that the group survives and the mob doesn't.

The question is, does you slow contribute more to keeping Joe Tank
alive than an HP or AC buff?  Or rather, will the increased mana spent
on slows over the course of an evening be more likely to keep him
alive than any equivalent amount of mana spent on the buffs?

As a cleric, I can tell you that it really doesn't matter that much
whether my tanks are buffed or not.  They would be scandalized to hear
this since buffs make them feel all warm and fuzzy, but it's true.
Heroism gives about 380 hit points for 140 mana.  CHeal can heal 3000
or more for 400 mana.  You tell me which is more efficient.
Personally, I'd rather save the mana, but tanks don't like that :)

Now sure, you could make a case for those very rare circumstances
where an extra 380 points make the difference between life and death,
but I'm really not at all convinced they happen that often.
