just out of curiousity, as I would never think of such a dastardly thing as
twinking, would wand are you refering to? Not that I have a lvl 17 wizard
that hasn't seen any play time in month. Oh and btw, I hear a runed circlet
and a black chrystaline robe are also items to look out for, never mind the
mask of secret, book of obolus and the teachers syllabus.
