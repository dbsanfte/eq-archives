I don't play a warrior but I believe there are some pretty good
reasons to put the mob's back to the casters (as well as some already
listed, to put the melee behind it as well).

For one, you can see the casters.  If there is an add *on the
casters*, you see it coming immediately and can taunt it, call the
add, move your mob, or whatever the situation calls for.  You can also
see an add coming and tell teh group to react before it becomes a
problem.  If you are facing the same direction as the casters, then
there's a good chance everyone will be facing the same way.

Two, and probably just as important, when you do lose agro, you don't
lose sight of the mob.  It runs ahead of you which means it is still
in view and you can immediately run toward it and taunt/continue
hitting it.  If it runs behind you, chances are you will take some
time just looking for it, especially on lower-end machines, before you
can taunt it and return to slashing.

Three, and already mentioned, there will likely be a few pets or other
melee beating on the back of the mob, which means the mob will slowly
drift away from the casters and toward the MA.

Four, if casters are too stupid to park their pets in the path of
incoming pulls, they will likely have their pets at their sides.  When
they send them in, they will send them to the mob's back.

...just a few ideas.
