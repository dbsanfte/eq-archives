You know, Jim, as I've been reading this thread, I've been impressed
with one thing in particular. Every person who has responded to you on
the particular point of the "threat" has disagreed with you. 

Now, it's possible that we're all wrong, certainly. At one time in
history most people believed the world was flat, after all. However,
while it is possible that we're all wrong, and that you are right, any
reasonable person would be giving very serious consideration to the
possibility that *you* are, in fact, the one who is wrong. I
personally consider that a possibility with a probability rapidly
approaching one.


Another thing which has me curious, is your rabidity on this
particular, and relatively unimportant, aspect of the subject. The
subject, in case you have forgotten, is the actions by an unknown
individual who contacted me pretending to be a GM. I'm somewhat
baffled as to why anyone would, out of the entire thread, latch on to
defining one little word over and over, and generally ignore the
larger and much more relevant issues.
