 My luck tends to go up and down in a fairly regular cycle. One week,
everything's fine; the next, things I try just aren't happening. Observe...

  The phases of the cycle tend to shift in the middle of the week, most
commonly Wednesday. So: On Wednesday, May 12, a week began in
which my fortunes were good, at least to the point of objectives being
achievable with effort. Adas got to finish her PoJ trial and her first few
AA's. She formed a BoT group. She got LDoN's with all-65 members to
back her up.

  Then, on May 19, the luck just stopped. KEI was hard to come by in
PoK. I tried taking part in a Lords of Corruption & Friends Fear raid
that Friday; we didn't even manage to break in, got wiped by the
Ireblind Imp. Needless to say, my friend Kam, organizing the raid, gave
SOE a few earfuls about the obvious content problem. Groups were
hard to come by; I started working more on my various alts, getting little
things done that could be done solo. Against my better judgement I took
some grouping and open raiding opportunities: a group in Storms that
broke up just before getting the bone I needed, a hedge event that wiped
on the last collection piece - chanters weren't quite fast enough mezzing
everything. I was actually glad for the patch downtime on Wednesday,
the 26th.

  Phase shift again: I log on that night and KR is in Nurga; the server
reset meant the slaves had to be freed again, and our leader decided to
get the jump on the other low-end guilds. The mobs there were easily
quaddable for Adas, if they weren't casters - magic damage would be
no problem, but casters tend to stop when casting, and will be out of
range of the AE nuke that blasts their still-marching friends. But with
a guild to back me up, we did collect five and six at a time and AE'd
them down. The waves were much tougher; each goblin was planar
strength. But our chanter had it in hand, and we freed the ogre slave.
More of these later, surely, then on to the real prizes in Droga...

  That weekend, several open raids. Grummus falls, another free - well,
not-ground-out AA. Plus, Adas even won the Fetid Flesh Bracer he
dropped - my first planar raid uber-loot won! Another try at the hedge,
dosen't seem so tightly controlled, but no one gets stuck in the walls,
and our chanters are a little better in the last encounter; we finish it,
and Adas is flagged for PoNb.

  It is also possible, in good-karma weeks, to exhaust much of that
karma in the first few days. On Sunday I joined a Xanamech raid for
a PoI factory key. It was horrlibly organized. A druid who chose the
wrong moment to go AFK unannounced was left to die at the hands
of the gnome we were escorting, who dosen't like wolves. When we
got to Xanamech, the fight itself went well enough, and some nice
loot dropped, but everyone FOLLOEWD the instruction of the raid
leaders not to hail the gnome yet. So we waited...and rezzed our dead
...and rolled on loot...and after a while the gnome began walking off.
Still, no one hailed him. He got to the door...but it didn't open for him.
He just walked into it. We opened it...and POOF. Gone. Warped back
to his little hut. No one got flagged.
  Well, this may have been a graphics bug, or it may be that there is
a time limit in which to start hailing the gnome, and our raid leader
screwed up by not giving the order in a timely manner. It makes it
all the more understandable, then, that the MB raid the following night
- which I didn't attend - got exactly one person flagged: the one who
hailed early. Everyone else got killed by a train of mobs following people
from the entrance who didn't want to wait for rezzes to get to the planar
projection. Sometimes you don't know whether to laugh or cry.

  Summer's coming up. Soon, the servers will be flooded with new characters
and with old ones who don't get played much during the school year.
More groupage, more chances for grindage for my lower level alts.
Lots of ooc's asking "How do I get to Shadowrest?" and "WTF? I got
stuck in a tree?" and "$%^%^ mobs are falling through walls!!!" Welcome
to Everpatch, boys and girls...
