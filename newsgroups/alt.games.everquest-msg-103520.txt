If the need for communities to form militias arises (civil unrest/war,
natural disasters, etc), it will be too late to "go buy some guns".
How would your town or neighborhood defend itself against a marauding
band of looters/thugs, if the police or national guard are not
available durring a crisis? Such a scenario is far fetched, but the
possibility exists. Durring the LA riots several shop owners armed
themselves and successfully defended thier businesses against rioters
and looters. 

The concept of a militia is to protect a community in the absense of
(or in opposition to) the government.

Fair enough

Why do you own the gun then? 

I would also like to see a "well regulated militia" formed of
concerned citizens who are properly screened, trained, educated, and
licensed/deputized to protect thier own communities. It is unfair to
place all of the burden upon local law enforcement. They are
overworked and under appreciated.

Just knowing that such individuals exist would deter many would be
criminals. Communities that allow licensed people to carry concealed
weapons have lower crime rates.
