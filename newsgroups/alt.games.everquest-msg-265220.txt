Basically, vengence.  A very powerful motivator.  About the only thing that
tempts me back to EQ1 is that I occasionlly remember that I never did go
kill that named Treant in North Karana.  I was running through there around
level 30 with my Wizard, and he rooted me, DOTed me, and started casting
some nuke that would have killed me, but his nuke had a longer casting time
than my gate, so I got away, and then had to spend a couple minutes sitting
there at my bind point (Lake of Ill Omen right near the FM zone) waiting for
the root to wear off, and hoping no one brought a train to the zone.  (In
retrospect, I probably should have ported out, just in case).

So, I owe him a visit.  I have a couple Ice Comets I want to give him.

Sounds like perhaps WoW is for you.  (I'm assuming you've already looked at
DAoC and didn't like it).  WoW, I believe, has a PvP endgame available, and
I'm convinced from DAoC that this is the way to go, rather than the "bigger
and bigger mobs" endgame which tends to spiral out of control.

(I've also been told that WoW has both PvP endgame and raiding endgame, so
maybe they will have the same problem EQ1 did after all.  Anyone have any
more information on this?  There are many EQ1 uberguild players working for
Blizzard on WoW, and so are well aware of the problems in this area, so I'm
assuming they have some plan to avoid it happening to them).
