Pulling point system
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
CLUB TRAIN INDEX
(compiled by Breathe/Flitterbick, proud member of the Club $# guild on
Bristlebane )

Trains in EverQuest are an inevitable occurance. Yet despite the
frequency of trains, little effort has been expended towards the
scientific goal of rating these oft-maligned forces of nature.

Until now . . .

NOTE - For your train to be valid for rating under the CFTI, it must be
an UNPLANNED train. While any idiot can maliciously cause a train if
they set their mind to it, TRUE training comes from the heart. It is
the wondrous alignment of lag, carelessness, and sheer dumb luck that
coalesces into a living, breathing example of Chaos Theory at it's
finest. Spontaneity is your goal, and this is defeated by premeditation
or intentional efforts to increase your CFTI once you realize your
innocent little pull has mutated into the most feared of all events...
a train.

This index would not have been possible without the dedicated, nay
FANATIC efforts of the many pullers within Club $# and the many
suggestions from others across all servers. I would thank you
individually, but I'm too busy looting my corpse.
