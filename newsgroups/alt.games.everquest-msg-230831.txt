My favorite sites were the first time I was in NRo and killing dervs and
sitting and watching the moon overhead, and then later my first trip into
Marus Seru I was awestruck by the site of Norrath filling the sky.  It was
pretty breathtaking, and even now I sometimes stop to watch it when I'm
farming rockhopper hides.
