An even better way to look at it is the number of kills required to get
back to where you were before death. (Figures below assume Soloing Even
con mobs in a zone with a ZEM of 100, very unlikely, but the ratios will
be the same for any circumstances)

A death at level 29 takes 2.70 kills to recover
A death at level 30 takes 2.71 kills to recover
A death at level 31 takes 5.53 kills to recover !
A death at level 32 takes 3.00 kills to recover

A death at level 44 takes 3.64 kills to recover
A death at level 45 takes 3.64 kills to recover
A death at level 46 takes 7.96 kills to recover !
A death at level 47 takes 3.94 kills to recover

Again remember that these numbers assume Soloing Even con mobs in a zone
with a ZEM of 100 (and no race/ class penalties / bonuses)

Note at 59 it is 18.33 (SOLO EVEN KILLS) at 60 it is 24.82 !! (level 60
mobs solo!)

HTH,

Jim
