Yes I know the server hasn't come down yet but on EQ forum SOE dev is
allowed to post the patch notice the night before the server downtime.
Lots of spell changes incomming...

*** Highlights ***

New Veteran AA!  We are proud to introduce our 9th Veteran AA - Armor
of Experience!

New Hot Zones!  A brand new set of zones have been selected to be
"Hot."  The previous zones have had their experience levels returned
to normal but the special events in those zones remain.

The following zones are now "Hot":

20 - Netherbian Lair
25 - Crypt of Dalnir
30 - Crystal Caverns
35 - Iceclad Ocean
40 - The Scarlet Desert
45 - The Burning Wood
50 - Dranik's Scar
55 - Acrylia Caverns
60 - Dragon Necropolis
65 - Wall of Slaughter

Be on the lookout for a new NPC in Plane of Knowledge that may need
your help finding his lost possessions in the new "Hot Zones."

independently.  The ice component can land if the fire component is
fully resisted, and vice versa.

- Non-gnomes will now need to use a gnomish recharging kit in order to
recharge gnomish devices.  Gnomes will be able to make collapsible and
deluxe gnomish recharging kits as well.

*** Miscellaneous ***

- /who command specifies dead players with *RIP*.  This will only show
on /who and not /who all.
- You can no longer create a campsite by dragging two corpses near
you.
- Banner names should now show up correctly in the Find window.
- Buyers should now see updated prices next to the Buy button if a
Seller makes a change while they are browsing the wares.
- A new graphics optimization has been added to EverQuest to improve
framerate performance so that gameplay is more enjoyable.  Auto Portal
Volume Optimization has been implemented in the vicinity of objects
which contain large numbers of inner objects.  In some cases we have
tested the optimization and have seen a 15 percent gain in frame rate.

You can toggle apv optimizations off and on with the slash command,
"/apvoptimizations."  When EverQuest is loaded it checks for an
"APVOptimizations" key value pair specified in the eqclient.ini and
turns portalizing off or on depending on this value.  If a value does
not exist in this file it gets set to on by default and written to the
eqclient.ini file.  Once changes are made to the state of the apv
optimizations, the eqclient.ini file will be updated accordingly.
- A certain time between two /say commands is not required anymore.
Good people don't spam.


*** Future Tradeskill Changes ***

We will be making a change to the cultural armor that will nullify the
usage of all existing drops in the cultural armor and symbol crafting
process.  For the slot 12 raid augments, only the drops for the seals
will be changing, the rest of the drops required for the various steps
of the slot 12 raid augments will be staying the same.  Those of you
who have stockpiles will want to make use of them as best and quickly
as possible, as once the changes go in, the currently existing
cultural recipes will no longer work.  This change will even out the
disparity of drop rates between different races and remove the extreme
rarity of some items.

For more detailed information please see the "Upcoming Cultural
Changes" sticky thread in the Artisans Way forum of the official
EverQuest forums.
