I've seen terrorantula a couple times and was even killed by Bilge
once as a lowbie going to unrest (how's that for being born under the
wrong sign) along with a couple return favors. But the rarest old
world mob in my books that as far as I know still actually exists must
be Garton in Mistmoore. It's quite likely on some servers he hasn't
been killed since Kunark was released.
