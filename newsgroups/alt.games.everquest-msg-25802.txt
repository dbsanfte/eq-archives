No, I don't know of such a web site <EG>.

Left number is ping, next number is percentage of loss from the server,
next is percentage of loss to the server, last number is loosely data
size.  Big number on the left means things may appear laggy to you but
you may be able to play ok.  Big number on the right means you are
sending/receiving a lot of data, most likley you are in an area with
lots of players/mobs, spells going off etc.  Data loss, the two center
numbers are your biggest concern, especially as that number gets higher
than 10-20%.  The color of the bar is a major clue as to how your
connection to the server is, too much red and it might be a good idea to
go out for beers <g>.
