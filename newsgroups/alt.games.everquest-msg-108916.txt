ok, # 1, it's pixels on a screen. they're code on some computer somewhere.
meaning they're not real. A bunch of 0s and 1s.

#2  IT'S A GAME.

Third, I could really care less if I'm killing an orc or a dwarf in my GAME.
I want to have fun and blow off some stress. Does that make me evil? Nope.
It means that I'm directing a bunch of pixels to perform a certain algorithm
to produce a result.  in laymans terms, I'M PLAYING A GAME.
