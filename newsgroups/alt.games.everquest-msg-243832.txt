I've personally seen Daluda's Mending drop off vxed mobs and a Kod'Taz
named. From accounts I've read and my own experience it seems that vxed
nameds are one of the best bets for farming the new spells. At one time that
was also true of the named Sludge Fly in the Gamesh Lair exedition and I
farmed it pretty intensely for a while getting almost every new spell
*except* the SHM spells.

And then, recently, I had a miraculous week (there's a message here
somewhere on it) where *everything* seemed to go my way. During that week, I
was helping get a friend flagged in vxed and the named cragbeast, Umbiki,
dropped Balance of the Nile. Later *that same expedition* a trash mob
dropped Dulad's Mending. As the only Shaman in a group of friends, I was
awarded both spells. One expedition. When I wasn't trying. Go figure.

Don't hold your breath. Remember, "Shaman have recently been significantly
enhanced"!
