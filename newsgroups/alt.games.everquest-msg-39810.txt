It's slightly different. You lose 10% of the experience required to complete
the previous level multiplied by your class modifier (which is 9 for a
warrior and 10 for a druid, unless they changed it). But then the druid will
need more experience to level but will get slightly mroe experience for a
given kill.

http://www.geocities.com/sstair/eqexp1.html has a chart of how much exp you
need to level for a given class/race combination, although I'm not sure if
it was updated when the experience gained per kill/lost on death was
modified for the class multipliers. You can work out the exp loss for death
pretty easily.

Yes. Which is why it's such a pain to die when you've just levelled - you
lose more exp than if you were still just in the previous level, especially
if the previous level was a hell level.
