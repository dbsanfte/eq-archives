Is this a problem that plagues you?  I don't get unexpected aggro through
walls anywhere except Saryn's tower, and I've pulled damn near every zone in
the game.  Maybe you have lag problems.  I know one guy that manages to get
aggro in some bizarre ways cause he lags and ghosts into mobs.

Pathing points are zone specific.  Pathing rules are dictated by the game
engine.  Pay attention, we've already covered this once.

Disciplines.

And you claim that you pulled?  I pulled that many wipes on Vindi alone
while my guild worked out how to kill him (looking back on those days while
single-grouping him makes me chuckle).

Maybe you mean just in a group...  in which case, with undeniably several
times your time played as a monk, I can match your claim.
