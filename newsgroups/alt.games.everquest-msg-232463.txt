You can *ONLY* get to Hate via a Wizard.  He uses up a stone (reagent)
every time he casts the Hate portal.  An entire group can be taken
using only one stone.

They are called 'Fuligan Soulstone of Innoruuk' and as you say are
sold in the Neriak Cleric guild.  The cost was reduced substantially
in the last few years to approximately 150pp.
