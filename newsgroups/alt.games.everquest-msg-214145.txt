It's called "exaggerating for effect".  Read the first sentence again; I
don't actually say that clerics absolutely cannot solo.  I just heavily
imply it.  =)  Then I immediately contradict that implication with the rest
of my post.

Whenever a cleric asks me about soloing, I start by emphasizing that clerics
are not a soloing class, that they get slow XP from soloing, and that they
are much better off trying to find a group.

Then I tell them where and how they can solo *if* they really want to.

The first sentence was deliberate exaggeration.  The rest of my post shows
that I do, in fact, believe that clerics can solo.

Don't be so literal.  My intent is fairly clear to anyone who actually reads
the entire post.  =)
