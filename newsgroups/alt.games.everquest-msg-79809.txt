I also have a few questions regarding the lightstone quest; is it true
you can also do this quest with one of the gypsies in Oasis?  If so,
what is the gypsy's name?  Can both good and evil races do the quest
in Oasis?  Do you get the same experience and the Concordance of
Research that you can sell back for 8 pp if you do the quest in Oasis?

I know for folks in the EC/WC area, evil races can do the quest in
SRO, but if good races would only have to go to Oasis to do the same
quest that would be quite a bit easier than having to go all the way
to NK, so that's what I was wondering.
