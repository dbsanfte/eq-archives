I believe it's a rogue quest in Kelethin...rogue or warrior, at any
rate.  Quest NPC gives you a four-slot pack to combine 4
pixie dusts into and trade it in for a bronze weapon or newbie
armor.  Exp and faction are more important, though, especially
if the guy doing the quest at the appropriate level can offer 20
pp for a stack. :-)

'Course, you don't have to be a certain level to do it...whenever
I'm around RunnyEye with any character, I always kill gobbos
just for the RV/Kelethin/Kaladim faction +'s.
