Well, for the most part you're right.  OTOH, it is the high level 
characters who buy this stuff.  Let's face it, nobody really -needs- 
batwings at 2 or 3pp a stack.  It's done because it's minorly convenient 
and because it's an overt way to hand money to newbies who don't beg.  
However, if the high level characters have turned channel Auction off, 
because they're on buysell...

Regarding newbies, I'm on Xegony because I have friends on Xegony.  
Anyways, if you're new, you have no idea whether a server is established, 
full, or what, since Verant took down the stats, so you're as likely to 
land there as on one of the recently split servers.

Anyhow, I'm hoping that people realize pretty quickly that small items 
should probably be on /auction, and start paying attention to that, if they 
aren't already.  I also think that'd be a reasonable place to offer/solicit 
taxi service and buff service...all things that need local presence.  It's 
-not- a reasonable place for SoW Plz, but then, what is?  :)
