It has a few meanings...

First as you are using it, but some folks call that logging too, sometimes
"camp-out" as in "out of the camp"

Secondly it is more commonly used to refer to PC's gathering in a spot to
kill monsters or wait for a particular monster to spawn. "camping" orc 1 in
the East Commons would mean you are wait at that spot to kill stuff that
spawns there. So "camping" and item or mob means to stay at that spot until
your goal is acheived.

There are lots of "camp" spots that are easy kills and offer good loot, so
they tend to be "camped" most of the time. Big monster spawns like Lodizal
in Ice Clad Ocean are sometimes "perma-camped" meaning there is always
someone there waiting for it to spawn, usually because the reward is very
very valuable.

So when someone shouts for a "camp check" they want to know where everyone
is at, so they can find a spot to hang out.
