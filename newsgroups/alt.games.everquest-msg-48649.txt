I have just hit 44 with my druid and gave up my quest to kill every ulthork
in the world.  I have moved to LOIO and am trying to quad kite the Bloodgill
Goblins.  I have read many post on the internet about it, but still am
having a problem.

I am a little confused as to where exactly they are.  I can swim out and
find one (i hear they are always in 2s, but i see one).  I am trying to hit
it with a low level DD to pull.  I try to grab another 2, but the first ones
are bashing on me so its hard to get the spell off.  So far, I have only
been able to get 2 at a time.  So, question is how do you grab 4 of them and
live to hit the land and kite them.

TIA
Dinke Lilipution
