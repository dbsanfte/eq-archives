The one good thing that DAoC had to offer me, was the way that the guild
that you were in was displayed below your character name.

Why don't they do this in EQ?
It is much more pleasing to the eye than one huge line of text. I know you
can turn it to only display one name or 2 or all but how about a setting to
display guild names under character names.
