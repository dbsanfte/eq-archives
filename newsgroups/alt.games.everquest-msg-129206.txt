Hi, I was just reading to know what this damn long thread was all about.

What bullshit!

You cannot judge both parties' actions in the same way. Israel has a strong
and well-equipped army. What can the Palestinians do? It would be impossible
for them to win a fair fight, so is their only option submission then? I
don't think so. Since the popularity of guerilla warfare, people have
understood that you don't have line up like in the 19th century and shoot at
each other to win. The Palestinians have no chance of winning a fair fight,
and their basic rights are being trampled. I can totally understand what
they do, because they don't have good options left. Put someone against a
wall, and you have to be prepared to see ugly shots coming.
