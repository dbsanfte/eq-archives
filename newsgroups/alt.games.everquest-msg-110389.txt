Poison and Disease spells add a number of "counters", and each
level of remove poison/disease spell removes X of those counters.

The low level cure disease removes one disease counter, the
spreading crud disease that fiends in Paludal proc has 3 counters,
thus - 3 casts to remove.

The heart of the recent change to slow spells was to make them
disease based, so they can be removed by cure disease and you
don't have to pillage enchantment through all your buffs.  The
lower level slows add 8 disease counters, higher ones 12 and 
16.  The pet heals (necro/BL/mage) were modified to remove 10
disease counters on each cast, so pet casters can remove slows
from their pets.  It takes to heals to get rid of the 12 and 16
counter slows.
