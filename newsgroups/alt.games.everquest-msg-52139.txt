As a shaman at level 38 now, I have found that I can do fairly well as group
healer, with judicious use of my slow spells.  I usually group with higher
level players, 40 to 45.  I've been playing in DL, and with some exceptions
can usually land my slow spell, which makes a nice difference in the amount
of damage taken by the group.  The one problem I run into is that some of
the group members also insist on getting buffed up, and that means sitting
around waiting on me to get my mana back after a round of buffing.  Lately I
have been experimenting with some potions, and for some reason, seem to be
running into resistance from the tanks I have grouped with, to using my
damage shield potion, at their levels, it's an 11 to 12 point damage shield
that lasts 10 to 11 minutes, and costs no mana.  I don't ask them to pay for
it, but so far, only my regular groupmates seem to want to use it.
