SK + Shaman.  Snare, slow, dots, pet, buffs, feign pulling, plate tank,
heals, root.  The only thing you lack is transportation.

Druid + enchanter is powerful, but limited in the zones that are viable to
grind in to those with suitable charm targets.  And charming, while great
experience, is incredibly risky.

Bard + shaman is a lot of duplication of abilities, and the worst possible
plate tank combined with the worst possible healing.  Besides being damn
near impossible to 2-box if that's the type of duo you're interested in.
