Wanted to start a thread for those of us Rangers trying to figure out
the epic 1.5 quest.  For those not paying attention, no one has
reportedly gotten beyond a particular point in the quest.  This is
being discussed on eqrangers.com and the Rangers Glade but it can't
hurt to spread the discussion around to make sure as many brains can
join the storm as possible.

The quest so far, in short:

-Forage some hair in Rathe Mtns and give to Athele in E Karana
-Turn in what she gives you to Corun in SFG
-Forage several things in OoW zones to create a couple weapons in your
fletching kit.
-Attack four animals with the fletched weapons.  If done right, they
despawn and give you a trapped animal.
-Also outright kill two more humanoid mobs and loot their blood.
-More combining to create a turn in item for Corun in SFG.  He returns
his notes.
-Everything to this point is complete...
-Find someone to hand the notes to????

No one can figure out who gets the notes.  Trying not to make this too
long but the lore goes like this:

There is some disease spreading amongst animals who eat the hair you
foraged in RM.  It is now spreading to humans or humanoids.  It
attacks the mind as well as the body.  Symptoms are dry, flaking skin
and corruption of the mind leading to madness or something similar. 
You are supposed to find an expert in diseases, particularly those
that affect the mind, to talk to about this new ailment.  So who is
it?  People are literally handing in the notes and saying all the key
phrases they can think of to each and every NPC in each zone they
enter, all around the world.  Sickbay in PoTranq, all around PoK,
Erudin, shaman guildmasters and related NPCs as well as clerics
(healers), enchanters (mind), Grieg's End (Grieg went crazy), OoW
zones, NPCs involved in existing quests related to sickness and
disease, Grimror Plaguebringer, Jaelil the Insane, and on and on...

I invite everyone interested to check out the message boards at
Eqrangers and the Glade to get full details for any clues the lore may
provide.  More importantly, there is a serverwide channel you should
join:

boyfriend, or how much you hate your job.  Epic 1.5 discussions
only...
