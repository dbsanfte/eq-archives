The current patch message on the Test server says:


 > - Four new crafting abilities have been discovered: apothecary,
 > weaving, timbercraft, and geomancy. These skills allow all
 > artisans to refine the materials and components needed to make
 > final products. New recipe books can be found on merchants or
 > scattered throughout Norrath which teach you how to use these
 > skills. Artisans automatically gain 5 points per level in these
 > skills.


In other words, they are giving up on the idea of interdependence 
within the game's tradeskill economy: that sages in order to make 
spell scrolls need components that are made by alchemists, and so 
forth. Every tradeskilling class will now be able to make all its 
own ingredients.

So the in-game economy goes from 3-dimensional to 2-dimensional, 
and hence becomes much less interesting. I suppose players must 
have complained that interdependence made successful tradeskilling 
too dependent on other players. What a shame! EQ2's tradeskill 
economy was developing in ways that promised real lasting 
playvalue, but...oh well.
