Everquest used to be the game every other game compared itself to. But
at such a small share I can see why people I talk to don't know what
EQ is but sure know what WoW. I guess Soe is doing something right by

Less subscribers = less groups
Less subscribers = less buffing
Less subscribers = no more Everquest

Flame away
