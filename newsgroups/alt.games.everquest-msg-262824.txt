While soloing in PC, where death meant a 30 second run to my corpse, a 
mostly full mana bar, and took one mob to regain the unrezzed xp?  No, 
why bother?  I certainly did not bother with getting rezzes, that would 
have slowed me down.  Heck, with luck, I could take one of the mobs down 
with me, and already have regained the xp I was losing.  :b
