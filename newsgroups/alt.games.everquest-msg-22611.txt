The spectre is the 59 (last) necro pet, Emissary of Thule. I doubt it would
con lower than 44 more likely high 40's which puts it a fair, few levels
above a spectre. Other than that it sounds like a characters pet, altho I
recall hearing something about a name spectre in Oasis but looking on the
web I can find nothing about one <shrug>
