}Can't say for the enchanter ones, for the equivalent shaman spells,

Well, Malos line is widely suspected to not be much aggro.  I suspect the 
reason for the effect you're seeing is that your high-hate slow is 
landing one malos casting time sooner, rather than the trivial additional 
hate of malos.  BICBW. :)

}I do know that slow will pull a mob off an enchanter that tashed, unless 
}that enchanter is already too low on health from being smacked a couple 
}times...

Here's the funny thing.  I've noticed that generally, if I tash, and then 
someone slows, the slow will pull it off me.  But similarly, if the shaman 
is quick off the mark and slows before my tash lands, the tash will pull 
it off him nearly as often.  The mob seems to weight the hate of whatever 
happened most recently a bit higher.  You could think of it as hate 
decaying over time.  You can see that effect a bit more long-term if you 
go tash a level 1 firebeetle, and then stare at it and do nothing for a 
while.  Eventually, the firebeetle gets bored and wanders off, exactly as 
if all the hate it had for you decayed.
