If you want true realism, allow for a 'will' to pass on certain
posessions.  

Personally, I wouldn't set it up so 'mortals' are running around in
the same world as immortals, though.  And I'd make true death at least
uncommon, if not rare;  leave pseudo-death (or as I'd call it, 'mortal
injury') at about the same rate, but each time there's a chance it'll
be permanent.  Adjusted according to the number of times you've been
mortally injured within a certain time frame, and maybe according to
the overall risk of what you're doing.
