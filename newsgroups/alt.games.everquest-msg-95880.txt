A 53+ rogue can solo there, too, provided that you have some
sort of good self-healing that makes you efficient.  Iksar regen
BP won't cut it, but bandages+fungi or Mrylo/Velious BP with
self-heals work fine.

Trick is damage output.  Monk and rogue can put out enough
damage to kill blues solo, but then they'll be hurt.  If you've got
a "fast" way to heal up and keep your efficiency up, you can
solo all day long.
