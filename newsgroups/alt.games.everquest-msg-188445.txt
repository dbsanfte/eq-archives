Now it is an argument in semantics. In other words, a pointless and
stupid argument.

I understood him to be asking if they had implemented the same type of
quests for Ogre shaman, that say a Dark Elf Cleric has. You understood
him to be asking if there were any. I assumed, I was wrong for that.

Let's not get our panties in a bunch, it is just the usenet. The flame
potential of the usenet is astounding.

John Cleese as Archibald 'Archie' Leech: Alright, alright I apologize.
I'm really, really sorry. I apologize unreservedly. I offer a complete
and utter retraction. The imputation was totally without basic in fact
and was in no way fair comment and was motivated purely by malice and
I deeply regret any distress that my comments may have caused you or
your family and I hereby undertake not to repeat any such slander at
any time in the future.
