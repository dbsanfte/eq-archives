Wow this whole "bitching" at Verant's customer service is really pissing me
off.
It's a game and it's there game. You people expect so much for $9.95 a
month.
Hell, most internet providers cost more than that. That's about the price of
going to a movie as well.

What do you expect them to do? Wash your clothes? Do your homework?
Walk the dog?

Stop blamming your own stupidity on them. If you cant keep your password
safe and secure than perhaps you need to spend that $9.95 on more cat food.
