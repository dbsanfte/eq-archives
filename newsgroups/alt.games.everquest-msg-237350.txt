The guards you are probably going to see most often will range in
level from around 10 or 12 to as high as 50 or 55.  The problem is
that they tend to be undercons.  In other words they are pretty tough
for their level.

As a Dark Elf, I assume you are probably going to be hunting the
guards around Freeport.  (I also assume you do not want to kill Dark
Elf guards...probably a bad idea).  Out there in East Commonlands you
can find several guards that you can *probably* kill around level 12,
maybe lower or maybe higher.  But I suggest you get yourself a SoW
cast on you before you try so that if your snare is resisted you can
run to the zoneline or get far enough away to try and snare again.

Also remember that some guards are not meant to be killed.  There is a
guard in North Ro (near East Freeport) that can barely be soloed by
*some* level 65 people, even though he may be only level 20 or 30. 
(He regenerates probably 1000 hitpoints per tic).  Gate guards are
difficult to kill as well (*very* high resists).  They are there to
keep newbies alive after all.
