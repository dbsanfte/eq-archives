Please don't toppost here.

I don't know how to make them off hand in EQ2, as I was sufficiently 
annoyed with them from EQ1 that I never bothered to check if they can be 
done in EQ2.

For something like Mez, I can see the usefulness of this, for tossing out 
heals and buffs and even slows, it just gets damned annoying.  Everyone 
should be assumed to be capable of doing their job in the group until 
proven otherwise, more spam to inform us that you are doing your job is 
just annoying.  Mezzes are different, in that it is useful to know which 
mob(s) are being mezzed.
