I just turned into a lvl 39 ranger and Im lovin it. But ive noticed that
soloin makes it alot easier to lvl. Even though Verant encourages groups Ive
noticed that Soloin cougars at my lvls 35 on to 40 which ive almso aquired.
The experience fro these cougars do not seem to drop even though ive lvld
makin this other than my nOOb days the quickest ive ever lvled 5 lvls in 2
days est 12 hours though total of huntin. SO I ASK MY RANGERS OF EQ WHY
GROUP. why lvl by groupin when you can fear kite.
