Well, in that EQW won't necessarily run.  IE, above.

I know, I know, don't remind me >< I was fairly vocal about that point 
when they put in windows ability on Test.  They had a nice, simple 
program all designed, all they had to do was somehow fix that "let's 
turn the world white" bug that happens with 2 windows.

It was worse, much much MUCH worse, when they first started testing it.  
But dammit, I do NOT think, what, two weeks?, is a long enough 'test'.  
How about fixing the problem with two windows before unleashing it on 
everybody, including those who run two, three, or more accounts.  They 
claim they're fixing it, but if it isn't done fast (and well), I'm 
yanking my other account.  It's no good to me if I can't run them both 
at once.  (And no, to the anti-dual-boxing-ers, I don't DB)

What, and admit they suck?  Perish the thought...
