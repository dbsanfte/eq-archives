  I'd say yes and no.  Mind you, it's hard for me to know what an
appropriate price for the breastplate is because on my server (Firiona Vie),
the economy is a little different from that of more mature/normal servers.

  As others have pointed out, as a paladin, Ry'Gorr isn't your best option
for armor in this price range.  You give up a good bit of AC for not a whole
lot else.  On my server, Netherbian Chitins sell for under 200pp (I've seen
a few go for as low as 75) and that's a AC 20, STR+2 item.  However, I've
also seen people try to sell those Ry'Gorr breastplates for 1000 pp (prices
on my server tend to be a bit inflated, mind you.)  So while the price you
paid for the armor may not be totally out of whack, I'd start looking for
something in a similar price range to replace it that's more suitable for
you as a plate-wearing paladin, and then try to sell the battlemail.

  Good luck.
