I have had my first character for a while now, and back in the old days l
thought that maybe by selecting the same skill ie. forage or tracking in
more than one box it might increase the rate l learnt it(call me crazy!).
Now l would like to build up the skills l did not pick up from the start
(bind wound) except l cannot select it from the combat options and therefore
add it as a hot button.
Strage thing is, when l tried my account on a laptop, l got to reconfigure
all my hotbuttons and skills, so l am wondering if there is a way to change
the settings on my desktop.
I have had a peep into the ini files, but am a little wary to touch anything
that might create a problem down the track.
Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated!
