Having to FD every 5 seconds because your warrior is incompetent at holding
aggro is:
a) not fun
b) gives a massive hit to the group dps

There are things the monk could have done to minimise his/her agro.. maybe
they did do these things, who knows.  It is hard to not agro without losing
DPS though, if the warrior isnt as well equipped as you.

If im doing a small 1-3 group thing with my guild and the warrior isnt one
of the better geared (still a level 60 warlord) they usually ask me to tank
all the stuff on the way, and then they will /defensive tank the boss

Normally the stuff dies so fast that it doesn't matter who tanks it (other
than that they are getting heals) but you dont have time to wait for the
warrior to establish agro, and when your at 100% haste, duel wielding a
18/20 and 15/20 with a 150dd proc, it takes a lot to keep the agro off
