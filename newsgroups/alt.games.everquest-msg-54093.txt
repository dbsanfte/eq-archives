And a paladin in bronze is going to stick out anyhow. 

 OTOH,  If I see someone wearing black chain trousers, or sleeves, I
might want to inspect to see if it's something new(BA for example)  or
something I can't wear(Ravenscale)  Then I might ask where they got it.

Someone sees my druid in her very cool green plate shirt, claw and
Shield who sees her casting SoW, might want to inspect to figure out
what other gear she is wearing.

Only time anymore inspects bother me are when they are followed up w/
d00d cn i hav that phat earing.

or

Bah N00b ur gear sux.
