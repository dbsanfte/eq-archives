I've just made an alt, and got my main to pass on a pile of coal, tim,
fur, etc.

Took me less than an hour to get to Artisan 6 (bearing in mind you
effectively start crafting at lvl 3).  I'll get her to 9, then do the
minimum to leave the island, then become a citizen.  After that,
she'll be a pure tradeskiller.

I did this to remove some of the dependence on others for crafting at
higher levels - at 15, my Rogue Scholar can make a pile of spells and
powers (App IIIs), yet can't make one ingredient - iron spikes.  A
guildmate will make a me a pile soon, so I can make some App 3s for
myself and the guild, but until then I'm stuck.

Hopefuly, having a pure crafter to complement main main should
alleviate some of this.  Levelling should be fast, too, as she won't
be adventuring, and will have a steady supply of materials from my
main.
