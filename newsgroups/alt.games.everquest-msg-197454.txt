For some fraction of the population that is true.  For others it is not
true.  For still others it is sometimes true and sometimes not.  Your
assertion that it is an absolute truth is complete bullshit.  Not all
minds work alike.  As a trivial and obvious demonstration of that you
need but consider those minds and talents commonly spoken of as genius.
Look around you at the world and you will see many exceptions to any
"rule" of the sort you claim above.
