I use a macro to twist 3 songs and it works great!

Yes...occassionally I will miss a note and have to wait for the cycle to
complete but I don't have to concentrate on the twist while I'm fighting.  I
also have /stopsong hotkeyed.  BTW, this is when fighting solo.

I know the bard *purists* frown upon using twist macros but it works great
for me.

It took a while to experiment with timing the pauses.  I would post the
macro here but I'm not at home.
