   Wow.  And talk well about it you did.  Thank you very much.  I saved this message,
and will be refering to in in the future.
   I guess I should have said in my starting post that I am committed to this
character.  I know that shaman bring alot to the table, but considering the needs of
my guild, and the fact that I am partnered with an ogre warrior with massive hp's
(right now I'm still using my level 5 heal... I feel like a ranger when I see what my
best heal does to his health bar.  I know that's temporary, but still, I think that I
made the right choice for me by going with cleric.  And I didn't forget about the rez
thing clerics get.  Lenny and I have eaten many, many deaths over our careers, it
will be nice to be able to by step that.
   Also, earlier in the thread, some of you have askied if my guild is looking for
you particular class.  We are.  The Council of Mithril Dreams is a role-playing
guild, but isn't fanatical about it.  All races/classes are welcome.  You can read
more about the guild and roster at www.guildmagic.com and from there you can access
our website.   Or you can come visit us at the Carnival we are having in Freeport
next Saturday (Lenny's going to be in the Dunking Tank!)
