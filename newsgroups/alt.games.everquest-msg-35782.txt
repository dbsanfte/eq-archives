Unless they made some very recent changes, what you were there for was
the actual tagging when the guild comes into existance. Before that,
however, the prospective guild leader and a minimum of ten members will
have to meet in a chat room with a GM and get ten votes for the creation
of the guild and approval of the name.
  Then, an appointment will be made to meet a GM in game at a later
date/time and have him tag the guildmaster, etc. and bob's your uncle.
