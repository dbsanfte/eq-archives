Heh. The memories. I created a Human Mage, Finnegan, in Mithaniel Marr, 
the very first day the game was released (I've since deleted him, and now 
I regret it bitterly :(  ). I used to hang around Felwithe, fishing off 
the bridge, and presenting those cute female High Elves with summoned 
Wisps, roleplaying it to the hilt.

Hell, I remember that my summoned Snake Fangs at lvl 8 were an *upgrade* 
for most people I gave them to, and would last forever if kept in the 
bank.
