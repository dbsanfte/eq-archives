Okay, to add a little humor into this mean-spirited spew that is going on in
this thread today…

What exactly would be the repercussions of not paying back a loan?  

Would you lose faction with the local guards for each day that you are late a
loan payment?  Would a ogre follow you around and keep telling you that you're
late on your loan payments?  Would you become KOS in the particular bank that
you did not pay the loan back to?  Would each time you used the /auction
command a /ooc would appear above your name that says "I AM DEFAULT ON MY
LOANS?  Anytime you make a trade with a PC would the item or plat be
confiscated to repay your ill-gotten booty?  Would you log on one day and be
completely newbie naked with a message telling you that all of your items have
been repossessed? 

Just a few thoughts….
