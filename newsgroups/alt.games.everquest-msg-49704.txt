A) get them yourself... try Kurns or Paineel newbie zone, both
excellent sources for large quantities.

B) go to either of the above spots and buy em... again, you'll find
newbies with lots and not a lot of competition to buy em.

C) list a character name... awful hard to go into every zone
with a /ooc looking for the character played by David Wood

D) I don't play on Xenogy, so don't bother sending me a tell
with your character name... just being helpful or a busybody,
depending on your point of view
