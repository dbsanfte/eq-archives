I think generally someone who advertises them selves as a Twink is saying,
yes I'm only 22nd, but I could handle myself in a group of higher levels
because I have better equipment.

I've twinked my monk with a few HP/AC items and a few good weapons. I've
found that in groups of my same level, I have better AC and HP than a
warrior 2-3 levels above me (yes i'm still very low level). This means that
in addition to the normal bonuses of having a monk in your group, I can take
the hits and deal out more damage than you would expect a monk of my level
to do.

I don't advertise myself as a twink... but it is true that I could handle
myself in a group where a monk of my level might otherwise be considered a
liability. If you are sitting there with 5 people in your group (lets say at
level 25 since that seems to be the example) you might not want a 20th level
monk in your group. Perhaps if you knew I had 250 more HP and 75 more AC
than an untwinked 20th monk, with fast high damage weapons also, you might
reconsider.

Once again, I don't do this, but I think this is why people say that.
