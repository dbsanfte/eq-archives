Can anyone help me out and tell me what type of armour a druid can wear. Is 
it medium, light armour or very light?

Also whats the best armour to kit a lvl 10 druid out in? I have three 
crafters around lvl 18 so I can make any of the items in the recipe books.

I've spent so long building my three guys up in crafting that I have 
forgotten most of the basic adventuring stuff.
