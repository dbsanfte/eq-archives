    Not my decision to make, as the 54 rogue. The ranger was determined to
get the SK to tank, though, and given how crunchy she looked it did make
sense. When she tanked her HPs dropped faster. (Her visible gear looked like
garbage for the level - not even a PSC for a BP, let alone Velious armour or
Tolan's. Given her guildtag, it wasn't surprising.)

    Oh, totally - if she'd had the gear to back it up. Have you noticed
strong variability in tanking ability over the same /con? As in, does a
level 46 with X AC and defensive skills seem to tank the same as a level 60
with X AC and defensive skills against a level 45 (blue to both) mob? It
would be tough to test because of the Dodge, Parry etc. being raised on the
60, but I wonder exactly how much of a difference it makes. (I have noticed
the difference soloing my WAR - I'm looking for numbers here, like the "10%
damage per 100 AC above 1300".)
