Okay I have a problem, up until today (6/8/02) I was able to play EQ with no
problems.  After d/l'ing the most recent patches (haven't played in a couple
weeks) I am unable to get past the server selection screen.  I can click on
the play button, but the screen just goes black and does nothing.

The system I am trying to play on is

Packard Bell
300 mhz
256 mb of Ram
10 gig HD
Video- Rage Pro Turbo AGP 2x
sound- On Motherboard
all expansions installed

I have tried uninstalling the game and reinstalling, then downloading all
the patches again.  That didn't change anything.

I know that the system doesn't really meet the specs that VI has listed for
the game, but it has worked fine until now.

Any suggestions would be very helpful
