Well, the downtime can vary quite a bit dependant on class and
tactics. At low levels, tactics will make the biggest difference in
how much downtime you get. Once you get to about level 10 to 20, you
will either have to start grouping, or pick a class that solos well.
(Unless you, as the other poster pointed out, need to bone up on your
reading.)

If you want to solo a lot in the future, there are a number of classes
that solo well.

Solo Well from under 10th level:
Necromancer (Pet)
Mage (Pet)
Bard (Kiting)
Beastlord (Pet/Slows/Buffs)

Solo Well from the mid levels:
Shaman (Pet/Slows/Buffs)
Wizard (Quad Kiting)
Druid (Quad Kiting?)

Solo Well from relatively high levels:
Ranger (Kiting)

I'm sure I'm missing something (probably lots of somethings) but I'm
sure others will fill in the weak spots, or refute my claims.

Of these I'd say those with minimal downtime, using the proper
tactics, are Necromancer, Bard, Shaman, and Ranger. (Though as a
Shaman, the downtime is longer than the others, but it is filled with
Cani-Dancing to keep you occupied.)

If you don't intend to be a soloer, and just want to solo until get to
10 to 20th level so you can start getting groups more reliably, then I
can give you some advice.

Whatever class you pick, head to Everfrost. (Zone outside Halas) Kill
all the skeletons, (watch out for the vengefulls) polar bear cubs, and
wooly spiderlings. Pay special attention to killing all the skeletons.
Keep all the Spiderling Silks, HQ/MQ/LQ Bear Skins, and Bone Chips you
find. In fact buy any and all you can afford from the vendors if you
see them there. You can sell the Bear Skins and Spiderling Silks for
good money, and then take the bone chips to Kaladim and give them 4 at
a time (unstacked) to Gunlok Jure, a Paladin Guild master. Not only
will you get really nice faction (making buying Pally spells for your
other character easier) but you will get a good bit of experience too.
IIRC, a full backpack of Bone Chips will get you to level 10 at least
or a level or two if you are still under 15.

You can get to level 20 this way faster than fighting level
appropriate mobs solo, with classes (such as wizards and warriors)
that don't solo well.

Just my opinion though.
