ignorant to what?

you guys get into a jealous frenzy because it was a FoH person who
discovered it, when as James has already shown, a person can be anything BUT
uber to hit that cap.

if anybody is ignorant here, i think its you.  Lets look at each item
individually...

Mosquito Eye earring  - pickup group in CT

Tiny Gear-Shaped earring - (unsure on this one) the CT maze quest?  If so, a
2 group encounter

Mushroom Veil - Solo, easy

Black Sapphire Velium neck - trivial

Jungle Spider Fur cap - CT group, ive seen 3 people do this camp (or rather,
1 person and 3 bots)

Shadel Bandit ring - 2 person exp duo in FG, easy

Di'Zok Signet of Service (the ring you get just for being Warmly to
arnaks)  - 1/2 person  "quest"

Zombie Flesh Wristband -  pickup group (ct i think)

Supple Scale Armband - solo

Gloves of Viscid Slime (his uber-loot) -  2-3 group thing (btw u think the
ft4 gloves are > his 100hp bracer, James?)

Thurg quest arms - could buy these for peanuts, if you couldnt do kael
yourself (can solo bank and have these drop)

Squallsurge Shawl (8th Coldain if he has time for tradeskills) - Shawl can
be done with 1 person for most of it, the rest with a few friends

Hiero Cloak - pickup Seb group. easy camp

Thurg quest robe - same as quest arms

Grotesque Girdle - A demi drop in PoF.  At a rough guess, there are THIRTY
guilds capable of killing Demi's on Prexus, im sure its even higher as this
is one of the easier demis

Dreadfang's Hide - CT pickup group, maze. 3 people can do it.

Boots of Flowing Slime - Pickup CT group

his epic - dont need to be in an uber guild to do this either.  not sure
what id class as the toughest part.. VS isnt an uber-guild-only mob (i've
seen 3 people kill VS). Phinny is less than a groups worth.  Enraged golem..
2-3 groups, easy

Orb of the Infinite Void - if your on kael faction, can do this with less
than a group.  if your not, well buy one, it isnt expensive

Frozen Orb - 2 people. also aout 100pp to buy

>>He's at 1265 MANA from items. 123 MANA more and he's >>done. If his guild
figures out Cazic Thule and he wins the Brain >>that's 60 MANA down, 63 to
go.

Finally were at a "tough" mob.  For a larger guild, hes an easy 25 person
kill.  A smaller guild, maybe more.   On prexus there are over 10 guilds who
can kill Cazic

The number might even be 15, but I'll stick with 10.  Think of every caster
in those 10 guilds.  Prexus has 4 large guilds, the rest would not be
classed as "uber" - thats at least 6 guilds full of NON-UBER people that
would be within 63 points of their mana cap.

So, ignorant of what?
