Sounds kinda like there is a problem with the GeForce drivers. Go to the website for the card and
make sure you have the laterst drivers, the ones that come with the card seldom are. You might also
might want to run out to the Win2k site and do an update to it as well. Then try to install each
thing one at a time and try to run EQ. That should let you know what is causing the lock up, then
you can contact Verant or the manufacturer of the driver and see about a patch to fix the problem.
Hope this helps.......
