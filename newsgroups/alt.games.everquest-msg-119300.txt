I'm looking for information on this spell and its "history" in the game.
It's a level 39 wizard spell, and it's *not* the same is the IVU that
clerics et. al. get.  We can't scribe theirs.  As far as I know, it's
mob drop only (if it's even in the game.) Some older posts on Graffes
and at Castersrealm seem to indicate that it dropped in GD of some
wurms.  However, with our mains we have farmed spells in GD for far
longer than I'd care to recount, and I have never seen that spell drop
once.

We don't have many wizards in our guild, but among the ones we do, none
of them have it, and I'm the lowest level, actively playing wizard in
the guild. (39 as of Wed. Yay, me!)

It looks like there was some sort of issue over the clerics and paladins
raising a stink over wizards getting this when it first came out. So, is
it still dropping in the game? Any of you have it, or *personally* know
somebody who has it? (Not your uncle bob's pharmacist on a different
server.)  If so, where did it come from, and is it worth my time trying
to farm it up for my wizzie?

I have all the 39 spells now except that one and the quest only hate
reducer. (Concussion?) and I might not even bother trying to get that
one.
