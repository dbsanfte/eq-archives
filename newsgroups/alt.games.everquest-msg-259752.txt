Still unable to dig up any help, I decided what the heck, give ring 7 a 
try solo too.

Over to the prison area, found the single kromiff prison guard (NE 
corner of the area) and killed him.  Killed a bunch of ulthork which 
aggroed, killed some other kromiff guards, killed some ogre mercenaries 
  I don't recall seeing before, and their captain.

Killed a second spawn cycle.

Next pop was Warden Burke.

I targetted him, went around to the back of the building he was in, and 
tried snare, which stuck.

Ran off with him to shore, where I wouldn't get any ulthork adds to 
annoy me, and melee'd him down with little difficulty.  Contrary to 
rumor, he did not insta-gate away at end of fight.

Looted shackle key, plus a giant femur two hander which procs Yaulp II, 
I could pretend to be a paladin!

OK, cleared the area around Corbin, handed him key and my ring, so he 
took off.  Followed him around, again nothing aggroed, and then suddenly 
giants and orcs popped around him as he started dialog.  Waited for the 
second phrase, then hit him with an axe from range; oddly the giants and 
orcs didn't aggro on him (I swear they were right on top of him), and he 
didn't aggro on them as he doesn't do so until after second phrase, but 
I hit him right after he said it.

So he ran off after me, and I took him back away from the mob that was 
supposed to kill him, around to the shore, and all the way to the 
Iceclad bridge, where I snared him and then zoned out and back in to 
clear aggro.

A minute later, my snare wore off (guide talks about 14 minute wait if 
you snare him... which is of course because whoever did it used their 
long duration snare!  Might I suggest the level one version?  Of course 
Berserk don't have to worry, our best snare is still 1 minute duration)

Then we took a long walk back to Dobbin camp, he stood about a bit, 
despawned, and Dobbin asked me for my ring.  Handed that over, got note, 
off I go to Garadain camp.

Bad news (not that it wasnt' mentioned beforehand); the giants and orcs 
have cleaned the camp out.  I see Commander there alone waiting for 
repops; he's camping the spawn!  Pull him over out of range to kill 
him.. but he's tough.  I get him to 75% but I'm down to 40%.  Snare him, 
and kite him around running backwards with SOW on, flinging axes, for a 
long time.  Finally, I'm at 100% and he's at 40%, and I let him catch up 
at last.  He takes me down to 40% again before he finally dies; 
unstunnable mobs are really tough on berzerkers; I wish there was a 
similar series of quests for giant friends instead, coldain would be 
much easier to handle!

Now the Krommif Guards are engaged with the coldain, who have repopped; 
I pull them off one at a time and dispatch them easily; they are LB to 
me.  The Rygorr Brawlers show up after this and engage Garadain, I come 
in and kill one, but now he's running, so I aggro all three of the 
others and kill them all; one is LB the others all green.  Kill them, 
wait a bit, kill a Rygorr Scout which has aggroed on Garadain on his way 
home (he's only at 11%), then finally he gets back to his spot and I can 
hand in my ring and note and get ring 7

Still lame

AC 7, Str 7, SvM 7, wouldn't wear it on a bet.

BUT ring 8 is worthwhile and in reach, finally, all I have to do is 
scare up a guildmate or something to help me with it... if possible. 
Thus far, guild has not really been exactly supportive.

Grage, 55 Berzerk, Luclin
