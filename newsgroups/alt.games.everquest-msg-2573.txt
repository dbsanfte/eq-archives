Exactly, those aspects were added after the fact.  A game based around
pvp from the start might have included factions or limits on recall
and property outside of lawless lands, the ability to hire npc guards,
the ability to id player accounts instead of characters, etc. Anyone
who makes a game where one character can hurt another hasn't made a
pvp game. A pvp game includes soft and hard means of separating pvp
from pk and grief.  UO had none.
