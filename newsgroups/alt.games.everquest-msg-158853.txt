Actually it is possible.  Check the stuff they find in the Amazon rainforest
for example (admittedly a quite different environment from SW England).
Various species of frogs, spiders, insects, mosses, et cetera, are confined
to single trees.  You can examine a frog (for instance) and nail down the
precise tree it comes from.  So, take out five trees, you might render
extinct 30 or more separate species.

Doesn't mean that the original poster isn't an idiot, however.
