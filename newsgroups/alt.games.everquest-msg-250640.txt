To be fair, I should mention that the family guild I was in at the time
didn't make me become a druid.  I just kept my eyes and ears open (so to
speak) and realized there was a need for more porters in the guild.  Plus,
I just like to be useful/helpful.  :)

I'll happily admit I enjoyed the versatility of my druid.  The pok was
definitely a powerful emotional blow to me, but in the end, I still got
my "I'm useful" fix by being primary healer in some groups (I couldn't
always pull this off, but it was better than nothing when no clerics
were around), back-up healer in lots of groups, nuker (when healing duties
were fully covered elsewhere), and all-around buffer.  By the mid-40's, it
was fairly apparent my druid wasn't particularly good at any one thing,
but I liked how the class could contribute something reasonably valuable
to most groups (even if the contributions weren't huge).
