Nothing wrong with having 10,000 guns, actually, it is using them in
certain, but not all, ways that is wrong.  Examples:  using them to shoot
innocent children is wrong.  Using them to defend your rights against a
dictatorship is right.  That is why the constitution gives us that right.
Or reinforces it.  I believe it is the born right of anyone on any planet to
acquire whatever means necessary to defend themselves, their families, and
their rights.  "It's freedom, baby, yeah!!"
