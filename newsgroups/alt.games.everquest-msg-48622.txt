on test server, Aradune was out in the karanas fightin with his old buddies,
and near the end, someone took him down, I forgot his name... it was
announced across all servers a few times. I also recall hearing that the
GM's took form of gnoll and/or orc gods, really huge gnoll or orc and went
around fighting.
Me, personally, I was playing an 8 necro, there was a party going on,
everyone going PVP and fighting or dueling, and people were adventuring from
Antonica to see as much as they could. I inspired about 10 people to join me
in attacking a guard... We all died but it was fun. Never made it back to
the docks, the servers went down as I got into view of my corpse =(
