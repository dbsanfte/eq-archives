People are banned daily (across all servers, not on every server). But
banned for ebay? I wouldn't know. They used to give us a list of
people who were banned and why, but they haven't in a long time now.

These days, judging from what I pick up on the side, most people are
banned for lying to GMs for something serious or multiple severe abuse
cases.
