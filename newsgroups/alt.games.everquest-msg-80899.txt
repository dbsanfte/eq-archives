OK, for some reason this scares me.  I know he's a gnome, and and 
enchanter, and now I just picture him in his little yellow robe going wild 
on bats and bugs.

I haven't played an enchanter, or really any caster, but wouldn't you at 
least want one of each type of spell to work on your skill increases?  I'm 
also pretty anal about having all spells, but as a bard with generally 1 
spell per level, it's a lot easier and cheaper.  (OK, full disclosure, I 
don't have EVERY bard song, I'm missing the level 20 mini-manasong.)
I was actually planning on stopping by and paying you guys a visit last 
night, but the silly wizard TL'd me to GD rather than GF.  I know I should 
have read the confirmation box better, but I was busy sending a snotty 
reply back to his 'hit ctrl-d before accepting please' TL message.  
Sometimes being a smartass bites you in the ass.
