Well, all those classes above might have a use for the spells/abilities
themselves. Granted they're better for other classes, but they can use it
none-the-less. The Viscous Mana is used for Wu's Armor which is basically
useless for enchanters. If the spell was modified so that casters could wear
it the Wu's Armor wouldn't be so damn hard to make because most enchanters
would have the spell around at lvl 12-20 to make it themselves.

The point is that ie Tailoring is pretty much stuck at the Viscous Mana vail
part. I myself have 5 Glowing Wurm Biles waiting in the bank for at least 1
month now. I have my skill up to 95 due to crystalline silks and I might get
a bit more out of them, but eventually I need to switch to Wu's Armor.

I'm waiting for an enchanter to have the Thicken Mana spell and I carry 4
stacks of pearls and 8 stacks of Poison Vails with me just in case (I can
get pearls easier then the poison vails). I have 16 silk swatches waiting in
the bank for the occasion...

I agree, but practically every skill any class has is also shared with
another class who only uses it as a secondary part. Look at shaman healing,
bard's mana song, SK's FD and the paladins and sk's for tanking for your
previous examples.

The only "one-class only" skills are the mana vails and enchant metals of
enchanters and, sort of, the tradeable summoned items of mages.

Hmm.

I think it would be a good idea if mages could get "summon mana vail"  spell
and enchanters "enchant weapon" or somesuch. Make the other class's spell
higher in level and maybe add a chance to "corrupt" the made item so the
first class would have a distinct advantage (like a warriors ac/hp vs a
pally's or sk's or the cleric's healing vs shaman's)
That would eliminate the class restriction on these 2 too specific skills.
