Nope, I'm not going to sue you, 'cos you happen to have hit on the answer,
bless you.

Now how the hell did that happen?  I dunno.  But thanks for all the
suggestions, peeps, very decent of you, and it just goes to show what you
can find out by asking.

Incidentally, and utterly unrelated to EQ, does anyone know what the
'Archive' attribute is for?  Yes, I know you all do and I should too, but I
don't...

Oh, and incidentally again, sorry for the delay in replying, but I've been
AFK for a few days.
