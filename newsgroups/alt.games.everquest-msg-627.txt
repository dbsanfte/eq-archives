  My Dark Elf Shadow Knight is looking for new armor and I was wondering what I
should get him. Right now he has full Rygor, except for the following things
which are replacing Rygor peices, hero bracer, crested helm, and dwarven work
boots.  Our any Dark Forge peices better than Rygor?

Thanks in advance,
