Cleric wasn't bothering. We just sucked up the damage and kept the heals
going. Chanter kept all the caster mobs alive the longest to keep
pillaging, including the froggy shaman, while we focused on killing the
melee types first. We had enough damage output with that group that they
were going down before the DS took us *too* far down for the cleric not
to be able to keep up. It was an exciting group, though, and very fast
action. I'd reccomend that spot (Seb Jail) to anybody looking for a
good, fast paced xp grinding session.

Of course, that said, last night we failed to get an even adequate group
together and got wiped out between the entrance and guards. Wall of six
frogs came out of noplace. Ouch.
