month or so, I'd log in just to see if there were many changes and becuz I 
was bored with what ever else I was doing. Sony will make millions on the 
initial sell but the game is not that good. DAOC is better IMHO and 
hopefully something better will come out soon but it's not EQ2 or WOW. Save 
your money unless you just like blowing $50.
