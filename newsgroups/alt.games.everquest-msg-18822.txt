Evacs cast faster and refresh faster.  Meaning you stand a better
chance of getting your party out alive, and if your'e getting hit on,
you have less chance of getting interrupted.

Although, it's arguable as to if all those different evacs are
actually *needed*. Personally, I only evac to Greater fay.  It's the
lowest circle evac I can cast that does not have guards patrolling the
area.
