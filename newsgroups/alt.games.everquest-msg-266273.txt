I'm am very confident that the chances of them losing a court case
against these guys is absolutely nil. The reason they don't act is
because it will cost them a lot of money even if they do win, and
letting the IGE scum keep going isn't costing them any real amount of
money. When the expense of fighting them in court becomes less than
the cost of letting them go, they'll do something. Which will never
happen. It's pretty common business practice. Case in point: Even the
RIAA was silent legal-wise on MP3s until file sharing became big and
they started seeing record sales drop.
