Ok, how about the knowledge that everything is made up of four elements?  A
natural scientist in the Helenic era could have told you that.  If you
didn't believe him, it may be because you had too much black bile in you,
and your humors weren't in balance.  It took "sifting through the entrails
of dead animals" (today refered to as "disection") to figure out that we
were wrong on that count.  Or, how about the scientific belief in
"spontanious generation."  You know, how flies are spontaniously born from
dung piles?  That one was only dispelled late in the nineteenth century, and
actually still hunt around into the twentieth.

Odd how "whacky" ideas take root, at times.
