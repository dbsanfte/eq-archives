I find myself in the comfortable position of having obtained all the 
items in my shopping list. I'm currently at 216 WIS, and I think that, 
save for a horse or a CC shield (to replace the rather plain-looking 
CGS), all my equipment will serve me well into my fifties.

On the other hand, I find myself seriously hankering after a cool toy, 
and the Elder Holgresh Beads (unlimited charges of Eye of Zomm, useable 
from the inventory) are just what I need, but so far they have been 
hideously expensive, due to their usefulness as a pulling tool. Since the 
Eye of Zomm has been made non-aggro, I was hoping that the prices will 
have fallen dramatically. Does anybody know if this is so, and the item 
has become affordable (i.e, less than 10k) again?
