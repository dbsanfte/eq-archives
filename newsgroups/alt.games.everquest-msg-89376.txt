Ahem.  Yes, Killing green things is easy, usually.

I have no problems with the furbies, its just that gornit himself doesn't
like to die all that fast.
And actually I prefer to sit at the little peninsula just down shore from
the pirate camp, and look across the water to Gornit's spawn point, then
just take a step forward to stand in the water and engage Gornit with snare.
