I'll grant that many raids are "interesting" for some of the 
participants some of the time. My comments are aimed at the generic 
mass. In almost any given raid, there is someone being challenged, but 
for every one of those there are 2 more someones who just need to  not 
screw up.

I'm not saying that raiders are crappy players. That was never my 
intention, merely that raiders aren't by definition better than anyone 
else. As a collection, yeah, I'd have to admit virtually all raiders in 
high end guilds are competent players, and there are definately a number 
of exceptional players among them. But all that's required is 
competence, and you can find exceptional players outside raid guilds 
too.

Maybe in LDoN or zone-in camps.

I wiped my 40th level alt in dulak.. that took an hour, I wiped my 40th 
level alt in dalnir bottom, that took an hour too. I wiped him in CoM 
temple... that took an hour too, and in kaesora... =)

CRs solo/duo/trio are often pretty hair raising time consuming events. 
When you have that few players you start missing key utility... you 
don't have summon corpse, or rez, or perhaps invis, or ivu, or rogues to 
send in...or whatever.
