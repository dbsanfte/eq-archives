Good. Any player should be able to be an artisan without rolling an 
'artisan character'. EQ was stupid for rewarding int casters so heavily 
as tradeskillers. (Before mudflation made it easy for anyone to cap 
their stats that is)

Anything beats: combine, autoinventory, combine, autoinventory, combine,

Welcome to the 21st century. Its just a redefinition of the old words... 
you know doublespeak like: "beta" means pre alpha but we want you to 
invest so were telling you we're pretty far along, "kludge" means 
innovative feature, "live" means paid beta test, "3rd expansion" means 
gone gold. "Patch" means "nerf", "Customer service" is asking how your 
customers can serve you, "bug" is a problem that players create by 
straying off the 2 test scritps... :)

I liked the "EC tunnel". (Although on my server at the time it was 
actually NFP)
