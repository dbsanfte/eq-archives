Didn't say that.  To expand slightly on what I <did> say...
Not all players are fascinated by the raiding culture.  Those who are
not, and are not guilded with others who are, may never even see an
epic cleric thru 35 or 40 levels.  Certainly, if they're not going out
of their way to learn in advance about aspects of the game that will
not apply to them until the distant future, they can easily not know
what the effects of any/all epics.  Remember, until very recently the
Cleric epic was very uncommon at all outside raiding guilds, and even
now it's not exactly what I'd call common.  We don't all raid, we don't
all level quickly (my main was over 2-1/2 years old when he dinged 50,
even now, 9 months later, he's still 3 blue short of 55, and I've known
some damned decent players who gained levels slower than that), we
don't all care all that much about the high-end game (I like reading
about it, but I can't ever see myself in a raiding guild, others don't
much care about it, still others wouldn't likely play EQ without it).

It's ubiquitous in the parts of Norrathian society that <you> frequent.
The experience of other players can, and does, vary.
