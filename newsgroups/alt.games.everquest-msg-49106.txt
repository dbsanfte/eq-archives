My experiences smithing as first a high elf cleric and then a dwarf cleric
lead me to believe that INT and INT alone affects skill ups, while
WIS and STR together affect successes.

My High elf had high WIS and INT both, and lousy STR.  My Dwarf
has high WIS and STR, and lousy INT.  High elf rarely failed and
learned quite rapidly, dwarf also rarely fails, but learns -painfully-
slowly.  Get an INT buff and some INT gear and his learning rate
goes up... but even buffed up to some extent he's nowhere near
the 150 INT my high elf ran around with (try half that), and also
has nowhere near the learn rate.

My Dwarf WIS was lower than my High Elf's, but fail rate
was similar, I attribute this to significantly higher STR (as in twice
as much)

This is all anecdotal, of course, I've not run ten characters in
each configuration in order to see what the real effects are, and
there's a fair amount of randomness involved, as anyone who's
seen twenty attempts go by with nothing and then gotten three
skill ups in a row could testify...

If working to improve skills, and you have int and wis gear to chose
from, money no object, put the int gear on.

Your question, though, was what to wear for successes... in which
case I'd go with WIS and STR.
