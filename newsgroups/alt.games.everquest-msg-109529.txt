Personally I read his post and thought to myself "Right hand on the
mouse..."??  That's just stupid. <EG>  Those of us who started with
computers before the mouse was invented tend to play much more
efficiently by using the mouse sparingly if at all in most games.  His
perspective seems to be just the opposite, he uses the mouse to control
movement and assumed that was how everyone does it so it would be stupid
to think his right hand would be on the keyboard.

That being said I still find strafe running a pain in the butt <G>.
