You keep saying that like repetition somehow makes it more true. The entire 
story of EQ2 is merely a continuation of that of EQL. A large portion of 
the lore of EQ2 is *shared* with EQL. How must more related could they be 
without actually providing a way to set back and forth between them?

It's the same franchise. It's the same world merely hundreds of years 
apart.
