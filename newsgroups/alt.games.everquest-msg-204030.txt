You just had to point that out to me.  Here I was in blissful ignorance 
thinking that the shaman one was different somehow in a good way.  Aside 
from the 3x mana cost, the shaman version is also 3x casting time.  Well, 
at least I was only one of a very few that was stupid enough to camp the 
mobs for the drops for this spell.  The thing that irks me the most about 
it is that originally, shaman got the same spell, but then they decided 
that it needed to be changed for the shaman.  Fuck you Verant I'm 
quitting and I'm deleting all my stuff.  Well, ok, not really, still a 
great spell that I have gotten a fair amount of use out of in both CT and 
PoS.  Most of the other healer types I play with don't have either 
version of it, and rely on Radiant Cure which has a long refresh time in 
comparison.
