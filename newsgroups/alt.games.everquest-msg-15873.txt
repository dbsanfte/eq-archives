I was in a group in DL a couple nights ago that at one point consisted of my
then 41 druid, a 44 cleric and a 49 ranger. The ranger was a tank, I was a
lifetapping wizard (I miss that bone club! Dark ember's burn proc just
doesn't have the same coolness) and the cleric decided he had to be a necro
to keep with none of us fully playing our classes. The ranger did a pretty
good job of tanking and I started an OOC debate on ranger tanks just for the
heck of it :)
The only times grouping with rangers has been a PITA have been occasions
where the rangers haven't been able to manage their aggro compared to other
tanks and group members (mana sink) or occasions where I've been primary heal
in a group full of hybrids and the rangers won't pay attention to my requests
that they snare/damage shield/sow so I can save mana to patch them up with.
It's also annoying to be unable to cast a dot because a ranger already used
the lower level version of it :)
