Very common question.  This is how it works:

If you don't have 2500 mana, then you can't cast MGB HoV.

If you have between 2500 and 5000 mana, you can cast MGB HoV and it will use
all of your available mana.

If you have more than 5000 mana, you can cast MGB HoV and still have some
mana left over.

The long and short of it is, if you have enough to cast HoV, you have enough
to have MGB HoV.  Just plan to be OOM for a bit after you cast it.
