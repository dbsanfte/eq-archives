> I bet you had some wizards in your group too? =P

I joined another guilds Vindi raid last night (a weekend of NToV has trashed
my CoV faction) everybody was in full groups except mine (me 60monk, my
cleric, and a 60 guildie bard)

The scary thing is me and the bard were getting the exp on mobs.. what
chance in hell did they have killing vindi with that damage output
