Kelethin still cracks me up. It's not unusual to be on the ground at any
point around Kelethin and occasionally catch the image of someone
falling to their death. It reminds of an old skit, I think it was Monty
Python, where two guys are in an office and one has his back to the
window (John Cleese, I believe) and the other guy (I think Eric Idle)
keeps seeing people falling past the window. I think I've become
obsessed with falling damage. Last night I was at the tunnel entrance in
East Commons and kept climbing to the top of it and jumping off to hear
myself crunch on the ground. Then when running through the desert of
North Ro, every time I went over the top of a dune I would jump to see
if I could fall. One time I fell about 3 times right in a row going down
a steep cliff. I think I'm going mad.

It's something from which it's so hard to be free.
But none of the tears that we cry in sorrow or rage
Can make any difference, or turn back the page.
