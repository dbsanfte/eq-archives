AHAHHAHHA that is funny. I think that is the all 60 guild some friend
of mine joined when going to stormhammer. 

You know, if ONE thing might make them have sleeper reset sometimes it
might be the Legends server. "I pay $39 bucks a month and can't even
wake the sleeper?? WTF!# &#*($&#(*&*(!&!( !! !!"

Basically that guild was right when they said someone would wake him
eventually, why not us? Someone would.

In a thread from your thread:

http://www.dreamwater.org/observer56/

That is interesting. You see this Kaladur guy reason that the best
reason to wake the sleeper would be so other guilds spend MORE time in
sleeper during evenings because they get vellium slower, freeing up
more spawns (elsewhere I guess? ) That sounds like pretty sound logic
to me.

The bottom line with this whole stupid ongoing sleeper arguement is
this:

Other players in a game should never have the power, via the games
design, to actually affect the value of play for other players.  Since
you can  do that , evidently via this sleepers thing in EQ, then the
design of the game is at fault instead of any player. People should
never complain to a player or guild about this but rather to verant
directly. If it is a flaw then its a flaw in game design.
