I'm surprised that SOE didn't actually nerf the items more.  Personally
I would have like to see a minimum level requirement on some of the
items (like the Ishva Robe) so that level 21 characters wouldn't  come
down and clog up the works.

It seems to me though, if you want to kill a game you don't kill it by
making it harder or nerfing lots of stuff, you kill it by giving everyone
and their brother some pretty fantastic loot that is easily obtained.
Maybe SOE is looking to push people to other MMORPGS.....
