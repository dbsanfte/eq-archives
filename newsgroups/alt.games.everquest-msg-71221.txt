I soloed my Enchanter to 20 with no probs.  I used the pet just like a mage
would except I buffed the crap out of it.  I also learned how to take a few
hits to get the mob off my pet.  After 20 I gave the pet up and grouped.  Of
course this was all before Breeze.  Now I think that any enchanter can get a
group after lvl 16.
