He's not going to get anything - because of the way most companies cover
their VAT issues people forget they dont pay it, the company does (in this
case because they are multinational - World War II online does do this
because they are entirely US based and so Im buying a service in the US
and using it exclusively there - [probme grey area in the laws wording]
and they are entirely US so not registered for VAT in the EU).

OTOH they might get a tad irritated when th various EU governments do
their checking a year's time for compliance (they are going to do this) if
SOE gets picked as one and they find the discrepancy - think it might be
an entirely different set of laws they go for him on and a whacking great
charge into his credit card - which they can do

I waiting to see whether they define elctronic service entering the EU is
going to be defined better....SOE are stuck with servers you get access to
inside the EU and outside so squarely cross the boundary but others arent
registered so dont get indication...yet anyway...we'll see if others get
charged...
