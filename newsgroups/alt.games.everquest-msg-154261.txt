I hadn't thought of that!  Great idea!

Another possibility would be to use /auction to haggle on prices and
set high prices if people wanted to buy without haggling.  Or just consider
them to be up for "best offer".  A price set to something like 999,999pp
could be used as a flag to say, "I'm not AFK.  Send me a tell and we'll 
negotiate" :)
