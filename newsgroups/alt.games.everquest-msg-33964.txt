Well, we all know the dot/snare/root yourself stories, so wont mention those,
but i have a few:

Was getting the chanter Mana line of spells for a chanter, so headed to the LFay
brownie camp. Cast wolf form on myself at the zone to GFay and run to brownie
camp.....LOADING PLEASE WAIT!.
Had not notices i had sow on, so the wolf form didnt stick.

Helping a guy from guild get his corse in FV (stupid troll took the boak there),
and, as always, using wolf form.
Run towards FV Docks, and a Drixie charges me. Never been attacked by those
before, and its deep red to me, so head to the guards at the bridge and place
myself next to him so he can beat up that stupid butterfly.
Well, at least i learned that the guards in FV dont like wolves.

Was hunting in Befallen (old version, dont dare play with the DEs now), or
rather, camping Gynok for the XXXXth time.
Spend my time between the spawns by getting the 3 keys, so i can hand them out
to everyone who needs.
Head down to level 2 to get the second key, and forgot all about the damn hidden
hole.
Of course fall down the hole, and am charged by some necro, nuke her to death no
problem, all down there is green to me.
Only problem is that im OOM, so sit down to med. Get charged by a Willowisp.
Dont have any mana to nuke it with, but its green, so meelee with it a little.
It get down to 25% health and run away.
Getting tired of being down there, so head over to the door, and remember i only
have the first key.
Ok, what do a smart person do then? They do of course port to WC, so i sit down
to mezz the WC port. Get charged by a green necro. Meelee her halfway down. Get
charged by the willowisp who regained enought health to come back for more. Kill
the necro, and beat a little on the willowisp, and decide it need to die, so
follow it.
It run through the locked door, so cant follow it.
Experiment a litle with sitting down and realise that its impossible to med up
at level 3 if you dont clean a room first, but still oom and too little health
to meelee a room.
Get charged by willowisp again. Meelee it down, and it run to the safety of the
locked door.
Start shouting for someone to let me out.
Get charged by willowisp, meelee it down, it run away.
Spend a few min shouting, and someone wanna help me, but need all 3 keys first,
so spend the next half hour waiting for him to get them while meeleeing the
willowisp every few min.
Finally get out, kill willowisp since it have nowhere to run, head up, and camp
Gynok again.
