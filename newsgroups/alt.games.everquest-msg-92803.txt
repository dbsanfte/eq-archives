I died from this bug the very first time I used my brand new Ring of Commons
spell. I now always cast levitate on myself before porting to a busy place.
The guide who rezzed me thought that levitating would prevent damage if it
happened again.

By the way, it's not only port spells that have this problem. Today I zoned
from the Nexus to Shadow Haven and got damaged twice before I could move
aside. Someone was in the spot where I was supposed to appear. I had enough
hit points to survive this time.
