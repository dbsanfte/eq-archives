I took my 36 froglok cleric alt to DSP so he could continue his
journey to become a high priest/archon. But after one week in DSP I
have mostly been in bad/obnoxious groups and slow soloing sessions
while waiting for groups. This is my first char in DSP, my older chars
never where in DSP for levelling purposes.

Been thinking that I might as well choose the solo route before I take
him to DL. So now I need some good advices on where to solo him,
undead camps? or other places?
