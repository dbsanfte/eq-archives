OK, time for me to chime in with my perspective about KEI.   I have a
druid in mid 50s and cleric in mid 40s, they both use KEI.  Yep I have
a reason for the use of caster crack and am surprised no one else has
brought it up. (I may not have seen all the KEI posts but have read a
lot of them in the last 3 months)  I do want to go on record that I
have never left a group to "refresh my KEI" because I do not use it to
handle my assignments in a group.  Basic mana conservation takes care
of that.
My druid was my first and the one that I first noticed the EX trend
with.  I found the same trend with the cleric.  When in a group doing
healing and buffs I get EX. At times when I played with  my husband
and his toon we would compare the amount of EX  I was getting with the
amount he was getting. (We both in same group and at same lvl). He got
up to 1/3 more EX than I did.  The only difference was he was nuking
the mobs and I was not (mostly heal and buffs).  When I got another
druid to take my place as healer/buffer and started nuking and
thumping my EX bar started to really move.
I have seen this over and over with both my toons and so I get KEI to
give me extra mana regen while I nuke and thump. When KEI gone I no
longer nuke and thump, the mana conservation kicks in and also my EX
bar slows to a dribble.  I have seen this over and over again and
there is at this point no way to convince me that the EX is divided
equally to those in the group.
The side effect of my approach is that 1hb and 1hs are always maxed. 
Also I have spent a lot on armor for both so if I get hit it takes
more than one to kill me.  Also most mobs I have never seen the front
side but I can give ya details on what their butts look like.
So for me KEI helps me get more EX, and when gone thats it, unless I
am with a chanter who in in the group put it on me again.  I do
strongly recommend to any mana eater that they know how to play
without it, it makes you a better player in the long run.

That's it from this Lady Of Old
