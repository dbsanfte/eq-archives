We all gotta get our jollies somewhere.  "KEIing for 100p" when I need money
means I get no money.  "KEIing for 50p" means that I only get 50p from
people who would usually pay more."  "KEIing for donations" (whether or not
you want to be a prick about the "real" meaning of the word) is the only way
to get an AVERAGE of 50p...but more money over time.  But an average of 50p
sucks when the spell is worth 100p to anyone who wants to be FM for 2.5
hours.

So I abuse the greedy assed cretins who pay a whopping 10p.  Those cretins
are the people that can make due getting Clarity or even Breeze...or nothing
at all.  If you want an uber spell cast on you, you gotta pay an uber price
or suffer abuse.  And make no mistake...KEI is an uber spell or else I
wouldn't be inundated any time I zoned into Nexus without first putting my
epic away and going /role.
