Well, I rarely try for a 6 man group, but if I can get the right classes 
together I will take one. 

That means:
 Me (Monk)
 Tank (Warrior or Pally, SKs IME can't hold aggro)
 Secondary melee damager (Monk rogue or ranger(if I can't find a monk or 
rogue))
 Cleric(or Druid or Shaman(with Shaman being preferred over Dr00d))
 Enchanter or Bard
 Number 6, who can be damn near anyone... Preferably a shaman if we have a 
cleric or druid, otherwise almost any class. 

I also find that, with a good puller, a group of melees plus a shaman can 
be a fearsome thing. With 4 melees hasted, 1 shaman healing and buffing a 
little(mostly on MA) and me chain pulling, we can be constantly killing 
things and the exp and loot flow.
