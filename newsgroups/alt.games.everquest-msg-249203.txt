I play on The Nameless server, but I think this will still apply.
In.Swamp is never a busy place.  (I know as I am trying to get my Noobie
armor finished so I can do the "other tasks" for the rings)
As others have said, make your way to PoK and then go to Freeport.  This is
always busy on my server.  Others will be about your level and when your new
group is ready, you can cross the boarder to EC for the next level of
hunting.  All Frogs are welcome to FP and you can trade there.  Also there
is a bank in the other part of FP so you should be able to cover all your
needs as you learn the game.

Plaigue Rat Tails will get you about  1 1/2 p each so the loot is very good
at this level and you can trade the Rat Whiskers to the man just inside the
gates for xp and 1g 1s 1c.

P.S. When you take the portal to FP you appear in a cave.  Just go to your
left, past a lady, thru a large opening and THRU the wall.   Remember where
it is at as it is a hidden door when you are in the noobie area.
