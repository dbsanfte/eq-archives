You may be able to get close to a full set of Lambent armor for 1k... My 
bard is wearing most of lambent (no helm... I like the bare-headed look), 
and a combo of Icetooth Claws and Sarnak Eitchatka, for the double-clawed 
look. That would fit a Vah-Shir even better, and they are dirt-cheap 
these days.
