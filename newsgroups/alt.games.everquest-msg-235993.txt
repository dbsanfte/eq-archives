My understanding is that the LDoN booklet is wrong regarding the 10 level
difference.  I can't tell you from personal experience, but a friend told me
that he tried at 57 to group with other characters who were 65 on an LDoN
and it didn't work.  I didn't ask him exactly what happened - whether the
adventure recruiter would not give a mission or it wouldn't let him in the
dungeon.
