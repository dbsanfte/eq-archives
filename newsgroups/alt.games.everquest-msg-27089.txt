 Wow, what an idiot you are.  Try answering my question and MAYBE, just
MAYBE
 you'll get an answer to your stupid-assed question.<<

I took Dan's post as sarcasm, but being a very sarcastic person by nature,
maybe that's just me.

But he is right. Without knowing what you want, we can't really help you.
It's like if you told us "I'm tired of walking, I need a recommendation on a
car."

OK,
what kind of car?
do you like family sedans or sports cars?
you want good gas mileage, or does that not matter?
when you say "car", do you mean car or truck? or SUV? or van?

In case you didn't know before, giving minimal information is the same as
turning on the /sarcasm tag.
