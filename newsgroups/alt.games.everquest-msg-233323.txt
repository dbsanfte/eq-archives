Have helped a friend do this on my Iksar SK. It is very difficult to
get close to him without a skele hitting you and therefore removing
invis. Getting in is easy, invis and zone in through Field of Bone.
Run to the water and head to the tunnels. Pretty much you are safe
there from any Iksar aggro, except from Droz. However there are many
green con mobs there if invis wears off.  The best way is to have a
monk or tank simply pull him into another room and fight him there. Of
course Iksars are safe here so might be best to have one there to pull
him. The hit on faction is nothing major for Iksars either.

There are invisable doors/walls there that are one way, if you go
through and can't get back through you need to swim back down and head
back over. As an after thought, having a Mage that can CoTH would be a
nice added feature. Plant him in a safe area and get group(s) there.

I have seen him take dont a 60+ caster in seconds once a skele attacks
them and invis drops. He does flee when low on health which is why it
is best to either rush him in that room or pull him elsewhere.

Good luck.
