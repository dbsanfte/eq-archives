For a summoned, not charmed, pet, you have to do at least one point of 
damage in order to get all, or is it 99%, of the xp.  For a charmed/dire 
charmed pet, it works much like you describe.  I don't know if the 1/3rd 
number is correct or not, but it is supposed to be a hefty percentage, I 
thought one half.
