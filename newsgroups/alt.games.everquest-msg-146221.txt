Sadly, most SK mobs are immune to stun, I'm sure once I move
out of the zone I'll find a way to work stun in there, its easily the
best buy for the mana buck out there.

MOK, on the other hand... well when you have a 14/18 weapon,
22% haste item, and the haste off Yaulp V (it does have haste, I think?)
that little 6 hp per does seem to add up.   It only needs to go on
the mob once, simple enough to pull with MoR, root when it gets
into position, MoK, cast pet, dive in before pet figures out what
to do.  On the other hand, there may be more utility in Stun for
stunnable mobs.  I'm thinking in that case that I'd use MoR normally,
and swap in MoK if I have a slower working with me.

Ethereal Remedy is quite channelable, but its only a 1K heal
heal for the same mana as CHeal.  I found myself casting it
twice in a row, sometimes a couple times per fight.  Thats
1600 mana spent where I could have rooted, backed out,
Chealed, made new pet, and gone back in for... 35+400+180
= 615, versus the 800 of two ERs and got more HP out
of it in the bargain, perhaps enough that I wouldn't need the
second CHeal till after the fight is over (and no need for pet
then)

With an enshrouded veil (cause I've always used the pet
where I could get away with it) the mana cost on the
pet is lower than any heal I cast, so low that throwing one
away in order to heal myself more efficiently seems to
make a great deal of sense.

Perhaps with healing oriented focus items and/or AA,
the equation will tip in favor of the ER plan... which
if you look again, you'll see was already in place for
relatively easy fights.

Tried channeling CE, by the way, without the benefit
of stun it was a bit too dicey, except when I had a
chanter join me.  Slowed mobs, hasted me and both
pets... Man thats living, I could channel pretty much
anything I wanted, or back out and CHeal myself
with good odds the chanter pet would get aggro instead
of my little guy.
