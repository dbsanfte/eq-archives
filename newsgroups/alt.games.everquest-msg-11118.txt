The servers went down at 8am GMT and will be down for an estimated 13hrs
(expect more, it's a big'un) so you won't be getting on at all for sometime.
This is obviously your first patch day, allow me to direct you to;

http://everquest.station.sony.com/netstat/downtime.jsp

and

http://everquest.station.sony.com/

I am more surprised that so many others seem to be trying to log on while
the servers are DOWN.
I keep thinking I'm missing something here <shrug> Feel free to correct me
if I am wrong and the servers are meant to be up :ï¿½)
