You need DEX for weapon skill increases. Your DEX buff will help
with that. Use the lowest delay weapon you can get your hands on.
And when you reach level 24, cast Quickness on yourself.

This tactic works much better for druids, since their DoTs don't
do initial damage and thus don't break root. Yours do. And druid
root seems to stick a lot longer, on average, in my experience. 

Don't be afraid to go toe to toe after hitting the mob with
Walking Sleep and a DoT or two. Buff up your HP, AC, and AGI 
first. You need to do this at least some each level in order
to keep the important Defense skill going up. 

Shaman melee damage is not exactly potent, so you may find 
yourself having to root (or flash of light), back up, and
fire a nuke or two and/or heal yourself. Once you get a pet 
to help you dish out the damage, this becomes a lot more fun.
