So let me run away sheesh. (1)
Let me cast my FD.
Just dont put me in auto-friggin suicide mode.
Yet again I died this morning pulling a giant. Thats 5 deaths to LD and 1 to
the monsters this week. Yes, I actaully died a valid death this week... it
is almost enjoyable actually being killed fairly and squarely for once.
*cheer*
Ahh well, time for another CR. Guess ill suck it up until a better
alternative exists.

ps... to all those people who justify this on the basis of LD-cheating, try
dying 5 times in a week from LD and see how you feel about it. Its easy to
be generous when other people are paying the price.
