Names and guild, please? (email if you prefer - my addy IS real other
than the spamblock. Heck, who are you for that matter? : ) )

On a side note, we were in KK last night and it went very smoothly, in
addition to Phinny dropping both robe and the bard thing. Another bard
had been trying to get a Phinny raid together, we have only one
non-epic bard, and someone has a spine for chaining, so we told the
other bard to come loot. Unfortunately he didn't get down there in
time so our bard had to loot before it rotted, but we're going to
chain the spare spine to that other bard.

KK is a pretty zone - and pretty damned confusing, too.
