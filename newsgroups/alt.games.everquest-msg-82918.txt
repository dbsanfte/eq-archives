Thanx. And yes it is possible through dropping stuff on the ground

> How long will items last on the ground ?

30 minutes if i remember correctly. A lvl1 to lvl5 corpse will also last
only 30 minutes. Remember, in the time you change character everyone can
pickup whatever you put down, so it is better to make a friend, and  give
him/her the items so they can be given back to the other character.

You can make 8 characters per SERVER. There are over 30 servers available,
so you can play virtually any race/class combination if you like.

Dutch right? ;-)) Cheapy Cheesehead hehehehe......

You can pretty much attack everyone on a PvP server, although there are
unwritten rules to prevent you from slaughtering all the newbies that come
on I think..... I never played PvP before, so I don't really know.

Verant employee's.

Many items stack indeed, up to 20 in one stack. Rings do not stack by the
way, but many looted items (like gems) can be stacked.
