Well, as Sean observed, the trouble is that different mobs and
different zones are different difficulties.

This would mean that instead of gravitating to the highest ZEM
zones, everyone would move to the easiest killed mob zones, and
the situation would be much like it is now; everyone crowded into
a (different) 10% of the world.

My suggestion was designed to eliminate that; find an "easy" mob
in an unused zone and you have the best of both worlds, but when
other people discover it and start crowding in, it becomes less
and less lucrative, to the point where its better to go after
harder mobs somewhere else.
