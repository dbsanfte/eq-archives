If you've ever wondered why some people have called you a VAK, just go back
and reread your recent posts.  Nowhere did I whine.  Nowhere did I call Sony
evil.  All I said was that I don't like the direction they've taken the game
with recent expansion, LoY was farther in that direction, and the new
research is enough in that direction to put it over the top for me.

Your response is that I'm a moron, a whiner, and that I'm saying Sony is
evil!?  You seem to have a mighty big chip on your shoulder.
