Hi All

Here is the patch of the patch.

As promised in EQlive the missing tradeskill changes originally missed 
from the patch message for the 16th have been appended to the message 
for the 17th.

March 17th, 2005

*** Missions ***
----------------------------------

- Added the ability to see invisible to some of the NPCs in The Nest 
instances.
- Set some of the boss NPCs in Dragons of Norrath missions to summon. 
Being kited was making them sad.
- Removed a bug in the Rivals mission in The Nest that allowed groups to 
complete the mission more than once without speaking to the quest-giver 
again.

*** Tradeskills ***
----------------------------------
- Added some missing Troll cultural items to vendors in Neriak.
- Added a book to outline the creation of the new cultural sewing kits.
- All of the new cultural sewing kits can now be traded in to Caerlyna 
in the Bazaar for tokens.
- Meeka Diggs in Rivervale no longer sells Iron Thread and should now 
sell the three sizes of Mercurium Thread.
- Changed the text on Culturally Inspired Armor - part 3 to accurately 
reflect the pelts used for Half Elven cultural tailored armors.
- There was a new "Chunk of Ice" created for the Dragons of Norrath 
expansion. This new "Chunk of Ice" has been removed and replaced with 
the old "Chunk of Ice" on the forage tables for all Dragons of Norrath 
zones. They should also now drop off some of the colder dervishes. All 
of the new Dragons of Norrath drink recipes that used "Chunk of Ice" 
(Curdled Cream, Iced Coffee, Iced Tea and Iced Mountain Tea) now use the 
old "Chunk of Ice".
- Fixed a bug with the recipe for creating Barbarian cultural leather 
swatches. The recipes were mistakenly using the "Norrathian Needle" 
instead of the "Northman Needle".
- Fixed a bug in the recipe for creating the Dragons of Norrath cultural 
armor patterns that could allow a player to recover their ruined book 
with a successful salvage. Sorry, that was unintentional.
- Removed the Erudite Sewing Kit from vendors. The new kit is created by 
players and should replace the old kit.
- Fixed the Feir'Dal Fletching Kit. Really, we did.
- Fixed the Surefall Fletching Kit. (This was actually fixed with the 
last update).
- Fixed the Reinforced Jeweler's Kit. (This was actually fixed with the 
last update).
- Changed the Dragons of Norrath cultural recipes that used "Quill" to 
now use "A Quill" (used in research recipes). "A Quill" is also now sold 
on the appropriate vendors. (This was actually changed with the last 
update).

*** Ranger Epic ***
----------------------------------
- Modified the encounter with Grinbik in Bloodfields for the Ranger epic 
slightly. Previously he could respond with the phrase "I wish to speak 
with the one that freed me." when he was not actually free (for example, 
if the Marshal was still alive). Now he will not give that response 
until he has actually been freed. Hopefully this will remove some 
confusion from the event.
- A Ranger at the proper stage of the quest will now only trigger the 
Herrian Warfrost encounter if he or she goes down the corridor near 
where he hangs out and is at the proper stage of the quest with the 
necessary item on them. (This change actually went in with our last 
update).

*** Fabled Item Changes ***
----------------------------------
- The Fabled Mrylokar's Bracer has been made lore.
- Several Fabled NPC's have had their difficulty modified.
- The Fabled Glowing Kunzar Amulet will now be equippable in the neck 
slot.
- The Fabled Incarnadine Breastplate has had Iksar added to the 
race-usability list.
- Several Fabled Items have been returned to their previously tradable 
status on the Firiona Vie server.
- The following items have had their stats modified:

Fabled Jaundiced Bone Greaves
Fabled Insignia Protector
Bracelet of the Corrupter
Wristband of Spectral Corruption
Bracer of Corrupted Souls
Bracer of the Debauched

- The following items have had recommended levels added to them:

Fabled Necklace of Superiority
Fabled Rod of Mourning
