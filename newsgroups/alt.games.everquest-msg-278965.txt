I'm a 26 paladin, and I like being a mighty force in the caves, a commanding presence in antonica, a soldier in 
thundering steppes and a scared rabbit in nektulos. I also like the level adjusting dungeons. I think the game should 
have both playstyles because a) the instanced dungeons do allow for instant gaming b) the normal areas offer a depth of 
experience.

That said, I prefer outdoor zones where i can run if it goes bad. 8-]

The boxes are cute but i don't know how to explode the walls yet, i can't target them alas. I hope it becomes clearer later.

Ah well, back to grinding carbon inks!!
