My first character was a Halfling Druid, and I did levels 1-14 in Misty
Thicket cause I was scared to leave without SoW, especially that run through
Kithicor.  Since then I have made about 4 other Halfling characters and love
their newbie zone and city, and I recommend Halfling for all new players to
start off with.
