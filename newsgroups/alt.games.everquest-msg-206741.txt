Perhaps its a server thing, but I ran around half of POK yesterday (OK, 
I ran around the building with the brew barrel, but thats what, 16 
vendors?) and found zero enchanter pages, about 10 words (didn't 
differentiate between mage and necro) and 20 runes.

Of course that could be bad luck and another enchanter just made that 
trip...
