I have eq.serverwide.age:age on autojoin in EQ2, and I have seen one or 
two other folks in there sometimes.  I have been too lazy to look up 
commands, but have not found a way to see who is in a chat channel yet.  
Oddly, it seems that you need the "eq." to make the serverwide channel 
name be accepted, but, I have yet to find a way to communicate with 
anyone on EQ from EQ2.
