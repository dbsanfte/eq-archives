There was a segment on "Nerd Nation" a few days ago that gave a
behind-the-scenes look at call centers in India.  Most of the people there
are college graduates (apparently it is a tought job market there, too).

Part of the training for working in a call center is accent classes, where
they are taught appropriate accents for the region they will be serving
(American, Australian, etc), and taught how to respond so that the person on
the other end won't know they are out of country.

So, next time you call tech support, and get someone who doesn't have a
foreign accent, and isn't confused by your casual references to recent news
in your country--it might be someone in India.  I guess if you want to be
sure, you could say things designed to be offensive to them--talk about how
you enjoy eating cows, and phrase your problem in blasphemous terms ("my
frame rate in the bazaar is as pathetic as an eight-armed god with an
elephant's head")--and see if that gets a reaction. :-)
