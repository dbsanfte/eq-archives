If such practices were common, you would see client crashes resulting, 
rather than mere malfunctioning features. Especially with such a 
significant change as was made to the AA system, do you really think 
that none of the developers even ran the program and triggered the AA's 
to make sure nothing was overlooked that might immediately crash the 
game?

I would agree that *more* testing was warranted, but to make the claim 
that these changes are rolled out with *no* testing is just pure 
sensationalism and blatantly false.

Out of curiousity, weren't these changes rolled out on the test server 
prior to going live?
