   Would it be snide to reply with "How could anyone not see that
I was speaking in the past tense?"

   If you don't know to turn off the height filter, and download
the pre made maps, then yes, it does suck.  And IMHO, it is not
intuitive to do either.  How tough would it have been for the
filter to default to off, and for the maps to have come across
the patcher already filled in?

   But yes, now that I have done both of these things, I like the
map system.
