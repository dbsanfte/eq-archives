Haven't heard anything about Epics yet. There are Heritage quests for things 
like the Screaming Mace and the Manastone, but I've heard nothing on the 
issue of Epics.

One thing I'm reminded of in connection with your message (although it's not 
really responsive) is that all of the class quests are solo instances. That 
is, in order to progress through the various stages of your character's 
existence (citizenship, class membership, sub-class membership), you will 
have to seek out, find, and complete a quest on your own in a solo instance. 
My wife's was hard and she died twice trying it until she figured it out 
(and there is a 45 minute lockout timer on the attempts). These are among my 
favorite events in the game.
