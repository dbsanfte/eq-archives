Since when is the subway the "designated area" for kids to do graffiti?

Cox does not currently carry every service in existance.  Many of them,
probably for good reason.

We've been around this.  That's what I hate about usenet arguments.  Covered
ground isn't ever really covered, since the other side will wait two days
and throw the old argument back up.

Surely you have better things to worry about than whether or not Cox carries
a racist group.  There are starving children, homless animals, and the
rainforest isn't getting any bigger you know.

Access to newsgroups.  No one's entitled to that, they pay for the service
if their ISP decides to offer it.

I think religous bigotry is pretty easily worse.  Anyways, I'm not trying to
get it removed from existance, just the service to which I suscribe.  The
service provided by a company, not the federal government.
