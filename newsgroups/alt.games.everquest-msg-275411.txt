The dictionary has it's uses, but it doesn't cover everything.  You won't 
find the definition for "reactivity" that I'm most accustomed to using, as 
it refers to nuclear power.  This goes along with the Pussy portion of the 
thread.

You're assigning unnecessary context.  They were two separate jabs.  No need 
to make it more complex than it is.

True, if I was going for a imagery like that, it would have been a better 
choice.  Though, as I said, Rappunzel would be the most appropriate choice.

Though I haven't really delved into why we use Cinderella as that particular 
insult, my guess is that it's because, for a few hours, she lived in a 
fantasy world that went away when the dream (metaphorically) was done. 
Either that, or it could be a reference to the current Disney interpretation 
and her "Magic Kingdom" (where, for some reason, there is no blood in the 
shoe).  Though, even there, there is competition with Snow White.  None the 
less, it is often used for someone who's living in a dream land.  Though, it 
may be a more localized thing.

Again, remember the limitations of a dictionary.
