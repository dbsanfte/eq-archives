I'd pronounce it "one toke" i just dont see the drug reference there
initially, after thinking about it for a while, I can see it, but it looks
like an asian name to me.

Yes i know this, but i also know that there are thousands of unimaginative
morons in the game who can't/wont't come up with a unique name. I'd rather
though that they were called someting merely stupid, rather than something
offensive. Bearing in mond of course that the only way you will get rid of
stupid names, is getting rid of the people who made them up. (which is not
such a bad idea) :)
