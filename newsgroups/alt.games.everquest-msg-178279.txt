Way to miss the point.  They were, once second, doing what they loved to do.
The next split second, they were dead faster than nerves can carry the
impulse of pain to their brains.  It is a shame they are dead, but there are
worse much, much ways to go.  I'm pretty sure this is what Magpie had in
mind as well.
