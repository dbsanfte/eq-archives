Obviously you didn't read what I said.. we didn't have to wait for mobs.  We
didn't go in and kill everything and then have to wait 7 or 8 minutes to
kill again.  We had a steady stream of mobs, and I can say that I gained
more xp that way than killing everything and waiting for it all to spawn
back.  Cause when we finished with one mob, there was another mob for us to
take on. Even with KEI people still had to med.  Though instead of killing
everything at once then medding back to full, I've been able to group with
less than 2 minutes between fights.  Tank tanks, casters cast what they must
and stay medding through the whole time.  No one died or came close to
death, and we only had run once when the tank pulled from a floor we're not
able to handle.  We all had fun and most of the group leveled and guess
what?? It was all without KEI!!   See? You can have fun without, now get
over your addiction and move on with your life.
