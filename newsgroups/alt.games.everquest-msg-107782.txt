    I'm not a convert to guilds in general, just mine. We just had a cleric
come over from the other big guild that was just about ready to quit her
cleric from all the abuse they'd pile on healers whenever they'd fail, no
matter why they failed. I read our server message board and know, beyond
doubt, that if it wasn't for the very special guild I've found I still
wouldn't be guilded.

    And yes, Tiru is spoiled. :-)
