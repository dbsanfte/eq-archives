Nerfed.  Try getting to 250 in smithing now.  Heck, try getting to 200, see
what's involved now compared to before.  Pre May 8, you could get to 175 on
banded (relatively cheap), then to 242 I believe on plate.  (Not so cheap,
requires massive farming of pelts and spiderlings).  Now, you can get to 114
I think on banded, and 188 on plate.  So, now, in order to get to the point
of being able to reliably make the good stuff, you have to move on beyond
plate armor for a significant portion of the way.  The smiths who are most
happy about the changes are those that already maxxed out plate, as it keeps
most people from even thinking about competing with them in the high end
player crafted armor market.  If you have boatloads of cash, you can raise
smithing by making the sickle for the PoTC quest, using all vendor bought
materials (Well, you do need some gems imbued).
