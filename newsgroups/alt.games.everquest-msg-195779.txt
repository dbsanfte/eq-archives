When Lanys opened there were Banded Bracers for sale in less than 24
hours.  Now it's true that at that time the BBM Aqua Goblins had not
yet been nerfed, and Fish Rolls were good for 50pp an hour (or more)
instead of 10pp an hour.  But it's also true that it took more skill
then to make Banded reliably.  And Wisps are just as easy now as they
were then (with Druid, at least, you can solo wisps from L9 without
a magic weapon, some casters get it even easier).  And most of the
newbie weapon quests are doable by a pair of L10s, and they yield
decent lowbie weapons.  Clerics and Paladins can still get outfitted
with the SSoL, and the crappy summoned hammers now have Bane dmg
vs. undead, making them not so crappy anymore.

It's a nice theory, and no doubt many who jump in right away will not
like the water and will bail.  Some will wait a few days for the rush
to subside and then show up.  But I expect at least half the server
population to end up being people who've played for less than one
year as of the server opening, and none of them even knew the book to
35, let alone us real old farts who were playing when the book was
forever (I hear in beta they even walled you off from chat, that musta
been really irritating).

The key is to escape from the "tier 0" and "tier 1" newbie zones as
quickly as you can.  Orc 1 won't be as dangerous as you think, by
day two there'll be three groups all claiming it at once, it'll be
like HHP used to be for several days, or so I expect.

I also plan to be there, server openings can be fun (I've done two:
Lanys T`Vyl and Firiona Vie).
