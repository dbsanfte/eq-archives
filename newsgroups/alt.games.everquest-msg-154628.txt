I have been in a really great guild for over a year now. Just recently =
there were some problems between the leaders and a couple of the =
officers. In the end the leaders left and I was voted in as new guild =
leader. I knew that there would be several people that would follow the =
leaders. I was not one of them. I joined the guild for the people there =
not just one or two people. Since then, people have started panicking =
and we have lost most of our members to the guild that our old guild =
leaders went to. We are in no way an uber guild, but we did have quite a =
few high level people on there. The big conflict was never discussed =
publicly and I don't feel that it should have because it was so stupid =
and petty. I have tried to explain to the remaining guild members that =
we will be ok and we will rebuild, but I know that they are scared and =
that is why a lot of them are leaving. Some of them are upset because =
the problem wasn't addressed publicly. We had such a close strong guild =
and a lot of our strong members still remain, but it is the newer =
members that are creating the mass exodus. We have been reorganizing, =
but that can't be done overnight. Some of them are acting very =
impatient. I answer any questions that they throw my way. I feel that =
they need to know the status of the guild is, but it still seems like =
every day more and more people are leaving. Any advice on what to do to =
rebuild and boots morale?
