Starting to get old now.  It was posted from IP Address 146.7.41.11, which
traces to the computer lab at Southewest Missouri State University in
Springfield, MO.  Specifically, it traces to CHKLAB58, which is probably the
name of the machine in the computer lab you used to access the Google site.

Address #3 has been PLONKed.  Don't press it.
