DDR and RDRam did not come out at significantly different times.  RDRam has 
been in use since around 1995 in Nintendo64, became readily available on 
the PC platform in 1999.  DDRam did not become readily available for the PC 
platform until late 2000.  So, age is not the issue with the price.  
Generally, yes, memory prices will come down, but, DDRam will likely always 
be cheaper.
