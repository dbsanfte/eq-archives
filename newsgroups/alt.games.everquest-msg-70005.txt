Sounds almost exactly like my system, cept I use a Voodoo 4 PCI card.
I have all the Luclin models turned off, and it seems to run all right
most of the time, but the Luclin zones have lousy framerate whenever
I'm in a place I can see a lot of the zone, populated or not.  I'm
even noticing severe framerate slowdown in old world zones, including
Halas, fer crying out loud.
