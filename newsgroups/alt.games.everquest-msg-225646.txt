Yeah, well some idiot is bound to do it...oops :�/
Actually, It wasn't a mistake, I was hoping it would give me some options
and one might be "Don't show me this F******* screen again" but it just told
me I had payed for LDoN. /sigh

Oh well, cancelling my accounts anyway. Not because of this, just that
finally a game has got me hooked in a similar way that which EQ did some 3
1/2 years ago.
Maybe not to the same level but enough to realise I am not missing EQ.
So I'll be in SWG, on Chimera :�)

Of course now I have the dilemna of what to do with my old EQ accounts
To sell up or not to sell up....that is the question.
