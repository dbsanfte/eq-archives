First, especially if you're wielding a weapon, get your STA above 100,
that should be priority #1 (if you can keep under weight).  After that
generally you want to work on AC/HP.  Since Velious (and now SoL), there
are some very nice +STA gear options (look for Netted Kelp); the Robe of
Living Fungus is available more now and getting cheaper every day.

AC, STA and HP are generally the most important for monks, although
resists certainly start to become important esp. MR (magic resist) in
higher level encounters.

Everyone has their own formula, mine is generally:

Regen > Haste > AC/HP/STA

1 AC = 6 HP = 1.5 STA

If you're not yet in 50s, STA is less of a factor for the number of HP
you have.  Very few items have Regen, so if you ever find it you should
make whatever accomodations to your current setup to be able to use it.
Your first major purchase as a monk (multi-thousand pp) should be Haste.
Even if you don't have a weapon; weapons are many, haste items are not.

STR directly affects your ATK, and that's also nice since it means
higher damage :).  Benefits from AGI fall off after 120, DEX is a
mystery stat which people feel help their weapons proc more often.  So
for the other stats, I'd go (in order of importance):

STR/MR
AGI (till 120, afterwards I'd rank down to DEX)
CR/FR/PR
DR
DEX
CHA
INT/WIS

You sorta have to strike your own balance.  You may want more HP when
soloing, more STR/resists when not tanking in groups, more AC when
pulling, and so on.  This is all assuming you can keep it below weight.
Nothing is worth going over weight (except maybe regen).

This of course assumes you have choices in gear.  Lower levels, you just
try to do the best you can with what you got, but it helps to always
keep an eye to the future :).
