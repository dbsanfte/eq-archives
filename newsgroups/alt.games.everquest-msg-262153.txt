The undead in Nadox don't see through regular invis for some reason. You can
easily invis up and run all the way to Hate's Fury if you have Run3 or better.
Or if you have a Bard just have him play the DA song while you make the run.

The Treasure Sorter does see through invis, and will cause all the mobs to
aggro, but you're usually well past them by the time they wake up.
