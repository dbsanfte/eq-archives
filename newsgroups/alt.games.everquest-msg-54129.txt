Stay in the Warrior/Raider rooms until 35 or so, then get your butt over to
Velious for some giant or orc slaying in East Wastes or Great Divide

Or go over to Crystal Caverns or Tower of Frozen Shadow now if you have
friends of similar level (no lower than 27 or 28) to go with you, especially
ToFS with it's undead would be heaven for you,  =P.

Or you could go solo or partner cougars in Iceclad ocean now. (partner would
be best though, druid especially, thorns, snare, and heals)
