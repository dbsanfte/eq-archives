Doing that, you will miss two that are dropped.

Cord of Bek'Wen - 31%, Dropped, not sure which dungeon
Valdoon's Immortal Blood Gem - 41%, drops off Valdoon Kel'Novar in MM

Better way is to look up Haste on Lucy, then click on the link for items 
with that effect.

It tells you which dungeon, and how many points as well as what the haste 
percentage is.
