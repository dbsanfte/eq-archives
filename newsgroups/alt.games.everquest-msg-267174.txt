What are you saying? That EQ1 is more engaging?

EQ1 is so unengaging I can play 2 copies at once simultaneously 
effectively, even during a fairly 'hectic' ldon, where time is a factor, 
or during most raids, where being on the ball is a factor.

And lets face it, 2boxxing is the only way to keep EQ1 interesting 
enough for me to even play.
