What Is Your Battle Cry?
                                       Zang! Who is that,
stalking out of the mini-mall parking lot! It
                                        is Splendid One, hands
clutching an oversized scalpel! He
                                                       screams
homicidally:
                                            "I'm going to bruise
you so utterly, you'll
                                                   reincarnate as
an X-file!!"

Speaking of X Files, my absolute favorite ghost story of all time
was the X-File with Ed Asner and Lily Tomlin.  I'm thinking of it
because its Halloween season, but of course what comes to mind is
Lily complaining that he's chosen Christmas Eve as the one day a
year when they can come back and try to make someone so unhappy
he'll kill himself instead of Halloween, and Ed replying "don't
be stupid, who is miserable at Halloween?"

SO enjoy the happiest day of the year guys, I know which X-File
-I- want to come back as.

Splendid
