I've been using these for a couple months now, and figured I'd share 
them, as some of you here might like to try this.

These require a recent release of the Firefox browser (and if you aren't 
using firefox, you'll really want to ask yourself why; I know people who 
have switched just for this :)

Anyhow; in firefox:

Tools -> Manage Bookmarks -> New Bookmark

Cut and paste the following into the dialog box:

Name: Illia's Everquest Bestiary
Location: http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?name=%s
Keyword: eqmob
Description: Search Everquest Bestiary

---

Close the bookmark manager.

Now here's the magic:

In the browser location bar type: 

eqmob <creature>

And press enter.

And voila... the illia's besitiary search results page for the mob. 
(e.g. eqmob gnoll or eqmob cragbeast or eqmob forager)

---

Similiarly I have one set up for items:

Name: Allakhazam's Magical Realm
Location: http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/searchdb.html?iname=%s
Keyword: eqitem
Description: Search Allakhazam's Magical Realm for an item.

And predictably the usage is:
eqitem <item name>

---

Anyhow, I find them immensely convenient, ymmv.
