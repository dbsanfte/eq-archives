Read what you just wrote.  "Knowing that taking a break is going to make it
easier to level".  Easier.  Not faster.  Because, after all, we both know
that if you "stay up all night" you will get a level faster than if you wait
until tomorrow to do it.  It's a psychological trick that players asked to
have played on them.

For some, the "trick" works.  Others don't fool themselves and just take
advantage of it when it's available.

I don't knock the feature, beyond pointing out that, as with EQ itself and
the newly-added "double exp for 1/2 hour a day", it can point to a design
flaw with the game.  Definitely doesn't with WoW, which has a design flaw on
the far other end of the spectrum.
