If you are using it to make dye to make ink to make spell or
ability upgrades then you can buy it from the vendor in the
tradeskill instance.  Spells and ability upgrades are not
affected by the quality of ingredients so there is no need
to buy/craft high quality ingredients if you have access to
cheaper ones.
