    Have you killed any Pickclaw goblins before, like in the new Runnyeye? I
know all my dwarves, AND my high elf enchanter started Indifferent to them.
It really freaks folks out when they see a high elf sitting in the middle of
a fully-popped Raider room, cheerfully making vials of mana - hey, it's the
safest place in the building! Nobody's going to train DOWN to me, now are
they? 8)
