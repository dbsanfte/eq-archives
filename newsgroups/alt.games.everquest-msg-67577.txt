Athalon 1.4GHz, 512MB RAM, GeForce 2 400 MX, WinME.  Running in the
highest screen resolution, high detail, clip plain about 8 clicks up. 
All in all, not too bad performance wise, very playable.  Very poor
framerates in certain parts of the Cat City, and rather annoying short
pauses for short bursts of disk activity can make the view quite
choppy.  Also in about 8 hours of play over the past two nights it
crashed to the desktop twice while looting mobs, and froze once
(hardware reset time) while zoning.

Is this an improvment over the old EQ?  I would say no.  But once they
fix the graphics performance and crashing problems yes!!!

I do wish they would fix the Gamma issue with ATI cards.
