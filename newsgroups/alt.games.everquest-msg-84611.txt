Yep, and how in the hell do you expect to get help at a moments notice if 
you can't just say /guildchat Ragefire UP!  Awoooogggaaaaa, awwwooooggaa!  
All available please come to Skyfire and assist.  Porters, please bring a 
full load!  (OK, other than guilds that use other forms of OOB 
communication, phone-trees, AIM, ICQ, etc, since if you think that 
/guildchat if full of moronic prats, you're probably not going to want to 
talk to them via other methods.
