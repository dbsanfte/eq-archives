I can answer that one easily: People are stupid! In fact, some are
insanely stupid. One time in South Karana, a gnome caster came up
to me and asked me for a SoW. I looked at him and said, "Do you
see my pointed ears and fair complexion? Do you see my plate armor?
Have you ever seen plate-wearing high-elves giving people SoW?" He
had to admit that no, he never had. I noticed then that he ran up
to another gnome and stopped in front of him. I sent that other
gnome a tell, asking if he too were asked for SoW, and he replied
that he had, indeed. This wasn't a newbie either, he was blue to
me, and I was in my late 20s at the time.

Hope this helps,
Rune
