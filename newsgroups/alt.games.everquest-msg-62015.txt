It's good that you understand that a quality case is important.  It's been 
almost 3 years since I bought my case, so I can't remember the name of it, 
but it's huge, has plenty of spots for fans, and you can pull the whole 
motherboard out of it without unseating the cards.  This and the fact that 
all the edges are sanded down to prevent my hands from getting sliced up, 
make me a Happy Camper when I work in it.  I paid $112.00 ( I remember that 
much ) for it, so it was pricey, but well worth it.  It came with a 300watt 
Powerman PS, too.

In years past, I would have told you to not even think about an AMD or 
Cyrix chip because of odd inconsistencies when playing games, but these AMD 
chips that are out now seem to be pretty sweet, especially for the price.  
I personally don't have one, but everyone I know is very happy with theirs.  
As mentioned in Jazz's thread, your motherboard is -very- important.  I use 
ASUS and ABIT boards exclusively and have had no problems with them at all.  
I've only used the ones that handle the Intel chips, though, so I can't 
give any advice on the boards that run the AMD chips.

Your best bet is to go in the these newsgroups and ask questions about the 
newer boards:

alt.comp.periphs.mainboard
alt.comp.periphs.mainboard.abit
alt.comp.periphs.mainboard.asus
alt.comp.periphs.mainboard.msi-microstar
etc..

You should be looking towards the ability to handle the newer chips as they 
come out.  When I bought my ABIT BX6-R2 board 3 years ago ( this coming Feb 
), I was running a Celeron 300a in it.  I was fairly certain that this 
board would last me at least 2 years, and it's still working great with a 
1gig chip in it.  It's going to hold me over until the BigUpgrade(tm) when 
NwN finally hits the shelf.  I'm very happy with the way it has performed 
and the fact that Abit kept releasing BIOS updates for the faster chips.

Post a message in those groups asking them what model board would be good 
for a gamer who will be running a P3, P4, or AMD chip.  If you aren't 
interested in dual-processors and stuff like that, you should mention it to 
pare down the responses that won't pertain to your situation.  I would also 
ask them -why- they suggest a particular MOBO.  The reason I bought my BX6-
R2 was that it handled Celeron chips and had 6 PCI slots.  Different people 
like things for different reasons, and understanding why they recommend 
something is more important to me than the actual recommendation.

I also suggest going somewhere like tomshardware.com and reading on the 
differences between a P3 and a P4.  A P4 may not be for you, depending on 
what you do with your machine.  Someone more hardware savvy ( like 
Valien, Scott H, etc. ) can probably elaborate on that more.

As for memory, make sure you get it from somewhere that guarantees 
compatibility and has a life-time warranty.  I personally don't worry about 
CAS Level 2 -vs- 3, but if you want to get picky, go with 2 for a few more 
bucks. If you buy a quality MOBO, it shouldn't be a problem for them to 
provide you with memory that is going to work.  The good places will -know- 
what kind of memory your motherboard takes if you buy a good name-brand 
one.

Good luck and buy quality parts.
