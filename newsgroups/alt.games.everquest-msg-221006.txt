That's funny... Even through I tend to play in character, Hanrahan *is* 
me. That's exactly how I would be if I had magic powers and lived in a 
world where death is a minor inconvenience. I'm sure that anybody who 
knows me in real life would eventually recognize me in the game. Of 
course, every RPG has an element of wish-fulfillment, and for me it's 
the long red hair and green eyes. :)

Here's his character write-up in the inspection box:

"Hanrahan, Druid of Karana. Famous for running into danger without 
regard for safety, and for running from danger without regard for 
dignity. Rumoured to have chewed his way out of a Griffon once."

Venerable Hanrahan, Storm Warden (Human), Fennin Ro
			
"Man, we're talking *weird* here."
