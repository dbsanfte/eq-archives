Yes.  Ranger has higher skill caps on Offense skill and on weapon
skills.  Also, I believe that at least one of the Ranger's ATK
buffs is self only.

They'll do similar damage only agains mobs that have extremely low or
high AC.  Against any "normal" target (i.e. not deep green and not
ridiculous AC like some Luclin mobs are reported to have) Rangers
outdamage Paladins by quite a substantial margin.  Equipment-wise,
Paladins and Shadowknights have access to 1h weapons with superior
ratios to what Warriors/Rangers/Bards/Rogues get, but they cannot
dual wield and a secondary weapon does far more damage than is
compensated for by the defensive advantage of a shield.  For 2h
weapons, Rangers have historicly been unable to use all but a few of
the better/best 2handers, I was surprised to see Windblade Ranger
wieldable.  Of course, if the itemization of PoP follows the
historical pattern, there must be some absolutely incredible knight
and knight/warrior 2handers in there somewhere.

P.S.  As long as we're talking about Rangers here, I do find it
mildly amusing to consider Dennis' rants about Rangers only getting
bows in PoP in the light of Windblade being Ranger usable.
