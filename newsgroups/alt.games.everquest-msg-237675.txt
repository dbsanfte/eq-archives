Given that it was a pickup group and you weren't familiar with each
other's abilities, I think the ranger was more or less correct.
Most casters probably wouldn't have been able to save themselves,
so the tank was right in trying to save you, and you made that more
difficult by running around.

But I don't think you were wrong either; you had a way to save
yourself and you did it.  Sounds like the only harm was a bit of
frustration on the tank's part, trying to chase the mob down.

Frankly, I'm surprised that aggro-kiting worked in a dungeon.  Was
it in a largish room?
