How many times have you dropped racing moto?  Do you race moto every single
day, summer and winter?  Do you race moto with oncoming traffic, not just
traffic going the same way you are?  Do you race moto in competition with
other vehicles weighing 100 times the weight of yours?  Do the other people
you're racing with suddenly change their mind about where they want to go?
Do you race moto on tracks with arbitrary stops enforced, or with people
randomly pulling into and out of the race?

When do you run the streets, oh great "Rocket"?  I've ridden in floods (2
feet of water on the road), hail, and whiteout.  Do you ride when it rains?
Do you ride when it's so hot that you're stewing in your own sweat, and you
have to stay over 60 or the bike will overheat?  Do you ride with traffic
when there are 20-30 MPH crosswinds trying to push you in front of that
oncoming semi?  Have you taken a curve at 100 MPH and had the front end
start to shimmy, with a 30' drop to the railroad tracks if you lose it?
Have you come around a curve at 70, and found yourself head-on to a sports
car, because the oncoming driver was drifting out of his lane?  Have you
gone through a slalom at 50 with dump trucks in front and behind, and if the
guy in front brakes, you're gonna be a blood pancake?  Have you ever done a
lane shift at 50 and hammer your brakes because the semi ahead of you is
smoking down and you're wondering which way he's gonna jacknife?

Have you been pushed off the road by a drunken jackass in a pickup?

Riding (for me) is a hobby just like breathing's a hobby.

Your idiot friend GetSumJ called me a Biker.  He's wrong.  I'm a Rider.  The
difference between Biker and Rider is the difference between being a person
who rides and a person who *must* ride.  In this city are 2 gangs of Hell's
Angels wannabes.  Also in this city are 2, maybe 3 riders.  When the weather
gets foul, they stop; we don't.

Ask the professional race car drivers; some of them are more afraid of
driving in traffic than they've *ever* been driving on the race track.
Motocross is nothing.



1) Gravel on the UBC parking lot.
2) Black ice about 1/2 inch thick on a hill.  So slick you couldn't even
walk on it.
3) Wet asphault on a curve.
4) Oil dribbled down the inside lane.
5) Pulling away from a filling-station island (lost balance, reason
unknown).
6) Oncoming vehicle pulled an illegal left turn (my first legal vehicular
kill).
7) Hit an ice ridge.
