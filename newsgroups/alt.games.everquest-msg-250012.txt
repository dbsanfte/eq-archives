I guess it's safe to say that they want to further make the game
tailored to high-end raiders, seeing as how their "top priorities"
deal with maybe 10% of the playerbase.

Shame on them for not addressing the REAL reason that most of the

And if it's a result of the input given from those attended, shame on
them.
