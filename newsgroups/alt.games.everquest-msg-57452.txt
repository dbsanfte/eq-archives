I think it is some kind of memory problem now. Last night while I was on a
naggy raid I noticed that the hard drive light was blinkin every few seconds
even when I'm just sitting there! This is something that has never happened
before. It does not happen on my old P2 300 whats wrong with this new PC?
its got 1100mhz P3 40GB Ultra ATA 100 HD it should not be doin this!

Anyone ever have this problem?
