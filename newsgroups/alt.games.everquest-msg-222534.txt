Pure and simple?  The camera sucks!  It doesn't matter, to me, that EQ 
was designed a purely a first person perspective.  The only time I 
really use the camera is when I'm fighting, or sitting waiting to 
heal(sigh), and I want to keep an eye out for any blind side attacks. 
And don't even think about trying to loot the corpse while using the camera!
