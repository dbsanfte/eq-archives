Platinum, Gold is just NWN plus SOU, Platinum also includes HOTU.

Surely he's more fun in HOTU?  My kids and I are still likely to perk up 
our ears and say "Deekin?" when asked to do something, or to break into 
the Doom song when out christmas shopping with the wife

I don't agree with this one at all, you can use brute force (which I 
guess is what you are talking about taking too long, but it doesn't take 
all that long if you have a high damage attack; plinking away with a 
small weapon when part of each hit is eaten by damage reduction does 
take forever) or you can use magic, or you can use a henchman or 
familiar with lockpicking ability.  If you really can't stand it, you 
can even cheat and create an item with the ability to cast knock at will 
on it.  Throwing away 4 levels of every character in order to have 
relatively crappy lockpicking skills isn't an ideal solution... 
characters with some rogue aren't bad by any means, but using that 
approach every time is limiting.

This is true of the original campaigns, but you've missed the best part 
of NWN, which is that there's player created content out there, 
literally hundreds of campaigns in all different flavors.  Most of them 
are relatively small, the size of one chapter of the original modules 
sold with the game, but some are even larger in scope, and some are 
built on a "persistant world" model, where things respawn behind you and 
you certainly can come back to places you've been before.

I haven't tried this yet, but its possible to multiplayer NWN, to do 
DM'd NWN, and most of the Persistant World campaigns are run online as, 
well, mMOG; Mediumly Multiplayer Online Games, with dozens of people 
playing at once running around in different directions doing different 
things alone or in groups, interacting with each other occaisionally.
