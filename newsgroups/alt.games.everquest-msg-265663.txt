I am imagining the memo that went out internally at Blizzard:

RE: Release date for W.o.W.

As you know, we've been competing for mindshare with EverQuest II's 
virtually simultaneous release. We've been under the impression thus far 
that the inherent strength of that title was going to force us to release 
sooner than we would have preferred and, accordingly, we've had Nov 9, Nov 
16, and Nov 23 all lined up as contingent dates. We're happy to report based 
on what we've seen of the current state of their beta that we have all the 
time we need. We can now safely hold off and release on Nov 23, 3 days 
before the busiest Christmas shopping day of the year. Merry Christmas 
everyone, knock yourself out polishing the game these next few weeks. This 
means bonuses under all the trees!
