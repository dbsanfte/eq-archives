EQTrader.com shows it is incomplete and may not even exists in the
game:
http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=10169&menustr=035000000000

Allakhazam site doesn't have a listing for aerated mineral water at
all.  A thread here points out that aerated water doesn't seems to
exists either: http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=14931

Here's another site with the info on recipe that required nonexistient
item: (from http://www.rpgexpert.com/3170.html)

5) Tradeskill recipes with missing ingredients

There are a number of recipes in the game that seem to be missing
ingredients to make them. Some have come to light with the new
tradeskill UI:

    Fizzle Pop (missing aerated mineral water)
[snip list of other problem recipes]

These are all recipes that are shown in the new UI that nobody has
been able to locate the items to actually combine in game.


Google search have turned up a few hits on aerated mineral water, all
of them noting that aerated mineral water doesn't seems to exist at
all.
