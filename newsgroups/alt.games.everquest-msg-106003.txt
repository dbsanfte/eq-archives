Ok, so here the gloves come off.  I'm not sure what your concept of research
is, but in most reputable fields, it doesn't include hammering the data to
fit your pre-concieved notions, and slandering your opponents (not that
those tactics aren't used in many modern "scientific" pursuits, but that's
another story).  None the less, we will continue to show your bias.

> (I simply cannot imagine what they think Defense skill

Judging from your own data, I would say that Defense is responsible for the
25% decrease in the Dmg/Hit catagory.  Hmm, that may be why they called it
Defense, instead of Evasion.  That would still leave level as a possible
(and likely) cause for the drop in hit percentage.  I hope that helps yout
figure out what we think the defense skill does.

> does, to keep bleating about "level", especially when I

Ah, yes, "bleating" got to love the even handedness with which you evaluate
theories which conflict with your own.  Lends alot of creedance to your
test.

Nor do you have any indication that it doesn't.  Funny how that works both
ways.  Furthermore, you overlook the indications in your very own tests that
would suggest it.  Why don't you just come out and say that you don't want
to believe that there are innate benefits of level build into the melee
system?
