A bard should always look for the operation that will best support the
group.  There have been times when my haste and slows were not as good as
what the group had already so I stood back with drum and chants.  Certainly
better damage than I would have given with sword and chants and sometimes I
actually took aggro away from the MA.  Nowadays I have better melee and
stackable haste so I always melee.  Except when I mez.  I could still melee
with one mez, but then the haste would have to drop.  So if it's just me and
a paladin meleeing then I melee and mez, but if we have decent melee then I
twist and mez.
