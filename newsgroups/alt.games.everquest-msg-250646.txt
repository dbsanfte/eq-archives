The problem is memory usage. On my home system with all options turned on
and textures set to high EQ and W2K running chews through 800mb+. If I then
go through and turn off all the luclin models, set textures to low, turn off
all graphical options and sound, W2K and EQ runs at just a tad over 400mb.
You just need to make sure you have enough memory to be running 2
instances - performance will become unacceptable if you start using swap
space.

On my box at home (specs below) the performance is actually very good and
perfectly playable, and you just ALT-TAB between the two applications. Once
you ALT-TAB to the alternate window, an immediate ALT-Enter maximises that
window to full screen. Ie, you can play full screen, it is just by default
you are set to windowed modem when ALT-TABbing between the two clients. You
don't need to wait for the screen to load either, a quick ALT-TAB followed
immediately by a ALT-Enter brings up the new screen in less than a second or
two.

As a further tip - I leave the sound turned on on the 'primary' account I am
playing. I also have EQ running from distinct directories, ie D:\EQ2 and
D:\EQ3 which are just complete complete copies of each other. Shortcuts to
the appropriate eqgame executable are on the desktop. My standard D:\EQ
directory is EQ with all the options turned on for when not using two
accoutns at a time, so in total I have 3 instances of EQ installed on my
machine and 3 seperate shortcuts on the desktop.

Machine Stats:

Asus P4C800-e Deluxe
P4 3.2Ghz Canterwood core
1gig Corsair PC3200 Ram
Asus Geforce FX5700 256mb GPU
2x 120Gig 7200rpm  Raid 0
SB Audigy2 zs

PS - When I throw a second gig of Corsair Ram in her she should be able to
run two instances of EQ with all the options enabled. I have also heard
issues with ATI GPU owners not having such a easy time alt-tabbing. But,
everyone know, ATI for performance, Nvidia for stability. You can't have
your cake and eat it too.
