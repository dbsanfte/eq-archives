    There's this really neat trick you can do in crowded areas, where you
can jump on top of someone and not fall back to the ground because of all
the players in the area. As of SoL, I believe this will be called "Vah Shiir
crowd surfing". Enjoy! 8)

    On a more serious note, I really hope people who just want to play a
Beastmaster do the sensible thing and start one of the other races that can
be Beastmasters, rather than Vah Shiir. There's a lot of people that want to
be cats, and the crowding WILL be terrible.

    James
