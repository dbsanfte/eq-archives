It's not that big an article.  You could at least have read it first, so you
wouldn't have to guess which EQ economy he is talking about.  Of course he's
talking about the "through eBay and such" economy!

You read that?  And apparently believe it too . . . but you couldn't be
bothered to read the article referenced by the original poster before you
had your little fit?

The article says the scientist was from the economics department of Cal

insight into cancer research that specialists in that field do not have.  I
suspect it's just that your reading comprehension sucks ass.
