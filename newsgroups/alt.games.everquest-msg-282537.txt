It appears the servers were taken down Saturday, January 21 for maintenance. 
Shortly after they came back online the Stromm server crashed.  When Stromm 
came back online the players were not receiving double exp as promised this 
weekend due to the patch problems earlier in the week.  It is now 24 hours 
since the crash and still no double exp.  Everyone's doing petitions and bug 
reports but so far there's been no response indicating anyone's acknowledged 
the problem.
