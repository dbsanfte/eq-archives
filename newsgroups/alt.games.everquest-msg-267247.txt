Allakahzam already has a pretty good list of various quests already. You can
sort by level and check out the loot you get. I was dinking around in there
last night and it looks like there are a few you can do solo and some other
good ones that need a group.

I have only played a little on my daughters system because mine isn't good
enought to run it, so I don't quite understand the differences in the stats
and stuff so I can't really recommend a specific quest or item at this
point.

Oh! I just remembered, check the Shamans Crucible too. They have a forum for
EQ2 discussion and you can probably get some good tips there.

Pass on what you find out, if you don't mind. I'm going to start a Shaman
once I get my comp upgrades.
