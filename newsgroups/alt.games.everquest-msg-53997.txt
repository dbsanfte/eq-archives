Yep. I'll be damned. According to Copeland's, the CSL in the primary
comes out to 258 dmg/min but the slightly slower BAL in primary bumps it
up to 288.  Not huge, but a significant enough difference that you'd
definitely want to equip them that way.

Even taking it up to a level 55 warrior, the BAL in primary gives you
576, while the CSL in primary gives you 562. The gap closes, but the BAL
in primary still wins out. (Of course, what you'd be doing with those
weapons at level 55 I have no idea.)

Just to be silly, I bumped the warrior up to 60 and it was still 623 to
633 with a 10 pt/min advantage to the BAL in the primary.

Another perfectly good theory shot to hell. <g>
