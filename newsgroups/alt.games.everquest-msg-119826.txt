Yes, I can see that Valdelmar didn't speak in guildchat.  I also see
what I read that led to my misremembering him as having done so:
Ralanan was summonned to Arena about a minute after he says "strange
they didn't summon me to arena" in guildchat.  Following that several
comments akin to "haha ral they reading /gu" and finally "Eli we always
knew they could read it".

Also, it was not a kangaroo court, there were no "proceedings".  They
were summonned there to be informed of their punishment, which had
already been determined.  Supposedly Jeff Butler had observed them
cheating and decreed that their raid be aborted, all of the involved
characters suspended, any previously suspended characters banned, and
the guild disbanded.  Itzlegend's attempts to defend their actions
appear to have convinced Valdelmar to delay the character and guild
bannings until Verant's logs could be completely parsed, this even
though he had apparently been ordered by his superiors to execute the
full punishment immediately.
