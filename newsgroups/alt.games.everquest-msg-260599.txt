The only place I think they're worth it is level 65 hard.    I've seen one
good augment drop there, and heard that another did.  (Didn't believe them
until we got our own drop).

The one we received was all slots / all slot types augmentation that granted
ultravision.  (had this drop last night.)

The one I heard of but wasn't there for was an augment that was belt slot
only / all slot types.  36 percent haste.
