Did. I get the verbose info, but the /renew and /release options tell me 
that no adapters are in a mode that permits them. I suppose I should 
stop the network first and try again, but I'm getting the feeling that's 
what the "repair network" option on the graphical interface does, and it 
hasn't made a difference.
