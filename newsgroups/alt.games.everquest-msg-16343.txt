There is definitely city wear and combat wear in AO.  You'll see the biggest
baddest-armored heaviest-weapon brunt come out of a mission door and in less
than five seconds change into the funkiest outfit they dug out of treasure
chests.  AO really should have a macro that you can click on that switches
you between your city clothes and combat gear.  :-)

And you never hear anyone brag about getting a mission that will give the
best armor for the quest item, but you will hear them shout and literally
watch them do the happy dance (there's a lot of dance moves in AO) when
they've got a mission that will get them a leopard-pattern bathrobe.  That
and everyone asking which type of mission gave that so they can repeatedly
try to get the same prize.  It's silly.  It's funny.  It's AO's biggest
saving grace.  :-)
