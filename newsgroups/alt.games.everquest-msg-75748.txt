So, if your druid needs a rez, it's your fault for not playing a Cleric?

Remind me to tell that to all the clerics in the zone next time you need a
rez (I've never been charged for a CR, but I always put the money in the
trade box... some times they accept, sometimes they don't).  After all, it's
your own fault for taking more of a mob than you can handle.  Sorry, but
that just seems too condescending.

Granted.  Take it even farther, to say "I don't owe you a TP or a Sow.  I'm
doing this because I think it's proper, but I don't OWE it to you."

Some are, some aren't.  About the only time I ask for a SoW is when I'm
leaving the group for the night (esp if I have to cross the FV run of doom),
and then only if I'm going through a rough area.  Many times I'm out of my
way because that's where they decided to fight, and I think it could be said
that I've contributed more to their character than that little chunk of mana
is worth (true, I did benefit as well).

That's fine, though it seems a bit condescending.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
