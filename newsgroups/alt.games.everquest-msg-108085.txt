Until level 34 and VOS, a necro cant dish out the damage fast enough, even
counting pet. Wizards are also poor damage dealers over time, and I have the
same dislike for them. They also contribute little to the stability of a
group... without healers and tanks, the group tends to fall apart and not
function well. (Yes there are exceptions, but somehow it never happens in
pickup groups)

As an enchanter, I want to be able to buff people up and strengthen our
party. The more people I can buff, the more I am adding. Necros tend to buff
their own pet, and not want clarity, so it stops me being able to contibute
by a little bit. otoh I love to group with mages and bl's, but only if they
can control their pet. (always call off pet and reattack when you are hit by
a mob that is later mezzed). I would like a /petdefendme switch (stops pet
attacking something automatically when it hits you), but I guess this is
verants way of making the game hard.
