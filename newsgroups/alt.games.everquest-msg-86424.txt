Plus the fact that if you get the person to state the terms of the MQ
beforehand, and then do the turn-in, if they stiff you it is able to be
/petitioned and /reported as in-game fraud.

Had a person try this with a rogue in my main's guild, who said
he had a Kedge robe (it's no drop, so you can't really "prove"it
if you can't put it on), and was paid 15kpp cash for it up front.

He went with him to WK, and gave Vilnius a chunk of meat or
something, and the rogue turned in his 3 robes to "are you
forgetting something?"

It was /reported and found out that the guy didn't have a kedge
robe to offer, and my friend got his robes and his money back.
I don't know what happened to the scammer, but it IS something
that verant looks down upon when somebody doesn't live up
to an agreement.
