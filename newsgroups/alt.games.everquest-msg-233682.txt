I made my first trip to HoH just to check things out a little bit.  I didn't
go far in because wandering blind around PoP can get you killed fast.  I
have a map, but want to know how far I explore in HoH invised.  My second
question is what are the camp sites and abbreviations?  I felt like quite
the newbie in PoV when someone shouted, "Mage to OC" and I had to ask, "OC?"
