...that is actually safer to run through than OT->FM or dodging
spiders in FV. At level 20-ish, the only kobolds that aggro are those
in the king room and beyond, which is only about the last 1/3 of the
run. With pathing in the Warrens, training for that part of the run
isn't so bad.

With a SOW, it's no problem at all.
