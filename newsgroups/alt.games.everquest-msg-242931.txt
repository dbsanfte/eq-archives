Hmmm - let me try to recall the exact numbers.

I was a 58 magician pl'ing my 'chanter.  I was using the
/pet get lost method and thought I needed to get him to 
39 (39 * 1.5 = 58.5) to group and get xp.  When he turned
38 I conned him and he was cyan, grouped him and he got
xp.

If you say it doesn't work, then I believe you.  It worked
for me a couple years ago.
