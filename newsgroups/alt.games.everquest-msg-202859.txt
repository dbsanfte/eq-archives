I decided from the start that both my ranger and my SK would be dedicated
ground-pounders.  I've never asked for ports when playing them (except when
the guild is raiding and we're all getting rides), and it's made for some
very interesting trips ... particularly with the Ogre SK.  I've learned back
ways to get from Point A to Point B that I'd have never known existed ...
found a hunting spot or two along the way as well.

Having said that, I wouldn't want to do it regularly with all of my
characters.  It's also made for long, boring runs.  Katta -> Tenebrous ->
Grimling -> Hollowshade -> Shar Vahl -> Shadeweaver's -> PoK is not a run I
really want to make over and over again.
