Ever tried parsing logs?  Maybe for an *optimal* group, you don't need a
Wizard, or a Wizard won't pull their weight, but not all groups are optimal.
Many times, you are better off taking a suboptimal group *now* instead of
waiting and hoping for an optimal group later.

Soon after Velious came out, I, a high 30's Wizard, went to explore
Velkator's with a mid 50's Cleric, a mid 50's Ranger, and a 50 Paladin.
I've analyzed the logs from those fights, and the damage output was
distributed something like this: 40% came from the Ranger, 30% came from me,
and 30% came from the Paladin.  I was regulating my mana usage such that I
was medding about as much as the Cleric.  Note also that I could not use my
best nuke, because it was ice-based, so was operating at less efficiency
that I normally would have.

As far as DPS goes, let's calculate.  I seem to med about 25 mana a tick.
My best nukes are about 3:1, and cast in 3.0 seconds, so I can nuke without
losing a med tick, if I time it right, but even if I lose a med tick at each
cast, I make it up with Harvest, so let's just stick with 25 mana/tick.
That means over time, I can do 75 damage/tick, or 12.5 DPS.  Yeah, that
seems kind of low.  However, that's not my job.  My job is to do a lot of
damage fast on the harder mobs, not produce steady damage on the easy ones.
I can do over 100 DPS for about a minute, and have a wide variety of spells,
so that I've usually got something that will get around the mob's resists.
(If I have to, I've got lures, but they aren't as mana-efficient, so the DPS
will drop by about 1/3).
