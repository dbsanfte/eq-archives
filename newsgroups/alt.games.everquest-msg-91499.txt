Saturday afternoon US time ? There should be quite a few people on.
I was on last night 6 till 7 GMT and there were 10 - 20 players in each
of the Qeynos area zones (NQ, Qhills, BB)

If you want to play your dwarf then level up to 6 and relocate to Gfay.
The problem that no one else has mentioned is language.
As a dwarf you will have some trouble talking to others.
I think that this is why you see more people round the human centers.

HTH,

Jim
