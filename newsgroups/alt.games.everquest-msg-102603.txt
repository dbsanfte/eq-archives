It's not. Don't be putting up strawmen. You're part of a group but
that doesn't mean you can demand things of other people. You are no
more important than they are.

*Request*. And be prepared for negative responses.

That example is more about annoying me with pointless requests and
making me switch spell slots for no reason. Other exxamples are more
about mana. Either way, the point is the same - I decide which spells
to cast, end of story.
