Maybe because they feel it will cheapen the game for many players.
Sure it will be easier, melee's would now have full gate, Duel someone, die,
back at bindspot with all your equipment.
DAoC does not have CR's because they do not suit the game, the death penalty
is harsher than EQ in other ways (although you can never suffer level loss)
but have CR's in RvR would just stop many from doing RvR.
AC does have CR's, you respawn with most of your equipment but lose your
most expensive items (left on your corpse) and these do not last anywhere
near as long as they will in EQ.
I hate CR's they are what make me "fear" death, exp penalties I do not
really care about, if I die but no the CR is easy it's just a minor hiccup
and am just as happy with a Revive as I am with a Res.

From what I read EQ2 will have a cross between DAoC and AC's death penalty
and as for Exp deficit, this is just hiding the loss from you, a better idea
but it's still the same penalty.

Anyway EQ2 is another game entirely on a whole new engine and won't be
released for at least 18months, on top of this it appears to be have only
name and location in common with it's predecessor. The idea of EQ2 is to
make a whole new game and not repatch EQ (an already over patched game) to
change it into a new game.
