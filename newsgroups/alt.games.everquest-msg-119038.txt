Heck a rogue with Mrylokar's Gloves can do it.

I was picking on some guildees canceling their mez
spell in L. Guk the other day.  It was strickly in fun,
and they thought it was hilarious (if anybody had
really been in danger, no, I wouldn't have done it).

"Snare that one!"
"I DID!"
"Why's it running?!?"
