<yawn is an understatement>

[some garbage clipped, took out the starcraft NG since this is about EQ]


    Perhaps you should practice on your flaming techniques, before actually
flaming.   I am almost positive that most senior members of this newsgroup
are far too witty for your feeble attempts.

    Thirty seconds of poking around revealed the following from yourself I
might add:  "I've found that I can't admire a man without being gay or a
girl without being a stalker."

    Needless to say, I found this interesting aside from the fact that I
damn near smacked my head on my desk laughing so hard.  If anything, thanks
for the laugh.  This will be my only and last contribution to this
(ever-growing) thread.
