You may work Monday through Friday, I am off on Tuesdays, a friend of mine
is off on Wednesdays, I know someone else off on Thursdays.  A guy I work
with works Wednesday through Saturday so he is off and could have 3
consecutive days of EQ.  If you include 6 hours sleeping time, the half hour
to get home, half hour to get back, half an hour after getting home and
before going to work, that leaves him about 59 hours on a 3 day time period
to play EQ.
    I am not married, don't date, don't get out much, and work 42 hours a
week (8x4 + 10), 30 minutes a day (total) getting to and from work, plus my
30 minutes lunch each day, along with 6-8 hrs sleep each night, this leaves
me about 60 hours a week I could play EQ if I wanted to.

Again, see above statement.  Why limit someone because they did so well in
such a short time?  Maybe that day you worked was their day off?  Maybe they
also got lucky, was in a group fighting reds and didn't die much, if at all?
Maybe they're on vacation and don't do much other than stay home and have
the time for EQ?

If you're going to limit only a character, why have a limit at all?  If the
whole point is to limit playing time, why limit a character?  What if they
only enjoy that character?  What if they play that character but use so much
of their time making EQ their social life, that they level VERY slowly (like
take 3 weeks real life time to hit LV10...AFTER the speedy leveling that was
recently added for pre-LV10 players)?
