First level capped froglok was like 26 hours. I remember when Morell 
Thule came out (new fresh non-split land of a server), we had a mage 
solo his way to 60 (cap at the time) in about a week or so. Mind you, he 
was online 24 hours a day... I understand he had 5 people playing him.
This was about 'Velious was new' era, maybe a bit before.
