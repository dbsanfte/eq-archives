This is not accurate in general.  I've handed in Necromancer POF armor as a
dwarf
cleric of Brell.  Wrong class (cleric) wrong race (no dwarf can ever be a
necromancer)
wrong religion (there are no brell worshipping necromancers) and still I got
decent exp
and a raw diamond.

I've heard that the Iksar Warrior only armor from POH does not work for hand-in
even by Iksar Warriors, but perhaps this was incorrect, and I don't know of any
case where an Ikky War has tried to hand in any other class armor so I can't
say if, for example, they can't turn in that Necro gear I was successful with.

This armor drops a lot in POF while clearing for the bosses to get epic drops
for people, its nice that it no longer all rots... we treat it as FFA loot now
unless there's a lowbie alt along that specifically wants something, for most
its all been trash for a long time.
