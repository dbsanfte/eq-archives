2 boxing and looking for hints or tips to powerlvl my 40 orge warrior with a
61 cleric.

Looking for zones to hunt in and any hints and tips.

Basicly I buff with AGEO and heal warr as needed. Any other buffs that I
should throw on the war that stack with ageo ?

Been hunting in COM , Dreadlands, DSP & Lguk. I have all expansions

Looking for someplace that the mobs dont have 3 tons of hit points which is
most of the moon.
