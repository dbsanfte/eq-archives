What do you mean Elder Wurm? Is it Elder Dragon you talk about, never heard of
any Elder Wurm language.

How have you managed to train all your languages up to master? The normal race
ones are easy enough, but languages like Orc and Fairie are damn hard to get up.
Have basic in them, but dont know how to get it any higher. Got any tips on
language learning?

Im master in the following myself:
Common (of course)
Elvish
Erudian
Teir'Dal
Troll
Ogre
Thieves Cant
Combine
Dragon
Dark Speech

And am excellent in Elder Dragon.



So if anyone on Veshaan is language interested, im always looking to trade
languages, so if you have one of the languages im not master in (need it at
master level of course), ill be happy to trade you with one of my languages.
