Just last night, in BoT, I was the only haster and slower in a melee 
heavy group.  I asked if 50% group haste would be good enough vs 60% 
individual haste.  Got no complaints, made keeping them hasted less mana 
costly, and faster to rebuff.  Of course, in part it was probably 
attitude, I didn't tell them you get this 50% and you will like it, I 
explained why it would be easier and more efficient to do it that way.
