Thats kind of true, but its mitigated by two facts:
	1, technical - EQ2 is designed for far smaller guilds
	2, personal  - I'd prefer to have a new real healer we've made
	friends with, and a PL/twink 'free' world. Forcing people to
	play up alts with only minor PLing (twinking is still possible)
	also means you're exposed to peoples alts, and keeps the 'low
	level game' alive. 

I've met lots of people in EQ2 who are just alts of higher level players
at the moment. Still, tis early days and we'll see how it pans out. EQ1
dropped a lot of the stuff I liked , and fixed a lot of the stuff I
loathed as it evolved. EQ2 will doubtless do the same; I just hope it
doesnt arcadify in the same way.
