On the contrary, son.  In that single post I pointed out 
several spots where you had clumsily dodged specific challenges 
to explain the holes in your paranoid theories, several places
where you had employed nothing but the straw man and
ad hominem fallacies in reply to points argued against
your whacko beliefs, punched a hole in your silly
implication that the US consumes world resources without
providing something in exchange for them, pointed out
that you had dodged *earlier* attempts to get you to
explain the apparent holes in your screed, pointed out
where you had employed a false dichotomy fallacy,
identified several spots where you were engaging in
classic empty liberal sloganeering instead of developing
a case for your position, provided a counterpoint to
your assertion that US public services are in a "sorry
state", specifically answered a question you posed about
why *else* we might be doing what we're doing (which you
ran away from dealing with), gave you a URL to a lengthy
article which point-by-point dismantles a lot of the
arguments you have given here, and finally gave up on
*you*, only to have you then play the lame "you can't 
fire me, I quit" card.

If that's not "anything of substance", Sparky, if that's
not anything you need to rebut in order to salvage a
shred of your credibility, then I think we've identified
the source of your problem -- you're blind.  Or stupid.
Or dishonest.  Or some combination thereof.

Try to stay on track, Sparky.  The point is that whether it's
allegedly "true" or not (and that's HIGHLY debatable), it's still
quite "patronising and insulting", so you're a blazing hypocrite
for whining about anyone else returning the favor.

Are you *really* this obtuse?  Or was that just a clumsy
attempt to change the subject in the hopes that no one would
notice?  Nice try...

Not my point, but I'm used to things sailing over your head.
But what's hysterically ironic is that you say this,
then *immediately* follow it up with:

>> With you no longer preaching your belligerent ignorance

>Possibly...but only because ignorance is bliss.

...which is the epitome of "I know you are but what am I"...

Even though you're a complete waste of time intellectually
you're definitely good for comic relief.

But the joke's getting old fast.
