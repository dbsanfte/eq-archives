Uncommon drop off a plentiful and over camped spawn...

Also worth looking into is Gnome skin armor, or Tizmak, or if you're daring,
head to velious and check vendors in Iceclad and Thurgadin for Ulthork
(especially arms). Also auction for tizmak when you're in Great Divide, you
should be able to get a piece or two.  (arms, legs, normal BP and cured BP
are the common pieces, there's a rare drop gloves off of the named Tizmak
though, but they're overly expensive for you, legs and arms are 8ac each,
normal BP is 12 ac I think, and cured BP is 15 ac 7sv magic)

Or you could just get all the split paw pieces, cheap as dirt if you go over
to South Karana, tunic, belt, gloves and mask as I remember.

There's also a few quests you can do, such as the part of the screaming mace
that gives you the Prayer Cloth of Tunare, 3ac 3wis shoulder item, all you
need for it is a bracer of battle from Crushbone.
