That's the thing about Paladins, they're not really supposed to have a class
defining skill (other than LoH).  We are the true jack of all trades, and
while not master of any, still pretty high when it counts.  We make
excellent tanks (not as good as warriors, but good enough to be an
acceptable alternative), we dish out good damage, we can pull back and heal
if neccessary, our stuns can keep a caster knocked.  All in all, a Paladin
is a good dose of everything that's neccessary that can go right into the
thick of things.

Think of it this way.  A cleric is a field hospital, while a Paladin is the
battlefield dressing kit.  While the surgeon with the hospital is much more
effective in patching people back up, it's the corpsman with the dressing
kit that saves the lives for the surgeon to work on.

On top of that, at higher levels, the paladin comes into her own as a
priest.  We may not be able to match a cleric, but we do enough to keep have
a definate use in the field.

So, in a paladin's case, it's not that she is the best at any one thing that
defines the class, but that she's versitle enough, and good enough at what
she can do, to change the nature of a fight.
