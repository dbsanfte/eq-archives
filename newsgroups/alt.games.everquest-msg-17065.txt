Some level 30 ideas.
Yes, you could stay in High Keep for several more levels in the
Warrior/Raider rooms, though I left the keep at 30.
Since your a paladin, you're not evil, but the Overthere is outstanding
to start getting into fast xp groups on the ledge. Sadly, you'll have to
go to FV to bank, etc. since you can't get into the outpost, but helpful
groupmates might help you out there.
But if you're in the neighborhood anyway, FM is closer to FV than the
OT, and you're at a ripe level to hit the giant fort there. Easy to get
groups and the xp and loot are pretty good.
If you can hook up with a healer type partner (no, I don't think you're
*that* good of a healer <grin>) you could try going to Najena for a few
levels and work on the GB quest skellies, or to BB for the crazed
goblins. (Generally camped, though.)
