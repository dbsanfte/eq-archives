Food poisoning I have had before and while painful and unpleasant is hardly 
ever lethal, AFAIK, however they would most likely become very ill.  The con 
is you wouldnt know who is taking the lunches but the pro is that they would 
probably stop taking food that doesnt belong to them and also they would 
miss a few days work probably w/o pay.
