I used a torch dropped in Najena off the DE mages.  Considering which server
you're on, I don't know if that's an option for you.  If you can, wander
into Najena, there's a mage very close to the entryway.  Kill mage's pet,
kill mage.  It will drop nothing 90 percent of the time.  Wait patiently;
when the mage respawns kill it before it casts a pet and 50 percent of the
time it will drop a torch, stein, broom, or shovel - apparently it destroys
same when it casts pet.

Bon Appetit.

Eijenhar,
51 mage
