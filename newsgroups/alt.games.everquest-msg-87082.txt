Given that I have not noticed any "sweet" spots as such, no I have never
tried it.  Some tradeskills appear to be far easier to improve in than
others.  Some tradeskills appear to get more difficult at high levels.  I
have found the Pottery, Brewing, and Fletching all appear to be very easy to
raise.  Alchemy and Smithing are not bad, but definitely appear to be
harder.  Tailoring I don't have very high yet, but I have heard is a real
bitch, particularly at high levels.  I have not tried Jewelcraft at all yet.

Personally, I would much rather the reward item was not NODROP, because I
want to be able to sell it, make money, and make more of them.
