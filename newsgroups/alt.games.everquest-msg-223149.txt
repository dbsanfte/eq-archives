Ive been hunting in PoM a bit lately and zoned in last night (11/6/03)
and it was radically different. I never hunted there before the
revamp, so Im not really sure, but... did they UN-revamp the zone? The
few mobs I saw near the zone in were indifferent to me and appeared to
be different. There wasnt much around in the forest area, I believe a
few groups there had cleared it. I know that PoM old timers were
really upset (understandably so) about the revamp. SOE has had a habit
of late of sanitizing unique zones and making them all carbon copies
of each other. Did they finally listen to players and revert it back
to the way it was? Interesting that they didnt announce it in any
form.
