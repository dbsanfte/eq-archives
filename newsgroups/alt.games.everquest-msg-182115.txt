You know, I felt that way for quite a while, but, it doesn't take me all
that long to go from oom to fm, full health, without KEI.  Those of you that
still have to sit around on your butts to get mana back probably still feel
that way about it though.  Mind you, it's still nice to have, and does speed
things up, but nowhere near as much as it did pre level 58.
