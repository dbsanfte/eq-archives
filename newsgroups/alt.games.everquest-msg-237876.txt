Either life is meaningless or it isn't. This isn't a choice the
end-user gets to make free will or not. Of all the permutations...
only one is signficant... 

That life does have meaning, that there is free will, and I that I
choose to search for it.

Otherwise...
If life does have meaning, and I have free will, but choose to decide
its meaningless then I've wasted it.

If life doesn't have meaning then its all moot search or not.
If there is no free will then its all moot because its meaningless,
and my decision to search or not search doesn't matter.

So... what is the difference between meaninful and meaninless life? If
its meaninful and you search for it... you might find it. That is the
point. Maybe its to find God. (Figured god needed re-introduction to
this topic named for him) If you could have searched for it and didn't
you squandered it. If it turns out its meaningless you didn't waste
anything because the whole thing was pointless... if it turns out you
didn't have free will ... well then again the whole thing is
pointless... but you didn't have a choice in the matter anyways.
