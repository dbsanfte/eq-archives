Snip

Actually I think they do, but they did not fully think it through when
nerfing some "city" mob xp (as far as how this would also nerf the
heck out of quests.)

I've heard other players mentioning this lately, on various board (the
zem affecting quests) At first they thought that SOE had nerfed many
"newb xp level up quests" like CB belts, then they figured out what
really was happening.

I think SOE only did this because some players were standing around
right at the spawn point of those bitty rats and easily killing them
not stop (since they spawn right away) I experimented trying this with
a level one naked (with newb weapon) halfling warrior and easily made
level 2 at the rat spawn point (before this recent nerf)

So the quest thing might be something they alter.
