There's still some things in this game that annoy me.. Inventory
management, heroic opportunities, and pretty much the whole tradeskill
system.  However, the good things about EQ2 are really starting to
grow on me I think.

My summoner is now almost level 13 and just as I was about to dispair
about the lack of Adept I books, I finally got tellurian recruit adept
I as a drop last night!! Once I reach level 14 I get the summon heal
spell and then I can start soloing blue group double-up arrow versions
of a few certain mobs that drop books pretty regularly.

Does anyone know what I need to do to set up my personal store? I'd
like to start selling all these adept I books ASAP, since the chat
channels are filled with confused level 10-14 mages who desperately
need to upgrade their spells :)

I'm probably a n00b compared to those of you able to play more than a
couple hours a day like myself... I am seeing plenty of lvl20+ people
running around already, but it seems like 75% of the people I see in
town are lower than or roughly equal level to myself.
