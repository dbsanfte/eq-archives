The guy a couple posts back that I first responded to wasn't, no.  But the 
subject did come up in the last post, and that's what I was responding to 
here.

Yeah, no shit.  You think I've not heard that crap at least once a week 
for the last freaking year?  I'd think my first response was enough to 
state that such jokes on the ease of the Ragebringer are neither original 
nor witty.  It's a dead horse, and it's not as obscenely easy as people 
like to make it out to be.  Does it involve as many rare drops?  No.  But 
the entry rate of Rogue epics HAS slowed somewhat now that the back log of 
banked Kedge robes azre getting used up.  

Still, that doesn't mean that the rogues who get it don't work hard for 
it, or that their time and effort needs to be joked about.

As is the monk, but also almost as useful as the RB.
