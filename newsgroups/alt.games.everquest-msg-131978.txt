We can't directly observe the lepton.  We infer its presence from the way 
the instrument reacts to it, and can infer things about it from exactly 
how the instrument reacts.  If we already assume that the Creator 
created the universe, then the universe itself is said Deityscope, which, 
as you have observed, it a bit hard to "point". :) But we can make 
inferences about the creator from the nature of the universe he created.  
If that universe is vast and complex, it is not terribly far-fetched to 
assume that the creator is similarly vast and complex.

Unless, of course, the creator creates like a chaotic system, and is 
actually a very simple thing capable of promulgating complex behaviour.

That idea seems a bit at odds with this book He dictated, though.
