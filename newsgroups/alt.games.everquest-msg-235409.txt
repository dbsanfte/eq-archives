Not really.

Whos talking shit about another country??

The issue is empathy to someone who prevented utilizing the service he
is paying for (same as you) for a week out a month... not a "couple
damn hours every few weeks".

Since you ask, tyranny of the majority is one of the failures of pure
democracy, actually. It manifests when the collective self-interest or
even  indifference of a majority supercedes equitable treatment of a
minority.

It occurs in both the US and Canada manifesting as disproporianate
government attention to specific regions. 

 Equitably, one would expect a proportional amount of government
attention to be based on per capita numbers by region. The reality
however is that the les populous regions not only get less attention,
they get less attention *per capita*. This occurs because the
*majority* of people live in the populous regions and most don't give
two shits what goes on elsewhere... so say 95% of government attention
is attributed to just 60% of the population. The populous regions
should get *more* attention, but not virtually all of it... but
because they form the majority the rest of the country has no voice.

Don't be ignorant. In Canada for example the forerunning proposal for
senate reform is a second elected body, where candidates are selected
by regional boundary instead of population boundaries. This, primarily
to give a voice to the vast rural regions that have none, thanks to
'majority rule'.

Surely you can't possibly think that simple democracy is sufficient.
Democracy by itself would virtually gaurantee regular atrocities; if
the government wants to perform ghastly experiments on people with
some rare genetic disorder you can't rely on the majority to say no.
The majority don't have the disorder, aren't at risk for it, and
aren't affected by it... you'd be amazed at how complacent the
majority of people can be when it isn't them. It takes a constitution
or charter that specifically gaurantees individuals rights to prevent
an event like that. Democratic  "Majority rule" is perpetually on the
brink of becoming "tyranny of the majority" held in check by other
systems and constructs to protect minorities from a self-interested /
uncaring majority.
