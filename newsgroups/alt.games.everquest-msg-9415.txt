Lesson in logic for you (and anyone else who uses this phrase);

If you don't care at all, then it is impossible to care any less than
you already do.

If you care a great deal, it is possible to care less.

Ergo "I could really care less" = "I care"
and "I couldn't really care less" = "I don't care"

To state otherwise demonstrates appalling low logic/intelligence.

Then why do you have no-archive switched on?

Oh I won't be jacking off. I've already scanned thru several dozen of
them... and gleaned enough information to establish a pretty good
picture of your usenet career. I needed a bath afterwards... yours is
a sick sick mind, old man.

I claimed no such thing. The occasion you are alluding to involved  an
anglican minister, not a priest. I also wasn't afraid. Re-post it if
you still have a copy. Let's test the veracity of your claim.
