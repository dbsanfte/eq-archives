Which, if you weren't such an ignorant clod, you'd realize is not the case.

See my original post in the earlier thread.  You CAN login without an error
message but the login screen just pops back up as if you never tried.  No
warning, no error, if you enter a bad pass or name, you get an error; ergo,
my irritation that SOE didn't spend the spark of brainpower required to
simply check to see if cookies are enabled.  If you have a station account,
and then somebody visits another site with the sony.com domain and blocks
that domain for cookies, even if you have station.sony.com enabled with
'allows allow', it fails SILENTLY.
