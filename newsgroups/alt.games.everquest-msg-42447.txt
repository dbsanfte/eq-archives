This apparently does not apply to Arabs.

At least on the West Bank, where they give their children molotov
cocktails and stones to throw at Israeli policemen and soldiers.

What kind of parent allows his child to do that?

In fact, they even *train* how to do it. Here's a quote and source for 
that:

" Then, angry youngsters threw stones at Israeli troops armed with
automatic
weapons in a one-sided struggle that pushed the Palestinian question back
into the world's headlines. 

"It will be a different kind of Intifada. Not only will we use stones, but
weapons too," Soboh said. 

At the start of the two-month course, Soboh and other boys, some as young
as 10, learned how to handle AK-47 automatic rifles, fight with knives and
throw makeshift fire-bombs. 

Chanting "Long-live Palestine, let Israel die," some of the boys crawled
on their bellies under a wire fence which had been set on fire, while an
instructor live rounds into the dust. 

The boys learned how to disarm Israeli soldiers and practised capturing a
Jewish settlement. 

The "settlement," a wooden hut with an Israeli flag flying over it, was
conquered when some of the boys threw Molotov cocktails while others
attacked from the rear. "
