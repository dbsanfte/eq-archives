That Jitter is actually a fuction of EQ, your monitor, and video card.

Say you normally play in Full screen mode at 1240x1024. Your monitor refresh
rate will be something like 85 Hz

Sit down and open the book? Well that changes your resolution to 640x480,
and kicks your refresh rate up to 110Hz. That signal change from the Video
card to monitor causes your screen to jitter when ever you swtich modes.

The only fix is to use same res for all modes, which makes your spell book
about the size of a postage stamp. :-\
