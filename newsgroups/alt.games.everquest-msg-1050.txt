Not all flames are trolls. I'd say your definition is too narrow if
Bizbee's flames become defined as trolling.

A troll will post often massive amounts of nonsense, flames,
unwarranted personal attacks at any opportunity, false information and
obviously moronic questions and statements, for the sole purpose of
drawing attention (Often flames, or attempts at setting the troll
straight)

Bizbee does not do that.
