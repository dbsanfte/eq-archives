I don't know what server you're on, but Sol A is usually downright empty on
the few servers I've seen. On Povar, you might see 1 group in there - maybe
2 on a good day. It's a positively wonderful place for your mid to high 20's
if you bring your own group, but you'll never find a pick up there anymore
on any EQ server that I've seen. Too bad too - the xp in the early twenties
is second only to Paludal, and it would be nice to see some peeps spread
out.

I actually wish that SOE would adjust the ZEM more often to attempt to
balance out the load in different zones. There is absolutely no reason for
just a few zones to be perpetually overcamped. In theory, the ZEM was placed
much higher in the Luclin zones to try and get people to want to go there
(and therefore need to buy Luclin). I'm sure that's the reason the XP is so
phenomenal in the planes too. That said, most everyone who's going to buy
Luclin has it now, so why not dial SolA and a few other zones into a ZEM
range that's comparible to Luclin and spread the load out some.
