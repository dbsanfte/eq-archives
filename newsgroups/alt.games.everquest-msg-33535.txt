Druids and wizards are the only class to get two seperate lines of
roots (well, actually shamans/clerics get something similar but it
caps much lower).

The two lines of roots are:

1.  Slow cast, park the mob for a long time, fragile as hell when you
nuke the piss outta the mob.

2.  Fast casting, hold for a shorter time, relatively less fragile
against nukes.

Check the cast times of druid/wizard roots.  There should be one
series which casts in 1.8 seconds and another that casts in something
close to 2.5 seconds.

The latter is for root parking, the former is to root/nuke the
critter.

At level 56, both druids and wizards get a root that combines the best
of both:  Fast casting, long lasting, holds through a decent amount of
nuking.
