We've got a high elf smith, so I can probably put him to work on that (since
Precia follows Tunare).  I've stuck with them as long as I have because of
the wis.  A paladin's mana bar doesn't last very long as it is, and with all
of our heals having an abysmal efficiency, I've got to make the most of it.
Of course, I also need AC, since those plaguebone theifs are hitting for
80hp a pop.

Picked up a spider fur.  Can't sell the Direwolf, though, it's nodrop.

Oops, make that _Engraved_ Royal Velium Field Plate.

Not dooing too bad on weight, so I may look into CS or Kylong.

I have a FBSS that's sitting on my bard right now.  I was hurting for AC, so
I picked this up instead.

I'm mostly soloing, so I don't get the phat lewtz that come with hunting in
Karnors... of course, I don't have to deal with the baka-tachi that inhabit
KC, either.

Not a bad idea, there.  I'm simply doing it to improve my RoS faction, of
course, nothing more.
