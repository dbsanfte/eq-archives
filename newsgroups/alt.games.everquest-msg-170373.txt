Possibly the end of EQ.  As soon as it is possible to use
multitasking to hack EQ you can bet someone will.  While it's
been possible for a while using a different PC, most people with
that kind of knowledge and resources understand how easy it is to
destroy a game -- and there's not really that many of them
anyway.

It won't be long before the first "application" that destroys the
integrity of the game comes along.
