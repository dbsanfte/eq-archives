You do the combine in an INT caster because verant was SO kind as to make us
druids even more dependant on other classes now to get our items. Of course,
the only ones you need this for are Everlasting Breath and Levitation, not
exactly the most important spells in a druid's repertoire since you get
Enduring Breath and Levitate early on, and later there is Flight of Eagles,
and plenty of easy to get clicky and permanent EB items.

The LoY spells are quested in LoY zones, except for the Stonebrunt ports
which are available from the Shady Swashbuckler in Eastern Commonlands. You
know, the market zone Verant supplanted by making automated trading
available only if you buy their Luclin expansion, but screwed up royally by
creating huge lag by not addressing the line of sight issues that were not a
problem with the twisty EC tunnel. At least you don't have to fight for your
life in the lag of the Bazaar though, unless you actually like going into
the arena in the laggiest zone in EQ.
