I've been using the kick, wild swing, taunt HO chain the entire time from 
level 3 up as a solo and it has saved my neck on several occasions 
(especially when I get stupid and choose to fight group mobs alone).   I 
recently added thrust kick to the mix (either kick can be used in the same 
spot in the chain for variety - just don't try to use them back to back). 
So far I've only died once (against one of said group-flagged mobs) and even 
then the HO combos got me pretty close to winning that battle as landing 
just one more hit would likely have decided the fight in my favor.

That said, at the low levels my alternate mage can solo yellow cons that my 
fighter (now brawler) would have trembled at, even with the HO combos.

In group combat, however, I've yet to get a single HO off.  At least 1/4 of 
the time it's popped up there has been more than one icon on the wheel.  I 
think it would have to work in clockwise order, but I've just never been 
able to yet get with a team willing to work together to figure the crazy 
thing out.  The last team I joined was a complete fiasco.  I pointed out a 
mob, said let's go for that.  I taunted it, the battle began and then 
someone either did an AOE that grabbed two additional, otherwise non-aggro, 
mob groups or somehow mis-targeted.  Not sure which, but yikes!  When my HO 
action would come up first, someone would always do something to cancel it. 
And when I'd try to take the aggro back from the healer, she would heal 
someone and get the aggro again.  Barely survived that after losing our 
healer and not one HO went off though several were initiated.

Chalk up another experience to show why I generally prefer solo.  ;)  Though 
fortunately that was the only fight in which we lost complete control and 
lost a party member, we never did get that crazy combat wheel figured out in 
the group.
