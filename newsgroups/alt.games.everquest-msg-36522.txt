Well this weekend I got my epic !  Yahoo !

Well now i get this question from people from time to time.  What does a
High Priest with an epic do now in EQ?

EQ is like many of those games that you play and you beat them but you get
the chance to continue and play on.  Gotta love those games so you can do
all the things you never got a chance to do.  Many people usually quit after
making 60th or even getting their epic.  Well for me there are many quests i
still want to look into and 3 zones i haven't been to yet (PoM, Sleepers and
VP)  Then by the time i get to those I'll have SOL to go too and explore
with my guild and take down everything in our path.

The game is still fun after 60 and epic, and i'd rather be playing this
character than start another or play an old one cause it's just a lot of fun
still to me.

What is your thoughts?  Would you still be playing the character you are
with now after 60th or after you get your epic?
