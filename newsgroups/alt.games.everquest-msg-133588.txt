Easy. (And be prepared for a follow-up cadre of flames from people who
"don't like being told what to do", i.e. "people who are too lazy to
follow normal Usenet protocol and try to make the group more readable
for everyone else.")

Don't post in HTML

Don't post binaries (pictures, etc.) inside your posts. Use links to
them for others to follow as needed.

Don't top post.

Snip irrelavent text where appropriate and interlace responses as
needed.

Stay relatively on topic or label the thread appropriately as being O.T.
(Off Topic.  e.g. "O.T. The New D&D Movie!" or "O.T. My Dog's
Pregnant!")

Don't get bothered by the endless flamewars between the usual list of
suspects and visting trolls/stalkers of some of the regulars. You'll
recognize them fast enough. If not interested, just mark the thread
"read" and "ignore thread" and move on.

Pretty basic usenet stuff. Just makes it nicer for everyone.

Welcome aboard and good luck in the game. If you pick Xev and have any
questions, etc. give me a yell in game. I'm usually playing Jakiss.  God
only knows what zone I'd be in at any given time.

If seriously bored, and in need of a good laugh, feel free to take a
look at my pitiful wizard gear.
