This seems like an appropriate thread to ask this in:

I ported a friend to WL last night, he had found out he wasn't KOS to
dragons anymore and wanted to look around. He didn't think Wuoshi was
up, so we ported in. I haven't conned any CoV mobs, but am only warmly
to Coldain so I presumed I was probably still KOS.
We zone in, and before the 'You have entered Wakening Lands' message,
I see an OOC that Wuoshi is up. My friend says Wuoshi is up, he can
tell since he's looking at the dragon right behind the ring. My mind
goes Eep!, I hit gate and get away.

Now, the question is: does the fact that he didn't attack me during
those 6 seconds I spent in WL mean I'm not KOS anymore?
