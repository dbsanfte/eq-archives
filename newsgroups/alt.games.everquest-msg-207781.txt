apart from the obvious sources, anyone know were i can go to get help with
this combonation to work ? it worked once and the performance diff was
amazing, since then eq crashes at it's licensing agreement screen, every
time. i've had to revert to my old version of Catalyst 3.2 and things work
again but i'm back to the old performance.

with my old setup i would get about 1 frame per second while wondering
through the bazaar while facing straight forward.
with the newer dirver, when it worked the one time, i got an easy 5 frames
per second or more, what a diff, whooot.

please advise ;-)
