The only port to Kunark is to Dreadlands. Running through there could
be a tad hairy at 35, though. Invis, SOW, and pray. From DL, go to
Fronteir Mts, then OT. Your other option would be to hop the boat to
Firiona Vie, then LOIO to FM to OT.

The safest route would probably be, of course, to hop the boat from
Oasis to TD to OT.
