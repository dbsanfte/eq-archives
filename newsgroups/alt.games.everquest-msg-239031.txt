They say they fixed the issue of pet haste -

Pets with only spell haste on were not being hasted, but
they were getting the full effects of the spell haste and
item haste if given a muzzle of mardu.

Of course, this was a known issue on Test prior to March
10th, they just pushed it live without fixing it.
