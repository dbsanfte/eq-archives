6. You may not disrupt the normal playability of a zone or area.

Zone/Area Disruption is defined as any activity designed to harm or
inconvenience a number of groups rather than a specific player or group of
players. This includes, but is not limited to::

o Monopolizing most or all of the kills in an area.

o Deliberately blocking a doorway or narrow area so other players cannot get
past.

o Refusing to cooperate with the other parties at a contested spawn site
after having been instructed to do so by an EQCSR.

o Making excessive and inappropriate use of public channels of
communications (/shout, /ooc, etc.).

o Intentionally causing excessive zone latency (creating excessive corpses,
abusing spell effects, etc.).

o Causing intentional experience loss to other players (deliberately
impeding fleeing players by blocking their escape route, intentionally
training NPCs on other players, etc.).
