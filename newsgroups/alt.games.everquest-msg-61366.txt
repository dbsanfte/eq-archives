No it isn't.

Assuming the class you play HAS mana, yes, you got that right.

Also true, which is distinctly different than DAoC...nothing changes about
PvE in DAoC, except the numbers get bigger. In EQ, higher levels means
different tactics, different experiences.

If your regens were static as you claim, which they are not. Also assuming
that player skillsets remain the same, which they do not. Also unlike DAoC,
I might add...basically ever class in DAoC has every ability (and piece of
equipment) they will EVER get by level 15, everything else is just an
improved version. There is stuff to look forward to in EQ.

You still mez the same blue mobs that look exactly the same (granted, EQ
tends to recycle frog, bat, and spider models a bit much)., and hit for
proportionately the same amount.
