Yesterday I was at a vendor just browsing.  I've managed to save up 75pp
that I could blow (I had another 100pp saved for smithing) on some new
equipment.  I clicked on a couple of things, the last being a fine steel
scimitar for 60pp.  After deciding there was nothing I really wanted I tried
to exit the vendor dialog screen by pressing Purchase instead of Done.  I
now own a weapon that is incredibly less useful than my current weapon, cost
60pp and can be sold for about 5pp.  I sat, camped and cried.

At first I looked for someone around me to blame.  The wife was having none
of that but she did offer to give me 30pp to reduce the pain.  I declined
but it was appreciated.  I thought, "Damn, they should have a confirm for
buying stuff!".  Then I thought, no, that would normally drive me nuts and
if there was a way to turn it off, it would have been turned off.  So I
decided, completely irrationally, to blame Verant.  I was nerfed!  They
could have solved this just by mandating IQ tests before every play session.
While I'm normally fairly intelligent, I'm also fairly sure something was
temporarily out of service.

Damn them!

Lewis

P.S. /auction WTT FS Scimitar and 15pp for something better than a FS
Scimitar and 15pp.
