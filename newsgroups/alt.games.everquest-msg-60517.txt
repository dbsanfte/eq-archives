There has been a HUGE problem with USB cable modems if you have one of
those.  Do a google search using the words "cable modem" "USB" and
"incompatible" and you will probably turn up a lot.
As far as USB ethernet cards I've only seen one person using that, and that
was set up for him by the ISP personnel.  He is in the same town as me on
the same cable ISP and his connection is horrible.  I checked through all
his settings and they all seem correct to me, but everytime I use him system
it basically blows goat.  He might as well have phone.  The only thing I can
pick out is the USB nic.  Maybe soon I will replace his with one of my extra
PCI nics and do a test.
Enough ranting.  I hope a sentence or two helped you.
