Hello,

I think it's been this way for quite a few months now, but pet shrink for
Vah Shir beastlords ( and I think Barbarians and Ogres too ) only allows one
level of shrink and that level of shrink is not very high. You get something
on par with your pet size at 49 or slightly higher. So if you are at that
level or lower you will no longer see any difference.

It did at one point work I believe for more levels of shrink and to a
smaller size so that's why you are probably seeing the difference if it's
been a rather long time since you last used it. I get a lot of people asking
me to shrink my pet at 62 when it's shrunk already and the only thing I can
really suggest is to /bug it.

The beastlord forums have a thread on this one which might be more
informative as well as keep you up to date with progress on getting the
enormous unshrinkable pet of doom ( tm ) fixed :)

Hope that helps you!
