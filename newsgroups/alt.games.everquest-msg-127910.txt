Same applies to MapX.

It doesn't do anything to the game.  You have to type /loc and wait for MapX
to draw the littleX to see where you are.

Here's a question for you.  If I use Notepad to load up my log file I can
see what my skill level is, numerically, even though if I'm below 100 in a
given skill the game gives me no way to see that (it actually hides it).

Could I be banned for doing this?  I'm using Notepad to access the log file
and determine information I can't get in the game.

Obviously I don't think so.  By modifying the software they're talking about
something like Xylobot which draws the map right on the EQ screen.. Or
something like ShowEQ which really is showing you stuff you can't see any
other way.  Your location isn't a secret..

Guess we're going to just disagree on this one.. it's clear to me it's legal
and it's clear to you it's not.  :)
