Seems to me you're jumping to the wrong conclusion.  I'm
perfectly fine with them being /anon.  Why wouldn't I be?
They can play however they want.  That doesn't mean I
*have* to give them a rez, however, regardless of *my*
reasons.  Are you of the opinion every cleric that isn't /anon
is at the beck and call of anyone who asks for something?
Sounds like you're the one insisting other people play
according to the way you want them to...
