Personally I like the memory management better with XP. I don't run any 
DOS anymore really (and I could probably get it working in XP if I 
really tried) so I'll stay with XP.

I know AMD is less expensive but a bit more on the headache side. (4in1 
need I say more?). But really it's not THAT much more of a headache. 
Sorry but Intel is pricing themselves out of the market in my opinion.

Save it and go with one of the new DDR Intel boards. Intel knows it, I 
know it and probably even Rambus knows that they're a dying breed. I 
like the speed but again they're pricing themselves out of the market.

As I said above, look for a DDR motherboard. You'll have more options 
down the road (upgrading) and it'll save you some bucks. If you've got 
money to burn by all means stick with RDRAM.

Personal preference would be Nvidia for overall performance or ATI for 
visual quality. You're probably better off getting the Nvidia in my 
opinion.

> 6.Sound card:Sound blaster gamer(cant remember the correct name)
I'm preferential to Turtle Beach myself. Sound Blaster is starting to be 
the ATI of soundcards. Too many driver/no driver problems.

Nice choice.

> 
> 8.Dvd drive:I think one of the combo Dvd/cdrw drives(plextor maybe)
If you have the means (and by the sound of your choices you do) I'd go 
with a DVD/Ram drive. Why write 650MB when you can have over 1GB (or 
more?).

> 
> 9.Nic card: Are they all the same?(i currently have a 3com)
I'd generally go with a brand name. I prefer Intel, but as you said 
they're pretty much all the same. (Unless you run a corporate LAN)
