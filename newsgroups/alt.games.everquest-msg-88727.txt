You have *really* been playing too much when you sign off in real life 
with things like "Be well!" and "Safe travels!". Even worse, when you 
actually say that to people face to face. =/

I've come to think of a particular manager that doesn't come around to 
the workplace very often as a "rare spawn", and coming down to the 
entrance five minutes before the sandwich delivery van shows up as 
"camping it". =)
