I liked it because:
-It's easy to get to (you can port and TL there)
-The zone is large; there are plenty of camps and enough mobs to keep all 
of them busy
-Easy to find a pickup group
-Money is decent
-Melees can bind in one zone away (in FV), so you don't have a long CR if 
you die and can't find a rez

The only downside is that bitch Gorenaire...
