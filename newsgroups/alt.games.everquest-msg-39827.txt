For some OS's and graphic cards it works fine with no tricks as long
as you have screen same res in EQ OFF (so its really switching to full
screen 640 x 480 when going to inventory or F1 view) Then you just
have your regular res at anything other than 640 x 480. You can then
alt tab fine, and hit the minimized EQ thing on taskbar and get back
in fine, no hitches. This works fine for me in win98 with a tnt 16 meg
agp card, nvidia official newest drivers (12.41) Basically it works
like it was made to do so and Verant is not trying to prevent it at
all.. I find that odd it works so well.

Ctrl ESC worked well for me.. before recently I have no problem for
some obscure reason.
