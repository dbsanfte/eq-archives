I ordered the GoD upgrade early and have been getting all the downloads.
Tuesday night, I was fishing in Natimbi.
This morning, the Magus from Naderia pops me to a Jagged Pines zone entry
instead of Natimbi.
I look, and behold, I am not licensed to GoD.
Anyone else loose access? and how do I get it back?
