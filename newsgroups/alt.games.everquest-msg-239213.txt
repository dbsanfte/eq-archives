Myself, I haven't been able to play this week thanks to their patch
schedule and my life schedule... well once I got to log in and see the
'Patch Imminent Message'... and managed to get a few forage attempts
off before it time to log.

It is stupid, but its the way it is. Send feedback in game; the one
thing the people here are right about is that it doesn't make much
difference here. (Of course, at least google records it here... i have
a feelign /feedback goes into the /recycling bin for the amount of
attention they pay to player base needs.

And if your looking for sympathy you won't get it ... some people here
have never experienced 80% downtime in a month and just don't get it.

Myself, I think the pet haste bug could have waited a day or two...
since they were patching again anyways. They could have published the
workaround and just left it for the next important patch, but no...
