Since you don't want to go to OT, I suggest you.... go to OT.  But, not to 
hunt mobs, instead to hunt good players.  Get in a few groups and while you 
are sitting on your butt, chat about going somewhere else that will be more 
fun and not just a grind.  Mention Dalnir and Kaesora as possibilities.

After you get the attention of 4-5 good players who enjoy playing the game 
as something besides an EXP grind, go with them to the aforementioned 
dungeons ( Dalnir first, then Kaesora ) and explore, kill, loot, joke, and 
have a friggin' blast.
