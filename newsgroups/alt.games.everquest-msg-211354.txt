Let me phrase it this way for my point of view on the matter:
Government shouldn't legislate "victimless" crimes. Passing a law for
no other reason than the simple fact that it's "moral" is wrong, IMO.
If what I'm doing harms no one, if I'm not infringing on their rights,
stealing/damaging their property, or physically hurting them, then the
government should stay the hell out of it.
