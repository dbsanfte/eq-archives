It's more entertaining, though, when something takes out most of the party
but spares the rest.  We got to the bottom of The Hole, and attacked the guy
down there that is part of the Warrior epic, without any preparation.  (We
were in The Hole for other things, which we'd finished, which is why no one
had prepared for this guy).

We engage him, he drops to about 98% health...then he's at 100%, and the
tank is dead.  Then everyone else who had engaged him quickly dropped dead.
Only myself (Wizard) and the Cleric were not harmed.  We were still
indifferent to the mob, just like everyone else had been a few minutes
before.  It was way too early for me to nuke, and everyone was dead before
the Cleric could get a heal off, so we didn't have any aggro.

Turns out the mob has some ridiculous lifetap...something like 2000 points.
It's not clear from what I've read since then on that guy how often his
lifetap is supposed to proc, but if it is random, we got very unlucky,
because it went off on pretty much every attack.
