I've been happily working my solo bard tricks in the WL entrance
area inside Skyshrine for the past couple levels.  I use TBoots
to stay a step ahead of the mobs while doing a combination of
charm/swarm work, some charm kiting, and chant kiting.  The
entrance area now has new mobs in it, a four spawn, and there's a
two spawn along with a non-aggro vendor where Whisperwing used to
be, plus a three spawn in the room just outside there, and a
wanderer, every one of them blue to me and generally pullable in
pairs with a little care.

I fight them in the entrance hall just outside the gate, where
there's sufficient room to run laps while kiting or resticking
charm as needed.  This involves a little dip into the ramp down
to the gate, and occaisionally I'll get stuck there for a second
or so, long enough to let the mobs catch me and take a few free
swings at my back, and worse sometimes to stun me and really take
a good couple rounds.

So I hit 45, and suddenly my SS Boots start working.  I'm
excited, this will mean I can soar over the drop each time, no
more getting stuck.  As I may have as many as three angry golems
on my furry tail, a round of getting hit means a full bubble of
health, stunned and hit a couple more rounds means three
bubbles.. I've even died on that silly lip once or twice!

Well I start in with a straight charm, and the target mob gets a
bit lucky before my pet pulls him off.  Charm breaks, and again I
get beat up more than usual... just luck though, I've been beat
up before.  By the time the target is dead and I'm looking at my
pet break charm, though, its time to run for zone.. and I get
beat up on that trip too!

At this point its still nothing I haven't seen before though, and
I'm thinking its a classic case of the "just leveled up and the
RNG is going to mess with me" syndrome.

Well the RNG keeps beating me up good, I have to zone out a
couple more times.  I do kill a mob each time, and now I'm down
to one left of the four spawn.  Well naturally I come in and pull
him to chant him down.  But he's beating on me.  Continously.
Every time I take a lap I'm down another quarter bubble.  Finally
I'm forced to zone.

Well I'm pig headed, I try it again, first looking to make sure
Run is on, my encumberance is under my str, my Tboots are
freshened up, my Aria is on...

Run out of the zone again.

And again (did I mention I'm pig headed?)

I'm wracking my brains trying to figure out whats different; I'm
not using a new song, I'm on the same exact mobs I've killed a
hundred times over for most of two levels.. the only thing thats
changed is I've leveled up!

Then it hits me... I'm using the SS boots Aria of Eagles.  I
click that off and suddenly the mob isn't hitting me as I circle
anymore.  I did two more yellow in that same spot, same
techniques, just as easy as it ever was.

I'm still not sure that I'm actually slower with the Aria on.
Maybe its something to do with pathing there in that one spot;
when I dip down into the ramp that might make the mobs path
differently, and soaring overhead perhaps makes them take a
shortcut.

I went to SkyFire, and found that I could certainly run my
modified rectangle around the mobs there all I want... of course
there, there's ROOM to do so!

So there you have it, a little riddle for you.

Am I slower flying, or what?
