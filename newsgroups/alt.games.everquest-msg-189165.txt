Shame on her for not rezzing you.  Add her entire guild to your "no rez" list. 
Seriously.  If the officers behave this way you for darn sure don't want to be
around them.
I've never had a problem finding out the leader of a guild:  /who all guild
"Emerald stars".  Then I send a /tell to a high level that is NOT in an area
where he's likely to be busy, (any city or low level area, but not the bazaar).
   And I most certainly let the leader know, usually in a polite e-mail.  Who
wants jerks in their guild?
You are a cleric.  They will need you long before you need them again.  Their
behavior will get them punishment enough in the future.
