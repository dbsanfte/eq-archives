This is from my UI_Lizsolo_rodcet.ini file.  Cut and paste into your
appropriate character .ini file and you'll get a Skills window.  To be
clear, replace what you have in your file with this:

[SkillsWindow]

YPos1152x864=392
Width=300
Height=240
BGTint.red=255
BGTint.green=255
BGTint.blue=255
Fades=true
Delay=2000
Duration=500
Alpha=255
FadeToAlpha=255
Locked=false
XPos1024x768=262
YPos1024x768=181
XPos1280x768=376
YPos1280x768=392
XPos1280x1024=376
