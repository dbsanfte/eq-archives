I have to admit I didn't start canning much until I got Chloro.  Certainly,
at 54, I use it all the time with Regrowth and Cann III.  It's not insane
mana regen by any means, but it lets me get off one more heal in an
emergency, of drop one more DoT or nuke on a mob I'm soloing.  When I use my
pet for soloing, I find that I end up using a lot of mana keeping it alive,
more than I use to just kill the mob myself.  Maybe it's the mobs I'm taking
on.
