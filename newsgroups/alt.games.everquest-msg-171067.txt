Hmm... nope, don't see nothin there about "a law".  In retrospect, I think I
was presenting the idea more along the lines of "since there are so many
Buddhists in America, why don't we let them start the school day with
*their* prayers."  See, that wouldn't entail a law.  That would be a matter
of allowing our friendly neighborhood Buddhists (who we love so much, even
though they're heathens who are all going to hell, because we wouldn't want
to be prejudiced, oh no!) to have full representation in our schools.  And
of course, since many Americans can't afford private schools, there will be
a lot of non-Buddhists sitting through those prayers -- but that's ok!  The
Buddhists have to sit through Christian prayers (if those "religious types
with a cantankerous streak" have their way, that is), so it's only fair that
*your* kids sit through their prayers.  Maybe your kids will even *like* the
Buddhist prayers and become enlightened Buddhists, and then it won't be so
hard sitting through Buddhist prayers, they'll just be able to pray right
along with them!  Maybe we could even make a religion called
Buddhochristianity, combining the best of the two religions, so that
Christians and Buddhists can pray together!  That would be even better!
Right?  No?  Well, I have to say, Sanji, it's hardly fair for you to expect
Buddhists to sit through your prayers and you not sit through theirs.  So, I
think what I'll do tomorrow, first thing, is get together all the religious
parents in my local school district, and suggest the following program at
the beginning of every school day, starting with kindergarten all the way up
through high school:

First thing when the kids are in their seats:  A nice refreshing Muslim
prayer to Allah, all kneeling and facing the city of Mecca (We'll pass the
Qu'ran around here so that all the kids will understand all about Allah and
his faithful, the Islam).  Then we'll have our Mormon prayers (instead of
Qu'ran it'll be the Book of Mormon this time -- so on through the rest of
the prayers).  Hindus come next, complete with altars and incense.  The
incense will come in handy because we can simply reuse it for the next
prayer, the Buddhist one.  And last but certainly not least, as the smell of
sweet incense carrying Hindu and Buddhist prayers up to their respective
gods fills the classroom, we'll all kneel and pray to Jesus about how much
he loves us all... we'll be sure to throw in some Catholic prayers,
Protestant prayers, probably the Lord's Prayer (that one's pretty
universal), and then one last, loud, glorious free-for-all
weeping-and-wringing-hands prayer session (all religions welcome to join in
with their respecive prayers, feel free to mingle and learn everyone else's
religion, kids, it'll help destroy the demon of prejudice that's always
haunted us).

And just to show you're in complete agreement with the spirit of the whole
thing, why don't you do the same for your school district, and then we can
come back here to the newsgroup and share our successes (surely not
failures, since every enlightened person will agree with this program).
Hell, why doesn't EVERYBODY join in!  Everyone on this newsgroup, take the
above program and present it to your local school district.  If there's a
religion in your town who's not represented, add them!  We just might start
a whole new era of tolerance and peaceful co-existence from this one
newsgroup!

Unfortunately, Sanjian, your religion is not the only one in existence, and
other parents feel jsut as strongly as you do about their kids being raised
in what they consider the "right" religion.  So I really think that the best
arrangement is that you practice privately and with others who believe as
you do, and other religious people practice equally privately.  Lo and
behold!  This is exactly the arrangement we have today!  So... why don't
your "religious types with a cantankerous streak" stick their thumbs where
the sun don't shine and quit trying to shove their religion down everyone
else's throat.  How's that for equal representation?

~!JDK!~
