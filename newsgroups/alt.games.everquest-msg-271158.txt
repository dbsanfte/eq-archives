Play EverQuest 1, it's mature, fun and does not have these problems. I 
doubt I'll spend any serious time in or evaluating either game for my 
playtime for 6 months or more while they work out all thier problems. 
They'll probably settle down and be much more reliable further down the 
road. The adventurers are always the ones with the arrows in their 
backs, you know?

And if for some reason you do decide to give EQ a shot, try Stromm 
server. I cannot speak for the others (although Morden Rasp is probably 
decent too) but I know on Stromm there is a diverse player population 
with plenty of people to group with at all levels pretty much 24/7. It 
does get a little quiet in the overnight hours EST say from 1 AM to 8 AM 
but even then I always manage to put together groups when I want them. 
The trick is, don't just sit there LFG, do something about it. Use the 
LFG tool and recruit members for your own group and off you go. It's 
amazing how many people are too lazy to do this and will sit around 
complaining about how long they sit LFG. I often find people are very 
glad to get an invite too when you ask them.

It sounds to me like both companies shipped code that still should have 
been considered beta. But that's just my take. Although all the outtages 
do tend support that conclusion.

Try a mature game like EverQuest and you won't be unable to play all the 
time. And really, I think EverQuest is a great game myself. I've only 
been playing for a year and I only have brought one character up to the 
60's so far but it's been a great ride for me and I've really enjoyed 
it. And given it's age, maybe that's why it rarely goes down for 
anything but scheduled maintainance they post well in advance on the 
official Website. And God, the world of Norrath is HUGE with so many 
places to see and things to do. And while not cutting edge by any means 
it looks pretty good I think.

I found EQ really took some time to sink my teeth into and a long time 
to learn about because it has so much depth. But I always have thought 
of that as being something I liked very much about it. Maybe it's 
because I've only been playing a year that I don't have the sometimes 
jaded view of longtime players who've been in the game for several years 
or more. As for me though, I still want to bring up at least several 
more classes to high levels as each one plays so differently it's almost 
like a new game again. I just started a druid and after 65 levels of 
playing a cleric he is so much fun and so different.

If EQ isn't your cup of tea, how about checking out the free Anarchy 
Online trial. I have not heard any horror stories about them but instead 
have been hearing good things from those who play the game. See the 
thread in this forum for the impressions of some EQ players trying it 
out if you have not already. Maybe you'd like it too. It wouldn't cost 
you a dime to find out. You may recall that Funcom who makes this game 
still holds the grand prize for worst launch in MMORPG history as far as 
I know. But all reports indicate a good game has come of it in the end.

There's also DAoC to consider, especially if the idea of pvp or rvr 
conflict appeals to you. It must be quite interesting to take on the 
most interesting opponents of all, other players. I'd like to try that 
game out myself sometime. And perhaps I will before I ever want to try 
EQ2 and WoW.

You're right. Neither of those games was ready for primetime with the 
problems they have been having, it is obvious. But for a lot of us, I 
think it was also expected. I never had any faith in either of them 
pulling off a flawless launch with no problems.

And don't laugh anyone but there's also Asheron's Call that you might 
want to look into. It's old and small but it has its fans and with 
Turbine taking it back from MS and developing an expansion expected in 
the Spring, it may have some more life in it yet. I played it when it 
was new and thought it was a lot of fun. I might have played it a lot 
longer but my daughters took over my PC and account they liked it so 
much. In fact, because of that I got them each their own PCs that year 
and setup our first home network, got a second AC account so they could 
play together and off they went. They played for a long time and really 
enjoyed it. I think it's only 10 bucks to buy the software and download 
it from the Turbine Website nowadays and that includes the Dark Majesty 
expansion as well. Of course, the graphics are a little behind the times 
but the art direction and use of color was great as I recall and I 
remember it looking quite good. Another thing in its favor is their 
world is something unique and not much at all like the standard D&D fare 
that is basically what one sees in EQ, EQ2, DAoC, etc. I don't know as 
much about WoW as far as this goes.

So my advice, which I am following myself, is to stick to established 
titles for now and avoid the irritation while these games stabilize and 
improve in their first year.
