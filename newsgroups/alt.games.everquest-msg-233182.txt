And this has what, exactly, to do with creating a shortage?

Funny, plenty of people stayed in the market during (once again)
rationing in WW2...

Where are your sources for WW2 rationing causing a lower overall

News flash: Price control and rationing aren't the same thing.

Nevermind that, upon seeing the light out, he should have been more
careful to start with and treated the intersection like a 4-way stop
sign, but with even more care than a normal 4-way stop. The traffic
light going out didn't turn the other vehicles invisible...

Nevermind all the blind people who can easily navigate stairs
successfully (and the sighted people who can do so with their eyes
shut). I never will understand what makes navigating a staircase you
know is there harder just because the lights go out. I've done it many
times with no trouble at all... And before you go mentioning age
factors, my 80 year old grandmother with a walker can even navigate
stairs in the dark with no problem.

Nevermind the less greasy options that are readily available even
eating out for breakfast. Hell, a lot of diners out there even have
cereal and oatmeal on their menus. Nobody forced him to go to
McDonald's... Besides, 1 week's worth of greasy breakfasts doesn't
create the hardened arteries that lead to heart failure. Even 1 week's
worth of 3 meals a day. It takes years to develop to that point.
