First off,  to all the high level SK's out there working on thier
epics ----- Dont Shoot Me!

Secondly, here is the situation.   I recently went on my first Plane
raid, happened to be to Hate and it went super smooth.  While in the
room where most apparently pull Maestro to, we dropped a few Ashenbone
Drakes (very cool looking beasts) and the first one dropped a
"Decrepit Hide".  Noone wanted it or knew what it was for and some
were even saying it was just "junk loot".  Now I dont know about you
but if you have to go all the way to a God's home and it is tagged
Magic-Lore and No Drop I have a hard time believing it is just junk
although there surely are examples.  So with less than a minute on the
Rot timer I asked for objections, none given I looted it.

Well later on I find out a  member of the raid was told by a guildy
that it was for the SK epic and hard to get.  I talked to the guildy
and told him if I could I would MQ it for him.

So the question is... does anyone know if it CAN be?  He has the Drake
spine from Rhazar and the Enchanted Plat.

I am a 47 Warrior born in FP that is worse than worse with the Militia
there, and the underground dont like me none either.  I dont think the
guy they go to in QA will be a problem as I havent done anything to
Truespirit to my knowlege.  Any thoughts?
