It's faster to run the Misty Thicket route than the alternative
through Highhold.  No, it's not logical but it is true.  It's
very easy to test -- just run once from the EK bridge one way
and once from the WC/Kith zone the other.   The Misty Thicket
route is substantially faster, at least if you don't zone
VERY slowly.  It's not, however, as good a choice if you're
KoS to halflings and don't have Invis.
