Another consideration on prices is they tend to vary between servers.
Sometimes the varience can be rather large - Stein of Moggok about a
year and a half ago sold on Tunare for 250pp. On Luclin, it sold for
75-100pp. And there's the other matter: Time causes prices to
fluctuate. Blue diamonds once sold for over 2kpp each on Tunare.
Before the last tradeskill upgrade, they were selling for maybe 700p.
I'm not sure right now if the tradeskill upgrade gave that a boost,
but I think it's safe to assume it did. Iron Oxide is another example.
Used to be junk loot except for armor dye. People sold it off to
merchants all the time. Now people pay up to 400p for it. No, that's
not per stack, that's per single oxide.
