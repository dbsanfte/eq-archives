Isn't the corpse unrezzable after three realtime hours? I mean, that
sounds like a really kickass idea that's got me chuckling already, but
you'd have to time it pretty carefully for the corpse to be rezzable,
yes? But I can also see how it could be a way to totally ubertwink a
brand new character. This would work with the same server character
transfers, wouldn't it? I mean, if I started a new account and paid the
fifty bucks to move my warrior to it on a different server, couldn't I
use the corpse trick to put all of my gear and armor onto a new, similar
class character of the same name back on my old account?

Damn you. You've got me thinking evil thoughts again. I wonder how many
levels a first level warrior would get out of a 90% rez off a level 51
corspe? Not to mention being totally twinked out to obscene levels.
Exploit? Already nerfed to not be possible? If the live character has
been moved to a new server, but a corpse by that name remains on the
server, would the name filter allow it to pass? If not, then that's a
whole lot of gear left to rot. I guess the safest route is still to give
all the no drop stuff to an alt/friend to bank, and just take your
chances on the no-drop stuff.
