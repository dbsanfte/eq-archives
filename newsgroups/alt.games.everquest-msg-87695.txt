First of all, what class are you? If you can cast spells that can heal, why not
start healing the mobs he's fighting?

I heard a story once about a Cleric who was sick of a particular jerk (a
Warrior or Monk, I think) constantly KSing mobs from him. He started following
the jerk around and healing anything the moron attacked. The KSer finally got
the point and left him alone.

Failing that, how about buffing anything he fights? ;)

If you're not a caster, I have no idea what you could do, unless you know a
caster willing to help you out.
