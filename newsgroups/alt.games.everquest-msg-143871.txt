Aye, and for those who take oaths seriously:
-- that oath is to defend the constitution against "<all> enemies,
foreign and <domestic>" (emphasis added), and
-- the orders that you swear to obey are specificly qualified as
"lawful orders", and
-- I do not recall being released from that oath when I left the
service (nor did I wish to be).
