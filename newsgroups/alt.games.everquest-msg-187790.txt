Lots of good feedback, I dont mind the critisism, I knew i would get
some by posting my little stories--of course, I did'nt bother putting
in all the details and background for reasons of leangth and clarity,
so I will make just a few general points as some appear to have
concluded that the 2nd story represents how i always play, which is
not the case

1-this was the first time i never rezzed a groupmate-ever!-I've played
with others that were jerks, but still rezzed them, but the last week,
it seemed I was meeting more than my quota
 ---and as an example of how i usually play-the day before, 2 in our
party die in KC basement(nice, regular party), and I stayed with them
for 2 hours(not 'playing', just waiting) to rez them as getting the
bods was a nightmare, and complicated by about 4 frickin huge trains
during that time
2-I did NOT abandon my party in a dangerous area-I told them i was
going to leave at end of fight, I waited till the fight was over,
healed everyone, there was a clear road to ent and they were close to
it, ...then i gated, 
3-the main reason i didnt leave after we reformed after the wipeout,
was a chanter I really like playing with joined, and i figured, what
the hell, its worth staying to play with her (so to speak;)
4-the final straw for my temper was his fucking yipping and yapping
while we were fighting for our lives-asking for the rez, what % it was
ect.-3 others in group had to tell him to wait, be patient we're
frickin fighting...
 anyway-the above are a few points that might be usefull for
considering

So, based on all the feedback, I have discerened the following points

1-the vast majority think my 'story 1' was appropriate
2-the vast majority feel in story 2-the rogues behaviour was totally
unaceptable 
3-a majority feel the rogue got what he deserved BUT, that I should
not have done what I did -for the groups sake, my reputations sake,
ect
4-it seems almost 50-50 as to whether a clr is 'obligated' to rez a
group member-personally, I lean towards 'its my job', so i do it-but
being a major league dick-wadd can bring about exceptions (please
see'pissing off the cleric' rule)
5-My biggest mistake was  in either not giving ultimatum about not
accepting thief back (remember he bailed on us, when we still had a cr
to deal with), or just choosing to leave, without getting into
arguement
6-a  minority feel strongly that the thiefs( and others like him)
behaviour deserves some real consiquences to try to curb it-the gms
dont seem to, and without unpleasent consiquences, negative behaviour
will continue-he bailed on us, so I bailed on him-WHY did group leader
let him back in :(

Conclusion-if it happened again-I would do 1 of 2 things, in order of
preference
1) -leave group when it reformed as i dont want to play with that guy
anymore
2)-rez the jerk, and then tell the rest I'm leaving cause I'm tired of
playing with that guy

To all that responded, thanks alot-many made very good points-some i
had not considered-thanks for the feedback
