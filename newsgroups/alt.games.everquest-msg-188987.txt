Are you only huntng as a Duo? or are you guys grouping ?

If your happy to group find your self a willing meat shield (War, Pal, SK at
a push Rng Brd) and run on down to echo caverns.

The Needlites should be easy kills in a group, just make sure you DS the
tank and the little critters will almost kill themselfs.
Boglings are also good but you might find the re-pop time a little slow with
3 people.

You could also try the spires outside Paw in South Karana, you might even be
able to get away with just rooting and nuking so wouldnt need a tank.
Aviaks in SK are good too, but I would get a tank for this, nice money and
drop items worth a few pp to vendors too.

Alot of people head over to Marus seru at this level and join a group, but I
find it boring hunting still you should find a group easy enough.

Frontier mountians (sp?) can be rather good over at the Giant fort and you
have a chance at getting a yummy forest loop too.

Um thats about all I can think of right now, but I really cant think of a
single place you could Duo with ease thats a odd combination.
