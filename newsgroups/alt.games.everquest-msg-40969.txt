Wow, and you think that puts EQ's system to shame?  Sounds horrible to
me.  PvP should allow combat between folks of differing levels without a
predetermined outcome of the higher level winning.  Anything else is
pure crap, no skill, no tactics, just a bigger number so they win.  Same
for PvE, but especially in terms of PvP combat since higher levels love
to pick on lower levels( well the gimpy ones anyway).  Not much about AO
is worth tooting a horn about but in PvP there I have been attacked by
someone several levels above me and was in the process of stomping him
before his buddies showed up.  That is more what PvP should be about,
just because you are higher level doesn't mean its safe to attack lower
levels, they may fight back!
