Wolf form give your SoW and lasts as long as you are in the zone.  So you do
not need to keep reapplying SoW and it won't fade at a bad time.

Charm animals allows you to have a short duration pet that can do some
serious damage (griffenes, anyone?), when the charm breaks, just be far
enough away to recharm or kill it because it's now at low health.  Always
remember to snare whatever you are planning on chaming, first.

Sunbeam works like fear.  Can be very useful while soloing.

And, especially when faction hunting, Tremor can be real useful.  Just be
real careful of aggroing many mobs at once.  PBAoE spells do have their
uses.

Agreed on the rest.  If you decide to hunt in SolA, resist fire can be
useful, though.
