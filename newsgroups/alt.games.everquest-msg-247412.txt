Well it's one thing to be good at business cases and models and it's a whole
'nother to be good at designing a game. I think it's pretty rare that the
two go hand in hand. So I see it as entirely possible that the company could
do a crappy job of designing a game while at the same time doing a damned
good job of marketing what's left. In fact, SWG is a perfect historical
example of this and it's the same company!
