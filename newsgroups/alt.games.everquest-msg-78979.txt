  Nah, you can get into the 3rd Gate without being an
Innoruuk-worshipping dark elf.  My erudite shadow knight of
Cazic-Thule was welcomed there (albeit dubiously).  I gave a bunch of
red wine to a guy in the library and now the 3rd Gate guard considers
me amiably (and most of the town's merchants are warm to me).  I doubt
I'd be welcomed in the necromancer/shadow knight guild though.
