Re-read it yourself, idiot.  Tell me how this is not cheating (mob ac / hp /
items / placement).

Get a goddamn clue before posting shit like this, cheats like this may not
directly (although they can) effect my own play, like say, aimbots in
counterstrike do, they are derroagatory (spl) to the game as a whole,
completley undermines some class abilities (hello tracking!), and
generally, makes it less of a game as a whole.

It is a cheat, you would have to be a complete ignorant assmonkey not to see
this.

As I said before:

Keep ya fucking hacks to yourself, newbie.

Ya, I hate cheaters in online games, in case you could not gather this :)
