Well, if we're talking personal opinions, then allow me to say that, 
IMO, people who have a problem with those who use the term, "gtg" in the 
course of normal play, should remove whatever foreign object from their 
rectum that is causing such discomfort.

Do you also have a problem with those who use contractions when they 
type? How about just shortened versions of terms such as, "port" 
(instead of teleport)? Do you look down upon those who say, "PoK"? 

Picture a scenario where everyone on your friends list suddenly realized 
that every time they have mentioned getting "KEI" or "Temp" you viewed 
them as lazy, then tell me how you really feel about it.
