I was reading an interview with one of the Verant guys, who said that
Luclin, with its new engine, could be considered EQ 1.5.

Personally, I can't see what a version number has to do with anything.
As long as it's the game I enjoy most, I'll keep playing it, and they
can number it whatever they want.
