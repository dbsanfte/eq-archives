Chris,
A soloist who can group is a wonderful thing.  The problem is that far, far
too many soloists can't group.

You mention that groups tend to want haste, heal/manasong, lull, and mezz.
You know what?  The fact that you even KNOW that puts you head and shoulders
above some of the solobards I've tried to group with on 40s and 50s toons.
I've met bards who didn't know what the level 8 song was FOR; the same one
didn't know what song to use to mezz mobs.  I grouped with another one who
didn't know the duration of his mezz song, he thought it was good for 40
seconds like an enchanter mezz.  I was in a group in Chardok with a bard
along to haste and DS, it didn't happen - he had his drum out, he was
chanting the mobs down (a perfectly valid tactic, unless you're the only
source of haste for a melee-heavy group!).

From reading your post, you sound like you know what you're doing.  My
problem is that far too many don't have a clue.
