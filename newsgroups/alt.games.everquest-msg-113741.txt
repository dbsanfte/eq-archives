Actually, there's little or no comparison between the two.  If I'm
rebuilding a transmission, I'm working, whether it's for an employer, or for
my car; that requires attention to detail (actually, I don't work in the
automotive industry, the gears and couplings I work on are in a power
plant).  When I'm replying to newsgroups, I have no intention on being
anywhere near as locked on as I am on watch.

You can't be at top form all the time.  I save that level of attention and
professionalism for where it truely matters.  a.g.e. just doesn't fit the
mold of "what truely matters."
