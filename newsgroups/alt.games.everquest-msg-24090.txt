Well, before I found out about the clerics of Mischief along the
Kithicor Entry, I was hoping to be able to use it to get vegetables
(RE: The berries, veggies, fruit post) but since I'm KOS to them and
seemingly all the quests involved with raising enough halfling faction
involve reducing faction with my kinsmen, I guess the only thing to do
is go on a rampage killing most of the halflings in Nek forest :).

Oh well, I guess I can prolly get my friend to ferry veggies for my
vodka habit.

Thanks for all the info,

Gwinaxath, Shadow Knight
