Being a developer myself, I can understand the problems which arise in
attempting to code this. For example, say you want to make 9 silk
threads. You put in 18 spiderling silks and hit COMBINE.  Now, EQ has
to determine if you wanted 9 silk threads (2 silks required for each)
or 6 silk cords (3 silks required for each).

Not to mention the fact that the nature of computer-generated random
numbers may give you and extreme advantage if you could perform these
mass combines multiple times within a typical 6-second game tick.

I don't need it spoon-fed to me. I just wish there were a little less
risk involved for committing such a simple/common error.
