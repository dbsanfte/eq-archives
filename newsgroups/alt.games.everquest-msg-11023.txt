You are very brave at level 16.

Go with fury (and LOTS of help) to the lost temple of Cazic-Thule.  Slay the
Tae En Templar in the Temple of Cazic-Thule for a "Lizardscale Cloak." (his
common drop)

Then take the three parts to the rune of scale, and the lizardscale cloak to
the wizard union rep in the temple of Solusek Ro, and she will give you the
"Runescale Cloak." a fine, Wizard Only, NO DROP, +int back item.

FYI: The portion of the Temple of Cazic-Thule that you have to go to is
pretty much suicide for you.  Also, the Croc in Lavastorm is about level 30
(IIRC)... but then, the saltwater crocs in Guk are (reported to be) 27-29.
