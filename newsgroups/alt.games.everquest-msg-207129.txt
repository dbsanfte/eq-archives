We don't know the full story, I was going on my impression from what we 
were told.  The impression I got was that there was not a good reason 
offered for the AFK, and, if that indeed was the case, that would most 
certianly, in my mind, explain why he was not awarded the subsequent 
drop.  Perhaps the OP will post more details, and we can make a better 
informed decision, until then, we can only go by what we have been told, 
and our best guesses.
