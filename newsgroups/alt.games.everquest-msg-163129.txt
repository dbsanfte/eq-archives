Umm? Naggy/vox are for most people the first raids in their careers, not 
the last.. So yes, keep collecting that gear. A set of 
diamond/bluediamond gear is where most people start off when working on 
a good set of resist gear as it has all resists spread quite evenly. 
Still, those pieces with just a single or maybe 2 resists do come in 
handy often too.
