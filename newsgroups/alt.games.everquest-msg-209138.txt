Hey Will,
Two of my RL buddies quit EQ nearly a year ago.
They had the exact same gripes with the direction of the game.
They have tried several MMORPGS inc AC2, EVE, and a few other obscure games
but they are currently playing Anarchy Online and they LOVE it. They have
been playing for nearly 6 months now and they are very happy with the game
play.

I am currently still playing EQ and my char finally reached 53 after 3
years. (Rangers level slow when we spend most of our time LFG)
