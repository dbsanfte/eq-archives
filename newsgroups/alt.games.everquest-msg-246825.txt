A thousand monkeys banging on keyboards posted the following under the

VT gear is no longer necessary really and will become less so after
the next expansion.

VP is about to get easier to enter. Well actually harder in terms of
encounters but far less time expended.

The only requirements to get into tier 2 and 3 are L55 and L62
respectively, excluding tactics and sol ro. There's no real need to
change any of that and I will be uberpissed if they remove the flag
requirements on tier 4 (elementals), pissed enough to quit EQ
permanently.

For all of these, as well wish for the sun to rise in the west
tomorrow. None of them will ever even be considered, whether they are
good ideas or not.
