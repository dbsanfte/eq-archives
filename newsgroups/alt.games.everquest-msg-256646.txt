Grouped with a GoDless druid last night, and he could see the messages 
as well.

I can't confirm that, though, its possible he had GoD without knowing 
it, as I think it was a kid on his father's account.

To use a leadership ability, you must be leader.  This is a bit of a 
pain, as in order to get leadership points you must also be leader; I 
end up grouping with people who are working on LP's, and if I'm -not- 
then it seems a waste to not let them have leader (if I am then its 
still a quandry, but one we can resolve with random or something), 
however when I'm not leader we miss out on the Delegate Main Assist and 
the Spell Awareness!

You also need to have at least three people in your group, but they 
don't need to be in exp range or even in the same zone.

This leads me to a question; can three people who are going to solo in 
different zones group up in order to gain the Leadership abilities one 
of them has?

Many of the Leadership abilities are fairly worthless in most groups; 
things like hp regen, when you normally have a healer.  Solo, though, 
every point of hp regen I can scrape together counts!  Delegate Main 
Assist would be worthles, but Spell Awareness would be nicer as there's 
only me doing interrupts, instead of several people such that the mob 
never gets a spell off anyway.
