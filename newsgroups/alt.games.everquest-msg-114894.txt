I *think* you were asking for a place to train them all at once.  There 
really isn't such a place

Lockpick - train in Befallen, any of the locked doors.  But be aware that 
the first door requires skill 11.  If you trained it at 6, you'll have to 
put 5 more points in before being able to open it, and that's the lowest 
one in the game.  You can practice lock pick on any locked door, as long 
as you can open it, all the way up to 210 (max=5*Level+5 up to level 39, 
from level 51 you get 2 points per level up to 210 at 55).

Disarm Traps - sit in front of the swinging axe of doom at the beginning 
of Sol a and click on it.  Shouldn't take bu maybe an hour and a half to 
max the skill to 200 at level 39.

Sense Traps - any zone, just keep pressing the button.  like sense 
heading.

You build them by using them, same as any thing in EQ.  To make poisons, 
you combine ingredients in a mortar and pestle to make a poison, to apply 
right click your weapon on the poison bottle.  There are some good recipe 
sites on the internet, just go do a search on Everquest and poison and you 
are bound to find them.

Why?  Because it simply isn't offered there.  Go back to one of the 
antonica/faydwer guilds.
