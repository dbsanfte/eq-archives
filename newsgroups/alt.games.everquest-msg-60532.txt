Not true. The stat enhancing gear only affects your attributes when it is
worn. For example, a warrior who knows he will be dinging after the next
gear puts on some gear to increase his stamina. Yes, he will see a larger
than usual jump in his hitpoints. However, as soon as he takes off that
gear, down go his hitpoints back to where they would normally be. Of course,
as a warrior, he would probably be wearing this gear most of the time
anyway, unless it sacrificed too much AC.

So don't worry about those twinks running around with great gear. At least
not in consideration to the question in your post. That gear does not
permanently increase hp/mana/resistances when they level. Of course, it
might help them level faster....
