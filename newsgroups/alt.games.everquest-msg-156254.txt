In the intro to Maps of Myrist it briefly mentions that Maelin had talked to
the oracle in oot and was sent to seek the Fallen.  Seems like a quest, but
I couldn't get anything out of the oracle.  Anyone know anything more about
this quest, or is it just window dressing for the book?  Has anyone heard of
the Fallen?
