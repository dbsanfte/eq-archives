It sucks, I've heard horror stories about how long it takes to do some of 
the camps.  Best advice I can offer is take some time to work on it when 
you can, and expect it to take you a lot of calendar time to finish it.  
If you want to try to complete it quickly, then you will be in for some 
potentially horribly long camps waiting on a rare spawn.

What I have usually done on those types of spawns, is bind nearby, and 
check in periodically.  I have done several of the Veeshan's Peak key 
parts that way, and the burning priest for the shield of bane warding as 
well, eventually, I got lucky and the mob I needed was up.

The reason it is so highly desirable for a cleric to have the epic is 
that it can make the difference between a successful regroup after a wipe 
or partial wipe on a raid, and a complete failure.  It makes for an 
extremely fast recovery from a wipe.
