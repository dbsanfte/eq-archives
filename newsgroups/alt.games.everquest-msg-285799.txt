Your old characters will be just as you left them assuming you can
remember your login, password and server.  You can use the discs to
install the game as many times as you want it's the registration code
you can only use once (which she'll need to use to create her new
account).

Remember though  you'll be missing a lot of expansions so will
probably want to buy another copy of Titanium to bring your account up
to speed to match hers.
