The 'Lore of the World' needs to at the very least acknowledge zones for 
them to be covered by the suspension of disbeleif. It doesn't. For you 
to accept them you have to rationize them completely on your own.

EQ acknowledges that magic elves exist, they are in the story... I've 
yet to see an in game story where the troll shaman were pursuing the 
invading froklok heroes, but the frogloks crossed that invisible but 
impervious boundary between West Karanas and North Karanas...

e.g. those boundaries, are very significant, splicing human cities into 
segments, and providing the means to escape nearly every threat any 
where in the game, ensures Negafen will never pursue adventurers into 
Lavastorm or Freeport... 

You'd think if these barriers really 'existed' in the story of the 
world, they'd have come up in the lore from time to time.

Indeed.
