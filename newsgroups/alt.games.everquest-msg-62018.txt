There are 3 shaman only producible gate potions, Potion of Frost, Potion of
Swamp, and Potion of Bones.  They tp you to, Everfrost, Innothule Swamp, and
Field of Bones respectively.  They cost 187p8g each to attempt to make,
trivial at 170.  There are various potions and/or items that can be quested
for to gate to other places.  Thurgadin, OT Outpost (I think), Rivervale(not
everyone can get or use it I think), Cazic Thule.  Probably are others as
well.
