string based group song.

I ran this while running around in NL a bit just before logging
out last night.  Worked without a strings instrument equipped at
all, like Hymn (and unlike soothing)

questions: A) does a string instrument help at all?  if so, what
part.
B) wow.
C) hope I don't have to use a string instrument.
D) equally, hope this is baseline with no instrument, and an
instrument makes it even better
E) did I mention wow?
F) been a Looooooooong time since an upgrade to these lines,
hasn't it?
G) If I run this full time, isnt it the equivalent of KEI... and
stacks with KEI?  And I can sing pulse mana too?
H) wow.
