Of course much of it sounds like DAoC.  Mythic got to see how EQ was going
when they designed DAoC, and fix many of Verant's mistakes.  E.g., the way
items have levels and slowly decay addresses the problems of excessive
twinking without getting rid of the good aspects of twinking, and helps the
game economy...both areas where EQ has problems.

Just as Mythic learned from Verant, Verant gets to learn from Mythic in EQ2.

Someday, if there is a DAoC2, Mythic in turn will learn again from what
Verant does in EQ2.

It will be interesting to see how Verant handles uberloot in EQ2.  The
system Mythic is using in the Darkness Falls dungeon is very interesting,
and seems to address many of the things that make high-level EQ dungeons
very annoying.
