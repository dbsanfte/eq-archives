You have to remember that, while it is theoretically possible to hunt
in IC below 30, people are rarely going to choose you for a pickup
group there unless you are a cleric or there's no one else and they're
filling slots. You'd be much better off if you BYOG.

Thirty people in KC could be LM, RM, LCY, RCY, and Hands. That still
leaves sewers and captain just off the top of my head. Before VL
became the big pickup zone, KC used to hold as many as 70-80 people,
which was definitely a strain. 30 (on Torv) would still be sort of a
slow night.
