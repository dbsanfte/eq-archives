I qoute from the spell's list:

Bonds of Force
A direct descendant of the Druids spell, 'Ensnare'.. this will slow your
enemy down to walking speed (reduces movement by 55%). Take note that this
is an Area Effect spell and can grasp up to 4 mobs in it's radius. Do not
cast in melee range for risk of rooting yourself. Also, if there is a couple
of mobs in the vicinity of where you cast and it hits them, you will be
added to thier aggro list.


Im pretty sure you are incorrect my friend.
