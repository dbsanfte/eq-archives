A man walks into a bar, and sees a horse behind the bar serving
drinks.  He sis down and just stares at this situation for a few
minutes. His mouth slightly ajaw.   The horse walks up to him and
says, "What'll ya have?"  The guy jus stares.  The horse finally says,
"wats the matter?  Never seen a horse serving bar before?"  The guy
says, "No.  ... I just can't believe the cow sold the place."
