Because in day to day xp grinds, most mages find themselves casting a
LOT more nukes than summoned pets.  Once you summon a pet in a group,
you often don't have to do so again for a very long time.  Most of the
good mage nukes (with some exceptions) are evocation.

There just aren't that many times a mage needs to cast fast
conjuration spell for lower mana compared to nukes, with the exception
of chain summoning pets.
