Ok so I have these friends who have been "pushing" EQ like drug dealers for
many months now. At long last I've decided to take my first shot, but much to
my suprise I've discovered that's it's nearly impossible to actually buy it!

Everywhere seems to be offering luclin, but not the triple pack. Looking
online I see that Game and EB are both out of stock and softwarefirst and
amazon now both completely deny the existance of any original EQ packs at
all.

So does anyone have any helpful suggestions?

James
