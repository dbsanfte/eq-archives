I tried this, but like another great solo spot, the Hole, the islands
seem to be permacamped on MT.  Worse, they require a long run to
check, the campers rarely respond to camp check, and once there I'm a
very long way from a way out, as a non gating class.   For a wizard or
druid this would be fine, raft in, succor most of the way there, and
gate or port out when done or if already taken.
