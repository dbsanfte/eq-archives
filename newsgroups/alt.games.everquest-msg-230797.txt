GV: Air.  Finally, a GV pet I don't have to ask about using.  GV fire, 
like V Fire, is a terrible pet that I never managed to find any 
situation for.  GV Earth, I did get to use a lot, happily a lot more 
people in high 50s groups are willing to change their melee style to 
accomodate a rooting pet; I always asked, and easily 90% of the time 
nobody objected to earth pet, heck, sometimes he was actually viewed as 
a positive, better as an off tank, helping stop runners in groups with 
no snarer.

But honestly, root sucks in most situations, and casting it repeatedly 
eats into pet DPS, which is what he's there for in most cases.

Air pet, on the other hand, does the same melee damage, works almost as 
well as an off tank (not as many HP, but better mitigation, and no root, 
but with stuns his taunt is similar to a paladin's, good at keeping his 
target from running off after the cleric who's healing the MT on the 
real target), and he stuns, which has been parsed out as equivalent to a 
20% slow if they are landing.

Malosini becomes a very good idea, because pet stuns are an important 
part of his utility.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Manastorm.  Rain spell.  Ick.  Resisted a -lot-.  More than regular 
rains, even.  This is because it also has a mana destroying component 
apparantly, although I can't find stats on how much mana, nor how 
effective it really is at stopping caster mobs from casting sooner.  The 
damage per mana ratio isn't bad on paper, but the incredible resist rate 
turns it into one of the worst ratio's I have, at least thus far 
(admittedly, going after mobs that con even to yellow...)

One question I have is how good the mana destroying part is, if its 
decent enough, I'll use it on the boss mob fights where the bards and 
enchanters are already going flat out trying to kill mob mana... except 
that as it does damage at the same time, I won't be able to do so on 
mezzed mobs like they can.

Or if its really good, I could use it on Chealing or Gating exp mobs, 
hopefully sucking them dry before they get down to where they'd start 
casting such nastiness.  Mobs tend to have deep pools though, so the 
effect would have to be pretty huge.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Seeking Flame of Seukor.  Fire based bolt spell, highest damage I have 
at this point (even at 60), decent mana ratio, but since I'm Conjuration 
based, not as impressive as it could be, and bolt spells, well, in 
addition to normal resists, you always have to consider the chance that 
someone or a pet is going to move into your LOS just as it goes off.  I 
did use it some, but mostly I stuck to the 57 Shock of Steel.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Valiant Companion.  Makes pet immune to Fear.  Of course, I hear all 61+ 
pets are immune to fear, which makes this of marginal usefulness.  And 
I've never had my pet feared, not in 60 levels, not once.  So we have a 
spell thats useful only in very limited rare circumstances, and only for 
levels 59 and 60.  Costs hundreds of pp off the spell vendor that has it 
(EC Tunnel).  Were the Dev's on a Green Day when they came up with this 
one?

Splendid One, already past 59 Gnomage, that was a blink and you'll miss 
it level!, Firiona Vie
