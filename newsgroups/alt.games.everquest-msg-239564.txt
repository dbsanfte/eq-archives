wow chuck, this really sucks.  you've got about eleven or twelve posts and
only one or two that really answer your question...anyway, languages are
important on the RP server because most people only start out with one or
maybe two languages mastered.  i find, however, that if you see someone who
is a race that speaks a language you do not know yet, they are usually
willing to help you out.  you can usually just talk to them in elvish to
start out, but if they don't speak that try sending a tell.  i forget if it
is ;tell or :tell, but i'm sure someone will post it later...anyway the
;tell/:tell works better than the /tell because they will understand you no
matter what language you speak.  for instance, i met a dwarf before i spoke
anything (except dark elvish) and we had to communicate with the ;tell for a
while until he taught me elvish.  hope that helps...
