I've done three pickup groups for LDoN, and three guild groups.  Had only 
one problem with one of the pickup groups, a druid got pissy and left in 
the middle, we completed it successfully anyway, and have only failed on 
guild groups so far.  Probably comes from being less picky about 
selecting who to do the adventure with, i.e. class and level.
