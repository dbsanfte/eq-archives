You are allowed to have up to 8 characters on each server, so the
simplest thing to do when you want to help a very low level friend who
is on the other side of the continent (or world) is to create a second
character of your own that starts near where your friend is.

You can either make something to compliment your friend's class (e.g.,
if your friend is a warrior, you could make a cleric), or make
something that is the same class as your friend, so that you can
directly understand and try to solve any problems your friend has.
