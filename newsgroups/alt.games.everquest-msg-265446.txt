Hmm, must be a local or district issue.   My local supervisor of elections 
website has among other things a Polling Location Finder.  You put in your 
address and it gives you your voting precinct location and a map.  The site 
also has sample ballots and other info.

One of the main reasons that alot of polling places are held inside churches 
is that they generally (1) have alot of parking, (2) are usually not being 
used on Tuesday, and (3) are located within or near neighborhoods that make 
up the voting precincts.
