I personally hope the let McVeigh off on all charges...

It would be just wonderful to start a betting pool to see how long he
actually lives after they release him and would definately be cool to learn
that he was murdered by some mob and hung by his nutsack in the town
square...

McVeigh doesn't derserve the compassion of being put to death
painlessly...he should be first tortured for months and everyone in America
should be allowed to kick his ass before they let him die...

IMHO

=oD
