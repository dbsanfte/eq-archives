	Bull-fucking-shit.

	Powergamers always have an advantage over casual gamers and *you can't
stop that*.  

|I think (and I've read every bit of information that the devs have mentioned
|anywhere regarding the Jedi process, so this is a very educated guess) that
|it will involve a random sequence of quests/missions, different for each
|character, and there will be extremely cryptic clues in-game that will tell
|you (if you're smart enough and can figure them out) what the next quest in
|the sequence is.

	That's really no different from what I suggested; Jedihood would be
effectively random.

|I'd also imagine that they'll periodically change the set
|of quests and the clues involved, so you can't simply build a database of
|quests and clues and check every single quest and look for one of the
|appropriate clues.

	Doubtful; too labor-intensive.

|This is true in that the devs have said that if you come up against a Jedi
|in 1-on-1 combat, run!  But you have to consider that (1) Jedi will be rare,
|so it won't be something you have to worry about too often,

	Rarity does not correct an imbalance.  You are also assuming that Jedi
will actually be as rare as the designers intend, which is not at all a given.
(It does not appear that the system for determining force sensitivity has
actually been tested....)

|(2) given the
|proper weapons/vehicles you might have a chance, 

	That doesn't change the tremendous effect a "power class" has on a game.
EQ is not a PvP game, so technically it doesn't matter that a Warrior has no
real chance against a Druid or Necromancer, but the overwhelming power of
those (and other) classes has shaped the game from the beginning.

|(3) SWG, unlike EQ, is
|not completely, or even mostly, geared towards combat.

	Of *course* it is.  They said the same thing about UO and it was false
there too.

|Combatant
|professions make up only a small percentage of total professions.  And
|whatever you might think -- there are entire guilds of 100+ members already
|in existence pending the release of SWG who are entirely composed of people
|who intend to be manufacturers, dancers, miners, traders, explorers, etc.,
|none of which are even slightly geared towards combat.

	*yaaaaawn*

	Impresses me as much as the folks who have had Shadowbane guilds for the
past year.  Talk is cheap; we'll see what actually happens when the game comes
out.  I flatly predict that the economic game will turn out to be as
interesting as watching paint dry.  I further predict that the "player run
economy" will crash and burn in a month or so, requiring massive retuning and
probably requiring that several factors that had been left to the players be
returned to NPCs or other forms of automation.

|Also there's the PvP system... while the system is set up to encourage
|combatants to engage in PvP you won't have to fight other players unless you
|want to.

	Koster has always said that rewards for PvP areas have to be better than
PvE rewards, because PvP is riskier.  Anything worth having is going to
require that you at least expose yourself to PvP for it, if not actually
engage in PvP.

|See above.  And the reason Jedi accounts won't be sold to any large degree
|is that it's supposed to be nearly as hard to remain a Jedi as it is to
|become one.

	Again, *supposed to be*.  These things are never as difficult as the
designers think they are.

|Ebayers might buy a Jedi but they'll stay Jedi for all of two
|days, since they'll know absolutely nothing about playing one.

	I expect Allakhazam's will have a guide for playing Jedi fairly soon after
the game goes live.

|Making Jedi accounts difficult to play won't necessarily prevent ebaying but
|it will certainly make sure that griefers won't buy them and then act like
|5-year-olds with a rattle.

	Are you putting me on?  The griefers will be the ones selling them.
