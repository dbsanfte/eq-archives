As others have pointed out, you can consent other characters as well as
yourself, whether currently online or off. I have the Guild CR Mule in
the Hole for our groups. We've taken our share of wipeouts there in the
past while learning our way around, and I have everyone (including yours
truly) consent my alt before I log off, then I start pulling. 

Likewise, when we run into other poor unfortunates there who need help
(providing I'm not that busy and willing to do so) I have them give
consent while my main is still on, and when I log on the mule, I'm all
ready to go. Works fine. At least until it get's nerfed someday because
it's not in "The Vision" (TM).
