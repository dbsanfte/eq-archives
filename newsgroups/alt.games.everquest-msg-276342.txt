   This type of idiotic response is a big part of why I'm taking a break 
from EQ for a while. It really seemed like the responses I got to a 
series of petitions over the course of three days were generated by some 
guy with a Magic 8 Ball, and there was no attempt to really read what 
I'd typed out and respond to the problem I was having.

  My corpse was MIA in Droga, necro couldn't summon it, and consenting 
wasn't generating the "you have given so-and-so...." message. I 
petitioned that I was either stuck under the world or my corpse had been 
eaten by goblins (hindsight says that attempting to be funny in a 
petition is a bad idea) and the response that I got 13 hours later was 
to try /rewind. Uh, I'm not stuck, I'm gone...so I responded that 
/rewind wasn't going to help me, as my character wasn't stuck, her 
corpse was missing. I explained again that my friendly neighborhood 
necro was unable to summon my corpse because it kept telling him that I 
didn't have a corpse in the zone, and that I was 100% sure that I'd died 
in that zone, I even knew the precise spot where I'd died, etc.

  I had to log out, so I halfway expected to have some sort of fix dealt 
out before I logged back in the next day, and I suppose there was, in a 
warped sort of way. I logged in to find myself in the middle of PoK, and 
the petition window informed me that the GM was sorry that I had gotten 
stuck, but he'd moved my character to a safe place in PoK and everything 
should be fine now. He went on to say that the next time I found myself 
stuck, I should try the /rewind command. *sigh* She was indeed in a safe 
place, and still naked, and there was still no sign of my corpse back in 
Droga.

   The next petition about my missing corpse and gear got me a response 
along the lines of "I am sorry, but I am unable to replace items that 
are lost through death. We apologize for the inconvenience this may 
cause, blah blah blah."

   Anyway, on day three I said "screw it", and haven't logged back in 
for a couple of weeks now. I figure that by the time I get the itch to 
play again, I *should* have a moldy corpse in Shadowrest. I hope so, 
anyway. I've not been wanting to play as much for a couple of months 
now, so this just gave me another nudge away from the game. =/
