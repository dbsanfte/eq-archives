this is probably the biggest danger for 20th and below levels and a real
pain, Gix.  Almost killed my enchanter when I was around 20th, zoned into
befallen barely in time.  Was like what the heck was that.  This guy is
definitely under-conned, at least when I dealt with him.  Lately when going
thru WC my enchanter mezzes and ignores, even if he gets smacked around a
little by this guy.  he isn't worth my faction to bother killing for no real
benefit (besides keeping people not looking out for him safe till he
respawns).  still gotta deal with DE's city for epic, and the less I ruin my
already ruined faction with them , the better.
