I'm not too sure if I understand what he means by "stupidity" and
"KFing", but just so you know, Ogmuk had moved the gateway down to the
bottom of the forum.  Possibly to attract a little less attention from
the more raging audience, but he didn't say anything about it so who
knows!

Personally, I really don't want to conflict and fight with anyone here,
but don't get me wrong - I, as you might have seen from other folks
from where I post from, don't allow people to order me to bend over for
them when they try to push me around.  No offense Bizbee.  -_-
