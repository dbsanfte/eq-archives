 This is correct. And it's camped 24/7 by Uber Guild members and when
and IF it drops they promptly sell it for 50kpp (on my server at least).
 
 Not worth the hassle if you ask me. This spell is pretty much reserverd
for the privelidged elite. Since I can gate to EC and/or Bazaar anytime
I like I'll just keep my bat wings well stocked.
 
 Sure would be nice if Sony made this a random drop off of a few other
MOBs throughout Luclin or elsewhere so it would be a BIT more available.
As it is, unless you are a member of a super guild, you'll never see it.
