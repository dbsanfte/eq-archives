Hi all,

I was just browsing around the web. Trying to find some EverQuest
Quest-Walk-Through's... Suddently i found this webpage:

http://www.geocities.com/hacker24m

I know i shouldnt have, but i did it anyway - tried it. And *GRRR* -
It works. I was running like a horse... There were a moneyhack as
well, but i couldnt make it work (may be out dated)...

Why do ppl. make those kinda' progz?

They should be killed for good...
