on a side note, isnt requiring a purchase to be made in order to enter to
win a prize illegal in the u.s. ?

im not sure if it falls under a gambling law or some type of fraud
prevention law or what but im fairly certain its illegal, all the same.


However, back on topic to this spam.. this is a bogus ad, the
tracking.ige.com url indicates its a 3rd party that will make some money
if you buy anything from ige, there may be no prize at all.

*if* you insist on buying from ige, always use www.ige.com and dont help
the asshole spammers make money.
