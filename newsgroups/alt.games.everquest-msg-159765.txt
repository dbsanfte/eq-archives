Head to the Warrens dungeon.

Great way to make exp and plat there. The kobolds drop bronze weapons
and wicker armor which sells pretty good.

Also if you turn in the molars from the kobolds to a paladin in
Erudin you can get some ring mail armor.

As you build up money, try and auction to buy some bronze or
banded armor. If you have the SoL expansion check the bazaar
some people sell some decent stuff cheap there.
