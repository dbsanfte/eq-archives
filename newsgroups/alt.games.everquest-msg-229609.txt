Stupid people do.  Long story short: 65 Druid, Epic, ton of Ssra/Vex
Thal etc stuff plus expensive droppables (borrowed Flowing Slime boots
for one) tries soloing in HoH and dies.

Doesn't organise a rez and then logs off... doesn't return for AGES
due to the vagaries of a late teens social life and is surprised when
corpse is nowhere to be found.

GMs sympathises but offer nothing but a "leg up" kit.  We were
unimpressed in general; the rightful owner of the 100k+ boots even
less so.
