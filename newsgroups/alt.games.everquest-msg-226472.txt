Not at all.

We're in the phase right now with Microsoft where its a consumer 
benefit. The next phase is: competition ceases to exist and Microsoft 
jacks the price into the stratoshphere for the same product, ceases to 
be innovative, cuts support back, and laughs all the way to the bank.

At that point you would say that people would just switch OSes, but to 
develop an OS to compete with Windows takes years to do and millions of 
dollars worth of effort. And as soon as it came out MS would either buy 
it with its ill gotten spoils, or just undercut them so hard that they 
go bankrupt before they get out of the gate.

That is why linux is such a thorn, and why they are active supporters of 
trying to render it 'unconstitutional', and any attempt to restrict its 
legality to playback DVDs, and any other 'drm' media for not being 
'trusted' in order to kill it.

What about Apple? Apple competes too, but is entirely in its own 
hardware playground sufficiently so that the two products are not nearly 
as substitutable as Linux and Windows are. Windows likes Apple 'being 
there' because its a good defence in anti-trust cases, but not a real 
threat to Windows like Linux is.

As a supporter of the free-market you should recognize that market 
failures *can* occur, and actively preventing them is the responsibility 
of government. Dumping, Tying, and Predatory Pricing are all beneficial 
in the short-term for the consumer but long term they will ruin the market.

There *must* be competition in a free market... practices that 
ultimately result in the competition being driven out of the market do 
not perpetrate a healthy market.
