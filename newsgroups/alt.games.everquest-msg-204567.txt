It won't 'overwrite' the haste effect, but any slow 'nullifies' all haste
effects (assuming it doesn't mitigate the slow).
That was the idea behind the when they tried nerfing charms on test by
adding a 1% slow component. Haste spells/items would no longer have an
effect, (unless of course charm broke... nassssty)

When, not if, When.

but ohhh that's a sweet-sweet thing. I want one! Or I'll take two, they are

I figure If it gets to swing at me I'm dead (can get about  2000 hp with
decent buffs, dual wielding lets it quad, and
I'm sure it won't miss me.)
