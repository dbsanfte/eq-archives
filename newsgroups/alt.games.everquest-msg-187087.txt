Care to elaborate?  I was already not pleased with what they choose to make
LoY-only.  Now I find out the new research stuff is also LoY only, for no
apparent good reason (it wasn't on the list of things they listed beforehand
as being part of LoY).

I was already getting kind of tired of EQ, so this pushes it over the top.

Other things that I've not been happy with:

1. Play is too repetitive.  It only takes one or two trips to a given area
in a dungeon to experience all the charm of that area.  Stand/wait for 50%/
nuke/med gets boring after a while.

2. SoL and PoP, with their high XP zones and powerful items, have made it
hard to get people together for days or weeks of camping in the old world or
Kunark.  This has caused some friction in my guild.  Some of us would like
to do our epics still--but most don't want to put in the time, and I can see
their point.  Who wants to sit in Kedge killing Phinny over and over to help
some Wizard get a staff, when that time can be spent getting an AA point
every 30 minutes in PoP?

I can see how it would be moronic if I had been perfectly happy with pre-LoY
EQ to say that the research thing is the last straw.  But that's not the
case.  It's more that LoY is confirming that Sony seems to be going in a
direction that is away from what I'd like, and so all the other things I
don't like are probably either not going to be addressed, or will be
addressed in expansions.
