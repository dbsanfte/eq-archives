Yeah, I'm wondering how they'll map out confusing zones like that :) Too 
bad, because that's the kind of map system I've always wanted, too.

Having advertised it to all classes as a new item?  Let them pray that 
they were not that foolish.  ::dark, necro-y look::

Oof.  Not another key, please.  I always fill all mine up. ><  How about 
a command?  /map, anyone?

> If it is skill-based, how will the progression work? 

Hee.  This would be fun, in a really sadistic way.  "You have read the 
map wrong.  You are not in West Freeport.  You are now standing in front 
of Trakanon.  Bye bye."  (anybody remember that sense heading joke from 
Bard's Log? ;p)

That would be decidedly useful, but perhaps too much like ShowEQ for 
them to like ;p  I sure would like it though.  "The poison supply 
merchant is on THIS end of PoK, the fletcher is over THERE, and here are 
the 3 billion people needed for the planar traveller's book, and..." on 
second thought, too many locs. ;p
