Anyone else see the EQ2 commercial that is running on G4TechTV?  It's been
shown during the last couple of episodes of "The Screen Savers".  The
graphics in the commercial are *way* better than anything I've seen in game.
Even if I set the game to the extreme setting (which, on my GF FX5900XT is
actually reasonably playable out in Antonica), it comes nowhere near
matching the graphics in the commercial.

So...is there a way to actually get those graphics in the game, or is the
commercial just misleading?
