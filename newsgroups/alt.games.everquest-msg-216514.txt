One of the failures on my record was Rujarkian Hills. We *couldn't*
zone in; the blue marker on my compass directed us to a point offset
from the actual entrance. We couldn't click on the dungeon entrance
to enter, and the marked entrance was in midair (I strafed around it,
it was just a patch of grass, up the hill a bit from the usual
entrance.)

Yes, the domain is sad, but effective. :-)
