Yes, its great dying on average, once per day from linkdeath (silly me, I
solo). I love my character with jboots, going in and getting torn apart by a
giant while i cant do squat. This isnt just my ISP either... we have
multiple people all going LD at once. Verant wont lift a finger either.

If this is enough to put people off buying the game, then so be it. Verant
has multiple ways to fix it. 2 obvious ones are auto feign death on LD... or
(I like this one better) auto run away to zone. Or it will be in the logs
that i got killed by a giant, *and* I have jboots, *and* the giant is blue
to me, *and* a bunch of other people also went LD at the same time... so
maybe just once they could believe me?

Id be cancelling EQ at this point, if it wernt for the fact that it cancels
my characters too. Maybe sometime down the track, some orpg manufactufer
will come up with the idea of "transferring" your characters from EQ
(starting you off with something very similar/similar items). I guess until
then Ill suck it up.
