Trying to balance my (Ranger) gear between stamina and dexterity, I'm
now to the point where unbuffed stamina is 210 or so while dexterity,
(sans special, otherwise-crappy dexterity gear,) is around 160.  Str
is easy to raise.  Wis/Int/Char are easy to raise.  Agility, well no
one seems to care about agility.  Dexterity is a little harder IMO.
