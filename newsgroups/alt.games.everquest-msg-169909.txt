But my gear wasn't trashy and I farmed a lot to be able to buy it... he's my
oldest character and he started soloing basically because he couldn't get
groups... people were always ignoring him in favour of the warrior with
lammy/wurmy etc and I had huge problems getting a split of the loot because
of wt restrictions. It wasn't until i could two box that i made my first K,
and it wasn't until the bazaar opened that I made about 50 K (100 possibly?)
and i learnt that tradeskills are a money pit and designed to cause wrist
injuries.

Does anyone ever make money out of them? Started on them originally to make
my own cured silk gear. I remember the guides saying you will make money
from banded, what a joke. I totally agree with
http://www.valendor.org/gumkak/showarticle.asp?article=1 and if eq 2
implements the ideas, I'll play it, otherwise I'll quit these games for a
decade or so.

As for the warrior who couldn't fight drolvargs, i see warriors fighting
caster mobs with much greater ease than I'll ever know. I assume warrior
gear has better resists generally, or perhaps there's a different resist
table for them?
