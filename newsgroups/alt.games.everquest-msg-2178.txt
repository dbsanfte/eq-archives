The same place that Gynok does -- right at the entrance to Befallen
(i.e. the same place that players appear when they first arrive
there after zoning in from WC).

I wish...  No, they don't.  Which PH (or Gynok) appears at any
given spawning is totally random (although Gynok is a lot
Rarer than the others).

Yup.

Nope.  Unless they changed it in the last few months when I was
camping Gynok a lot and studying his habits, he can take at least
26 hours to spawn (I sat on my butt the whole time waiting for him
before he arrived), or he can spawn twice in a row (personally seen
that too).

Right.  He usually drops the Platinum Ring.
