Hi,

My name is Elhea, Little wizzie erudite lvl 18 on antonius Bayle server.
Today, I would be lucky because I can log in EQ. But, 2 Week Ago, I was LD
in Paludal, and due to missing time, I couldn't log before today.And what is
my surprise when I arrived on Select character screen ! I was naked !!! :-(
I'll try to contact GM to explain this but they don't want to know anything
:-( I know that's a mistake not to go back after LD, but I'm newby in EQ,
and don't know corpse stay during a fixed time lootable ! After, corpse
disapear !

My question is this one : Anyone could tell me how to find a not bad
equipment for so few money ?

thx for advance

Elhea the unlucky wizzyGirl
