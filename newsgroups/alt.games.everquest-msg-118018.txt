Here's how I took out Lord Bergurgle solo:

Stun to pull, start swimming like mad up to land
Stun again when he arrives
Cast Hammer (channel part of this with  Lord beating on me)
Stun
Holy Might
Force
Stun
Holy Might
Force
etc.

I stayed right in melee range, and had melee turned
on, that combined with the stun aggro kept him on
me in the few instants when he managed to get anything
going thru the constant stun.  Stuns alone would -not- have
been near enough damage to kill him before running me
out of mana, and any other solution would have let him
cast his CHeals.  Hammer, though was a plenty good
substitute for a non tank melee, slamming in fast and
frequent damage on the poor constantly incapacitated
Lord B, I think I finished fight with 3 bubs of mana, and
thats cause I spent a bub on my pet!
