That's laughably ignorant. The USA is known for it's biased and controlled
news.

Heh, so did we. Funny how it wasn't till the bombing of Perl Habour that
your country decided to help them, after hundreds of thousands were already
dead. How very noble of you.

I don't see evidence of that. Perhaps you want to challenge him

The fact is, you are not the only country to suffer terrorism. One,
admittedly horrific, attack on the USA and they go beserk. Can you imagine
the UK cruise bombing Ireland? The whole world would be in uproar and
rightly so.
