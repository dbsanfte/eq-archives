The new zone, The Warrens sounds like a good place for you.  Lavastorm may
be ok.  SRo is too.  Heck, Najena near the front is probably good for you as
well.

Let's see, Blackburrow probably is.  Steamfont is kinda pushing it but you
can get another level or two out of it.  Once you both get up to 14 or so,
Dagnor's Cauldron is good (though low threshold for overcrowding...anything
more than 10 is too much for that zone but most people are just passing
through so a /who isn't a good indicator).
