Why? He likes the game. He just cannot find anyone to play it with on 
the server he's on. He wasn't complaining about EverQuest itself, simply 
that there is a sparse population on his server, at least in the level 
ranges he wishes to be with. Given that, the move to a server that 
solves the problem completely was excellent advice. Now if he was asking 
what game should I be looking at because I am tired of EQ and don't want 
to play it anymore, think it sucks, never liked it, etc., well then 
you'd be right.
