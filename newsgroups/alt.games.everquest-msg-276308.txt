It's not the point of the money. It's the end result that is the point. If
the companies open it up to selling things for real money then it will
validate the other thousand morons on the server who are camping for IGE.
Kill stealing and camping were bad enough in EQ where it was outlawed - I'd
hate to see what happens when it isn't.

Ok, I want to clarify something here. I'm against buying *any* items
(either ingame or out) with real money. It will trigger what I've mentioned
above. Now as to "game" money, yes, there will be those that will camp and
sell "game" items for ingame cash. That's the way it shall ever be. I can
live with that - they took the time ingame to camp the item, were skilled
enough to overcome those challenges and deserve to make an ingame profit.
What I can't abide is the person that camps the item, sells it then sells
the cash to IGE. That fuels the buyers of such ingame cash to go out and
buy even more stuff ingame perpetuating the cycle. The end result is that
it's bad for the game unless there is a way to draw off cash and items. EQ
shows this problem with it's mudflation. I can't blame the developers
necessarily - they're game designers not economists, but now knowing what
they know if they themselves start this cycle (without taking measures to
combat the cycle) then they're cutting their own throat.

Question: If you could live forever, would you and why? Answer: I would not
live forever, because we should not live forever, because if we were
supposed to live forever, then we would live forever, but we cannot live
forever, which is why I would not live forever.
