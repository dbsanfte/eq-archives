I'm pretty sure Kerafyrm isn't killable.
Reports of during testing were that a GM was chaining Cazic Touch
(death touch which is instant 20,000hps damage) on Kerafyrm for 10
straight minutes without any change in Kerafyrm's health.

That may mean Kerafyrm has:

1.  Absolutely sick regen.
2.  Or reports of him having 2 billion hitpoints is true.

Remember, Verant did say they are not opposed to the idea of having
unkillable mobs in the game.

Something with near zero attack delay, quads for 1100+, and flurries
with that many hitpoints, in my book qualifies as "unkillable".
