What would you rather see as standard? MacOS? *n*x? SunOS?

IMHO, Windows is the best OS for the general public. *n*x for the more
hardcore user, MacOS for the people who'd rather not deal with the problems
Windows generates.

Actually, in my experiences, Windows is a helluva lot more stable than any
MacOS version I've used (7.5 through 9) .. You'd be amazed at how many times
IE/Nutscrape crashes on a Mac box when loading a big HTML page (50k+) ..
Even on the damn iMacs we had at school. I opened up SimpleText once and it
crashed, which in turn crashed the Finder, which generated a system error,
and the computer completely froze up when I clicked "Restart" (doesn't it
always?) ..

I don't have any experience with *n*x or SunOS, but I'm sticking to Windows
until something that I see as better comes out.
