Most of my serious pp has come from selling 60 - 64 spells. 
Parchments drop on a regular basis when soloing in HoH.  This is an
easy chanter solo, not sure how other classes would fare.

If its just pocket money Im looking for, a much underused area is the
giant fort in FM.  All the mobs are very very green, max hp is about
2500.  I just load up my animation pet, give him SoV & NDT & wander
around nuking stuff.  The spawn rate is very fast - I cant keep it
cleared although if you AE'd it you would.  The coin dropped is poor,
few gold & the odd pp but the loots, which are regular make up for it.
 Dumping it all to a merchant, weapons are 12 - 60pp a go, Belt
15ppish, tunic 62pp ish, earring 285pp.  I can make about 500pp in 30
mins which is easilly as quick as Rathe & generally I have the zone to
myself.  Just remeber to turn up with empty bags!
