}I think I will send a /feedback with the idea tonight. :)

I'll sit here and pray they don't take it.  I -like- the goofy pet names.  
I'd probably play my beastlord more if I wasn't partnered with Rarow's 
Warder all the time.

Especially Goner. :)

Being able to name my pet would be cool, though.  But that seems like it 
might be harder for them to implement.
