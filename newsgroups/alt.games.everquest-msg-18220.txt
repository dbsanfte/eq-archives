I must disagree.  the idiots should be allowed to die  quietly.  If some
poor sap in a private organization wants to protect them from
themselves... so be it. the government has no responsibility to protect
them.

Actually politically baby-eating satanists tend to be conservative. 
When comparing 2 people(parties) you don't compare them to an absolute
scale, unless there is an absolute scale.  In the case of politics/human
behaviour, there is really no absolute scale.  IMHO both the Republicans
and democrats(USA) are entirely to close to the left for my(libertarian)
tendancies.

And in the absence of anything else to compare it to. it is an accurate
comparison.

Once we figure out how to fix our mistakes we'll be better.  I'm no
Randian, but... Beliefs don't affect me politically, its the actions
that affect me.  and the bigger the gov't the more of my paycheck it
wants... conversely.. the bigger the gov't(I'm DoD ADAF)  The bigger my
paycheck(potentially).

Nah.  He hasn't yet tried exterminating the DEs or the Followers of
Bertoxx.

OK, I have tremendous admiration for someone who goes to the trouble of
learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
