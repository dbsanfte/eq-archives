Yeah I think bazaar will bury these sites, best way to do it really.

First thing I noticed was the plat people were selling went way up in
price on player auctions, of course due to the bazaar. Plat gained
value because every other day I see slime boots with 3 flowing thought
that my druid would die for,  78 k plat (on the trib server) You see a
fungi tunic a lot at around 79 k plat. 

Aahah I just checked on tribunal and 2 k plat is bid up to 11 bucks..
ahaha. Yep, prices are pretty ridiculous with hardly no one bidding. 
Auction site go boom I think.
