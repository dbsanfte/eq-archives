Minimum indifferent is not enough.  I played a lo level enchanter for a
while, and after I successfully completed the quest I decided that it
was a less boring way to raise cash than killing wisps, so I sold my
stein and did it again.  I /con'd Clurg with Illusion: DE up, and since
he was indifferent I didn't think to use Alliance, he proceeded to eat
my book.  (And no, it wasn't a case of /con'ing him while invis, I
/con'd him again after the failed turn-in, he was still indifferent).

But, if you are agnostic and have taken no negative faction hits with
Clurg (he has his own faction), then Illusion: DE along with Alliance
gives good enough faction.
