	As you say, that leaves the non-raid tanks out in the cold. I don't see 
why that should be acceptable to anyone.

	I would also like to point out that even for the non-raid other 
classes, Time Tanks (moreso then than now) don't exactly grow on trees 
or advertise their services to pickup groups. I'm actually glad of this 
fact, because I couldn't have gotten to where I am now if they did.
