I have never mele with my Necro since level 8.  Why would I?
I would die in a hot second in mele with no AC and few HP.
That is what my pet is for.  That being said I have a dagger
that gives me +3 or 5 int  (not sure which).  Have nearly
reached the soft cap of 200 int and can fear kite as well as
it can be done usually (not that I am a master player, just
fear kitiing is easy as long as spells stick).

Just find the best INT boosting stuff you can get and get
your smurf as big a mana pool as possible.  As soon as you
can get Jboots to save on SOW potions and you are set until
level 50 when the Necor class takes a bit of a dive (I am
told this, have yet to experience it).  Oh ya, and have fun
being evil.
