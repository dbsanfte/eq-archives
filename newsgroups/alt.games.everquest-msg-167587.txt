The "blow" isn't about being bested by another human player.

In most PK instances the Killer(s) hold an overwhelming advantage in
levels, numbers, or current state of health/mana. 90+% of all PKing is
NOT a fair fight or anything close to it. It's not much different than
getting squished by a sand giant at level 12 in Oasis. The all
important difference is that an AI mob like a SG won't actively decide
to ruin your evening and then use every means at thier disposal to do
so.The frustration generated isn't about "ego" it's simply the fact
the victim has no recourse and no chance/ability to defend themselves
in almost all cases.

The state of PvP in EQ (as well as most of the players that engage in
it) is just not "mature" enough to draw any real numbers.
