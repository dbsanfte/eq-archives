    There's an even way to explain it:

    People are buying EQ accounts for the sole purpose of stripping them,
selling the pieces, then selling the actual account.

    We've noticed this trend with a few of our ex-guildmates' accounts.
Sold, then sold again stripped of the droppables and plat a short time
later. Presumably the droppables are also being sold off for cash, too.
Right now the hacker that is our own personal nightmare, Khatup/Salival etc.
has four accounts which he shuffles stolen goods between. He's aiming to get
his monk (the only character he actually cares about) AoW legs, but in the
meantime he sells off other droppables via playerauctions. Right now he has
a gnome mask he stole. =(
