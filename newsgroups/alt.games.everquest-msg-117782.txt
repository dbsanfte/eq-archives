That is just under 1 day pr. level !!!

Whats the fun in that???
Do you know your way around your local area????
Do you know what critters there are in your local area??
Have you any idea what your hometown looks like???

The game is journey to level 60, not a destination !!

I feel sorry for you, I don't think you have seen the game.

And in case that your Rogue is your character no. 23
I would look around for another game, cause you are
apparently bored with EQ if the only thing that matters
is to find some way to get from lvl 1 to 60 in 2 weeks time


Just my 2 cents
