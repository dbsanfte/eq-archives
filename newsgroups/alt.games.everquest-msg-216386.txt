Oh, now thats a whole new conversation.  You have a set fixed amount of time to run a dungeon, but you have
plenty of time to buff up, get FM, go use the little monk's room etc etc before going in and after getting your
mission.  If you aren't waiting till fully ready, then you sir are doing dungeons that are simply too easy for
you.  When you said "I go for the win" I didn't realize you meant "I'm the sort of person who does crushbone at
30, cause then its a cakewalk"

Knowing how to play the class doesn't enter into it.  The situation is this: Pull Rate is such that the cleric's
mana is back at X before every pull.  Stop wriggling around and trying to find a way out of that.  We can
discuss whether such a situation can or cannot exist some other time.  For the sake of this argument, accept it
as a given.  No matter how competant or incompetant the cleric (or other healer) may be, there is some rate of
pull at which he stays at about the same mana level each cycle, some other rate at which he loses some mana,
net, every pull, and some other rate at which he gains some mana, net, every pull.  Under discussion, solely the
first rate.

Hard mission, soft mission, mission full of toilet paper, thats irrelevant.  Situation is that -if- FM is needed
for some reason (whatever that may be), medding to full is the option.

No, they can't pull most of the fights any earlier.  Thats a mathematical impossibility.  IF you use a total of
X mana to run the entire dungeon, then you use that much mana.  Your regen rate (for the sake of this arguement)
is identical.  Your mana use (for the sake of this argument) is identicle.  You are using (for the sake of this
argument) exactly the same tactics in every regard except one... Group A pulls a bunch of mobs fast at the
beginning till the healer gets to 30M, then pulls at precisely the rate needed to keep him at 30M, Group B pulls
at that same rate from the beginning, all the way thru, keeping their healer at 80M.

Group A doesn't get to do "the next few fights a bit earlier" because they can't, they have to keep the same
fixed pull rate as group B, or their healer mana will drop further, disqualifying them from the discussion.
They don't get to finish the last few fights a bit earlier, because that would also disqualify them from the
discussion at hand.  Not to mention, if they continue to pull at the "faster than the healer regens mana" rate,
their healer keeps losing net mana and is soon at OOM, whereupon they wipe.  But lucky for them, they can't do
that, because thats group C: pull at a high rate of speed for 30% longer than group A did, run OOM, and die.
Stay with A and B.

Its not a question of "play to win" or "play to lose".  Its simple math.  No wriggling, no wishing, no religious
conviction needed here.   Stay on target; both group A and B play in an identical fashion with the sole
exception that group A pulls at 30M while group B pulls at 80M.  Both groups, for the sake of this discussion,
are equally motivated.  In fact, just to help make sure of that, neither group can actually see their mana
bars.  Hows that.  Its a blind operation, neither group even knows whether they have 30M or 80M.  They play in
exactly the same style with the same gear and are in all ways identical, except that group A has less mana when
they start pulling.  Is group A or group B in a better position.

This is true, see my parenthetical about shaman.  Still, by and large, if one person is LOM and everyone else is
FM, then someone isn't being a team player; either the LOM guy is blowing mana like crazy, or the rest of the
group is being too conservative.  None of this is really relevant to the issue at hand, though.

Because I'm talking about an hour of pulls, 60 mobs in a row, when I say "all mana needed for a fight is
generated during that fight"; and the 80M isn't needed for those pulls.  I grant you that.  BUT when the shit
hits the fan, the tank goes LD, an outlandish overpull happens, a crate gets popped open accidentally, whatever,
then you use your reserves.  With 80M you have nearly three times as much mana in reserve as you do at 30M.
This is precisely what we are talking about.  Can you possibly have missed that point during this entire thread?

The only difference between group A and group B is the size of their "shit hit the fan" reserve.  Any other
difference you may want to bring up, stop, realize that by definition it does not apply, and start over.

The LDoN adventure under discussion lasts 55 minutes for group A and 55 minutes for group B.  Hows that, you
say?  Because Group A pulls at an accelerated rate for 5 minutes till they get to 30M, then pulls at rate X for
the remaining 50 minutes.  Group B pulls at rate X for 50 minutes, then blows out their remaining mana finishing
the final fight, thus also finishing in 5 minutes.  The two groups are identical in every way other than the
amount of mana they have during the 50 minutes of normal pulls.

Stop wriggling.  If you can show some way, based strictly on the amount of mana in the pool, that group A regens
mana faster than Group B, lets talk.  I'll give you a hint; I've already shown, earlier in the thread, why group
D, which maintains FM, is in fact slower than groups A and B.  And I've also shown how group E, which maintains
0 mana in pull, is also slower; that had to do with the fact that continuously rezzing for a wipe on every mob
tends to slow things down a bit.

I used to do that when duoing with a warrior sometimes, when the warrior is the only DPS, increasing his output
about 10% is a pretty decent deal.  At least there is a benefit to it, however slight.

Now show the same benefit to having 30% mana that you can show with 30% HP (on a warrior) and you'll have
something that could tip the scales in your favor.  Group A would have more mana regen (or something, whatever
the benefit is) so their pull rate would be X+, while the group B rate would be a mere X.

But I'm unaware of any such benefit.

If you are saying that group A is more fun just because its working without a net, then you might also have a
point.  At least it would be something.  And if LDoN dungeons are so trivial for you that there are practically
no situations where more than 30M would ever be required, then I suppose the risk is so tiny that the reward in
adding to the percieved risk might count for something.  But personally, I'd either step up to Difficult, cut
down to 4 man groups, or quit thinking of anything I was doing in terms of it being good tactics.  HtH melee
(thats no weapon, just fists, mind you) is good tactics for my 65 cleric clearing crushbone.  Not so good on
dark blue flies in POD though, even though I can certainly solo them if I play well instead of crazy.
