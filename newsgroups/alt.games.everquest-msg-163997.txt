Yes, this is my ideal situation for Kael.

2 DC enchanters with pets that don't suck (IE the Iceshard Bros.), 2 druids,
sharing a normal charmed pet 4x231 hitting wolf that summons (if one gets
summoned, other recharms), a cleric for those "oh fuck" moments, and a
monk/sk/necro to feign split stuff.

Hell, you could double up the rez/feigning with the necro... if he's willing
to burn through the souls of ebay.  And another pet for DPS!  wheeeha!

Actually having a melee class in this situation would suck, because when
given a choice between a 200+ dps wolf charmed pet or a 40 dps monk, the mob
will always choose to pound the monk.
