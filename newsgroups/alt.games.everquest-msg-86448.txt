*bzzt* WRONG

I just auction in EC.  THAT'S my solution.

And the bazaar/nexus is NOT the most convenient spot to bind for me since I
don't need to use the spires back down.

Places I've bound recently (i.e. last 10 levels or so)
Gornit's camp (for waiting on camp from someone else)
Everfrost near Ice Giants (checking rare spawns in Perma and hunting IGs
with a friend, didn't bother with the SFG run since I always get lost in the
canyon part of EF)
Ry'gorr fort (after 3 deaths in EW/CC I got tired of running from Iceclad
every time)
Tenebrous Mtns near Grimling forest zone (waiting for Grimling Runner, still
haven't found that bastard for payback)
Overthere (before I could port to Skyfire)
Thurgadin (before I could port myself to GD)
