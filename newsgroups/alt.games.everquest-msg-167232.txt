Has happened to me before.  I can't wait until I am able to beat the sh*t out of
Grimfeather.  I think I'll spend a week or so just keeping the zone clear of this bastard
for the others in the zone.  For now, if I need to log off in NK, I do so inside the guard
tower on the bridge to SK, making sure I am near a guard or two.
