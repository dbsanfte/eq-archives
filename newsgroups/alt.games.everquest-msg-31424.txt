	I think you're wrong there.  As I recall, after putting my
initial points into alchemy I couldn't improve it beyond 5 points
above my level.  The alchemy skill is first available around level 25
or 30, so he'd have to get a character that high just to start
alchemy.  He wouldn't have much success with gate potions at that
level; sort of like trying to smith fine plate right after sharpening
rusty weapons became trivial.
