No clue... I doubt it would fly in court though.

  'Listen to me, you stupid bint. This gem is everything I came back to 
Sunnydale for, which has witnessed some truly spectacular kickings of my 
ass. Now, when I have the gem, they'll all die, don't worry. But until 
then, stay inside. And by the way, I would be insanely happy if I heard 
bugger all about sodding France.'

A couple other of favorite Buffy quotes of mine:

  'So, I'm wondering, do the other cookie animals feel sorta ripped? Like, 
is the hippo going, 'Hey, man, where are my pants? I have my hippo 
dignity!'And you know the monkey's just, 'I mock you with my monkey 
pants!''

'I like you. You're funny, and you're nicely shaped. And frankly, it's 
ludicrous to have these interlocking bodies and not... interlock. Please 
remove your clothing now.'

'You're not friends. You'll never be friends. You'll be in love till it 
kills you both. You'll fight, and you'll shag, and you'll hate each other 
till it makes you quiver, but you'll never be friends. Love isn't brains, 
children, it's blood... blood screaming inside you to work its will. I may 
be love's bitch, but at least I'm man enough to admit it.'
