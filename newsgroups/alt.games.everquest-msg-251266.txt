Well your out then I guess... :-)   Artical in PCGamer mag stated from the
head honcho at EQ2 said that even with that kinda supper dupper machine one
still coudn't run all the video settings at max!  He told PCG'er that SOE
was working with Nvidia on building a board that could support all of EQ2's
video pretties. Oh, btw thats after about 300 patches to get the basic video
to where 90% of thoes who bought the game could actually even play it but of
course he neglected to mention that little detail!
