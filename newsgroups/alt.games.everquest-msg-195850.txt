Lower Level * 1.5, approximately.

At the low end, lower level + 5 more or less

The caveats are there because there seems to be some wriggle room, some cases
you find you can group with someone one level higher than you thought, or in
some cases you can't group with someone of a level you thought you could.

I -think- its because the range is actually based on your current experience
counts not your levels; thus someone who just barely leveled up to 20 might not
be able to group with someone who is almost 41, while someone who is almost 11
might be able to group with someone who is barely 31.  Then there're racial and
class bonus's and penalties to consider, although they might not matter after
all.

I  have not researched this thoroughly, just a surmise based on observing that
level based calculation didn't always quite cover things.

At any rate, level 1 can group with level 5, level 44 can group up to 65, those
are the two bookends.  You may find some 43's can group with some 65s... and
some not.
