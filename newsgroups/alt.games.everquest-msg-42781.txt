Wow, just installed a new AGP 64MB GEForce2 MX400 last night.  It replaced
my 16MB Voodoo card.  What a difference it makes.  I have the resolution
jacked up high enough that it's hard to read the text on the buttons now,
and I had to increase the chat font size.  I haven't tried WW or the LoIO
zone area in FV, those will be the real tests.  So far, it is awesome the
difference it makes.  I was running the Voodoo at 1024x768, with clipping
maxed, and it performed OK everywhere but the areas with huge numbers of
trees in Kunark.  The only thing I have seen so far with the new card, is
that people seem to be jumping up and down more.
