Announced where?

Alpha Centuri, no doubt.  Hyperspace Bypass, EQ patch, its always the same
excuses on the part of the construction company.

But in this case I'd actually heard something about it, so it was
certainly a possibility.  I'd also heard it had been delayed several times
and might not go off on schedule today either.

It didn't have to be a surprise to be unpleasant.  If you were scheduled
for a root canal tomorrow, would it be any more pleasant to recall that
you set up the appointment three weeks ago, than if you went in for a
simple cleaning and they found something nasty and you and they both had
time to do it right then?
