I think everyone covered the ways.  You can get maps of the areas at
http://www.eqatlas.com as well, including connection and zone maps.  If, by
chance, you happen to be on Tunare, let me know--I'll take you out there and
back for free.  (Or pick it up for you, but I'm all for the spirit of
adventure. :>)
