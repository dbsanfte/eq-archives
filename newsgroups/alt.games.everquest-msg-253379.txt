As someone who played (roleplayed) a female toon for many years it
took me actually hurting someone accidentally to decide to stop.
Essentially, another player 'fell in love' (yes, I realise how
warped that is) with the character I was playing, who didn't exist.
Now, I didnt talk about RL, and I carefully avoided questions of
gender, but even still. It freaked me out a bit. Especially as I
essentially played a gender neutral deluded elf who thought she was
a dog (literally. Wolf form all the way. Eep, wheres my fur gone?
Wag tail.)

Since then I havent roleplayed so intensively, and I've often
regretted the loss of both the fun I had being a dappy female elf.
More, though, I've regretted making my toon female at all. I hate
the reactions it gets if you're openly 'a guy playing a female
toon'. I hate the people who feel the need to loudly inform everyone
you're a guy and go out of their way to correct anyone who attempts
to indulge in roleplay with you (STOP CALLING HIM HER, ITS A HIM
DAMMIT. Yes, people do this.) or come up with marvelous terms like
'mangina' all the time.

The real coup de grace was when I realised a woman I very much liked
thought I was a woman in RL and was confiding in me on the basis
of things that weren't true about me. (Solely my gender, not the
things I said, but still).  So, now I don't avoid the question, I
tell anyone who asks I'm a guy and I feel its the only way to address
it given what transpired.

But. But. It has pretty much destroyed that engaging suspension of
reality I loved about EQ, and my ability to suspend the cynical
critical analytical me of real life and become a demented childish
puppy online, to just 'play'. And I can kind of see how someone in
that situation, without thinking it through, might think the best
thing to do is 'kill' the character rather than lead people on about
its existence. Its a quick clean get out without having to face up
to telling the people you've deceived, deliberately or otherwise,
who care about you, that you're not who they think you are.

I had some nasty moments with that. Most people were just 'hahaha,
fuck, we *really* thought you were a girl in RL', but one or two
had evidently made 'real' friendships with me and it took a while
to come through. They felt betrayed. Eventually, they sort-of-forgave,
but yeah. I regret it.

Just an alternative possible view on why he might have done what
he did (of course, not knowing him or the situation its equally
possible he's a butt monkey who did it cause he was drunk on a dare
and didnt give a shit about anyone, I suppose.)

The more I hear about test the more I like the sound of it, to be honest.
