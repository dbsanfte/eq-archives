Yes, I agree with you entirely. What with the lack of loot in these
missions, it is the lower-level types who will benefit most.  My 25
cleric was getting half a level per mission, making new friends,
having a lot of fun and enjoying being in a full-sized group.  Nice
change from the way it has been of late.

Again, very true.  Although getting levels fast, you have to balance
this with the fact that your skills absolutely suck.  Thus, time spent
pounding the skills up ia also required.  Mind you, there will be
those who won't bother with this, hit level 50, who can't then even
cast a 30 spell without 10 fizzles  ;)
