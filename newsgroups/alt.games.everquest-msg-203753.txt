Seems like your doing the right thing to me. Attack the feared mob yourself.

Starting at lvl 8 you get a mana regeneration spell called Dark Pact. It
drains 4 of your hit points per tick and converts into 2 mana per tick.
COmbined with your life tapping spells its very useful... And later on in
life it is very powerful.
