My wife and I saw the movie and we both loved it.  I've read the books and
she hasn't.  We both think it's a finely crafted film. Direction, editing,
sound, music, design and acting are all top notch.  I love the books and
think the films does justice to it.  As someone else pointed out, it is
difficult to take a long novel and make it into a good movie without losing
anything.  I think LotR does a fantastic job of capturing the sense of
wonder and adventure that is in the book. We both can't wait for the next
one!!

Happy and Mrs. Camper
