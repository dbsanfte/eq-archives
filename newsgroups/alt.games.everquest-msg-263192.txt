    Dark blue at 52 implies level 51 or lower critters. A quick check of 
Allakhazam's shows they're exactly level 51. This means they'll be blue 
until level 66 or so (15 level spread), and will give bonus XP to characters 
from levels 51 to 55 (5 level spread). The player you're looking at is red 
to you, so 59 or above - the stalkers give him no XP bonus but are likely 
still dark blue to him.

    The XP slowed down because you lost the XP bonus. At 52, you were 
getting a 40% bonus for each kill because of the assumed difficulty. At 56, 
you're getting no bonus. The bonus is 50% on an even-con mob when you're 
above level 50, and the bonus goes up/down in increments of 10% per level 
you are below/above being even con to the mob, to a minimum of no bonus.

    He's plowing through easy mobs to rack up the AA's. Lots of folks do it 
when soloing. There's also some macros that can be set up in Plane of 
Nightmares to gain AA's while not at keyboard - the character may have been 
a bot.

    You get no XP for greens. Light blues give relatively crummy XP (just a 
fraction of what they would give if dark blue). In general, killing light 
blues stinks for XP, no matter how fast you can plow through them. The one 
exception I've seen is AE groups, where you can kill 60+ mixed blues and 
light blues at once.
