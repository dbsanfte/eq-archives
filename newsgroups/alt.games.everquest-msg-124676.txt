How is a list fair?

I want my epic, so does James.  Because hes in the "uber guild" that
enforces this list, does that mean he starts first on the list, whilst I
compete for a place from 10-30 on the list?

How do you create the initial list order?  I dont believe there is ANY fair
way.

Who can get on the list?  I think I'll get my level 10 cleric on the list,
he should be ~55 by the time its my turn on the list.

What happens if when its my turn, Rage pops at 3am and Im sleeping?  Should
the entire server wait for me to log on the following day so I can kill it?
(Reducing the number of Rage pops)

What if my guild is in the middle of a raid/pull when Rage pops.. everybody
sits and waits while my guild fights/C.R's and then comes to help me?

What if I help people camp Rage for weeks and weeks and weeks, waiting
patiently for my turn. And then when it finally comes to me, im offline that
day?

What happens if a guild has 10 clerics needing epics, do they get 10
consecutive slots on the list?  If not, why not?

What can you *really* do to a guild that opposes this list?

Prexus went FCFS because the lists and rotations were unfair.  They were
guild-ran, so of course there were biased.  The "punishments" were issued by
1 person in yet another guild, all guilds have allies, and guilds they don't
get on with (which was shown in punishments imo)

Who decides the entry requirements on said mob?  How do you ensure that its
fair?

The first guild (who managed the rotations on Prexus) automatically joined
each mob rotation, without any test to pass, no time-scale pressures etc, so
are they really in a position to create a "fair" entry test?

And I guess ultimately, who are you to tell any player or guild how they can
play *their* game?  (as long as its fair and legal play, obviously)

>>you've just hit the shit list of my guild, the other big guild, and at
least half a dozen
>>mid-level guilds

Why would that really worry people anyway?

Theres a really good example on Prexus how sanctions and shitlists (even
server wide) can't force or push people into things. Acting like a bully
won't make everybody crumble, by god after everything me and my guild has
been through after we went FCFS, I should know.
