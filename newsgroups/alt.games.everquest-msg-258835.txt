I'd say it would depend. ie depending on what he is soloing (their atk 
relative to his AC), how he is equipped, and whether or not he picks up 
AC buffs in pok... he may well be able to afford the AC hit and not even 
notice it.

(ie his AC may be down far enough the mobs are hitting for max damage 
often enough that another 30AC off the top might make almost no 
difference... or his AC might be up high enough that lowering it 30 
points might still put him safely beyond what he needs to be to have to 
keep mob damage more or less at a mininum.

If the +atk can be borrowed or is cheap, or can be flipped back in the 
bazaar without a net loss, I'd say give it a try...
