I'm a dark elf necro most of the time. Complete with pet.

I get asked for ports, clarity and/or SoW at least once a week.

And I've never been on /role or /anon.

/bonk idiots.

I can deal with the "Can you summon my corpse or help me find it" stuff. But
it's never as bad. I'm probably never going back to my shaman or cleric
again.
