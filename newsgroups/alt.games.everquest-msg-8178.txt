-More and better-run dynamic. I'd like to see a team of GMs hired on
who are dedicated entirely to such quests. QMs, you could call 'em.
Make it clear that these people are NOT there to help with rezzes,
corpse retreival, breaking up fights, etc.

-A more reliable con system. Hell, if something cons blue, I should be
able to take it if I'm properly equipped for my level...with a good
fight. Take the class and their strengths/weaknesses into account,
maybe even current HP. If it's green, it should NOT be able to kill me
unless I do something stupid (Like forget to turn autoattack on...)
[Not bloody likely, probably a pain in the ass to do, but would be
nice]

-More archery improvements, especially for Rangers. Proc'ing bows and
arrows. Give rangers a "multishot" ability - each "attack" with the
bow fires an increasing number of arrows as the Ranger gains levels,
probably maxing at 4 at lvl 60. Not huge, but nice. Damage bonus with
the bows for Rangers and/or increased bow crit probability. Rangers
are lightly armored, they should be able to fight from the back lines
effectively.

-FIX THE FREAKING BARD DRUM ANIMATION! Looks absolutely absurd
strumming a flute when I should be beating a drum...

-Everyone should be able to solo feasably. Sure, maybe not as good as
Druids and Necros, but it should be a realistic option for, say,
clerics instead of making them sit on their ass in LOIO for hours
because all the existing groups have their fill of healers.

-More useful trade products. Cost is one issue. By the time your
average player can afford Fine Steel, he can generally get better as
drops. Ornate chain...It's useful, yeah, but making it is unreasonably
expensive. Velious tailoring. Do I need to say more? Pottery, brewing.
Baking did get a huge boost with the food change.

There's more. I'll think of 'em later.
