Yes I totally agree.  Infact I think that just reinforces my take on it
too... any fool can use lull, it takes a real player to do the cool shit.
Im at a level beyond lulling and harmonying adds, I also know I can output
any non-excellant bard.  That was the point of my initial response. To claim
monks couldn't hold their own is utter bs, I know several monks whos pulling
forces the bard to be DAMN GOOD to even compete with them

Well of course it can be increased via the appropriate mod.  I must admit
though, I don't see our bards whip out a drum unless its raid time, at the
serious mobs stage.

Why not just malos on inc anyway, if its a tough mob? Its almost zero agro
(so the mob won't steamroll you when it gets to camp).. and i can't think of
very many exp mobs who resist turg after malos.  My shaman does have his GoD
slow... but I can't recall when i last cast it.   Before the vxed named
nerf, when we were spell farming perhaps?

But then you are losing the benefit of his dps and songs.  Ok so his dps
isn't so hot, but his songs generally go a long way in making up for this.

So not only do you have the bard doing longer pulls (slower), but you also
have 1 less person contributing to that mobs death (even slower).  That
doesn't seem to go with the statement that using bard over monk made such a
huge difference to your win time.

So even if the monk takes 10 seconds longer to split, he saves 3-4 seconds
with a shorter pull distance, and 30-60? by contributing DPS and making it
die faster.

Barely.  A gimp bard will still go down hella fast (even as a plate class,
they sure don't tank like it).  Agreed they can take more of a beating than
a silk class, but also factor in the 5kHP enc is gonna have about 2k in
runes, so were already upto 7k again.  Not sure about channeling (ie getting
the spell through the mobs smackdown) because both the bard and enc have
always just been secondary tools for me.. so i'll let some other expert
answer that one.

Well sortof.  If im with a guild group (aka post-time geared people) we
don't split or pull mobs, we just charge a room and let the chanter sort out
the mess while were smacking something.  In hard ldons where I pull, im not
with 5 time+ geared people.  Like i said most ldons, a lot of ldons i do,
theres just 2 of us.

Well you said bards were faster at pulling, but then talked about things
like debuffs and pre slows.  Thats utility, not really pulling, so in that
case you have to include chanters, shamans, beastlords etc too!

I did a karnors group once (back in the "old" everquest), 5 monks and a
bard.  Now that group really flew! :)

But the higher up you go, the less reliance you can have on some of those
tools, and more so reliance is needed on skill.
Im talking lull specifically, any fool with a pacify can single pull at a
lightening pace, but get above that levelset of mobs and their advantage
isnt as great.

Well maybe. In a 4-twisting group contribution sense sure. In a "i have
pacify, i can single pull with ease" sense they are much easier at lower
levels.  Clerics and paladins can split easier than monks (when everybody is
a gimp) thanks to lull afterall!
