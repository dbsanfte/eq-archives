It comes from a spell. If you got to eq.crgaming.com and look at the Necro
spell lists it will give you the names of the spells that are pet spells.

They will be purchasable from any necro guild including your home town's
one.

Then you just cast the spell and a pet appears to give orders to. 
It uses bone chips as a component so if my SK experience is anything to go
by make sure you always have plenty of these on you and a spare set in the
bank.
