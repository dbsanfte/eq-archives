Just off the top of my head here.

1. Enchanter mezes.

2. Monk could FD pull.  Necro has a chance, but low HP.  SK has a lot more
HP.

3. Ranger/Druid/Necro/SK/(anyone with appropriate item) snares one, and
trains the rest off, once the snared one is far enough behind, someone else
in group pulls the snared one back to the rest of the group.  Ranger keeps
the others occupied.
