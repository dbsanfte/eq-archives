There's a file in your EQ directory called datarate.txt.
The setting in that file controls the bandwidth setting
for the software, with higher settings reflecting more
bandwidth available for client/server communications.

Other than that, there are a variety of settings which
affect game performance by either "tuning" the rendering
engine (such as whether or not to show spell effects,
which models or textures to render, etc) as well as
whether the server should filter communications or the
client (doing so at the server level means you don't
get some messages your client will discard, such as
auctions if you're filtering them.)  Those settings are
discussed in the manual supplement file, also in your
EQ directory.
