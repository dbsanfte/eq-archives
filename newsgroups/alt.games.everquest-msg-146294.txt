During the times that I typically play, and strictly from personal
observation, most of the people I see playing are grouped, even if they are
of the good soloing classes.  About the only zone where I typically see more
soloers than groupers is CS.  Certainly there are classes other than druids
that do solo, and do so quite effectively.  I have soloed my shaman at most
levels, up to my current level of 55.  I group far more often than I solo.
