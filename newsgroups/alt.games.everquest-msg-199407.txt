Necros can do several things.  One, is aggro kite the mob while pet 
destroys it from behind.  Another is root and rot.

Given that I have benn soloing my shaman in PoN since level 57, you are 
completely full of it.  (No gimp CH or epic at the time)

Hint:  Root, Slow, DoT, DoT, reapply root and DoTs as needed.  Cann and 
regen mana while mob is rotting, when mob dies, go get another one.

Even at level 61, I don't use my new pet in PoN for soloing, because he 
dies too fast.

Damn you, I am going to have to pull you out of the KF for entertainment 
purposes.
