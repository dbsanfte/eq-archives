Oh I did not think of that, the pet buff window only had the charm in it,
heehee good, I had agro first thus the moron was 100% wrong.....I feel
better now having not been in the wrong in that instance myself

aye I thought of that too, I was very low health at the time and would have
looked like I wanted to train the zone. if a gm said anything i would have
blathered and excues that i thuoh i recharmed it but got the wrong
spell.....i know tho that is the 0.01% chance they need for him to get
satisfaction.

Others than that I did good, bit my tounge and said not a word...not that it
is easy to chat and be a good bard anyway (or stay alive) lol



on another small topic, I changed ISP's a few hours after I posted this and
when I join this group with the other ISP, I did not see my original
message....is that normal?
