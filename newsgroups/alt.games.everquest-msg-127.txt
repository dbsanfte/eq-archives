>Can I press Hide button then sit down? The skill will rise by itself?

No, the skill is checked when you hit the button. Raises are only possible
then.

>So, what about Sneak? Press the button then sit again? or I have to move
>around?

The same.

That is assuming that these things are aquired as a result of your CLASS
and not RACE. You didn't mention what class you were, so we have to guess.
If you are a dark elf warrior, your hide will never go up. If you are a
halfling cleric, your sneak will never go up. Monks can get their sneak up,
and rogues can do both, regardless of race.

>How about swimming? What if I sing water breath song and sink into the sea?

You have to be moving for swim to go up, just standing underwater doesn't
do it.
