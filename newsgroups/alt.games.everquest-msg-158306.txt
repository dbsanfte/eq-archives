Who said druids should be second best at nuking, healing, DS'ing

It sounds like you consider the druid class too powerful overall.
You are, of course, entitled to your opinion on that subject.

In Ingot's defense, I'm not quite sure that's true.

Clerics are marketed as the best healers and rezzers in the game.
Wizards are marketed as the best nukers in the game.  Mages are
marketed as the best pet class in the game.  Etc, etc, etc.

Ingot made a class choice in large part because Verant marketed
druids as the best travelers in the game.  There's nothing unusual
or surprising about choosing a class because of a few abilities
that happen to appeal to you.

And if cleric NPCs that could res for free were scattered throughout
the world, nobody would feel sympathy for all the clerics who chose
"healer and rezzer" as their life calling.

I think this is a load of <bleep>.  People OFTEN choose classes
because of a few abilities that happen to appeal to them.  To see
that ability given to anyone that coughs up $30 *is* a justified
reason to feel bummed out.

The lack of sympathy isn't because he pigeonholed himself, because
ALL classes are pigeonholed in one way or another.  The lack of
sympathy is because a.g.e posters are downright cranky.  It's cool
and in-style to abuse people in a.g.e.  Pretty weird community...

You are making the same mistake in logic so many others are making
on this subject.  If you have $10 in your wallet, it's value CAN
go down due to inflation, even though you STILL have that $10.  You
haven't lost a single dollar, but yet it's value has gone down
nonetheless.
