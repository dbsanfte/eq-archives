If you want to re-roll as a Vah Shir, there's a group of folks from the 
eqlive forums who are trying a tuesday night get-together thing.  We are 
  still under 10 so not that much to catch up with.  The guy who started 
it had a bright idea to have a Vah Shir only group.  It's fun, we are 
doing the quests and running around the pit.
