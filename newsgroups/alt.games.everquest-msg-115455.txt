Does anyone think that adding the Surefall port has changed this for
Qeynos?  I haven't seen much of a difference.  If you're of a level to
port/be ported around, the only thing near Surefall worth visiting is
Everfrost/Permafrost.  Erudin and the Karanas have their own port
points, and there's nothing in Qeynos/QHills that a mid/high level
player would want, other than the occasional quest.  I guess the
Pyzjin campers are happy.  ;)

I'm glad they put the port in as it makes it quicker to go check on
the Ice Giants...
