I have to agree 100% with everything that Bob said.

In fact this was the very same reason I QUIT EQ for six months. I did not
get back on until Velious was released - then after getting killed to death
(lvl 28 trying to visit velious) I decided to earn a few levels and try to
get back there - So I had to buy Kunark to do that.

Since I have a few new lands to cover I am being entertained for a while
longer. As fdar as I have seen it is in the top 5 of all games I currently
own.

Then again - I still think it was all started by "A bards tale" (C-64) and
UO was basically an expansion to "A faerytale adventure" (amiga).

And those were there to keep me busy when I could not find a good GM to lead
a campaign.
