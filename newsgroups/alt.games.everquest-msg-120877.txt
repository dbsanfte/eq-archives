Bah, NM.  I was referring to the ac/avoidance gain vs. pure AC at sub-100
agi levels, not the effect on missing.  Final word as I see it is that 
there is no way to increase my damage short of STR/ATK buffs, haste gear,
or better ratio weap. As far as the issue of missing alot... I guess thats
just a fact of life?
