Oh, I realise my druid's melee is pretty weak compared to any real
DPS class.  But sometimes it seems useful anyway.  E.g., if I'm
root-rotting and the mob hp is down in the 20s when the dots wear
off, I might go up and beat on it to get it to run (snared, of
course), and then continue beating on it to kill it.  I'm actually
not sure if that's more efficient than throwing one more dot and
medding.  But if there are green KOS mobs around, it might not be
feasible for me to med because of sitting agro(*), so I might as
well go up and finish it off.  (And if I start whacking before it's
quite ready to run, I can get some mileage out of my DS, plus it
lets my hp regen do something useful.)

And then, the other night, I found myself in an odd LDON pickup
group.  Usually, when I'm playing the druid, I look to see what the
group is missing, and the druid fills it in.  But this particular
group had a cleric for healing, a ranger pulling/snaring/tracking,
an enchanter for CC and nuking, and a shadowknight and warrior for
tanking and DPS.  So once I had buffed everyone and medded back up,
I was doing backup healing/snaring/rooting, and some nuking, but if
I didn't want to nuke (tanks didn't have solid agro yet, or mob was
low enough the nuke would be overkill) I figured I might as well go
up and add my DPS to the mix.
