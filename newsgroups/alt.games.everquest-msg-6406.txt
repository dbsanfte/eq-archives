Did you verify that it actually WAS a guide/GM?  I wouldn't
put it past that guy to have one of his friends send you a
tell saying, "Guide Xyz here, how may I help you?"

To verify whether someone is actually a guide/GM, just do a
/who on their name.  It will say "GM" or "Guide" in the
information you get back from the "/who".

And if it WASN'T actually a guide/GM (I can't believe a real
one would respond the way you say), the impersonator can
get banned almost instantly for claiming to be one when he's
not.
