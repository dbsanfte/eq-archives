    First off, you laid out the rules, and you adhered to them yourself. You
even tried to win the augments, and failed. So no bitching from the peanut
gallery should be tolerated. Having said that, we do it the way they
described: roll for augs as you go, then do loot items at the end. It makes
the process a lot more relaxed, instead of having people weigh whether they
want an unknown loot item, or that +6 DR augment that dropped that would be
nice. They want the aug, they roll on the aug. They want the loot, later on
they roll on the loot. I've been the one that's taken the hit on this policy
most times (something like 23-1 with two augs total to my name and five loot
items), since my rolls are poo, but I'm happy with it.
