Yeah, I felt sorta weird reporting a guy, but he did tell me straight that
he planned to KS.  Right out in the open.  Not in /tell or anything.
And there were 1 GM and 3 guides on...figured what could it hurt?
I can promise on all that is holy that if he'd reacted first to Hadden I'd
have left him alone and /cheer'd for him if he'd gotten the earring.

Yeah, except a 43 rogue has a harder time doing that than a 58 wizard.
My 60 could have twinked my  43 one, but what's the fun in that? I'd
rather have another one that I'd "earned" sitting on my ass and waiting
(that first time...after that first kill, it was pretty easy to know when
he'd
spawn).  I hate sitting in EC, and every single bit of armor my 43 is
wearing
she got it earning exp in groups and lucked out on rolls or after losing
a roll, bought it from a group-mate for a decent price (or was just given
if it was an upgrade and in a guild group...we're very NBG).  Same thing,
and I know I could've just bought one, but earning one yourself is still
kinda neat...Hadden is one of those guys that everybody's known about
since release, but I never camped with any character at all.  Was kinda
fun just to gank him a few times to say I had ;-).
