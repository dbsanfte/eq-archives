I'm not worried so much about Verant.  It's the big corporate, totally
detached from the EQ / Verant Culture, Sony bean-counters that I'm worried
about.  The folks that want numbers and have the authority to push a
decision contrary to VI's (and our) wishes.

I'm not taking a poke at Sony.  Just at the corporate mentality that a lot
of us have seen in action.  People miles away from the action making
money based desisions.
