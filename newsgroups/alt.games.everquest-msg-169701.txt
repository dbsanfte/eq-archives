While this is true on mobs that are blue all the way up to 60, at 61+, the jump
in the lowest level of blue means that mobs we can effectively melee solo for
exp start to become endangered species.  Then add the high exp requirements
post 60 which mean that only POP mobs yeild interesting amounts of exp per
kill... but look at the massive melee output of those mobs, and you realize
your days of melee soloing for exp are pretty much over with.

Its nice being able to go in to old world dungeons and cherry pick loot
dropping mobs (pacification to single pull anything you can't pull just because
of level) on a lark, but there's no noticable exp doing so.

I haven't found MoK to be worth the mana to cast in a very long time; it gives
back very small amounts of HP per blow, something in the 3 to 6 range.  While
this was great for lower level monks, who mitigated a LOT of damage and hit the
mob very fast, for a cleric soloing, I'd try subbing Stun in to your list
instead.  Every stun that lands is six more seconds the mob isnt' hitting you,
but only takes a couple seconds away from your hitting them.  Better still, you
can stun, target yourself, heal, and go back to the "fair fight" without having
taken a beating while healing (and without having the heal interrupted)

MOR is a serious damage producer for a solo melee cleric, since your target mob
is unslowed.  If you can get one, theres a drop off Ragefire that gives you a
clicky DS, 9 points I think (its either gloves or arms, the two parts I don't
have yet of his armor) that stacks with MOR for even more DS damage.  Potion DS
would also be an option, but really that's cost prohibitive unless you just
want to show off.
