Doubt it a lot if they were going to kill Tunare who is unkillable for
most guilds (I think it took a rather large alliance on one server to
bring her down)

I frankly don't even run around up there much when ANY guild is doing
the plane, its just not wise for a druid. As far as "giving them
strength" don't, because quite a few ways you can "help" them could
possibly get you faction drops.

The incredibly worthless bear pet spell, which every druid MUST HAVE
until they actually get it ;), is extremely overpriced. It drops in
POG A LOT. Basically if that persons guild is not GIVING them the
spell for free they should join another guild. My guild sold EXTRA pog
spells but gave them to druids who could use also, it only seems fair
when the guild is doing POG where you get no armor instead of kael
where everyone can.

If you are not kos there are a couple good faction raisers/fixers
besides your old boring muffins one, my favorite I believe is quite
large and raises the same ones as the muffin quest. Go to sisters isle
in OOT, bind there in proximity to the styria fearnon hut (the sisters
leader) Lev, sow, etc, run over to those pirates on the
gornit/pirate/seafurbies island and kill sureshot. Get both his
earring and bracer. If he does not drop an earring, get one from
another person there. Gate back and give the bracer to styria for
faction raises, etc. Give the earring to her for them also. I sit
while doing it to build back up the mana from gating back over. Repeat
until your faction gets very good. 

There are some great bonuses to doing this as a druid. 3 times while
doing this on 3 seperate occasions I saw wiltin up out of the corner
of my eye in passing with no one around and snared and killed him to
do the ranger legs quest. Camping the arrows sucks so much though that
I only actually got the legs once and banked another and let another
rot after calling out to the zone and no one responded. I also got the
AC once while doing this since no one else was around and I did the
bracer quest while killing the AC PH's. 4 ph's and the Ac spawned
giving my cleric dark elf level 14 twink jboots.  I also got the
oracle robe doing this twice when he popped.

I never lowered my faction in POG, I just get bored sometimes and do
this while getting the two heads for the ogre war maul quest in
butcher, getting an oracle robe, or whatever.

another fun "two birds with one stone" method of raising it is to go
to the hogcallers inn in west freep where that dwarf muffin guy is,
and instead go and give lanterns you can buy from the guy downstairs
to the ranger in the room by the dwarf for the trueshot quest. He
gives you a stackable wood chip and you can go give the chips to emil
parsini (vendor in toxula) to raise erud merchant faction for yet more
faction fun.
