Well if you only come to the odd raid you certainly end up with less
points and poorer gear than the person on every night which is how it
should be - you also try and ensure that the amount of points gained
by raiding mob x is balanced but the amount spent buying loot - we
had to change one encounter where this was revealed to be a problem
due to NPC in question being triggerable.  On a sidenote as soon as
the points system went into place we stopped recruiting, I don't know
when we will start again as the flood of apps was overwhelming.

People only accumulate lots of points if they never buy any loot, I
fail to see the benefit in this.
