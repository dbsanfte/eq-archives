Hi All

I see they fixed the "extra" two slots "bug" and I am back to 8/8
instead of 9/10   :(    They worked it so that the character with the
name starting with the latest letter in the alphabet is knocked off
your character list.  It reappears when you delete a character you
decide you don't want though.

Just thought I'd mention it to save anyone that "Oh god - they deleted
my mega-character!"  moment   :D
