Last night, a few guildies and I got a group together to go to Skyfire and
kill guardian wurms for spell drops and exp.

We're hanging out near the Rage spawn point.  There are a couple of clerics
there waiting for him to pop.

All we're doing is killing wurms.  We weren't after Rage.

Then one of the clerics sends us a tell on the order of "If you're after
Rage you can't have him because we're on a GM-mandated list".  Huh?

Seems their guild leader had somehow thought that the GM had given him
control of an official Rage list.  Funny thing, though.  There is no mention
of an official GM-sanctioned list anywhere.  There was no mention of a list
on that guild's website.  In fact, there was no mention of a list anywhere
at all.  The funniest thing is that the first few clerics on this list were
all in this one guild, and the next opening on it was months away.

We petitioned, and were told that as far as the GMs were concerned, Rage is
FFA.  If there is a list, it's up to the players to honor it, but nobody is
required to.

This kinda irritated us.  We decide to camp Rage, since he's due to spawn
sometime in the next 12 hours or so.  So more groups of guildies showed up
to kill wurms for exp while waiting.  Next thing you know, we have 18-20
people in zone.  The other guild starts to mass too.  The officers start
getting all kinds of tells from the other guild leader about this fictional
GM list.

Things go on like this for awhile, and I go to bed.

Wake up this morning and pop in to say hi.  We have 18 people in the zone. 
They had 7 or 8, and most of those were AFK.

Then Rage pops.  We killed him.  Took about 60 seconds.

I'm expecting our message board to erupt in flames later.
