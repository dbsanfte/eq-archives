As many other people have said, the speed is exactly the same.
I frequently group with a friend who has Jboots, and can follow
her, or she me, across zones as long as the Karanas without
either of us falling behind.

THe trick with TBoots is to click them frequently.  Whenever
you zone, whenever you get ready to pull or recieve a pull,
whenever someone inspects you... basically a lot.

Why?  Because they do have a duration, and that duration
is bound to run out when you need it not to.  If you have
Jboots on, you can hit them when the icon starts blinking,
since they have no cast time the fact that you are currently
running won't matter.  Tboots, though, you must stop
to activate.  If you needed them on, then you need not
to have to stop!

Worse, if you are a true tank, you will have  no channeling
skill, which means that you won't have any chance of
getting them active while being beat on... you'll still be
ok if its only one mob on you, since the cast time will
let you slip em in between mob bashes, but with a bad
overpull on you, its going to be unlikely at best.
