The top left of any of these screens moves them about. The bottom
right corner is the one to grab and resize the screen. Keep the mouse
in the little box in the very corner when you click to stop resizing
it.

Failing that, deleting the .opt files in the game directory should
reset you back to the defaults (and will kill all your hotkeys and
socials too). Can someone correct me if I am wrong here please.
