    Our warriors, even the ones with much, MUCH better, still want that
Epic. I wish it had never been named that, then maybe they wouldn't want it.

    We're an uberguild, and our minimums for application are 100 in any
given resist with resist gear, level 60, and a desire to raid. We don't care
about gear so much - you'll hit acceptable levels off rots alone once you
join, and we don't feel it's right to ask someone who isn't in an uberguild
or a strong guild already to have gear that's only obtained by membership in
one. It's more about seeing how people react, how they think, and
determining if they'll BECOME top players once they're dressed up in top
gear. And personality. That's critical.

    The player is what we want, not his gear. If we wanted gear we'd buy up
the accounts that get E-Bay'ed every couple of weeks or so from us or the
other "top-tier" guild, the accounts with multiple NToV drops and in some
cases multiple Vulak drops.
