I guess I'm coming from it at the angle that none of my characters have much
in the way of Really Cool gear...and that I'm in a minority.  Chances are
pretty danged good that the SK in my group will already have better gear
than me (comparatively speaking, of course) and that the chances of him
being "gimped" by my refusing to upgrade his Really Cool gear with Really
Really Cool gear are damned near zero.  Why?  'Cause he's already better off
than me.  If I won the thing maybe *I* could get some Really Cool gear.
Sorry, but screw everyone who has better stuff than me when it comes to
pick-up groups...roll for it, baby.  My rolls usually suck anyway.
