Gnolls are good faction farming, I occasionally go in there and buff newbies
a bit, but run around clicking bracer dot on every unengaged gnoll that I
see, which is entertaining when they start running around, and people are
like "who's training all these gnolls and why do they fall over dead and not
give me exp as soon as I hit them?"

Here's your problem sir, level 5's tend to die a lot in Blackburrow.

Wasn't there also the option of zoning like the people that train you
apparently did?  Thus avoiding the fight entirely.

Heh, there's a smart one.  They train you and accuse you of KS.  And KSing a
level 4-6 gnoll at that, the same thing that there's another 50 of within
100 feet, and that respawn within 5 minutes or so.
