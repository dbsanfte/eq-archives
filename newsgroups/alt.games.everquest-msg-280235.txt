It's a convenience for *you* not them. They would be content to cancel 
your account on your next billing cycle if you, for instance, subscribed 
and then removed your credit card information from your account, failing 
to specify it again when your month is up.

See, I just find that completely unnecessary under the circumstances. 
Are you just trying to teach them some kind of lesson or something?

Only when people insist upon making it that way.

That's not exactly their problem.

Technically, they're not charging you for a billing error. They are 
simply charging you the amount agreed upon by both parties for their 
service.

What does trust have to do with it? You owed the money, you've 
authorized them to charge it to your card, and they did it. Just in two 
transactions rather than one.

For the record, this is the first billing "problem" I can ever remember 
having with them.
