I myself just interact with the male and female characters in a
role-playing manner. I don't concern myself with if they are really a
woman on not, after all we are just playing a game and it's not a chat
room. Now I do know some that really are women from playing with them
for so long. But I never ask, that's their prerogative if anyone wants
to play opposite genders.
