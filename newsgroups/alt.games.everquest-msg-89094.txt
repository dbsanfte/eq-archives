Not bad advice at all, if you don't mind picking up strangers all the
time.

One problem with many of the combinations that have been suggested so
far is that, once you hit mid-50's, you will be left with some party
members who won't be considered that desirable for upper level raids
(and before someone replies, I'm taking here about perceived, rather
than actual, usefulness).  Druid is the obvious example.

Warrior, cleric, and bard, on the other hand, makes a group that will
hunt quite well on its own, add members to good effect, and will be
fine at upper levels.  All you're missing really is porting and evac
(the bard can snare and "sow", and supply many enchanter functions).
And believe me, having your own private cleric is _very_ nice.
