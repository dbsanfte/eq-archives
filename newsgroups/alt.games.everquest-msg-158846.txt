I've got a 51 druid and monk and have found the dreadlands losing interest.
I'm thinking maybe city of mist? The icegiants seem perpetually camped.

I had a look at fungus grove, but with harmony nerfed i can't see how to
break camps, and the guards there seem useless. I have all expansions.

The area beside KC was great until 51, and before that the ten. tunnel, and
before that the camp in grim forest, and before highkeep and paw... in all
these places you could either zone or run to guards, your enemies were
mostly not immune to druid spells (snare, root, harmony)... ah that was the
life! In some zones, wolf form didn't even make you kos the guards! what a
concept. Why gorenaire wanders past hordes of monsters to snap up a wolf is
anyones guess, especially as she's amiable otherwise.

What about ocean of tears, or are the seafuries there perpetually camped
too?

I'm on rodcet nife, which is surprisingly busy in a lot of these zones,
except grim forest and ten mountains, and that i suspect is because you are
forced to bring large group/s if you want to break the camps there, or guys
who find coterie are lt blue at best.

I miss the old deathfist camps.
