At least Verant is smart enough to do this.  If I quit and knew that my
chars were deleted, there's no way in hell I'd return to the game and
start from scratch.  It is in their best interest to leave the characters
in the database for as long as possible -- disk space is super cheap and
I can't believe that an EQ character takes more than 50Kb of storage.
