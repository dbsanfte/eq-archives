I really don't mind getting Pk'ed at all. In fact, it adds an amazing element to
the game you don't get on blue servers.  But when you're at the point where you
actually have to pull your phone line out because typing /q takes longer than the
guards need to kill you, EVERY time you spawn, it really does ruin it.  ANd yes, I
will sink to the level of Poxor to get rid of him.  He's a 733t d00d and you can
tell by his mannerisms while speaking in ooc to the zone and his incredible
weakness and fear when not under protection.  And when you catch him away from the
guards, he usually dies and then comes back and raves about how he killed more
people more times than he's ever died.  It really is quite annoying.  I can't invis
myself yet, and my bind spot is Qeynos gate.  If I need to gate away from some
level 35 pk'ers, I don't want to run into a level 13 moron shouting about roxoring
everyone and then getting repeatedly killed by the guards.  It's just too
frustrating at that point.
