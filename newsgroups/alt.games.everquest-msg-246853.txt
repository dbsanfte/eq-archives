To be honest, I have never used anything above the base root spell. it 
is fast, and pretty well hits every time. Currently I am soloing wyverns 
in CS for fun and profit [and aa exp] and in general I can get root to 
tick through a judgement/retribution/judgement and I have enough hp/ac 
to be able to cast root through them hitting me to root them long enough 
for me to finish them off with a final cast of judgement.

A caveat about root crowd control in a group is you do have to know that 
some tanks want to follow a mob on a death crawl becauase they take no 
hits that way, and a rooted mob will continue to hit...
