Yeah some asses are taking advantage of free software and trial to
spam.  Banning account does no good as they can get another free
account and ignore doesn't do good either, they change toon very
often.

There is a way to boot them off temporarily.  There is a minor bug
with chat channel invite: no time out.  If several people were to set
a hot key to spam the offending person with invite 5 times (max in EQ
macro) and all do it at once, a flood of channel invites will kill the
spammer.  If you use MQ2 (and you shouldn't), it may be possible to
make a fast invite spammer.
