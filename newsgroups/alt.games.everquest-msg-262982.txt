In many of the classical cultures, items donated to the temple in 
thanks got displayed, frequently not just items bought 
specifically for a donative[like a molded arm or leg, or ear with 
an inscription carven into it] such as gold laurel leaves won as 
athletic prizes, or tripods won as theatrical prizes in greece 
and rome. As well as in a general way the early and middle 
christian churches also recieved odds and ends as donatives 
ranging from molded body parts, to bits and pieces of saints 
inside incredibly *expensive* gold or silver and gem reliqueries, 
to pieces of armor and items won in tribute.

In general, not even the catholic church likes divesting itself 
of items donated to it...ever seen any of the warehouse lists 
from the vatican museums? OY!
