I'm guessing that the /auctions are from people who only have a few things to
sell and don't want to go to the trouble to set up the /bazaar.  Or they can't
use the new interface, (I can't, and you can't use /bazaar without it).  Last
but not least:  How do you sell containers, i.e., Rallic Packs, Herbalist Bags,
Hand made Backpacks?
