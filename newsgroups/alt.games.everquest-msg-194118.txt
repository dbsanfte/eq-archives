I'm almost 100% certain its not true. Colours are just how pretty
your lizard is, same as the horses, drum size is speed of your
lizard, just like the different bridle types are for horses.

I have the 100k horse... its *not* bard speed, but its faster than
about everything else I can find.

As far as I know the main difference between lizard and horse
is lizard has an annoying 'hop' when it runs (bounce bounce bounce
hope you dont get easily sick...) and the horse has an annoying
head in the way that requires shrinks to avoid.
