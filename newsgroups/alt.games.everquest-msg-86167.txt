And I play in the early morning hours which means I'd just be pissing
away 40 bucks as there is hardly ever a GM on Brell after mid-night
through when I log at 9am PST and I'm willing to bet Legend would be
the same. As a matter of fact I can't recall a single GM event on my
server taking place in the early mornings hours, but I lack the "junky
gene" and am a casual players so maybe they do, but has to be rarely.
