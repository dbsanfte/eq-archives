Hmm.. And by the "red diggers" you mean like "muck digger" and such (type of
creature)?

Down below, like in the caves under the mountain.. (to paludal, and trader
camps and such)?
Hmm.. been down there a lot, but since the *.* Digger is green, i have not
paid any notice to them, and since they was to be named "Cht'Thk" i thought
they were like the rest of the "Cht'Thk" up on the surface..

But i will take a look..
