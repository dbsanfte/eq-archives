I've evac'd without somebody else calling it all of twice playing
Druids to 51 on Stromm and 38 on FV.  I don't like pulling the plug,
much rather have Cleric or Enchanter/Necro or even group leader make
the decision.  Winning a really tough fight is some of the best fun
EQ offers, to me at least, and unless there's no hope at all I'd
rather gut it out to the bitter end, to the point of off-tanking an
add in desperation (well, I was trying to kite it, but it was kinda
tight quarters for that, and I did keep it busy long enough for the
Cleric to land his last CHeal on the Warrior, so the battle was won
and I was rezzed back in soon after).

just my $.02
