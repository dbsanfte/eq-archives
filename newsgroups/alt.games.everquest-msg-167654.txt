Steel Warriors faction is a pain to raise.  I have heard there is a
quest in Halas (gnoll fang?) that is the least painful way to raise
it, but I have no idea how viable that quest would be for a Gnome
Necro.  I suspect that the milk quest you are referring to is the
one in WC that raises Temple of Marr and Hall of Truth factions (NFP
Cleric/Paladin factions), don't think that one raises Steel Warriors
(could be wrong, been a long time).  You need faction about half-way
through amiable for the turn-in to work, seems like an awful lot of
trouble to go to for an item that typicly sells for 50 - 200pp these
days.
