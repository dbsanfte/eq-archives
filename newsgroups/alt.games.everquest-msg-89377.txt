I'm sorry, but a Sword of Legulaz or an Axe of Majlraep (spell it
backwards -- yes, there is such a person) is going to positively
detract from the game as far as I'm concerned.  I certainly wouldn't
want to own one.

The overwhelming majority of the names I see are really pretty bad and
definitely not the stuff of high fantasy.
