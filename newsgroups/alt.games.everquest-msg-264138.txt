I'd say you're right. But this solo/group designation is just one
element. The game misses social mobs imho. Sure when you have this
linked group behaviour in place there is no room for social aggro. Since
the highlighted mobs wouldn't be the only ones to come. Some people
claim to have witnessed social behaviour but I really doubt that. They
probably were to close to an aggro mob and didn't realize it until they
had the pulled and the aggroed mob on them. ;)
