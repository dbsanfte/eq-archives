I have yet to go to Hate B.  I have been on a couple of raids to the
old hate and had alot of fun.
So... what has changed?  As I understand they made hate all one floor
so the GFlux wont send you through the roof aggroing the 2nd floor.

but beyond that, whats the big change? Are there new drops? New
Creatures? new spawn time?  
Anyone have a link to a Review / Guide to the new hate? (figure its
too soon for a guide, but eh some peeps have that kind of time).

Your time and information is appreciated.
