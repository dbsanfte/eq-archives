Ring of Fear might be a bit ugly to attempt for one group of casuals.
Lotsa mobs spawn it it and there's a bit of a timer before more mobs
spawn.  Would be pretty easy to get overrun.

Getting the stuff to spawn the dragon is umm tedious. :)

: Hate's Fury is a neat crawl with fun little drops for twinks.

Yeah, HF is a cool zone.  Make sure the first time you go up on the
Upper decks to take a look at the ocean.  Veng face mask and Arms drop
there, and a monk/bst glowyfist thing too.

*grin* Doing all the 6 PoJ trials is fun.  The only one that is really a
bit pissy is Flame, but that one is really easy to force a fail and get out
of.  No way in Hell would they be able to take on Hammer with 1 group.
Even Meemers thinks that isn't feasible.
