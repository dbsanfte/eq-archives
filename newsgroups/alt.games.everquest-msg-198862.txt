Numb nuts? Feeling a bit insecure, huh? Here's a tip: stop top
posting. What is this newsgroup coming to when people just throw
random insults at people for stating their opinion? 

.. oh wait, it's ALWAYS been like that, though Dark Tyger hasn't been
around for a while.

Of course there is. If they're low level, they have a relatively low
mana pool. KEI will keep their downtime at a minimum. There's one
reason right there.

That's great. You must have missed my original point: Go around
shouting "xx cleric who refuses to get KEI LFG" and you'll get no
response. If you keep it to yourself, of course you'll get a response.
Learn the difference and learn to read, PLEASE.

What's wrong with that, besides being terribly mana ineffiecient? Why
were you in a group with another cleric, anyway? Group only needs one,
this coming from a 55 cleric who is by NO means a twink. I donate, at
MAX, 20pp for KEI each time. That's the standard it seems on Tarew
Marr. If it happens to be inconvenient for the KEI'er, I donate 30. 

When starting a new spellcaster, I ALWAYS hit him or her with KEI
instantly, that way even standing, he NEVER runs out of mana. He can't
even get below 80% for nearly 6 levels. Tell me that's NOT a good
reason to get KEI and I'll sample whatever it is you're smoking.

Of course, as I said, these are my opinions.
