    Wouldn't bother me in the slightest.  In fact, I would applaud it.  I
found it very bothersome to log on for the night, get ready to whip up some
dyes or perhaps start up and LDoN, and immediately see a couple requests in
guild chat to come to wherever and rez a few bodies.  And it has been my
experience that having the ability to cast a buff that so many people
consider desirable means that a sizable percentage of those people will
expect one to cast it upon their demand.
