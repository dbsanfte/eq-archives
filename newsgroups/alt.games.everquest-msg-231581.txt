Lessee:

Used to make only one arrow at a time when fletching.  (I think this
changed just before I started fletching, though.)

Rogues are able to make poisons now; they couldn't when I started.

Backstabs got full aggro even on a total miss.

You could backstab for 1 point of damage.

Sneak / Hide didn't work together for anybody.

Shamans couldn't perform Alchemy.

/consent command allowed you to drag a corpse; it also allowed you to
strip it.  Letting anyone drag your corpse involved a lot more trust
than now.

Kith Forest was safe at night.  (Reasonably safe.)

Minotaur Axes were valuable.

Griffons in EC were scarey.

Going to a new town and settling in (getting a Bind) was an adventure
at low levels.

Travelling all the way across the continent was a real rite of
passage.

Learning to use your mana effectively was necessary, and separated the
good from the mediocre.

3 groups fighting the orcs in HH, all the while screaming KSer at each
other.  (Anybody else notice that the spawn rates for orcs and gnolls
in HH has dropped off dramatically?)

The SBS was valuable, and the cause of much kill-stealing.

D'Vinn was a terror.  (As was Dorn in N Ro and that other rare one in
WC.)

Fear was accessible to 1st level characters.

Quad-kiting?  What's that?

Boat travel was exciting / annoying / an adventure.

You could practically depopulate N Karana by shouting "GrimFeather!".
