For about 120pp, you can buy a key in Paineel (get someone to buy it for
you).  As a 3rd level I got a tell asking for my key to Paineel by someone
wanting to go in the Hole.  I explained the need for a Hole Key (she was
50+) and she asked me to show her where to buy the key.  She gave me 100pp
just for leading her to water.  She figured out how to drink on her own.
