------------------------------

- The Kindle spell scroll was scribing the wrong spell into spell books.
This is now fixed.

- The new "mass" Imbue spells were not deity restricted.  They are now.

- We're also making some minor updates to a couple of zones that were missed
last night.

- We have also fixed a bug that cause the Alt and Shift functions to be
reversed, and restored the functionality (though it was unintentional) of
using the Up Arrow and Enter keys to "autorun".

We're sorry for the downtime, but it should be very brief.

Thanks for playing EverQuest.
