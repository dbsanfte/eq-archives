Hi guys-thanks for all the feedback-just to clarify something regard
sean and remingtons points-it was closer to remingtons point on the
'not much time' angle but I realize that sean's position in very
defencible based on what i wrote-I did not put in all the details as I
was trying keep a long post as short as possible, but for those that
are interested (and there sure have been alot of posts on this :)  -
here goes-to provide more detail on this particular point------we were
just about to go back to lcy, 1 short-I had decided to stay with group
cause 1 of the new peeps was a friend that I had not played with for a
while-the 'jerk was not in the group when I 'decided' to go back, I
told group leader I did not want to play with him and it seemed to me
we would get someone else-then just as we stand up to move down
corridor-the 'jerks' name pops in our group list-as this is happening,
some of the team are crossing moat and starting to fight-I realize I
could have yelled out and quit ect, but I really only had a second to
make the decision-I choose to 'bite the bullet' so to speak, and
play-mostly to be with my friend and also not to desert the group as
it was literally going into battle...and I felt I  could just 'put up'
with the 'jerk'-then the big unexpected battle happened, the 'jerk'
somehow dying quick(honestly not my fault, he wasnt around main
party)-him pestering and whinning about rez and % of said rez during
battle and THEN my temper snaps and i decide to go (after battle)-BUT
with a heads up to group that I'm leaving at end of battle (another
clr was shouting LFG at time, but got snaped up before mine could get
him-they did shout to him)-I heal all my party up when its all over
(all at ent to lcy, way is clear to ent), and only then I gate out and
get into tell battle with jerk ect...  I assure folks I'm not adding
these details to try to 'look' better, the main point remains
unchanged, but i did not abandon my group when they were in harms
way!!-I chose not to rez a party member that died, and I wanted
feedback on my decisions-HEH and did I get it :) -thanks again for
feedback group-   Ironeyes, 52 dwf clr, rathe server EST
