It's strange but the gear I was probably most proud of was a full set
of small bronze that I got with my 9th lvl dwarven cleric within a
month of the Bristlebane server opening. Too broke to even buy my 9th
lvl spells, I took a loan of the godly sum of 10plat from a friend,
put everything else I owned in the bank and did the naked run to
Unrest where the Ubers (anyone above 10th lvl <g>) were selling bronze
cheap so they wouldn't have to bother carrying it back to
civilization. Dodging the goblins in Dagnor's and all the scary trains
in Unrest while playing banker and buying bronze cheap was some of the
most fun I've had in EQ.   

With the current gear, it would have to be my epic. All of it (except
for the tear from Fear) done without the help of my guild, just me and
a few good friends which is how I always thought EQ should have been.
All the other items I have really fond memories of are gifts, Being
given a copy of Malo back when it was worth about 50k (and that was a
lot of money) or, more recently, being given an ornate chain boot
pattern when it easily could have been sold for over 100k. 

... if I ever get it, I'll add that ring from Heili to the list! ;-) 

Rgds, Frank
