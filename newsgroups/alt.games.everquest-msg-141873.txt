Its about time. Shaman and Druids are a priest class
they should have better healing than they have now.

Also, good to have another class besides chanters that
can do decent CC.

I am tired of showing up at raids and having 1 key class
not show up. 'Sorry guys go home raid is not happening
there's no chanter/cleric/warrior.'

My only bitch is Complete Healing is bullshit. But if Clerics
have it, then druids and shaman need close it to substitute
for a cleric when none is around.

Complete Healing should NEVER have been added to the
game, and should be taken out of it and all high level
encounters re-tuned to account for it.
