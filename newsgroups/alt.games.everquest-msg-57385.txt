XML, eh? That's interesting. I wonder why they're bothering?

XML is a good tool for passing data between systems that have no
common 'language' between them. It seems to me, though, that it would
be better to simply stick with a consistent options format (such as
the .ini file) in EQ.

Sounds to me like someone on the EQ programming team was itching to
play with XML.
