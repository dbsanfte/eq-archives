OTOH, I once was in a group with two wizard pets. They nuked, the
higher wizard pulled, I sowed, healed and nuked. (I think we had an
enchanter present for a while). I limited my nuking since theirs were
much more efficient, so when they were getting lom, I had them sit
down and med while I pulled in something I could solo with root
dotting. Hence, exp was to be had by all, even while they had
downtime.

>(average time LFG... 1.5 hours per attempt)

Ugh.
