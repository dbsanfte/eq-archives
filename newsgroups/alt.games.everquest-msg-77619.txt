Depends on the zone. 

In old zones; Most of the time

In expansion cities; never.

In expansion zones; only if I am KOS to almost the entire zone. Case
in point Dawnshroud peaks, there are a few MoB that won't attack me
without wolffrom, but will if I have wolffrom. So I forego it.

My problem lately is how buggy the new wolffrom is. Anybody coming
into the zone or returning from LD say I look like a beastmaster's
level 9 wolf pet (very small). It has even caused some problems when
trying to invite me into a group. I had to recast it for the person
who "zoned in" so I would be normal size.

Please fix the thing verant.
