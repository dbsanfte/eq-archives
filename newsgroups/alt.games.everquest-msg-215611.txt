I like cheese.  Sometimes.  Oh, about your topic?  Well, first of all make
sure to say something to anyone that messes up.  Chances are it isn't
because they are trying to get the group wiped, but many of them haven't
grouped in a dungeon environment before, and simply don't know any better.
After all, in Paludal with all the twinks it doesn't matter if you aggro 20
mobs, right?  So without being a dick, just point out the error they made
(try not to point fingers, just use general terms) and teach 'em a good
lesson.

I have grouped with several folks in LDoN that haven't grouped with an
enchanter before.  You can tell by their gameplay, breaking mezzes, putting
DOTs on adds, jumping on the first thing that comes into camp regardless of
incoming message (hey ass-clown, we need to take down that caster first,
wait till he gets to camp!).  These folks are in their 40s, up to 50.  I
always try to educate them first, but if someone consistently breaks mez
after I have pointed out the mechanics of it then I start to get pissed.  I
TELL THEM IN ALL FUCKING CAPS NOT TO BREAK MY FUCKING MEZ AGAIN!  Overall,
however, my grouping experiences in LDoN seem to be the opposite of yours.
Most folks I have grouped with have been skilled players and I've gone 9 and
2 so far (2 losses were both collections in Rujarkian Hills, I think they
might look at drop rates there).

About the AFK people... well, not much to do there except the options you
listed.

Send a tell to Ozzlar, I can always use another cleric pal.  Free C for you!
