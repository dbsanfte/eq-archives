One thing you can try is to get the cleric beating on the MOB while
the pally chain stuns, kneeling between casts.  (Kneel to avoid
riposts, at least if he has that skill at his level).  The MOB will
attack the Pally because he is aggroing it with those stuns, but the
Cleric will do the damage.  And just like Kosh wrote, finish it off
when it is clearly below 50 percent.  (Just remember that the cleric
has to do most of the damage, and if you pick up a damage shield, that
damage isn't assigned to anyone.)

When your cleric is around level 18 (assuming the Pally hasn't
leveled) they can start grouping.  The formula is 'about':

(Highest player level) * (0.75) must be equal to or less than lowest
player level.  However it seems to round up, so test the waters around
18.
