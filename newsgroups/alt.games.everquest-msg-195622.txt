Thank you all for your advice and suggestions.  I think I will either
hold back entirely, or use more of any monies I accept for spells and
some smaller items, maybe normal armor and weapons instead of magic
(chain or leather or plate, depending on character).  Or possibly some
simple weapons and/or regen items.  It's all been such great advice!

Again, you have all been great, thank you so much!
