There are 3 types of chests.

Mechanical - requires detect traps, disarm traps, pick locks to open them
Cursed - Requires a wisdom caster with 3 LDoN bought spells to detect, 
disarm, and open.
Magic - Requires an int caster with 3 LDoN bought spells to detect, 
disarm, and open.

Alternatively, you can take your chances, and beat them open.

As for how worthwhile they are?  I have only seen something decent come 
out of a chest 3 or so times out of 50ish or so chests opened.  I 
generally don't bother with them, although I did purchase the wisdom 
caster spells for them early on.

Oh, to use some of the spells for the chests, you have to buy scrying 
stones from the magus at a wayfarer camp too.
