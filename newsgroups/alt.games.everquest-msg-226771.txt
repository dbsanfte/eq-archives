It could be they're trying to see if you really do have a group together.
It's feast or famine for me as an Enchanter, and on the feast nights, I
often get offers saying, "Want to join our group?" and it winds up being
some Beastlord who has no interest in recruiting but doesn't bother to tell
me that until we've sat there for 20 minutes while he said he was
recruiting, and--

Anyway.  Ahem.

On feast nights, first thing I ask is, "Where you hunting?"  If someone's in
a dungeon where I need points, they're more likely to get me.  If I know I'm
short on time, I'll say, "How many people are in the group already?"  If
they say, "You, with another one the way," I'll go with someone who's more
ready.  I've turned down too many offers only to find out that our "good
group" is one Beastlord who's friend is gonna sign his monk on, so we sit in
North Ro waiting on them, and the Beastlord says they're recruiting, but
then I find out they've been watching a DVD instead, so then *I* wind up
recruiting (which I don't mind, but don't waste time first), and then the
Monk shows up but says he's watching his sister while his folks are out, and
by that time the Ranger has to go because his mom said so, so we fill his
spot with a necro who's watching the baby, and THEN the leader has to go AFK
for dinner, but he neglects to tell you they have to cross campus to eat and
want to pick up cigs on the way home, so we think they're going to be 5-10
minutes and sit there, and--

Uh...  Anyway.

Where was I?
