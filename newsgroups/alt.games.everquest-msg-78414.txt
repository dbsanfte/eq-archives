You know... just last night I was talking to a friend about this....
Id love to Prune down my log file.  I dont look back at them, I just
use them for Pasketti's parser.  
It would certainly reduce in size by just removing all the /ooc, /auc,
and /shout  (so much spam in there).

Great Work Pasketti.!!!!!
