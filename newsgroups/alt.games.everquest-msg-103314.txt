I would disagree with that, although, personally, I do not use OOC for said
purpose.  I only use OOC for things that I feel will really be of possible
interest, or at least should be communicated to, the zone as a whole.  I do
feel it is called OOC for a reason, and that any and all OOC communication
is valid in said channel so long as it does not violate the language rules.
If I want to say hi to my buddy or buddies, I send them a tell.  If I want
to get into a general discussion about something that may not even be EQ
related, I would use OOC.  Actually, now I would probably suggest creating a
channel for it, but that is only a recent option.
