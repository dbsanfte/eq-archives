I disagree.

This is what Sanjian wrote;

"How many students know they're taking a 10% risk
of being infected if they're sleeping with an
infected person?"

This is what Limbaugh said;

"The condom failure rate can be as high as 20
percent. Would you get on a plane -- or put your
children on a plane -- if one of five passengers
would be killed on the flight? Well, the statistic
holds for condoms, folks." 

Totally unjustifiable bullshit. 

"The theatres on fire, folks"

Its an important word to leave out. Its not like
he left out an apostrophe. And, it was
deliberately missed out.

Have you heard of the "Wicked Bible"? 

A print of the King James version contained the
following "Thou shalt commit adultery"

Perhaps he should have said in his defence;
"So I left out the word "not". So sue me."

The printer was fined 300 pounds.

The problem I have here is not that there is no
sex education,... I could understand that, but
that, a teacher handling sex education is giving
out basic information that is wrong, and that
no-one in that class, school, or parental circles,
ever questions it.

I can't imagine how anyone, especially an
adolescent youth, with the quality control they
tend to give condoms, as a solo pastime, could
believe that it is impossible for a condom to ever
break. Or heard that apocryphal joke about the
vengeful bastard with a pin, inside the condom
factory.

If you say it happened, it happened, but to me, it
would be like a music teacher telling their pupils
that all violins have six strings.

Yes, you are correct, but that wasn't entirely
obvious when you were comparing the Limbaugh
figure of 20% and Sanjian's figure of 10%, and
ended with the conlusion;

"So that would be... 15%?"

This crafty conflation between the failure rates
of condoms, and the likelihood of being infected,
is at the heart of the dishonesty shown by both
Limbaugh and Sanjian.

>I suspect I read what I 
>thought Sanjian meant, rather than what he wrote.

I think you missed out both on what he meant, and
what he wrote.

What he wrote was a lie, and what he meant was to
scare uninformed, naive people into Church
sanctioned sexual practices. 

A subject where their  track record of hypocrisy
is almost as boundless as their lust for wealth.
