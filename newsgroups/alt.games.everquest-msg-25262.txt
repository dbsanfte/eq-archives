Are you sure you're not talking about the Polished Mithril Torque from King
Trannix?

It's AC 7, 13 Wis and Int, No Drop, NECK slot.  And when they said "tank"
classes, they didn't mean "plate" classes - it's wearable by Paladins,
Rangers, Shadowknights, Monks, Bards, Warriors and Rogues.  Don't sweat it,
you couldn't have worn it anyway.
