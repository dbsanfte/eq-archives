Would that be routers or NAT boxes with poorly implemented NAT engines?  
No real IP router should cause ANY problem with online gaming.  I go 
through 19 routers on my way to the EQ server, and everything works fine.  
A router is going to be better than a modem if for no other reason that 
you don't have nearly as much delay.  (A modem adds about 150ms delay just 
in the process of converting digital to analog and putting it on the 
line.)

Routers are dirt cheap now.  You can get a decent one with a firewall and 
passable NAT engine for well under $100.  If you do notice problems, check 
to ensure that you have enabled NAT correctly, and that you have the 
latest firmware.  (My Kentrox Pacesetter works fine with one NAT setting, 
not at all with another, and it's not important enough for me to fix.)
