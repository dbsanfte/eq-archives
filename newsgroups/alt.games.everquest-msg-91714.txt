No, I did not.

I was careful to use qualifiers that clearly indicated that
I was not attempting to characterize *all* posts a certain
way (like "majority"), and I specifically acknowledged
that there were some posts like you described.

You, on the other hand, simply announced without any
qualifiers whatsoever that the posts I was talking about
"were titled" with the words "lie" or liar" in the title.
As a rule, they were not.

Learn the difference.
