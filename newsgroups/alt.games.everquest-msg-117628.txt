Cleric gem racket? Ugh, sounds like your'e another one of these people who
expect the cleric to pay for all the peridots out of their own money, and
argue about it. I enjoyed playing it up to 51, and then it totally sucked
because of people like that (you?). Oh well, playing a chanter now, and I
dont have to argue with everyone about loot now. (Maybe im meant to enjoy
the arguments and I am strange?)
