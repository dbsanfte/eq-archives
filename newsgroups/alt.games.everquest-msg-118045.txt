    Drops in Ssra off the Elites. That's the raw item you turn into a
Shissarbane weapon. Since a guild tends to get a ton of weapons while
camping their Emperor key, and gets almost no ore from camping the mines,
there's usually a bunch of extra weapons to hand out to twinks, etc. Glad to
hear it looks cool - should help me get some nice cash for the one my sales
mule is selling.
