The shaman in the barbarian town (total blank out...cant remember) have a
quest to get an amulet that summons a magic hammer and and is a light
source...it has infinite charges. The quest involves going to Qeynos, but
with PoP you dont have to go through Blackburrow any more, making this quest
really easy...
