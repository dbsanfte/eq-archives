It's two different people and we have absolutely no qualm in what
class we play but we're deadset on at least an Ogre (friend) and a
Human (myself) race, and a feign puller. That's why you see at least a
combination of those in the duos I listed. :)

I'm probably going to go with Human SK and Ogre Bst combination. The
Beastlord and his pet should be able to tank adequate enough if I ever
need to waste time getting rid of agro when I feign pull. That's about
the only worry I have. The other is that I have that annoying urge to
dual-wield. :) In addition, like you said, since we're all not
starting out with jboots or travel boots, that SoW is going to be a
necessity.
