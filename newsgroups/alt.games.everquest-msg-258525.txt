    Ok, as a ranger you get some of the general melee DPS-related stuff like
Greater Sinister Strikes and Veteran's Wrath. Here's your class-specific
list:

Ability: Nature's Bounty
Description: This ability gives you an innate chance to forage more than one
item at a time. Additional ranks increase the chance to forage a second
item.

Ability: Efficiency of the Hunter
Description: Each rank in this ability further increases the accuracy of
your melee attacks.

Ability: Guardian of the Glade
Description: This ability transforms you into an exceptionally bloodthirsty
wolf that attacks with lightning speed for a brief time. The transition into
the wolf will also cause many of your wounds to heal.

Ability: Tracking Mastery
Description: Each rank in this ability increases the maximum you can
increase your tracking skill by 20 points.

    Tracking Mastery and Nature's Bounty sound lame for most people, but
Efficiency of the Hunter and Guardian of the Glade don't sound cool to you?
I know there's no bow-related DPS enhancers, and that kinda stinks, but
there's a ton of melee DPS stuff in there.

    James
