All melee skills can go up from light blues, it's just rare.  Pickpocket and
Instil Doubt can be raised on extremely green mobs.  Heck, Instill
Doubt can be raised on PC's, it just won't fear 'em.  But you still get the
increases.  Disarm can also be raised on any critter holding a weapon.
My favorite way to practice that was to see a goblin in the Misty Thicket
that was about 40 levels green.  Give him a rusty 2hs weapon, and then
Disarm.  It aggros them, but they can't hurt you.  Practice disarm every
time it refreshes until you do disarm him or simply riposte him to death
by accident.  Then either pick up the weapon or loot it, and hand it to
the next one.  Repeat as goblins spawn :-).

Why 2hs weapon? They hit slower,which is a less chance of me
riposting his head off :-P
