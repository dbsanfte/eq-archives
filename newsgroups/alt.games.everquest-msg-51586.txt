Ok, here it is.

I prefer solo to groups, though I am willing to do whatever it takes to get
by.

I've been in Unrest for so long that I have almost gone blind. Also lvl 26
is not that great a level there. Everything in the yard and first floor
(except Torklar himself) is green. When you go to the second floor, it is
TOO hard alone. I'm sort of between hunting capacities there.

So I left and went back to Oasis where I had hunted gators some levels
earlier. Everything there except DW Crocs are green, except again SG and
Spectres which are TOO hard.

Was looking to get to Southern Plains of Karana. Currently standing at the
Innothule Swamp (not a pretty place BTW). As I looked at EQ Atlas, I'm
thinking where the hell can I bind? The Arena I suppose. I will be KOS as a
Dwarf Paladin in the ogre/troll/dark elf areas, right?

Quite candidly, I don't even know what to look for (like armor, rings, etc.)
in these areas - just XP hunting now.

Anyone out there able to develop a AAA map / plan for the next few weeks of
my journey?

Lost.
