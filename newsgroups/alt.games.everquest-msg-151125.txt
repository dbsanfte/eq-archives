    Question: could it have healed the target for more? The heal messages
were broken for a little while and were showing the max possible heal,
rather than what was actually healed. Could it be that the target (which I
assume was you) only had 1729 damage? If that's not the case, it sounds like
petition, bug and feedback time.
