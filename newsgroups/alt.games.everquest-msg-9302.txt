I have a lvl 20 mage, tho my main is a Wizzy.  I'd have to say hands
down the best 3 partners a mage could have would be druid, shammy, or
necro.  Take either one of those three to a place where a mage can
solo on their own and you can get more than double the pace of kills
really racking up exp.

Druids have snare, heal, buffs
Shammys have heal, slow, buffs, pets later
Necros have pets, blindness, snare (of sorts) and dots.  Fear kiting
with a necro AND mage pet kicks ass.  

Paladin wouldnt be in the top 6-8 for a mage partner imo....
