I have a summoner (16) who's gear is all yellow, has an adept 1 pet, and yet
seems to be far less effective than a simlarly equipped fighter type
(especially against groups) and to a lesser extent, my shaman. My spells are
at least app 4. What gives? Is this normal?  I like my summoner but he seems
underpowered.
