>>> I agree, this is absolutely disgusting, and I intend to send Verant an
invoice for the exact amount of my monthly subscription charge that has been
lost due to the downtime today. <<<

Since you sound like your new here, I'll help you with the math.

$12.95 per month. Going to round off a month to 30 days, for ease of math.

Now, the scheduled downtime was 3 hours, but I'm going to be generous and
give you the whole day.

$12.95 / 30 =  $0.43

We'll get your check in the mail first thing tomorrow morning. Make sure to
wait by your mailbox for it.
