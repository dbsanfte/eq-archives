There apparently is no way to do it.

This crops up during server splits too. Your factions are reset to default
if you do the /movelog thing to change servers. A major PITA for anyone who
has done a lot of work to faction up a city they are normally KOS in (like
evils in freeport, or any non-iksar in cabilis). Verant has repeatedly
stated that there is nothing they can do about it.
