Breaking from the Zonein has always lead to wipes in my experience

In my old PoF/PoH days, rogues and monks would portup first as scouts, then
we would have everybody port up (few groups at a time) and run to the SS
(safe side) then camp out.. melees etc would protect clerics to get them
safely camped out

As long as somebody doesn't screw up, theres only what.. 2 mobs on the wall
that can agro you (a spec and a rat)

Monks and rogues then pull all corpses to the SS, the raid logs back in, rez
up.. and start killing.
