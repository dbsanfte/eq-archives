Most likely only paladins and non large race Shadowknights will want this.
Post 55, a warrior (and ranger?) can do stun kick, whether using 1 handed or 2
handed weapons.  Sure you would get the advantage of the higher bash cap than
the kick cap, but since it's only with 2 handed weapons, I couldn't see
spending a full post 50 level on it.  Not when there are tons of more useful
skills in that list.
