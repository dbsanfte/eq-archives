I've tried playing DAoC. I tried for more than a month. I *hate* that game.
I can't even tell you all the reasons I hated it, not that it would make any
difference... I just hated it. My ex even bought it for me, so all I had to
do was pay the 12.95 a month... but he wasted his $$, cause this game sucks,
I've played EQ for almost as long as it's been out, and I have NEVER had the
will to say that it sucks. HE likes it, for whatever reason, but I HATE it,
Yes, I cancelled the account.

Sorry, just my 2 cp.
