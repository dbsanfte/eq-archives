Yeah, but that's really more crowd control than avoiding the crowd in the
first place, since you end up with agro on both of them anyways, just more
controlled on the rooted one.  I do the same thing with snare and root,
works great for breaking up the werewolf camp in PoN (if you've been there,
you'll know what I'm talking about) I can get the first wolf pulled single,
which is good for getting him charmed and positioned, then I can grab a
second one single, then I can get a pair, which is ok, but any further
pulling and I'll get 4+ werewolves (they're higher density towards the rear
of the camp), with that many, I run around and get them all snared, then
root most of them, then set the pet to systematically slaughtering them all.

Oh, and it really pisses groups in the area off that I can kill faster than
them.
