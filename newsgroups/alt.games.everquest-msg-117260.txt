Often find myself tanking and because of dual wield find my self taking a
slap because the mosre you hit the more agro you will get!
So yes i use %t all the time for pulls and such like, also use it when i
snare and fear a target, this is warn anyone not to root the mob because it
will break fear.

You cant tank with a necro personally, you have to use a pet, if you want to
play a necro bring a chair with you, you will be doing a lot of sitting down
and cheering your pet along.
