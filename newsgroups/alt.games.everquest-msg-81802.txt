As everyone can see, Bizbee, unlike others who have an agreeing view of the
"name police", seems to rant on about name calling, uses profanity laced
comments and is just dying to tell us that he is always right.  

In every post Bizbee does on this NG, he acts like a little 12 year old child,
uses continuous profanity and resorts to name calling.  No matter whether or
not someone is trying to make a legitimate point, if Bizbee disagrees with it,
he will turn into the "spoiled little child ranting".   Then he actually has
the nuts to call the people he is disagreeing with a child.  This guy is the
biggest loser I have ever known to troll this newsgroup.  He must never play EQ
since he responds to virtually every post with the same  idiotic drivel and
profane responses.  He has not once posted any useful information that anyone
actually playing EQ could use.  He, most likely, has several "aliases" because
in most cases there seems to be a follow-up post by someone different saying
the same thing, but no profanity

Maybe it is you who should grow up, Bizbee.  Maybe take a chill-pill and
realize that the world does not have to conform to your views each and every
time and if you don't agree, post a civilized response and let the rest of the
group decide instead of going into a four letter parade.  The only people you
will impress with the profanity laced responses are the 12-year olds you claim
everyone else is.  Heck, try making one, non-profane, non-insulting reply to
anything, you might actually find you will get more respect in this newsgroup.

/awaiting next profane laced response from Bizbee
