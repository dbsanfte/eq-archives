I've heard people say that they have made it, but I've never seen it done.

Well, IIRC, the only hex wandering near the entrance would go to the East
wing exit, and stand on the little ledge before the dropoff.    I have no
idea if he could be safely pulled from there or if he would run through the
entire south wing and gather every friend along the way.  I don't think
we've ever put it to the test.  I suppose it's pretty likely he would just
warp to you, but it's still a risk.

Once you get on top though, if you do levitate up there... your first fight
will be pulling from a small room with 4 mobs.   Very very hard to single
pull at 60.   You have to crowd into the back of the little fighting area
too, so you'll probably also aggro the Mortiforus golem on the other side of
the one way wall.

We always came up the passage from south, but a few times we got seven mobs
at once there.   The two in front of the door and the wanderer, and all 4
from the room added during the fight.  (the two in front at least will be
dead before you levitate up there.)

If they would just up the level and capabilities of the mobs so you can hunt
there at 65 again, that would be great with me.   It was always one of my
two favorite zones, and it was a sad day when PoP came out and I could no
longer go there for good experience.

They have a pretty good chance of not screwing it up if they don't change
the mobs, just thier levels and such.  Which seems very possible to me.
