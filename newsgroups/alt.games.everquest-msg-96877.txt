I'm no expert, but I don't think there is any factioning per se.   What I
have noticed is that by not killing the kodiaks and wolves in someplace like
West Commons is that they don't attack me, even when I med.  But if I ever
kill the first one, I've got them all crawling all over me.  I'm only going
on what I've seen with my own ranger.  Surefall/Qeynos Hills is the only
place I know of personally that can get you killed for killing the wolves
and bears.
