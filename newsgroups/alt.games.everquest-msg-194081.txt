You put that much more succinctly than I did.

Excellent point I missed, if you go over 6 points while still waiting for
Vox/Naggy killing, you don't have to spend them until you've saved 30 unspent
points.  First six you have to put into first tier AAs if you want archetype and
class ones... heck, I'd be tempted to get run 3 and then save all the rest for
post 60 AA's if you can level up fast, thats how worthless the first tier AAs
are.
