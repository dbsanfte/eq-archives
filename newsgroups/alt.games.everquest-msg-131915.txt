Chanters and shammy in this case. The staff you are thinking of is the
Staff of Temperate Flux. (Perhaps one of the most incredibly useful
items you can get for a wizard at such a low level.) Sadly, I have never
had the stick's effect land on any dragon, old world or Kunark. To date,
I have tried it on Vox, Naggy, Talendor, Ragefire, and Fay. Always got
resisted. 

I leavet he debuffing up to the big guns. Not that my stick would do
much anyway. I mean, SoTF lowers their heat and cold resist by... what?
Five?
