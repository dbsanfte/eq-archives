I will often walk up to a ranger in full IVY if I am in need of a Sow
then hail them. I then send a tell standing right there
/ttell Can I please trouble you for a SoW?

If they say no, I say "Thank you".
If they cast SoW, I say "Thank you".

I send a tell because I am avoiding a rush of the "me too" crowd. 

I use Please and Thank you. I say thank you even if refused. I don't
ask why. If someone offers me a good service, like a free TL or a REZ
I ask "Can I offer you anything?" They often refuse.
