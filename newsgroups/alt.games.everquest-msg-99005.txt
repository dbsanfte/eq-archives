Ummm....I saw several system-wide messages stating that they do indeed know
of the broken bard status.  My main is a bard and I used him last night
without a hitch, but didn't give all my songs a run-through.  I honestly
don't know what is broken myself, but I'm sure if I try to solo right now
I'll find out!
