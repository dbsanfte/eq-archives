Maybe it's just a bug with my system, but with EQWindows, I can tab off the
screen and use my mouse to do other things while the game is loading - after
server selection, after character selection, and while zoning.

Without, my mouse freezes up during the load period.  I can still tab away,
but I cannot navigate with the mouse... only keys.  (The mouse will not
release, regardless of the Ctrl-R, Alt-Ctrl-R, etc combinations and timing)

Also, the game conflicts and freezes system if I have any streaming audio
running during the loads after server selection and after character
selection.  None of these things occur with EQWindows.

EQWindows also managed font-sizing better.  If I run EQ in windowed mode,
the font's are slightly jaggy - not the case in full mode, or in EQW...

-Just my observations.
