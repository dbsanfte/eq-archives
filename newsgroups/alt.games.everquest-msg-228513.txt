2x xp modifier is not nearly enough.  First, no one likes dieing to LD and
this will make it 100x worse.  Secondly, most content has a risk of death.
Most content also has a balanced risk vs reward.  With permadeath you have
just unbalanced every single encounter's risk vs reward.  I think this
server will be 99% L5 noob gangbangers.
