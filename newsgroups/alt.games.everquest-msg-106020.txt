You can use track for this too.  Though in my experience in Western Wastes 
it was more track until I'm above the dragon, have him AOE me, then get 
chomped into little squishy bits.

Hmmm, so if using ShowEQ and something cool spawns, a nice looping path to 
it is needed, check.  I think being a bard gives me a lot more leeway, 
though not as much as Rangers, since our track has a range of at 3 feet.
