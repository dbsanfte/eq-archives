HoH is probably your best bet.  The other possibility would be BoT 
courtyard, but, given that for your duoing, you will mostly be wanting to 
snare kite, DoT, and nuke, that is probably a bad place for it, not a lot 
of manuevering space.  HoH graveyard has lots of manuevering space, and 
plentiful mobs to pull, although getting singles could be interesting 
without a lull/harmony/pacify capable class, at least until the spawns are 
broken.
