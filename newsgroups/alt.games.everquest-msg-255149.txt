Heheh.  I remember an inner group in PoV with a 
doesn't-quite-speak-english paladin who came to tank for us.  He'd just 
gotten a horse (not sure if it was an AA horse or not, I hear it was the 
Impressive White Charger variety though (I had his race model off))  And 
he insisted on trying to tank while on horseback.  Which meant, of course 
that he couldn't hold aggro to save his life.  Or rather, mine. :)  He 
seemed like a nice guy, but we just couldn't get past the language barrier 
to explain, 'you suck tanking on horseback! Aaah!'
