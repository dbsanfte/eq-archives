If you like the site, and you find it useful, why not subscribe? SOMEONE is
paying for the bandwidth and storage space. The subscription price is very
reasonable. If you sign up monthly it's only $3.45, if you pay a year in
advance you end up spending only a little over $2.00 per month. I do not
object to paying a reasonable price for something I use.

Life is complex, meaning some of it is real, and some of it is imaginary.
