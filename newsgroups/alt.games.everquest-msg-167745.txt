This is two different effects.

One, some NPCs really do see thru some FD, particularly a problem when the mobs
are close to or higher in level than the monk.  This starts around level 30
IIRC, I remember my monk partner petitioning and discussing this with a GM, who
explained that its broken as intended.

Two, casters who have started casting a spell on a non-FD monk continue casting
(apparantly they never heard of ducking out of a spell to save mana) after she
drops, and when the spell lands, this breaks the FD effect

In both cases, landing a spell on a monk who is FD according to skill, but not
according to the mob, works just like landing one on a non-FD monk.  You STILL
get the love.  An experienced monk knows whether he still has active aggro or
not, best advice is to make sure your monk knows the difference, and have a firm
"heal on demand" policy.

This policy is so important that in many raids, I ask to be assigned as monk
healer, noone else is ever allowed to heal the monk for any reason, and I only
ever heal her on demand.  You'd be amazed at how much better this works.  Of
course it does result in the occaisional death of a monk, but thats part of the
job; you may have to die when you could have lived, on occaision, to prevent, on
other occaisions, the deaths of everyone in your raid.

The Remedy line (Remedy, Ethereal Remedy, Supernal Remedy... NOT Celestial
Remedy, oddly, a HOT) is tailor made for monk healing, by the way, although its
not large, its fast and has an extraordinarily long range.  Get an extended
range item for even better effect here; the idea is to be able to heal the FD'd
mob while yourself staying as far as possible from aggro range of any mobs.
Efficiency isn't really an issue.
