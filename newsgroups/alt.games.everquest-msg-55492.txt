My only experience of these events was buffing seven shades of crap out
of newbies in Qeynos Hills while I ferried folk to a vox hunt... I made
them praise Tunare in the most imaginative ways they could, while not
telling them who I wanted praised.

The best one was a guy who stuck at it for 8 minutes or so before suddenly
going "Ooooooh, I get it! Tunares freaking neat!"

heh ;) He gottalottabuffs ;)

But... Someone killed Varsoon and the zone went back to normal. Seems to me
complaining about this is a bit absurd. The zone respawns, and, well, the
reason (uber overlord) or (uber quest) is there is so folks can have fun
doing it. Its not like its the sleeper and over for all time....

Yeah. In the time I was in Qeynos I was dissapointed not to see *any*
plot hints or story development. Seemed to just be "spawn crap loads
of undead, wait for varsoon to die" as usual... ;(
