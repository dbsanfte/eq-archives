Wait until you hit a level where you -must- research a spell.  The longer
you wait the better, as that first point you put in buys skill at your
current level.  Now spend skill points till you hit your level max.

Every time you level, put all five points in to research, unless there
is something vital you need to train.  For casters, there are very
few skills indeed worth more than one point expenditure, so you should
only have a few levels where you can't save all five.

Practicing Research via real components is time consuming and/or
expensive.  Practice via the concordance is... just as time consuming
and/or expensive, if not more so.

If you follow Dan's and my advise, you'll never have to practice
at all, and you'll never be trying an attempt to get a spell you need,
using up valuable and rare components, at less than your personal
best chance for success.

Course having a higher level try it, with his higher skill, is an even better
chance of success... but that assumes he did as you didn't, and thats
not a viable solution long term, if everyone thought that way noone
would have the skill at all!
