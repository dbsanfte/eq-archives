I'm not convinced of the cause and effect of how fast the 2nd attempt was.
On all 3 of my computers I ended up getting pissed at waiting for the
patcher on my first attempt, so I did alt-ctrl-del and ended the task.  I
went back to the patcher and on 2 of the machines things went a hell of a
lot faster.  On the 3rd machine I lost patience and rebooted the sucker, and
the third time patching was the charm.

I've heard similar stories from friends...makes me feel sorry for folks who
don't know a lot about computers...at least enough to know what alt-ctrl-del
is for (there's lots of 'em playing EQ).  SOMETHING appears to be buggy as
hell in their coding.
