I sincerely doubt they can reduce agro on themselves like a rogue.  A rogue
with 200 in sneak and hide and the Escape AA ability will be instanenously
removed from a baddy's hate list.  The same rogue with the Shroud of Stealth
AA ability can walk up to Cazic Thule himself and not get agro.  Standard
issue rogue evade (stop attacking, sneak, hide) will work on most mobs
through tier 2, and a good number in tier 3 PoP zones.

Paladins on the Drinal server are agro machines.  I've only once pulled agro
off a paladin, and only had it for a moment.  Most warriors tend to do a
very decent job of this too, though I've out-agroed warriors more times than
I care to remember.  The rare SK can hold agro where I've played.
