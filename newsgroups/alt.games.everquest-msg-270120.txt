Surely not.

That would be suggesting a Ranger-Blacksmith, Wizard-Blacksmith, Cleric-
Blacksmith would all be significantly different "Blacksmith" 
experiences?

Just how many blacksmiths would I have to level up before I got a feel 
for what being a 'blacksmith' is? 

I think a player should be able to try all the adventure classes and all 
the artisan classes, but arguing that they need to try every combination 
thereof is ridiculous.

If I didn't like the blacksmith part of my Ranger Blacksmith, I probably 
won't like the blacksmith part of my Warrior Blacksmith, Cleric 
Blacksmith, Mage Blacksmith, Enchanter Blacksmith, Wizard Blacksmith, 
and Shaman Blacksmith, etc either.
