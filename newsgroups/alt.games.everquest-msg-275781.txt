Nah, go for it. They're fun to play, and easy to solo. I'd pick a bard 
over a warrior for a first character -any- day.

So learn the quirks. And they aren't -that- complicated. 

Step 1: Get J/T boots or Sow Potions (Don't want to waste a song singing 
selos (run speed)... plus selo's is almost too fast for easy kiting :)

Step 2: Get a drum. For the bard on a budget the combine drums sold in 
Katta Castellum are cheap and adequate.

Step 3: Find a mob

Step 4:
 
snare, Dot, Dot, Dot, Dot
snare, Dot, Dot, Dot, Dot
snare, Dot, Dot, Dot, Dot
...

You can do that all the to the end if you want.

Or you can mix it up with swarm kiting, but you'll really want a few 
points of flowing thought, and ideally a gazughi ring to make that go 
smoothly...

Then its:

charm a mob, send it into a few other mobs (or a dozen other mobs), let 
them shred your pet, when your pet is very low, invis (by song, or for 
more precise timing use a gazughi ring), and fire a dot or two at the 
former pet to finish it off... select new target and repeat

Its really not that hard.

And if all you do is solo you are missing out... Bards are fabulous 
additions to most groups. Sadly they are fairly rare, and rarer still is 
a good grouping bard. Its so easy to solo, that's all most know how to 
do.
