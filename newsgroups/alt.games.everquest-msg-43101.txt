Just to offer a different opinion, I prefer single target mezzes myself,
and only resort to AE mezz in extreme circumstances. The advantages of
using Enthrall, as I see it, are:

1) time. There's just no comparing the duration of AE mezz and
Enthrall/Entrance etc. If you have to continually cast AE mezz, you
don't have much time to do anything else. Once you get a crowd under
control with a long lasting mezz, you can med up some, or turn your
attention to something else. I keep a clock with a second hand on it
above my monitor for mezz timing.

2) no accidentally mezzing yourself if you're in a cramped area, like a
dungeon.

3) resists. I'm sorry, but a pet is the last thing you want to deal with
a mob that has resisted your mezz. Now you can't remezz the critter
until your pet is dead. Much worse things can happen, such as the
animation will get swiped by more than one target; if it survives
fighting the first one, it will immediately attack the next one;
basically, you've lost control of the crowd of mobs, which is the
opposite of your job there. 

Plus, when you are single target mezzing, if you get a resist, you only
have one target to worry about. Flux, back up, mezz and you're fine. Let
the other mobs still not mezzed keep whacking the tanks until you mezz
them, they can take getting hit my multi mobs better than the enchanter.

Mana efficiency is not too much of an issue, usually. Mezzes, and
especially enchanter stuns, are not too mana intensive. Actually, I find
the situations in which I end up chain casting AE mezz to be the times I
run out of mana.

But this is not to suggest AE mezz is useless, far from it. If we are in
a dungeon on a serious crawl, I keep em both memmed.

On the subject of macros, I only have the 2 the original poster
mentioned. And one of those, the "mezzing %t" one, is a fairly recent
addition (we didn't use to have that ability). For targetting, you have
to learn how to become a master clicker and picker of targets. This
usually involves a lot of moving around and re-positioning. There is
currently no other way to do it (ie, repeated presses of F8 does not
cycle through targets). 

Something to keep in mind is that you need to be able to describe or
point out targets without reliance on just a macro. If you have 4
"Sarnak Recruits" or whatever, using %t to describe one is next to
useless.
