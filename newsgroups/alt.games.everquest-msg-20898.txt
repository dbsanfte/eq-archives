Being a cleric desperately in need of +WIS items, I did some research and
decided that an Aegis of Life should *just* be within my reach as a 34
cleric.  So I went to the undead ruins in SK and logged, planning to try
camping Lord Grimrot the next day.

So the next day comes.  I log on and look at the undead.  I have just enough
time to notice that the placeholder is up (yay!) when I get a "Hail,
Monual".

I turn around and there's someone in wolf form.  I give him a "Hail."  Then
I ask, "Are you camping Lord Grimrot?"

"Yes" is the answer, to my deep disappointment.

Ah well, me thinks to meself, I'll stay around and watch, perhaps get a few
pointers for myself.  "Do you want any help taking him down?"

No reply.  I do a /whotarget, and find out that Wolfform is a 56 druid.  As
in, not likely does he need my help.

Humph.  So I turn around and target the placeholder.  No sooner do I do this
then Wolfform attacks the placeholder.  I do a /time and find that it's 2am!
I'm shocked.  Wolfform kills the placeholder in one or two blows and goes
back to the spot he was sitting previously.

I turn back to him.  "You just killed the placeholder."

No reply.

"It's 2am.  I thought you were only supposed to kill him at 7am or 7pm."

No reply.

"And the placeholder has a three hour spawn time."

No reply.

I am utterly befuddled.  I shrug my shoulders and decide that I'm not gonna
make progress on the Aegis of Life tonight.  Out loud I say, "Well, good
luck to you.  I think you're going to have a long wait."

No reply.

I buff myself in preparation for my departure.  Wolfform casts a series of
spells, one of which imbues me with Call of Earth just as I'm running for
the zone.  "Thanks" I tell him.

"np", he answers.

So he *can* hear me.  Hmph.

The day was a complete waste for me; I lost XP dying once and made none of
it back, plus my computer crashed a couple of times at the most inconvenient
times.  I did help a guildie get some boots he wanted out of Solusek Eye, so
that was good.

Still, my thoughts linger on that first encounter.  I have two theories:

Wolfform knew what he was doing and didn't want to clue in a relative lowbie
on the correct procedure for camping Grimrot.

Wolfform knew nothing about how to camp Grimrot and didn't want to admit it.

Which is it?  Does anyone know the correct procedure for camping Lord
Grimrot at the undead ruins in SK for the Aegis of Life?

Thanks for the illumination.  ^_^
