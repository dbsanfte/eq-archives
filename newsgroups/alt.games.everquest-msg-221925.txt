/agree

There was a desolute warrioir in crushbone (was there with my ranger just
making sure my faction was bottomed / topped :P), as they couldnt get
arborean sapling sap, I said I would help.

I have max tracking, in 3 hours, we killed maybe 8 saplings and he / she
(female avatar) got ONE sapling...

The quest I did for jeweled quiver of the hand was a better item and far
less infuriating than this.

Im not sure how I ever managed to finish my rangers newbie armour (TWICE, I
restarted when I changed from a PCG account).
