This was very much concidered rude to do in the past .. I have noticed many
just do it not. it is start of the and no way to stop them from doing it.
Manners are near unexistant inthe world to day it seems.  I role play and
people walking up and just looking is like  walking up to someone on the
street and opening their purse or pocket and saying wow neat.   accidents
will happens   a simple OOPS will make those ok  ..  Please people ask first
