We hunt there a lot looking for spell drops for Tiru and our druid and
shammy friends who we group with. Often have a ranger and/or bard with
us too. Always somebody with tracking, and I constantly ask them to keep
an eye out for named mobs, oddballs, etc. for me to pull. Never heard of
that one. Beastlord quest or somesuch?  Or maybe some wurm that has some
information on the entry to the Planes of Power? Just guessing here.
