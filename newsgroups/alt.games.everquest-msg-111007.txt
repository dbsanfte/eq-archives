Cool.  Thanks for those answers.  And no, I'm not intending to go PvP - I
was never that interested in it, I just noticed the apparent difference and
wondered what the explanation was.  Personally I think this game can be
frustrating enough when only the mobs can kill you, without having to worry
about other players as well...!

As for the noticeboards, well, they're probably not very interesting, but I
have simple tastes.  I guess I'll have to keep on looking, as the old
adverts used to say.

And corpses - that's handy for another three levels, anyway, and hopefully
after that I can be some use to someone...
