On Sunday, Jan 13th, I will finally be doing General V'Ghera in Kith.  I and
my guild are teamed with another guild and their Rogue, Cerebral and plan on
spawning him twice.

I have a question with regards to rogue poisons.   I have read that General
V'Ghera is weak to rogue poisons and I am wondering which poisons I should
try and make/use?

I figure that I can pass some out to the rogues there helping and maybe have
them do a wee bit more damage than normal.

Lannella, I am posting this here because I switched comps and lost my
safehouse password.  I will try and dig it up but if you could help with the
poison info, I would appreciate it.

Thanks in advance.

Orlun, 54th dwarven rogue, Xev
