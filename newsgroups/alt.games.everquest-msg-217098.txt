We had both a druid and a wizard.  The druid had *just* gotten his stone, this
was his first adventure.  The wizard is the one who got us cursed, even though
we had said up front "Do NOT TOUCH BOXES".  (he didn't touch it.  he inspected
it.  sigh.  My BF was furious.  But, as I pointed out to him, the wizard
admitted it immediately, and apologized profusely, ad nauseum.  I gave him alot
of credit for being a Stand Up Guy with all of us standing around asking "who
did it?").
The MT was spinning around in circles when the evac "kicked in".
I hadn't even *thought* of a "succor".  Does that put you back at the zone in
point?
FWIW, we got the "you have failed your mission" message a minute or two into
the battle.
I appreciate everyone's input.
In the future I think I'll just keep my mouth shut.  Maybe :)  Probably.  I
don't know.  I hate death when I'm on cleric duty.
