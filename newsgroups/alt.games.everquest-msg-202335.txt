I read a post a few weeks ago about someone pulling several mobs in
Karnor's Castle doing this very same thing.  I think it's called zone
kiting or something like that.  I'm surprised you can run fast enough
to the zone without getting beat on.  I guess if you have SoW that
would help matters.


In regards to your question on pathing exploit:  It's probably an
exploit.  :o)
