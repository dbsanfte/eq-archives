    It's tough. The best way I've found is to keep the pet back until the
target is alone, then send him in. I do this by taking the first hit from
the mob I'm pulling, then backing away. It's not elegant, but I'm twinked
well and it works.

    Mistake. Have the enchanter AoE stun first. When the mob is stunned, you
can back it off cleanly. That's about the only way I ever found to back a
pet off a mob cleanly - stun the mob, back the pet off, then deal with the
mob however.

    No. Not until you get enough alt XP to get the /pet hold command. :-( In
larger groups it's easier - you can hold the pet back until only one live
mob is engaged, then /assist and send it in. If the enchanter is up to it,
you could get him to start mezzing stuff well before it gets to your "camp"
area - that would at least stop broken mezzes.

    Where are you pulling? If you're high enough for Feign Death you can
actually pull pretty well - not as well as a monk, but better than most.

    If you are well-twinked mana-wise, try playing with Screaming Terror
when you hit that level. It's a real mana pig at low level, but it's a good
skill to master. At higher levels it rocks when a necromancer can lock down
adds.
