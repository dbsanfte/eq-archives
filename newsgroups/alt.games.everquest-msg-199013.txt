The entrance to CC is inside a little room out behind the RyGorr fort, but
inside the walls surrounding that fort.

When you get behind the fort, you'll see the room with a gate, usually closed.
Click on that and it opens to a small area with a crystal sphere on a pedastle.
Click that and you zone in.

Getting -to- the room can be a problem, although hardly an insouluable one.

--------engage sarcasm mode-------------------------------------

If only shaman had SOW you could just run in and click the ball with mobs
chasing you.

If we only had Invisibility you could just walk in, tweak the noses of the
various orcs, and then stroll over to the ball

If we only had levitate, you could find a nice high spot outside the walls, jump
off and soar over them, staying out of aggro range of the orcs till you get into
the room

If you were only high enough level to take on blue mobs (that are, by the way,
blue at 30) you could kill the roughly 4 centurions that stand in your way.

But as you are a mere 38 shaman, you'll have to chose between dying, having your
body dragged to the room, and rezed there in safety (probably by a cleric who
really -can't- do any of the above) or waiting till a level 30 shaman comes in
and clears all the mobs out of the way for you.

------------------sarcasm mode off-------------------------

Inside CC you will be at the upper end of an apparantly dead end passage.  Turn
around and go towards the dead end, though, and you'll be zoned back to that
little room.  While the room is out of range of all the outdoor orcs roaming or
stationary, its possible that someone else came in recently trailing mobs behind
them, or some people pull to the room to fight, so be careful.

Down the passage you'll find orcs and more orcs, Miners (lowest level) Watchmen
(higher) and Oracles (higher and shaman).  There's a bit of a three dimensional
maze leading down, or there's a shaft that hits a lot of levels and runs all the
way to the bottom; its possible to jump down there with lev and invis on with
total safety.

From the bottom of the shaft there's one exit, go out that and right and you'll
eventually get out of the rock and into the ice area (not slippery), follow that
further and you'll come to the Coldain town.  These coldain are on a different
faction than the ones in Thurgadin.  I can't say for sure about ogre shaman and
whatever god you worship, but a troll shaman of innorruuk was apprehensive to
them with only a few rygorr killed (didn't try them before killing any at all so
I can't say)  I'm able to use the bank but not the vendors.  They've changed
things recently so that killing rygorr gives faction down here, so if you work
RyGorr regularly for a few levels I suppose you'll be able to sell here as well.

I killed a -lot- of coldain in Great Divide, dropped my faction there, and no
change at all in CC.

The city itself is a bit of a maze, but there's a passage leading down from
there to some Terrors at a broken bridge.  Cross the water there and you come to
a passage, up some stairs and back down the other side, and on your right there
will be a stone passage leading thru the Geo cave, which is a long twisting ramp
(but not a maze, there are no choices other than to keep going or to go back
down) at the top end of which is an alternate exit from CC, this puts you inside
that weird little building just outside the RyGorr fort area.  Watch out here,
there are often a roaming RyGorr or a Frost Giant here, and sometimes an
invisible backstabbing traitor dwarf (KOS to all?  Or perhaps he's on one of the
giant factions) and people coming out here and not paying attention sometimes
end up dead.
