Try not to be.  It's one thing to be on guard, it's another to mistrust
someone who disagrees with you, simply for the fact.  I think you've read
enough of my posts to know that I would likely be a fair judge (if I were
willing to get entangled in the legal industry), even though I would likely
want to post the Ten Commandments.

It's a matter of following the roots.  America was founded in the Christian
tradition, it was build on a Christian foundation.  There has benn a great
effort to deny that (which is sad when you try to rewrite history that way),
but it is still so.  Or nation has a heritage to always be mindful of.  THAT
is why I support displaying the Ten Commandments.  Similar documents from
other religions simply don't have the historical significance (to America)
that the Ten Commandments do.
