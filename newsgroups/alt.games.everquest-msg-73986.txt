While Charm and Pet are mutually exclusive, Mez is decidedly not.
Mez is not to be used on your current target, it is designed to stop
all those pesky adds from killing you while you work on your current
victim.   Since your pet will pick one target and stick on it till it
dies
before moving to the next target, mezzing any adds works great
while using a pet.  Only thing you need to remember is that your
pet will go to the next target that hit you after his current one dies...

which might not be the one you would have liked.

> Summon a pet (5th circle)

While you may have your pet targetted when casting Lesser Shielding,
the buff is hitting you, not him.  Not that you shouldn't have LS up
on yourself... but if you already have it, no need to cast it again here.

you can tell your pet to guard... but he won't listen.  In fact the
enchanter pet is entirely deaf, cannot be reasoned with in any way.
He will follow you around, attack anything that attacks you and
is in his aggro range... and there's not a thing you can do about it.

Sense heading should be slaved to your left and or right turn
arrows so you don't have to slavishly slam a button 24 hours a
day just hoping for skillups.  Beg is useless, unless you want
it as a taunt, in which case you want it as low as possible, its
-fails- that piss off the mobs, not successes.  As a chanter, I
can't think of a time you'll need this taunt, its for the tauntless melee

classes.

For your down time, I reccomend the newspaper, the dishes, or
(if you really must EQ) Fishing.  Gems is popular too... but I don't
care for it myself.

He won't, I repeat, listen.  When that mob you tashed
smacks you, he will engage, not before (and not after,
so make sure you can get to a good fight spot before you
get hit)

You want the mob to regain the upper hand?  Funny, most people
would think you'd want pet to have the upper hand.

Your pet is -still- deaf as a post. If you fear, the pet will chase.
While
this is good as it means free hits, its also bad as it likely means the
mob
reaches help of one kind or another.  Especially bad if you've foolishly
decided to ignore Mez in your spell list.

Another problem with your plan: your pet is doing more than half
the damage, so you are getting only half the exp.  If you can't
figure out how to do more damage than your pet, then you should
find a partner.  You will still get half the exp per kill, but with a
partner
you will probably be able to kill twice as many mobs per hour... more
if you've selected a partner and strategy that works well with your
abilities.
