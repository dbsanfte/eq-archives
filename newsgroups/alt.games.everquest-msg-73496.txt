www.eqtraders.com will be your friend for tradeskills.  I have not found a
better site yet, except for some individual tradeskills, and eqtraders links
you to those instead of attempting to duplicate the efforts.  The one
exception is www.lokari.net for tailoring, eqtraders does not link you to
that.
