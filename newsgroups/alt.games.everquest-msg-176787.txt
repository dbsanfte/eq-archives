Here's two of my own playing an Enchanter

FLW:

Enchanter: "Don't worry I've got it under control." 
- Party Wipe

followed by -

Enchanter: "I've got it under control."
*Evaced*
Enchanter: "Hey!  I had it under control, Damit!"

The most memorable time this happened was in mistmoor with 10 mobs
trained onto us.  I acutally had them all mezed at a couple points,
unfortunately we kept getting trained with more.  This is a fairly
common occurance.
