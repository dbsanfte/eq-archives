It's just part of the same brain damage SoE has had since PoP.  They have the
erroneous belief that not having all spells for a caster is no worse than not
having the highest-end armor for melee.  This is probably accurate for nukes
and some buffs, where lower-level versions still work.  It's simply wrong for
spells that are level-locked, and just stop working as you level.

This particular idiocy is that in order to mez mobs above level 70, you must
get your 69 spell, which doesn't drop reasonably commonly anywhere, and only
barely tolerably in places that have mobs over L70.

They did it again in DoN and DoDH (kinda - they didn't add any required
spells, so no harm that you can't get them), and will continue to do so. 
Your best spells are avaialable only to very high-end groups, even if
those spells are needed to get into high-end groups.  Get used to it.
