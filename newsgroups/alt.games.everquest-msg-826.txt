Being a Troll, i haven't been able to find ANy cheap food in Grobb, so I
took up fishing.  Lots of water around, and it's very worth it!  Bait costs
me 4cp, and fish, if you dont eat them, are worth 2-3sp.  But I use them for
food.
My fishing skill is around 25 right now, and I get a fish an average of
maybe once out of 5 or 6 casts.  Good to do when sitting and healing!

However, if you have access to cheap food (like muffins for 6cp) then I
would say don't bother.  But when rations are the cheapest thing you can
find...
