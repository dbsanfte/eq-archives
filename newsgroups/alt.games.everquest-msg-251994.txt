I sold 400 points in one shot for 7k each 100; well worth it, since there
wasn't anything on the LDoN merchants I wanted, but definitley was in the
bazaar. :)

I've done ONE deepest guk, and loved it. It does seem a bit rare to find
anyone who wants to do anything other than mistmoore, though. I've done the
1 Deepest Guk, 7 Takish, and 41 Mistmoores (successfully...think I failed in
10 additional MMs, 1 Takish, and 0 in DG). I'd love to do an Everfrost or
Rujarkian sometime. I'll have to talk my guild into doing one soon. :)
