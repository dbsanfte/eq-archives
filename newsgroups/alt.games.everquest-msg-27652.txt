Higher resistances might be true. I've been running in Unrest last night and
only 1 out of every 5-6 attempts of my Malise spell got through. That's a
ridiculous number of resists considering I'm 10 levels above about anything
else there. I even got resisted by those lame Death Beetles which were green
to a lvl 18 guildie.
Plus of course, anything which wasn't malised resisted my nukes partially or
even completely. Trying to shoot down hags with 175 mana costing nukes doing
30 damage per hit is no fun...

Glad I still have a pet and a damshield for it which never fail me :)
