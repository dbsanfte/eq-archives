I realise my last post on this topic didn't come out quite the way I wanted
so here's what I meant to ask:

When you activate Mouselook with F12 you can hold down the right mouse
button to look around. Is there any way I can bind something OTHER than the
right mouse button to looking around? even somethng additional?
I'd like to be able to hold a key down as it's a bit more relaxing than
running around with the right mouse button pressed in constantly ( yes I've
had a few too many First Person Shooters in my past :) ) I do really like
having mouselook on, I just find the right button a bit wearing after a few
minutes.

Thanks!
