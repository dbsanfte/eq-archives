If you're going Iksar, then I'd recommend that you go with 5 points in Dex
(to help when you get weapons with procs later on) and the rest in Sta. You
can get fairly decent gear that will more than make up for not putting any
in Str.

If you've got the money, buy a Robe of Living Fungus in the Bazaar. Its what
my Monk (who is Human) is wearing, and the stats (and weight) are darn good
for a Monk. (I know of one Monk who wore one until he was in the 40's)
