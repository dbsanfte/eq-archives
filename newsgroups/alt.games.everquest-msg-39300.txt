Then what your complaining about is your perception. What you want is
for EQ to regain it's virginity and sorry that isn't going to happen.
This TCC crap doesn't do it, and if you think it will stop farming if
a good item appears then your wrong. And you still haven't shown how
this helps low level players other then the added low level zones and
content, which could be added without TCC and do the exact same thing.
