It sounds like you might prefer the atmosphere on Firiona Vie server.
There isn't any force to the "Roleplaying Preferred" designation, but
it has a different ruleset and, in my experience, a higher proportion
of "roleplayers" (i.e. people who avoid as much as they can references
to anything outside of the game world, mostly avoid using abreviations
and acronyms, ant etc.).  It also has a much lower proportion of d00dz
and beggars.
The main differences in the ruleset from the "standard" servers are:
(1) you may have only one character per account,
(2) very few items are tagged NODROP
(3) the "Trivial Loot Code" (TLC) causes tagged items (MAGIC, LORE,
etc.) to poof if any member of the group killing an NPC is too high
level to get experience for the kill (you get a message).
The single character rule minimizes muling, twinking, and grief play.
The other two have a big impact on the economy of the server:
(a) You don't have legions of twinked alts consuming items, which tends
to push prices down, but you also don't have legions of pharmers out
there supplying the market, which tends to push prices up.
(b) You have a lot of items that are normally NODROP being sold, which
tends to push prices for equivalent items down, but you don't have
people going to great lengths to acquire NODROP gear as you often see
on standard servers, creating a demand in the market which pushes some
prices up.
The lack of alts to twink seems to have the biggest impact on the
prices of tradeskill products, the small market makes for very few
tradeskillers and somewhat higher prices than on other servers.

 From some of your comments I suspect you would most like the near
absence of beggars of any sort, along with the higher proportion
of active roleplayers.  A nice side effect of the more visible RP
population is that most players who don't go out of their way to RP
are, hmm, how to put this... are "actively tolerant" of RPing.  An
expample of this is that non-roleplayers will often apologize for
acting or speaking in an unusually OOC fashion.  This is quite a
contrast to the arrogant disrespect towards roleplaying often seen
on the standard servers.  I haven't seen many obvious roleplayers
on Tunare in a couple years, tho DT claims to know of (be a member
of?) an RP guild there, so it looks to me like they've "gone
underground" as it were.

My 32 Druid on FV is my most played alt (my "main" is a 54 Paladin
on Tunare), and I definitely enjoy playing there as a change of pace
from the usual "gamer" environment on the standard rules servers.
It's worth noting that I am almost never /anon or /role with my
Druid and yet I have never been asked for any buff and the only
time I was ever asked for a port was when I was L28 and couldn't
help the person out anyway.  Oh, I did just last night have an
Enchanter on a corpse run offer Breeze for SoW, but that's hardly
begging.  :)  And this morning I responded when somebody offerred
in a public channel to pay for a ride out of Eastern Wastes, but
again that's not the sort of begging/demands that Druids on the
standard rules servers report.
