Al`Kabors Expansive Mind effect isn't exactly FTX, but for general
discussion it is.

According to the spdat parser,
Al's EM is 10mana/tick

FTI is 1mana/tick
FTII is 2mana/tick
FTIII is 3mana/tick
FTIV is 0mana/tick
FTV is 5mana/tick
and FTVI through FTX are all listed but with 0mana/tick on them.

So, while logically FTX would be 10 mana/tick, it's not.
