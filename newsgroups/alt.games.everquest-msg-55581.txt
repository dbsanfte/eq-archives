Confirm dropping or confirm destroying. Where is the difference? They were
going to make dropping coin the same as dropping an item. I agree that this
is another one of those easy way outs for them but even so you would still
have to confirm the coin drop. All this will really do is make coin transfer
for players on the same account impossible without a third party.

Now if they really wanted to do it right they would put in the option to
allow conformation of dropping of coins like the fast destroy option.
