Oh my goodness.... I'll be allowed to use my pet on raids? Its been so long,
I forgot how! Its '/pet attack', right? :)

Seriously, this is nice. I'm all hyper now. I'm a little worried about how
this will affect soloing necros and mages. If I can efficiently heal a pet
while only doing 5pt of damage to a mob, I might be a super leveling
machine! But I dont know how well I can heal my pet, I've never really used
the pet heals... Necros already are super soloers with fear kiting, now they
dont have to worry about overpowering their pet? Yow! Maybe because it'll
take longer to kill things, everything balances out. Interesting anyways,
should be fun to play with.
