As per subject.
What is a reasonable activity level for a guild?

I am currently on the look out for a new guild and following the advice,
have been researching guilds, Mostly from their Webpages (where they
work) and I am beginning to wonder if guilds are really worth it. From
what I am finding, many are lucky to have an activity a month. Is this
the norm?
