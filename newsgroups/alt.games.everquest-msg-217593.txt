Other than certain guilds, personally, I'd worry more about unguilded 
folks.  A person in a decent guild has a lot more to lose, namely, his 
guild tag.  A person in a crappy guild should be avoided period.

I will admit, I have used the excuse that a guildie needs my help in 
order to bail out of a bad group before, but, I have never, nor would I 
ever, bail out on an LDoN group, and remain in the adventure.

A person who pulss that kind of stunt would become known for it pretty 
quickly, and would find fewer and fewer willing to group with him, and, 
assuming his guild cared, would likely find that he is no longer tagged 
in the guild either.
