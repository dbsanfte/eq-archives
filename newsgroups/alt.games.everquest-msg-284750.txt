No.  What I was suggesting was that the MT might pick a target, not call 
assist, switch to a second target, and then call for assist on that 
target.  If people assist before the call, they may be on the original 
(and incorrect) target.

I'm interested in this idea, and can see how it might be beneficial, but 
I've almost never seen it done, certainly have never seen it done with 
any regularity.

This seems like a very good argument in favor of the MA <> MT idea. 
Perhaps I can convince the guild to move to this plan.

This raises a question, though, which is what class is ideal for the MA 
position?  We're talking someone unlikely to get aggro, and who won't be 
switching targets.  This means not a healer, not a melee DPS, not a 
wizard, not any CC class.    That leaves what, mage and real tanks?  MA 
should maybe be lowest ranked real tank?  Or mage who makes a point of 
really really really not getting aggro?

I can get pretty pedantic, I'll admit.  Home school the kids, have a 
couple dozen employees at some times of the year; lecture mode is pretty 
much the default.  And putting it in print only makes it worse, I hve 
the time to rethink and add in every last detail I can think of.

Luckily, I have the opportunity to run this by the AGE community before 
putting my foot in my mouth on the guild forum.
