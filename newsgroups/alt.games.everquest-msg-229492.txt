ahh yeah, if you run out of food and start getting the message 'you are
hungry/thirsty', you won't regen mana.  I remember that happening to me in
Oasis a few years ago.  But that's from starving yourself, not from being
out of stamina.

After looking around at some more message boards, I believe that some of the
old effects of low stamina have been removed.  Since it is essentially a
mana bar for melee disciplines and abilities now, the penalty for it being
empty is NOT being able to use your disciplines.  I believe the attack speed
reduction is gone (doesn't matter with more than 100 sta anyway).  Haven't
tested to see if I can jump with empty endurance though.
