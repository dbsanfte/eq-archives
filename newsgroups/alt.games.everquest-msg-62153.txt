Yes, that fixes it for one fight but upon firing my bow the  bow then stays
in my hands (on the odd occasion my sword will be in the other so I am
somehow swinging a two handed sword with a bow in my left hand) What you
said about equipping last maybe the trick tho...perhaps if I unequip both
then try from there, I remember something about the wrist slot will show the
item last equipped and the right hand bracer upon relogging so maybe it is a
similar thing.
