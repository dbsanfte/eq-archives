GetSumJ is not bright enough to understand that you're
not playing by his rules, you're playing by yours,
and therefore his self-scoring system doesn't apply
the way he thinks it does.

He's like a hobo declaring "another point for me!" every
time a leaf falls from a tree in the autumn.
It may keep him amused, but that doesn't mean the
trees are falling into his trap, nor that they consider
themselves on the losing end of the situation.
They have their own goals.
