While I am not displeased by these changes I can't help thinking
they'll do that (increase the duration of Eagle Eye so we're not
casting it every fifteen minutes and increase the drop rate for a
quest item for a weapon no one past 50 would use anymore except in
special circumstances) and nothing else and call rangers "rebalanced".

 the village, "now the Old Bear wants them talking as well? No good will
 come of *that*, I'll warrant. And who's to say the bones wouldn't lie?
 Why should death make a man truthful, or even clever? The dead are likely
 dull fellows, full of tedious complaints - 'the ground's too cold, my
 gravestone should be larger, why does *he* get more worms than I do....'"
