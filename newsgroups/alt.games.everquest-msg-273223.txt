Exactly.  Which is why those claims that EQ caused the divorces/job 
loss/death of all those other people are equally arbitrary.  In the end, 
it's something in the person itself that led to the outcome, not the game.

All I'm trying to point out is that if people can claim that EQ caused them 
to lose their jobs, than I can just as well claim that EQ saved my life 
Friday.  In the end, both claims don't hold up too well under scrutiny.
