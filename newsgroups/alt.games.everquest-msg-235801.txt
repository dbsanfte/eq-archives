As much as I hate replying to you Tyger for fear of being sworn at ..
there is no easy way to do this and a lot of downsides to using a
program such as Norton Ghost to backup your current setup and transfer
to a new computer.

Past bitter experience, only 15 computers so take that as you will (I
always build my own), has told me time and again that a complete reload
is the best way to go when setting up a new computer.  Just bite the
bullet and do it ... the new reload will reognise the differences in
your mobo and it will be much better in the long run.

On the positive side just backup your entire EQ directory and install
that, as is, on your new computer nothing is put into registry so will
be gtg.
