Oh yeah.  And no game mechanic is ever changed.  No aspects of
the design are ever reworked.  Everything about EQ is and has
always been exactly the same, as designed, since day one.

Bullshit.  The fact that you are able to take advantage of an
infinite supply of arrows does not make it a requirement.  If
a caster had an infinite supply of mana he'd use it, but that
would not make it a requirement.  You made it through 58 levels
plus how many AAs without this "necessity"?
