Replace Chinese with KFC or pizza and alter to show husband playing in same
room and you've just described 90% of my non-working life! I even built a
third computer out of old bits (P200, 64 mb RAM, 14" monitor) that we use to
look stuff up while playing!

BTW Barry, I'm assuming you must also be a UK player since you used the
delightful expression "tosser". I suppose "wanker" would have been a
complete giveaway!
