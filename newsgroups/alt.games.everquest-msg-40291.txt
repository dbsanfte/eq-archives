Before Kunark/Velious, that drop from Vox was incredible.

Now, with Jagged Ice Shards selling for about 4K (on my server),
I doubt you could get a _lot_ for it.  It's still a great weapon, but
with the level 10 halfling running around with his small dragonbone
shard, he's not going to put out the money on a Crystalline spear.

That's a tough call.  On my server, anyways, you'd need that spear and
around
3K in plat for a Trak Tooth.

Again, I could be wrong.  It IS a dragon drop, after all, but I've seen
level 25 rouges (misspelling intentional...."rouge" is to rogue as "dr00d"
is to druid :-)  ) running around with the quest piercer from velious, so
the Crystalline spear has lost some of it's "oomph."

Good luck to you! <secret handshake>
