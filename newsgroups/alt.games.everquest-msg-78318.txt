Oh man, I cannot emphasize how strongly I disagree.

It's almost become a battery test for me. If I see a guild that
decides to raid Najena, I know I am dealing with a guild with severe
choice of target problems.

Najena is the absolute worst dungeon in Norrath, even Verant knows it;
they had it on their list of dungeons to be improved (along with
Splitpaw and Mistmoore) but chucked the idea because it is so
inherently flawed (at least some parts of Mistmoore are interesting to
hunt!), and instead just change the loot and spawn tables on (very)
rare occasions.

Reiterated: DON'T raid Najena.

You can raid Mistmoore but because of the bizarre pathing in many
places expect wipeouts.

If you really want a neat 30-35 raid target go for Tower of Frozen
Shadow. Easily the best designed dungeon in the game, probably in any
MMORPG to date. Of course there may be people in there, unlike Najena,
but then, consider this... theres a REASON theres people in ToFS and
not in Najena.....
