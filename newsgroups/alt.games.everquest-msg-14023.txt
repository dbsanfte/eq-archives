that happened to me too first time i entered warrens. i was a chanter
so i just gated out but i did a petition anyway to let the gm know a
bug was there. as it turns out, the gm told me that room is used for
test purposes and people that didnt know to load the "optional" patch
(it is named OPTIONAL.....not
IF-YOU-GO-INTO-THE-WARRENS-YOU-NEED-TO-LOAD-THIS patch)
were sent to this room as protection from getting stranded someplace
where they might get killed. after i loaded optional everything was
fine.....albiet zoning into warrens and immediatly going to half
health cause a big train was at the exit so i ran around like a
chicken with my head cut off and all the exits looked the same to me
and i didnt know which one i came in from so i chose one and luckily i
got out alive.
