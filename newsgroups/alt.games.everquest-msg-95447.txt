My favorite beggar story:
I'm in the bank in Kelethin.  Some begger is there, and every 30 seconds or
so, he spouts off his "Excuse me sir, do you have anything for a new
player?" routine.  Every 30 seconds.

It got annoying.  So I pulled out 1000pp from my bank and dropped it on him. 
I let it sit there for several seconds, so that he could register that it
was ONE THOUSAND PLAT in his trade window.

Then I cancelled and said "Oh, I forgot.  I don't give stuff to beggars."

I think I hurt his feelings.  He suicided into a guard immediately after.
