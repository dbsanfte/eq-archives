Ghoulbanes are already too cheap, and Verant wants them expensive - drives
the economy or so they say.  I have seen a Ghoulbane go for 700pp!  A few
months ago you were lucky if they were 1500pp, at least on my server.
Furthermore, most people can afford something better than Ghoulbane these
days long before they can get it anyway.  But does that mean people will no
longer get it?  Of course not, because apart from being an icon itself of
the Paladin class, it is one of the components to our epic.
