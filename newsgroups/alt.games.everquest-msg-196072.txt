Because you're an idiot, or you don't know how to play your class.

Or any combination of the two.

Which Shamans never get.   And why are you using that for comparison
anyways?  The ATK bonus in Speed of Valon makes it superior to any other
haste spell.

Ever go to a dungeon?   Root parking only works in certain areas where you
have plenty of room to move, and only with small pulls.  Try root parking 4
mobs that come in at once and all hit for 450+

> Shaman can wear heavy armor.

Which makes a whole lot of difference when a mobs hit him for max damage
every swing anyways.

Another free clue.  Try casting Arcane Rune sometime.  Add 1500 hp to the
Enchanters max, I bet he beats a similarly equipped shaman.

As opposed to Clarity, which  you can not only put on yourself, you can also
put it on others in the group.   You should try it sometime.

Uh huh.


And as long as I'm feeding the troll, I guess I'll respond to a part of your
other post.

(Other post quote)

Yeah... as long as you don't mind only slowing the mob 40 percent instead of
80.


(Another free clue, you would have had a much stronger argument if you had
brought up the benefits of Malo over Tash, most notably the lower aggro and
reducing all resists instead of just magic)
