They could have created a user interface that contains no client side
everquest.exe as we know it and have you load it and other portions that
need to be changed from the server each time you play.  Any component
that needed to be updated on an ongoing basis could be dealt with in
that manner, though the cost would be a much longer load time for each
play session since you would have to load it from server even when not
updated.  What they won't be able to update will be zones themselves
unless they used this same process for actual zones.  I can't imagine
that would be a fun game to play though.
