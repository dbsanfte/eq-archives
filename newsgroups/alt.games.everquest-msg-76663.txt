hmm...
heres a way you MIGHT be able to get something out of it...
the higher your meditate skill, the faster you can memorize spells, possibly
scribe.. I forgot what skill does scribing but I think is either channel or
your level, so screw that.
Have the log on, memorize one of your highest level spells, with and without
the cloak. compare the times and see if they're any different.
