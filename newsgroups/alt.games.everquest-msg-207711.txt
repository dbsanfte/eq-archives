Having swapped my tolerable video card (GeForce 4200ti 128) with a 
superb one (Radeon 9800 Pro 128) it has become apparent that my system 
is heavily bottlenecked somewhere. With all Luclin models on, textures 
set to medium quality, and the clipping plane all the way out, the FPS 
counter from fraps.com reports a not-very-impressive 30fps when facing 
away from the Plane of Knowledge library, and a very-unimpressive-indeed 
4fps when facing straight towars it. Needless to say, I'm not exactly 
quivering with joy at this situation.

The rest of my system is nothing to write home about (Athlon XP 2000+ (1.
6Ghz real speed), 768MB of DDR ram), but I think I could honestly expect 
better performance from this setup.

Does anybody know of a good set of (preferably freeware) diagnostic 
utilities I could test my system with? I have a hunch it's perhaps a 
problem with the AGP port (although I have installed the latest AGP 
drivers from my chipset manufacturer), but it would be nice to be sure.

Thanks.
