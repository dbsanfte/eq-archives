That is a gross misrepresentation of the Allakhazam poll.  The 35% you
refer to think "It's a nice concept but needs refinement," which in my
book counts as a vote FOR the code if they fix certain things (most
probably, the inclusion of quest items, which as we saw in the last
patch is already in the process of being fixed).

The split is a lot closer to 50/50.
