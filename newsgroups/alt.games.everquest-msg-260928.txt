It's just you.

Sure, this could get annoying, the same as listening to some idiot
begging for plat in the PoK, or someone whining about the latest nerf
in this newsgroup.  I did see a mute checkbox, so I'm sure you can
turn it off if you don't like it.

But... it made our whole group laugh.  It was fun.  It was a change
from the "get exp/get loot/get AAs" grind.  If that grind is what you
are looking for, then forget the voices.

It also could be pretty useful if used properly.  How many times have
you lost the "Add" or "Switch targets" message in battle spam?  I
believe it's possible to add your own messages (haven't tried it yet).
Just being able to *hear* someone call adds or call for evac would be
worth it, laughter value aside.

Ok, you can go back to getting level 70 now.
