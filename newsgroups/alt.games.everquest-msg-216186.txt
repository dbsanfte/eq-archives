I'm afraid I don't pay much attention to the progress of EQ2, as far as I know
its currently still vaporware, not even on the horizon for a beta release, no
visible progress in the past year.

The features you mention sound like tired old ones stolen from Ultima, and as
far as new environments, EQ has proven itself quite capable of scrapping zones
and rebuilding them without needing to migrate to a whole new game and killing
every character I own.

I think if I really wanted to stop playing EQ, the last thing I'd want to do is
move to EQ2; surely two years from now when they finally release EQ2 there will
be at least one other game out there that's learned something from the years EQ
has been out there, and yet has something fresh behind it.

What I don't get is what makes EQ2 even a gleam in the eyes of SOE: they've
revamped the EQ game engine more than once, they've released new interfaces, new
levels, new spells, new mobs, new zones, they've changed old zones, old mobs,
old spells, old items; what is there about EQ that couldn't be upgraded to
whatever new functionality they have in mind for EQ2?

Whenever I hear EQ2, I can't help but think of the marketing disaster of the
1980s: New Coke.  The Coca Cola company looked at their vast market share,
noticed that Pepsi, a slightly sweeter product, was picking up a bit in the
critical teen market of the times, and concluded that they needed to change
their recipee.  So they came out with New Coke, even sweeter than Pepsi, and
killed old coke so we'd all have to switch.  Instead, the vast majority of
existing Coke drinkers switched to Pepsi while complaining bitterly.

So then the great marketing coup of the same decade (so great that you have to
suspect that maybe it was the point all along); Coke released "classic coke",
which brought back most of the defectors, plus cemented a bunch of people who
originally couldn't have cared less whether they were drinking coke or pepsi in
to this classic coke stuff, since it represented a moral victory over the great
Coke company, and showed that they mattered and that Coke, in the end, respected
them after all.  Funny thing is, Classic Coke wasn't the same thing as the Coke
that had been phased out before the New Coke mess; it was made with Fructose
instead of Sucrose, and was in fact sweeter than plain old Coke.  But compared
to New Coke it wasn't nearly as sickeningly sweet, and since Coke had been
pulled months and months beforehand, you didn't have the old stuff to compare
with.

Is there a parallel with EQ2? I doubt it really, but maybe; perhaps they'll pull
the plug on EQ, then rerelease EQ with some EQ2 changes after a while when
people get sick of full bore EQ and its visibly failed; then they get to combine
the two into one.  I can't see the benefit of that, though.  Hmm, how about they
create EQ2 as a "fresh start" but then six months later suddenly figure out how
to let us import our original EQ characters into EQ2, but with the new
"features' like item decay, and pull the EQ plug, so if we want to keep playing
we have to buy EQ2 even though we don't really want to move; the "classic coke"
part would be in generously letting us keep our characters after all.

Ah well, its late and I'm getting a little far fetched in that perhaps.
