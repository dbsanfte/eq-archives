This is a great point. At this point, my main group is my wife, and she
does not hesitate to gear up in the bazaar. I can usually expect to see
her spend an hour or so in the bazaar looking for the best deal on her
latest monk upgrade, usually spending no less than 1K in plat unless
someone missed a zero when putting their stuff up for sale. We have an
infrequent group of friends we like to play with when schedules permit,
but many of them also prefer to bazaar themselves out.

Pick-up groups, at least the ones available during my play times on my
server, pretty much expect you to be PoP geared.

I would wager a lot also depends on server-specific economy, as well.
I've noticed quite often what goes for several thousand plat on one
server may only go for a couple tens of plat on another. Saw a lot of
that during the server mergers, actually. So this is pretty relative.

Normally I wouldn't, and historically I haven't. It's a recent
development after I attempted to participate in some pickup groups
going to areas that have been particularly difficult for my regular
groups to get involved in, such as PoJ and Draniks Scar. Though I was
tank class (SK), my lack of stats relegated me to pretty much standing
around, occasionally getting a hit in, and even then at emberassingly
small amounts. Heh, even the groups 51 enchanter and 52 Cleric had more
HP's and AC than my 48 SK :)

It's also quite possible, perhaps even probable, that I've just been
having bad luck this past year playing of only finding twink pick-up
groups, and I should just stop bellyaching about it.
