You should add "Player driven" to that as well.

Several zones, like Kithicor, have been changed by GM quests, even
permanently... this is the only one though where it is completely up to the
players.   Usually one guild will want to "win the game" by being the ones to
release the sleeper... but other servers have avoided it completely, by mutual
agreement.  (or at least had, not sure if he's still sleeping on any servers
at this point.)
