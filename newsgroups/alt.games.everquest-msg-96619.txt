As someone else pointed out, these levels were never very difficult to
begin with.

But what I really suspect is going on is that Verant did some market research
and found out that lots of folks quit the game at these levels because of
lost corpses.  All my characters are way past those levels, so it makes no
direct difference to me personally, but if it gets more genuine newbies
in the game, I think that is a good thing.

If I had my way, everyone would keep their gear when they die.  This is the
single biggest thing that has kept me from exploring further, specifically
into dungeons.  Experience I can always get back, but gear can take much
longer to get back.

I solo almost exclusively, so I can see how others will have a different
opinion.

What's a "splat level"?

I will rejoice to see the hell levels go.  I almost quit when I realized
how slow my exp was coming when I first got to 35.  It's a bug and should
be killed.

I have two characters at level 51 and I'm no longer levelling them because
I can't face 9 hell levels in a row.  My current character is about to hit
40 and I will be very happy not to have to spend twice as long at that
level.

>And yes, the spell book is going away. 

Good.  Again, the characters I play are way past this, but if it keeps
newbies in the game, it is a good thing.
