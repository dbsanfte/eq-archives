They covered this before I think, can't happen due to the way the
object system is set up. Each object in EQ is a PERM object. For
instance, fine steel dyed plate is NOT fine steel plate with a DYED
atribute added to it. Rather it took several people working full time
for several weeks to manually go in and insert A Crimson Fine Steel
Breastplate = Item you get when combining a fine steel bp with the
appropriate dye. Its a wholy new item. That is how objects are in EQ,
static. 

So what you are suggesting would not be possible in the current engine
because a note with "raid gathers at" is a FULLY DIFFERENT object from
a note which says "IOU 100PP" even though they are "notes", they would
have to be manually made and inputted by someone. The engine is not
capable of taking an object and just adding another attribute to it,
if it was the whole dyed steel plate thing would have been 99.9
percent easier to implement because it would have been Fine steel
breastplate, changeable attribute dyed (red, blue, light blue, etc)
That is what they wanted to do of course but found that they could
not.
