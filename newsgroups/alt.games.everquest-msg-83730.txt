This gent sounds like a person trying very hard to boost the popularity of a
game he plays by tearing down one that he no longer plays.  Is it possible that
he either did something that caused mim to be banned or that he merely wants to
see as many people play DAOC so that he is not required to believe himself the
only pitiful moron that quit before he should have.  Well, in either case, if
he merely wants to bash EQ and extoll the benefits of DAOC, I am sure they have
a newsgroup for them.  So, My advice is he frequent that forum and stop proving
himself the moron he is.
