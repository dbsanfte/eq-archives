Hmm, very good idea; although I already have more hot buttons than I know
what to do with. :) So annoying remembering to switch back to the first hot
button page when I'm on the second...'What's going on, why isn't my complete
heal casting?' *look at hotbuttons* 'Oh, wrong hotbutton window...Clav?
Clav? Oh hell, sorry, I'll rez ya in a sec.'

:)

*grin* If this part was to me, I was jokingly referring to my friend, the
warrior-brother of my character, as my 'pet' (which, after all, any good
warrior is to the spell caster he serv...uh, teams up with).

Before the patch, I could click ANYwhere near a portal stone in PoK and
bam...zone. The last time I was trying to click on Clav to target him for
some buffs (I rarely do try clicking on him now, just use the Fbutton when
we're grouped, but for some reason was in the mood to click), while standing
on the edge of the platform thingy looking down at him where he was on the
little steps leading up to it...and zone into Feerrott. Oops.

I'm hoping they addressed the rain/crashing problem I had last night...I
played today on my lunch break, had no crashes, but did notice the sky
seemed to be gone...coulda just been the zones I was in where I had the sky
turned on, though (Feerrott and Oggok, I don't turn on the sky in PoK). I
just saw the sky last night for the first time, at night, and man, it was
gorgeous. Sony did something right when they changed the sky, I just hope it
hasn't been taken away. :)
