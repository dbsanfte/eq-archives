And I agree!.  Whats the difference if we were "born" with it (marlarkie),
or grew into it - what difference does it make?  Its a BEHAVIOR !  
...Are you impling that you can't "control" your sexual "urges",
or your sexual "preference" ?.  (which is it) If you can control your 
"urges", then "preference" is never an issue in a non-sexual setting, 
then IS it ??  Or are you saying that you want some special reconization
*of* "preference" when NOT in sexual settings ?  The issue in this
becomes the forcing of acceptance/tollerance of "beliefs" and
likes/dislikes of NON physical attributes, and I flat-out think
that is wrong.  We should all be allowed to like/dislike things
like "behaviors", beliefs, religion, personal preferance, and any
other NON physical attributes.  Face it, we sterotype all the time
about non-physical things.
