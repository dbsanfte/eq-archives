Actually, I'd be content with building a distance sort into /who all so that
I see the people in the closer zones before I see the people in the more
distant zones. For example, if I'm in east commons and do a /who all 10 15,
I get: everyone 10 - 15 in west commons, then every one in nro, then
nektlos, then efp, then oasis, etc. until I get my get a list of 50 people
(or whatever the limit is). At least this way, I'm a hope of being able to
find someone within walking distance.

As for looking for more ... I'd actually prefer to see it extended: looking
for warrior, looking for cleric, etc. Let the group leader turn on as many
LF<class> as he wants.

It would make my life much easier if I can then do a /who all lfm 12 18 and
see all the groups who are looking for a monk and know, if there are too
many, then the ones I didn't see are probably too far away to worry about
anyhow.
