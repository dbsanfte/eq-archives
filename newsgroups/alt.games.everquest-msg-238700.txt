I was in an all 65 ldon that only had a druid as a healer, which is fine,
ive done these before with just druids and it was fine (keep in mind
however, that 65 is dramatically harder than say.. 50)

Anyway, I get in the group and I discover the leader is ranger, and not only
that but there is no pure tank class, so im thinking.. humm... I just filled
the last spot in a group with no cleric, and a ranger as the tank.. before I
could figure this out though he accepted a mission, he accepted it like
RIGHT AFTER I joined, so I got no vote in that at all.. well, it only took
me a minute to figure out what we had in our group. I was willing to
continue under these conditions even tho I felt I was tricked into it.  so
we all set a course to the zone in area and the chanter goes linkdead.. im
thinking to myself "who didnt see that coming.."  a person in the group
INSISTS that she will come back and its just a storm in her area knocked her
off, and lets head on in. I reply to the group something along of the lines
of "HELL no", im not going in a dungeon with a ranger as tank and no crowd
control. so we sit outside of the zone in for 28 minutes waiting on her to
come back. with 2 minutes to go they wanted to zone in without her. so I
quickly disbanded and left adventure before they did so it wouldnt count as
a loss for me too.


thoughout the 28 minutes we waited one of them wanted several times to go
in, and I said quite clearly each time that I will *not* go in without the
chanter, and stated why, first and most important. the only form of crowd
control at that point is also the healer, and secondly, I will not assist
someone who instantly goes linkdead get points for a mission they did not
help with.

Plus it was in poor taste to sign up for an ldon mission if a thunder storm
is hanging over your house anyways.
