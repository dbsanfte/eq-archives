You're high about $50 for that machine around here (Teac floppys are
$10, low end CD-Roms $30, and no mouse/kb (She had good ones, no need
to buy cheap ones to replace them.)) The nice thing about the 2 local shops
I buy from is that they throw in assembly. I used to really like 
building the things, but time is a lot tighter now.

Of course I saved another $85 on the CPU/MB/HD as her machine sees only 
occasional gaming when my buddies come over.  They don't have anything
better, so they don't notice the difference that celeron makes.  When
we were discussing the new machine, I fudged the figures a bit to allow
for the GF2 and the extra 128MB.  She doesn't *mind* the games (she 
thinks it's a bit of a silly hobby) but might have put her foot down
at the notion of spending extra money soley to make her machine 
capable of playing games.
