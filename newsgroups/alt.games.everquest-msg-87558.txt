I played UO for 4+ years since launch - maybe I can help with the
comparisons...

Buy the Everquest Trilogy to begin with - and I think you need that before
you buy the Luclin expansion anyway.  There is plenty of EQ to enjoy and get
a feel for in the original lands, Kunark, and Velious (the Trilogy set).
The Shadows of Luclin expansion will tax your system (as spec'd) and
probably wouldn't provide optimal enjoyment.  My advice, get the trilogy -
make some levels - see the world, see if it's worth the hardware upgrade to
meet SoL's min specs.

You can do whatever you want.  Over in the UO newsgroup another veteran and
I were chatting about how he likes to just log in and see whats happening in
Destard for instance and how it was maybe not the same in EQ.  I log into EQ
and go check my favorite places quite often and another fun thing is hooking
up with guildmates wherever they are.  Sometimes I just hang around newbie
hunting areas and buff/heal them - which is kinda fun for me and a way to
wind down after a day of slaying evil.  You could spend hours just hanging
in your server's common market area (on my server- east commons tunnel) and
trade and barter your way to fortune.

Ya know, I think as expansions have arrived in EQ - the hot spots have
become more vast and varied.  I quit a few weeks after EQ launched and in
the original EQ world, with as many people as there are subscribing, I can
see some pretty ugly situations because of crowding.  Now days?  I have 50
places to go to do 50 different quests are kill 50 different rare-dropping
creatures.  Just almost a non-issue except for possibly the most uber of
gear - which of course is what joining a good guild helps with.
