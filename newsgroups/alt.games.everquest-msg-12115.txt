Slightly less blatant, but anyway...

A guildie somehow got himself killed twice deep in Lguk the other day. After
several abortive attempts at CR (he didn't know where his first corpse was,
left a naked corpse lying around, kept jumping in to fight while he was
naked, etc, etc), me and the other guildie trying to help him simply paid a
necro to do 2 summon corpses to pull them out. Of course, once we'd actually
explained to the guy what a summon corpse was, and why he should have looted
his naked corpse to get rid of it, thus saving us 175pp, and why he should
have a /corpse hot-button, and a /loc hot-button, and the inadvisability in
general of soling deep in a dungeon without an escape route...

I later found out this guy was L45, somehow he managed to come across as not
having a clue though.
