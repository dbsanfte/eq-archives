If they would they would never buy a personal firewall. The problem is a 
firewall running at the same TCPIP stack as the application computer (and 
even worse every application running in the admin space like windows 
does) is one problem (aka every local trojan could exchange or hook into 
the stack bypassing the firewall), 

The next problem is that a firewall is only as good as the user who can 
configure it, thus enabling a program with a trojan can cause a desaster 
where no PF can help. The next problem is that personal firewalls have no 
content scanners at all thus tunneling through protocolls is easy etc... 
the list goes on and on. Disabling a few features on a blank windows 
gives exact the same amount of protection a personal firewall gives. And 
if people think they have trojan protection, forget it. Many trojans 
tunnel through protocols and others hide behind applications by 
exchanging dlls. Additionally there is the fact that most users hit the 
permit button as soon as the firewall says a program wants out.

So basically a PF is a nice marketing ploy but nothing more.
