   You presented an idea and asked for feedback, he gave it.  I appreciate that
you are thinking up new ideas for us to talk about.   On topic and fresh ideas
are some of my favorite readings in this group.  However, if you post a new
idea, you might get some negative feedback about it.  The point Lance raises
here is at the heart of why the "semi permanent buff" thing wouldn't work.  I
personally hate recasting buffs.  This whole buff thing is one of the reasons
I'm a cleric now instead of the first class I ever played seriously, shaman.  I
just hated swapping out spell after spell after spell... and back then I didn't
have enough of a spine to tell the tanks that they didn't every icon I had. 
With cleric I just have to cast one or two buffs.  I still hate switching those
out, but it is a heck of alot more acceptable.  So, I would be inclined to agree
with your semi-permanete buff theory, but for the point Lance raises.

   Also, no matter what we say here, or how we say it, the chances of our
creating anything are exceeding small.  This is all just talk.  I don't think
that SOE devs are trolling here for ideas (though it would be nice if they
did).

  But I see you see this already.
