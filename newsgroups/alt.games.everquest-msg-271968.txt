You keep saying this but it just isn't so.
My mains (24 necro) best drops have been while soloing in Nektulos Forest.
I got a Master1 drop from a *solo* crab on the beach, and I got 2 palladium
clusters while harvesting. Any one of these items is worth more than all the
drops I have gotten till now while grouping.
