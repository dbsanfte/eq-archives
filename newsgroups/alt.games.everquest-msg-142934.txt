The game is so much better now it's not even funny... Unfortunately, no 
matter how good the game gets, you can never get back the thrill of 
discovery. The first month of EQ being live was *amazing*, even with 
bugs, horrible death penalties and endless anoyances.

Perhaps the first few months of EQ2 or SWG will be similar, but I doubt 
it... We've all become too familiar with the mechanics of MMORPGS.

wonderful power you have developed, and terrified at the thought that so 
much hideous and bad music may be put on record forever.
