Shield of Bane Warding.  I love mine.  It also has CHA 8, and SvM 12.  I got
mine a few days ago.  Two druids in guild have all their drops for it now,
and we should be getting them their shields shortly as well.  I think one
cleric has it too.  The shield is usable by Beastlord, Ranger, Shaman(yea),
Druid, Cleric, Paladin, all races.
