After trying to start on a team PvP server, and realizing that my wife and I
are just NOT tempermentally suited to a PK server we decided to restart on
FV. So far we LOVE it. Nice people, and peace and quiet after the hustle and
bustle of Kelethin on the Vallon Zek server. Ive got a few questions though.
First off, Im wondering if auctions/trading actually takes place on Fiorona
Vei. I know that being the newb that I am to EQ, that Ill be wanting to try
and trade/acution for some decent starter gear once weve earned a little
plat. ( And what I mean by "decent" is stuff better than the bits of cloth
armor and rusty weapons that we are currently using :] ) Is trading a
"no-no" on FV ? If so thats fine.. I can live with that. Secondly, my wife
has told me that shes not realy interested in joining a guild. she basically
looks at our playing time as "cheap dates", and would prefer to just spend
the time hunting/exploring/adventuring with me. Were a Wood Elf Ranger/Druid
team, and so far we seem to be pretty effective together. We just barely
dinged 6 last night though so I have no idea if well be able to continue to
be effective in the later levels. If I understand things correctly the lack
of a cleric will make deaths REALLY painfull for us. Lastly, if anyone has
any pointers for playing on the FV server, or heck, even pointers for EQ
newbs, Ib be glad to hear them  : ) And and ALL information is appreciated
!!
