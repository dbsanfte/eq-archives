No, not really.

There are no "major daytime playing hours."  People work or are in school
during the day.   So even a 10 hour patch will be done by 4PM Eastern...
well over an hour before prime time.   And I would be willing to bet that
numericly (if possibly not by number of hours played) the vast majority of
players are on during prime time (for thier time zone.)  5 - 11 PM.

I didn't do it often, but occasionally I have played during the days, when I
was off for whatever reason.   There were so few people on that it was very
hard to get any kind of a group going.  Our own guild, which would usually
have 30+ people on at prime time, would have a whole 3 people online.  And
no pickup groups going other than one or two all asian groups late-nighting
it (for them).  Estiamting from my own experiences, I would say that during
the daytime (non-weekend, non-holiday) server load is less than 1/4 of the
normal population.  (Not counting bazaar bots)

I think you'd be suprised.   3 AM Pacific is right into asian prime time, I
believe.  Or pretty close.

I've never seen them do it.

Another reason for the 3 AM Pacific patch time would probably be the
supervision.   It probably only takes one or two low level people to begin
patching the servers... So no worries about getting them out of bed.  If
theres a major problem with the patch that requires immediate fixing, or
possibly even an emergency patch, it'll come up after the servers are back
up and running.   A 3 AM Pacific patch time means the servers will likely be
up somewhere between 7 am and 2 pm Pacific.  Which means that the
programmers will be in the office on their normal working time, ready to go
on any problems.
