What i was saying was the mature rating is kind of misleading since it seems
most of the trouble I have experienced is with people below the teen level

In other words there are plenty of under teens playing and expect to have
more above teen rating type situations coming from them (ie: foul mouth,name
calling etc.)

I let my 3 year play - supervised - he just likes to whack the snakes and
spiders :)
