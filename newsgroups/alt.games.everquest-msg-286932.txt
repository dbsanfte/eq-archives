I had this problem after the recent pair of patches.  I seem to have 
fixed it now, although I can't be certain it was actually my fault or 
that what I did actually had any effect; could have been random chance, 
my ISP might have had some problems and fixed them without telling me, 
leaving me to think that the thing I did just before they fixed it was 
the solution.

I tried a good many things, most of which didn't seem to help, here's 
the one I did just before the problem cleared up:

I went thru and cleared out a bunch of software I haven't used in ages, 
then defragged my hard drive.

I -think- what happened is that my drive was pretty full and poorly 
organized, and the LON patch was the straw that broke the camel's back, 
filling it up to the point where zoning could take too long and the 
system would decide I was LD.

Sometimes I'd get kicked out to sever select, but sometimes I'd get 
kicked all the way back to the old login screen, thats when I got the 
login cannot be validated message... because EQ now requires the new 
login screen.  Solution to that was to log the rest of the way out to 
desktop and start over.

I have a seperate problem which crops up occaisionally, where I can't 
log in one given character on one given machine.  Same machine can log 
other characters in, or different machine can log that one character in. 
  Solution to that is to wipe the UI_charactername file, which is 
somehow getting corrupted.  BUT I found out what was triggering the 
corruption; it was trying to use the in game petition system.  Not only 
on purpose, but since its tied to the P button, I was doing it 
accidentally sometimes.  I wiped the P connection, and never try it 
deliberately, and haven't had that problem since.
