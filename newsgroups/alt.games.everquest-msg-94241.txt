True. There's competition and you have to keep it going. Some things
are twosided blades, like AA points. Real fun and cool of sorts, but
now every last dungeon for 50+ people is swarmed with armies of 60ies
eating up every mob for humbly exp groups of 50+ people trying to make
a
bit of exp. Hate that. And will do the same if I hit 60, I have to
admit.

Aye, the show must go on.

Actually, Kunark is full of areas from 1-60. Iksar (and others) can
autonomously
level all the way to 60 and never leave Kunark. I guess that was,
because
Iksar are just about screwed anywhere else, citywise (Actually, we get
screwed more and more, as more areas are created, and we're screwed
more and more, but our 'compensation' doesn't increase .. like being
KOS to Katta etc :P but that's another topic).

In a group you should do pretty fine. Soloing is of course not
something for
a warrior (unless fungi tuniced or something).

What is upper class? I was in Kunark at level 30, grouping in the bear
caves in GD without a problem and wasn't twinked at all.

Yes, but I never saw horses as viable good for trade or whatever to
normal people. They're more like a funny goddie to the richies. Status
object pure. Without them, you're not lacking much. SoW etc is
everywhere.

At 16 you should do fine in and maybe even going through paludal
caverns. The again, most of luclin is really designed for high levels
to ultrahigh superguild level areas (Umbral plains, Vex Thal, Ssraezha
Temple etc)

Can't parse that, even with a high INT :)

It was ok before AA, kind of. AA brought back a lot of decomissioned
60ies.
But this will even out in some way as well I guess. I would not want
to miss AA, though, it's fun.

At your level, the standard grinding hells (LOIO, FM, OT, later DL
etc) are all still quite normal as used to be. The trouble starts at
50 :)

Money is kind of exponential. I was poor till 50+. At 56 I had about
6k. My friends are in uber guilds, have 100+k etc. It's all about
trading in spots like EC (sell high, buy low), a LOT of time. Or being
in an uber guild, winning drops to sell nobody needs. Both need
stamina and time.

> grandchildren.

Depends on your playing. I play daily, addicted to this crap. If
you're a
casual player playing once a week .. will take years I guess. EQ never
was a fast advancing game with a normal, not PLed and not ubertwinked
char.
