Some minor spoilers below...












There have been changes, but you can still get your EM without killing
your Neriak faction.

On the lower floor, a few new mobs have been added: "boss" versions of
each regular mob.  For example, there's now an Avatar of Abhorrence, a
meaner version of the abhorrents.  Each mini-boss drops 2 pieces of the
regular mob's armour, plus a chance at a piece of Innoruuk's old loot.
When we killed the Avatar, he dropped 2 pairs of Woven Shadow boots
plus a Vexthorne.  These mini-bosses are level 56 -  no pushover, but
easier than the old Maestro.  The Maestro is also level 56 now.

The regular Hate mobs are unchanged, apart from the pleasant feature
of dropping more armour :-)

The upper floor is where the real changes have happened, it's now
populated with some completely new mobs, and these I believe have the
new faction hits - I didn't get to see these when I was there.   It now
apparently takes a very strong group to clear the top floor.  Innoruuk
at least is now a Velious-class ubermob with some new loot.  I *think*
Innoruuk worshippers are non-KOS on this floor (but definitely KOS on
the lower floor).

There are a few other changes to make life more difficult - get too
close to the ceiling and you'll be harm touched from above, meaning
that high on the wall is no longer safe.  The southwest corner no
longer has its static clerics & kira, but there's an evil little trap
there...

Oh, and all the mobs now have a new message when they die.  The
kiraikueis are my favourite... "My form was weak, your style
excellent.  I hate you!"
