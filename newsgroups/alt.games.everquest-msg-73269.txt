No, that is not true, you can buy all the molds in both Katta Castelum and
in Sanctus Seru.  You can also purchase the hilt mold in Shar Vahl, and the
dagger blade mold in Shadowhaven.  It does make it a pain, and just about
impossible for a low level character, but they molds are available on
Luclin.
