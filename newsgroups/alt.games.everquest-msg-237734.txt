	Weapons, for one, since a BST actually wants to maximize his
melee damage. 

Hitpoints, AC and focus effects are all things that are gonna affect
the BST a lot more than the mage. ... admittedly, focus items only
because the mage can summon them. 

A well equipped (and AA'd) BST can tank quite well at the high end but
it's gonna be fairly expensive to get him there.
