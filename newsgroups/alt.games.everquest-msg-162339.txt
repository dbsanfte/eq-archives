Wizards are a fantastic addition to any group, but for a sustained
damage output they can't touch a druid/necro combo.  If nothing else a
wizard will go LOM/OOM if they are trying to keep up a sustained
damage output.  A necro with regen can actually end a fight with MORE
mana than he started out with.

For duoing purposes, Wizards aren't the best class.  For a six man
group, if you want to end fights fast, wizards are great.
Particularly the closer they get to 50.

I've told the story before, but I'll tell it again for an example.  Me
and my guild were doing a 'raid' in Umbral.  Total of 21 people.  My
51ish druid was stuck on the three man group with a 55 wizard and a 60
rogue.  We got every single kill.  The wizard went LD, we got nothing.

Granted, the lions share of the damage was coming from the rogue, but
the wizzie was enough to get us the kill vs. three 55+ groups.

Trust me, I respect the ass-whupping power of the wizard.
