One of my fondest EQ memories is still the first time I
ventured out of the newbie areas of BB and GFay by following
someone to Orc Hill.  At night.

Everything was magic.  The nervousness of being far enough
from the city that I didn't know my way back.  The way the
dark-skinned orcs seemed to appear suddenly out of the
gloom of night.  The glow of the campfires in the darkness.
The social nature of the orcs as they ran in packs and
rushed to help each other out.  The hustle and bustle of
the busy hill, with a dozen adventurers doing constant
life-or-death battle with the waves of the evil creatures,
with the advantage constantly shifting from one side of
the fight to the other.  My first view of the rocky
citadel of Crushbone, flanked by giant bonfires, and being
told that an *entire city* of even more powerful orcs
lay waiting, complete with a castle and Emperor.

Smile.
