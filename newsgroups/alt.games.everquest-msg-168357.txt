That's perfectly normal for raids.  The last number on the lag bar is the
data rate.  Make sure you have filters on for things you don't care about,
and turn on server-side filtering.  Also check your datarate.txt or rate.txt
or whatever the file is named (I don't recall...look in your EQ directory,
and then search the net for that filename to find out what the settings in
it mean).
