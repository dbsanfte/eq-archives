I have done most of my 50 levels of play as a ranger solo. Ever since Ihit
level 10 the warnings have been issued that in 5 levels time Im gonna be
unable to play due to not being able to solo. Basically you can solo
reasonably well up to the point you can fear kite at which point it
becomes trivial. Can't comment on serious planes stuff but there are
animals to fearkite in the 50s certainly.
