I'm trying to dig up a caster disguise for my HEF rogue, just for fun
(=cheaply).

The only suggestions I've come up with so far are:

Eye of Melnor (for that Ice Cream cone effect).  5 wis, 25 charges of
Identify, so there's a lot more common/cheaper items out there and I should
be able to get it at a good price *if* I can find it at all.

Guardian's Robe, Skyshrine drop.  Rarity seems to be in question but it's
all/all and I've seen screenshots of non-casters wearing it.

Testament of Vanear, got my butt parked already at Dylin's camp in Highpass.


I've already got a doll and stein for when I do my HEF-in-chainmail Druid
disguise.  For the robe, btw, I do realize that I'll need to be using my DE
illusion to get the robe's graphic.
