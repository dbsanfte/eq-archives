Yup, all the "baby" elementals are there strictly as DC targets.  They're the
only greens in the zone, and they're very wimpy compared to the rest of the
zone.  Note that the DC pets are different targets than the ones that are
"worthwhile" to charm.  A max buffed DC pet won't hold a candle to an unbuffed
big elemental in that zone.  But it also won't smash you to paste when it
breaks.

It'd be a fine experiment to see how much the 25 minutes of burnout matters.
My suspicion is that it's only slightly better than Vallon (85% haste for
BO, 68% for Vallon, Vallon has more ATK and better stats).  

To try it out in a zone where DC pets are equivalent to normal mobs, you could
try a golem in Old Sebilis - I think they're elementals, but I'm not certain.
Go farm some gems and alchemy components and run some DPS tests.
