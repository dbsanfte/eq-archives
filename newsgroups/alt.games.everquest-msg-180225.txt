"Chash"? Do you mean "cache"? I'm pretty sure that a 1MHz chip would not 
be  able to pull it's own weight in my kid's Scooby Doo digital watch. A 
P3/1GHz CPU, on the other hand, that clocked at 940MHz, would be sold as 
a P3/933MHz, I'm pretty sure. That "chash" is way too expensive to be 
"burned" and wasted just so it can be sold in a much less expensive 
processor.
