You think Kaladim and the Butcherblock Mts. is a difficult starting city?
I'm curious to know your reasoning why?

Just for the record:
My first character is a dwf warrior. I know.. pretty simple PC but what the
hey.. someone's gotta tank... I found BB to be an excellent starting zone
because 1) the critters right outside the gate of Kaladim are plentiful, 2)
the guards are like RIGHT THERE for protection, 3) progressing from
spiderlings and bats to goblins is nice and easy, 4) the connecting zones
offer more exp than BB and they're not too far away (Unrest, DC, GF, etc.).

This was not meant as a flame by any means, just curious as to your reason.
