    As video games with combat in them go, EQ is perhaps the tamest. No
fountains of blood or heaps of gore while fighting, players and mobs just
yelp a little when hit and wince. When something dies it falls to the ground
with nary an entrail to be seen. It's also not bad for cursing, if you leave
the bad language filter on (and Junior doesn't know how to turn it off). I'm
not saying it's an appropriate babysitter, but it does have some nice
child-friendly features. Compare it to some of the other popular video games
out there some time.
