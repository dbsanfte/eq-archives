It was a good place for me to do some soloing with my shaman as well.  I
usually went to the south side of KC, as everybody hangs out on the north
side, and at the ruins.  Through dinging 53, it was a decent spot for some
fairly easy root and rot soloing.  I did not spend a lot of time there doing
that, as I have spent most of the past 10 or 20 levels grouping.
