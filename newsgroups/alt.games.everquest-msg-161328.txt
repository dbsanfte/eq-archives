Its possible that he's playing the "Dan Qayle" card, but I'm not seeing it.

I'll say this, he "appears" to be an imbecile.  Maybe its a cunning plan to get
the rest of the world to stop taking the US seriously.

I'll also do this.  Show me by a count of hands, non american citizens in this
newsgroup who have the impression that Bush is one bright boy, I'll even accept
a plurality.

Every day, every speech, every shot I see of the guy, he looks worse than he did
the  day before.  As I said elsewhere in this thread, he did indeed look his
best briefly after the 9/11 incedent.. but even then, paled in comparison to a
mayor and a governor involved in the same incedent.  Even on that dreadful day,
I protested that he was allowing his handlers to put him where he was safe,
instead of insisting on being the figurehead this country needs and deserves on
its worst days.  It took him forever to come out from under his hiding place and
make a statement, then he "bravely" walked from the air force one chopper in one
of the most obviously pandering gestures ever made.

From the high point of his presidency, the next week or so where he actually
demonstrated some palpable emotion and resolve, the lad has sunk deeper and
deeper into a mire of misstatements, botched readings of scripts, and sheer
boorishness.

While you may say "thats just his public face, he's bad at that (or playing the
fool deliberately)" and his smarts are showing up behind the scenes, you'll have
hard time proving to me that any "above average intellect" displayed in any
behind the scenes activities are in reality due to his own talents, rather than
that of his handlers.

Tell me that Dick Cheny, secret president, is proving pretty savvy, and I'll
give you a lot more credit.

Rumsfeld, Powell, definately, observably clever people, getting their jobs done
quite handily (whether I agree with their policies or not)

But Bush Junior?  If he's got the street smarts, book smarts, or even emotional
smarts of ANY president in the past 50 years, I'll eat my hat (thats a Truman
reference)

Lance

ps: I'm not a democrat, if that helps, I voted against Clinton the first time
around because he was clearly slime.  I voted FOR him the second time because I
realized that although he was slime, he was indeed a fine president... although
if Dole had acted himself instead of the wooden autonamoton his handlers cast
him as, I'd likely have voted for him instead.  As for Bush vs Gore... I'm
afraid there were exactly zero worthwhile candidates on the ballot that time
around, including "not a ghost of a chance" Nader.
