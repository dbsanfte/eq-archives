I disagree, I thought both planes sucked for exp (if it doesn't at least
match my solo exp in Velk then it isnt worth while)

I also did it at a much faster pace then it sounds you did - me and 1 friend
had total exp in the zone, with 30 people killing the mobs for us (60monk
and 59wiz, 60 rogue and 57 cleric = total exp on a low level plane raid)  it
also included demis

solo velk exp > pof/poh..
