>Then don't participate in them. There are plenty of unaffected zones.

I completely agree.  I had a great time during the events and am glad they
happened.  I upgraded a few of my ranger pieces (lvl34) and got great loot.
If the events had not been repeating it would have been a sad situation
because there were many times an event start and some jerk decided to end
the fun for all and either kill the high priest (nro), werewolf overlord
(wc), or complete the quest (ek) and ruin the fun for everyone.  To me it
was hard enough waiting the 3 hrs for the events to start over except in rm
where it was a continual slaughter!  Anyways, congrats Verant on running
some great events (maybe next time don't allow them to end so soon).
