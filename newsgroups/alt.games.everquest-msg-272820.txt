Hey, I'd settle for "get skillup" if they met the first requirement,
especially with high-ish trivials.  I've started my push for GM tailor
and was researching what new recipes have become available since I
first checked into it.  Hm, Muramite Needle, triv 202, uses just some
bone chips and Muramite Residue . . . but good luck getting any of that
unless you're level 65+.  At least its droppable so you can buy it in
the bazaar if you're rich enough.

Don't be silly!  I've been doing acrylia studded masks recently too,
and I did it sitting next to my Tribute Master.  Those masks turn in
for 7 tribute each.  Not great, but it adds up, and it sure beats
having it rot.
