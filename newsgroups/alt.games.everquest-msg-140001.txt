Trouble is, your epic dot wears off, root breaks, and mob is moving
on you at full speed.  Normal druid snare lasts around 10 minutes, few
mobs live to see a second cast of this, but the epic snare wears off
a couple times a fight if you aren't pouring lots of mana in to make
the battle go more quickly.  Epic proc also has a long cast time,
so that clicking it as a response to it wearing off isn't a very good option,
so you end up casting snare, then overwriting it with epic.

I can't actually think of any reason I'd WANT the snare part of
the leafblower proc to overwrite other snares... unless thats the
only way that you get to keep the free dot.

You might actually find it harder with epic.  At any rate, I'm fairly certain
you'll be casting Snare or Ensnare at some point during the battle and
muttering to yourself about how you wish the leafblower proc was JUST
a big free DOT instead of a DOT/snare.   Don't get me wrong, the
fact that its a big free DOT that stacks with all your others means you'll
cast it anyway and be glad of it... but the Snare part is a pain.  Much
better if it was Ensnare length, or if Ensnare etc would stack with it
so either snare would work if in effect.
