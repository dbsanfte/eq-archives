Another example is the Druid/Ranger DoT line.  If I recall correctly,
the fire-based DoTs also debuff the mob's resists.  I believe it used
to be that you could only have one of these on a mob at a time, even
from different druids or rangers.  The change people were talking
about is that they thought it was unfair that a second Druid (not
really a Ranger since their DoT's are too behind their level) would be
of limited use because of this, so allowed them to stack, at least
between different characters.  Anyone confirm all this or tell me I'm
a complete idiot?
