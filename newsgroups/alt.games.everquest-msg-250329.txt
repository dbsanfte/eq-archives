I suspect you actually think that most of the marketers or SOE execs
have brains.

If you read some of the reports from the gab fest you will know that
very few of the SOE employees actually talk. In fact some of the lower
ones are afraid to put up suggestions (that is what the reports say).

Of course they have some to the conclusion they are loosing money.
That is the single thing that pushed them into trying to get OoW out
early ... they were loosing money through players leaving .. the SOE
brain remnants then saw a business decision was necessary to claw back
some money and hopefully retain players ... that really shows how
bright that bunch are.

That said I actually approve of the polls ... it is the best form of
communication they have come up with yet.  of course they situate the
appreciation before they do it and we never see the results but at
least it is communication with all the player base.  A genuine company
would take notice of the needs and wants of their client base ... will
never be convinced SOE would do that though.
