They didn't have to cure silence, because the clerics (and other casters)
were all kept out of AE range.  Melee over here, casters waaaay over there.
Whenever a melee got down to 45% HP or so, he'd back off and run over to the
aid station.  Nukers would try and time the silence, run in, nuke, run out,
and if they get hit, healers back at the aid station were set up with cancel
magic to remove it so they could try again.

I dunno what the bards were doing... we only have two, other than my alt, and
niether of them speaks english very well, we tend to treat them as "black
box" operations.  The bards do whatever it is bards do, gee things go better
with them around, but sometimes its hard to tell why.  This means that
bringing up my alt I've been largely untutored, which has been fun in its own
way, I'm twinked with knowledge about the game in general, but still have to
explore and experiment to learn my class.

In a previous discussion in this newsgroup, someone said something along the
lines of "bards make this really easy if you know the strategy" but then
refused to elaborate.  Other than that, I don't recall a single mention of
bard vs silence strategy.

We've only recently started doing POG, skipped it back in the days when most
of the junk would have been upgrades (you know, guilds which clear the "junk"
and leave the minibosses or even just Tunare standing), so its only now we
are hitting some of the guys in there.  Two silencer mobs, Ali and one of the
two Guardians.   Hmm, I also went along with another guild once doing WW
dragons, at least one of those silenced, and we used a similar "aid station"
strategy on him.  Apparantly the silence removing via bard song plan is
either not well known or not much implemented (then again, there aren't many
bards on Morell Thule, maybe people know the plan but don't get to use it
much)
