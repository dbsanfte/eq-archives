Have you ever noticed that people in the busy hallways/malls 
spontaneously self-organize to form forward/backwards left/right lanes). 
  Around here its usually on the right (probably mirroring the way were 
taught to drive here), but even so sometimes its on the left. (Anyone in 
the UK notice how it usually self-organizes there?)

Then you've got 'that guy' who fails or refuses to see the advantage of 
going with the flow. He marches through the oncoming traffic, disrupting 
everybody, breaking through families and couples, causing hassles for 
the stroller pushing parents... what do you think of that guy??

Most people in the crowd think he's a clueless moron... and that's 
probably being generous.

Clearly when walking down any empty hall there is no 'better' side. But 
when traffic reaches a critical mass and has self organized into a flow, 
going against the flow is counterproductive at best, and possibly 
clueless or ill mannered on top of that.

Why be 'that guy'?

Just wanted to clarify that I said 'suck-it-up' not suck up. Worlds of 
difference there. I would never suggest some one suck up.
