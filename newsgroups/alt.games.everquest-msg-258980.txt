Ug, no.   We had that for a long while, it was pretty bad.

I much prefer it this way, so we can discuss things without a constant
barrage of posts titled "BRAD PLZ READ!!!!!"  which were always class
balance whining of one form or another, or "Can my character have
'stupidly_overpowered_skill_or_ability_01' plz plz plz?"

Hopefully if any Devs do read here, and / or post here, they would be smart
enough to do so anonymously.
