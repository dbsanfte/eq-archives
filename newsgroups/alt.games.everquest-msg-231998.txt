Ok, let's see a citation to legal precedent. I'll remind you, we're not
talking about regulated or emergency services and products, we're talking
simply about one person choosing to sell a totally discretionary

citation that backs up your naked assertion that this is considered wrong by
the Anglo-American system of common law.

"Must" according to whom? I look forward to your attempts to provide a
citation for this completely unsupportable opinion.
