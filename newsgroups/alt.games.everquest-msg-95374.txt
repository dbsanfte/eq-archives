Ok, so the fire does 60% of the earth, it's still a MUCH more 
group-friendly pet.  I rarely see mage pets take aggro post-50, so 
wouldn't the reduced damage be more useful than the extra HPs and annoying 
roots?

What pet is the epic?  I honestly can't remember, though we have several 
epic mages.  Also, how do the monster summoning pets compare to regular 
pets?  I know that in certain zones where mages use pets they seem to use 
these ones a lot, especially in Chardok for some reason.
