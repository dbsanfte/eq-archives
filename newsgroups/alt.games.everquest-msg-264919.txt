I was in Steamfront last night with my lvl 9 Bard and they were spawing near 
the PoK book too.  They were all 6 - 12 that I saw and after the first "zone 
in" and overwhelmed death, I levekld him up quite nicely there.  Easy escape 
when more than 4 would pop on me.

No great drops from these, but nice xp when I was just using the zone to get 
to CB.  (I know there is a book in GF but I would rather run that distance 
there than in Plane of Knowledge.  I hate the lag in PoK)

Ben on Nameless
