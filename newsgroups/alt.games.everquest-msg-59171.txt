OK, maybe its because I play a rogue and am always facing the opposite of
the group, but why can't we say "train north, Rez south" .   That way you
don't get all screwed up if you coming or going.  I have been playing in KC
the past few days and I still get a chuckle and a fright when I see "TRAIN,
zoning left!" and here comes a group on the run.  Well, half the group runs
left, and the rest run right, and maybe one idiot runs most of the way to
the right, sees his blunder and then TURNS AROUND and runs left.  JEEZ!

I wish you could drag corpses for a short distance without consent.  I would
build a corpse wall around the right zone so there would be a place to med,
wait and zone in safely.
