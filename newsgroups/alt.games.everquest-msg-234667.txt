is the pet proc I use.  Notice there is no knock back.

A single beastlord punching and kicking produces exactly the
same push as a warder and water pet combined.

I'm sorry, but it's simply not true that BL pets push more
than melee or air pets or necro pets.  They push more than
post 50 water pets, but that's because post 50 water pets
generate almost no push.
