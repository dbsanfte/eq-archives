Mages and Wizards can send their 'eye' pets through this door, opening it.
Don't let any of them say it's been fixed or nerfed, it works.  So just
keep shouting at them until they do it.

Sucky loot - we got some kind of meat drop, can't recall what it was
called, didn't even have the tradeskill tag on it.

Our leet necro turned them into bonechips since she'd forgotten to bring
her own.

We dropped Milk (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=61011) and Cookies
(http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=61011) and that slowed him down
long enough for our rangers to WS, die, get rezzed and then arrow-kite him
using the new /autofire feature.  Apparently if you use Magic Cookies
(http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=19732) he just floats off.  He
doesn't summon, and his AoE 'hearty laugh' wasn't anywhere near as bad as
we'd been told.

If you get any body part drops from the elves you can make Pickles
(http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=12235) which work well.

We got some jigsaw puzzle quest drops which we're taking to PoM to see if
they're any use there, one starter alchemy kit and the bike drop (Bike went
to the Warrior MT who always complains about SK's and PAL's getting their
own AA mounts).
