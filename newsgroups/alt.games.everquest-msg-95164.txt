True story...
Picture the scene... FV server has just gone live and is less than an hour
old. Gfay has about 70 Woodelves all below level 3. Your newbie Ranger is
stuck on lvl 1 for 30 minutes because he can't hit anything on the first
swing, and every time he tries for a newbie monster, some bard runs past
with Chords running and snatches everything out from under you. Of the first
10 chars to hit level 4, 8 were bards, 1 druid and 1 HE Cleric working
Felwithe entrance.

Okay, that's an extreme example... but it WAS damn frustrating. Sometimes
even wandering spawns are hard to find ;o)
