Hit MM Necro's rule there. Did a few missions yesterday with a group that
was 65 Ranger (me puller) 65 Druid (main healer) 65 Pal (MT) 63 SK (addtank)
a 65 BL (slows buffs and dps) and a 65 Necro (mez slow debuff dps twitch add
tank ect.)
Was a great groups destroyed a collect with like half an hour to spare even
took an assasin mission with only one death and like 4 adds (kind of sucked
for me ended up rooted with 3 mobs between me and the boss so my bow was
useless. just kept spamming Chloro's about.)
Was funny when we were forming the group people kept asking about Bards and
Enchanter stuff and the necro kept saying. "I can do that'... "I can do that
too".
