The moral standard of prison inmates is very fucked up indeed. Rapists 
are given a tough time, if they went and raped someone else's wife or 
daughter (as in, messing with someone else's property), but someone who 
kills his own wife gets respect.

Prison morality is a bit of an oximoron, to be frank.
