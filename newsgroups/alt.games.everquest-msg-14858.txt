The fact that the original policy wasn't well worded / thought out (or
whether is still needs work) has nothing to do with my question.

And thank you for being so demeaning when presented with the word
"please".

Now, could anyone please answer the question that I asked?  

Let me put it this way:
The issue was whether or not one should report a stolen account
knowing what Verant's policy is/was.

If your account is in the hands of a hacker, should you:

a)  Say nothing and start guessing what password the hacker switched
to in the vain hopes to get your account back, only to give up and
cancel the subscription/stop payments, after which you either give up
playing or go buy another EQ account.

b)  Report the incident, then either give up playing or go buy another
EQ account.

To report it or not to report it.  THAT was the issue being discussed.
