Well I have a 34 BL and he tanks and solos just fine!! Have even
solo'd yellows.. not easy  I grant you and usually leaves me almost
dead and OOM.

But my BL is slightly twinked and a has a few decent pieces of armor.
His ac is around 700 and wis is 140, HP's are kind of low tho.. only
around 900.

Basically a BL is part monk (without the fancy moves and FD) and a
toned down shaman
