Play what you think you will enjoy.  Most classes are less needed these 
days than they used to be.  I took my cleric and enchanter around for 
hours and couldn't get a group.  But enchanters are still just as 
fascinating as ever.  There is a rumor that enchanters may get to run 
fast at 44.

You could also consider a necro.  They have some small heals and at very 
high levels get to do the sacrifice res thing.  They can be wonderful in 
small groups if properly played.
