Well.  I am a programmer and what I know is this.  If you rearrange the
structure in which data is saved, such as records within a file, then there
has -got- to be some coding changes.  They may not be client side (which I
am assuming its that type of "coding" Verant is referring) but there will be
server side code.

For those on this OMG Are characters going to be "ported"... answer is most
likely YES.  I would see no other reason for Verant to -finally-
overhaul/reorganize the manner in which data is saved.  In fact, I wouldnt
be surprised if they will add a few more fields to the ole records in those
data files (nil variables for now of course) -just- for the new EQ2.
<shrug>  Tough to say, but, if "porting" is what Verant -does- want to
offer, implementing such possibilities now would be their smart move.
