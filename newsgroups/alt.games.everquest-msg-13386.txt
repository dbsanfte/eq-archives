BUT...if the GM admitted to standing there watching them do this...wouldn't
it have been more fruitful to say "hey guys...don't do that or I'll have to
ban you" instead of waiting till it was all over and without

I think Verant screwed up in this case...even if these guys did exploit a
bug...it was handled very poorly on Verants end and now they just look
foolish.
