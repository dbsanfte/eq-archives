As a shaman that was soloing a lot, I actively tried to specialize in
Evocation, I put 15 training points in it, and one in each of the others.
Cannibalize is Alteration based.  Even soloing, the single spell I cast by
far the most is Cannibalize, which uses no mana at all.  Oh well, now I
mostly group, and I do cast a lot of buffs, and, it does save me mana on my
heals.  When soloing now, I find that I heal my pet a fair amount anyway, so
it worked out for the best, despite my misguided efforts.
