My partner and I were playing in Unrest yesterday.  Read all the info from
Allakhazam and got map from eqatlas.  Partner waited outside on left wall while
I brought monsters out one at a time and we'd kill.  Right away made the
mistake of casting on a ghoul down the first hall to the right.. pulled that
Toklar Battlemaster guy too.  He conned blue!!!... kicked our butts right ...
we're shouting TRAIN! TRAIN!  - we died - ... learned a lesson.
NEVER went down *his* hall again or pulled anything anywhere near him.  No
problem.
Ok so an hour or so goes by.  A group comes in and stays on the right wall.  No
problem.  Pretty soon we notice they had pulled that nasty toklar and were
getting their butts kicked.  Ran over.. kept them healed up till they got it
killed.  They said thanks.  We went back to our own side.
Pretty soon their leader pulls the thing AGAIN.  This time she sends me a TELL:
 "Thanks so much for training toklar on us..."  HELLO????  I send her a TELL:
"sorry but I think you are mistaken.  I didnt go near him."  
She TELLS me back "bullshit... saw you run out before me and he trained on ME!"
Ok, I can handle her cussing at me.  So I TELL her again..."I am only pulling
from the front of the left corridor.  I stay away from Toklar and everything on
the right  side because of him...."  
She doesn't respond.  A few minutes later one of her now dead party members
TELLS me what an ass I am for getting him killed.  Now I *saw* her pulling
stuff from the right corridor and I ASSUME she doesn't realize how far his agro
is but thats neither here nor there.  My question is this:
How do you deal with people that accuse you when you are innocent and how much
effort do you spend trying to "play nice"?  I couldn't TELL her whole group the
situation.. so I have to assume they all blamed ME.  I thought about marching
over and just SAYING that it wasn't me but there were a bunch of them and two
of us and I figured it would just start an argument.  I know I shouldn't care
but I DO.
