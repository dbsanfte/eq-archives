Dan tested it on various characters of different level, STA, and swim
skill. Tiru and I tested it on characters of the same value in those
things, but threw in an Iksar to test the racial thing. Swim skill
affects how fast you can swim, and at very high levels, allows you a bit
more mobility (move backwards a bit, etc.) but nothing to do with "Time
to Drowning". STA, on the other hand, has a HUGE impact on TtD. You
could nearly double your air supply time with a significantly higher
STA.

Iksars are the fly in the ointment. Even with base stamina and starting
swim skill, (what do they get? 50? 100?) they can hold their breath
longer than most anyone else.
