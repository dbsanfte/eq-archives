I have to side with those here who say the cleric *does* owe a rez.

Clerics are invited to a typical exp group for two things: heals and
rezzes. Take away either one and you reduce the usefulness of the
cleric enormously. A 0% rez will not only be punishing the person
being rezzed at the 50+ levels. The person being rezzed will quite
rightly turn it down and get a rez elsewhere. Waiting for the new rez
will chew up the group's time.

If all you want is a healer... a 58+ shaman is in some ways a better healer
than a cleric. They get something close to CH, plus Canni which lets them
never be out of mana for more than a minute or two. It's not terribly
fair, perhaps, but it's currently true. That leaves the rez spells,
and the OP failed in his responsibilities by failing to rez a groupmate.
If there was that much bad blood, he should have complained or left.
Staying implied he would continue to discharge his responsibilities...
but he did not.

The ninja-looting rogue was an idiot, but I'm afraid the OP one-upped
him by a fair margin.
