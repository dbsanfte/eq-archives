Yup, no high level shamen in the guild, although me will probably have a 
level 53 one joining soon.  I'm the haster and slower at all the "Raids", 
including the 6 Lodizal take-downs we've done recently.  We would probably 
have to tash / root / slow the mobs that re slowable to keep me from dying, 
and get me an Aego for the ones that can't be speed-changed.

I was just looking at those ( I sorted the mobs by level and started 
looking ) and they seem OK, but not the best.  I wouldn't mind the 
webshield, though..

... I've never been to Kael, so maybe the people would like to head there 
instead.

I thought I was going to have a few of these moments last night, but was 
proven wrong.  We were in The Hole and went from 2 mobs to 9-10 in mere 
seconds ( twice ) and throughout the 2+ hours we were there, there was only 
1 broken mez, and it was by a new member and he missed the target switch.  
Our guild is small, but we focus on grouping and raiding skills and having 
fun and the rest just comes naturally.

Strands, btw.  That's why I am avoiding Pick-up groups for a while.  The 
guild groups are always good.  When it turns to clumps, I'll start playing 
single-player wargames again.

Thanks for the post.  I've been wanting to see Kael.
