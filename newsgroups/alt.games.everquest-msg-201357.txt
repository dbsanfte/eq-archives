If I were in your shoes, I'd go ahead and buy the original EverQuest.  I've
seen it as low as $5 at Wal-Mart and it comes with a free month of play.
You won't get many of the nifty benefits of some of the expansions but
you'll definitely get a good feel for the game and you can decide if you
want to keep playing it or not.  I've been hearing mixed responses from
people about whether or not they'll move over to EQ2.  Many players are very
devoted to the original EQ and don't see the need to get the new game.
Others can't wait for that fresh start and impressive graphics of EQ2.
Still, I would think it's worth 5 bucks for a month-long look at the
original.
