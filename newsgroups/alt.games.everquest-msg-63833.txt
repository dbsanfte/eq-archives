If you did add IPX/SPX ( one of the suggestions ), you should remove it.  
In your environment, it is not needed.

It may be to your benefit to not let NetBeui run over IP.  I don't have any 
machines running your OS, so I can't tell you where to look for it.  You 
can probably find this option by going to properties of the NetBeui 
protocol.  Someone will correct me if I am wrong, but I believe if you let 
NetBeui run over IP, then you are opening up yourself to many more 
possibities of getting attacked via the file-sharing service.  Your 
workgroup will be available througout the cable network at the minimum.

It all depends on how you have the network setup, too.  If you are on a 
LinkSys or something similar, then this is moot.  If both of your PCs are 
getting their IP from your cable company, I'd check into this.
