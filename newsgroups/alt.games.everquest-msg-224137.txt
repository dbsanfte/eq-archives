Only spells I announce via hotkey are when a slow lands, and when I am 
casting a big heal.  Other than that, it's just yet more annoying spam.  
If I root a mob, I let the group know, but it's not hotkeyed.  I cast the 
spells with alt-#, except for the gimp CH, which I have a hotkey 
including the group message that I am casting it.
