DS yourself, regen yourself, then just smack the critters over the head 
with anything resembling a weapon (doesn't matter what, the only reason 
for the weapon is to get them hitting you.

Why bother with rooting mobs that are green to a level 9 when you are at 
least 56?  Rather than waste mana like that, use your cheapest aggro 
spell if you want to get them from range or just melee skill if you 
don't mind running in to melee range to "pull".

Also, dont' bother continuing to hit them once you have their attention. 
  Once they are on you, their death is inevitable, and the damage they 
will do is negligible, so spend your time pulling more and looting the 
dead ones.

Oh, and get that pet out if you have it, he's handy for doing trivial 
amounts of melee damage while accepting trivial amounts of melee damage, 
with no mana expenditure needed.

Splendid
