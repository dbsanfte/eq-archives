Hi all,

  I've just now started on my tambourine quest.  Got a coin in LOIO from
vendor (after getting smoked pulling 2 gobbies and 2 barracuda, thank God
for rezzed), now am working towards the next on in Overthere.  I printed a
map, fired up the singing steel boots and selo's and did a little "recon"
this morning of the chasm area...

EEK!!!

It appears that the main 'entrance' to the place is guarded by some nasty
looking red-cons.  The place is deeper than I thought.  I *was* intending on
lev/selo's racing in there, pulling the scrounger, and kiting it to death up
above.

HAHAHAHA!!!  Like that's going to happen!

I'm hoping some wise, kind person on this board can help me with a little
advice, as this area of OT seems a little nasty to say the least.  One other
issue is, it seems that in some areas of the chasm, the edge seemed to act
as a 'wall' and wouldn't let me got close enough to look over the edge.  Is
this correct?
Anyway, the main people I group with are me (45 Bard), a 45 wizzie and 45
druid.  I can scrounge up a couple tanks and a 53 Cleric with a few /tells.
Could the 3 of us feasibly pull this off (I would assume not, but I'm not
experienced in the chasm) or will we need the full group (or more?), is
there a safer way in than by those red-conned nasties, and lastly, is it
possible to pull the ugly scrounger out of the chasm for easier fighting?

TIA for any help in this.  I want me damn tambourine!

Thanks,
SEAN...
