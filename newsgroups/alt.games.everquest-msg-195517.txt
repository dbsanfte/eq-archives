Hmm.... well its more of a Max out your skills for your class each
level..... and then its more when your Level 20 plus or so.

So a caster would want to get their med, abj, con, etc, up to max per
level... oh and dont forget defense... a very good skill for a caster,
whereas yoru 1hb will be practily useless to you as you get older.

A Melee class would want to work on their primary skills, 1hb, 2hb,
1hs, 2hs, Pierce, Off, def etc....
