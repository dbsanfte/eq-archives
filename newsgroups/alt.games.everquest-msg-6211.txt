Not sure about the little boats, but theres some wierd hate list things with
the big boats in OOT

I was on the StormBreaker, headed out to the siren rocks for some hunting,
decided to get off on sister isle, 2 steps onto the dock:

A seafury cyclops hits you for 64 damage
A seafury cyclops hits you for 38 damage
/yell
<rinse and repeat>
<die right next to the other end of the docks>

bleh.
