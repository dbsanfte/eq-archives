Nee, I noticed that '5 aliases' thing in the Fellowship as well! Cool sort
of touch, but yes, hard reading. I've got The Return of the King and will
likely start that tomorrow, but should I get the Silmarrilion (sp?) next?
I've never read that, and it seems like there's a host of other Tolkien
works I didn't even <know> about that I might need to/want to read.
Suggestion? Oh, and a better MAP might be nice... these eyes are bad enough
without all that tiny print! ;) I like to keep track of where all the guys
are :) and are going!

OK, Boromir's brother was Faromir (?) crap, just finished reading the stupid
thing, where did I leave my memory??!! I did not know that Elrond also had a
brother. And that part about Arwen in the movie (gods yes, it was a
beautiful scene), but I couldn't find it anywhere in the Fellowship book. Is
it in another of Tolkien's books, or did I just miss the boat again?

thanks,
Dark
