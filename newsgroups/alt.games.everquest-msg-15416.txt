What is untrue is that killing giants up to ally with coldain will
guarantee you non-KOS status with CoV. The simple fact is that dragon and
dorf factions are NOT RELATED, and you cannot use one to judge your
standing with the other.

Since faction boils down to numbers, it is a very exact science.
Unfortunately, we don't *know* those numbers, so trying to determine one
faction from another is exceedingly difficult, if not outright impossible.

Um, that statement is as factual as it is possible to be.

Fact: We do not know what he has killed
Fact: Killing different things yields different factions

Example: He killed giants up enough to get to dubious with CoV, and Ally
with coldain. He then went to west wastes for a weekend, and is now KOS
with CoV. Then he kills a couple dozen giants. Then he cons a dwarf, and
gets the Ally message. Tell me: What is his CoV faction? I'll answer for
you: There is no way for you to know.
