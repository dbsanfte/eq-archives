In fact it would be dishonest of me not to post this more recent article 
which I located after the previous post:

http://talkreason.org/articles/flagellum.cfm

Apparently people now have some theories that -may- explain it.

In this case neither. I'm not supporting creationism; arguing that 
evolution has conflicts doesn't require arguing -for- creationism.

I honestly beleive evolution, by and large, is right. I would be stunned 
if the whole thing ever got tossed. But there are several challenges 
that evolution doesn't explain (yet). And some of the explanations that 
exist for some phenomena are unsatisfactory, and some of the 
explanations do not invoke -natural selection-.

Wikipedia for example defines evolution:
"Since the emergence of modern genetics in the 1940s, evolution was 
defined more specifically as a change in the frequency of alleles from 
one generation to the next. Evolution's two-stage process involves, 
first, the production and redistribution of genetic variation (see 
Differential survival of traits); and, second, natural selection acting 
on this variation."

As I mention in the other reply, supplanting natural selection with 
additional theories is fine by me, but supplanting natural selection 
with other theories highlights that a phenomena conflicted with natural 
selection, and necessitated a separate theory to explain the 
contradiction.

As soon as you open the door to integrating separate theories to patch 
the holes in natural selection you really ought concede that the theory 
of evolution is inadequate on its own.

And although I'm not really arguing the creationist's side, I think I 
should again point out that there is nothing inconsistent with patching 
a hole in the theory of evolution with an ID theory. But personally, I'd 
rather not, unless it becomes inescapable.
