Not guilty, sorry.
Btw shouldn't this be the other way round?  That bots DONT sit down enough?
Afterall their attention would be elsewhere..

1)  don't exp where others can train you
2)  only pull what you can handle
3)  I can (and do) mez adds whilst 4boxing.  I had a valorium guard charmed
and hasted for something like 4 hours, in HoH, with zero deaths.

Invis dropping isn't an issue.  But yeah, I can be slower to move than
"real" people.  Reason for this is I don't always trust auto follow (and
sometimes it just doesn't work), and I like to err on the side of caution
