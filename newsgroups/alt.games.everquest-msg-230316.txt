Might I suggest a Bogling Mallet for working 1HB. At 6/24 its not 'good' 
by any stretch, but its fast enough, and more importantly its completely 
weightless. I used a Bogling War Spear for Piercing for the same reason.

Being weightless made toting them about a non issue, and I just swapped 
them in whenver we had a mob snared and running, or any of a zillion 
other scenarios where higher dps really isn't a big deal... until I'd 
gotten my 5 points per level.
