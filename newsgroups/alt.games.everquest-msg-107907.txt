Used CS to lvl my warrior to 54 from 51 and go gain a lot of AA points. Just
had my cleric sit there and heal. Single pulled everytime. I even did it at
times where I was the only one in the zone. I pulled over drakes, around
drakes, around the named wyverns etc etc etc. Never ONCE, got an add. I
guess i am just bugged huh? /shrug
