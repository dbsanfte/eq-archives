A few questions please to answer

1. Has any druid yet quad kited any where safely (relatively speaking) in an 
OOW zone?

2. AA points. Im assuming that Dire charm is an AA? if so, should I aim to 
purchase that skill ASAP?

3. Does the druid AA dire Charm only work on animals?

4. Just realised, maybe druids dont get dire charm?

5. If they do, does Dire Charm for druids work same way as ench, in that the 
charm never breaks? Or if it does break,  what stat helps it not break?

6. Finally Im 64 and have 12 AA, unspent. If not spent on Dire Charm, what 
would be best early use of these.

Many questions I know, but always appreciate answers and help.

Thanks
