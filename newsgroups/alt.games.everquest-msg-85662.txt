when naggie up on Mith Marr, there is an immediate mad rush for a pick
up group (30-45 minutes after patch).  It gets wiped out and everyone
gives up. Few stick around and try a second time, they get wiped.
Naggie stays up a few days, few more pick up raids get wiped, then an
official guild raid happens and naggie dies.

Same for vox, except she up for little longer
