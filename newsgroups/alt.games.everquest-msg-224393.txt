I have 3 pc's - all various different spec's but all running windows XP

all were running fine until the patch before last.  Then the older of the
Pc's crashed, about once per day.  A big white box came up saying EQ client
had crashed - do I want to send sony an error report.

This went on for about 1 week, then PC2 had the same problem.

2 weeks later, PC3 is now getting it.

Any ideas ?!

All drivers are up to date.  EQ full patch done, texture files deleted, all
the usual things a GM suggests.

heylp ....
