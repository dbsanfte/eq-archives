Hello all,

First off, I know a lot of folks twink (duh!) but, of late, I have been
seeing some folks running around in better equipment at level10 than you see
on some early to mid 50 level folks.  One of the most common twink
statements/questions I hear is "When will my weapon proc?"...

I started a new Ranger the other day.  First off I noticed right away that
the GFay zone, when there aren't a lot of newbies there, is a real dangerous
place to start a char.  After my 6th time in a row running from orc pawns,
at level 1, I got annoyed, grabbed my 52 Druid and got my new Ranger some
equipment -- decent sword, dwarf tunic, chitin shield, leather leggings,
belt...  Nothing spectacular (my druid is rather well known for soloing the
Rygorr fort -- getting the Chief, etc so I could have done a full suit of
armor but...).

The thing is, I put just enough stuff on him so he could solo a bit with not
many newbies around.  It made advancing levels easier but not to easy (he is
now 8th level and his 1hs skill is level maxed, other skills comming along
nicely).  I've met a good dozen folks around 30th level with almost no
skills.  They did it within 2 weeks.  Why would someone want to build up
levels so fast that they have no skills?

I've seen those same "uber equiped" guys get group after group killed until
no one wants to group with them because they don't know how to play their
chars...  (the I have 5 chars now.  all over 30th level and I have only been
playing 6 months!)..  yeah right...  Now, how many of those 5 chars do you
know how to play with any style???

Sorry, just doesn't make much sense to me so, being as this area has a wide
audience, someone could explain it to me.

TIA
