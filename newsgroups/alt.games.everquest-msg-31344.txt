See, now drinking and playing EQ *really* scares me.  My buddy /tell's me
the other night, after not having been on for a week or 2 - 'hey man! I'm
playing my monk! I'll be in nro trying to get into a derv group and my
girlfriend pissed me off so I got drunk'

I /tell back - 'be careful and don't die and lose your stuff in your
condition!'

*cut to me in EK for the first time, seeing the sights, slaying the
creatures - hanging out with the lions*

he /tell's - 'shit I died - dam mummy - can you help me find my corpse?'

and of course I immediately went to his aid as he was wearing hand me down
twink gear that a good friend who switched servers had given me for my monk,
oh lets see, 2 fighting batons, exe hood, foreman's tunic?  all kinds of
nifty stuff I did *NOT* want him to lose.

Man, friends don't let friends play EQ drunk!

That's an awesome record.  Death is a game within the game for me.  I don't
get pissed when I die because of exp loss (not yet anyway...).  I get more
angry at myself that I was bested and out tacby some damned computer AI -
and not particularly brilliant AI at that.   Hmmph.
