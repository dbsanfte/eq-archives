Ken--

You seem to be under the impression that I'm interested in engaging
you in a dialogue. That impression is incorrect.

However, since it's clear that you are perfectly capable of carrying
on at length with little or no feedback from the people around you, I
would like you to feel free to go ahead and insert whatever
deprecating and/or smarmy comments you think I would make wherever you
need them. While I recognize that these comments will not have the wit
or cleverness of my actual comments, perhaps they will be enough to
get you through the day.
