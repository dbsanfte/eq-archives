You sound like a man with some experience.

Anyway, as I said... it's *possible* that Horizons will be the "EQ killer" 
for me.  I bet on nothing, because I've returned to EQ several times 
before.

Still...  Animal people, good graphics and animations, the ability to 
change classes (schools), prestige schools, crafting that actually *means* 
something, the ability for players to have an actual effect on the world 
they live in...  *No* other MMORPG has grabbed me as strongly as Horizons 
has, or made me want to play EQ less.

Time will tell.
