Anyone remember the greedy beggar mob in Butcherblock Mountains? He
spawns just to the north of the road outside the docks, and if you
give him money (a copper will do) he will become your pet and follow
you around. Do this, drag him all the way to the LDoN camp and watch
the confusion as people who have never seen him before start hailing
him, giving him money and wonder why they can't kill him.

Well, it amused me.
