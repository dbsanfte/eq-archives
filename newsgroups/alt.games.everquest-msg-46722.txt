The "Windowed" view doesn't blow up...never has.  The Full Screen views do
take advantage of the higher resolutions, though (hit F10).

If you have Scars of Velious this shouldn't be a problem most of the
time...they've been working on getting rid of the windowed view altogether
(though they've been slacking for many months now), and SoV has the newest
interface.

Once you go into Full Screen mode you'll probably want to increase your chat
font size, but I forget the command.  It goes from 0 to 5, 5 being the
largest.

If you do /? in game it should give you the slash command there.
