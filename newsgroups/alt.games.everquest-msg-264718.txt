Maybe they're bringing back Rubicite. ;-)

Quick logout from EQ2 to this ominous message:

Evening, Beta2! Your server is going to be restarted in FIVE MINUTES for a 
quick reconfiguration. Please get someplace safe by then. You'll notice some 
zone instancing changes have happened when you return. Downtime should be 
ten minutes total. Thanks!

Speculation is that they are instancing Antonica. This will be a major 
disappointment if true ...
