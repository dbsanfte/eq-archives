Well, the best way to go about this is to hand the items over to a
friend or someone else you can trust, and let them hang onto the item
until you can get back to them with your twink.

However, if none are handy, I often just find a nice unused building
in an out of the way part of town and drop items off there.  Sit and
camp out, while holding the item to be dropped.  When the timer hits
five seconds, drop the bag, log back in with your alt (Who you should
have standing at the exact same spot beforehand, mind you) and pick up
the item.

To ward off jackles, you might want to scout out the building you're
doing the dropoff in for a couple minutes, perhaps dropping "dummy"
items like food or coin in order to thrush out anyone lurking invised
in a corner.

I've never had a problem with anyone stealing my items like this, as
long as you select a nice out of the way corner, you should be fine.
The only real danger lies in getting disconnected in the middle of the
transfer, and having the bag rot before you can get back.
