What i'm saying is that by introducing using something from a 3 year
old expansion.. you also have to construct a reason why it ties in.

Hehe.

Why.. just cuz?

Yeah... but it still adds a lot of lore to try to get them to tie in
together.. and then you are basing the lore on one expansion on the
lore of another.

Yeah.. i've seen some.. but most of the time as you say its just junk
item farming in old expansions.

Not sure if having Epic 1.0 is a requirement.

Like? Most of the problems i saw with people not finishing epics is
simple guild support and the timing on the mob. Bard Trak was always a
killer for a lot of people to get.

On the one hand.. you adhere to the philosophy that the guild and
players work together to build up the gear... but i don't see the
point in not allowing people to group with others. Its a social game.

Pay is better if you do any number of things. Tradekskill item
farming, bazaar selling, etc. Just something as simple as cobalt cod
farming in CS or Wyvern farming in the same zone gets way more money
than RM.

>And easier at what level?

Is CS portal level restricted? If not.. uh.. level 1.

Actually.. LDoN's per hour always tended to make more than RM.
Especially if you ran the ML. The funny part was that people always
obsess over the gems.. fuck that.. you could make 10x the money by
holding the runes and words and dropping an extra 50pp into the split
for what you kept since you weren't going to get much money from the
vendor anyways. In turn.. you could sell certain runes and words for
2-3K each.

>I could be wrong though, perhaps you can name several other routes to 
>better cash that don't require a group,

Well.. LDoN's require a group sure... but bear in mind i played a
warrior as main so i bloody well needed plat sources :>.

>trade skilling

Not tradeskilling per say.. farming tradeksill items.

>, or setting up in the bazzar;

Perma-camping the bazaar can also be lucrative if you know what to
look for, have some upfront capital, and know what prices are good.
