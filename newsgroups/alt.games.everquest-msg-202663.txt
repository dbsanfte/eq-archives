Right, here goes:

a group of peeps, lets say of level 25 go get buffed up to the T...
KEI, Virtue, PoTG (for the casters), FOS... etc...   now this group
heads to a zone that is beyond their range of skills without those
buffs.  They then take over several spawns/camps and monopolize the
area that used to support 2 or 3 groups of a higher level previously.

so now, others cannot hunt in the good ole hunting grounds because of
the ONE group.

ok lets take it to somethign you may understand because of your FAST
play style.

Take similar group buffed to the T but make em lets say level 12 - 15
and Put em in Pauldner (the speed level zone.)  That group could
monopolize both camps of bandits if there was no one else in zone...
and they are at camps for about their level... now they have the down
time of waiting on spawns... hmm odd they are sitting and talking
while waiting on spawns not mana.

In that instance your group was not affecting anyone...   now add a
couple of other groups in that zone...  The story "may" be different.
Now, look at more populated zones... 

you can keep describing under used zones where this issue would not
affect them, but many others would be affected.   So, should they make
the zone strip off all high end buffs for zones that would be
affected?   nope,  They fixed the KEI/Aego/etc, to the way it was
Intended and still is intended.
