Hello All,

I was wondering if I could get some feedback from the group about a program 
I'm in the process of coding. I'm writing a Everquest character .opt file 
editor and was wondering if there would be any interest in such a program. 
As it stands right now I'm just writing it for my own benefit, however if 
there is a demand for it I'd be willing to put more effort into it. That 
said, it would be available for free, the same as my ini file editor. So 
would anyone find something like this useful?
