I would start off at http://www.castersrealm.com/  and go to the Clerics section.
There will be lots of information on the equipment you will want, quests, and
strategy guides for clerics.  I *think* there may also be discussion fora there
where you can exchange notes with other clerics.

What were you doing at the time? Could you have inadvertently done/said something
to offend one of the other players?  If not, you may have either just run into a
reall asshole, or, somebody who just enjoys dueling for the fun of it and wanted
to see if you wished to engage them.
