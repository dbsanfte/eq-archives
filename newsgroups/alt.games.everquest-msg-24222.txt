No, but the difference between level 52 and level 55 (where they DO
hunt Juggs) is 3 weeks.

It'll probably take more than 3 weeks of constantly farming Fear/Hate
to get a full set, hell even just the BP (unless you're a cleric in
which case Hate is freaking candyland).

Furthermore, if armor is what you want, Velious offers *BETTER* armor
for less time and fewer people.

You want to bring 30+ people to Fear for armor drops?  How about 12
people to Kael Arena?  Drop rates will be on par and you get armor
that's significantly better in terms of stats (if not looks).

If the target is the boss mob, you don't have to kill ToV trash along
the way.  You use a non-KOS CoV mage mule to CoH everyone to the boss
mob.  

For those huntin HoT and Dozekar, you kill two freaking wurms and
you're there.  Wow!  That's really involved.

Infact, the only place we've raided so far where shamans have shown to
be extremely useful is Sleeper's Tomb.  But this is a zone that can be
99% cleared with 25 people or less (the final warder being a REAL
bitch).  For that, we need 1 shaman.  Two would be redundant and only
there to make the "buffing" cycle go a bit faster.
