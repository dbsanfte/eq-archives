Posted by Dowel_Fearn Yesterday at 06:29 PM - 1 comment 
Yes folks, Eqcleric is PROUD to have our first ever Member-driven EQ 
Writting Contest. All hail Numo for this fantastic idea and a large pat on 
the back to those who have already submitted entries. Looks like we have 
some great writters out there as all submissions thus far are well done! 
Lets see a lot more before the contest closes!

Please see Original Contest Thread for rules and details.

Enjoy! I think your writting would be a shoe-in ;)

'You're not friends. You'll never be friends. You'll be in love till it 
kills you both. You'll fight, and you'll shag, and you'll hate each other 
till it makes you quiver, but you'll never be friends. Love isn't brains, 
children, it's blood... blood screaming inside you to work its will. I may 
be love's bitch, but at least I'm man enough to admit it.'
