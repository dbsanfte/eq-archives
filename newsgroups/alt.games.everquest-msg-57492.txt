Limiting it to "certain zones" or "certain servers", or even to "certain
times" etc etc is just going to create a botleneck during the right
conditions... exactly as happened this week. If the monsters were spread out
more, it would be less of a problem imo.

I doubt if many want PC monsters on their own server tho. Nice to play
monsters, but not so nice when youre on the receiving end. I can see them
setting up a couple of "monster" servers where (like one of the pvp servers)
xp from death is halved, and of course you have to deal with the PC
monsters, and they will leave the existing servers along.
