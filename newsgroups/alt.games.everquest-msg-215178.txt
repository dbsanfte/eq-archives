Entirely incorrectly even... 'crack' is the actual term. And despite the 
urban legends about 'elite godly computer hackers' 'cracking' nasa, the 
military, the powergrids etc... the vast majority of security 
compromises are the result of guessing passwords, or tricking someone 
into disclosing them. Hardly a glorious accomplishment.

1) too many people use their username=chatname or character name.
2) too many people use really stupid passwords.

Guessing a particular somebodies account might be nearly impossible... 
but with 450,000 subscribers... guessing 'somebodies' account isn't that 
unlikely.
