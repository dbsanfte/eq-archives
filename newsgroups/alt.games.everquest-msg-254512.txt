Ok, a silly cosmetic question here.  I've been playing with a little ranger
twink with the intention of him using 2 Steel-laced aged snake whips.  In
the first few levels, with every swing, the full whip animation was
happening, which looks awesome.  Later on though, I suppose as hits
connected with more frequency, only the first swing per mob had the full
animation - all the rest show me hitting with a crappy little triangle.  I
can make the animation show by unequipping and equipping the whip real fast.

Same thing happen for anyone else who has tried weilding a whip?
