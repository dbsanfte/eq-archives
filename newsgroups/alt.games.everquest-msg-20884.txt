Wintersboo is a combination of which two words?

Besides, you're ALLOWED to have compound words as either a given or surname:

Taken from Da Rules:

11. Names that contain sentences (Ikillorcs), phrases (Ontop), or two or
more words that do not form descriptive compound words (Petcarbob, Diediedie
and Tablechair). *** Descriptive compound words are allowed in first names
and are encouraged in surnames (e.g. Treehugger, Giantslayer).  ***
Descriptive compound words (each separate part of the word and the entire
word) must otherwise adhere to all other naming rules
