Possibly, but then why use Virtual PC?? Emulation of the simple 
processor is easy to do, as you noted; where VPC has value is in its 
support for virtualized disk devices, virtualized BIOS system support, 
and virtualized graphics hardware (a 4MB S3), such that an application 
can call that virtual BIOS, and write directly to the virtual video 
card.... none of this value is leveraged in the XBOX apps which should 
all adhere to the Windows2k HAL+API structure.

An XBOX virtualization project shouldn't need anything VPC does. A 
simple P3 cpu emulator, and a trap to bridge with Windows 2000 (ish) API 
calls to the native cpu compiled APIs is all that's required.  VPC is 
completely the wrong virtualization tool for the job.

I stand by my assertion that its purchase was to give IT admins the 
world over a solution to allow them to upgrade NT4 and 2K servers with 
legacy applications.

Right now, an IT admin looks at 2k3 and says yeah theres a lot it will 
do that I want, but I need gauranteed legacy support for every app in 
the software inventory, and I need it to work from day one. VPC server 
is that bridge application, you can upgrade to 2k3, and run NT4 in a 
virtual environment which will support your legacy requirements. Without 
this solution migration to new MS products is being slowed, the 
licensing of which is naturally MS's primary source of revenue.
