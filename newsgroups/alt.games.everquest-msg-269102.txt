My group over its levelling history has regularly tried to take out 
named mobs while they are still even/yellow to us, and this often means 
pacifying and single pulling mobs around it because we'll get the whole 
crowd and wipe if we don't.

It is a common enough occurence that someone (or even a group) higher 
level will walk in destroy the named and leave (because at their level 
they don't get the adds and/or can ignore them.)

This has happened in many places: King and Muggle in Warrens, The named 
mushroom in PC, the named mushroom in EC (actually timelocked on this 
one... same guy logged in nuked it while we fought the guys right in 
front of him and logged out... came back 3 hours later and did the same 
thing, and then 3 hours after that too... in each case we were right 
there clearing the nearby mobs to give our healers and nukers a place to 
stand out of range of his AEs etc for the fight.)

Also... Xalgoz in Kaesora, Mighty Golem in CoM, Ferocious Turepta in 
Natimbi (we were camping the beach and had killed all the mites and 
tureptas there for a couple hours, there was never more than one 
unengaged mob alive on the beach... the ferocious popped just as we were 
finishing off a mite, I forget what in Mistmoore, something on the 4th 
or 5th floor of ToFS, the Spider Queen in CC, as well as 'spawned 
special but not named mobs' like Couriers in LOIO where we'd be running 
the circuit with our own tracker to spawn them, and someone (trackers 
invariably) would zip in snag it, and leave (lost at least one G.Ring to 
that... the guy ooc'd how happy he was to get it.)


These are -all- cases where we were right there in plain view of the mob 
we were trying to get to, but couldn't engage him just yet due to 
downtime (low health mana) or still dealing with one of its 'gaurds'.

As far as having people clear entire zones (or the entire part of the 
zone where I *can* hunt where I'm hunting before they arrive? Its 
happened to me in Kurns Tower on multiple occasions (once it was an SK 
who wanted bonechips, other times it was PL groups) the Warrens multiple 
times (factioning), the Yard in Unrest (he wanted Zombie skins), the 
beach in Gunthak (kiting), CoM entrance (PLing), KC entrance (PLing), HS 
entrance (PLing), GE entrance (PLing), Natimbi (PLing) as well as a few 
PoP zones like PoI etc.

I'm not even going to mention the cyclopses, CC geonids, rathe giants or 
PC bandits.

Some of the KSes were blatant, some were fairly unintentional. The PL 
groups (I say group... but it was usually a duo of a 65 and a lowbie at 
the dungeon entrances made the zone unplayable for any group that 
couldn't establish themselves much deeper within the zone well away from 
conflicting with the PLer, where the mobs are tougher, and escape 
options diminished... and god forbid you train the entrance!!

Also none of them we in violation of the 'rules'. Overall, it hasn't 
been a bad experience. But I wouldn't miss it if they 'fixed' it. EQ2 
has the potential to fix much of it.
