Are they the same mobs?  Mob level and MR apply to every resist
check to break root.  And most roots are checked for break every
tick (6 seconds).



> DD spells definitely break it far more frequently.

DD's give an immediate resist check, apparantly with a modifier
based on the amount of damage done.  The mob's (or PC's) current
MR is also a mod to the resist (big surprise, I know).  With Kaev
I saw a lot of melee vs. rooted mobs.  I spent a huge amount of
time solo in LGuk, where Instrument of Nife (243dd buff proc)
would usually break root on a dark blue con mob, and root basicly
didn't break if I didn't proc.  I was doing nearly all my damage
with melee, and my roots didn't break unless I proc'd.  I also
spent time solo in JP, fighting the gnolls there.  I didn't have
a proc'ing weapon and I never got the L49 self buff that procs
(IoN is vs. undead only), and my roots broke no more frequently
while meleeing than while sitting to regen/med during a close
fight.  And nowadays, as I mentioned before, my Druid does not
see his roots breaking during melee unless he procs or the mob
is of a level/MR to break early anyway.  In my experience there
is no effect at all on root duration from pure melee damage, and
I've spent a lot of time bashing on a lot of rooted mobs.
