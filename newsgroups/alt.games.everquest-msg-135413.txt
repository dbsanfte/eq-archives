Yep, they're mine.  Still not setting you up for ridicule.  Still just
trying to get one of those '"clear statements" you claim to make.  Have no
desire to ridicule you, or have others do so.  Still just interested in
having an actual discourse in which statements are clearly made and
viewpoints discussed and shared.  Again, still waiting for a clear
statement.
