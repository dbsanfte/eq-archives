For best performance, turn off all new models, except your own (or even 
your own too, if you aren't interested in owning a horse). Resolution, 
it's up to you. 1024x768 is enough for the game itself, but most of the 
best custom skins require 1200x1024 at least. Texture quality you can 
set to "medium". "low" looks like shit, and won't give you much of an 
speed advantage. "high" looks a little bit too busy for my taste.
