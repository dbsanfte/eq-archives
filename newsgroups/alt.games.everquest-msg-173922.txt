I must say, the graphics do look nice. There are some odd things about
the character models though, like the big hair and the oven-mitt
hands. Also, slung weapons really should have a visible sling or they
look like they are just stuck on the character's back and all the
weapons of similar type look the same - all swords look the same, all
staves look the same, etc.

I would definitely consider giving this one a go though.
