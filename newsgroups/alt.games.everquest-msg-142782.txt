I don't swear.  Ever.  Not for any moral reasons or stuff.  I just don't
swear.

But...

OMG.

OMFG.

I absolutely cannot *believe* they did this.

I'm looking at a five-month wait on my server, possibly more.  And *these*
folks get RF's spawned for them because they *whine*?

What the hell is up with that?

For all the talk about "controlling the rate at which epic enter the world",
some random GM can just dispense with that and give out free epics if they
feel like it.

So what I want to know is... where's my Ragefire?  Should I petition for
one?  Should I, too, act like a complete jerk and force them to give me one?

I simply cannot accept that the GM *rewarded* this kind of behavior by
giving away *the* most sought-after epic in the game.

I hope this is a joke, I really do.

OMG.
