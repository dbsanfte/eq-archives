In fact, none of the major MMORPGs have been released for Christmas.
It goes something like this (some fuzzyness because the graphs I'm looking
at have tick marks six months apart):

    Lineage:    july or august
    Lineage 2:  octoberish
    FF XI:      marchish
    UO:         octoberish
    EQ:         aprilish
    AC:         novemberish
    DAoC:       october
    SWG:        mayish

Releases near Christmas seem to be:

    The Sims Online
    Ragnarok Online
