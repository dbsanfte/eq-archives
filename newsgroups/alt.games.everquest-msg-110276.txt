Hmmm. You could be right. But the new pricing structure could also mean
one of 4 other things.

    1. Everquest is squeezing the last bit of cash out to fund EQ2.

    2. The $40.00 service will survive, since it would provide 75%
        of the profit with 90% less work and equipment.

    3. EQ1 will continue on as usual, with those that joined the legends
        servers ($40.00) getting to transfer their favorite character to EQ2
        in thanks for their loyalty to the game.

    4. EQ1 legends characters to become NPC's in EQ2.

or verant could see the light and realize how much an asset it is to have
happy
customers in BOTH worlds and keep both EQ's up and running for years and
years of bliss for all!

8-)

No matter which of the above (or some strange combination of them all)
Verant
decides, corporations everywhere have been showing their lack of concern for
both their customers and their labor force, so what would make us think that
Verant would be any different? They will make the decision behind closed
doors
with little or no input from anyone but the board of directors. All we can
hope is
that they find their first little "labor of love" profitable enough to
continue. Since
EQ2 is supposed to be the same world, it would seem unlikely, but as Kedrid
has stated, stranger things have happened. They did add classes to the
halfling
and gnome community after all! 8-)
