Today we started with pereparations and creating of a Dutch EQ site, its
ment to be a portal and meetingplace for now (including a forum) but can be
of conveninience of non dutch players as well, we try to have a a dutch and
english spoken versions. Anyone with suggestions, information we can use for
our site can be of help. Allthough I have a commercial company, this is a
non-profit project due to my EQ addiction. I'd love to have screenshots and
information about lvl and server class and so on, of Dutch players or people
who have affinity with that. You will get your photo add in the bar :-)
The URL is on a testsite of us now, it will get its own URL. but can be see
now at http://www.randomdesign.nl/checking/eq/ like i mentioned its far not
ready, but just to give you an idea. We will be working on it every day from
now on, so follow our progress. Other advice, comments and so on, proposals
to participate, or have your photo ad in the bar, you can mail to
paula@randomdesign.nl  Again, anyone who thinks he can participate one way
or another, I'd appreciate everything you have to say or can help with. Also
a guild is possible, I just do not have enough time to do that on my own,
especially not serverwide. This maybe is a beginning. Also, allready
excisting Dutch Guilds are welcome. to represent themselfs
