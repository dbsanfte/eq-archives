This doesn't really affect me, as I cancelled my account a few weeks ago, and
stopped actually playing a few months ago.  But having played a warrior for so
long, this just made me boggle.

So... Paladins and Shadowknights get Defensive, the class defining ability of
a warrior.   Warriors were always a "one trick pony", and now the other two
tank classes will get the ability to perform that trick.   How could this
possibly not move us back to the PoP model?  Where knights were clearly
superior to warriors, since the only real difference was that the knight had
perfect aggro control, while you had to use effort to keep aggro on the
warrior.  (and that the paladin was a backup rezer)  Everything else, such as
survivability, there was zero difference between the three classes.

What grand increase do warriors get to compensate them for losing thier only
advantage?   They're going to slightly increase the usefulness of one of the
three most pathetic warrior abilities ever added, and muck around with the
endurance cost of disciplines a litle.

I don't know.  Maybe I've just been gone from the game too long, and warriors
are currently so overpowered, from warrior only gear or some such thing, that
this is justified, and they will maintain an offsetting advantage that wasn't
present when I was playing.  It's possible.  But from what I saw, I doubt it.

This one made me giggle though.  I think I still understand manaburn better
than them, despite having never played a wizard past level 4.   (Mine is still
logged out with a half used KEI on him.)

Manaburn had three uses.

1) Taking down low hit point (Kunark level, some PoP tier 1) mobs quickly with
no risk.  (Nerfed at PoP release).
2) An increase in DPS, as a wizard could manaburn at the beginning of a big
fight, then mod rod back to "fighting level mana" by the time the tank had
established aggro, and nuke normally, maintaining mana by chewing more rods.
(Nerfed when mod rods were changed from instant use to 5 minute cooldown.)
3) A coup de grace for raids where the tanks and healers have mostly bought
it, and the mob is almost dead.  Giving the wizard a chance to turn it into a
win by spending all remaining mana.   (Will be nerfed by the current change,
since it'll now max out at a small percent of the mobs current HP.)

Now it will have none.   Not that many people thought it's one remaining use
made it worth buying, I don't think, but still.   And to present this as an
improvement....
