You're a monk, right? You have feign death, right? Just introduce the
jerk to a large number of  the local mobs, personally and up close.
I'm sure they wouldn't mind you running up with 5 or 6 mobs a level or
two higher than he is and passing them on by feigning. Just don't let
the GMs catch you. But if you only do it once, it shouldn't be a
problem, since they have to witness the event.
