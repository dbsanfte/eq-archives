Yes, Crisson's Pixie Strike works well to interupt casting, the downside is that
bards can cast it only once every 3 seconds, so if you get a few resists, you'll may
take some damage.  Once it sticks, you'll have greater luck landing the next one because
Pixie strike also reduces their magic resistance.
