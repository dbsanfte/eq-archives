Brad'sNewGame (tm) RUUUL3ZZZ!!!!! DAoC and EQ SUXX0RZZ!~!!!~!
People already started quitting DAoC in droves to sign up for the beta
as soon as he writes some code. They're in serious trouble over there
now. And EQ? Hell, man... Norrath is a barren wasteland.  Probably not
fifty people left playing on any server. That's why they took all the
