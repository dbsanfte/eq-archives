The Eula doesn't need to be on the box. Numerous cases support that.

Personally I'm *disgusted* by what America has allowed into law in the
form of the DMCA. I am equally disgusted by what America has supported
in the EULAs. 

Software developers need to be paid for their effort, nobody disputes
that... that shouldn't however give them a total stranglehold on what
anybody does *after* they pay them for their software.

Its one thing to steal software, its quite another to improve on it,
extend its uses, or find new ways to enjoy it.

As it should be, really. In fact this *should* be law. Software enters
the public domain like all copyrighted work eventually. Software
companies should be required to submit any published title, with all
copy protection , activation, registration removed ideally, along with
source code etc to a central body, to be made available to gen. public
when copyright expires. 

As it stands now a hundred years from now, even if the pcs of the era
could run the software  they won't be able to authenticate their
CD-keys, enforce their EULAs, "perform XP activation" and all the
other copyright BS... effectively rendering them permanently
unusable.

This is unaccpetable.
