I agree.

Ok.

Its not there though, is it?

This is not the one that Australians "ignored", is
it?

Its hardly surprising that DFAT is NOW posting a
warning.

That's odd, Alexander Downer says it had some very
specific stuff about Bali.

Are you sure?

What do you say to this article?

http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/10/14/1034561103025.html

Although there was a general warning (in the DFAT
travel advisory) about Indonesia, there was a
specific reference to Bali which said that tourist
services were "operating normally".

If you read on the DFAT website that tourist
services were operating normally in Bali, would
you say you were ignoring a warning, by going
there?

Or might you think, that DFAT has said it is safe?

I think Downer is going to get into a bit of
trouble over this, especially as it seems the
Americans had upgraded their warning in the
preceding days, whilst Australia did not.
