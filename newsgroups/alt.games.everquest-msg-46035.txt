If I remember right, I did the same with my bard in Sol B. Left or Right 
rooms should be good for you. Kobolds are cute and cuddly compared to 
most things in Kunark.
Another option may be the bears in Great Divide. If I remember 
correctly, they hit for quite pathetic damage for their level, and the 
zone is right there. Few Tizmaks may still be high green to you, and you 
could make some cash if you sold all the weapons from them to the 
merchants that are in about a 20 second run from there for a bard
