I bet far more often than 90% of clerics out there.

A click heal of 220 points works quite well when

working partners with no clarity/manasong on
soloing
putting together someone after a free rez
putting together myself after a rez
partnered with a mage
partnered with a shaman
partnered with a necro

Yes, in a serious situation, its heroic bond and forget
the arms, no question.  And as I level up, more and
more a high level clarity (C2 maybe, C3 certainly)
or bard manasong will let me regen mana from heal
casting faster than wasting my time conserving mana
by standing there clicking.

But I engage in less serious work more often than most, I'll
wager.

I'd use it even more if I didn't also have the Greaves with
their click group heal.
