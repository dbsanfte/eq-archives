    It is. That was how much the existing ZEMs were increased by in one
patch a long, long time ago. This does not tell you what the actual ZEMs
are. For that kind of information, you'd need to poke around the ShowEQ
forums - they'd be the ones to know. So you can understand the numbers you
might find if you can find them, base XP a mob gives = ZEM x (mob_level) x
(mob_level). The base ZEMs from original EQ were 75 for an outdoor zone, 100
for a dungeon.
