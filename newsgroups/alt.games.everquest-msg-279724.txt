It also breaks horribly if your grouped with a guy like Alexyn, 
Albrenect, Amygdal, Azaar, Aarakx ... you get the idea. :)

Personally I right click 95%, and use /assist on my pet or a group mates 
pet 4.99% of the time(who keeps the corpse of his last victim targeted 
until its given a new target) and resort to manually typing /target 
a_goblin the remaining 0.001%

Nobody seems to have mentioned using the mousewheel to swoop in and out 
of 1st and 3rd person in this thread... I use that pretty extensively 
myself; and almost never use any other view.
