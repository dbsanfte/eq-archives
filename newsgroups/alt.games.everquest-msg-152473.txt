My guess is that the problem with the consigment shop approach is keeping
track of who owns what.  I don't think the server keeps ownership
information as part of the data for an item--rather, ownership is determined
by who has possesion of the item.  

They would have to make a new kind of NPC for consignments that keeps track
of where each item came from.  That's probably more work than the approach
they took.
