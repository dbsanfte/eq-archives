Yes actually, I have, including this by you:
"And in fact most self-respecting necro's will not twitch (that's what
they call mana pumping).  They expect other classes to manage their own
mana just like they do.  Granted they are incredibly effecient at it
but still....

I have a 66 necro and I rarely twitch, and only on my own accord.  If a
person asks for it I say no or ignore them.  If they are over their
head then they should tell the group.  If they can't manage their mana,
how the hell did they get to this level in the first place?!"

> No one has said either one,

You wrote that you will not twitch anyone except on rare occaisions
when you are feeling generous.

That's preposterous.  You would be out of my group in a heartbeat,
acting like that.

What is this, semantics over my use of the word "need"?
