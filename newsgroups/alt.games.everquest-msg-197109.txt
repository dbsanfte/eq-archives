I'm right there with you Axster, 62 Shaman here too, and almost quite my
Shaman over this crap. In fact I have been playing a new Shaman alt over on
FV for the last few weeks, sick of logging in to see other guildmates all in
tier 2, but me being in a different time zone, missing all the guild
flagging days and sitting alone having to beg people to help me.

Hopefully its not to late for my Shaman, I hope I can shake all the bad
feelings and start moving ahead again. So sad that, like you say, a 62
Shaman has to be dragged through the trials, As many tells as I've got from
tier 2 to come join a group, when I say I'm not flagged, and hear the "oh,
sorry thanks anyways", that it has come down to not playing my favorite
character.
