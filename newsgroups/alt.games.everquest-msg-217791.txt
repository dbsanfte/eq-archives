It's a nice place to solo for melee skill-ups:  plenty of mobs,
small agro radii, quite a few spots to pull to with no roamers
close enough to agro, vendor in zone, mobs that are pretty
easy to defeat...

I wouldn't go there with an INT caster, but for a melee and/or
a WIS caster who wants melee skill-ups (Defense _is_ helpful)
and is satisfied to work solo it's really a decent zone in
spite of the awful ZEM.
