Any common hardware?  Intel vs Athlon?  Particular video or sound card?
Limited memory?  I have not had this problem.  I'm running XP Pro on a P4,
1.5GHz with 768MB of ram, a not quite latest Sound Blaster card and it's
been a year so I don't remember off the top of my head the video, but it was
top of the line Nvidia GeForce 2 a year ago.

Cheers,
Eric
