Barbarians are a VERY racist bunch on average, I don't think there's much
you can do to fix faction with them other than quests that require you to be
in the good with them already (although, if you kill one and note what
faction goes up, you might be able to kill things on that faction to get
reversed faction hits, note that I say *might*)
