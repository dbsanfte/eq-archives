A "reformat" will wipe out all information on that Drive or Partition.

If you are going from WinME to Win98, then you will have to reformat
the Drive/Partition.

The trick to "reformating" a system is to back-up all of your data (do
NOT backup this data on the drive/partition you are going to reformat)
and have all of your device drivers and application disks on hand
before you start. There is nothing more frustrating than to nuke a
system (ie reformat) only to discover that you forgot to save a file
or do not have a driver disk for you modem (sound card, video card,
etc, etc.)

Is the new PC a clone, or is it built by a company like Dell or
Gateway? Some pre-built PCs contain hardware that only works on the
operating system that ships with the PC (or only has dirvers that work
with that OS) . Downgrading from ME to 98 may not be a problem since
they are very similar, but it is something to consider.
