I would have run for the zone, using straffing to be precise, if I don't
have sow.  You will find that you can outrun most mobs just barely that way.
If your enchanter is level 16 or higher, you should not have to worry about
having sow, just about any sow capable person will gladly trade you a sow
for a breeze or better.  If you don't already know, straffing is done by
holding down the control key, the forward movement key, and either the left
or right turn key.  This will cause you to run at an angle to the direction
you are facing, and you will outrun all normal speed mobs.  Another option
is to toss in a jump once in a while while you are running, this will keep
you one step ahead of normal speed mobs as well, until your stamina runs
out.
