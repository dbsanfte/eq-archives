Oddly enough.  I run a Dual PIII 1 GHZ system with 4x AGP &
768 Ram and Win 2K.  Nice to know someone else thinks along
the same lines.

Anyways, I recently went from a ATI Radeon AIW to a ATI
Radeon 9700 Pro.  The increase in performance was staggering.

That being said, I have a PIII-600 w/ 256 Ram & 2x AGP.  It
had a old RIVA TNT video card in it and I replaced that with
a PNY Nvidia MX 420.  It made a significant boost to quality
too.  And at Medium texture setting the MX 420 performs about
65-75% of the 9700 Pro at High Texture  (which makes sense).

So far the NVidia seems to run (in general) a little smoother with
the drivers.  I haven't had to tweak that computer much.  My ATI
seems to require more attention.  The ATI is on my main computer
though and the second computer basically just runs a mule account
or a friends account if they come to see me.

Personally I'd probably go with the GeForce4 Ti 4200 or
bite the bullet and spring for the ATI 9700 Pro.
Hope that helps some.
