Item haste tends to stack with everything.
I'm a 51 Bard and haste effects have not seemed to stack when I'm swinging
away.  I've read this on EQDiva.com and went to test and it seems legit.
Other components of the songs (like str, etc.) do work, but the haste
doesn't stack.  That site says this as well, and after some testing it seems
correct.
However, a few bard songs (like Ervaj) do stack and can go over the cap.

The one thing I have proven true through testing..."Beer stacks with
everything!"
