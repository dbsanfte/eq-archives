I find that method unlikely, myself.

"Hell levels" are the result of a new multiplier.  The new
multiplier that takes effect at 30, for instance, has to
be applied to the XP in levels 31 through 34 as well.
(It shifts again at 35, obviously.)

So it's not just a question of applying a constant (or even
a shifting) multiplier to XP earned during those levels.  If
they did it that way, they'd drastically shorten the amount
of kills needed to advance from 30 through 50, something
they say they're not doing.

It's far more likely, IMO, that they've just phased in the
multipliers.  Instead of moving from 1.0 to 1.1 at 30, for
instance, they'll most likely move to 1.02 (random number
there) at 25 (something not likely to be noticed) and 1.04
at 26, etc, so that the XP curve appears smooth.   Then all
that has to be done is to translate current XP for everyone
affected to the new XP curve so that they don't log in and
see a shift in their XP bar and/or level.

The "effect" is that everyone in the levels prior to a hell level
will "gain" XP and people in hell levels will "lose" XP, as related
to the overall XP curve.  Since most people will be "winners,"
that's a fairly good solution, especially since the overall XP
change for any one person is going to be relatively small in
comparison for the amount of XP to ding 60.
