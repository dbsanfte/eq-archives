Well of *course* they're going to do this in EQ. All who denied that this 
would ever happen here used the same arguments then, and still it happened. 
Now that they smell the money, they're not going to leave any of it on the 
table for IGE. I'm sure they've been frothing at the mouth for years over 
IGE's ability to monetize something that they've owned and controlled while 
the purists in their organization were holding them back from exploiting 
their own property. The purists lost, the bean counters won. It's a new day 
at SOE.
