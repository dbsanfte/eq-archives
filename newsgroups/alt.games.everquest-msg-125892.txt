I can't answer for anyone else, of course, but I don't "hate" the
bible. I hate many of the things that have been done under the guise
of following it, though.

By the possible "original" intent of the verse, perhaps, but as
research will show there is considerable debate as the what the
original text correctly translates to.

But the Middle Ages are rife with instances of *my* kind of witch, and
even non-witches, being put to death under the 'authority' of this
particular verse, and it's still used by some fundamental Christians
today in condemning us.

And riding right along with those extreme materialistic cases, this
verse condemns every member of a non-Christian religion in the world.
