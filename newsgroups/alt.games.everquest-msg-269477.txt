I tried it again tonight.  It worked.  It's clunky, but it worked.  I was 
UNABLE to join an EQ2 chat channel that had a password though.

Anyway, like I said, clunky.

To join, [join eq2.server.channel-name

To chat, [1 hi!

To list, [list 1

To leave, [leave 1

Maybe it's not so clunky to anyone used to using the left bracket, but 
that's gotta be a minority of us :)
