Same thing on Morell-Thule - we same a few rabid animals, and a farmer
announced the swarm is coming a couple of times in WK, although I didn't see
the swarm mother. We hung around for a while, but nothing happened.

According to people who'd been in the zone the previous night, a female
paladin NPC had been around, saying she was going to curse the land with a
plague as revenge for the death of Mordavin (the unsavoury individuals guy
from a while back). Hence I think this is just one of those mini-sagas that
they put in occasionally.

If you get hold of any unique looking loot, I'd hang on to it for a while -
might be that a GM will turn up looking for proof of the plague or that
you've been fighting against it, same as they did in the unsavoury stuff
(when some people got Fleshbound Tomes and suchlike as rewards).
