I've been playing for awhile, and I have so far played casters almost
exclusively. I recently decided I wanted a change of pace, so I
started an Ogre Warrior. It was WIERD, cause when I first started
there was a Dark Elf in town, and I couldn't figure out what this tiny
little thing was. I kept trying to bash it until I realized it was
another player. Anyway, I've been having some trouble with my ogre.
I'm trying to roleplay him (which I think is real fun, especially with
the dumbing down of the language "Me crush stumpie!"), and there's
nobody there to roleplay with. Oggok is almost always empty. Also, I
can't seem to find any kind of abundance of mobs to fight. I was told
that the whole area around the town is the newbie area, but I have to
wander for like 5 minutes before finding a mob to fight. This means
that I've played for several hours, and am only just now level 2. I'm
usually about level 4 in the same amount of time with my other
characters. The one time that I found a good amount of mobs to fight,
there were too many at once, and I died.

So what can I do as a newbie to try and accelerate my leveling? Or at
least let me know where I need to go so that I can start really
roleplaying and having fun (this character isn't going to try and be
powerful like the other characters have done...he's purely a
roleplaying character, and if he gets powerful in the process, more
power to him). Anyway, thanks in advance for any help that you can
offer.
