No, it's a totally bogus comparison.  I send a single tell asking
for assistance and offerring compensation to a toon I see at rest
in a "massively multiplayer online roleplaying game".  That is not
even vaguely similar to making a blind cold-call to a number off a
list in order to pitch aluminum siding or vacation time-shares.

Perhaps that's why I almost always get a favorable response (as
opposed to the telemarketer's almost never) and sometimes meet a
new in-game friend.
