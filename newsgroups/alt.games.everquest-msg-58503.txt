Yeah but you get used to it and I've already started to fill my ignore list
last time I was in Camelot (started in Hybernia now and am actually enjoying
the game more there)
This is the wrong place to ask this (can't get DAoC ng from work) has anyone
tried the RP servers in DAoC?

CF
From what I have seen of some of the players..one game or other has managed
to lose a few idiots, especially the one that tried his hardest to train and
just got himself killed half a dozen times (shame he wasn't over 5th)
