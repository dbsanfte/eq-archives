If you are referring to the altering of Old World zones such as East
Karana, West Commonlands, and Lake Rathe, those were not GM events.
They were/are scripted. 

If you are referring to the Holloween event that changed Kithicor and
opened Hate, then I have to concede that those events were very cool
and pretty well run. They still remain the exception not the rule.

I never said they have given up. I merely pointed out how most GM
Events go down. Even when things run relatively smoothly only a small
handful of players get to actually do anything or see a reward. How
many people even know about (much less participated in) the "Nexus"
events that lead up to the SoL release? 

If you logged in today and got a message that a GM event was taking
place in Lake Rathe, would you drop what you were doing and rush over
to check it out? I'd bet that most seasoned players would avoid that
zone like the plague based on past experiences.

No the initial post. 

Jumping from "been cheated out of some interesting content" to a
blantant bash at "Legends" and finishing off with "the old servers to
be Abandoned" smells like a troll to me. Unless of course you consider
getting pounded into goo by a GM controlled Uber-Monster and watching
a couple of level maxed characters get the GM reward while you and 300
other people in the zone collect your corpses "interesting content".
