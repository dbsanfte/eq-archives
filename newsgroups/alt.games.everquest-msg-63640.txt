The monk gloves are pretty nice.  The 40 percent spell haste on them means
that it will stack with item haste.   A monk can concievably push himself to
his haste cap without any other classes help.  No other melee class can do
that.   It is also one of the easiest epics out there.

We've actually had this conversation in the not so distant past.

For my own personal opinion, Warriors and Paladins have the worst epics
(possibly Shadow Knights too), both in terms of difficulty and having a poor
reward.

The mage epic sucks mightily as well, but at least there the reward is quite a
bit more substantial.  The epic pet is a real beast.



Since I play a warrior, thats the one I'm most familiar with.   For the
warrior epic, you must get a rare drop from the Golems in Fear, a common drom
from the Maestro (or more specificly  his hand)  in Hate, fight all the way to
the 5'th Island in Sky and kill the Spiroc Lord, kill the Queen in Chardok
(hardest mob there) for an uncommon drop, kill a Red Dragon for an uncommon
drop, (such as Naggy, Ragefire, Talendor or Nortlav the Scalekeeper), and last
but not least, kill an oft ganked Green Dragon, Severillious in Emerald Jungle
for an uncommon drop.  (Oh yes, you can also get the green scale by killing
Hokspur? in Veeshan's Peak....hahahaha)

Each one of those fights requires a raid sized force.  A large raid sized
force.  For all that effort, you get a pair of 14 damage 24 delay swords with
no haste on either one, and no armor class.

For comparison, a Frostbringer is a 1 hand slash that is easily obtainable and
can be purchased.  It is 12 damage, 22 delay.
