    Yeah, isn't this great? ;-) It also lets you determine the relative SIZE
of a faction hit. Example: from feeding gold to Lashun Novashine in Qeynos a
long time ago, my Guards of Qeynos faction is capped. My Corrupt Guards
faction is down at dubious, however. I recently ran into the new NPC in NK
for the Inspector's Badge quest, and HE gives a quest that raises all the
bad Qeynos factions, and only hits Guards, for 5 gold. So I did a little
repair work, then went to the bandit camp near the stone bridge and raised
Guards back up with Upheaval. ;-) Took exactly as many bandit kills to cap
Guards again as I'd done quest iterations, so I can guess that the hit is 1
point (and infer that the raises are also one point).

    I recommend that quest guy for repairing faction, BTW. Actually dealt
with me even though I'm dubious to him.
