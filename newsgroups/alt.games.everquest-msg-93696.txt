Well, yeah, if the only end result you factor in is "Is mob dead?". I was 
looking at efficiency with total downtime considered. Nuking midway through 
a fight (again, assuming no roots) is preferable, as once the mob starts 
running it is effectively dead (assuming you have semicompetent melees). It 
is no longer casting or doing damage to your party, and your casters are 
medding and regaining mana.
