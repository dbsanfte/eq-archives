Oh, good, I'm not the only one. There were several there that I was
able to use, but didn't have either.

Frankly, neither of them is particularly dangerous, especially to a
druid. Just ensure before you port that you're healthy and have a
fresh SoW, and you won't experience any extreme difficulty with either
spot.

In the countless times I've ported to both of those locations, I've
been attacked at each of them just once, and SoW let me quickly
out-distance the attackers.
