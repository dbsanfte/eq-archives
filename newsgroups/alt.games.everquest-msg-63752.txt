Slightly off topic, but kind of relevent :-

I've got a new bard on the AB server which I've got to level 8 and who
remains untwinked so far, but I've still got quite a lot of stuff I wouldn't
want to lose again.

Getting the boat from BB to freeport suddenly it said that I'd been hit
for non-melee damage of 265 points and that I'd fallen to my death and
ended up back in G Faydark.

I petitioned immediatly but set out to look for my corpse. But even with
bard corpse tracking on I couldn't find it. It pointed to somewhere in
the water beyond where the boat zones to freeport as far as I could
tell.

Luckily the senior guide showed up then and after a few questions
gave me a full rez, got my corpse and then ported me to freeport
so I was happy.

Does this kind of thing happen often? In about 2 years of playing
my necro I've not had any sudden deaths like this.
