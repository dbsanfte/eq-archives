Which game programmers have left? Last I heard Brad McQuaid was sort
of kicked out/left of his own volition (depending on who you believe)
and Jeff butler or someone left to work at Brad's new startup. Neither
of them were game programmers though so who are you talking about?
Both were basically producers/CEO's and Brad's main reason for leaving
(he said) was that he no longer had any kind of hands on job but was
just administrating ( in other words his job could be done by several
thousand other monkeys)

Actually Brad leaving was a good thing and if you notice almost all of
the best changes came after he left. He was a bit too stuck in his
"vision" (which is a strangely absent word from anything verant says
lately) though even he admits he still plays sometimes and the game
has improved greatly.

Hmm so you draw a direct correlation between Jeff Butler and Brad
McQuaid leaving causing that? The two are completely unrelated even if
what you are saying is true. Frankly I've never got help in an EQ
"chatroom" in two years so I can't actually make a comparison.

I bet pigs will sprout wings and fly. I'd not hold my breath to wait
on either thing happening. People said the same thing about UO yet two
years later EQ has not really hurt its numbers at all.

Hmm again, what programmer left? Please name a programmer who left
since I have not heard of a single one. One producer left and one CEO
or whatever he was called. You could throw a rock and hit someone who
could do either of their jobs. Now, if Rowyl left (a programmer
responsible for the transparent inventory and other improvements) that
might be a bit of an issue but I don't think he has.

Customer service is no worse than it ever was and is perhaps better.

"Bugged Luclin" is a generalization. Exactly what bugs are you talking
about which have not been fixed or are not being fixed? Did you expect
there to be no bugs when they made so many changes? I certainly enjoy
playing in Luclin and don't really notice it being "bugged."

What does the age of EQ have to do with staying subscribed to it
monthly? I pay for my monthly service and I play for that month. When
I'm tired of EQ I will no longer pay so what "monies" am I investing
into EQ actually? I get what I pay for and its not an investment.

You don't really seem to have much of a valid point at all.
