Could be true for the "classic" Athlons. I zoned into Luclin - the
Nexus was fine, the next zone was fine but when I went into Echo
Caverns EQ would crash every 30-90 seconds. Luckily I never died while
linkdead but I retreated from that zone pretty quickly. I'll adventure
more tomorrow when I get off of work but I'm hoping they fix this
pretty quickly. :(
