Hole creatures hurt faction with MINIONS of underfoot, not the
underfoot himself. And with everything, when a new zone is added they
usually add new faction.  

People used to be scared because they were kos in Kerra ridge they
would be kos in luclin cat city. didn't happen.  Was scared if was kos
to "CombineEmpire" faction in kunark would be kos in luclin, didn't
happen. They reset it globally.

Hell, when kunark came out, they even reset everyones  RingofScale
faction which was unused until kunark.
