I just ran a Guk LDoN yesterday with a pickup group. It was everyone's
first time. Rather interesting place, much different than all the
others. (Visually at least, has great atmosphere.) Though is Guk the
least commonly used place, even less so than Mirriguls. People like to
stick with what is comfortable. It used to be that no one was running
any LDoNs other than Mistmoors, then I started advertising in my LFG
for only specific LDoNs  because I needed points for this or that
spell. I noticed hat in the beginning all the other camps were fairly
empty, but after a while I saw others I had convinced to group with me
in NRo or ECommons leading other groups in those LDoNs. They have a
comfort level with it now.

On the other hand, something you might want to use to convince people
to run Guk LDoNs is that I have been getting 6 points for a
normal/easy LDoN in Mistmoor or Oasis, but I just got 9 points at Guk
with a similarly powered party. (Same relative difficulty as the LDoN
before it, but I got more points simply because it was in Guk I think.
I believe SoE added a little bit extra to make it more attractive. But
it could just be my imagination.)
