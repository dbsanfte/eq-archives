If somebody is dropping real money for stuff, I'm guessing it has no
significance to them outside of the stats bonus.  That is the only
benefit they are getting from the item when spending money on it instead
of questing for it.  Therefore, to them the meaning is still there, even
if it means 'significance' in that case.

Are you equating spending almost your entire life to obtain the pinnacle
of your sport to receiving an item in EQ?

There is a tremendous difference between EQ and the Olympics.  For one
thing, those athletes see that as their career, so they have all the
time in the world to invest in it.  People tend to have jobs outside of
EQ, hence the lack of time to obtain an item.

That would be a workable solution.  Anything to get rid of the farming
monkeys.
