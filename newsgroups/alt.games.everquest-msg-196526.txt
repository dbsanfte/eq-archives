Heh - sorry.  
Here's a couple -
ZEM is the zone experience modifier.  XP for a mob is
given by ((Mob Level * Mob Level) * ZEM * Group_bonus)
The lowest ZEM I know if is 75 - this is standard for 
most outdoor zones like South Karana and the Dreadlands.
It goes way up in dungeons (100 in the Hole, probably
higher in Paludal).  The higher ZEM is a way to encourage
players to go where fighting is harder (risk vs. reward)
like dungeons.

CC is crowd control.  When a group is fighting more than
one monster it becomes important to do something with the
extras.  Things you'll see in relation to this are "Mez"
for mesmerize - a line of spells enchanters get early that
make a monster just stand around picking it's nose.  Very
important - DO NOT HIT A MEZZED MONSTER.  Hitting it breaks
the mez, and it tries to put the smack down on the enchanter.
Root-Park - this is where a character with root pulls the
extra (or add) a ways from the group and roots it in place
so it can't hit folks.  Off-Tank - where one of the party
gets the extra's attention so it doesn't roam around hitting
anyone it chooses.  Finally, pet-tank or pet-mez, where a
pet class (like you) uses their pet to occupy the extra while
the group drops the first mob.

Finally Harmony (and its relatives the lull lines that 
enchanters, bards, paladins and clerics get) - these cause 
monsters to not notice when their buddy is attacked - so
they don't come help.

Remember that mediocre weapons now are the equivalent to topnotch weapons
back then - so you'll be fine.  Getting to places like South Karana
and Lake of Ill Omen is a little harder than PC.  To get to SK you
take the Antonica spire down from the nexus, then just head south over
the bridge.  Lake of Ill Omen is harder, take the Firiona Vie book
down from Plane of Knowledge, then, when you exit the tunnel, head
to the wall (very close), turn right and run along the wall to the stream,
turn left up the stream and follow it until you zone.  Keep a careful
eye out for Drachnids - they will munch you right quick :)

Unfortunately for your warrior, Splitpaw was one of the first zones
to get revamped (many moons ago, pre Kunark I think).  Because it
was so far out of the way, it was "under-utilized".  So, some much
higher level gnolls came along and "evicted" the Splitpaw gnolls.
Splitpaw is a dungeon, the entrance is in South Karana.  If you run
due south from the bridge you'll eventually see these 3 spires 
sticking up, the entrance is in between them.  Around the spires,
where the low level gnolls used to spawn, there are now level 24ish
gnolls.  Perfect for a group of low 20's.  For mid-high 20's/low
30's groups - going inside is a blast.  It will also teach you the
essentials of dungeon fighting, and fighting casters.

For the level 13 - check out Befallen.  Befallen is the first dungeon
I ever visted (at level 7 as a bard - about 2 weeks after release).
It's got 3 levels - In order to get to the bottom you need to defeat
mobs that drop keys.  I  haven't been there in ages, but it must
have gotten the boost that all the low level dungeons got so long
ago.  Befallen is in West Commonlands.  Take the book from Plane
of Knowledge down to West Freeport - run east into West into the
East Commonlands then West into West Commonlands.  THe entrance is 
on the southern wall (the one that's desert). 

Runnyeye Citadel used to be good for low level groups - but it got
revamped a while back - not sure what it's like now.  Take a small
group there to check it out.  Again, it's a low level dungeon, so it
should have comparable xp to Paludal.  It's easy to get to if you 
have Planes of Power, just take the book down from PoK to Rivervale.
This lands you in Misty Thicket, and it's an easy run to Runnyeye
from there, just follow the path to the gate in the wall, then follow
the wall around the zone to the entrance - you'll have to go by some
low level gobby camps to get there, but it's easy at 13 - easier
yet at 21.

You can also check out some old standbys - North Ro, West Commonlands,
the mino caves in Steamfont mountains, Blackburros and Oasis, as well
as the Everfrost plains, with the 13

Highkeep and Unrest used to be favorites at 21 in the old world (before
any expansions).  Upper Guk, Permafrost and Mistmoore Castle might have
been a little higher level - my memory is hazy.

You might also check out the Warrens with the BL.

If you don't have Planes of Power - you should think about getting it.
It doesn't provide any more places to fight, but as a way to get to the 
many places to fight quickly it's invaluable.

I'm glad there are folks out there who are interested in exploring
new places, even though they aren't quite as effective a place to
level as PC - remember, you will probably die while exploring, but
it can very often be well worth it, as you find nice places to go 
that are away from the lemmings.
