I'm still me but I'm not playing EQ2. Yet. I'm fairly tempted, I have
to admit, but having lived through the rollout of EQ1, I'm inclined to
let other people ride the bleeding edge for awhile.

Besides, I'm having trouble bringing myself to drop $40 on a game
these days, not to mention the time I'd spend playing if I got really
addicted again. Between returning to school and running my own
business, time is something I don't have.

Oh yeah, hello everyone.
