At level 71+ and with Demiplane+ level focus.

Well, out of combat regen helps somewhat, but realistically without your 
insta-cast nukes and some major nuke focus, a wizard is largely a mediocre 
dps class.

Nope.
Take a rogue/ranger/zerker/monk at the same gear and level, and the melee 
will out dps the wizard almost always.  And certainly over time, there's no 
contest.

Sony broke the wizard class a long time ago.  They managed to bandaid it bit 
recently with TSS expansion (mostly in the form of insta-cast nukes and the 
out of combat regen), but wizards are still pretty low on the dps scale. 
They might come close in certain cases for very, VERY short burst fights 
(but if the melees have their discs up, it's still no contest) but over time 
your dps sucks much ass I'm afraid.
