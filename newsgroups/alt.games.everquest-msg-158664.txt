If you have the time (lots of it), and the patience (lots of it), and the
money (lots of it) to get some of the tradeskills up to very high levels
(around 250), you can make money selling some high end gear.  There is some
extremely nice smithed armor, but, it is excruciatingly painful and
expensive to get to 250 in smithing.
