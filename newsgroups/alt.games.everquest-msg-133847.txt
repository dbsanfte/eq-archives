ROFL!!!
My high elf cleric has a crystal covered shroud (dress), gatorscale
leggings (skirt), black FP breastplate (blackish plate), withered
leather bracer and nathsar sleeves. I have never had the
veliouswithluclin command turned on, but I had the following happen
one day I looked at her with Luclin graphics:
Wearing the CCS, sitting, replacing CCS with BP: skirt goes straight
down into the ground, leaving cleric kneeling in skin tight leather
pants except for some frilly stuff around her waist and feet.
At one point whilst changing dress and BP back and forth, her sleeves
and bracer morphed into black plate to match the BP. (She looked
pretty good like that, actually)
Sometimes, the color of woven grass armor turns a dark washed out teal
instead of a slightly teal dark green, but I think this happens in
both old and new graphics.
And as for Velious graphics; if I turn them on after having them
turned off, whatever pieces I am wearing have the non velious
graphics, and the graphics remain visible when I take the armor off.
I have to put the armor in my bags, zone and then put it back on to
clear it up.
