There is at least one more. Go to Sol A and kill Lynadia the Exiled (a
lvl 30ish magician). She drops a Lore, No Drop sparkle purse. Give it to
Noressa Sparkle, a merchant in West Commonlands at the hut near Befallen
and get the faction increase. This is a sub-quest for a rogue weapon,
but I presume if you have satisfactory faction with BetaNeutral anyone
can do it. It also gives good exp, about 3/4 of a blue bubble at level
49.

But she only spawns every four hours so it's certainly not the quickest
way to raise BetaNeutral faction.
