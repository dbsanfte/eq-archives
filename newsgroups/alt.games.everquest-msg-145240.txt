Jolt is used all combat long.  I've almost never seen a SK
going hit hit hit FD hit  hit hit FD... and if he did I'd think
he was mad.  SK don't accidentally aggro, with no dual
weild, they hit slow and hard, not fast and annoying.

SK FD is spell FD, and spell FD sucks eggs compared
to monk FD.  Its like comparing bard or druid track
to ranger track.  Sure, better than what all the other
classes (except necros) get, but a pale imitation of
the real thing.\

And I was joking about SK not getting spells, I just have
probably less experience with SK than any other class,
I've grouped and raided with quite a few, but never
had a real buddy SK with whom I could explore the
nuts and bolts of the class to see how it really works.

So to me, SK - tank that can get and hold aggro when
it wants, or generally can avoid  aggro when it wants,
and has a poor man's FD to help single pull in places
where FD isn't critical.
