(see answer below) Does "Rosey Palmer" count?

Does the raise count if you get it 3 months into company lay-offs that
occure in order of how much you're getting paid (bad time for a raise, but
oh well...better than the December 22, "Merry Christmas" lay-off they had.)?
Though I think each lay-off hit on and between every major holiday too.

(related to first answer) Nope...never had a girlfriend. Didn't want to get
involved in that (like you today, hate you tomorrow, like you, hate
you,...fighting, cheating, controlling...not in a world where divorse is
almost as common as marrage, if not more in some places...walk in with
nothing, walk out with at least half of everything...no thanks.)

Or just a Cazik Thule follower?


(Disclaimer: Read the above comments with a sense of humor...unless you were
part of the "Merry Christmas lay-off".)
