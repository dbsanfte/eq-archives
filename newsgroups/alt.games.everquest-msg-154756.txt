You'd still get fine xp in Emerald Jungle at 51, believe it or not. Loot
is pathetic, but you'll generally have it to yourself. Plus there's a
handy zone line to run to if things go south.

While it irks me to say it, you'll still find a fair amount of blues in
parts of DL. 

Not sure how bards solo or how practical it is, but I went from 51 to 54
in Skyfire. Everything is dark blue through those levels, if not white,
yellow, or screaming red.
