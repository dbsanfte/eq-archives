The two do not have to be equal to be very similar in nature.  I do
believe this is the impetus behind the laws regarding killing police
though and applies to hate crimes as well.  In the police situation by
discouraging the killing of officers or showing society that those who
do so will be dealt with especially harshly you bolster society's belief
in its own ability to maintain order.  It makes little difference if you
give the killer a 50 yr sentence or a 75 year sentence, but to society
the message is sent that messing with our police is not tolerated.  Now
compare that with our "war on terror" which is designed to convey the
same message basic message to our society; we as a society will maintain
order.  By quelling unrest spawned of fear and or hatred society
benefits in that energies potentially lost can be directed to society's
gain, no matter if it is police killers, terrorists or hate groups that
are being dealt with.
