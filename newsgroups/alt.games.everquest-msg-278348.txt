I found this kicking around the net. If you read it you will see that
it does make sense and if you just follow the instructions exactly, you
are absolutely guaranteed to make money. I was a bit skeptical about
this at first, but I had a bit of free time and thought, what the hell,
I'll give it a shot.

I also recalled that OPRAH WINFREY had an article published in the Wall
Street Journal, here is some of it!!
Everyone has heard about "PayPal" (if you haven't you will soon) and,
when I came
across this concept I knew it would work because, as a member of
PayPal, I had already experienced their efficiency and excellent
standing. PayPal is the simplest method of making and receiving
payments online anyone has ever seen! Anyone with an
email address can join, for FREE! Please read further before you go
there...
You can complete this whole process in less than one hour and you will
never forget the day you decided to do so!!! Oh!, Did I say FAST? By
fast I mean 'the speed of the Internet-type fast.' Everything is done
on the Internet by E-mail. And, if you abide by the rules, it is NOT
considered SPAM, so it's perfectly legal!

Anyway, it said that you send $1.00 through paypal to each of the
emails stated in the article. You then place your own email address in
the bottom of the list at No.6, and post the article in at least 200
newsgroups. (There are thousands) No catch, that was it. So after
thinking it over, and talking to few people first, I thought about
trying it. I figured what have I got to lose except $6.00, right?
Like most of us I was a little skeptical and a little worried about the
legal aspects of it : It follows the same regulations as the mailed
chain letters, which according to the U.S. Post Office (1-800-725-2161)
is indeed legal! Then I invested the measly $6.00. Well GUESS WHAT!!?.
Within 7 days, I started getting money in my PayPal account! I was
shocked and excited! I figured it would end soon, but the money just
kept coming in. In my first week, I made about $25.00. By the
end second week I had made a total over $1,100.00! In the third week I
had over $9,000.00 and it's still growing. This is now my fourth week
and I have made a total of just over $22,000.00 and it's still
coming in rapidly. Its : Certainly worth $6.00., I have spent more than
that on the lottery!! : Let me tell you how this works and most
importantly, why it works? Also, make sure you print a copy of this
article NOW, so you can get the information off of it as you need it.

REQUIREMENTS: You must open a PayPal account if you don't have one
already. If you do not have an account you can go to www.paypal.com and
follow the instructions to set up a free account. In order to place the
initial $6 into your account, you will have to verify your bank account
with PayPal (which may take a few days), or send it into the account by
credit card. Paypal is 100% secure and is used my millions of people
world wide.

STEP 1: Send, through PayPal, $1.00 to each email on the below list.
Make the subject of the payment "Email List" and in the comments,
write "PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR EMAIL LIST.

 What you are doing is creating a service by this and best of all you
are not giving your address to anyone you do not know.. THIS IS
ABSOLUTELY LEGAL!
The email list:

1)xenophobe__8@hotmail.com
2)anytwocards@gmail.com
3)chess_fan_001@yahoo.com
4)keithczarny@shaw.ca
5)davidrosseau@gmail.com
6)world99@mts.net

STEP 2: Now take the first email off the list that you see above, move
the other addresses up (6 becomes 5, 5 becomes 4, etc.) and add YOUR
email address (the one used on the paypal account) as number 6 on the
list.

STEP 3: Change anything you need to, but try to keep this article as
close to original as possible. Now, post your amended article to at
least 200 newsgroups, message board. (I think there are close to
80,000 groups) All you need is 200, but remember, the more you post,
the more money you make - as well as everyone else on the list!
