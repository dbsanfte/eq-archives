Ah, it's so cool to hear from a true newbie who GETS the game.  There are
way too many that start playing and hear someone start begging, so they
think it's ok.

But yeah, print some damned maps. :)  My first real character was also a
dwarf and I didn't need no stinking maps either....  Hell, at that time I
didn't even really know what zoning WAS.

Glad you had fun. :)
