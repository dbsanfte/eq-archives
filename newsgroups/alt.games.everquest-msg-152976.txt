Heh, the buzof program suggesion would seem to back that point. :)

}"Since now ALT+TAB gives the "crash to desktop" effect (EQ COMPLETELY closes
}since you can't get back in anyway), has anyone experimented with using this
}as a way to program EQ to close at a certain time?

Thing is, it doesn't give that effect on all computers and/or OSes.  I know 
on my most-used computer, when it has an effect at all, alt-tab minimizes EQ, 
and there's still goofy stuff on the task list running.  Usually the system 
crashes a bit after that and I have to reboot.  With EQW, though, I can 
ctrl-alt-del and kill the one EQW task on the list, and it seems to shut EQ 
down completely.  I've seen that work much more consistently on a variety of 
systems.  There might be some other way to automate the use of the task list.

}THAT is why I am guessing that they (and many others) failed to read the
}post, as well as the last few words (& abreviations) of the subject (the
}"while AFK", as in "away from keyboard").

Sounds like a bad guess to me. *shrug*.

}> For instance, here's something that comes to mind for WinXP (yes, I saw
}> that you have 98SE...I don't know if 98SE has anything similar to this).

}No, I don't think I've ever seen such a thing in 98SE.  It might be an added
}feature in ME, 2000, or XP.  That is why I'd thought of the idea of
}experimenting with getting something else to "crash" EQ out (since it
}doesn't really crash, just self-close).

Hmm.  I know we have a task scheduler in 98, can't speak about SE.  I had to 
figure out how to permanently nuke it so it wouldn't get any tricky ideas 
about trying to defrag my harddrive or something while I was on a raid.
