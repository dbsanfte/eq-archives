Glad to see a chanter agree on KEI, its done a ton to make a caster
more playable a bit too much. Now as for Melees....

As for a fungi being the melee version of kei I have to disagree
completely. A list of reasons I take that position; 

First reason is availibility to the average player, the fungi just
isnt. Please dont claim it is theres a limited number in the game cant
say the same for KEI.

Second the other stats of a fungi suck eggs while KEI adds a healthly
boost to Int/Wis in addition to regen (of manna as opposed to
hitpoints). Not many 25 INT items in the game for 20p. Even at 50p a
pop for KEI thats 1000 KEI fixes for the price of a fungi. Hardly an
issue.

Third a twinked caster with KEI can flat out smoke a twinked melee
with a fungi. True its situational for sure  but the ones favoring
casters will far out number the ones that dont. I know this having
done both, fungi on a twink monk (Pre nerf but lets not open that
wound) and KEI on both a necro ( yes works great on necros too, good
to stay at full health) and a druid. Casters win hands down. Reason?
They dont get hit and they can turn out DPS faster than the melee.
Heck I can even see situations where a naked caster with KEI will out
do the twinked melee, PoP anyone? Remember how important it is not to
get hit...

Lastly a "Melee KEI" would have to do several things, Large boost to
AC or Hitpoints, Large boost to Health regen (greater than fungi), and
a large boost to DPS. After all isnt that what KEI does for casters in
a sense? Increace regen of critical stat, increase pool of that stat,
alow increasd DPS due to first two.
