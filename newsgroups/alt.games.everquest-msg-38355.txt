Not exactly what I am talking about. If I say a druid gets SoW at 16 and you
say 'No, they get it at 14' a lack of a response by me is an acceptance of
your position.

If I respond ~'You don't know what your are talking about' it is at your
option to either count on the user base to know you were right or respond
with a dismissive statement as your free time allows.

Free time is an important factor. For instance, in the recent safe travel
times in Kith and undead spawn, the thread drifted into spawn/night time for
the zone. IIRC, the last two standing were both wrong, but I didn't consider
it worth my time correcting them. You have to balance cost vs importance. If
two people are arguing a trivial and pointless fact, lack of responses to
the thread have more to do with no one else gives a shit vs acceptance of
either side.

That is why I used the "Could Mickey Mouse beat Superman?" example.
Completely pointless to have a position and absence from participation in
the thread implies as much.
