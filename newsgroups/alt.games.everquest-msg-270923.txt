I would say don't buy the top of the line newcommer armor at all, buy 
the bottom of the barrel stuff.  Unless you are going to stay nuetral, 
the cheap stuff upgrades just like the expensive once badged, and you 
can use it earlier and save some substantial cash.

I could be wrong, I only tested this once, but I'm pretty sure that 
level 1 newcommer, converted to clan, and upgraded to level 9, is the 
same as level 9 newcommer converted to clan.

Doh, I missed out on that one, the special attacks are a nice bonus and 
I've been using Fling Shot a lot.  Burst would be sweet on top of that, 
particularly on a weapon that doesn't use up ammo.

Oh well, next time... I keep trying new professions out, I'm sure there 
will be a next time.

I'd advise raising attributes, though, everything on that first page, 
all the way, for your first 10 or 15 levels raise them all.  They affect 
the limits on your other skills in some cases, and your HP and nano pool.

I also think you want to raise the weapon skills you are using, and your 
init skills for ranged or melee, whichever you are using; these affect 
you in a fight as well.

Although you get warnings that you can only raise a skill by 4 points 
per level, what that really means is that your cap goes up that much, 
you can neglect a skill for 8 levels, then go in and raise it just as 
high as if you'd raised it 4 points every level.

Also very important is the fact that you can get gear and implants and 
even buffs that will raise your skill levels (or in some cases, lower 
them); you can use this effect to use skills or put on gear that you 
aren't normally qualified for.  Apparantly if you overdo this, putting 
on much much better gear than you should, and then lose the bonus, you 
can be penalized for this.

I have a piece of gear, though, on one character, that lowered my Sense 
stat by one point.  I was able to raise my skill to 29 with it on, but 
needed 30 to put a different piece of gear on.  Took off the lowering 
item (range finder), put on the gear, then put the range finder back on, 
and no harm done.  If I'd wanted to take the gear off and put it back 
on, I'd have had to remove the rangefinder again temporarily.... but 
soon enough I leveled and so could raise my Sense skill and stop 
worrying about it.

I see little reason to stay past 6 or so, the game is actually better 
out in the real world, but the big caveat is to be sure and get all the 
good gear Palindrome mentions here first, as you can't come back, and 
you won't be able to afford better in the real world for a long time, 
even though you'll be making better money out there than on the island.

Don't try and leave the island with a lot of cash, your definition of "a 
lot" will change drastically once you can go on missions.

Full set of newcommer armor, converted to clan or omni, plus two 
upgraded weapons, plus your nano kit... theres some more gravy to be had 
but it takes more work or luck to get.  Leveling to 8 or 9 takes a lot 
of patience unless you have a way to hunt without actually lifting a 
finger (pet class) as the Scouts yeild terrible exp but are very hard to 
kill, and everything else other than the boss mobs starts to turn grey 
on you.
