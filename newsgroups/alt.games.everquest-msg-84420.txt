Strange, I always thought if you camped, you corpse went away FASTER....
than if you stayed on the server (even at char select screen).
I had a level 5 rogue last all night once after he died... I just sat my
char down and hid.  When I woke up, I went in on the CR and there I was. -
However, the same char (almost immediately after) died again. This time I
camped for the day and went back after work (8-9 hours later) and there was
nothing... no corpse.  Interesting..
