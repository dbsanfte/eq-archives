It's time for a new set of characters for my husband and I, and while we
have our cleric/sk team, he's wavering between wanting to be an SK and
doing a bard.  

I am 75% sure that I want to compliment his bard with a magician...it just
seems like that would be a fun pair, and I'm long overdue to have fun with
pets, big nukes, and pretty dresses....but I would like to hear some other
opinions from bards about what classes they find compliment them the most.
