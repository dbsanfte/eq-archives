Doesn't matter, Cel.

If the person was enough of 46 to get there and die (even Fear, that
you just walk in to) to leave a body, you can be rez'd back.

Even if you're now level 45.

Rez spells bypass the normal "check to see if he's 46 before I'll let
him zone" rules about the planes.

Now if they would just let my level 3 halfling rogue in the Hole zone
into Underfoot...
