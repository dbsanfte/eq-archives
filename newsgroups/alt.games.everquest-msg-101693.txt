Yeeeaahhhh, that's true.  Trouble is, the joke god old...oh...3 years ago?
Now it's just stupid.

If friends ask for "crack" I ask them to either ask for C (well, C2 now) or
spell it out, and not to call it that really stupid name.  I do the same for
friends who type "plz."  I'm occasionally a smartass/jerk to strangers, but
I'm diplomatic with friends.

I don't get pissed off about it.  It's been a posted Gnome Annoyance on my
guild's board, but it's only an annoyance.  I am seriously anti-(illegal)
drug and this gets under my skin every time I hear it but after the 576th
person who thinks it's "cute" to make a illegal drug reference I'm mostly
just numb to it.
