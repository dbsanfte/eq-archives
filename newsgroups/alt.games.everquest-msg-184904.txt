Weird... Im having similar issues with one machine/account...  all
drivers up to date, and DX9 installed... would stay online for DAYS
and DAYS with no drop.  (this machine is only used for Bazaar) but
after LOY patch it drops quite often... and LoY is not enabled on this
account.
this machine is running win 98.

another machine/account on Win2k stays up with no issue whatsoever....

sure wish faned would give more of a clue on what hes doing to prevent
the crash... losing lots of plat  8 (

good hunting all
