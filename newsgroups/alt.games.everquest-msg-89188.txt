1. Words of... are spell research components

2. Expense is not the key (thou8gh it is related).  Right-click the 
food/drink you want to buy.  For food, go for banquets for long lasting 
meals.  Not sure what it is for drinks.

3. Those "others" may be twinked.  Check out http://eq.castersrealm.com/ and 
class-related boards for hunting ideas.

4. Never played an evil so I don't know.
