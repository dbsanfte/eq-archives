I feel like such a bum.. only had 27 bucks to spare for luclin.
Decided "hmmm I better look around on the floor for change.."  found
75 bucks worth of quarters (and thats just the quarters.. guess the
rest might total fairly high too), took to bank this morning and
exchanged for dollars. Went to software etc 12 minutes after they
opened, 4 big boxes O' luclin there, bought one no prob with no
reserving even. Went to outlet near me and bought 256 meg sdram dimm
133 mhz  for 30 bucks.

Got home, plopped in dimm, 384 ram  now, installed Luclin. I was ready
to go 2 hours after the time Luclin was supposed to go live .. with
all of that. 

Still not up though, had interview for job at 2 pm, went, home now
still not up.

Ran testeverquest.exe to fully patch up luclin before the regular one
allows you to do so ;) (select regular server in it) Configured the
graphics via the screens (can do that from testeverquest.exe too) at
384 meg of ram it had all but like 4 models as new by default, I went
ahead and selected all as new though it suggested 20. A popup thing
comes up then "are you sure?" but it allows you to select whatever. I
figure the fact that I always play with server filter on and
spelleffects filter on and particle effects low or off will make up
for it.

You can also select lower quality textures. I'd rather have all the
new models and some stuff turned down than the other way.

Oh, and vah shir is grayed out, so it is indeed the same quality model
with luclin or without ( since no way to select a higher qual one)

All in all I had a pretty good day...
