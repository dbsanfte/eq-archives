There are "Wayfarer camps" scattered about where you can gather to
form a group, then get an adventure (or a raid) assigned. In the
assignment, it will tell you what zone the entrance to the dungeon
you're being sent to is. ( Rujakin (or however it's spelled) hills
area is a trap door right smack in the middle of the Orc Highway, for
example)

No one else can go in because they have the ability to run multiple
instances of each dungeon. Basically, the instance only exists for the
group that has the mission assigned to them.
