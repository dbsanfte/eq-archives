Had a monk a couple of months ago just *not* move out of a room with a 
trap, and kept cycling back in. No mobs, a dead end. But then again, He 
couldn't seem do much in the way of DPS=\ and was pretty much a dud 
compared to a fair number of monks I have grouped with. I think he got 
hit by that same poison trap 8 or 9 times. Thankfully it was on a 
mass-kill and we were in the last 20 minutes. Talk about a mana-sponge.
