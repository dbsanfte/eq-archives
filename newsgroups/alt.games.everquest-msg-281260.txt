Yea, and let me tell you that 3 Festering Hags at once isn't exactly a
cake walk when you're in your late teens, but it's doable.  Our tank
is pretty damn good, and the entire party is DPS, so we can dish out
alot.  The tank held aggro pretty much the entire time, the pocket
cleric kept him healed, and it still took us about 6 minutes of
constant melee to take out that pull.  Our puller knows no fear, one
might say he's an idiot.  But it's never boring, and that is the point
after all....
