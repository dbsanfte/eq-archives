Actually, this does not work. The fundamental assumption behind progressive
betting is that -- eventually -- you are going to win one. But random events
have no memory and a losing streak can continue indefinitely. Note, also,
that the casino will never run out of money (since they are getting all the
money you've lost to date, they are never putting more than $100 of "their"
money at risk).

Or, to look at it mathematically. Suppose we have a house where the margin
is 1% (i.e. the house has a 51% chance of winning a bet and you have a 49%
chance). The odds of getting N consecutive losses is (.51)^N and your total
investment for N games -- assuming you started at $1 -- is 2^N-1. Your
expected profit is:
    + (1 - (0.51^N)) * 1   {you win one of the N games}
    - 0.51^N * (2^N-1)    {you lost all N games}

Let's suppose you have $68 billion to spend. That gives you enough money for
35 rounds. The chance of getting 35 consecutive losses is 1/34 billion.
Pretty good odds ... except that you had to spend $68 billion to get it. If
you walk into the casino with $68  billion in your pocket and do progressive
betting starting with a $1 bet.
   99.999999997% of the time you win $1.
     0.000000003% of the time you lose $68 billion.

Expected profit is: 99.9...97% * $1 - 0.0...03% * $68 billion = -$1.03.

In other words, on average, you lose money. The only way to reduce your
losses is to walk into the casino with less money. If you walk in with only
$1,023 (enough for 10 rounds) you only lose, on average, only $0.21.
