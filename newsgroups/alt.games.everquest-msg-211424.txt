The only one that can be put on the same line is the delay, it is put 
before the command, but occurs after the command on the same line.  The 
big issue you can run into on one like that is a single fizzle will mess 
you up, particularly on a bot where you are likely not paying much 
attention.  For my heal hotkey, not for a bot, I have three casts of the 
spell, along with one message, and a stand.  I think you seperate the 
commands by a comma, been quite a while since I've set up a hotkey 
really.
