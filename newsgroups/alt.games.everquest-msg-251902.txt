Ah, that would explain it then. My strength is pretty up there. Until I did
some upgrading yesterday, my strength was 226 while I was fighting with the
hammer. (After upgrade, it's now 234.) Thanks, that definitely clears up

However, I don't see those damage bonuses when I look at a weapon. Kinda
sucks, would be nice to know exactly what my damage bonus is. :)
