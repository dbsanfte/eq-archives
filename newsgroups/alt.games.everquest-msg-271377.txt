Not quite.

1) Fairplay isn't leveraging a virtual monopoly.
2) Fairplay, as near as I can tell, wasn't developed in response to a 
desire to give Apple 'control' over music formats. It was developed to 
assuage the recording industry. To get their endorsement of the ipod, 
and the itunes store.

I'd look really hard at the recording industry long before I even 
thought about blaming Apple. If apple could have just gone with MP3 they 
likely would have.

or just stream it through a digital-analog-digital conversion. Sure you 
lose some fidelity, but not much if your equipment is good, and it 
doesn't even violate the DMCA.
