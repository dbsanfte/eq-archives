This newsgroup isn't "alt.world.hunger"

Its about EQ.

So any arguements designed around the idea that all discussion of EQ is futile and
silly, as the pursuit itself is futile and silly are specious.

While EQ compared to other issues is indeed a silly and frivolous "network time
waster" (my absolute favorite TV moment), in this forum, its assumed that your
audience is indeed willing to suspend recognition of that fact.

To understand this further, take a look at William Shatner's famous SNL speech in
which he goes nearly postal insisting that Trek fans "Get a life!"

Or watch Galaxy Quest (a movie which must have been inspired by that speech) and see
Tim Allen's character telling a fan that he can't explain some engineering point
because "there is no engine, there is no goddamn ship!

Star Trek fans discuss dilithium crystals and romulan/klingon politics within a "if
this were all real" environment.  You could end any debate within that frame by
pointing out that there "is no goddamn ship" but what that does is break the "if this
were all real" compact under which such deliberations are born.

You could look at any discussion in this newsgroup and trump it by saying "it doesn't
matter because EQ is a silly trivial pursuit, do what you want"

And you would be correct.

You'd also be out of order.

A discussion of how EQ is a silly trifle is in order as part of the newsgroup, but
its not in order as part of discussions about EQ itself.

A tarnished Short Sword is better than a Rusty Short Sword... unless you recall that
""it doesn't matter because EQ is a silly trivial pursuit, do what you want"

You can take on the AOW armed with that rusty short sword and defend your actions by
saying ""it doesn't matter because EQ is a silly trivial pursuit, do what you want"
but what you are doing is wasting the time of dozens of your friends and hundreds
more people you don't know who were all willing to abide by the social compact in
which we pretend EQ matters.
