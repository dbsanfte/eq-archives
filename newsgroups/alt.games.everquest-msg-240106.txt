I'm afraid it is not, M. Hunt. It doesn't matter if the person is
sending a photograph, recipe, or whatever. If it smells like a pyramid
scheme, it is a pyramid scheme. 

This scheme is illegal in the United States as well as Canada. It is
an illegal "postal lottery" pyramid scheme.

The only appropriate websites will tell you that all of these are
illegal. 

Nice of you to provide the variation where its only your name and
address, with you getting 5 bucks. did you think that one up by
yourself? What idiots never seem to understand is this:

WHY would the person who also trys the scheme, actually send you 5
bucks? THEY WON'T. There is no reason for them to send you 5 bucks.
They can put their own letter up with their address, without sending
you a dime. So guess what? THAT IS WHAT THEY WILL DO. No one has ever
made money off of these. All you do is give out your address so that
we can forward it to the proper postal authorities in your area,
notifying them of you trying to perpetuate and illegal postal lottery.
