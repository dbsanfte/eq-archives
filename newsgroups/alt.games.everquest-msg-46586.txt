Trust us, you *are* visible when looting.  (Picking up ground items doesn't,
however).

The work around is this:

* target your corpse
* hit your Hide key to un-hide
* right-click your corpse
* QUICKLY, re-hide.

You will be visible for a second or so, but your hide will start before the
looting starts, and finish by the time the loot screen comes up.
The SAME method also works on merchants when something may be KoS to you
(like when I shop in Kael).
