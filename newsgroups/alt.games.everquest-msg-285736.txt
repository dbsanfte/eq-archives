I'm not even talking about developing the engine, itself. If I'm not 
mistaken, Vanguard uses a modified version of the Unreal engine. Beyond 
that, there is a lot more to it than just dropping in the engine and using 
it to move objects around. Heck, *I* could probably create a character 
model and simply animate it with the Unreal engine. The difficulty is in 
managing the processing and network communications required in a game where 
hundreds of "remote controlled" character models are in play in a given 
area at any given time, not to mention all the server-manipulated MOB's.

Add to that the fact that single-player games will typically have a more 
restrictive gameplay area. MMORPG's tend to be more open and explorable. As 
such, there are more scenarios for which to account in the areas of 
collision detection, location accessibility, etc.
