I can't remember it being announced in a patch but IIRC there was a post here
about it a while back and yes, it definately makes it easier to keep track of

FYI one improvement that was announcd is that you now have to have the
appropriate instrument equiped to get a skill up.

Dandaro lvl 28 + working on it.
