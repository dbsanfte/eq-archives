*perk*

Well, I HAVE been pondering creating a male dark elf (they're just too 
hot for words - I could set the view so I could watch my butt every time 
I ran.  Wait, is that TMI?) and I AM out of character slots on TM... :D

See, I knew all that.  The fish prices and the bread exp thing I mean.  
The smithing I've never bothered with so I wouldn't know or care. :) I 
was just trying to get him to explain to me how 'nerfing' bread results 
in not being able to make fish fillets to create armor with anymore *g*

Phew. I was afraid it was me.
