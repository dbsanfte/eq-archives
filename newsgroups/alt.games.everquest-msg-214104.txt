You're an idiot.

Let's see you pull for a group with that snare.  Oops, summoned and the mob
still isn't in camp.  You suck.

You need to get all those mezzed mobs snared so that the enchanter has a
chance to live when the mezzes start breaking.  We've only got a monk tank
with no taunt.  What's that?  YOU'RE BREAKING THE MEZZES AHEAD OF TIME?
You suck.

Snare that mob before it runs around the cor...  YOU SUCK!

Seriously, you're an idiot.  I'm not so sure I'd classify that as an insult
so much as a derogatory observation.  :)

"You need to get all those mezzed mobs snared so that the enchanter has a
chance to live when the mezzes start breaking."

You obviously don't group or have any clue about what happens in groups.

Crap scenarios that never happen?  "You need to get all those mezzed mobs
snared..." describes the majority of the "old schooler" grinding experience. 
Long live Sebilis.
