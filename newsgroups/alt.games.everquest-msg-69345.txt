so the answer is, enhance.  Naked hands ratio 2.22,  6/27 weapons ratio 2.22,
but weapon is faster, which means any damage bonus you may have (strength, say)
will be done more often, and you will get more skill checks.  Since you probably
have a real weapon to use when you actually need to do damage, and use HTH
just to keep the skill trained up for when it becomes useful, this weapon will
reduce the time you need to spend on HTH skill, so you can use your real weapons
more, and therefore you will do more damage each level.  Heck, a 1/27 weapon
would be better than a 8/36 one!

At this point the damage ratio on your fists is higher... but as I said above,
you'll
probably still be better off with the faster weapon for training purposes and a
real weapon if you need to do damage.

Llyran
12 beastlord, Morel Thule

feeling a lot happier about his quest weapons, an apparantly uber 7/28 HTH pair
of claws, so far... a 2.5 ratio or roughly the equivalent of 34 monk fists and
faster.
