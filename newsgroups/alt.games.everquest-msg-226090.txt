    No. Other people know about spell research, and now the components for
the rare spells actually sell for MORE than the completed spells in some
cases. Welcome to Bazaar Logic 101. There are still opportunities for
profit, though, if you're making rare spells for common classes.

    That is correct. As a magician, you can research mage spells, and any of
the advanced priest spells.

> Now what I don't see is where these advanced components drop

    Off mobs that are levels 51 and higher, in general. The level range of
the mob should be about the same as the level of the spell that can be
researched with the components that mob drops. That is a little off in
places, especially when a component can be used to research spells that
differ wildly in level, but it's a good rule of thumb.

> I've
> -heard- that LOY is the only place to find them

    No. All over the place. Cazic Thule drops a fair number, and I've found
LDoN to be an excellent source for them (in level 65 adventures - dunno at
what level break point the advanced ones start dropping). I find if you get
online an hour or so after a patch and start porting between adventure camps
you can make one hell of a profit just buying out vendors of those and the
LDoN smithing temper stuff.

> and look for deals in the bazaar.

    You won't find many Bazaar deals. Every so often someone will put a Word
or Rune up at the same price as other cheap ones (5-10 pp), but it usually
stands out against the others selling for multiple K each and gets bought
fast.

    I'd say it's worth it long-term. Once you hit 65 and start doing those
LDoN adventures, you'll find a ton of research components and pretty much
nobody else in the party will want them or even know if they're valuable. In
my guild, maybe 5 to 10% of the people could identify a rare drop research
item, and a further 50% or more know that Yaeth's 73 Right is valuable.
You'll also be able to vendor dive effectively, knowing what should stay on
a vendor and what should be bought. And if you ever get powerful enough to
do level 65 Hard adventures, cha-ching. That's where the rares for level
59-60 spells drop, and the cash is good. My caster alts (MAG, NEC, ENC, SHM)
all have a near-full set of 51-60 spells in the bank waiting for them as
they level, and as recently as last week I did an adventure and sold two of
the words that dropped for 9 K each.

    For any spell that's worth researching for sale, yes, get at the cap.
The only way you'll hit 200 is with LDoN combines or spending training
points, though. Being a magician stinks for low-level research. =/

> Is there a geerlok for research

    Yes. Geerlok Automated Quill, IIRC. Search on "quill" in the Bazaar and
you should find it. Made with stuff that drops in LoY, and fairly common
stuff at that (I've seen the silver quill needed on more than a few PoK
vendors). +5%, same as the other Geerloks. There's some question as to
whether it also helps people with a 200 skill, which is the skill cap but
which may not be the success cap.
