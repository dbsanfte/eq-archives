Well yeah, I was just simplifying my explanation.  I have a littleWiz I've
never been able to get past level 7. After playing her for a half hour or so
and getting killed 3 times or more I give up and come back a month later.
Those Wizards are so darn fragile!  I haven't deleted her cuz she's kinda
cute.  It's always impressive watching a little gnome standing clamly in
front of a Giant as it's health just goes down, down down.  So maybe in 4 or
5 years she'll be able to do that.
