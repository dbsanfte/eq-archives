I've heard that theory too, but haven't seen any thing to really back it 
up. The first 20 levels go by so fast it probably doesn't really matter 
if it won't work until his 22nd... but I'd be interested to know either way.

These days prices are wonky. But even 1kpp is a lot for something this 
easy to get. As for the % alla says 15 but I don't know. It may be 
relevant if the haste is level affected, particularly as the character 
in question is 15th level.
