There's all sorts of shit in the database. They probably have no way of
removing stuff, or even if they do, it's probably easier to simply add
new items to the end, than clear out the junk and delete the wrong thing
by mistake. Imagine if instead of removing that ring, they got the
numbers transposed and nuked every 'A Handmade Backpack' in existance?

 This isn't a spoof item, it's simply a test/GM item that will never see
the light of day (and was never meant to).
