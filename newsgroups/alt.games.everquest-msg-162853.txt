Hmm.... You know you can blur/atone a mob while it is still mezzed, right?  
And sometimes mezz itself will manage to blur.  You just may not be able to 
tell if it worked until the mob wakes up.  Oh, and you don't have to hit the 
mob to break mez, just wait out the duration of mez (about a minute, 
depending on which exact spell).
