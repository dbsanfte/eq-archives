In my limited experience, necromancers are not preferred into groups because
most necromancers are soloists.  They like doing it alone (thus why they
picked the class) and have developed their play style along those lines.
Sure once in a while they get lonely and want to group.  But then what do
they bring to the group?  You list spells.  Those don't matter.  What
matters is if you know HOW to use those spells IN a group?  Most necros I've
had in groups don't.

They also get frustrated because the group doesn't operate in the same way
they do solo.  We have slow times that necros are not used to.  We take
breaks.  We talk a lot.  Not just socially but what we're going to do next
and how we're going to do it.  More than one necro has left a group I was in
because we're "too damn slow".  Nevermind that when we roll, we become an
assembly-line slaughter house.

Lastly, necros tend to cop an attitude.  It is common when we discuss who to
invite into a group that the Number One reason to not invite a necro is
because s/he "has an attitude problem".  Why this is might be because,
again, necros are soloists thus have come to depend on and trust their own
judgement when taking on a mob.  It might not, but that's the best reason I
can come up with.  Well that and it might be a defensive mechanism since no
one really listens to them.  The main reason no one listens to them is
because everyone has heard necros give the wrong suggestions for taking on a
mob before too many times.  The suggestions would probably be right IF you
were soloing, but not for a group.

The best necromancers I've had in groups only hunt in groups.  They
understand they're like druids.  Support role group members.  Not a star.
They fill in where needed.  They don't heal but dump mana into the cleric.
They only mezz when the chanter is being attacked and then only mezz the mob
that's attacking the chanter off the chanter.  They nuke, but cannot out do
the wizards for the knock-out nuke.  And necro pets used to be welcomed in
groups.  As I rise higher and higher, necros are told more and more not to
have a pet as they cause more problems then they help with.

But, again, this is just my limited experience with necros.
