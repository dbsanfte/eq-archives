According to /played, I have around 46 days invested in my main.  Let's round it to 1100
hours.  I probably have another 200 hours or so invested in various alts.  So let's call
it 1300 hours of game time, since late October 2001.

I can't begin to measure the time I've spent in AGE, on guild/class/SoE/resource websites,
and talking about EQ in RL.

Best regards,
