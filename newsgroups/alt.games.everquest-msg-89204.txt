Hail,

I have a level 27 Beastlord that has just maxed out the Paludal Caverns
usefullness (XPwise) and after a brief bit of searching decided Marus Seru
may be a decent stomping grounds for a while. Has anybody spent any time in
this zone and encountered any difficulties such as pet pathing traps, hidden
mobs, social mobs with uber aggro radius's or other habitual "loading please
wait" scenarios?

My Beastlord is Tribunal following Barbarian that is untwinked but has
managed to get a few decent buys, ie: two Polished Steel Ulaks and a Heroes
Bracer and a 35hp/25hp ring but the rest is a dodgy mish mash of Splitpaw
Hide and whatever else I have managed to pry of the still warm backs of
Patog Phlargs (fungal feinds) still warm backs. AC is 512 and HP is 750. I
generally solo exclusively and have all expansions so if anyone has found
other good zones for pet soloing in the late 20's, early 30's could they
please let me know also : )


Many thanks in advance.
