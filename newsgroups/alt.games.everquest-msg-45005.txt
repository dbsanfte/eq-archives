Well, there was a problem with some garbled
symbols appearing in the chat window at odd times,
replacing some text, most likely, but noone has
been able to pin down -which- text.  Likely
culprits are bind wounds and archery messages.

I also saw a lot of instances where I healed
my groupmates mid fight, using either Word
of Healing (leg click) or Remedy or CHeal,
and yet didn't get a faction hit.  Filed a report
showing a CHeal and exp message, then petitioned
and bugged the thing.  The guide that contacted
me says that that is usual, but he's wrong, it
happens rarely at best, I've been clericing for
91 levels now, and often have either -wanted-
faction hits (KD, which is where I was this time) or
wanted to avoid them (Icewell, for example) and
know by and large what to do or avoid doing to
get em.  Yes, occaisionally you miss one, but not
half the time!
