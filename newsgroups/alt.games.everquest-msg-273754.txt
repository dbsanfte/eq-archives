I'm very amenable to a genuine apology and my ability to forgive and forget 
is there (remember, I'm the flexible guy :)  But I don't ignore the greater 
context, it all goes into the mix and the overall picture here was what 
determined the decision.

No, reasonable people recognize that slavish adherence to policy is not 
always the best solution to a problem. Life just isn't that simple, and the 
ability to recognize when it's appropriate to challenge the process is one 
of the things that makes a good leader. You can argue that this wasn't an 
appropriate exception to make, and I would entertain that argument, but I 
wouldn't want to be part of any company or guild that couldn't retain the 
flexibility to make the right choice in a given situation simply because it 
was "against policy".
