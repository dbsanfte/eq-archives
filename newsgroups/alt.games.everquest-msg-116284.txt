First, vague != deceitful, especially in that context.  He said he
was broke and couldn't offer much.  If the porter expected the
"standard" price, he shouldn't answer a request that specifies
he won't get it.

As far as the "reasonable" amount goes, how much is that once
you're established you're not going to pay the "standard" rate?
One could argue that 3pp (about 1/3rd the going rate for old
world ports on Zeb) isn't insulting at all while 3gp would be.

Nonsense.  The *very* standard "donating for port" or "donating
for rez" is vague.  Sure the player base has established typical
prices, depending on location, level, etc, but other than the few
(in comparison) "donating 100pp for XXX" you hear, the whole
basis of that section of the economy is vague by nature.
