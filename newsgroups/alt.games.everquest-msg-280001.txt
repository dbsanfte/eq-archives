	Even with no AA's (Is there such a thing as a 70 with 
NO AA's, not even basic stuff like healing adept?) all it takes
is an OOW focus item to make that level 66 heal worthwhile.  And
with full AA's, a good focus, and a crit heal it's essentially a cheal.

	My cleric duos with necros and wizards all the time, even before
Ward of Vengeance.  Cast elixir on self on pull, stun, nuke, and I can
generally keep aggro even when they start nuking.  If there's a real tank 
though the reason not to tank has nothing to do with cleric-ness per se
but simply that a real tank can manage aggro so much better.  Well, except
for anything worth killing :-) :-) :-) _real_ mobs still one round me.
