Try a group in the Raider room in HHK - much faster XP specially if there's
no-one in the Warrior room and you can pull them also.

Alternatively try Estate of Unrest (BB mtns -> Dagnors Cauldron --> Estate
of Unrest)
If you get a good group together there the XP flows nicely.  (Not a nice
zone to solo in though.....)

As the subject says, looking for recommendations on where to go for
further experience at level 31.

Looking for both groups (preferred) and solo (very weak tank)
suggestions.

Important point is that I have no expansion packs.

currently in Highpass, which is now maxing out on Goblins. Well, they
are not green yet, but exp comes glacially slow and I really can not
solo there.
