They are, as I noted, unable to get the expansion, being that Sony decided to
distribute in such a way as to prevent anyone overseas from getting it on the
"release" date.

Further, some people are going to not get it for economic reasons.  Sounds silly
to you and I perhaps, but $30 or in the case of non US citizens as much as $70
USD is outside the budget, and they have to hope for Xmas present or something
along those lines.

Both those issues were covered in my post.

I have been on a rain in the new planes, the only place where 100% of the
particpants can use the new /raid function.  Nice and all, yes, but even though
I purchased the expansion, I can't use the function in most of the things I'll
be doing for the next couple months, because from experience, I know that even
one key person not in the channel means that the channel gets discarded as a
badly flawed tool.
