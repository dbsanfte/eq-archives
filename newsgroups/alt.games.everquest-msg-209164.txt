I imagine that the corpse is the standard 30 minutes. Probably have to do
bids whilst CC and add killing continues whilst people take it in turns to
run to PP and hail and get loot. A bit like the CC groups at SSra emp.
Mezzing chanter wants the robe and wins so mezzes, runs like the wind, loots
runs back and continues CC hehe

Many thanks Martin and Richard for your advice, will persevere and we will
soon have some more evil timezone exploiting Euros in Elementals
