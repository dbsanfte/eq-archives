Still tinkering around with combinations for the Progression servers, I 
think next I'll try a Dark Elf Necromancer.

I know, I know, its been done.  But everything has been done.  I haven't 
played a DE past 5th level or so, though, and I stopped playing my one 
necro at 22 because he was too powerful; I think on this server, I won't 
mind that so much.

What, though, made me really pick DE, rather than one of the other Necro 
races?  Hide.  DE get it racially, which is important because 
Necromancers don't get it as a class.  Unlike invis, though, hide 
doesn't break.  Which means I can go afk for extended periods of time, 
even hours, and not have to worry about a roamer, or about being 
trained, at least by live mobs.

This wasn't important, back in the day, because of course doing so would 
kill your pet.  But now, with pets persistant across zone lines, and 
with invis not killing a pet, it can be possible to keep a pet alive for 
a long time... even up until you replace him with a higher level pet.

This means putting good gear on a pet can be worthwhile, because you can 
hope to keep him alive a long time and really get use out of it.

Will hide matter as much as I think, or will I find that its better to 
zone to somewhere absolutely safe, instead?  That I don't know, 
honestly.  But I'm not looking for a major advantage, just something to 
give one pick the edge in my personal "how should I do this" list, and 
while I like the Erudite newbie grounds potential a lot, the one necro I 
have played in the past was a necromancer.  SO, something different, 
even if just to me!

Oh, and I'll get to see the "new" Nektulous, the new freeport, the new 
NRo, and the (I've been there a few times since the change, but not 
playing a lowbie) new Lavastorm.  Fresh lands to ruin!

Lance
