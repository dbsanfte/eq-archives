Well, I don't know how you got away with it, but if definitely
happened to me, and I rang them up, and they confirmed that it was a
new 'feature'. It's also a completely different type of message box;
looks more like a standard Win 3.1 box than AOL's customised ones. 

Not only that, but I got a workround for it and when I'm playing DAoC
I can actually see the box come up and be dismissed, every 41 minutes,
regular as clockwork. 

>So..... it shouldn't affect online playing at all.

As I said, I don't know how you're getting away with it. Life is
strange, AOL doubly so.
