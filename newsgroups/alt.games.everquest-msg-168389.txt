Well other guilds can be mad, who cares about failures. Yeah we all would
like to see the mobs taken out so we can get a handle on spawn timers ect.
Failed attempts happen all the time, its part of the game. If that guild has
issues then they are one of the farming guilds on your server and let them
be.

EQ is a game, Life is real.... don't sweat the small stuff and best of luck
on your next attempt at AOW.
