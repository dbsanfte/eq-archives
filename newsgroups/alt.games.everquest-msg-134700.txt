With 250 skill and %mod to the cap supposedly at 252, your odds of success 
are rumored to be about 1 in 4.  There's therefore about a 24% chance of 
failing 5 times in a row (0.75^5).  Your odds of success are still 
probably 1 in 4ish.  If it makes you feel any better, the othe 
jewelers in my guild faced similar failure rates.  Personally, I 
failed on the pottery step.  Ouch!  You'll get it one of these times. :)
