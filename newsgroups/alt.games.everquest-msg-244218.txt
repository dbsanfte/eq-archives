Dont use snare or ensnare in groups to stop a fleeing mob,Tangling
woods does the job too,and cast time is only 
0.2 seconds.1.8 seconds more you can deal damage,it adds up
over time.

Try to get a Wakizashi of the Frozen sky,should be pretty cheap
and its a fun weapon at low levels,Oh and a haste item is a 
must-have at *any* level,you're a DPS-class.

For making money,farm Tradeskill components like Spider Silk,
Cat pelts and so on;check the Bazaar for prices of these,you
will be surprised.

As others have mentioned,forget about archery as a damage
dealing tool,until you are 65 with 45 AAs your melee will out-
damage archery,with the exception when you get discipline
Trueshot at 55 and have "Tolans Bracer".
Oh and no one mentioned,you need a elemental bow too,cost
at least 30kp,one could buy some really nice melee weapons
and a haste item for that much money.

...
and to the posters ,who mentioned mez breaking with arrows,
it has changed with the last patch,no more mez breaking,its 
enough now to assist the main tank and turn your
Auto-Fire-Macro on.   :)
LoS-issues have improved vastly too with the last patch,
if you dont get the "You cannot see your target"-message,
you can now be sure to hit the mob,unbeleivable after all
these years,but true!
