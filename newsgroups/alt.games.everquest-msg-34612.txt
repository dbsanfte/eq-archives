Yup, it does make a noticeable difference by the time you're 39 or 49...but
not enough at level 20 (when wizards get Spec) to really worry too much
about.  By level 30 it will easily be maxed, all by itself.

I've HEARD, but never seen it confirmed by anyone I especially trust, so
take this with a grain of salt, but I've heard it saves up to 1/3 of the
mana.

Now, keep in mind (and I DID see this officially), if a spell costs 700
BEFORE Specialization you'll have to have 700 mana free, despite the fact
that it may only cost you 500 mana to actually cast.  The mana check is done
before the Specialization check.  But this was WELL over a year ago that
Abashi or Brad posted the info...it's entirely possible they fixed it by
now.
