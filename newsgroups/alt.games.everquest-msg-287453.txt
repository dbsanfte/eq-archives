i hear you - we disagree on what my rights are as consequence of
having purchased the software

i'm saying i own it, and if i chose to connect to a private server
rather than sony's server, i'm within my rights

you seem to be assuming that i have no rights except those granted to
me by sony in the EULA, or you've misunderstood what sony's copyright
actually means


sony holds the copyright in the software and the content therein
(deathfist orcs, kaladim, etc), but because i paid for that software
i'm free to use it as i please *except for the ways specifically
prohibited by the law* (not the private agreement) -- such as
distribution, copying, public performance, whatever

i'm allowed to sell my eq cds, i'm allowed to make backup copies, and
i'm allowed to change the use to include connecting to a private server
