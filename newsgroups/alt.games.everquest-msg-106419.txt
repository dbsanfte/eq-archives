precisely for that reason.

	For what, five seconds?

	A grouped Wizard is going to have whatever level of Clarity is appropriate
for his level, and/or Bard mana regen.  His med time is going to be
insignificant.  (With either C2 or bard song, *I* can cast pretty much on
demand while maintaining a good mana supply, and I don't get to sit down.)

	I'm sure Graffe's has a lot of Wizards who can mathematically "prove" that
they're weak.  It's bullshit.

	Wizards make mobs die *now*.  That lets you clear areas faster, which lets
you pull more mobs.  It also not incidentally prevents all the damage the mob
would have done if you'd waited for the fighters to kill it, thus preserving
the healer's mana supply. 	Once the core requirements of a group are met
(someone to tank the mobs, someone to heal him, preferably someone to manage
the crowds), Wizards are excellent choices for damage dealers.  I have never
regretted having one in my groups.

|important is a different topic.)

	No, I'd say it's this topic.  If Wizards are the backbone of AE groups --
and the are -- that can earn experience five or ten times faster than standard
ones -- which they do -- then they don't have a hell of a lot to complain
about.
