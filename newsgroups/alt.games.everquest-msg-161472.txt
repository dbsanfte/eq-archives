Sounds like when Reagan said he didn't want people working for him that
would seek a job in the government, but rather those who could be convinced
to serve.  For more examples, visit your nearest DMV.

I would like to see a two-party system where the debate was between the
Republicans and Libertarians.  We can send all the liberals and communists
to Canada.  That way we have two versions of America, the free version down
here, and the big-government version up there.  If you're born in either
version, you have to decide which one you want to be a citizen of by your
18th birthday.

Recall that the republican "pukes" tend to be better constitutionalists than
the democrat pukes.

Actually, the republicans are much whimpier about opposing the democrats
when they abuse their power.  It's like the story of the last two
republicans, who are being executed before the firing squad.  They're asked
if they have any last requests.  The younger republican turns to the older
one and says "You know, I think I'd like a blindfold."  The older one
replies "Let's not make any trouble."
