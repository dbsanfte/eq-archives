ah k, I misunderstood sorry.

I remember when i first conned Statue (which was after the first time i'd
been on a raid that killed him) and i was gobsmacked that he conned blue.
You just learn not to rely on the colour con at the higher level heh.

> Not yet, but I'll suggest that for next weekend. Thanks!

Well I've just logged from pulling a kael raid for a small guild of friends,
so its still fresh in my mind heh.
Inside the doorway with the 3 prots (protectors) theres 2 doorways either
side, the mobs inside here (Cleric of Vallon Zek, Gkrean Prophet of Tallon,
and the Semkaks) will all give a challenge above the regular arena mobs (a
winnable challenge)

From there, try Vindi's guards (Temple guards, level 60, the pull will bring
both of them)
Assuming Vindi hasn't been troubled, when your puller agro's Vindi, the 2
temple guards will come running down the bridge to his side.  You can then
split these from Vindi, and try your luck with them.   It will be a double
pull though, so you need to split tank and be able to keep both tanks alive
:)

Alternatively, try King Tormax ramp.  Theres several giants here who con red
to me (at 60) and will help you climb the next step in killing the big kael
stuff
