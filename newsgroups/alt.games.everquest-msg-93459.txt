/pet sit tells the pet to sit in the spot they are located at at the time 
there is no fighting.  So if your pet chases after a runner and finishes it 
off, it sits down THERE.  /pet guard here tells the pet to guard that 
particular spot, after chasing a runner, they return to that spot.  I always 
use /pet guard here.  There are probably aggro radius  and resolution 
concerns twixt the two but I have not noticed them.

/pet follow me and /pet guard me appear to do the same though there may be 
some distinction on how the pet handles potential enemies.
