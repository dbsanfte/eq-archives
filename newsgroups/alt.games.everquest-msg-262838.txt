Sorry, kind of missing the point.  How does the University of Illinois 
invalidate his claim that people call him the father of computer gaming?

Yes, there were computer games before Scott Adams.  Scott Adams, however, 
wrote one of the first widely-disseminated computer games.  I myself 
remember playing Scott Adams' adventure games on a PDP-8 at the Oregon 
Museum of Science and Industry back when I was twelve.  I don't ever 
remember hearing about anything called PLATO.

Your experiences at the University of Illinois are irrelevant.  It's Scott 
Adams that got universal acclaim for his games.

He is not claiming to be the first person to ever create a computer game. 
He is being called (by others) the inspiration for a whole generation of 
computer game programmers.  Scott Adams influenced a whole lot more people 
than PLATO ever did.  That entitles him to the "Father of Computer Gaming" 
moniker.

This isn't a contest, y'know.  =)
