EVE has had a bit longer to get things working in production.  I
expect that in a year and a half (which is how long EVE has been out),
EQ2 will be much like EQ, i.e. up pretty much all the time except for

The level of detail in EQ2 is far beyond what NWN has, unless you turn
all the graphics options way down.
