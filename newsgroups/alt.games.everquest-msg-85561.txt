Criticising one part of a product is not disliking the whole package.
An analogy would be having a car you like, with a crappy
dealership providing you service. You enjoy driving it, and being
in it, but dread what happens when something goes wrong.

I like Everquest, or I  would not play. I am not bitter. But really,
you have to admit that GMs and guides are basically ineffective.
Not because they are bad people, but because the system under
which they work is flawed.

I could afford to pay the fee, but I will not. One way tickets to
unproven servers is not my idea of fun with my high level chars.
If it is for you, knock yourself out.
