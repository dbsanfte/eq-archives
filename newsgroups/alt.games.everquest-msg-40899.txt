Its a problem of laziness, familiarity, and static spawns. 
One or really both of you, if you own kunark, should instead be in the
lake of Ill omen frontier mountains overthere area instead. The
problem you describe is the reason that for the most part kunark and
velious were done a lot different. I could honestly not design a
better way to cause players to contest a thing than a big landmark
spire thing with like 3 gnolls spawning around it. I mean, who the
heck thought that up and thought it was a good idea?

Other players are rude out of desperation. The respond to the design
of the game by making an "I own this camp" assumption. He is assuming
that you are the rude one since he is saying its his camp. You are
really just following Verant's rules. You are therefore right, but
there is really no winner in the game you are playing with that other
player. Your best bet is to get the heck out of Dodge, or in this case
the old world overly camped areas.  


>this is the first time i had a problem with this and im level 36. i think the

Ah, you can skip lake of ill omen then, lucky yoU, and move directly
to the overthere zone in kunark. Its a really great zone which instead
of static landmark mobs has plenty AND to spare near a hill and zone
at the opposite side of the evil city. It can really support quite a
few groups with constant killing and from what I've seen really very
little kill stealing (most of it being accidental really) Because of
being in the "land of milk and honey" the players in Overthere are
quite a bit nicer too and warn each other about the guards being out
and such. 

36 may be a good level to go to velious also, with just tons of wild
mobs or FANTASTIC experience kodiaks in great divide which are really
quite undercampedmost of the time and are in some caves.

There are screenshots, but they are not submitted as evidence at
Verant's request. If they don't see it nothing happens, if they do see
it a GM comes and says you have to share and everyone involved ends up
feeling a bit stupid. Best thing to do is move on and go to many of
the fantastic newer areas in the game where no one is claiming some
guy who spawns at a rock or in a hut. They taught us sharing in
kindergarten but evidently its hard to make that stick ;)
