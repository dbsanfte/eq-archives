Also bear in mind this is a pre-Kunark quest and when itroduced, was the TOP
Ranger nuke. Same as Ice Comet, and Tashania are both pre-Kunark quests for
(at the time) top end in that classes spell lines.

CoF is a melee spell... low cast time, high delay... good for a Ranger who
like to mix it up... and back then, you wouldn't have had the mana pool to
go chain casting for very long, anyway :o)

Firestrike is a caster spell... longer cast time, shorter delay... good for
Druids kiting (lvl 39+)
