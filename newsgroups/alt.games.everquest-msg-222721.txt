Yes its a very old paradox. :)

But its a silly one.

The issue with omnipotence is your interpretation of the definition of 
it. Specifically, that an omnipotent being can do 'anything'. Including 
anything conceivable, and even anything inconceivable, that he can even 
do something that *by its own definition* cannot be done.

ie...

Can God write a formal proof that (p -> ~p) in standard
propositional logic?

Can God write the english word 'team' using the standard roman alphabet 
without using the letters 't','e','a', or 'm'?

Can God express (not approximate!) pi as a rational number using our 
normal base 10 decimal system?

Can God make a burrito so hot...

Requiring that God do something that is by definition not doable is a 
silly requirement.

A far more useful and reasonable interpretation of omnipotent is someone 
who can do anything 'that can be done'.
