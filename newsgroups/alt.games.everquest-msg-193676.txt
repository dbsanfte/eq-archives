>Is Bot group flagging working at the moment?

Last I heard, BoT wasn't group flaggable, The way it was explained to
me was that only the zones where quests were an alternate path (to
killing raid mobs)  for flags counted worked with group flags. BoT
didn't qualify since it's the only way to get into the zone, CoD and
HoH would qualify.
