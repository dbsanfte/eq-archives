I've done no testing of this sort, but I've never seen any "phantom mana"
vanish on casting a spell with my cleric with a bard in group.  I've also
never had anyone comment "hey, what happened to half my mana bar?" when I
do a hardcore mana pump, even when they've gone from no mana at all to
full bar after a particularly hard fight (honestly, practically the only
time I bother doing this).
