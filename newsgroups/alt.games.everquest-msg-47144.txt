    Always wondered about this. When hasted, is your delay an exact integer
number of tenths of seconds, or is the figure exact? I'd assume rounded to

    More specifically, if you want to spend your time in the old world. Most
of Kunark you're like everyone else, and in all of Velious you're like
everyone else (with some very minor differences, like Rallos Ogres and
Trolls in Kael or enchanters/bards in Velketor's).
