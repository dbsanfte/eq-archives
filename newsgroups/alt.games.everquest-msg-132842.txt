has anyone died at the hands of someone / something called 'Pain and
Suffering' in S Karana? I zoned my 22 erudite necro in and got the following
message:

pain and suffering tries to hit you but misses
pain and suffering tries to hit you but misses
pain and suffering tries to hit you but misses
you have been knocked unconcious
you died
Loading please wait etc..

Who or what is pain and suffering?

Anyone got any ideas?
