The recent patch mentioned that some things that used to
work in a regular Sewing Kit will now work only in the
Coldain sewing kit.

Question:  Are the pelts (2 HQ Cougar, and 2 HQ Tundra
Kodiak) which must be combined to make the Blanket for
Garadain (the start of the Coldain ring quests) one of
the things that now will work only in the Coldain kit?
Or do they work only in the regular Sewing Kit?

After I've spent many many hours finding the pelts,
I do *NOT* want to screw up the blanket (I've already
got my Tailoring to 115 first).
