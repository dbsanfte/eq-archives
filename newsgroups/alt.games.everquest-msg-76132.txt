If you are on the bridge in EW, or on the coast just north of the bridge,
when you bring up track it looks like you can only see a small number of
mobs. However if you scroll down you eventually see more.

Now, you can select one of the blank lines between these two groups of mobs,
hit track, and find out " is ahead and to the right" which puts them in the
ocean somewhere. Is there a reason for this? Is there anything out there? ;)

It has been like this for several months at least, I only just got curious
enough to try tracking one of the blanks ....
