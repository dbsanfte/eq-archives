   Yeah, I was in that channel for a couple of days.  Then one evening I
noticed my chat screen was being filled up with "cream" referances... I
can't even call them jokes.  Mainly consisted of linking cream, saying
"of", then linking another item. "Cream" of "Charred Sheid", "Cream" of
"Champion's Helm".  Not even good one like "Cream" of "Tunare's
Finest".  I logged off the channel and haven't missed it any.

   At least when you see joke links in the age channel they tend to be
funny.  "Gloves of the damned dirty pot smoker" and "Spell: Grow
Tunare's finest pot" come to mind.
