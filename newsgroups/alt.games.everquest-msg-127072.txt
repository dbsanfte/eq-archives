}We don't get the fact that the 'proddies' go to look at something that they

No, that's entirely allowed.  But as I said in my other post, people who 
are only gonna be there to check out the new thing may not be the best EQ 
citizens...

}What we don't get is why this would surprise some one. It strikes me as
}stupid that someone could be surprised by that. and since they know it's
}gonna happen, maybe they should stop whining and deal with it.

Nobody said they were suprised.  They said they were annoyed.  There -is- 
a difference, you know.

}just my 2c.

2c stil doesn't buy much, does it?
