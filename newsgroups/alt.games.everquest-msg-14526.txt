If you agro a mob of that level and are still untouched 15 minutes later
you just may be using an invalid tactic.  Not a hard and fast rule, but
its something to start with.  If you need more hints, here is one I use
to explain how you can tell if you are exploiting pathing.  If the mob
moves away from you to get closer, you may well be in a position that is
exploiting the pathing.  If you repeatedly move between two spots
causing a mob to run back and forth in an attempt to reach you and then
moving back again so that it never reaches you, then you are
exploiting.  These are two simple examples of how common sense can help
you to know if you are or aren't exploiting.  They don't cover all
cases, but they provide an example of how anyone can use their own
common sense to tell the difference.  

Of course a true exploiter will tell you now and forever that it just
looked like he was intentionally exploiting pathing for hours, killing
mob after mob while never taking a single point of damage.  Cheaters
disable their common sense along with their ethics before logging in and
so are pretty much unaware that they are cheating.  That goes a long way
towards explaining why the Cq folks seem so genuinely shocked to find
out that their "sploits" got them in trouble.
