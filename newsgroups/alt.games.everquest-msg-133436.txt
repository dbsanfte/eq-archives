Yep, that would be a fair description.  In game terms, you get a
buff type icon that you can't click off, and several of your stats
take a major hit.  The buff stays on for a while, while your stats
gradually come back up to normal.  Then it finally wears off and
you are good to go once more.

The buff takes the normal str buff slot, so you cannot be str buffed,
and one of the major hits is to Str.  Under rez, a relatively weak
character may find himself unable to move at all till the effect has
had some time to wear at least partially off.

There is a trick for getting rid of rez effects quickly; get yourself some

additional damage some HP gear or an HP buff, then zone.  All
buffs are removed when you do this if you do it right... including that
pesky Rez effect buff.  Whether its worth bothering is another matter,
since you'll have to zone twice to get back to what you were doing,
and depending on your system rez might well have worn off on its
own during that time!

Revive is no longer the no exp rez, I think... but anyway, yes,
any "cleric "port you to your body" spell will put you at about 20% hp,
no mana, and Rez effects, whether it gives you back any exp or not.
