On the other hand though, if you plan to mainly be a guild/grouping
shaman then Iksar shaman has one HUGE advantage:

By the time you get to the old plane (fear or hate, forget which)
where the iksar only shaman armor drops you'll probably be the only
iksar shaman there. When my guild does hate or fear TONS of iskar
shaman, warrior and sk plate drops rot. As an iksar you'd be in old
planes armor in no time and its actually better than the existing
plane armor for iksars. The DD JBB thing is probably a concern for
later than that unless you are twinking.
