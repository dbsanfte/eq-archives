Ya know, I missed most of this thread, but reading this post, I have to 
agree with DT.  And, as a player that only started a year and a half ago,  
there is a ton of content that I haven't seen yet, but plan to in the 
near future.  If SOE quit making expansions for EQ today, by the ime I 
get to the "new" content, there will be so many fighting over it 
(instanced zones excluded), that I would have a hard time getting the 
enjoyment out of the game I get now.

But, by all means, if the enjoyment is gone, take off.  But quit the 
whining and bitching and moaning and....you get the picture.  And while I 
admit that I haven't read the entire thread, from what I HAVE read, some 
of the comparisons given are absurd.  

I for one shall continue to play until they either shut the servers down 
and delete EVERYTHING, or I get "done" with it.  If an expansion seems to 
be a waste for me to get, I won't get it till I'm ready.  If I don't like 
a "feature", I won't use it...same as now.

That's all.
