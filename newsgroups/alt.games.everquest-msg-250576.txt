Be fair, it IS a bard we're talking about.

But no, I won't be able to do it nearly that fast, bard solo ability 
drops off in the mid 50s since charm has a max level for its targets, 
and I don't have a pile of high level friends to group with... been most 
of a year since I've been on that server, you know.

Grouping with random pickup groups I wager it would take me a month to 
do those last few levels, maybe more, what with the quality of play I've 
seen recently in the 50-65 range.

What about it though, is Maarten right that desirability of bards is way 
up these days?  I was a half decent bard, could hold down a 4 twist with 
a 2 juggle fairly consistently, and function as CC in situations that 
don't outright require an enchanter... I'd have to reacquaint myself 
with the class to get back to that level of course, but much of its 
still in muscle memory.
