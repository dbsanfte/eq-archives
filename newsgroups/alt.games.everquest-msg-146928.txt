A newbie so me floating around yesterday and asked about the spell and 
stuff and i asked if they wanted to have a go.
Anyways to get to the point we were jumping off the top of erudin palace 
cliffs and floating down towards the docks
The said it was the best fun theyve had so far in the game, might have 
been sarcastic though but they seemed genuine.
I do think to genuine newbies its great fun. 
I remember when i was a newbie and someone cast it on me, i couldnt wait 
to find high ground.
Maybe i need to get out more :p
