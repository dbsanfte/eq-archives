Hi there
having a problem with my card and Lords of Everquest.
Running AMD 1700 256mb ram radeon 9200
Worked when I first installed XP pro but since installing other
software (inc service pack 1 and 2)the game just hangs intermitently.
Please can anyone help as I bought the game for my boyfriend and he
knows nothing bout computers!
Thanks
