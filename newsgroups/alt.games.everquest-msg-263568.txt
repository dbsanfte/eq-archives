I think the biggest problem with EQ2 is that it is not EQ1. It's hard
to break the habits you learn after several years. What makes it worse
in a lot of ways is all of the simularities. Place names, NPC
references etc. All of which lull you into thinking you are playing
EQ1. Then when things don't work like players excect based on EQ1,
they get frustrated. It seems like the majority of complaints are
centered on class roles in groups based on what people have ingrained
into them from EQ1.

Once you get past your pre-conceived notions and accept the fact that
EQ2 is really a completely different game, things get much better.

I've been in beta a few weeks now, and EQ2 seems to have a lot of
depth and charm. Simply exploring the game world and interacting with
the NPC via quests, is exponentially more fun than EQ1. I personally
can't wait for a live "Roleplay Preferred" server to launch.

The only thing I see as a "problem" with EQ2 is that class development
is very linear. Equipment restrictions and other design decisions
ensure that players fit into 1 of 4 roles...Priest, Mage, Fighter,
Scout. No single class is the "best" at anything. This solves the EQ1
issues with Cleric/Warrior/Enchanter behing the holy Trinity, but it
also dilutes all of the classes and removes a lot of the "uniqueness"
each class in EQ1 had. Like I mentioned above, I am most likely a
victim of my own pre-conceived notions based on playing EQ1.

I think EQ2 will be a huge hit. It will most likely have a rocky
start, but from what I have seen it has enormous potential.
