I am sorry to hear that you have had such a rough time of it.  I play on the
Terris Thule server and haven't had the same experience.  As a matter of fact,
people have been surprisingly generous.

When I was a rank newbie (I hadn't played an online game previously), I stuck
to the newbie zones (in my case Qeynos).  I have only been playing 2 or 3
months and my cleric is a lvl 11.  

I find when I go back to Qeynos for a bank run or whatever, I am innundated
with newbies begging for something,  I have no problem helping people.  I have
a problem with people demanding help. 

If I had seen you go to a bandit camp, I would have helped you (or warned you
about where you were going).  I got killed by a bandit mage last week.

P.S Sow is a spell that Druids and Shaman have called Spirit of Wolf and it
causes you to run faster, it is very popular with people who have to run a
distance from their bind point to where their body is.
