I was in Hate just the other week.

Standard break-in really:

GROUP 1: Cleric got to West wall camp and managed to camp.  Monk FD.  I think
the rest of the group died.

GROUP 2: All died (not sure why this happened, monk must not have checked for
pathers).  So dragged and rezzed.

GROUP 3: No deaths, CoTH to safe spot.

GROUP 4: No deaths, CoTH to safe spot.

The Deathrot Knight didn't path onto us, he was pulled with the rest of
the ground floor mobs in turn.  The Safe spot was indeed safe once we
were there.

Mobs tend to come in groups of 2-3, just a case of FD splitting them.  FD
splitting the Maestro from his clerics required some dancing with two
different FD pullers, and was fun to watch. :)

The Evangelist of Hate is still annoying.

Same as you remember it?  *grins*

Tris.
