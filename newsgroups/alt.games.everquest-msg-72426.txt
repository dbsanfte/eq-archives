... is so non-intuitive to EQ players. Maybe I'm wrong, but these are some
of the things I have observed while trying to get my lvl 4 Elementalist to
lvl 5. (she was lvl 2 when I started, about... 3 hours ago) In EQ, I learned
fairly quickly when to run. I knew, without a doubt (from the first time it
happened) that I couldn't take on 3 fire beetles, but that I *could* take on
one and possibly 2 and not have to run, though it might be pretty close...
(I'm thinking of Misty Thicket here for the most part, but insert your own
city/zone) Yes, I played a *lot* of starting characters in MT, but I also
played a lot in other cities, so I think this applies, anyway... It isn't
just a matter of memorization of the mobs and what they do/how they do it, I
don't think, but maybe in some sense it is. Maybe if I play around in
Camelot enough, I'll find the method to the madness...

Anyway. I died about 50 times (and I am NOT kidding) tonight, just trying to
get my lvl up. I kept killing *blues*, which the manual recommends (as does
the EQ manual) (actually, I kept -trying- to kill blues). Some of the blues
I faced, such as lions and forest cubs, were -much- much worse than the
other blues (such as spriggans). Yes, I know, pretty much the same as in EQ.
But there seemed to be no -sense- to the whole thing. You could guess, *once
in awhile*, whether you might take out the *same* critter you had just
killed, and be -totally- wrong, or be SO right that you battered the
helpless thing into mush. There seems to be no in between. And the thing
that pissed me off the most, I think, was that there seemed to be no
recourse to dying. You either kill the thing or you die. That's it. No
running for your life (unless I'm seriously mistaken) (and *no*, "Sprint"
doesn't take the place of running/jumping to the guards) Maybe I'm just used
to having the safety of the guards being not terribly far away if I get into
trouble... seems like a sensible conclusion. Guards, if they exist in
Camelot, are far away and few in between, and I haven't even been able to
test whether they might kill the mob that's beating on you or not.

Conclusion: I'll stick with my ever-beloved EQ and sample the somewhat
dubious treasures of DAoC only when I'm so bored that I can't bear it for
another hour. Won't happen that often, I expect.
