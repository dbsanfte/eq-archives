So your suggestion "I do hope you have installed those Via drivers." on
an Intel chipset makes you a Troll? I guess this being usenet, I should
have spelled it out in fine detail. Yes I am frustrated. I have built
systems since the 8086 days and know that the hardware is usually not
the culprit. It is either firmware on the hardware, or drivers, drivers
being the most common problem. In this case I believe that the drivers
are the problem. The Ti-4200 works fine, and as an aside, I called the
person I gave my dinosaur system to and found out she had replaced the
Voodoo5 in it and still had it in a box. I popped over, brought it home,
installed it and it's ancient drivers on another system, installed DX9,
fired up EQ and it worked. I'd try my Matrox cards, but the best I have
is a 16MB Millenium G200, so I'll pass on that test.
