I did that briefly, but found I needed the spot for a bag more than I 
needed the instaclick SoW.  In the very rare instances (maybe twice) that 
I needed the instaclick, I opened the bag, pulled out the boots, swapped 
them into a main inventory slot, clicked them, and swapped back, all 
while running.  The instances where you need that very slow SoW to outrun 
a mob are so rare as to not be worth it.  If that SoW can outrun the mob, 
then strafe running almost certainly can as well.  I got run1 at level 
58, didn't get run3 until level 60.
