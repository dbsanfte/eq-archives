had all that info.

So, lets take a look at where you'd expect it to be featured:

http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/index.vm

which is where you go when you hit Home, or go straight to the web site 
from the login.  Anything?  No.  A note saying that for current game 
update info people should go to the Forums page (the one above?)  No.

So lets try the logical place to look for game update info:

http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/game_updates.vm

The updates tab.  What do they know?  Nothing.  As far as they are 
concerned the most recent update occurred on 7/25 and they have no info 
about any upcomming updates.

http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/servers_index.vm

is the tab marked servers.  No good, that just talks about what the 
names of the various servers are and what type they are and gives links 
to their individual forums.

How about this one down here, Network Status

http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/network_status.vm

hey that works!  Well not really, because secretly I happen to know that 
  whether the servers are up or down isn't the critical info, the 
question is, when they come UP again, are they open to the public or 
just to SOE techs doing their minimal testing.  But it sure looks good. 
  At the bottom we see the message:

Scheduled EverQuest Server Maintenance - 08/14/2007 4:00 am
Downtime Update
All EverQuest servers will be coming down at 4:00 AM PDT (-7 UTC) on 
Tuesday 08/14/2007 for an update. Estimated downtime is 8 hours.

The EverQuest Operations Team

OK, guys, the forum page, where you'd only look by chance or because 
someone told you, has more info than this.  It would take LESS effort to 
copy the same info to both places than to write seperate and less 
informative text to go here.

This isn't brain surgery.  Or, as it turns out, Brraaain surgery.
