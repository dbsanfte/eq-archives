As a shaman who solos in sebilis, I'll invite you to kiss my ass about what
I can and cannot tank, thankyouverymuch.

Up until warriors get defensive, monks tank better. Unless you are talking
massive twinkage. Pity you don't know this.

Yes, they are.

Considering a monk gets hit less than a warrior against any sub-60 mob, I'd
say monks do a pretty damn good job of it.

It is sad that you are sucking a fucking moron, celt.

Monks can EFFORTLESSLY out-taunt a warrior, unless that warrior is
dramatically higher level, or vastly better equipped (say, their rage of
vallon epic primary, and a priceless/primal velium warsword offhand, and
even then, a monk using the bo staff of trorsmang will have to turn his
autoattack off periodically to avoid being the primary tank).
