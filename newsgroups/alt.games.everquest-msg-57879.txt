  Has anyone ever not Zoned when trying to zone into Kurns? Three times now
I've ended up in this little room with what Looks like some sort of Wizard
Spire or Teleport Pad instead of Zoning. If I looked around the Corner of
the Wall I could see everyone at the entrance before you zone and they could
see me but if I went to far forward I would pop into Kurns. It said I was
still in the Field of Bone as well ( makes sense since I didn't zone).
