Persival

Sadly, nothing that simple.   In the end I found a link to the site
where one can change the password.

Someone on the EQ support web page reckoned that my account was
'hacked'.  I am not too sure about that because the password was a
very peculiar one and also none of my characters has been moved.

I just expect that some server somewhere managed to throw a wobbler
and corrupt a few data records.

Anyway, I have a new password and I am off and running again.

Thanks
  Malc
