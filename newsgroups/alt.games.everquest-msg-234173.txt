You dont need to hail him. Say to him "I will test the machine" and you will
receive a character flag.
When you hail after a win, always only hail once, since extra hailing will
use up someone elses flags.

If the little spiders are getting into the behemoth room, then the aoe will
kill you fast. Your resists should probably be a bit higher but I wouldnt
worry too much.

This is how we do behemoth. Have 2 groups in each of the 4 tunnels leading
to MB room. Have them kill spiders until MB is targettable. Then you leave
an enchanter on each corner to mez any spiders that come along, and everyone
else kills behemoth asap. 1 spider is like 4k aoe, so enchanters need to be
good.
