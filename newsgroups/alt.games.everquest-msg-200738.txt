Don't know where you get that. There are several people here who share my 
opinion.

It doesn't help your case that so much of TheDownTimeWhiners[tm] (cha-
ching, kaev) crowd is made up of short-sighted, lazy, quick fix, short 
attention span, twitch types who are perfectly willing to show a complete 
disregard for what might be in the best interests of the game in order to 
make things easier for themselves.

It is *not* good for there to be so many level 50+'s.
It is *not* good for people to fly through the levels this fast.
It is *not* good for cash cows to exist to the extent that they do. In a 
fantasy setting (which EQ is, let's not forget), an enchanter hocking KEI 
in the manner they do in EQ would be demonstrating *zero* self-respect 
and grace. They would be viewed to be no better than a two-bit whore.
It is *not* good for low level characters to have the advantage of god-
like (for their level) buffs and gear. It creates an aberration.
