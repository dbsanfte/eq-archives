Thanks Bergh, for another great tidbit.

I've been playing over a year now and didn't know that.
I've been using "jump" to cancel a spell but will try "duck" in
case its faster.

I met up with a chanter yesterday who couldn't reach an Orc on top of
a hut to loot it.  She'd never heard of using the /loot command to squeeze
in that extra few feet of looting range.

amazing what you still don't know about after a year or so of playing.
