Remove Curse will work on it, but takes about 5 casts to remove enough
curse counters.  Remove Greater Curse works in 2 casts.  Highly
recommend you have at least one (if not two) casters with this spell
dedicated to removing the curse on your MT.

Yes.

Also, we've found that chain stunning him works wonders for reducing
melee output and stopping his curses.
