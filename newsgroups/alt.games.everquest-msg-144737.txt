Yes it is a valid argument and no it does not apply to individuals.
Individuals are the only entities that DO pay taxes. Any tax you think you
are collecting is always comming out of someones pocket. Most of the time
this tax is collected from consumers (higher prices of product). Some of the
time due to other market forces this is instead collected from the owners of
the buisness (sub normal profits), or from the employees at the buisness
(sub normal wages). Note that owners whom you are supposedly trying to
punish for the evils of running a buisness and employing people while making
something consumers want , really dislike losing on their end and if their
end goes down much the common thing to happen is for the buisness to end so
that they can invest there capital elsewhere.

And no you take the best job you can find . It is really nice when this job
manages to provide all that you need and some of what you want. This
situation is normal for americans, and abnormal for a great number of people
. It is entirely possible to die slowly, and really quite common if you
examine other cultures without the advantages of a capitalist merit based
society.
