Hi,
Where is the best place to Level up with a level 32 Druid and a level
33 Monk.
We have been in Unreast since 20 but things are light blue now.
Looking for a place with a good XP bonus!

Also I have heard rumers that if you are level 50 or higher you will
be able to port some things to EQ2, Is this a Urban mith or will you
be able to use something from EQ when you move to EQ2.
