Pre-Luclin models the 24th level pet was the first pet that was Dark
Boned, in other words it was brown. The pet was also the same size as
the first level pet. Luclin models changed that so that there are no
longer dark boned pets, hence your pet looks like the 1st level pet.
By the time you have a 49th level pet, it will be the same size as the
20th level pet.

My question to you is, 500PP?! You can buy that spell from SK guilds,
shouldn't cost more than 12 plat or so.
