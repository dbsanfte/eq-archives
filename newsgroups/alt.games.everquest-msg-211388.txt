according to charles darwin, homosexual pairings provide excellent child
care/raising

(i don't care what darwin thinks, but darwin's work has more often than not
been constructed to argue against-<whatever name summarizes people who are
not white, are not straight, are not <insert political faction>,  are not
'modern', etc, and the word 'normal' will NOT suffice here>, yet in this one
issue there are no two ways about it)

(besides, who really believes in science anyway? people who think they're
too smart for religion, but too emotional for plain philosophy?
c'mon.........)
