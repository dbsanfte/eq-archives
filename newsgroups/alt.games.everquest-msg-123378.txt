I love killing mobs while naked on the way to my corpse when corpse
running.  And if I get trained I just press that button that says
Feign Death on it.  Monk of course.  This has to be the easiest class
to get the first few levels with.  Proceed to your guildmaster, give
note, equip ghetto guild item, attack guildmaster, spawn at killing
fields, start beating up everything in site that's black or lower.
Iksar has the added bonuses of incredible regeneration and
infravision.

Second I think would be a cleric.  Clerics do not look for a group,
groups look for clerics.  All they really have to do is buff and heal
(and make a hotkey for "Heeeeeeelp there's a (target) on me")
Although starting out with this one is a little harder than with the
monk.
