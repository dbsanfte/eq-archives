No it was like 1st mostly and some minor second. I think first is
redness, second is blistering and worse, third would actually be skin
damage -possible removeal and grafting. Normally heated liquid would
not be enough for third unless it was actually fully boiling like when
a kid pulls the handle of a pan of boiling water on a stove. Even then
I don't think its quit third.. more like second with possible perm
scarring.

Anyway, it was overturned by  a later court (the 50 million or
whatever award) last I heard and downgraded to medical costs I think
and possibly more. I know their coffee is hot but holding it between
your legs is kinda goofy...
