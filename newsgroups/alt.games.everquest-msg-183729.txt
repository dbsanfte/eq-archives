Well that's sad but even more so I was fighting with a twink froggy and had
put a couple of very expensive items in one of my summoned bags temporarly
just before we got kicked, worth around 150k in total.

I know they are lost and gone forever cause basically GM's don't give a fly
hoot who loses what to a system crash or any other problems for that matter.

So tell your hubby what I lost today in items would probably be worth a
weeks pay or more to most people, that should make him feel a bit better
:( lol
