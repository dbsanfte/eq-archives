There are quite a few AGE players on FV of various levels (me for one). I 
know that there have been attempts to get people from here together 
previously, but it is always worth another shot.

I'm a 34th (finally) level enchanter. Give Treelore a shout if he is not in 
the bazzar and that's the sort of level range you are. I'm in a small 
family guild, but we have level ranges from 20 through to 52 so there may 
be something open somewhere.
