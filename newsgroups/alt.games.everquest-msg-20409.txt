>This maybe the case, I do not know, I'd like to see where you got this info.

	Lotsa log parsing, and lotsa lurking on the Warrior forums on
http://eq.castersrealm.com and http://eq.stratics.com.  The Stratics
forum used to be THE place for learning about how the melee combat
engine worked, but it's not nearly as high-volume as it used to be.
The Casters's Realm forum seems to have taken up the slack, however.
It's a high-traffic message forum with some very clueful posters
there.

	Very little, if any.  Mostly, higher ATK = higher value for
MAX damage.

	This isn't Star Wars, so don't trust your feelings, Luke.  =)

	I've seen too many logs where a 45th level Ogre Warrior with
200+ STR had the same hit ratio as a 45th level Gnome Warrior with 110
STR.  And once you hit 28th level, that hit ratio seems to be around
60%.

	Yes.  I've tested this myself with a log parser and a
stopwatch.  I do indeed swing 20% more often with an FBSS than
without.  (And I swing 30% more often with an RBB than without.)
