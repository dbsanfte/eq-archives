Senior Necro Pet beats Red to 30  target down to 3% /pet back of , FD,
JR Necro kills.  Cleric and shaman/chanter provide slows and heals as
needed(shouldn't be)  shaman pet can also be used but must be used with
/pet get lost.  Rinse/Repeat,  Chanter can also try memblur/mez, but
apparently thats been broken for a while.
