Umm... you seem to be very short sighted.  No, we go raiding for everyone.  
Everyone is benefitted by a well equipped tank.  The next time we got back 
to HoT, it gets easier, more mobs killed in the same time, more armor 
drops in general.  Instead of 5 plate armor pieces drop, the next time 
it's 10, because you killed twice as much.  Therefore the guild ends up 
with more Skyshrine armor for the time spent.  Yes, that includes armor 
for non-tanks... it includes plate to clerics bards and paladins (no we 
don't have any SKs).

And this wasn't even a case of all plate going to the MT.  The breastplate 
went to the MT.  Other pieces were dispersed to secondary tanks, further 
pieces would have gone to clerics but we didn't get that much.

No, but the way in which the player leaves can hurt.
