One more point about the Evade skill. It can lower your hate enough so that
the attacking MOB will disengage and start pounding on innocent bystanders
or other pullers.  In the Dreadlands on the north wall, I was the puller
(read Jboots and no Sowers) and would pull the mobs back to the group. I
would hit evade as the mob approched so they would go for the tank.  If the
mobs were too far awhile when I attempted evade, every once in awhile, they
would head over to the next group as their puller and I had sometimes
crossed paths. Kind of funny at times as no one got hurt. (we would go get
em back)  I don't think they ever figured out why it was happening either as
they kept saying that they wernt Kill/stealing or nuking.)

so be carefull when evading by others

I used to use evade when taking (Mobs gone bad) to the guards to help them
get argo and me stay alive. (highhold keep and GD)
