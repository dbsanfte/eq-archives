Well, there's the sleeping dragon in EW, but some say he's just a
statue.

Use invis and an experienced guide to get thru Kael Drakkar, then turn
right and follow the zone wall, unless he's dead (rarely) you'll come across

Rolandar before you reach Skyshrine.  While you are there, go ahead
thru skyshrine (invis is needed, but a guide isn't critical, since none of
the
things up on the top level see invis) and into Cobalt Scar, where you
can pick up your CS fang off the ground in the dragon ring... now you
can be ported to any ring in velious.

Thurgadin, like Firiona Vie, suffers a -negative- faction adjustment
for wolf form.  If you aren't at least amiable, don't go puppy around
the coldain... and always ask your groupmates before you group puppy,
because thats a good way to get people killed by surprise.
