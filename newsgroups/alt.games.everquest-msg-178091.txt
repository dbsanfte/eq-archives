I've done it numerous times where I'll be playing and the sound of fighting
will wake me up and I'll realize I've been asleep for a few seconds. The
strangest time though was when I was waiting on the shuttles to move in
Butcher so I could go to FV. All I know is that I wake up on the sofa near
the computer, come to the computer and my character is autorunning into a
wall at the docks. No idea when I got up and moved to sleep...or why I ever
turned autorun on. Just weird. :)
