Welcome to the wonderful world of pets.  Yes, all other classes with pets
have the same type of problem.  Depends on the zone.  I don't know about the
BL class, but I am assuming that at sometime you get the "Summon Companion"
spell which can be bought by the Erudite vendor next to Shady.  My Mage
keeps this spell loaded when they are in a zone with bad pathing.
