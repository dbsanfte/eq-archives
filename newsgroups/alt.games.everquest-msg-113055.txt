Aha - someone who fights in the Deep - just the person.

My regular group is looking for new places to do a bit of
XP grinding, and we're looking at the Deep as an option,
any hints as to good places to set up shop in there? Mob
selection?  (always 55 ranger, 55 druid, 54 mage.  The 
others vary abit - but 53 wiz and 53 ranger are pretty 
regular too.)
