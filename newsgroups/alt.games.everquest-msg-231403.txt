I don't remember exactly when, but I remember very early on that you
needed a gm or guide to get your corpse if you could not click on it
when you died on a small hill. So /corpse did not work for dragging at
that time. I don't remember when it did exactly, I just remember that
it was very nice. I think it was in the game before fear and hate were
added. I just know that when the tribunal server started, that was the
first place I remember /corpse dragging and it seemed like something
new. That was when I went to a new server and my character on my old
server was never high enough to do the planes so I can't recall
/corpse on that one at all. In any event, this would have been in 1999
sometime.

Then they changed it to allow the dragging, later they changed it so
that /consent ONLY let people drag you with /corpse (no looting.)

Its a bit hard to find when /corpse was around to drag, since
EQcaster's realm doesn't go back to when eq went live. Its news
history starts a few months after that.
