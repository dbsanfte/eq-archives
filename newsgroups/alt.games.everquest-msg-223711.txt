JBoot speed is actually better for kiting as well becuase your speed is
closer to that of the mob you are kiting as well - selos tends to be too
quick and you can easily pull out of range very quickly, especially if you
are chant kiting with a drum equipped. AoE kiting would be near impossible
without SoW/Jboot/Tboots ( em: boggle )

I find AoE kiting on the spirocs not worth the trouble anymore btw, as with
just Denons Disrupive Discord (level 41 now) it takes so long I cannot
maintain the required perfect  concentration so have switched to charm
kiting and things are moving along very nicely still.

The ultimate in luxury though is the one key Chant kiting afforded by the
JBoots. Ie,

/stopsong
/cast 1               <--Chords of Dissonance
/pause 25
/stopsong
/cast 2               <-- Tuyen Chant of Flame

With my Selos Drum of the March it delivers 79damage per tick. When I hit 46
and get Tuyens Chant of Frost I will have to figure how to combine the
'pause' command on the same line as the 'action' so I can do one button 3
chant kiting. I seem to have trouble doing this ATM so will need to research
the correct syntax.

With the above setup even someone as terminally inept as myself can raise a
bard solo to 55ish given enough time, though charm kiting is definately
quicker. Of course what I am missing out on is valuable knowledge on how to
group the bard, but then I specifically avoid groups and crowds in general
because I am under no illusions over my competence level. It's OK to drink
as long as you don't drive kinda thing.

The other thing I wan't to try later on is a wizard, again twinked with
JBoots as I have become somewhat addicted to to the AoE : )
