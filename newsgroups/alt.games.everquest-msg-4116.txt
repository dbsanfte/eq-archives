Recheck Everquest.com, they've updated the patch message:

Just a few notes to clear up some questions and some errors in the patch
message.

** Food Changes **

Along with the other changes mentioned in the patch message, some
player-made food items will now have an effect on your character beyond just
keeping him from being hungry. We'll leave it up to you to discover the
rest.

We've also added the ability to right-click food to 'force' your character
to eat it. This will cause the food to be eaten immediately (though your
character can only eat so much food at one time). Food eaten this way will
only last half as long as food eaten naturally by the character.

** Run the Velious Patch **

If you want to see the new Monk textures you will need to make the changes
mentioned in the patch message. But you will also need to run the Velious
Patch in order to get those textures to show up.

** Skewer Change **

We didn't actually change the weight of Skewers, we changed the weight of
Spits. Sorry for the confusion.
