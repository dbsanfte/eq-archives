| DAoC is not "dedicated to PvP". For the first 15 levels or so it's player
|vs. environment mostly and after that you can participate in realm vs. realm
|play. You can still play vs. the NPCs though (which I suspect will still be
|most of the game).

	The PvE portion of the game exists for no reason other than to level up
PCs for PvP play.  The company's own website makes this clear.
