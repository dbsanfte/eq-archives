Correct, The Silver Griffon and you're lucky he didn't stick a Darkness on
you to ruin your escape, he's an SK, low 40's.
I killed him pretty easily but as I travel with a druid and 'chanter (both
also 52nd) as bots so it went something like,
engage with warrior, slow with Enchanter, snare...snare...oh sod it
Warrior (with SLN, SLTW, Thorns and Chloro) kills in short order
Without the slow I prolly would have needed at least one heal.
My Warrior can solo Grimfeather, unbuffed and alone...wouldn't try the same
with Ol' Silver, considering the first thing he did was HT me for 400 odd I
wasn't going to let him melee to full effect as well.
