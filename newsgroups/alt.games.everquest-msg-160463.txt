I think Australia is too small for its own server. Europe (with more then
500 million inhabitants) is a lot bigger.
However, with the large number of Japanese and other Asian players I
wouldn't be surprised if a server in a somewhat similar timezone will be
planned. You would of course have to learn Japanese as the Japanese like to
speak Japanese on EQ :)
