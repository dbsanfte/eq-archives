Heck, for the past few weeks, I've had a really rough time finding groups 
as a shaman.

But seriously, I can count on one hand the number of times I've been in a 
group where anyone cared if they got a druid vs a cleric for the main 
healer.  I've been in many groups where we've had both a cleric and a 
druid, the druid just switched to a nonhealer role for the most part.  
Druids are quite versatile, and can fill any numer of niches in a group.
