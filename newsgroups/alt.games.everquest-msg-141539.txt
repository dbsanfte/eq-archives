Your mistake is in assuming that the reason people are offended by 
swearing is that a particular string of text crossed their monitor.  In 
fact, the reason it offends people is because the words are either being 
deliberately used to wound or insult, or from sheer thoughtlessness.

The diference between

Fuck you you fucking sonofafucking bitch

and

kjse you you asejung sonofawesning qwnit

is not so much that we can't tell you're swearing, you realize.

If you resort to such a string, odds are it's because you're in a dispute 
with someone... and oddly enough, 90% of the time, the one who feels the 
problem can't be solved without swearing is also the asshole who's causing 
the problem.  So strangely enough, you get petitioned for it, and you go 
bye-bye.

Now, if you say '/g argh! askwing KSing guards!', the odds are pretty high 
your group will be sympathetic.  But don't push your luck.
