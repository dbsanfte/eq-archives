But, it is the Out Of Character channel, it is specifically intended for any
and all Out Of Character communication, which by it's very nature is not
part of the immersive environment.  If they switch to using Shout or
Auction, that is another issue, then they are misusing a communication
channel.  If you want to remain immersed in the environment, I would suggest
turning off OOC and Auction at the least, as both are intended specifically
for uses that are not part of being immersed in the environment.  And, no, I
do not hold long stupid conversations in OOC or Shout or Auction.
Personally, I would probably agree with you that they are self absorbed,
immature jackasses, but I would then turn off OOC or /ignore them, not
petition about them using OOC for OOC communications.  You can petition
anything at all that you want to petition, that does not mean that anything
will happen as a result.
