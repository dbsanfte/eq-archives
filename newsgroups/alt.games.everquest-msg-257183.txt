Are you suggesting you personally did not think it had to do with
that? Because its been suggested seriously before (elsewhere), it was
wrong then, and its wrong now.

1 To vary within specified limits: ages that ranged from two to five.
2 To extend in a particular direction: a river that ranges to the
east.
3 To extend or lie in the same direction: �Whatsoever comes athwart
his affection ranges evenly with mine� (Shakespeare).
6 To live or grow within a particular region.

See anything remotely resembling the context you were hoping for in
there? And popularity has nothing to do with it. The word is as I said
it is.

It's not a valid reason. So if your connection is "rangers should be
thought to weild bows because people are too uneducated to know where
the range in ranger comes from" then Mission Accomplished!

Nothing. The question was why rangers were thought of as archers. An
answer was given, and, as I just proved, the word "range" has nothing
to do with it, and so we wait for further ideas. Nowhere has anyone
stated that therefore "melee" must therefore be the reason rangers are
called rangers. You've fallen into a bifurcation fallacy.

The absurdity of using such a statement is legion. You are in fact
suggesting that rangers are called rangers because they move around
while fearkiting or bowkiting. Such a claim is just plain outright
stupid. You are not a stupid person, so don't do that. And don't give
me any of that "I am just trying to find reasons to justify my
definition" crap either.

Ironically its not even particularly true in an EQ context. I do move
around while fearkiting if I am meleeing, but not if I am shooting.
Unless the mob is highly MR I usually root it if I am bowkiting and
again, I don't move.

So what? Many of the classes in no way resemble the actual definitions
of the word. Bard is probably the worst (best) example. Not only does
the EQ bard have no relation to its real life counterpart, but its
players are prevented from even doing its EQ defined niche (bard
social skills) by having to twist songs to the point of not being able
to type (and the idea of twisting songs is ITSELF an absurdity!). And
again, D&D is to blame.

You seem to have truly and utterly screwed up in figuring out the
point of this subthread. You should go back and reread. I asked why
someone thought a ranger should be using a bow. You seem to have
gotten it into your head that that means I said a ranger is defined by
being melee. This is a classic bifurcation fallacious argument.

You should have thought of that before you tried to do that yourself,
if you recall. As for me, I only did to show the lack of any
indication of "bow" in any of its proper definitions. In effect, I was
following the advice you just gave, and you weren't... that is rather
ironic.
