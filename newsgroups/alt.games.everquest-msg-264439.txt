Nah, my wife got her beta account just as I hit 20 on the Beta1 server, so I 
started a new character with her on Beta2. I enjoyed it so much I rolled the 
same exact character over again. So I have two level 20 Dwarf 
Mystic/Scholars. ;-)  This one I play now on Beta2 is actually an Alchemist, 
I kept going with tradeskills a bit longer than I did on Beta1.

I don't know where you've been hearing this, I haven't seen it at all. I 
don't know anyone who's quit in the 20's. I'm sure it happens, but in the 
guild of 300 on Beta1 in which I was an officer, and then again in the new 
community of hundreds that I've met on Beta2, I've yet to meet anyone who 
stopped in their 20's. It does slow down then, no doubt about it. It should. 
You're thinking of City of Heroes, happens a lot there.

That's because it takes a lot longer to level in EQ2 than it does, say in 
WoW, where you have lots of level 60's running around posting on the boards 
that they're not sure what they're going to do next. There are level 40's in 
EQ2, I know several, but I don't think anyone has hit 50 yet. There's no 
shortage of ways to get experience, I think it's just a slightly longer 
curve for gaining experience in EQ2 than you have in WoW. Blizzard will 
probably tweak that after release, but maybe not. They may be suffering from 
the same kind of inexperience that Verant was when they claimed that it 
would take 2 years for anyone to hit level 50 in the original EQ. They'll 
learn. ;-)
