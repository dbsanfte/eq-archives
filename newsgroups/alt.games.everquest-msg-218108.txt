Except...

High end guilded people will be able to do normal missions more
quickly than Joe Casual.  They can even do hard missions if they are
masochists and possibly get nice loot off the mini named and _better_
augments than Joe Casual.  The normal/hard RvR is a bit out of whack
on LDoN points but hopefully they will fix this.

High end guilded people can add LDoN augments to their _already high
end gear_.

High end guilded people can get LDoN _raid gear_ and augments which
are, as you'd expect, better than what Joe Casual can get.  Immensely
better from what I've seen.

High end guilded people have access to stuff that you'll never get in
LDoN.  Hi AHR neck!  Hi KEI clickie wand!  Hi clickie root pants!

Disclaimer: I like LDoN.  I added a lifetap to my _raid obtained_
mainhand weapon which would have been impossible before.  I was making
about an AA per hour spent in LDoN dungeons, not the best ever but
very acceptable.  The petty cash and cash loot was decent.  I never
did get an augment I wanted but others did.  It was fun.  For a while
anyway.

About 90% of the really high ranking names on our Leaderboard are uber
guild people - being charitable they could be said to be 'driven' more
than other players and I've yet to see anyone with enough points to
build _anywhere near_ your fantasy outfit as detailed elsewhere.

I see you play on $tormhammer, please feel free to share your
character name and Magelo so we can bask in your LDoN uberness?

PS: At the moment you're currently in the dunce's corner with the
Nukemeister.
