Hi all

I builded a small intranet at home and I share my internet connection by
masquerading and routing all internet traffic to an outgoing ISDN
connection.

Does having several verant EQ account online from a single IP cause problem.
How can whe play that way in familly. My older son and my husband would like
to play togather. We may buy additionnal EQ accounts if this is possible
from a single IP. We can't afford two distinct internet connections at once
though.
