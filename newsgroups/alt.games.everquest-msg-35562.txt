Since you're 8th level on a limited budget, there's a few top end ones that
are right out the window for you, but some others are much easier (and
cheaper) to get hold of. The two that immediately come to mind are the
tentacle whips that drop off the tentacle terrors in Najena (probably five
plat, auction in lavastorm or just try the merchants there. Adventurers
usually dump them off as not being worth the hassle of trying to sell them.
You could go into Najena itself and auction too, if anybody is in there
hunting them.) or the gnoll hide lariat which drops off the tech mas gnolls
in SK and Paw. Again, auctioning in that zone(s) would likely get you one
pretty cheaply.
