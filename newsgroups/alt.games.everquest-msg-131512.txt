Obviously you're not involved with law enforcement or Emergency
Medical Services. Suspects or patient descriptions are always given as
"Black" and never as "African American". Many Blacks find the term
"African American" highly offensive, in addition to being inaccurate.
Even Whoppie Goldberg has stated this numerous times on her show
"Hollywood Squares". They had a contestant several months ago who was
White but born in Africa. He made the statement that technically, he
was "African American". Whoppie started yelling "See, that's what I've
been saying all along".
