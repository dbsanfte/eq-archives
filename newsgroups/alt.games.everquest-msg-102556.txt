It all depends on the person, I suppose. I've been playing this game more or
less consistently since the day it was released. There was a time, spanning
perhaps a year and a half or so, where I didn't do much except go to work
and play EQ. But even then, I took time out to go out with friends now and
then. And, I've yet to call off of work or schedule vacation or personal
time for the purpose of playing EQ.

Over the past year, on the other hand, I met my wife and had a little boy,
and consequently my playing time for games in general has gone down
drastically, and I rarely play EQ for more than 10 hours a week, where
before I could mostly play without limit. Even so, I keep my computer desk
right in the living room so that even while playing EQ or another game, I'm
still close with my family.

I've been a gamer since the good ol' Atari 2600, and will encourage my
children to be gamers as well when they reach a suitable age; I'll certainly
advocate gaming for them over sitting glued to the trash that American
television spews on a daily basis. But as wilth anything, be it video games,
music, horror movies, or chocolate candy, there comes a point where it's
time to say "whoa". That time usually comes when the game, etc. replaces
your life.
