Yep, I played a mildly twinked warrior (had about half my shaman's gear) and
didn't see a lot of people looking for him in groups, shaman is much more
welcome.  A very gear dependant class, you'd want the twinkiest warrior you
could find.  On the other hand, with moderate twinking he was easy enough to
solo with; get twice the HP he "should" have, kill mobs without taking more
than 50% damage, bind wounds back  up to 50% and repeat.  At lower levels, at
least, BOA was the equivalent of KEI, a massive shot in the arm as far as
bindable damage, with a long duration.

I could certainly go faster than I am.  What it does is -allow- me to fly
thru levels quickly, but I'm spending a good deal of time doing inefficient
things, playing around with different play styles and approaches.  Once I
have a good handle on how things go at a given level, I go nose to grindstone
and get to the next tier.

It also makes me feel powerful, something I enjoy.  As a cleric, I liked
soloing because "they said it couldn't be done".  As a druid, I liked taking
on nothing but red mobs, going to zones 5 levels before common wisdom said I
should and soloing there (sometimes doing it naked just for the fun of it).
As a bard, I ended up soloing in POP zones at 45 not because it was the best
experience, but again because they said it couldn't be done.  Heck, come to
think of it when my cleric was 2nd level he fought in Eastern Wastes,
leveling up to 6th on snow bunnies, untwinked.  Why?  Because its There!

Twinked out, I'm capable of taking on challenges as a shaman that feel like
accomplishments.  Are they?  Well they are always going to have an asterisk
next to them saying "done twinked".  But on the other hand, I've found I like
the feeling anyway.  Killing reds twinked may be as easy as killing blues
naked, but its more satisfying to me.  YMMV
