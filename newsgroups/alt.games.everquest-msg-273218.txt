    Nothing wrong with that.  I don't play EQII either, so I tend to
skip over posts that have that in the topic.  I finally got around to
reading this one because I know that I enjoy Bob's writing style, and
indeed, I found the post interesting mainly because of that factor.  But
I can certainly see how the starting post wouldn't be interesting to
quite a large number of the members of both newsgroups, particularly the
c.s.i.p.g.r crowd.

   I've post many more than my fair share of flippant posts.  I think
that part of the reason for the reaction that you, and the others who
commented negatively about the length of the OP, is that Bob's post
wasn't just a run of the mill, hastily jotted down message to usenet. 
He obviously spent allot of time writing it, and put in a good amount of
thought to make it an enjoyable read to those who are interested in the
topic.  

    It is very, very easy to skip over a long post that isn't of any
particular interest to you.  It takes more effort to send off a snide
little barb about it as you do so.  In some cases this might be well
justified.  However, in the case where someone has taken the time to
write an entertaining, lucid, and on topic to both newsgroups post, then
yeah, I can see how a little pissy-ness is justified.
