Hmmm, I know I've run from near the Frenzy room in Lower Guk through a 
full respawn all the way to zone.  I was spamming my "Train to zone" 
hotkey as often as I could hit it, and still wiped out at least half a 
dozen people at the zone.  (My IVU dropped about 10 seconds after I left 
Frenzy room.)
Then there was the time I tried to pull the castle guard in Velks lab and 
wiped out the Village, 2 spider groups, and everyone at zone.  I saw it go 
bad, told everyone it went bad, and got stunned by a damn spider running 
to zone out, so they got all the way to the zone rock at least before I 
zoned.  
I suspect my best train was trying to do CR and train Sont away from ToV 
enterence.  I had to drag corpses from the DN zone to ToV zone, and train 
Sont away, which led to me having 6 or so WW wandering mobs, Sont, and 
most of the static named dragons following me at once.  I had to do two or 
three laps of the scar while shouting, oocing, guilding, and auctioning 
train so that nobody got hit.  
We do have a Fear raid planned for next week, so I'll get a chance to pull 
some really big trains.  The guild record for a single pull is 24 mobs, I 
plan to crush that record.


> TRAIN THAT YOU PERSONALLY WITNESSED IN GAME:

Level 30 or so, soloing and duoing in Mistmoore.  Two high level 
characters 
cast on the pet that you can target near the zone line.  The entire 
castle emptied out.  Myself and a 30 warrior did our best to bash all we 
could.  Eventually zoned out, then back in.  Pile of dead mobs like I'd 
never seen before.  One of the mobs had a Mistmoore Battledrum on it, back 
when that was a great item.  The high level guys gave it to me for 
standing and fighting as long as I did.  Also got Lute of the Gypsy 
Princess off the same guys on another similar pull.

> TRAIN THAT YOU EVER HEARD OFF:

Anytime my guildleader calls out, 'INC a couple of blues!'  We have a 
pretty crappy screenshot of one such instance:
