You get 1 point for every full 15 minutes of raid time on an
officer-sanctioned raid. You get a 2-point bonus for
arriving on-time for the scheduled raid start time (raid
porters get the on-time bonus free). The timekeeper who
records and posts the attendance and on-time statuses also
gets a 2-point bonus.

When there is a drop, all primary (non-twink), 55+ classes
that can use the item may silently bid up to twice what
their point total was prior to the start of the raid. All
bids that fall upwards of half the highest bid may roll what
they bid. The winner pays a price equal to half the highest
bid (and gets the item). If the item upgrades a droppable
item, the obsoleted item may be offered as a separate
auction, with the point cost going to the person that
offered it.
