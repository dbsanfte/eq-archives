An unasked question is "How good is Hawkeye?"

My wife plays a ranger and hangs out at the ranger glade board a lot.  The
general consensus is that hawkeye currently isn't worth the mana to keep the
buff up.  IIRC, someone did some log analysis and found that it has
very little effect on accuracy or amount of damage done.

Maybe Verant will improve it later.
