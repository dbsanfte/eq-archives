If the druid is kiting *through* your camp, the druid is an a-hole and should
be /petitioned for training.

Assuming the druid kited these too close to your camp *and* the MOB aggroed on
you, I would agree that you should defend yourself and even kill the MOB. Not
sure what a GM would say.

If the druid kited these close too your camp and the MOB ignored you, but you
attacked anyway--I would call this a KS. So would a GM.

>If I take back creatures the druid took, its not KS.

If you mean you have already engaged a MOB and the druid pulled it away? Then
druid attempted to KS you.

If you mean a MOB that spawned at a spot you claimed you owned, the druid
pulled it first, and you "took it back", you just KS'ed the druid.

Well VI policy states nobody owns a spawn. So if a druid and your party are
pulling from the same spawn points, it's first come first served. Attacking a
MOB someone else has already engaged (even you claim you own the spawn) is
KS'ing.

Now good manners and common sense states otherwise. Good manners state that
you should respect others' claims to spawns. Common sense states that if two
parties are vying over the same limited supply of spawns, then both parties
are losing xp.
