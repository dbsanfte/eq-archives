Depended completely on where we were fighting and the makeup and ability of
the group.  A blue in 2 hours doesn't sound that far off though,
unfortunately.  (on average)   East and South Wings of Howling Stones, maybe
1.5 hours per blue or less.  The Grey near Shassra temple, three hours for a
blue.   A lot of it was done in Maiden's Eye, which seemed about average for
experience.
