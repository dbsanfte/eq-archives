As a mage I definitely wouldn't start AA at 51.  Level 53
brings a very group friendly pet (air), and Boon of Immolation,
as well as char at 52.  Personally I'm headed to 54 (1.2 blue
bubbles left :) then switching to all AA at 54.  54 is a 
sweet spot in magician power, with a water pet that backstabs,
and many of my favorite XP haunts still available, it seem
like the best time to pause and pick up some AA points, build
up some cash for the really spendy spells to come in the next
2 levels (CoTH and Trans. Rod = 10-12k together).
