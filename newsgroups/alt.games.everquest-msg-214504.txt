I went in with a Paladin MA, ranger, druid, mage, bard, and me (shaman).  
We did the 90 minute kill the boss mob in the Mistmoor dungeon.  It was 
tough, but, even with us screwing around, we managed to complete it in 
time.  The group was not a seriously well equipped group, SS quest armor 
and scattered other stuff was about the level of equipment.  Levels were 
60 to 65.  All in all, I'd say they got the difficulty just about 
perfect.

We lost all but me and the mage while killing the boss mob.  We managed 
to pull it off anyway.

We got 5pp out of the one chest we opened, and the boss mob dropped cloth 
shoes.

Only encountered one, was not a big problem.

We did have that.

Bard lulled us past a number of the mobs, Paladin IVU-ed us past some as 
well.  We killed enough mobs to spawn the boss, then only killed what we 
had to in order to reach him.

Paladin had to zone back in, get COTHed to me and the mage, then rez in 
the rest.

Mana never became a serious issue for us.

We did get two nice drops, a chain bp, and a shield wieldable by most 
classes.  Both were minor upgrades for me, but I lost the rolls.

We got about 400pp per group member, one +6 MR augmentation, and a nice 
BP and shield.

Would not surprise me, resists of the mobs in Mistmoor did not seem to be 
high.  I did not have to debuff most of them in order to slow them.

I had a blast, but did not think it was as hard as you indicate.  I did 
it with a pickup group that I had never fought with before, and we 
squeaked through our kill the boss mob adventure.
