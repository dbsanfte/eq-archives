Except that you already had a level 49 rez, and the only NEW rez that they're 
adding at the levels where is would ever matter is the level 44Cleric/55Pally 
75% rez.  In other words, this has VERY little effect on the type of person who 
is going to be exploring empty zones without a fallback.  
People who hold out for a 56 cleric over a 49 cleric sure as hell aren't going 
to be wanting to take a LOWER rez.  I also can't think of a single high-level 
solo zone that doesn't have clerics passing through regularly, though *maybe* 
there is one in Luclin.
Who here has honestly eaten a death because they couldn't find a cleric post-50?  
Not because you fell asleep and the rez timer expired, but because you couldn't 
find at least a level 49 cleric passing through in 3 hours?
