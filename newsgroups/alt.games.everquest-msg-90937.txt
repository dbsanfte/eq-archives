I had crashing problems with it and so did a good bud of mine.

Hi, my name is Zymyool, and I still code in PASCAL.  Well, Delphi, but you 
get the picture.

Oddly enough, I ran a State Government BBS for a while ( O.R.I.G.I.N.S. - 
now on ethe web at: http://origins.ou.edu/ ), and everything was coded in 
PASCAL and the Database Toolkit.

I would.  I'd rather someone else toil and sweat away the hours on it while 
I'm playing EQ =)

Then again, if there's Codewarrior for Linux ( don't remember ), I could do 
both at the same time... hmmm...
