I think its your platinum buying pond-scum buddy (or is it sockpuppet? I 
haven't bothered to look... but it would fit the pattern...) is the 
social idiot that society has no tolerance for.

See... he posted a socially idiotic thing... and I as a member of 
society couldn't tolerate it. QED.

Where does that put people who just open their mouth without thinking 
first? Right at the top of your list!! If you find those the most 
enlightened and desirable people... well...whatever floats your boat.

We've already established the sort of brainless people you think are the 
*most enlightened*... so I'm not putting much stock in the rest of your 
observations.
