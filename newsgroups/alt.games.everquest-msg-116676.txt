Agreed Unspoken word is not the greatest of spells but with a 1 sec casting
time and with Upheaval thats 1200-1400pts of damage from 2 AOE in a very
short time. Nice thing is they both will kill damage all mobs with in range.
Working in an AOE groups thats great damage. Remember you are a Cleric (a
Healer) not a Wizard.
