Some people, including many in the US government, appear to see
Israel as intrinsically good. Not even the bombing of the USS Liberty
made a difference to this position. Whereas the Arabs appear to be
seen as almost sub human. 

With this kind of attitude it's hardly suprising that people
like Bin Laden can find followers. From their POV the US is
a "great evil" both from the position of supporting the "rogue
state" of Israel and the hypocracy of claiming to support a
set of values whilst doing everything possible to oppose
those same values in the Middle East.

Hardly suprising, considering Sharon is a war criminal...

Strange how the same people who won't talk to Arafat,
on the basis that he is a "terrorist", forget Sharon's past.

Israel didn't exist in WWII, it's creation involved acts of
terrorism, too. Including, IIRC, suicide bombings.
