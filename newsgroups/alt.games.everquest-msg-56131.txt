I am a lvl 22 druid and was soloing in NK.
I was fighting a beetle of some type and the battle
was turning ugly.  I was going to win, but was wasting
mana and HP.  All of a sudden a wolf came walking through
and started attacking the beetle.  This made it easy to get
myself organized and kill the beetle.  Why did the wolf do this?
I pretty sure it wasn't a person in wolf form.  I thought it was
a mistwolf.?  Has anyone seen this before or can explain it?
