I don't know for sure, but I would guess the survey in question was a
"website survey". One that people happening to pass a website opt to
answer. These, in most cases, have no checks to make sure each person
answers once or even that they answer honestly.

Yes, the larger the sample the better the chance of a more accurate
reading, but it's still not definate. There's still a chance of having
a highly skewed result. It gets slimmer, but it isn't eliminated. I
somehow doubt more than a couple % of the player base answered the
survey we refer to. I never even heard of any questionaire that asked
questions that would net those results myself.
