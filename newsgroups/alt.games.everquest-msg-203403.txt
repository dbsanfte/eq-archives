    Ditto. I remember when it was just me and my small group in Kaesora oh
so long ago. That was fun as hell, knowing that we could go anywhere and do
anything without anyone bugging us or getting in the way.

    The way they describe it, you'd meet at the instancing NPC and he'd tell
you roughly where in the old world your dungeon is. You'd go find the entry,
go in, and have your own adventure.

    Of course, it won't all be happiness and sunshine. In the latest text
files sent out with the last patch is a line saying something like "All
dungeons are full. Please try again later." Given that these dungeons have
no respawn, it'll be interesting to see what is done to stop morons from
camping a character in a dungeon to "reserve" a dungeon slot until they get
a group.
