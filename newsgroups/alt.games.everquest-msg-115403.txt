    You're certainly welcome to your opinion, Wolfie, but I
can't quite agree.  As far as I know, nobody in here is
trying to level, do quests, or sell off items (well, the
last is a bit questionable).  In other words, this isn't the
game, it's a newsgroup, and everyone's post is an exercise
in self-expression, or even self promotion.  I don't feel
that's inappropriate, but it's fine with me if you do.
   Now, if I started a new thread every time I leveled any
of my characters with the title "Ding!", then you might,
IMHO, have a more valid point.
   As to why I _do_ do it.  I like to be accessible in the
game.  Believe it or not, there are alot of people who lurk
here, don't post, but pay attention to those that do.  More
than once, I've been greeted in game by people who have read
my posts, and because of my sig, knew who I was when they
saw me in the Karanas or where ever.  Also, I feel it gives
a bit of context to my posting.  If someone asks a question,
and a reply, they have a clue as to my possible level of
expertise.  I think these are good enough reasons to do
this.  Again, it's more than fine with me if you don't.

Annie <--- More that a bit amused that someone would
consider my pointing out that my highest
           leveled character, after more than a year and a
half of play, is only level 30, as
           a form of bragging.
