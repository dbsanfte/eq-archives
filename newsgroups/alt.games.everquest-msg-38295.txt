I've spent a lot of time building up a Shaman, exclusively with 1H Blunt.
But now want to build up his piercing skill as well.  But, even though I'm
killing things, I don't see his skill improving.  I've been killing bear
cubs for the skins even though they don't give me exp.

Do I need to fight mobs that give me exp to see the skill level go up or
what?

Any help here would be sorely appreciated.

Thanks.
