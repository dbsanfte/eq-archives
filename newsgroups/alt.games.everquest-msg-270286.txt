Perhaps WoW isn't too worried about the PL freaks, and doesn't want to 
punish the average player just to keep the PL freaks in check.

Perhaps it just proves that getting to max level can be done in 500 
hours played. If so, cool, that will take *me*... 6 or 7 months. Which 
suits me just fine. :)

Agreed. Hell... EQ1's direction wasn't apparent until the 3rd or 4th 
expansion. Or... EQ1 shifted direction around the 4th expansion... take 
your pick.
