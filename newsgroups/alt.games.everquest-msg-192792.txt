Warriors are usefull but 51 is a really crappy level . Taunt is mostly
broken and never did work above your level which completely removes all
planes from hunting choices. Your best chance is in sebilis , karnors, or
velketors for the next *10* levels. He is still at twink levels which means
95% of the server wont even look at him.
