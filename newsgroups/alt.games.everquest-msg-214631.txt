Yes they have a better table but it is a VERY slight improvement I would be
suprised if this accounted for more than a 5% dammage advantage. Monks
outdammage warriors from the use of special attacks and this can be
substantial but is largely eliminated when both classes go uber and wield
the very best weapons. (A 300pt kick looks impressive untill both parties
are routinely hitting for 500 anyway) .A monk will gain double attack and
dual wield faster and max the skill around 30th level while a warrior takes
till 40th . So at 30th a monk may look good briefly but since the caps are
the same the diffrence completely vanishes.
