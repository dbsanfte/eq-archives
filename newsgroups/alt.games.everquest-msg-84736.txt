This first open signup for the Legends Service is capped at 8,000 subscribers.
Given the current size of the EverQuest game world and our experience with 
subscriber to online player ratios, we feel that this per server number will
lend itself to a healthy community, with an average online player count in 
the 2,300-2,400 range.

2,300-2,400 isn't what I would call empty. It's closer to what I
would call crowded, especially considering that it's mostly 
experienced, hardcore players at or near level 60 who would be 
willing to shell out that kind of dough, I imagine.

I have to question their estimates, though. With only 8000 accounts,
they expect to average 2300-2400 online? That means they expect close
to 30% of the player base online at a given time, in other words,
they expect the average player to spend over 7 hours a day on 
this server. Even for hardcore players, isn't that a bit high?
I suspect they mean "average player count during peak hours".
