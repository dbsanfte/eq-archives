Err, yes, well, there is that.  And I don't really believe that Verant is
making any religious statements.  

I personally would love to see a clerical system where clerics of
different gods actually had different abilities/restrictions.  If we want
to follow Earth/human mythology, why not give worshippers of Erollisi Marr
the ability to use bows (they could have some special cupid-like charm
arrows).  Worshippers of Tunare might have a slight tendency towards some
druidic abilities.  And so forth.  Being a cleric could become much more
interesting.  Not that I've played a cleric past level 3. *cough*
