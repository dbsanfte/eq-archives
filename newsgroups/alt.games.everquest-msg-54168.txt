O my, I am even newer than you (less than a month) but through research (on
the net) I chose (as a druid halfling) to do tailoring. I plan on doing
halfing cultural armor so I will also work a bit on brewing (for the acorn
oil) and blacksmithing (for the other items required).

I was weird I guess.  I started fishing and tailoring waaay early.  I
scraped every copper I had together (At level 2) to purchase my sewing kit
and fishing pole and used the fishing pole to fish to make a little money.
Even when forage stinks, bait costs 4 copper each.  If you sell the fish you
catch they're worth 1 silver each (in rivervale).  (Which is huge to a level
2 character who isn't twinked).  So, with that profit I bought my sewing kit
and the patterns I need.  There were lots of black wolves in the misty
thicked that supplied me with ruined wolf pelts:  I had myself outfitted in
patchwork armor in no time.  Saved me a lot of pp in the long run, didn't
have to buy armor piece by piece and the patterns are usually only a few
silver each.

I've also outfitted a few newbies in patchwork armor, just to increase my
skill.

A lot of kind people helped me out (not financially, but by giving me items)
and now I'm level 14.

IMHO, tailoring is cheaper to learn as pelts are relatively easy to come by.
What little blacksmithing experience I have tells me it is more expensive
and you usually have to buy your items from a vendor (which is always more
expensive).  They say brewing is cheap if you forage the items you need.

Ultimately, what you choose depends on you.  If I were a wood elf and used a
bow I would take up fletching.

Has a lot of information on all the skills to help you make your choice.

Good luck,
