If you don't try everything in order to see what combinations don't work
the way you wanted them to, then you are failing to understand the
idea behind testing.

Lets say we did automotive testing this way.  Ok, looks like a good
driver can get in, drive along the track, stop in front of the office
mockup and get back out.  Works as intended.

What happens when we slam into the side of another car?  Gosh,
driver up and thru the window, decapitated?  Well we didn't think
of testing for accidents, just for "best case" scenarios!

Note that until the mid 60s, this was exactly the plan, by the way,
it wasn't till then that the idea of Safety testing came into vogue.

Not looking around for ways that players can deliberately steal
from each other means failing to even try to protect the normal,
trusting, honest citizens of your game.  There will, in every
community, be some dishonest folks.  Now if you are yourself
honest, you might have trouble thinking deviously enough to
find every loophole... but you aren't doing your job if you don't
even -try- to break the system.
