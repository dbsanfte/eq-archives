Consent allows one to drag the corpse.  You can consent someone who is
off-line to DRAG the corpse out.  

To SUMMON a corpse out, the necro has to target the character who has
lost the corpse.  If the toons are on the same account, the necro
can't summon the other toon's corpse because he can't target the other
toon.
