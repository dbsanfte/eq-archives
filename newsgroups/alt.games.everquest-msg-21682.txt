 """Constant pulling and watching the clock and keeping track of what is due
to
 spawn and where the spawn should be is a puller's job.  I depend on
 you, the cleric, to manage health. I'm too busy managing spawns to
 ever consider my health, I completely trust you to do your job."""

Any tank that does not realize the importance of the cleric has no business
being a puller. When I pull, I always listen more to the healers than anyone
else, especially the "little" tanks (e.g. hybrids) who keep yelling "keep
pulling! don't stop!"

 """You have got to tell me to stop pulling or I won't.  sorry, but I'm
 tracking spawns and watching the time.  You track my health, your mana
 and watch my  health bar.  We'll constantly pull blues and we'll make
 damn good experience if we both do our jobs right."""

I go out, pull one mob (if at all possible), bring it back to the group. We
kill it, then I run to get another mob. (haven't been in a chain pulling
group yet). Yes, you need to tell me when you are OOM, or I will keep
pulling. Once I see those letters, I sit, and ask the cleric/healer to tell
me when they feel comfortable, and wait for the "pull" message. And a good
group will also realize that the puller is the actual leader of the group:
we control the pulls, warn of incoming, and if the puller dies, guess who's
next?

Oh, and one last thing: if the puller stops pulling, there is a reason. If
you get bored, don't run out and find something else to pull. It just
compounds things.
(true story: killing dervs in WC, when the OOM pops up. I stop pulling, but
the rogue gets bored a decides to pull something from behind us. She does
... a train of young kodiaks. She's running around yelling for help (gee, a
tie in to the original post), while I am trying to pull mobs off her, and
the cleric can't heal her because he's LOM. She didn't die, she ran over to
the druid rings, and some higher level ppl helped her out. But it cost us
time, and when we were finally ready, the derv camp was full, and we knew
there would be a train)
