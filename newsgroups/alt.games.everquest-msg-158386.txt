Sorry if I came across as suggesting he was being a baby about the whole
thing. I was more coming at this from a "seven stages of grief" kind of
angle. Ingot feels hurt that his usefulness to his guild, his group, and
others has dropped dramatically. *I* don't agree that it has, but that's
not the point. I was simply trying to suggest a more pragmatic approach
to it.

Realize that PoK ports almost certainly won't be going away; that druids
likely won't be getting any compensatory abilities to make up for their
(apparent) loss of utility. Work through his loss by crying himself to
sleep, punching holes in the wall, joining a support group with other
players, whatever works for him. Then accept it and move on.

In time, he might find other ways of being useful. But it won't happen if
he isn't looking for those ways. And in focusing his attention on his
(perceived) loss, he isn't looking for those ways to be useful. And wasn't
being useful the whole point of his choosing to be a druid in the first
place?

I apologize if my intent wasn't clear from my prose. Writing clearly and
unambiguously is a decidedly nontrivial undertaking.
