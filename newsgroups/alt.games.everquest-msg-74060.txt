Well, I've been re-reading "The Hobbit" the last few days. And even though I
read and absorbed the book years and years ago, I find myself somewhat
impatient for the action to begin, so I do have to admit that I know what
you mean :) I also do have to disagree on at least one point, however (and
that's merely a matter of taste, I certainly am NOT flaming you or anyone
else!), and that would be the descriptions. I fully expect that that may be
because I'm an artist and a writer, and I muchly prefer having a detailed
description of how something looks (just an oddity of mine :)  ). (but of
course, the author doesn't have to go on and on and on...) And speaking of
descriptions, **don't** ever read "Travels With Charley" (sp?) if you don't
like them, because the author (crap, forgot his name... Sand... something?)
is *totally* into discriptions! He goes on for -pages-. (though in some
sense, that can also be soothing)

I also DO prefer more action now as well... though if I recall correctly
(and that was many years ago, so my faulty memory may be even faultier!),
when I first read The Hobbit, I was simply enthralled, action or not. I
never in *any* of my wild dreams, thought that it would be made into a
movie, and I -certainly- never thought that computer games would be based
upon the book(s). NOW, after all these years and such complete immersion and
exposure to the games, I find I must agree with you. Hmm... I wonder if
that's a Model T vs. Ford Thunderbird kinda question ;) Not that it matters.
Ultimately, I know what you mean, having read them some 25 years ago, having
experienced EQ as well as UO, GS and DAoC... yeah... I see what you mean...
but that doesn't mean that they're not worth a read :) Glad that you're both
viewing and reading :)


Darklet, druid of *almost* 18 seasons

Thanks for playing.
