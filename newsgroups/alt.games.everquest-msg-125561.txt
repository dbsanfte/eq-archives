Thank you for the reply. I am doing some quest now. Come to find out my big
proble is getting my body back. I had two friends try to get the body. When
the first friend tried to pull the body threw the teleport beam thr body we
think went into the wall. I took a Necromancer toon with the locate corpse
spell and it points me to a wall. The other side of the wall is another
zone. I tried to /petition with the information and nobody ever got back to
me.  Some how I still think EQ is fun, maybe I have lost my mind. Thank you
for the reply.
