Considering I started a Monk for 2 reason, solo and pulling that nerf
hit like a ton of bricks. If you think it had little effect on the
folks playing Monks guess again. Drove many of us slam out of the game
even if a lot hung on for a few more months hoping for a change from
sony. No class could replace that Monk, they just werent as much fun.
When you are all alone pulling for the first time in ToV with a whole
raid hanging on your decisions that is job statifaction and the reward
for a LOT of hard work...taking that away was just flat cruel.

This crap about Monks having AC that they were "Never intended to
have" applied to maybe 1% of the Monk player base. The rest of us had
maybe 1100-1200 AC at level 60. That arguement is sheer bullshite. We
could tank maybe long enough for the group to find a real tank or
allow a cleric to camp at the high end. Most of us HATED to tank for a
group as it was just too much to do both jobs. Bah the guy that
started that AC crap was full of shit the whole time he played the
game.

Im going to forgo comment on the rest because it all revolves around
what the uninformed thought Monks were, those who lived and died with
the class know better. Yes bards could pull better after we left our
Monks and played bards, Yes SKs could pull better cause guess who was
playing the SKs. And just for clarification they did nerf Monk damage
by a serious shortage of PoP weapons drops for the class, no where
near the number or quality of drops that the plate classes were
getting. Can you say Windblade? 

Hell if for no other reason than simple justice give em back what they
lost and see what happens next....nuff said.
