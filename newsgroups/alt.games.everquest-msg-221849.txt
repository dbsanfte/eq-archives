Then I must bow before your greater mastery of the intricacies of 
Everquest :)

Hmmm, I will try that.  Well, apart from the pet part anyway.

BIG trouble.

Well, my three attempts failed.  Ah well, have wandered off the Burned 
Woods for a change of scene.  Bloody hard to see the mobs for thr trees, 
but lots of nice dark blues.  A little more exploration, avoiding the 
skeles (one of which reduced me to l43 again), might show a nice 'safe' 
area to pull to.  I think the area in front of Skyshrine may be good, 
although anyhting gaurding the entrance may not be a friend of mine.

Many thanks to everyone who has taken the time to offer help.  If anyone 
sees Messi Bugga, the loner Druid on Bristlebane, and fancies a bit of 
grouping training or just some buffs holler :)
