Did you /yell?  If not, then he did the right thing.  Do you know what
often happens to people who help people in your situation?  They often
don't get a "thank you", but rather get chewed out as kill stealers.

If you don't ask for help, the only classes that should jump in are those
that can help without risking stealing the kill.  Healers can heal you.
Many can root the mobs to give you a chance to get away.  A taunter might
even taunt the mob off you.  Mages don't have those options.
