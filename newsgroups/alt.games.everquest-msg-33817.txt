When you make the rules, you of necessity draw 2 lines.  

1. The line which must not be crossed(Only you know where this is)
2. The line which you state ought not be crossed(you tell people about
this one)

As you are drawing the lines,  you know exactly what does and does not
cross line number 1, BUT knowing human nature as you do, you know people
will stretch the line, so you must draw number 2 such that most people
stretching up against it will not push past number 1.  When someone
crosses line number 1, you smack them down,  when he stretches against
line number 2 without crossing number 1, you allow him to continue on.

That is how and why the naming convention exists.  It is line number 2. 
It specifies Restrictions which can be pushed against and played within
to allow creative freedom.  IF someone creates a name which crosses
beyond or above the limits of 2, but does not reach or pass 1,  e.g.
Stabzjoo or gandorf or Mezjoo.  They will be overlooked.  When someone
presses number 2 to breaking e.g. Gandalfthegreywizard  They will be put
back in their place.
