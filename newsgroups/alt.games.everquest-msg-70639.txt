Congrats, and my apologies for having to deal with the twits that are most
government employees. :) I just hope you have better luck with getting folks
who can actually type a coherent sentence than I did with my e-mail
correspondence to the US Consulte in Vancouver. ;) As for the reasons, I
pointed out my situation with the lack of a work visa since I didn't fit
into any of the examples you gave. ;)

That's fair enough. I wasn't so much directing that comment at you
personally, as the people who're stuffing their noses into what I've said
and trying to tell me how I should be living my life. Sorry if I offended.

Sorry also for this one. Just been a bit high-strung, what with people (not
yourself) assuming that they know how to live my life better than I do. :)
Hell, even if I won the lottery, I'd have to find *something* to do with my
time. Sitting on one's butt for longer periods of time than is neccessary
gets incredibly boring. :) Maybe I could hire Absor to be a punching bag. =)
