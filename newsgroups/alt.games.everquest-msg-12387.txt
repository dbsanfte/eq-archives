My god, that is brilliant ...

No, really. I remember ages ago, when trying to do the Militia Tunic quest,
s l o w l y building my faction with those damn things, dragging my
encumbered ranger out to WC over and over again. I could just have died!

The beggars will, of course, key in on this. Pull the old 10,000 copper
trick, and they /duel you, die, come back and drag all that cash back to the
bank. Savvy!
