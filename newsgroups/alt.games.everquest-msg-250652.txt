Pretty sure there used to be a command called /pet guard me, which is
basically the same as /pet follow me, but back in the days the pet
would attack anything hostile coming close to you. Very usefull
because the pet attack range was bigger then the aggro range of most
mobs.

/pet guard here also used to let the pet attack anything near it. Not
sure why that was nerfed a long time ago because pets were still
non-neutral and AFK camping was still possible because of that. Now
that pets are made neutral it's a mute point.

The guard here now only gives the pet a spot to return to when not
engaged in combat. Also it points to the nearest mob in range. If no
mobs are in range it will default to facing north IIRC.

Yup, follow default.
