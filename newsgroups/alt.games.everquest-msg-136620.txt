Thanks Kirk but you are wasting your time. i do not have time to eduacate
people. Although he says he has read all these books he fails to list any.
Also all those books he has read about terrorists - he must be a hell of a
speed reader. He has concluded that the books I listed are propaganda
without even checking them out - actually they are very informative - they
simply do not support his biased viewpoint ( the US is terrible) which seems
to be unencumbered by knowledge.
 I do not know where he gets his info on american blacks but I live in a
state that is 35% black.
I think I can spend my time more profitably reading.
