Back before PC's and computer games it was estimated that the average
adolesent spent about 6hrs a day watching television.  People who aren't
"gamers", prodigous readers, or work-aholics probably spend 3 to 5 hours a
day watching televison on average.. just a guess.  Wouldn't it make more
sense to be concerned about excessive television viewing that gamming?  From
what I see while serfing the channels while eating dinner (the only time I
usually watch TV) between 7:30 to 8pm it would seem that viewing as little
as one hour of  network TV a day could destroy millions of health brain
cells.  From having talked to several avant televison viewers at work I'd
have to say regular long term exposure leaves one with only several
functioning brain cells within a few years.  Give me games any day!
