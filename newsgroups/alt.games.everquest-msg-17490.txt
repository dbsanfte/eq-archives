>i have very few macros setup and was wondering about some more useful ones

    I don't know if they're USEFUL, but....

Cleric: for raids in places like ToV, where all heals are called, /shout
(Heal name) on %t! followed by /cast (Heal).

Monk, warrior: standard pulling macro. Right now, favs are "/g %t which does
not kill me, makes me stronger." and "/g Hey, %t looks like Messier! Chip?"
(Monk is in FM at the giant fort, pulling big bald things.)

Rogue has an Evade macro - /attack off, /doability (Hide), /attack on - and
a Pick Pockets macro - /attack off, /doability (PP), /attack on. Also a pull
macro - /g Grrrr. Bark. %t. Bark. Grrrr. (Three guesses where she is.)

Enchanter has a mez macro - /say Look into my eyes, %t!, /cast (Single
Mez) - and a Choke line macro - /say You have... disappointed me, %t., /cast
(Choke-line spell). Enchanter is about the only one where I think it's
important enough to announce the target to do macros for it - single mez so
they won't break it, and Choke-line so they know I can't re-mez it. I used
to have a macro for the AoE mez that was a quote from Hudson from "Aliens",
but the group usually didn't need me to tell them how many mobs were coming.
