And what happens when a mob on your "hit list" pops outside of that time?
You just let it go?

Warn the group that you might need to leave to raid?  Of course.   I never
suggested that you shouldn't.   But are you going to completely stop all
activity 5 hours before the mob your guild is targeting is scheduled to pop,
just because the random timer may cause you have to leave to raid... within
the next 10 hours?

Yes.  "the" mob.   I know of very few guilds strong enough to raid more than
one target at a time.

Gee, thanks.   So glad you straigtened that out for me.

For you perhaps.   IME, raids would start when a target was up and
available, and there were enough people willing to raid it.

A good thing then.   Instanced raids were not around when I was playing the
raid game, but unless your guild does them exclusively, you can still plan
on having your schedule disrupted every so often.

And you would post that information on your website, and give it out to
anyone who asked in tells? (as the person I was responding to suggested.)

Or are you saying again that you wouldn't do anything at all if it was
possible a mob that needed to be rushed *might* spawn?
