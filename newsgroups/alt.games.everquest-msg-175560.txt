I'm at work so I don't really have time to outline my idea of how it's going
to work, but I can tell you that this is not it.  The devs have said that
anyone can do it, and it's not a matter of getting lucky, just a matter of
figuring it out.  If it's just a random combination of skills, then there's
nothing to figure out and you're just basically playing the game and hoping
you'll hit the right combination eventually.  Also the devs have said that
powergamers will not have any significant advantage over casual gamers...
this would be an extremely significant advantage, because a powergamer could
just train various skills hour after hour after hour (especially since you
can take skill points out of one skill and use them to train something else
instead anytime you want) until they get the "You are now Force-Sensitive!"
magic message.

I think (and I've read every bit of information that the devs have mentioned
anywhere regarding the Jedi process, so this is a very educated guess) that
it will involve a random sequence of quests/missions, different for each
character, and there will be extremely cryptic clues in-game that will tell
you (if you're smart enough and can figure them out) what the next quest in
the sequence is.  I'd also imagine that they'll periodically change the set
of quests and the clues involved, so you can't simply build a database of
quests and clues and check every single quest and look for one of the
appropriate clues.  Think about it: 50 quests involved (not at all an
unreasonable number, even if they're picking a different set of 50 quests
every month or so) with a sequence of 10 of those quests for your character
to become Force-Sensitive.  That's nearly 100 quadrillion combinations.
Wanna try to farm that?

This is true in that the devs have said that if you come up against a Jedi
in 1-on-1 combat, run!  But you have to consider that (1) Jedi will be rare,
so it won't be something you have to worry about too often, (2) given the
proper weapons/vehicles you might have a chance, and (3) SWG, unlike EQ, is
not completely, or even mostly, geared towards combat.  Combatant
professions make up only a small percentage of total professions.  And
whatever you might think -- there are entire guilds of 100+ members already
in existence pending the release of SWG who are entirely composed of people
who intend to be manufacturers, dancers, miners, traders, explorers, etc.,
none of which are even slightly geared towards combat.  So I guess you could
say that no class is balanced -- except that everyone's ability to advance
in his/her chosen profession (including Jedi) is completely equal.  The
difference is that if you're a chef, for Christ's sake don't go around
fighing things (unless you have a death wish of course :) )!

Also there's the PvP system... while the system is set up to encourage
combatants to engage in PvP you won't have to fight other players unless you
want to.  To be permanently exempt from PKs, you declare yourself neutral
faction, don't duel anybody (except maybe other chefs when they burn the
food), and avoid battlefields (if you enter a battlefield you're required to
declare a faction, then you fight on the side of that faction until you die,
at which point you'll spawn outside the battlefield and will be unable to
reenter the area until the battle is over).

See above.  And the reason Jedi accounts won't be sold to any large degree
is that it's supposed to be nearly as hard to remain a Jedi as it is to
become one.  Ebayers might buy a Jedi but they'll stay Jedi for all of two
days, since they'll know absolutely nothing about playing one.  I'm not
saying accounts won't be sold, but I think Jedi accounts will lose their
Ebay value when people realize they're wasting their money unless the owner
of the account or some other person is willing to put in the weeks to
training teaching them how to properly play a Jedi without losing their Jedi
status.  And, of course, unless *they* are willing to put in the time to
learn it.  And, really, I have to problem with someone buying an account so
long as they play it like they have better than cabbage between their ears.
Making Jedi accounts difficult to play won't necessarily prevent ebaying but
it will certainly make sure that griefers won't buy them and then act like
5-year-olds with a rattle.

Hmm... yes, and apparently (I don't know this for sure but I'm guessing from
the information provided by devs) a properly equipped bounty hunter has a
chance to kill a Jedi.  Not an overwhelming chance, but a chance.
