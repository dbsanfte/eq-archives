Does it need a reason?

Since we can assume you will answer "Yes" from your other statements:
why does it need a reason?

Now you're playing semantic games. By that argument "God" is
responsible for everything because you just defined the laws of the
universe as "God". There's no value to that argument, it leads
nowhere.

Except you extended it to include things that can be (and are)
measured. The universe did not start in the "pre-history of time".

A reason? The universe does not require a reason to be. This is a
common faulty argument from the "intelligent design" creationist camp.

And once again remember to avoid the trap of trying to use newtonian
"time" frame of reference. It's not valid.

That is an illogical argument. You are arguing against something
because it doesn't fit your idea of tidiness or some other *emotional*
requirement. It could even be a snakey tendril of "fear of death",
after all no one wants to think they just melt into nothingness
forever when they die.

Most scientists don't tell people who believe in unprovable and
non-interactive theories that they are "wrong", just "meaningless".

If a theory can't be observed in action in any way, and has no effect
on the universe in any way, its quite pointless, isn't it? Most
religions fall into this category when they try to explain reality.

Actually it can, and there is strong support for an ordered system
emerging spontaneously.

And you also are arguing for "any reason", not just "some reason".

It does, however, do a pretty good job, and gets pretty close. Loose
ends do not invalidate the theory, and do not invite comparisons to
theories with no evidence or ludicrous evidence, such as religion.

Newton thought he had the universe down too. He was ultimately proven
wrong in some respects, but for the most part his theories were
correct. You would have us thinking about Gods and Deitic Creators the
minute we notice that Newton's formulas stop working properly at
relativistic levels.

The uncertainty principle is more of a mathematical shortcut than
anything else; it allows you to assume electrons (etc) can shift from
state to state according to how you need to use them in whichever
field.

However its not relevent to the universe whether we "know" or "don't
know".

The idea that matter can spring into existance spontaneously does
actually have part of its basis in the uncertainty principle, so
you're on the right track in a way - however you're still in Newtonian
mode if you are trying to use it as a basis for the Big Bang. Those
particles come into being in the universe; the Big Bang deals with the
creation of the universe itself.


>>The sun coming up every day was once a miracle.
>
>And by definition it was... inexplicable by science.

No, inexplicable by those who tried to interpret it. However, despite
their lack of knowledge, it did have a scientific and observable
basis. They just lacked the tools to gather and interpret the
information necessary. And this is true of pretty much every single
scientific element. Once the tools become available, its no longer a
miracle, and the religious elements, or those dependent on emotion or
faith, invariably fall away.

Well they aren't. No theory that is not observable, can't correctly or
reliably predict cause/effect, and has no measurable effect on the
universe, is worthy of consideration. The only redeeming value they
would have is to show why they are of no use, to people who don't know
any better.

Equivocation fallacy, then.

Actually by definition you are being irrational for being open to the
possibility, because you have no reason to think so, other than
emotional considerations.
