I've played a human monk to 51 and an iksar to 30 and i'll say one thing -
an untwinked monk (fists and no haste) will find it almost impossible to
kill an exp-giving mob after about lvl 20.  With a nice set of gear though,
a monk can solo fairly well.  Remember, they get a free 25% heal every 6
minutes, which isn't as long as it sounds.  Bind to 50, mend, and you're at
75% health.  At level 51, you can bind to 70% and mend which takes you to
95% health.  Honestly, I think bards are the best solo class and I think the
only reason you don't hear that more often is that there are so few bards.
They can fear/charm/chant(dd) kite, and have zero downtime.
