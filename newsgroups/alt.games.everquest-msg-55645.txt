I am running Win2k right now and the sound is so horrible (no soundeffects
of anything 3 feet away from me, anything I cast gets a very loud sound,
music stutters all the time) I've turned it off completely and am playing
music cd's now. I do have a SB Live, but it being the industry standard for
a couple of years now I kind of assumed VI would have fixed issues with it
in one of the monthly patches. Of course they blame it on us for having
non-standard equipment (uh-huh).

Also after install, make sure you have all sticky key functions, timed
events and other nasty pop-up things turned off. After every reinstall I
always forget at least one (Sticky keys is a pain, doesn't want to be turned
off at times) and they always pop-up just after you pull or are running
towards a zone.

Most issues would be solved easily if you could just alt-tab back in EQ, but
noooo. Anti-hackers is more important then having the normal players have a
decent game. Heck it's not even anti-hack because any decent hacker just
sets up a second computer and tracks everything with that one. Or even have
a second Videocard in the same box which produces the desktop with a bit of
tweaking.

Kilmir, pissed over 4 eq-lockups, 5 "normal" linkdeaths, ping of 300-2000,
packet loss of 20%-60% and 1 time a sticky-key pop-up over the course of 1
weekend.
