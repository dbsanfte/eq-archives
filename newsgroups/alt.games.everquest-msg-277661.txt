Your in our world now! has always been an apt slogan for everquest, its 
only fitting that everquest 2 be a brave new world.

    Patiently the D.H.C. explained. If the children were made to scream 
at the sight of a rose, that was on grounds of high economic policy. Not 
so very long ago (a century or thereabouts), Gammas, Deltas, even 
Epsilons, had been conditioned to like flowers=3Fflowers in particular and 
wild nature in general. The idea was to make them want to be going out 
into the country at every available opportunity, and so compel them to 
consume transport.

    "And didn't they consume transport?" asked the student.

    "Quite a lot," the D.H.C. replied. "But nothing else."

    Primroses and landscapes, he pointed out, have one grave defect: 
they are gratuitous. A love of nature keeps no factories busy. It was 
decided to abolish the love of nature, at any rate among the lower 
classes; to abolish the love of nature, but not the tendency to consume 
transport. For of course it was essential that they should keep on going 
to the country, even though they hated it. The problem was to find an 
economically sounder reason for consuming transport than a mere 
affection for primroses and landscapes. It was duly found.

    "We condition the masses to hate the country," concluded the 
Director. "But simultaneously we condition them to love all country 
sports. At the same time, we see to it that all country sports shall 
entail the use of elaborate apparatus. So that they consume manufactured 
articles as well as transport. Hence those electric shocks."
