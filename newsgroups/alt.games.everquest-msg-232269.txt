To kinda respond to both responses, since the server had crashed, Im
assuming that this second GM was just in a real hurry and wasnt
thinking (maybe Im assuming too much). I kind of did tell the thrid GM
we talked to about this problem, but got the 'ol /bug response and she
quickly vamoosed to go rez others on the server (i guess).

We went back to SG last night - and even succord over ourselves and
didnt have a problem. So I dont know what to think. If it had just
been one group training us over and over, I wouldnt have thought it
odd, but at my recollection, at least 3 different groups trained us in
this way, at least one (probably more) were on their way to TOV. So I
thought maybe the Mistress was still on her way back to her "throne"
when the other groups were succing across, but there was a substantial
amount of time between trains - so Im baffled.
