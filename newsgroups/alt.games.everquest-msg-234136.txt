Thanks for the answer, however, it brings another question to mind.  It
sounds like each wing takes you to the court yard. Then with the key you
click on the structure that ports you to the "appropriate" tower. So it
appears to be 4 different towers.  If that's the case, when the first tower
you try with the key puts the key on your keyring, do you have to do this
procedure on each of the wings to go to each of the towers, or does the key
(now on the keyring) work all the towers?

Thanks again for all the great info
