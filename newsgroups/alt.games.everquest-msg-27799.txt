You've got Res.  You've got a virtual monopoly on Res.  This makes up
for a whole hell of a lot.  

Plus, CH pretty much rules the endgame.  It's to the point that
Clerics are the *only* viable healers in most post 50 dungeons.  And
there's no way you're going to be able to hunt down there without a
res'er in the first place.  You have *any* idea how much time you
loose in a post-50 death?  A single res can literally mean months of
tedious exp grinding.

Whine, whine whine...

It's not that clerics aren't *good* healers pre-50, it's just that the
shaman is a *better* healer.  This does not mean that the Cleric isn't
a good healer in most groups.  Hell, pre-50, druids make perfectly
acceptable healers, if you know what you're doing, Rangers, Pallys and
Bards offer decent enough healing as well.  It's just that such major
amounts of healing that the cleric specializes in are not really
needed until the upper level content.

But Res alone will get you a slot into many a group.  Plus, remember
that 90% of the players out there are conviced that Clerics are the
end all healers in every group, every level.  In other words, you can
take advantage of thier stupidity.

I've *never* seen a good cleric have to hunt long for pickup groups.
If you know what the fuck you're doing, you'll make a name for
yourself.

Oh, Jesus, Wizard is another can of worms entirely.  It's another
class that really isn't all that great until they hit the endgame
content.  Hopefully, the Familiar line will fix a few things in SoL, I
personally woudln't touch one until then.  Make a Mage, you'll be
much, much happier in the end.
