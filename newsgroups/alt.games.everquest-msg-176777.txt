Hi there!

I am looking to get some Fine Heraldic Armor for my HEF WAR and don't have
the big-bucks to shell out so I am gathering the components and am hoping to
contract a Human Smith to do the combine for me.

The receipe for Fine Heraldic Armor is:
1. Appropriate plate mold
2. Infused Rings
3. Enchanted chain jointing
4. Royal Temper
5. Leather Padding
6. Smithy Hammer

I understand the Human Smith *must* do the final combine (item 1-6 in
cultural forge), but is the human smith required to make the items that are
used for this combine (items 2-5), or can I have some friends help me with
those steps?

TIA,
