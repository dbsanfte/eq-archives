While I tend to agree top posting is not the preferable to responses 
immediately following a given point, I hardly find it impolite, and I 
hardly find it necessary to be "fixed."

OTOH, I don't find it necessary to bitch about them being "fixed" 
either.

On, still, yet ANOTHER hand, (how many do I have?  wanna find out?) I find 
it even more boorish (and even snotty) to "fix" a top post, and then 
comment on the fact that you "fixed" it.

So... who's the worst offender in the whole mess?

Quite plainly, *I* am.  For continuing the whole stupid argument even 
further when there wasn't even an argument ocurring.

Thank you, and good night.
