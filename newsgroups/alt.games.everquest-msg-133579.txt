I am an iskar monk trying to get my new shackle.  I need to talk to The
Great Ompwomp, but his little ogre standing behind him hates me.  I am feign
deathed my way up to summoning the dancing skeleton, but he refuses to give
me the hand.  Is this quest broken?  I have died 5 times now trying to get
this to work.  I am playing on the FV server, so just leveling until the
ogres are green to me does not work out because of other quests I am trying
to do.  Any help would be greatly appreaciated.  Thanks!
