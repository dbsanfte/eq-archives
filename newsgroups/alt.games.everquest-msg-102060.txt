Okay all,
I have been trying to run eqw with 2 separeate accounts for a month now. I
had all kinds of problems with lag and being like I was in a bad 4th grade
slideshow, needless to say this wasnt real conducive to PL'ing my Vah-Shir
warrior. I upgraded my video card from a 32meg Ge-force 2 to a Hercules
Guillemont 64meg 3d prophet 4500, (deciding on this card because it
outperforms other cards in quake the OTHER online game). I installed my new
vid-card and fired up both accounts at the sime time and STILL had the same
damned problem. I was extremely pissed at this point after wasting the money
to buy the new vid card. So I did what we all do when all else fails RTFW
(refer to the farking website) and on eqw's website it said they no longer
read there email "oh just great" I think, and keep reading, well they had a
link to the message board and I went and scoped it out. Thank god they had a
post on there about the 5.1 Sound Card. I have a Sound Blaster Audigy
Platinum sound card so I read on, ANYWAY the point of this whole long post
is if your having the slide-show problem TURN YOUR HARDWARE ACCELERATION ALL
THE WAY OFF! I did that and now everything works wonders and I can PL my
other characters to my hearts content.
