Someone mentioned the crushbone belts...I'm sure you've seen them, as they
now fall off of orcs on orc hill.  You can sell them for lots of money, or
you can hit level 8 and 9 that much faster...your choice.

But for soloing, like everyone else said, GFay is full of weird and
dangerous people (not all, but enough to make most people dislike the zone,
though I love it).  Head over to Butcherblock.  Get a bind (if you can) from
someone at the GFay/BB zone line (tip: get bound near the mouth of the zone,
not right at the line...when you return to your bind point it's way too easy
to run the wrong way and accidentally zone :p ).
