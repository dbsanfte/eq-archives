Ok I am a lvl 24 necro who is a bit confused on the research.  I think there
were about 3 spells that needed to be researched by my level and I hear
people say that you should have your research at 50 or so at my lvl to
almost guarantee success.  How do you people get the research up so high on
just 3 spells???  I tried to train past my lvl 16 mark but it says I have
already trained in research.  Do I just have to keep making the same spells
over and over again to get my lvl up???  Someone please give me some
insight.  Thanks
