Er, words can have more than one meaning you know. And where does religion 
come into it? 'Merkin' can mean either a pubic wig or indeed a whole 
artificial vagina, not just the hair. The word was originally a term for 
the female genitals themselves, but that meaning has fallen out of usage. 
To quote from one of the above sites:

...The word actually has a number of senses, all of them sexually-related 
and, therefore, highly risible to persons of a certain cast of mind. One of 
the current standard ones is pubic wig (such wigs are used, apparently, in 
the theatrical and film worlds as modesty devices in nude scenes). It can 
also be a contrivance used by male cross-dressers to imitate the female 
genitals. Another sense which is even lower slang and which came into the 
language last century is, as Eric Partridge delicately puts it in A 
Dictionary of Historical Slang, "an artificial vagina for lonely men".
