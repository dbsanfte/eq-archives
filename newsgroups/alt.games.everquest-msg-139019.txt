Hm... English is basically "German for Dummies", and I found it piss-
easy to learn (although admittedly I still mangle the grammar and 
spelling with regularity, especially when I'm tired). In fact, I was so 
cocky with my "facility" for languages that when I moved to Berlin, I 
fully expected to learn German in a few months. Boy, did I ever get a 
reality check there. :/

Spoken English takes a bit of getting used to, especially if your native 
language spells phonetically, like Spanish or German; but on the other 
hand, the whole of English grammar probably fits on the back of a small 
envelope, and after that, it's all down to building a good vocabulary, 
which is easy, because media in English is so pervasive.

Apocryphal story... Two Korean businessmen get in a taxi at New York's 
JFK airport, and start speaking to each other in Korean. The taxi driver 
turns around and tells them "Hey, guys, you are in America now, so speak 
Spanish!".
