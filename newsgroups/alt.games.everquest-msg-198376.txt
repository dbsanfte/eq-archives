    I don't think I've ever seen another cleric get far enough away that one
couldn't /assist off him. Even with creep from bad positioning/push, the
other clerics should stay in range. The mob and the MT might go out of /ass
range, but not the other clerics. Not unless you have an extreme example
like Blinky the Wonder Bird in PoFire where being moved is part of the
encounter.

    Thanks. I forget my tags from time to time. :-)

    Timing on EthElix isn't tough, though. As long as yours lands shortly
after the last one goes poof, your butt is covered. Watch the primary's
screen for when it fades, then reach over and hit the "AoEEE" hotkey on the
second box.

> In my guild, any cleric dropping MGB EE is not in the rotation

    In mine, they could be. Depends on who has up MGB at the time. If
someone is in the rotation, they just tell the others "skip me next heal"
and pass one round while the others and/or the cover CH cover for them.

    For all the complaining I've done here, we don't allow second boxes to
CH rot, ever. We don't use pauses, though, so that pretty much rules them
out as being viable. In the other elemental guilds on the server, second box
clerics are a growing trend and in many cases officers have changed classes
to clerics just to keep their raids running.

    Really? I assume you mean that there's 1.8 secs between CH's, or that
the chain is at least six clerics long, when you say that. And that
surprises me because I can't think of a mob that we used a full six cleric
chain on recently. Not even Xegony, and that's a CH rotation marathon fight.

    Nor mine. But when you want to raid, do you look and say "Do we have the
best clerics we can online", or do you say "Do we have just enough healing
power to get by online"? And when you recruit, do you recruit people because
you can, or because you've noticed that you've been short on that class
recently? Finally, if you do bother recruiting a cleric, do you try and see
if they're highly capable, or do you just test to see that they're as good
as the other second boxes which are already considered adequate for the job?

    My guild ran into that problem during the trials. There started to be
whispers that certain guild clerics could not get people through the trials,
and one moron went so far as to post about how the guild needed more skilled
people and not "what we have now". Instead of inviting guild clerics to
trials or XP groups, people would work to flag their second boxes. That
makes a bad situation - lack of guild XP spots for clerics - even worse.
