	People have been playing this game for over three years now.  Reams and
reams of data have been collected, parsed and scrutinized over all that time,
and the players have collected a fair amount of information about The Way
Things Work.  We know, from experience, that stats have very little effect on
the game and generally don't provide any effect except when you pass certain
breakpoints.  And the only people who arbitrarily assign haste values are
hucksters in your server's trading zone, who will claim every newly-discovered
haste item has "FBSS haste!" even if it came from a level 20 mob.

	Actually, it's just like a philosopher to tell you that you're making a
mistake and why.

	If you want to go out and try to maximize DEX and AGI at the expense of
more useful numbers then I can't stop you, but I can break it down for you:
it's not going to work.  You'll be buried alongside the rest of the prom
queens.
