This is one of the most common ways to work on weapon skills.  I'm
sure you'll be able to find groups that'll allow this.

There ain't that much damage in all of Norrath (remember that you
must be swinging at blue-con mobs to have a reasonable chance of
skill-ups).

When starting with very low skill, you want to be fighting the lowest
dark-blue mobs you can find.  Also, it helps to seek out DEX buffs
and/or items (not a huge help, but a noticeable one if you compare
large enough samples).  Once your skill is around half your level cap
you might want to seek higher blue-cons as the chance of a skill-up
appears to scale somewhat with the relative level of your target.
Don't expect much from yellow/red cons, especially when skill is low,
because you have to score a hit to have a chance at a skill-up.

Also, once your skill is decent, say 2/3 of your level cap, it's not
unreasonable to group using the weapon.  You won't be quite as strong
as a character with maxed skills, but not everybody is at/near max
and so long as you play your character well you will be effective in
a group.  A Warrior's main job is to tank, so you need enough skill

to hit the mob frequently and thereby hold its attention.  When you
are not MT is best time to work on 2h weapons, unless you have a
2hander that outdamages your dual wield combo by a _lot_.
