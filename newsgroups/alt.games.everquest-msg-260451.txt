Hmmm, I need to test this out. I could have sworn DoTs of the same
series will not stack if you are casting them. Like the earlier
example that is a poison-based DoT. Casting a lower level version will
not take effect if the higher -level is already on the mob. Casting a
higher level pone will over-ride the lower if its already on the mob.
It doesn't make any sense if they do stack. That means a shaman can
potentially stack 6 or so posion based DoTs all at the same time. I
don't think this happens.
