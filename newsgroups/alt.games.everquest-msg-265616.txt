Charisma, for a warrior, is limited (AFAIK) to your buy/sell price from 
vendors.  A simple solution to this is a pair of Opal Encrusted Steins, 
which is good for +50 charisma; if thats not enough, there are other 
cheap pieces which will raise cha a bit more.

For less than 100 pp you can probably get more than +75 Cha in gear.

The highest charisma that will matter if your vendor is at least 
indifferent to you is 106, so there isn't a race out there which can't 
get as high as it matters with this kind of boost (and possibly taking 
off neg cha gear; my cleric's charisma is admittedly around 6 when raid 
geared)

Resists, while of marginal utility, would be more useful for a warrior 
than a cha boost.

Regen is one of those things that matters only in aggregate; my 
berserker currently runs around regenning 45 hp a tic self buffed, which 
is sufficient to take on most dark blue con mobs with no healer at all. 
    I wish I'd picked a troll or iksar instead of a barbarian, and that 
I'd invested in leadership AA for regen, because the bigger boost would 
let me get away with that even longer.

Of course eventually even this wouldnt' matter, as you point out, 
there's a point at which damage incoming is higher than even the topped 
out regen will matter for.  But leadership AA are available from a very 
low level, and regen helps a -lot- in the low to mid level of the game.

I feel this way about Delegate MA as well, but perhaps its because I 
have a strong tendancy to target mobs by clicking on them.  Sure, I know 
about /assist and have hotkeys for it, but I've played so many classes 
which have had stun duty or CC duty in one form or another that I'm used 
to worrying about the "other" mobs.  Delegate MA helps a lot there, 
because I know which mob -doesn't- need CC'd, just as handy as knowing 
which mob does need to be beat upon.
