Amen.  I've disbanded bards who've insisted they could only play one song
during a fight.  Even if I have a difference preference to *which* songs are
played, that's my problem (for the most part), but not playing 3 songs is
negligent.

On a 56k connection, I could do 3 with little problem.  That'd be like me
claiming I couldn't backstab while doing normal melee... it's just part of
the job.
