Hollows C (Murkglider caves) is the one you want for rune farming 
(though named spawn rate has been nerfed).  Bats and rats are nonkos 
(though social), and all the murkgliders can be bypassed with invis to 
undead.  All you have to do is IVU up, proceed to first named spot, kill 
PH (horrifying rat?), IVU up, go to second named spot (15-20 seconds 
away), kill tatterwing bat, then cycle between the two spots and kill 
off PH/named.
