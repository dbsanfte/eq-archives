This is precisely the point I'm making.

The arguement I keep seeing is "people who want /raid should get PoP, yes its a
marketing ploy but this is capitalism, get over it".  Sounds good, until you
realize that this particular function is not even useful to people who DID buy
PoP, except in rare circumstances.

Then you look at the fact that as initially implemented it WAS useful to
everyone, until they nerfed it.  It didn't work all that well, needed some
fixing... but you could invite non PoP people into your raid, so until LD or
something struck, you could see it working.

Then you go on a real /raid enabled raid in a PoP zone, and you see how very
nice this is.  But over most of the world, most people are going on raids with
people in them who aren't on PoP yet... and so its useless.
