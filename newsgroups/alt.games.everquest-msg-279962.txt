What are you smoking?  I thought Vlad the Inhaler's comments were
misleading, and you've got him beat with the opposite extreme.  There are a
*few* (very few) backflag quests that are obviously intended to open up
zones to non-raiders (the one for access to Sol Ro Tower comes to mind) by
providing a single group accessible entrance path.
 
You're not getting Time flagged with "some high level friends" unless your
definition of "some" is somewhere north of 30 people.  You're not getting
flagged for the elemental planes through the backflagging option without
somewhere north of 30 to 50 people (at least).  Those number requirements
are pretty constant across the whole back-flagging spectrum.  You need 18
people in a raid simply to start the instanced expeditions for a lot of the
backflagging options, with no consideration given to whether you can
actually accomplish it with only 18 people.  They are obviously intended to
give guilds a less taxing method of getting new members "up to speed".  In
that, I think they do a pretty good job.
