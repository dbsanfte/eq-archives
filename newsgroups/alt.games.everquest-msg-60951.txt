At 26 i am lucky to even get a group/partner i was lucky on my first
time in GD, got invited to join a 34 druid for the tizmaks, here regen
and sow where great to have, i could use allure without loosing hp if
i was sitting, she could pull with harmony/snare and that worked well.

When soloing i had to find wandering ones that took some time and i
died more than once, still i loved it ever fight was a close call so i
had to stay sharp, shure that won't help when i go LD after pulling a
yellow :(
