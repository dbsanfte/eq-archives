This is where we'll have to agree to disagree, barring some employee from
Sony posting some actual statistics.  I think, particularly for someone
timezone challenged, you may not realize how much of the population raids. 
There are a *lot* of raiders that log in for the raid, go straight from
guildhall to the raid zone, which is often instanced thus exacerbating the
"problem", and then log off right after the raid.  Hell, that describes me a
lot of the time.

I have recently been asked by a "casual" monk to whom I gave instruction
long ago if I ever played anymore.  I raid 5 days a week for ~5 hours a day,
so even on the weeks where I *only* log in for raids I'm still online for
25+ hours.  But I'm not "visible".

I did.  The raiders did.  The knocks, and the solution to your complaints,
was called WoW (CoH, EQ2, etc.), i.e., time-challenged-friendly games that
have come out to cater to *your* playstyle, and the people who were most
frustrated with the style of EQ all left.

Eh...  arguable.  I am *intense* about progression.  But I will admit that a
certain type of drama is perpetrated almost entirely by a certain type of
player.

From a business standpoint, it's a good decision.  But trust me, the raiders
feel your pain.  We all bought LoY...

I think EQ has a looooooong future, and a secure niche, as a raid-centric
game among the plethora of more "casual" games that have come out trying to
usurp it's crown based on exactly your attitude/opinions.  I don't want them
to turn EQ into WoW (which if you have never tried, you probably should just
based on your comments here).  I enjoyed WoW.  Very well designed game. 
Just not designed for *me*.  EQ, from day one, was made for *me*.
