OK, this is driving me sane (!!) so I'm breaking down and asking
here....

Somewhere in Shar Vahl is a cat who can brew a special tea.  I know this
because I once was looking for him for something else and the NPC I
asked to help me find him told me so.  When I did find him for what I
was looking for I also spoke to him about this brew.  Now, 482999 hours
/played later I find someone asking me to fetch him one of these brewed
concoctions and after another few hours wandering around asking all
sorts of cats, including the one I'm pretty sure was the right guy, all
sorts of questions the deafening silence of non response along with the
funny looks from other players as I continually badger NPCs about teas
is pushing me to the edge of the abyss.  If anyone has been down this
road and would be willing to share the proper key phrase, maybe even the
NPC's name (though I'm pretty sure I know who he is) I've a char who
would be most grateful!
