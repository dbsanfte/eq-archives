Well i have zero knowledge of the end parts of the sewers... I don't think i
ever went deeper than 20 or so mins clearing into the zone (name farming for
spells)

But the incredibly tough boss 1, incredibly weak boss 2 isnt new to me...
Ikkinz (after kod'taz) had a simialr deal (been revamped and gimped since)
where trial 1 was almost impossible, and trial 2-3 could be beaten on the
first try/day.

Have never done a tipt or vxed that used a charmed mob, either for clearing
or killing the named.
Every tipt I did was with a warrior/paladin MA, and monk/SK as ramp tank

Aside from the pain in the ass factor of having to flag a guild.. i haven't
met too many people who didn't enjoy the tipt design/content
