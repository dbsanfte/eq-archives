What class are you?  If you can get a pet and go to  the top of the ramp.
Command the pet to /pet sit down.   The pet will turn to face the closest
Mob, which will be the trigger.  Run straight out in the direction the pet
is facing anf you shold trigger.  It'll either be Death Squad or the Dwarf.
If death squad KEEP RUNNING (sowed).  zone, come back, repeat until dwarf
pops.

I've done it twice like this
