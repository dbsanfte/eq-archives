Basic brewing for newbies:  Bog Juice.  Take one snake skin, one empty
bottle, and one (non-summoned) flask of water, and combine in a brew barrel.
You can easily get your brewing skill up to 20 this way without ever leaving
Qeynos.

I think the next items are Short Beer, Short Ale, and fish wine.  Get the
supplies for those in South Qeynos... the beer and ale ingredients are at
Voleen's Bakery (and you can brew them next door in the back room of Fish's
Ale.)  The ingredients for Fish Wine are at The Mermaid's Lure (merchant is
Captain Rohand, next to the docks).

Find the recipies at EQTraders.com.
