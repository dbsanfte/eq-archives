Beastlords were introduced with the Shadows of Luclin expansion. If
you're able to create a Vah'shir character, you have the expansion,
and, thus, you can create a Beastlord. Races that can be Beastlords
are Ogres, trolls, Barbarians, and Vah'shir. They are a very strong
class, IMO. My highest level character before I left EQ was a 57 BST.
Only 57 because I'm an altoholic and I roleplay a lot. A -LOT-. I made
that BST when SoL was released. ;)
