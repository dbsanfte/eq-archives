Should be automagic, but you do need to supply a string to put in the 
Article ID header.  If you go into the setup dialog, on the Identities tab, 
there's a box for ID Token.  Put something unique in there.  From then on, 
it'll score stuff with that token in the reference headers (i.e. stuff 
following you up) at 9999 automatically.

Note that there are a few news services that override your client-supplied 
article ID.  If your token isn't preserved, it won't catch followups.  
Check your own posts to make sure your token's going into the header.
