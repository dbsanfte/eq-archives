Never said I expected anyone to spend all their time rezzing people
for free. People seem to be reading too much into my words here. My
problem isn't that people don't give free rezzes to everyone they come
across. My problem is some people refuse to even _consider_ giving a
rez to someone in need who cannot honestly afford the fee. My problem
is also the absurdly steep fee that is the "standard" for probably 5
minutes worth of mana to med back, tops.
