It'd sure be nice if they did indeed hold up this change.  Now, on Test,
instead of using a third-party product that allows you to two-box on one
machine with EQ set up the way you want it, they've killed that (EQw
doesn't work properly, keyboard is ignored) and replaced it with crap
that (1) changes your EQ screensize to some arbitrary setting (800x600 I
think it was) screwing up your UI layout in the process, (2) dies if you
start a second copy of EQ (already running instance poofs) so that you
cannot two-box on a single machine, (3) uses your desktop resolution
instead of your selected EQ resolution when you switch it back to full-
screen mode, and (4) is buggy as all hell (had to log twice to clear
something screwy with the keyboard).

If you were someone who had recently opened a second account, but cannot
afford a second machine, you might well be pushed into cancelling both
accounts over this sort of bullshit.  Of course, if you weren't overly
impulsive you might grit your teeth and give SOE some time to either
abort this project or make it work as well as the existing product it
wrecks.

Well, you know the poor Bards are sooooooo broken, they need to buff
them up some.  :-p
