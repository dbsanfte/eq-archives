I use a netgear RT314, out of the box, no changes in configuration, works
flawlessly for EQ.  I have two, sometimes three, computers connected to it.
I only use EQ on one of the systems, my wife plays other games on hers at
the same time.  The only problems I have had have all been with my ISP, not
the router.  Basically, I plugged it in, set it somewhere out of the way,
and forgot about it.  I use Win2k on both of the computers that are always
connected to it.  It was selling for the same price as the Linksys, and
after having reviewed peoples' postings regarding various routers, and
issues they have had, I chose the Netgear, as many more people had problems
with Linksys routers, and getting them setup properly.
