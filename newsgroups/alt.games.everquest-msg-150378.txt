It depends on various factors, my mood being one
of the more important.

It is more awkward fighting on a horse (although that
part is easy to adjust to with practice), and a *lot* more
awkward chasing runners.  But it has its advantages.

First, of course, I look good. :-)  A Knight should
really have a steed.

Second, when someone else is the puller and it's an
outdoor zone, the boost in my meditation time really
makes a difference (every moment I'm not fighting or
covering ground, I'm meditating, and that adds up
more than you'd think).

And sometimes I'll find myself wanting to swap out spells
in the middle of a fight, which is possible on a horse
and impossible without one.

Finally, when I'm really desperate for mana, it's
worth the work of manually toggling my autofight on
and off every swing (thank Brell for long-delay weapons).
That way I'm meditating at about 90+% efficiency even
*during* the fight.  But it's tedious.

This is all with a "temp" storebought horse.  Once I
finally earn my AA horse, I'll have the advantages of
instant-click summoning of the horse (which means that
I can pop the horse up in the middle of a fight if I
wish, making it less necessary to have it "always up"),
and it'll be *FAST* so I'll have the added bonus of
being able to use it as an escape route.  My current
storebought horse is so slow that I *dismount* the
horse to cover ground faster (My AA-Run3 is faster
than the horse).
