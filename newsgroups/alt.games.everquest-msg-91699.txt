Pre-luclin and pre-nToV-changes, it had a couple of mobs that were
counted in the '*top* mobs'. Aary, Zlex, Vyemm, Vulak, and even some of
those were borderline 'difficult' once you work out decent tactics.
Vulak was the only one who dropped guaranteed upgrade loot. The recent
changes have made it not worth the effort to many guilds (including us)
Dain and Yeli and Tormax drop 100% guarenteed major upgrades, as well as
a few minor ones. Statue/Vind drop some nice stuff. Tunare drops a damn
nice pile of stuff, as does AoW.

Then there's Luclin:
Rhags, Creator, Arch Lich, Glyphed/Exiled/Cursed cycle, and the Emporer
in Ssra, Ring of Fire and High Priest in Acrylia, THO and Burrower in
Deep, Lord Seru etc.

All are tougher than something like Koi or Cek

Ssra has much better loot than nToV, and more mobs dropping better loot.

A full clearance of nToV nets THREE of the best items in the game if
you're lucky. Most everything else has better options. The good thing
about nToV was the sheer amount of small upgrades you could get over
Kael quest armour.
