Ok, this one is on topic, hehe.

Yes, this combo works.  I have two accounts, the mains on each account are a
53 shaman and a 47 enchanter.  I duo with them, and it's actually quite
nice.  Don't forget that at 47 an enchanter does about 530 with his DD.  The
shaman does 1200 with each of his dots.  I think of it in this way.  Let the
shaman solo, and the enchanter speed things up. a lot.  The shamans main
draw back (from what I have found) is he is, for the most part, always out
of mana.  Shamans are very good soloers, but when they run outta mana, it's
can can can.  Regrowth helps.. but with an enchanter.. shaman has clarity,
insight, gift of magic and intellectual superiority on.  I do as follows.

Shaman:
Summons pet.
HoS pet
Regrowth Pet.

Chanter:
Mind buffs shaman and self.
hastes dog dog (please don't start a thread =0P )

Shaman pulls with slow, as shaman is casting, chanter roots.  shaman
poisons, then diseases, if root breaks, he gets hit, dog dog goes in.  if
not, he sends dog dog in after second dot (so when root breaks shaman takes
some damage and not dog dog, although the pet can kick some serious ass..
(side note: with HoS and regrowth on pet (summoned at 53, light blue all the
time for me) he can tank an ice giant the entire time my shaman is sitting
down, as long as the ice giant is slowed.. thats the key).  Anyways.  mob
gets down half (shaman sitting down yawning at this point at like 80 percent
mana), chanters decides to stand up and feel worth while and nukes it for
500 damage.  mobs dead, both are at almost full mana.

Ok, well, that was long, I apologize, but it works nicely.
