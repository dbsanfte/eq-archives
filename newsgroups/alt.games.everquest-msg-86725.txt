    Depends. More important is how much no-drop stuff can the cash that an
uber player has purchase. On my server I see MQ's of Skyshrine armour
offered to help the peridot funds of the dragon-aligned guilds all the time.
Mostly silks and leathers, the odd plate piece. That would get you going
pretty damn fast. And if you were, say, the ONLY person on a newer server
that had a Manastone, how much do you suppose some people (key word: some)
would pay to get that thing? The Safehouse had in one Legends thread a list
of some of the things that were droppable and no longer dropped. It was an
interesting list.

    You can do this without having help at the other end. :-)
