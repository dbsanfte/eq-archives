There were a couple of exceptions in Velious, I know of at least one 
shaman spell that was not ancient, but was nodrop, and required you to go 
to Sleepers Tomb to get it.  Mind you, the spell is obsolete now with 
PoP.

Agreed.  In the few times I have actually managed to get a group in RSS, 
I have seen exactly one glowing rune drop, and I lost the roll.  The two 
Glowing runes I have recieved I got during guild raids.  All of the 
Greater runes I have recieved during guild raids, with the exception of 
one that I won in MPG.

It is a serious PITA to get the glowing runes particularly, if you are 
not in a raiding guild, and even if you are, the drop rate is so low that 
it will take a huge amount of time to get all the runes needed by the 
guild.
