I love Best Buy.  I never, ever, ever ask for help there.  I wish they had
more cashiers and I wish they didn't keep asking for my phone number (which
I never give), but they have the cheapest prices on a lot of stuff I buy.

Any business model that lets you return software is doomed.  A friend and I
used to exploit Babbages' return policy.  He would buy a title I wanted and
return it.  They would put it on the used shelf at a 30%-50% discount then
next day and then I'd buy it.  Eventually that location went out of
business.  We told the employees what we were doing and that their policy
was flawed.  They said there was nothing they could do about it.
