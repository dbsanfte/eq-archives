I didn't care for the interface, or the look and feel of the game.  I
cannot return it, and I have only spent 30 minutes on it.  I've slated
my account for cancellation, and would like to find some way to recoup
some of my investment.  If anyone here wants to give as a gift, or buy
it off of me, I'd be happy to part with it for $10.00 (Plus shipping)

Otherwise, I'd hate the fact that I spent $40.00 for a online trilogy
of EQ just to have it blow up in my face.  I'm very unhappy with it. 
I can understand how some might like it, but it just isn't for me. 
Anyone who might want to buy it, please let me know.

Thanks to all who'd consider.

DJM
