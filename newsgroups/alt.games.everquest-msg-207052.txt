1/3 weight reduction = haste, last time I heard.

Novel. I'd not come across that before, thanks.

Hmm, Actually, I think ATK effects your mean damage (i.e. it raises the
average damage done per shot.) Buffs like hawk eye, eagle eye, falcon eye
affect accuracy.

I believe this is only true if the ranger has higher ATK, is using innate
proc buffs or nuking. Purely based on the same weapons, the same haste
and the same weapon skills damage dealt should be the same.

Of course, rangers get self ATK buffs and so forth, so once the spells of
the ranger start coming into play they start dealing more damage.

It will happen all the time provided you have a tank who can hold aggro. A
non rooted non moving mob is one that someone is taunting and hitting.

Bowshots do not break root. Bow procs can, just like any other spell, if you
have a proccing bow.

Useful tip; the severity of this varies from expansion to expansion and zone to
zone. Outdoor POP zones are astonishingly forgiving of archery, for example.

Until the mid 40's warriors and rangers are pretty close for defense
skills, but if you're twinking the warrior is able to attain significantly
more hp. If not theres so much WAR/RNG gear around now that they're likely
to be pretty much the same. After 40 the ranger stops gaining defensive
skill ups, and falls behind pretty rapidly. 

Rangers remain effective tanks all the way through the game, but not
*as* effective, and highly dependant on gear. I know plenty of rangers
tanking tier 3 pop with luclin era gear and a few AA.
