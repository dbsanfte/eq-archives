You will do great in Kunark despite what others say. In LOIO you can hunt in
the area toward Cabilis and also in Field of Bone or Kurns Tower in Field of
Bone. I would go to Kurns as you received dungeon exp bonus and you can pull
to the nearby zone out to FOB if you get into difficulties. Swamp of No hope
will offer some hunting for you as well. Level quickly to around 20 and you
will do well in the area between FV zone and Windmill in LOIO (Lake of Ill
Omen)

You can bank and resuplly in Firiona Vie
