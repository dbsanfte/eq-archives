Today when I tried to logon and play, I find that I can no longer get past
the Everquest Patch window. Within the patch window It says:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Checking for new files, please wait...

EverQuest file update failed.  If the problem persists, contact your network
administrator or internet service provider for assistance.
(patch.everquest.com:7000TCP)

*ERROR*. Access is denied.

I haven't made any changes to my computer or anything. I was playing
yesterday and all seemed well. Can anyone help me get playing again?  This
just happened out of the blue!
