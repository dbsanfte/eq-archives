Totally wrong. Apples and oarnges. One case is a person holding down
*three* spawns that he's not actually <camping>. He's off someplace else
then "popping in" to claim the kill. Not a camp.

In this case, that's just what the OP was doing. Ok, so he killed Hadden
three times. Then he logged off the character. Camp over. End of
discussion. The wizard was right and got screwed by a non-honarable
pussy claiming the PnP clause.
