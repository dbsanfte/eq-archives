It tells you that the game is about progressing, which low-level
characters can do in the existing zones, but high level characters
can't keep doing unless the game expands in the high end.

Only if you've already been through the whole game.  If you haven't,
level 1 is the beginning, and you can probably start over at least
once and repeat almost nothing.  Finding people to group with is, of
course, a problem, since most people who start playing want to get to
70 as soon as possible, since everyone thinks that's where the game
starts.
