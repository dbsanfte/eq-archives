The Needlites should mostely be Dark Blue to you. I just took a Level 33
Cleric there to max out defensive skills as I had never been hit prior to
that ( imagin that a cleric sitting on his but medding never getting to
fight )  Took about 2 hours of soloing to max out all my Defensive and
Offensive skills.  On a side note loot every Stinger Wing and Leg. these
sell well in the Bazaar after you do the faction quest, maybe even before. I
mad almost 250 Plat off those drops, not including the Needlite Queens
drops.
