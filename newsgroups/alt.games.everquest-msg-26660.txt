My understanding is that "count" was only useful for /who all's.  I use it
from time to time to get an accurate feel for server population (when I'm
reeeaaally bored).  I take a count of all the rogues, bards, monks (usually
about 4% each) and then the druids and necros (~13-15%).

You can find out how many are live on the server just by "/who all count"
