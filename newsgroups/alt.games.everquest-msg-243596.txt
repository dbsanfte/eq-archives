Ahh.. removed from the equation.. hunt them down? GM Kill those SOB's
off Everquest? Maybe if you got a couple like minded individuals
together and could take it upon yourself you'd have what used to be
called a lynch mob.

When you make the differentiations between you and other people in
order to seperate yourself from them, and then call for their
destruction, yeah.. i'm not kidding.

>Since when can a legitamate grudge be compared to racism.

Call it prejudice. As if the color of a person's skin was the only
thing humans ever discriminated over. I could ask 10 people at a
workplace to wear a badge on their arms that says 'american', maybe 5
people would accept and then get pissed at the other 5 for not and
over time look to change them until they conform. Its when you seek to
make distinctions and then 'remove people from the equation' that you
are one step short of throwing on the white hood and calling yourself
the Klan. Its a slippery slope my friend, all you have yet to get is
the power to inact your will, lets pray you never have it.

Its not a game to win or lose.. i've stated that elsewhere in this
thread. Its a world and how you choose to interact in it is up to you.
Where most people look at me weirdly is when I state that that world
is no different from the one we currently inhabit in anything other
than interface and imagination. The actual comment you caught on was
more a taunt to those who do see it as a game. If we consider 65 with
all AA winning.. then having a 65 and not being able to generate plat
should be considered losing.
