With the shortage of healers in DL at most times (on my server anyway), its
up to if the druid chooses you. Chances are if the druid decides to leave,
they will be shouting for a healer for the next 20 mins.
I never take any crap as a cleric in DL.
As for the original poster, I think it was just a troll.
People who envy druids should just play one themselves. Find out the
