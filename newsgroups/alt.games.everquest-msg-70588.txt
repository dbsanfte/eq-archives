Ok I didn't get time to read your whole post (lol, long) but I think Final
Fantasy X will satisfy you. Summons long introduction in a battle can be
skipped, infact if you play the demo, the battles go like 10x faster then
any previous Final Fantasy game.

Fantasy is about imagination, and I think the ones on the PSone have
captured that. 8 was my favorite for the PSone, just because it tried
something new, but when 9 showed up I was disappointed they went back to the
old clunky deformed people look. A deformed look was fine on the SNES due to
the lack of technology, but I don't think it fits well with Final Fantasy.
You can even see in the drawings of the artist of previous Final Fantasy
games that they where human, not deformed.

LOL, playing on a 13" screen, I think that is your problem not Squaresofts.
Let me ask you a question, how is a pre-rendered backround any different
from a static 2D backround? Anyways, good thing Final Fantasy X features all
3D backrounds.
