Assuming a continuum that goes from 1.0 to 10.0, where 1.0 represents an
MMOG that is populated by players who always solo and never group, and 10.0
is represented by MMOGs that is populated by players who always group and
never solo, how would you rate each of the games?

Here's my perspective:

Ultima Online:    3.0
EverQuest:    9.5
Asheron's Call:    7.5
Anarchy Online:    6.5
Asheron's Call 2:    2.5
Star Wars Galaxies: 6.0
Planetside: 10.0
City of Heroes:    8.5

I'd be interested in any perspective players have here on the WoW beta
experience.
