Theres been good advice in this thread; generally, dont try and run unless
your healer is OOM, root adds, focus everyone on one target with /assist,
use /yell (put it on a hotkey if you type slow), and communicate roles
and strategies beforehand. 

Two small things though: If you haven't,. go to your trainer and put
a point in taunt. Secondly, if you get in trouble as a paladin you can
buy a few seconds to yell for a heal by using your blind spell line
(starts with flash of light, I believe) and backing out of combat.

Once you get below a certain percentage of your health mobs "frenzy" on
you, knowing you're almost dead, and it becomes very hard to taunt them
off - blind, AIUI, will help with this, perhaps even to the point you
can root them.

Keep a little mana for emergencies - count "OOM" as "1 bubble" and you'll
be surprised how often you save yourself or others when everythings to
the wall.

And... remember to have fun ;) it is a game, not a military excercise in
efficiency ;) Find folks you like, explain your ideas to the group, ask
their opinions, and so on. Its far better when you're chatting, learning and
enjoying time with your groupies rather than wondering what they think of you
or if you're doing something 0.25% percent below maximum efficiency.

"Hell, guys, what do you think would happen if we jumped down there?"

"Dunno."

"Want to try it?"

"Sure, I have a few hours to kill...."

"Geroooonimoooooooo!"
