Doesn't scare me as much about changing the basic structure, other than
probably getting some of the real "Why the fuck can't you fix things,
dammit, we are paying $12.95 for this now!" people to back the hell off on
the "I'm paying for this shit" head bangers.  A lot of changes, even for
the interface they mentioned they are trying to put into the system,
including Bazaar, will affect a lot of things that will be in the game.
Heck... I saw one person who wore some armor that didn't have a correct
graphic and it futzed up her character but good...  Required a GM to try a
few dozen things just to fix it.  Let's not forget the fact that in some
zones, Beastlords are literally losing their pets, preventing them from
playing in that zone as a beastlord.

Now mind you, Quality Assurance is only as good as how much real world
practices is put into it.  Even Luclin Beta Testers don't always do things
to as evil as it can be to weed out all the bugs, and in some cases, a
heavy load setup, such as having 1k people jamming at one time, or having
the random LD issue happen, will mimic every little incident possible.

Just to give you an idea -

1) A player who dies, gets sent back to his bind point, but something funky
 happens...  He is unable to zone out, the /who all doesn't show him, but
in the zone a /who shows him.

2) Beastlord zones into a zone without his warder...  Zones out into the
zone he was previously in or another zone, he has his warder.

3) You run to zone, and somehow...  You don't zone, you just keep going and
get to a dead end.  But you are able to back out and zone.

These things happen, a context that cannot be explained or easily
duplicated or forseen, even in programming. Not every situation can be
duplicated or created to catch the problem, and this comes from a beta
tester.
