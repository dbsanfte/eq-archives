My cleric just turned Level 11 and have had the hardest time reaching each
level.  I've been to Crushbone, NRO, Oasis (dry bones always get me), and
East commons; yet still it seems like forever to level.  My played time is
around 13 days... this just seems slow to me.   I usaully group with a
friend mine theat is a lvl 12 fighter and whom ever wants to join us
(usually level 9 or ten).

Is this slow leveling normal?  Or is there a better method of leveling?

Right now my best method of getting xp is turning in bone chips to Pal guild
in Kaladim.

Any suggestions are fully welcomed!
