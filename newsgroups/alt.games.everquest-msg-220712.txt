Teaadas is young by Elven standards, only 87 years old, but he's traveled
most of Norrath and Luclin, thanks to the confusing portal systems. He
doesn't care for magic, it confuses the elf out of him. He's mastered some
easy spells, like Spirit of Wolf, but just thinking about casting a spell
that discombobulates him and makes him appear in a completely different land
makes his head hurt. He'd much rather sit in the forest waiting for his
quarry, be it an Orc or a Dark Elf, to walk into view, then unleash a fury
of arrows upon it before it can utter the word "Ouch." Speaking of the
Teir'Dal, Teaadas hates them with a passion. He doesn't like to hate, but he
can't help it. After all, a Dragoon murdered his father. He's spent the last
ten years hunting down the Dragoon and waging his own personal war against
the Humans of Freeport and HighKeep. To him, anyone who harbors a Dark Elf
is just as bad as one. That isn't to say he hates each and every Teir'Dal he
meets, he knows that even a Dark Elf can do good. Speaking of "good" Dark
Elves...

Veldaria is even younger than Teaadas, only 19 years old. At the age of
seventeen her father caught her reading material on Fizzlethorpe
Bristlebane. Her father, a devout worshipper of Innoruuk, immediately took
her to his friend, Sergeant C'Orm of the Indigo Brotherhood. After being
interrogated for hours by the Sergeant, she confessed to following the way
of the King of Thieves. Enraged, C'Orm beat her around until she was
unconcious, and then had his way with her. She was then banished from
Neriak, thrown out into the wilds of Nektulos Forest, forever branded a
traitor to her own race. Veldaria wandered aimlessly through the woods until
she collapsed at the entrance of the Lavastorm Mountains. She was discovered
soon after by Cyspeth Romtai, a gypsy who was headed out to the forest to
forage some herbs. Cyspeth took her back to the camp where the gypsies
looked after her. After being nursed back to health, Veldaria told the
gypsies her story. Realizing that if the Teir'Dal discovered they were
taking after her, they would all surely be killed. Cyspeth and the other
gyspies taught Veldaria how to fend for herself and gave her supplies. They
then sent her off and told her to seek refuge in Freeport. She wouldn't be
welcome anywhere else. To this day Veldaria, now a rogue and apprentice of
Harkin Duskfoot, still lives in Freeport.

Xibben is an example of how appearances can be deceiving. To the unknowning,
Xibben would appear to be a harmless Gnome with a rockin' goatee. What they
don't know, however, is that Xibben is as cold-hearted as they come. He
takes great pleasure into torturing and murdering anything that even looks
at him the wrong way. Being weak physically, Xibben uses the undead to do
his maniacal bidding. A devout follower of the Plaguebringer, Xibben loves
all that has to do with disease and death. He'll often happen upon an
innocent bystander, maybe a gnoll pup, and curse it with a debiliatating
disease. Just powerful enough so that it sickens the pup to near-death, but
weak enough so that Xibben can leave for days and come back to watch it die.
Xibben hides his true desires well and is free to walk through nearly every
city on Norrath, except for Oggok, of course. To the good-inclined cities,
he's a silly, harmless Gnome, with odd hobbies. To the evil-inclined cities,
he's a disturbed maniac, someone to be respected. Xibben's dream is to one
day concoct a plague strong enough to kill an entire city, maybe Qeynos, and
turn them into his undead slaves.

Makes me wish I had decided to play on the FV server when I started all
those characters.
