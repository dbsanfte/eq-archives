You are certainly the perfect counterexample!

I'm trying to figure out what differences there might be between your
warrior and my beastlord.  My beastlord is my highest level character,
so outright twinking was basically impossible (no hand-me-downs, etc.).
 I rarely farmed greens, except for some faction work.  I did a little
farming of the BB goblins, when I was younger.

I did make a point of hunting in zones with better money (e.g. Dulak)
rather than the bestest possible xp, so I was consciously looking for
cash to buy upgrades, rather than seeking out items for trade.  I think
this is the difference.  My focus was on getting money, not in looking
for drops, as a vehicle for upgrading gear.

On one hand, I could also claim that I earned everything that my
beastlord is wearing.  However, only two pieces of his gear were looted
from kills he participated in.  The dropped gear that he accumulated
was either given to alts or sold in the bazaar for a fraction of what I
might pay to purchase an actual upgrade to the appropriate slot.  I
imagine that this is probably typical of most players.  Your way sounds
more fun.

It is noteworthy that you mention a warrior, arguably one of the most
gear-dependent classes.  Did you share Xiphos' experience of feeling
yourself undergeared at any stage?  If so, how did you deal with it?
Now that you are getting raid and DON loot, you are probably beyond
most of what is found in the bazaar and as well geared as anyone you
group with.
