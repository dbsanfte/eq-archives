As per the first site I provided, it was adopted in July, 1999 by the NCCUSL
(National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws.  It has passed
in Virginia, Maryland, California, Illinois, Oklahoma, and others, and was
under consideration in several other states.  I'm not sure when it was
passed in California.

There's a *lot* of stuff you need to read about it on the first site I gave.
Also, pop UCITA into any search engine.
