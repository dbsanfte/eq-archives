Aye, that's my concern with games that try to "do it better", that they 
wind up with everyone pretty much doing the same thing, just using 
lightning instead of swords, meditation instead of heal spells and classes 
being more about looking different than filling roles.

I like to have more in a MMORPG than highly-personalizable avatars that 
don't offer anything fundamentally unique.

That said, from what I've read, I am very much looking forward to WoW. Of 
course, I'm very much looking forward to EQ2 as well. Ah, hell, maybe I'm 
just too easy to please. :P
