I haven't had any problem with eq for years, now all of a sudden since
the last patch I'm having a blue screen pop up, I haven't been able to
ready what it says because I'm usually doing something, and as soon as
any button is pressed it goes away.  Then it comes back to the eq screen
and it's black.  I've had this happen 3 times so far.  The first two it
was when I wasn't doing anything terribly important, but last night it
was when I was in a fight.  This obviously freeked the hell out of me. 
I was lucky to be in a good group, as there was a mob pounding on my
enchanter that I was trying to mez when this happened, I thought quickly
and remembered that others have had had a problem with a black screen
and hitting alt-enter fixed it.  I tried that and got my screen back.  

Luckily I was with a good group, when I came back the mob was still
pounding on me but I had been healed and they got it off of me a second
later...

I'm just afraid this is going to happen again at an even less oportune
time.

Is anyone else experiencing this? or have a fix.

I'm running Win98 1st ed, and have 728mb of ram and 1.4ghz amd
proccessor, with a raedeon 7200.
