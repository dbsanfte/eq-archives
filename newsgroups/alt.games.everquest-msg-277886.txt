Its really *not* that hard to zone in without having a high lev clear 
the area. Especially as a paci class. Hell... you've got divine aura.

I vaguely recall them being quite magic resistant too. My bard often had 
issues keeping them mezzed/slowed. =/

That was dumb, glad he learned his lesson. :)

I'm guessing that neither you nor the necro have your sense/disarm trap 
spells yet?

Chests, for all that people avoid them are remarkably simple and 
generally very safe to open with the appropriate classes and spells, and 
players who have a clue what to do. Perhaps the rewards in them tend to 
not be great, but its practically free xp, and occasionaly you do get 
something worth getting.

Even if you are going to go the 'stupid' route and smash them open (and 
risk destroying the contents), the key is to simply use a single bask or 
kick to see what gets set off. This way you will only set it off once... 
instead of having someone hasted quadding it with dual wield/double 
attack...last thing you need is 400x4 AE DDs multiple times per tick. 

If its the DD nuke for 400, you walk away. If its the curse that doubles 
your casting time or some long duration dot that you can manage... go 
nuts.

Be a -lot- simpler to just pick up an invis potion to get by the 
gargoyles. I'd expect you aren't KOS to live frogs & minotaurs, and 
other than that one 4 spawn of gargoyles you should be able to get to 
the safe hall without leapfrogging, or even really having to try.
