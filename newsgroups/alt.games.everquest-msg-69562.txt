Good afternoon ))  First time poster but i read the NG fairly regularly.  I
am in need of some advice as I have tried everything I can think of and that
has been posted in the NG and still nothing is working for me.

System Specs.
Athalon 800
WinXP- Home Ed.
1024 Meg Memory
GeForce 2 64 Meg Vid
DirectX 8.1

HD was wiped and WinXP loaded.  I bought the video card/memory.  I done the
following.....reinstalled DirectX8.1 and then drivers for Sound, Video,
Monitor and mouse.

EQ will get through the Patcher screen (I have Luclin installed) and then
goes black with a tiny spec of white/red light in the upper left corner of
the monitor and then XP restarts telling me I have the following error:

Now I had a GeForce 2 card made by PNY and thought it was bad, it was only a
week old and took it back to the store and exchanged for a Xtasy Brand
GeForce 2 as they were out of the PNY's but I am still getting the same
error .  Anyone have a clue how to correct this?

Thanks
