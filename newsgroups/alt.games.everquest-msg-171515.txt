Does your ISP use static or dynamic (DHCP) IP addressing? Most use
DHCP, so I will offer suggestions based on that. You should also call
your ISP and see if there are any specific settings you need to have
on your PC such as DNS servers.

If you are running Win9X click on START->RUN and type in "winipcfg"
(no quotes) then hit enter.

If you have Win2K or WinXP click on START->RUN then type in "cmd" (no
quotes) and hit enter. At the command prompt type "ipconfig" (no
quotes). 

You should see a TCP/IP number for the Realtek card. The number should
*NOT* start with 192.xxx.xxx.xxx or 169.xxx.xxx.xxx. The number should
be consistent with the number range assigned by your ISP. You will
have to call and ask them what the number should be if you are unsure.
If the number is wrong or you are unsure try the following...

1. Shut off the PC
2. Unplug the cable modem
3. Wait 1 minute
4. Plug in the cable modem and wait for it to finish initializing and
connection to the cable companies network (usually 1-2 minutes or
until the lights stop blinking and go solid green depending on modem
model)
5. Turn on the PC and boot into Windows
6. Check the IP number again with winipcfg (or ipconfig) as noted
above.

They should have phone support that can walk you through the basics.
