A 60 cleric in my guild was telling us that his Spec Alteration was broken
because it wouldn't go over 50.  After convincing him that he really should
go check the trainer and make sure that he hadn't forgotten to train one of
them, he discovers that he forgot to train Conjuration and Divination.

So he put a point in, and they were both set to 60.  He had to do the Sol Ro
quest to reset them.

I think this has been fixed now.  Instead of new skills being set to your
level, they are now set to the level at which you were first able to train
in the skill.  I think.

I noticed this when I trained my roguelet in Parry one level late.
