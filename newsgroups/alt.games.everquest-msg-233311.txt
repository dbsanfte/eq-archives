What you're attempting to do is called "AE kiting", not swarm kiting.
Swarm kiting involves the use of charm (level 27 song).

There are a number of ways to do AE kiting without getting hit (provided
the mob's melee range is smaller than the range of your AE song).  One of
the simpler ways is to run in a square pattern (some call this box
kiting)... you run till you're a certain distance from the mob, start your
AE song, then take an abrupt right turn.  If you time both the turn and the
song right, you will DoT the mobs, and they won't touch you.  After the
turn, you rinse and repeat, probably with your second AE song (level 18).
From these "run straight and right turns" you will be running a square or
rectangular at least, pattern.  Now you can vary the angle of the turn and
get other patterns such as a triangle, pentagram, etc., but you'll need to
change the timing of the song and distance from the mobs at which you begin
your turn.  The deal is, if you make the angle consistent, it will become
more easy to judge the distance and the timing.
