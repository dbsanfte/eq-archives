  Actually.... I bet it was a Chevy. My girlfriend has a big thing for cars
(I don't share this passion with her, odd that). Apparently a friend of hers
who is a mechanic and has made two Street Rods for himself told her
something about Chevy small block engines in a Volvo.
  I suppose it's one of those "Because I can" things... I like those.
