I'm not a lawyer, so this argument probably won't hold any water...  First
off, the Kunark boxes are an old product, done in the days when DX6 was all
you needed.  DX6 ran under Win95, as did DX7.  Kunark itself (as well as
Velious) technically run on Win95.  Enter Microsoft, who in their wisdom, no
longer allows DirectX to run on Win95.  So although the game itself is
perfectly capable of being executed by the Win95 kernel, the new underlying
multimedia archetecture imposed by Microsoft no longer allows such things to
be possible.  Whether the people at Verant could successfully be accused of
false advertising, I really don't know.  In a way, the Kunark boxes are
right, as long as DX8.1 isn't a part of the picture.  At that point, I think
it's equally Microsoft's fault.
