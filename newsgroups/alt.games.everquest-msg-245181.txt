Hot Spots! 
Try out the new Hot Spot zones which give a boost to Experience while
adventuring in them.  The current Hot Spots are:
The Castle of Mistmoore
The Lair of the Splitpaw
Dulak's Harbor
The Tower of Frozen Shadow
The Gulf of Gunthak
Hate's Fury
The Crypt of Nadox
The Torgiran Mines
The Hot Spot zones will shift from time to time, so watch for messages
giving clues as to where the new ones may be.
Good luck!
 

That's live on test.

Expect it to go live on prods maybe as soon as tomorrow.

Some interesting choices in there. Paw was actually excellent exp
beforehand, it was only empty because of its distance from any pok
book (another knock on stupid PoK, worst zone ever). It must be insane
now. Most the LoY zones were only okay to bad exp before, but were
rather fun to play in, so this is a great improvement for them.
