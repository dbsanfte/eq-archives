Personally I don't think there is much available (and affordable) that I can
get with the same AC but I maybe missing something so suggestions welcome.

Oddly, Magelo lists my weight (armour and weapons?) as only 53...this is
under half what I normally start out with, so either magelo isn't counting
something or I am lugging some real heavy food about :ï¿½/
