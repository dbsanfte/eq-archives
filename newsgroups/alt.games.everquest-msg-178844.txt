Safer yes.  About the same exp rate?  hell no.  Almost every zone (infact I
can't think of any where its not true..  but im sure it is somewhere) where
you can exp, a charmed mob will do MUCH more damage than a pet..  in most
cases it will outdamage a player or 2, too.

Whilst the chars have a noticable level difference, just re-ensnaring the
mob will keep it off your chanter (to safely recharm) whilst your druid
remains safe.
