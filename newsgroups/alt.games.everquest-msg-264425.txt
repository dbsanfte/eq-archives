This actually brings up a new point. Something I have been hearing over 
and over is how a large percentage of the population get disillusioned 
when they hit the early 20s and start over. From what you are saying, it 
looks like you did the same. Is that correct?

Another thing that greatly disturbs me, is that I've read a TON of 
boards and info on this game and I have seen a grand TOTAL of 1 poster 
that reached level 40+ in the game, and yet no concrete info on what 
actually exists for high level content in the game.
