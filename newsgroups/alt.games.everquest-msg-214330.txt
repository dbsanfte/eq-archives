Sorry, should have been more clear.  I 'have' a sound card and
speakers.  I recently moved my computer set-up, and now I get some
weird radio single / cross-talk whenever I have the speakers on.
*really* annoying. Think it might be some wiring in the wall (old
house), but I like the location and haven't got around to yanking out
the old wiring yet.
