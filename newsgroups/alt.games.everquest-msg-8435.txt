For some reason as a Paladin,  I get volunteered for pulling.  I want
to start using a Bow and arrow instead of just meleeing the 'mob' to
aggro it.

   My question is.... for the purpose of pulling/aggroing a mob to
follow me; does it matter what bow and arrow combination I use?  Is
there any point getting anything more expensive than the most basic
bow and arrows.   Does it matter my skill level?  [I know better bow
and better skill more damage on the pull, but just for pulling does it
make a difference?]

                 Is just the fact I am shooting at the 'mob' enough to
aggro it.


   A related question.  I use to use flash of light to pull mobs,  but
I thought  it had a tendency to aggro everything around the mob.(it
was not very selective.)    Is flash of light really any different
than using a bow an arrow or melee for that matter.   If a nearby mob
is going to be aggroed, will any aggro, make it  equally likely for it
to come after me?
