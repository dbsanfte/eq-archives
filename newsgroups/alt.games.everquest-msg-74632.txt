I live in the UK and play it too, if your local shop doesn't have the Full
EQ only the addon's your best bet is to order it from Amozon.co.uk and get
the trilogy pack. This contains Everquest and two add ons, Kunark and
Velious.

You can play it fine with a 56k modem as when we play the servers arn't that
busy, IE all the yanks are asleep in bed. Bar the hard core gamers.

Also not you WILL need a good GFX card like a GForce2 or better, lots of ram
128 is the min, but ya better with 500+

They have also started a European server up now too, havent tryed it as all
my players are on the older servers.

Good luck and welcome to a world where you will not get much sleep, spend
much time going out, get a sore bum from sitting at the computer too much
etc etc.
