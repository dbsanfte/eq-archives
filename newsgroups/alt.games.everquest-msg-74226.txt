The loss of Velious leather graphics and the ugliness of the revamped
version of the old leather graphics for female wood elves have gone a
long way towards hosing my desire to get anything with a leather
graphic in the tunic/leggings department. That includes Thurg and SS
quest armors (tizmak pattern) as well as the absolutely stunning
Nathsar/Harmony armors (kelp pattern)...to Luclin, they're all bland
leather with perhaps a green or purple tint.

They made up entirely new chain patterns, and modeled the new plate
patterns on Velious plate, so why they gave Luclin leather based on
boring old world stuff when they had two spectacular Velious leather
patterns to play with instead is beyond me (It's probably another
druid nerf :p )
