I was in the closed and open beta of MxO.  The game had a lot of promise. 
It was very ambitious with regard to classes and archetypes ... to put it in 
EQ parlance, if you rolled up a warrior but your group needed a cleric, you 
simply unloaded your character's warrior attributes and loaded cleric 
attributes.  Whammo ... instant cleric.  This ability to class shift was 
interesting.

The combat interface was wonky.  If you were a pet class attacking a mob, 
when the combat engine determined it was time for your pet to attack you 
were moved out of the way and you pet slid into position next to the mob to 
attack .. even if the pet was using a ranged weapon.

It suffers from the same sort of mission repetitiveness that CoH suffers 
from as well.  IMO, anyway .. I know CoH is still cranking, so some folks 
must like it. ;-)

Either Monolith was over their heads in making a MMO game, or WB rushed it 
out the door in an effort to strike before the Matrix iron was completely 
cold.

That being said, I still have the client on my machine.  If it becomes part 
of my Station AAP, I might fire it back up.  But as far as being a paying 
customer .. I got enough of it in beta.
