Also file a bug report with Verant.  If they are going to make EQ so
that it won't let you switch to other apps via the Windows key (or
alt-tab) gracefully, then it is *their* bug that EQ doesn't disable
those keys.

Note that you used to be able to remap the Windows key in EQ.  I used to
use that as my autoattack key.  You can't do it anymore from the GUI,
but it might work if you edit the key mapping file directly.
