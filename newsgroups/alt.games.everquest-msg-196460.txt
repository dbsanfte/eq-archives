OK, doing outdoor work in Marus Seru and FM giants I had more
opportunity to use this.

Pulling it had very little effect, since I'm SOWed I'm already
faster than the mobs, and they aren't all that much slower than
before snared.  I suppose it did make it a bit easier to stick a
slow or DOT on the incominb mob... except that if I pulled with
one of those spells, I wouldn't need to be casting it on an
incoming mob at all.  It doesn't seem to slow them sufficiently
to make the DOT, move, DOT plan effective unless you have a LOT
of running room, can't use the bard trick of running in circles
around them.  It was handy that it has a decent range and cost no
mana; if you are pulling easy mobs you don't want to bother
dotting or slowing, a clicky saves a spell slot and a bit of mana
every time.

I'm quite convinced it would be useless for fear kiting purposes,
not much slower than unsnared, short duration, and 6 second cast
time.  My cleric is no longer eating his heart out that he wasnt
born an Innothule worshipper.

Where it did come in handy was runners.  Runners in Marus Seru
and FM are trouble.  They run from your nice safe pull spot right
out into more mobs.  Unless you are fighting in Kurns (or other
mobs which never run)  or certain areas where you  can pull back
far enough to let mobs run,  Or if your party can kill fast
enough that they won't get far, this can be pretty dangerous.  I
was able to start snare when mobs turned to run and land it
before they got out of range consitantly, only problem being the
occaisional resist.

The snare is a bit pathetic, the mobs actually keep running, just
slower; they tend to start running at around 20% health and don't
get to RIP (running in place) till around 10% hp.   The duration
is short enough that in some cases it wears off before the mob is
dead!

Soloing, it can be a problem because the cast time is long enough
that you can't stick it before the mob runs, fast mobs like
Lightcrawlers can get out of range before it sticks fi you can't
start it early.  With a partner, on this sort of mob, I'd let him
get aggro and start the snare shortly before the run point was
reached, or even back off into the running path and cast it as
the mob ran past me.

All in all, I'm glad I have it, but at the same time, not nearly
so bummed that my cleric doesn't.
