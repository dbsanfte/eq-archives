No, its a phenomena of verant being sloppy. They eventually fix it by
having the npc attack as they did with the gnome vendor in freeport
people used as a "trainer." So don't worry, one day the people
whacking on the Soubinders will get a surprise ;) Another NPC you can
do the same thing with is Izera the dark elf for a dismal rage quest,
she is in SRO.

The guy is still availible to players for binding purposes. That
inconsiderate jerk does not WANT to kill him, so don't worry ;)
Similarly Izera can still have the quest note handed to her in sro
while someone is beating on her (but sadly this quest is STILL BROKE
ANYWAY)

Actually its more complex, I think they have to REWRITE the soulbinder
or other npcs like that so they attack (or just turn on attack for
them) Either way, they can only do that by a server side zone patch
once they fix it.
