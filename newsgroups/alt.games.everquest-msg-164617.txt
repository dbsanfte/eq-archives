Windblade does not appear to even be the best ratio 2 hander for a warrior
anyway, it's just a lot more common, or was anyway.  There is one that is
supposed to drop in CT with an even better ratio.  There is at least one
person in my guild that has a Windblade, purchased in the bazaar.  It is not
that hard to get one if you really want to.
