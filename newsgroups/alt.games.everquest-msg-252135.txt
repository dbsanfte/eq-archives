Hush! Don't spread the word or everyone's gonna be heading to GoD. <g>

Before the revamp, I think that one could make a good case that GoD
was basically useless for the casual gamer. My usual exp group is
pretty solid but we weren't going to advance through the GoD trials
since we don't have a warrior or an enchanter. I saw how the first
named in the mountain trial tore through a PoTime lvl SK that I often
group with. No way our group was ever going to complete that. 

  So, if you ignored the trials, GoD basically gave your average, well
equiped 65, 2 zones to hunt in; Riwwi and Barundi (and the exp sucked
in both). Add Ferubi if you pushed yourself and had a group that could
handle a hard LDoN with relative ease. I think it's understandable why
a lot of non-raiders (myself included) didn't think they got their
money's worth. 

GoD convinced me not to pre-order any more expansions, something I'd
always done up to now because  love exploring new content with a good
group. Whether I'm going to bother with OoW will mainly depend on how
many flagged zones there are. Maybe it's just burnout on my part but
I'm done paying money for content that I have to tediously unlock. 

Rgds, Frank
