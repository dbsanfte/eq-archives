Actually, it doesn't appear exactly like that for primary hand weapons after
level 25. It appears as:

Soandso Scores a critcal hit!(57)
You hit a_mob_00 for 63 points of damage.

For whatever reason, the level damage bonus is not added to the bracketed
number, however it does get added to the total damage in the next line.
Also, the level damage bonus varies greatly for weapons with differing
speeds. At level 30, I get a bonus of 6 with the 48 delay Silvery 2h axe,
and a bonus of 40 with the 150 delay weighted axe. Kicks, slams and offhand
attacks do look the same as you wrote. I think your parser already takes
that into account, my highest blow is a critical and it did use the larger
number, but I thought I'd pass it on anyway.
