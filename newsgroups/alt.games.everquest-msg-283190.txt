I just spent about 10 hours with EQ2 courtesy of a 10-day free trial after 
being gone from it about a year.  I never played EQ, but if you want to see 
something that's really effed up, you should see EQ2.  After a year or more 
of "improvement" (I guess, since I never kept up), it's now worse than ever 
from what I could tell--and that's really saying something, since it wasn't 
all that in the first place.
