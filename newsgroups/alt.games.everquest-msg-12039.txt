I have the 32 meg PCI version.  I'm not mad about it but it'd be nice not to
have those black patches in the game.
In the cards settings, (such as under OpenGL Settings), I wish I know what
stuff to check to have the card working it's best but not sure what settings
I should use for my card like the "Allow the dual planes extension to use
local video memory" and so on what all should I have checked and unchecked?
