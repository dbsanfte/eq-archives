Same mob types as the basement, a mix of burynais and skeletons,
with a little higher average levels. You'll find more sappers and 
lesser icebones/charbones in the tunnels, and the named burynai 
Bargynn.

While the tower part of Kurn's just screams out to be soloed --
all skeletons that aren't social, don't flee, and have very low
aggro radius -- the burynais are a nightmare. They are social, 
run early, and can be SKs, necros, shamans, or warriors. So you 
can wind up with one mob harmtouching you, another heating your 
blood, then they flee at SoW speed and get healed from outside 
aggro range. Snare is a must have here.
