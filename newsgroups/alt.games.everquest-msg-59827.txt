Well its only a lousy video game platform because many games are not
made to work under it. I've played quake 3 under it and it worked so
very well that I forgot I was in linux at all. Quake 3 and such will
always work well because ID has always made linux binaries. If other
game companies did the same thing as a matter of course and then stuck
them on their websites like ID does, maybe people would see it as a
possiblity.

Neverwinter nights is going to be the first wide release popular
commercial retail game which actually comes with the ability to also
be ran under linux out of the box (as well as several other
OS/systems.) Of course there won't be anyway to really tell which of
the users bought it for that reason except perhaps through an
aftermarket survey/webpage. 

I for one will be playing it under SuSE linux instead of in windows
sometimes, just because I can ;)

Like the neverwinter team said, if they plan that from the START
(rather than porting after the fact) its really incredibly trivial to
do.

That would also be why I'd play EQ under linux if it was possible,
because I COULD. Hmm in fact I think that is what linux REALLY needs,
imagine a popular MMORPG in the vien of EQ or daoc but ONLY for
linux/nix's. It would drastically increase the share of linux (at
least in multiboot) on home gamer systems. The problem is that due to
the openess of the open source community doubtless they'd also make a
windows binary which would make it impossible to see what kind of
numbers a linux only subscription MMORPG which was good could field.
That is unfortunately what unix free operating systems need to be
validated for gaming, a killer gaming app like that which is only
availible for them.
