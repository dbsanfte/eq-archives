Yeah, I agree... I avoided EC like the plague back when it was the
center.  and if they moved it to PoK, I wouldn't be able to avoid it
because of the portal stones..   Guess Id have to make a hot key to
filter out Auc, OOC, and Shout just to tolerate the zone... and then
how would i find out about my wonderful Aego / FoS / KEI dealers?

Hmm... Ok so you  decide you don't want to buy it... and the item goes
into the "brokers" inventory?... are you saying that the money has
already been given to the Trader char?

naw, PC is crowded because it is the absolute best exp for that level.
If there is another one, Please name it.  PC was busy before the
bazaar took off.
