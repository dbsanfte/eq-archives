It's an remnant of old. Rangers used to be low hp, low ac up to and
including most of velious era. They were regarded not as a melee dps type,
like a rogue, but as a warrior/druid tanking hybrid, not unlike paladins or
shadowknights, and for that role tey were highly unfit. Enrage would drop
rangers faster then pets and tanking in expgroups was rather pointless.
All ranger jokes basically came from then. Present day rangers are respected
damage dealers with some moderate utility, but the old jokes still are
around a lot.

My guild has a running gag with rangers as well, mostly because the few
times they draw aggro they're also down within seconds still (standing on a
ledge in the pull-path of flurry drakes in ntov is always a good one).
