Ooh, me!  Me!  Pick me!  (For the bitching, I mean, not the betting.)

In general this is a great feature and long overdue.  But I do have
one concern about it "dumbing down" a certain aspect of tradeskills
too much.  Currently, part of the challenge of tradeskilling is
discovering the more obscure "recipes" (especially those required
for quests) by a combination of trial-and-error and brilliant insights.

I wonder how many "mystery" recipes will suddenly become simply a matter
of "pick it from the screen menu", instead of the "follow the clues"
mystery game they were intended to be.
