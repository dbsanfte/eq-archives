"Infusion of the Faithful" - big boost to stats and resists for 15
minutes, which is handy to pretty nearly any class, really.  Nice for
emergencies, as the resists all max to 255   : )  [Note: this DOESN'T
just affect Run speed, as the description below says]

"Veteran Rewards are as follows:
 
Year 1
 
Lesson of the Devoted: A character will gain double-XP for 30-minutes
every 24 hours. When this reward is in effect, the character will be
surrounded by a special blue-white glow.  
 
Year 2
 
Infusion of the Faithful: This reward grants increased run speed for
15 minutes once every 24 hours.  
 
Year 3
 
Chaotic Jester: Once every 24 hours, a character can summon a
Bristlebane puppet for 15 minutes. During that time, the puppet
randomly casts various spells that provide benefits or minor
penalties.  

Year 4

Expedient Recovery: Once a week, this "Back to New" reward summons all
of a player's corpses back to him, and gives back all XP that was on
the corpses.

Year 5

Steadfast Servant: Once every 24 hours, a creature is summoned that
stays in the area for a half hour, buffing and healing player
characters nearby.  
Year 6
 
Staunch Recovery: Once every three days, a character is healed back to
full health, mana, and endurance.  
 
Year 7
 
Intensity of the Resolute: Once every 24 hours, a character's melee
attacks, damage spells and heals are increased for five minutes. When
this reward is in effect, the character will be surrounded by a glow
of energy"
