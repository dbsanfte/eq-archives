Generally speaking, just about anything made with racial meats (save 'em).

A few off the top of my head:

Blackened Tier'Dal: Dark Elf Parts+spices+garnish= +1dex +2int +1agi
Beer Braised Mammoth:  Mammoth meat+spices+short beer (I think)= +3str -1int
Hot Spicy Toelings:  Halfling Parts+spices+garnish= +2dex +2agi
Beer Braised Gator:  Gator meat+spices+short beer= +2str -1int

Most such recipes require a skill of 68+ to reliably produce.  Carrion Spiders
in EK drop halfling parts and Gator meat is usually available for loot in
Oasis.  Snake, bear and wolf meat also produce stat enhancing foods and are easy
to get at low levels, but I forget what the stats are.  There are also recipes
specific to Velious for which the ingredients are only attainable at high level
(ooooh, Pickled Drake, anyone?).
