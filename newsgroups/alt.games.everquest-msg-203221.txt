Not sure if its the same thing, but a buddie of mine was describing a
quest for a gnome there...  The idea was to get the gnome through
waves of mobs and the end mob was some dragon type.  My buddie ended
up with a nice haste no drop item.

Not sure if its the same thing.... hmm... maybe not now that I am
thinking about it, he mentioned several groups could do it together,
and what you described sounded like the Trials in PoJ where only one
group can do it.

oh well....
