I guess I was lucky.  When I started playing the game I never checked the
internet or newsgroups so I never knew how poor I was.  
You aren't doing anything wrong.  Things are slow when you are young.
ADVISE:  Don't buy weapons or armor from the vendors.  Go to the bazaar to do
your trading with other players.
If you can't go to the bazaar it doesn't hurt to try "/ooc WTB low end ranger
gear, don't have Luclin".  You might get lucky.
