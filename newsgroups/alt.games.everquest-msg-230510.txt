Didn't say it was all a bard was good for, just that it's the common
impression out there.  One of the nice things about playing a bard alt is
that I know when I've got a good bard in my group, and I know when I've got
a twink (ie, playing self-only melee buffs in a group or not twisting during
battle).  I also get on the case of other group members who try to insist
the bard twist during downtime.  That's just abusive.
