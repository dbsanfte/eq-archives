Shhhhh!  I currently have my baby bard at 29 and climbing nicely now I have
got charm worked out. If the dev team discovers we are having fun playing
the class then the old "Combine Bat of Nerfage" may be brought out of
retirement again...

Back to the subject of J-boots, in 100% attention situations like solo
charming they would be exceeding handy. I find that after I get a charm to
stick I twist a single healing song whilst hanging back and pay exceedingly
close attention to what is happening. The split second charm breaks I start
charming again whilst trying to keep distance from both mobs, SoW speed
would be handy for this, especially in confined spaces.

I am sure a fluid bard could twist selo's and heal in between charms - but
for me that would be too much a distraction. Besides when I am charming I am
using a Mino Horn and instrument swapping is still a pipedream for me.
