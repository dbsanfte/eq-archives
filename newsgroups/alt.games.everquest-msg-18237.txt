I think the biggest gripe about being surrounded by twinks
isn't that the items weren't "earned", but that the non-twink
is going to have to compete for a slot in a group against
twinks, and also that there's a twink slaughtering orcs
by the cartload with his Axe of the Ubertwink, while the
non-twink has to slog along barely surviving single
encounters with his Rusty Broken Bent Sword.

It's like real life -- the problem with "someone driving
a Mercedes Benz" isn't that they didn't "earn" it, it's
that they're more likely to get a date next Friday night...
Nothing wrong with that, of course, but the non-twink
is of course going to feel a bit at a disadvantage.
