Geez guy... you  should delete YOURSELF - next time put at least 5 points
into your INT

also it is a ROG - just like a monk is also MNK - right-click ANY
armor/weapon and find out who can wear it!

then complain to verant that they had YEARS to write EQ and should have not
abbreviated any classes - they could have made the names take up the whole
screen...

Who cares.. I still think my ROG is better than your ROUGE - heheh
