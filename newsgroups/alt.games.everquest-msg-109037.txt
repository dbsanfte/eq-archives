Point.  But your war analogy suffers from the lack of any long-term
penalty for being a turncoat (try that when dealing with people instead
of "hapless retards"), making it common behavior amongst some fraction
of the PC community (guilds trying to optimize their mix of Kael/SS
quest armor for example).  And the "aggressive monsters" are hardly
uniformly aggressive while the game does provide substantial in-game
reward for "attacking hapless little deformed retards" aka pharming
greens for loot.  Not to mention the still popular "dorf hunting" where
I would say that the BBM dwarves pretty well qualify as "hapless
retards" when the (mostly) Druids who slaughter "Kaladim citizens" are
not interfered with by the dwarf guards (not to mention that these
Druids are typically members of races supposedly allied with or
friendly to said dwarves and yet they suffer no harmful loss of
reputation for engaging in behavior best described as psychopathic
serial murder).  And you well know that these few examples only scratch
the surface of EQ's opportunities to advance a character in a seemingly
anti-roleplay fashion.

You're right, the mere fact of being hack-n-slash does not make a
game "evil".  EQ does however routinely reward allegedly "good"
characters for behavior that, on its face anyway, seems to be very
"evil".  Fortunately, directing a toon (sorry, couldn't resist) around
in an obviously non-real environment populated by obviously non-
intelligent NPCs distinguishes the game rather sharply from reality.
Makes it tough to argue rationally that the game itself is "evil".

Hmm, test protocol finished in the lab, guess it's time to go home and
make war upon some more aggressive monsters in the never-ending
struggle for "Loot, Levels, and the VerantVision Way".
