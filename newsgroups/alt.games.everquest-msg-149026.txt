Hardly.  Cleric has worn that crown since the beginning and there have been
no serious challengers.

Now if you mean most damaging class, I'd agree.  But then, *somebody* has to
be on top of that list, and rogues, rangers and magicians all have the
capability to exceed a monk given the right conditions.

Every class has an average damage and a ceiling.  Monks average is closer to
their ceiling than any class with a higher ceiling.
