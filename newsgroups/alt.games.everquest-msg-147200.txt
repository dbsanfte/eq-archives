Amen.  My Stun+DDs (same as yours, I believe) lost most of their value
with the caster AI change, because mob casters that could began buffing
their MR.  With the resist change they're now next to useless.  And I
know a lot of Druids/Rangers who'd gladly do without the debuffs in
their fire-based DoT line (most of the time, anyway) if that meant they
actually had a chance of landing the spell more often than they do now.
