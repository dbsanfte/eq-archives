What tool do we have? There is nobody who cares that someone spams the
channel with "new game XYZ" and posts a blatantly unsolicited
commercial message.

I did nothing but turn a spammer onto a little spam. I didnt report
him in any other way. I certainly didn't look up his ISP or the whois
for the URL. I certainly didn't start any vigilantism, as I have seen
it.

Google has not and I doubt will contact me about your complaint. I was
within my rights as a poster, and long time contributor here, to help
him with his mailto link.
