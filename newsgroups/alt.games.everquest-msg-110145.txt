It essentially has.  Takes a while to update the database from time to
time, I grant you.

Did I ever claim either of those statements?

As you well know, I never said there were no differences.  In fact,
what I said is directly quoted here:

Sept. 11 has been pretty roundly condemned by the world at large.  So
let's see here, do we go with what al-Qaeda says, or do we go with
what *everyone else in the whole frickin' world* is saying?  Hmmm,
tough call.

Slippery little devil, ain't ya?  Before it was "evil is entirely
subjective."  Now it's "evil is what people decide it is."

And there is indeed an "ultimate universal definition of 'good' and
'evil'"

What people decide it is :)
