Based on your selection of classes absolutely, both in PvE and RvR.  I spent
all of my time in Albion, taking an Avalonian Paladin to 50 and specializing
in 2 hand thrust weapons, a rare combination for sure, but I enjoyed it.
Study the different "specialization" options for each class before deciding
in any realm.

Not very much individualization really.

This is actually a necessity for a Realm to even remotely stand a chance in
the Realm Wars.  Without the aid of yoru peers there is no way to take keeps
and steal enemy relics>  Guinevere had an excellent community.  Check out
the board: http://vnboards.ign.com/board.asp?brd=20664

Decay is not really a worry, as the same stuff also will be below your level
before it truly falls apart, and at the highest levels the quested items and
artifacts do not really decay (they do, but their base durability is set far
above 100%)
