What?  Short for cartoon, you say?  Why so it is!  I never 
realized!</sarcasm>

The point is, I have yet to hear anyone refer to "Batman: The Animated 
Series" as a -toon-.  Yes, I have heard it referred to as a -cartoon-.  
Despite one being a shortened form of the other word, the usage is 
different.  This would support DT's argument that "comic book characters 
aren't generally referred to as "toons"."  And you yourself called Batman 
TAS "Batman the cartoon", didn't you?  Implying even -you- use the words 
differently.
