leveling can seem like a slow and boring process at times

you can find people that make it fun, and you most definitely should,
because that's the secret of everything


but honestly, once you get your level 29 spells (in some cases 34 is
noticeably better) you can do some of the most FUN quests there are - the
focus quests (the original broom ones!), and all sorts of other great things

you really should try to level to 30 . . .but the best reason is because it
really is much easier than you think


if you fought in paludal caverns, you could be 25 in about 5 hours of
playing time (more like 4 hours to 24, and then things could turn light
blue) . . netherbian lair and marus seru too - you can pretty easily level
to 30 in about 10-15 hours of playing (that's roughly 2-4 days depending on
how much you play . . unless you only play about 4 hours a week, in which
case that is a month)

also, can fight in the overthere and even though the exp is about 70% as
good as luclin zones, it will be fast (and fun if you go with fun people)


and now the bad news . . . (i'm not positive) i think if you don't worship
sol ro, you can't do quests in the temple of sol ro . . sorry

other dungeons, btw, like sol a and b (the 2 OTHER holes in the side of the
lava crater, soon as you exit temp of sol ro) will be excellent exp for you
(stay grouped! don't make enemies there) . . .any dungeon exp bonus makes up
for thinking that leveling is boring

will sternly tell you to avoid Frontier Mountains ( =FM) if you like exp . .
. it makes all levels hell levels
