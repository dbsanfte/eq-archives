The MP3 player is impressive, but unfortunately it's an all-or-nothing
proposition. Once engaged, it completely replaces all EQ music, meaning that
I lose the ability to hear the battlecry music announcing that my attack
mode is on.

I tried replacing the "combattheme1.mp3" and "combattheme2.mp3" files with
my own MP3s, and also the "eqtheme.mp3" with my own motivationsl cohices but
at startup the game simply downloads new versions replacing my files. One
workaround is to turn off auto-download during initialization and once the
download is complete, use Windows Explorer to once-again replace the files,
but that's a pain.

Is there a more simple solution, perhaps an edited .INI file, or some mp3
player command that I'm missing?

Many thanks, and oh yea, see you on the battelfield!
