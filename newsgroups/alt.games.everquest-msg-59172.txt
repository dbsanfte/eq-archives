A charm is a pet.

What's the point of charming?  Well, there's not a general point to it.  My
enchanter rarely charms because, well, charms don't last very long and
critters tend to be slightly miffed at the person who has taken over total
and unasked for control of their bodies.

Charm isn't useless, but it's not up there on the list of Most Useful.  As a
necro I suppose if you're stuck with green pets and you come across a blue
or better undead critter you need for a few minutes then that'd be a good
time to mem up that spell.  My enchanter rarely has it memmed unless mezzing
isn't an option and adds are likely.
