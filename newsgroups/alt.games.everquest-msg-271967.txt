And the quest is stupid. How is being wiped supposed to be a good
quest ? The reward is great but the only way it can be completed is by
kinda exploiting the system.

When the final sigil thingy is taken the entire zone aggros on you.
The entire zone. You'd be hard pressed just to survive the mob where
the final sigil is let alone 100+ other critters joining in. I doubt
even a huge raid party could survive it. And your hard pressed just to
get a single group together to get in there.

One guy in our group told us how it had to be done. Everyone goes to
the fort and logs out except two people. One guy stays behind where
the final sigil is, the other in the fort. The guy in the fort then
logs out and sends a group message when he's at 10 seconds to go. The
guy at the sigil then runs in, grabs the sigil, gets annihilated just
before the final guy logs out, thereby getting the quest credit.
Everyone then logs back in and the sacrifice guy gets ressed, everyone
gets their reward.

I stayed behind and another guy did too, I guess I didn't really
believe the guy when he said it was a gauranteed wipe. The three of us
went down in about 5 seconds, and that was before the vast majority
of the zone even got to us.

Still, was a great reward. Just wish they'd make it so there was some
way to do it properly.

Cheers,
