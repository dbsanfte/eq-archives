    It would be a waste of server resources. For all the use they see, those
dungeons are effectively instanced. Last night I got to be the only person
in Sol B, for example, at 10:30 PM PST.

    They are quite different. Using the 65 dungeons as an example: easy
dungeons are good for about 1/2 an AA per adventure, assuming you don't muck
around. The item drops are in the 35-50 HP/MANA range. Augments have 6 to a
stat, or 12 HP/MANA. You get 51 points for a win. Hard dungeons are good for
almost a full AA per adventure. The item drops are in the 85 HP/MANA range.
Augments have 7 to a stat, or 14 HP/MANA. You get 105 points for a win. If
I'm in a group capable of doing Hard, I ask for it because the rewards are
much higher. The only thing similar about the two is the point rewards, but
that's just one part of what you can take from them.
