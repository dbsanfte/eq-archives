All mobs, the world over, drop variable amounts of loot.  Yes, the higher
level ones drop a higher max, and a higher average, but you are always
going to see the occaisional "welfare giant" dropping 7 copper when the
last one you killed dropped 30 pp.

If you want to make a loot judgement call you should kill at least four...
and that is just for cash.  Not one in ten will drop an item, and not one
in a hundred will drop their rare item thats worth more than the total
cash and cash value of all the stuff that dropped off the other 99 combined.

Unfortunately, I don't have an answer for the original poster's question.
I can think of mobs that fit his parameters... but I don't know his level,
so I have no idea which ones to list.  He didn't ask for mobs -he- can
kill now anyway, he wants a list of all the "phat lewt" mobs out there,
across all levels, which is sensible, after all he's not going to be just
(whatever level he is now) forever.
