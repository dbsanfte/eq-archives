Con messages appear to tell you this, but in fact they are relaying an entirely
different bit of information; what level the mob is relative to the person
conning.  Just as "role players" will sometimes refuse to come right out and
tell you their class or level, the game dissemulates about what kind of
information it is conveying with a con check.

At level one, you may have serious difficulty killing a white con (level one)
mob at first... but if you max out your skills and manage to loot a rusty
weapon you are good with, you might find the same mob cake.

As you level further, your class, which spells you have, how well equipped you
are and how skilled you are and even how skilled a player you are and which
tactics you are trying will begin to heavily influence what level mob you can
kill; but the game doesn't take this into account at all when giving you the
con message, all its really doing is hinting at mob level relative to your own.

People say the message lies, but it doesn't really, because it never really
changes; red is more than two levels over you, yellow is the next two, white is
your level, blue is several levels under you (how many levels are in this range
changes) and light blue is a couple levels under that, then the rest are
green.  What changes is the power level of a mob of, lets say your level.  As
you level up, a white con mob tends to get more difficult relative to you.
What you can do as a matter of course in the lowest levels becomes harder and
harder, and perhaps (depending on those factors I mentioned above) even
impossible.

But its worse than that.  Because the level of a mob tells you nothing about
its actual HP total, AC, resists, melee damage, melee speed, spell casting
ability, whether it will run, how aggressive it is or how social it is.  Its no
more than a guess at the above; identical named mobs tend to have better in
most of the above categories the higher level they are in a given zone.  But
two different sorts of mobs, well thats another issue.  For example in many
zones a snake is a nice low level easily killed mob, but a spiderling of the
same level may be unkillable because it regenerates damage, perhaps faster than
you can -do- damage.  Yet if you have the means to do a sizable amount of
damage quickly (say with a nuke rather than gradually with a sword) it may have
fewer HP than the snakes, and so be the "easy" target for you.

Experience and your own judgement are really the only ways to find this stuff
out for sure, although there are web resources that can help out with some
basic information about some mobs; that information tends not to be tailored to
your specific abilities.
