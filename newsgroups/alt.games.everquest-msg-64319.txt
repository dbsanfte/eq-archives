Has anybody been able to do anything in the new zones?  I started a new
Beastlord, but the fram rate seemed to be about 3fps in the city, and
remained the same when I got to Shadeweaver's Thicket.  I went back to my
normal character in the old world and everything was fine.  Well almost
everything, now it takes about 5 times as long to zone, and it even locked
up the last time I zoned.  I've been playing EQ since April, and this is the
first time it locked up on me during the game.
