  Error 1018: you know it, you hate it.  I'm sure
just about every EQ player has experienced it at
one time or another; you go linkdead or suddenly
crash to the server select screen, and when you try
to reenter, you're told you already have an active
character on that server, please wait a minute for
synchronization, yadda yadda.

  Night before last I crashed to the server select screen
while zoning from Bazaar to Nexus, and two hours later
I was still being told I had an active character.  Luckily
I already had my vendor in the game on the other computer
and was able to petition for a world boot (the petition was
early on during the two hour span, but hey, I know GM's
are busy folk..)

  Anyway, happened to me again tonight, this time with no
zoning involved.  In Surefall Glade, exit vendor window, spin
180 degrees, take two steps forward... whamo.  Server select
screen.  Error 1018.  Take deep breath and wonder how long
it's going to be this go around.

  I went in to the chat room, where there was already a multitude
of brainiacs bitching about 1018 - and admist the babbling I saw
someone claim that the room GM from last night had stated that
this long 1018 nonsense was not in fact a bug, that it was an intended
fix for some exploit involving /q (/quit) that was killing players and
turning
them into overpowered killer NPCs. (paraphrased)

  I'm not usually one to fall for conspiracy theories, but the truth is
that this crap, at least in my experience, was never this bad before
the last week or so, or more specifically the April 14 patch.

  So... anyone know any details on this supposed exploit and
supposed fix?  Anyone believe it's anything more than shoddy
care of the game by SoE?  Anyone want to chime in and claim
they've had no connection troubles at all during the last week? :)
