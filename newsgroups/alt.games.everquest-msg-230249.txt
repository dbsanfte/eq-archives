Besides, any halflings and gnomes need to be killed at all possible
opportunities.  They are evil, but taste good.

Personally I like to cook roast halfling leg the following way:

Debone the leg
open the roast and spread the following on the inside:

1 cup plain yogurt
1/2 cup chopped mint
1/2 cup chopped cilantro
4-6 cloves of garlic, chopped.

close and tie the roast.

Season the outside with salt and pepper.

Roast at 350 degrees until interior temp is 130.

Let rest 10-15minutes after removing from oven.  Interior temp will
climb approx. 10degrees while it rests.  Halfling is best served
medium rare.


Slice thin and serve on pita with harissa or tadziki.

Bon appetit!

(If halfling is hard to come by, gnome is equally tasty.  Stay away
from dwarf meat, however, it has a strong, unpleasant taste.  This is
likely an artifact of their refusal to wash.)
