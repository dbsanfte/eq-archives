I used to play a mage along with a husband and wife warrior/cleric team, 
and we did LDoN's exclusively from about 30 to 60.  As the core group, 
we had a list of people who we'd gladly add, and we'd take new people 
who were LFG and give them a chance, adding them to the list if things 
went well.  If we had help we'd do hards, but if not we'd do normal and 
never had a problem, in fact as we neared one of those LDoN boundary 
levels we could do hards even though we clearly lacked key elements like 
crowd control, haste, and slow.  The key was being pathologically 
careful about pulling, I was constantly scouting ahead with the eye, the 
warrior would poke his head in and spot while the cleric would stand 
back a little and lull.

The "core team" idea, getting a compatible subgroup, is I think a great 
approach to EQ, if your core can play on its own then you never lack for 
something to do, but at the same time its relatively easy to recruit 
people to form a larger group to do even more interesting things.  I 
tend to make sure I can solo decently, which I guess is my way of making 
my own small group core, but I don't find that the "an army of one" 
concept really helps me form groups, quite the opposite, I'm generally 
not disposed to bother, even though I know I actually enjoy grouping 
more than soloing.

The "List" concept was also a great approach, as we went along we picked 
up more and more people who met our criteria of reasonably competant and 
fun to play with...and who played at the same times we did.    Sadly, 
differing leveling speeds meant some of those people fell off the list 
simply by becoming too low level, and others jumped off the list by 
leveling too fast for us, but by and large the idea worked pretty well.

I'm thinking, in todays low population EQ, that I should really look 
into reviving that approach rather than my normal "solo with the LFG 
flag on" plan which, to be frank, isn't really getting me many groups at 
all.
