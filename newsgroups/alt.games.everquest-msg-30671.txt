 They stack. Well, not having an Exe Axe I can't say that for certain.
If the haste on the Exe is Spell Based (a proc) then it will stack. If
it's item haste then they wont stack.

 Item haste and spell/song haste stack with one another. They don't
stack with themselves. Meaning if you have a CoF and a FBSS the haste is
the greater (CoF) of the two. If you have a CoF and an enchanter hastes
you, you have the combined haste.
