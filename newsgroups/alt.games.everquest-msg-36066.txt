I've got problems finding out what to do too. I've searched a zillion
sites to no avail. I hear people say you should max out your skills at 
each level but how do you know what their pt. total is and if they are
or are not maxed ?

I'm only a level 5 shaman so I don't suppose I've messed it up too
much at such a low level. All the creation guides I've read will
only say put your starting points in 1H blunt eg but that's it.

If anyone knows of a more detailed walkthrough for a shaman
starting out, particularly what to do with respect to skill pts and 
training, I'd appreciate it. [ Iksar if that's relevant ].

Thanks
Jim
