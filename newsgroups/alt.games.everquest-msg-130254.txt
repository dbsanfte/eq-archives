You have a whole section of hotkeys you can make, pages of empty spots in
'social'.  5 lines per hotkey, just put /who all 'name of friend'.  put them
on an unused page of your hotkey box, and when you want to check for friends
just goto that page and run your fingers over the 1, 2, 3, etc. keys,
however many buttons you have there, and it'll tell you who is online.
