I pulled that mob out the 'Sebilis hat'...but regardless. Sebilis is 
after all Kunark (and more importantly expansion 1 out like 6), 
mudflation has evidently caught up... but the more recent expansions are 
not remotely as duo-able becuase the mudflated equipment and 'aa 
abilities' etc that would let them duo the bosses don't exist yet.

You mean like virtually the entire old world? has been obsoleted by 
Kunark and Velious... and then those were rendered relatively obsolete 
by Luclin and PoP...:)

No offense, but that *is* the pattern exhibited by every expansion so far...
