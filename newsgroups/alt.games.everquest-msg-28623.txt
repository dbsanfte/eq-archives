i looked on monkly Business for the answear to this one but i couldnt find
it. sometimes while running around with any one of my characters i would
pass a monk who would be in some place like the EC tunnel and it would
appear to me that he was kicking, jumpkicking and punching at air. As if he
didnt need to have a mob to hit and he was doing this to up his skill. i
know FD can be done anytime just like mend. sense heading forage ETC. but i
cant do punches and kicks without a mob to hit. how do they do it?
