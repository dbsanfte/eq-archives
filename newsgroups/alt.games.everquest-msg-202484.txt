Kei nerf is a good thing for the most part..
I see it this way and yes it is only MY opinion:

 With all the twink gear out there now, players are already far more ahead
in levels then most of their skills.

 Kei keep giving them benefits they for the most part dont earn. Additional
Wisdom and Int boosts =deeper mana pools.

Most mobs in zones are on a spawn/repop table timer. So allowing the rapid
killing of these mobs add to the already stressful camp/mob issues.

 Keeping spells to the current level range of classes whom can use them
correctly is much like the level restrictions placed on some of the items
within the game.

 I understand it does take away from some players ability to take on more
reds for exp and loot, but those are not such a bad issue most of the time.
Exp grinding makes you want to group more often then solo and then it helps
you learn and understand other classes skills and weakness, therefore making
you more insightful in groups.

Just my 2cp which I know are not worth a silver :)
