Not really. Only such mods have problems that change the EQUI.xml or
EQUI_Animations.xml. These two are some kind of global files, especially
the EQUI_Animations.xml for all the graphical things. The EQUI.xml
contains a list of the other UI files for certain windows.
Some other things, like the in my opinion very
great spell icons from Thomus King you can use even without changing
anything in some .xml files.
Also, most mod programmers usually update their mods fast when a patch
has broken their mods. And some other tend to give you a simple text
file with all the additional entries for the upper mentioned files.
So, just take a look on which files the patcher is updating and edit the
new ones so that the entries for you mods are back there again. Surely
not in everyone's ability. But therefore the mod programmers update
their mods after patches.
