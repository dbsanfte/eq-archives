I'm an Everquest newbie, although I'm no stranger to RP games.  I
haven't even played the game yet (I'm expecting it to arrive
tomorrow), but in the meantime I've been trying to swot up on classes
and the lingo.  It took me a while to figure out what twinking is all
about.

As a newbie, would I find Allakhazam's premium service useful?  Or
would my general lack of knowledge about the game be a handicap in
using the service effectively?  It sounds like a good buy, either way.
