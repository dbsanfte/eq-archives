	I've seen a few, precious few, people do this, and I have no earthly
idea how. Almost everyone crashes pretty frequently. With all the zone crashes
you'd have to unless you're out in the middle of nowhere and get really
lucky (o1fe was up most of yesterday - Rome was not so lucky, nor Omni).

>Is it possible your machine or connection is not up to the task?

	My machine screams (and, no, I don't overclock). That said, if it
were just me, I'd blame my setup. It's not. It's almost everyone.

	Plus, the login server downtimes are irrevocable evidence that at
least /something/ is messed up in Funcom land. Everyone screaming about lag
all the time kinda points to a much more general problem, as well. If you
look at the packet dumps... well, it ain't pretty.

	It does seem to be related to server congestion in a lot of cases,
so I tend to crash a lot less in the early AM than other times. I still do,
mind you, but not as much. I've also noticed complete computer lockup in
correspondence with how I play a character. My nanotech freezes a lot more
than my fixer. It looks like if you cast, then hit attack, you have a
chance of freezing. My guess is thread lock on a timer, but I just pulled
that from ether.

	3rd person crashes a lot, as well. My best stability comes from
first person, in a window, playing a class that doesn't simultaneously
attack and cast. I go down to crashing once every hour or so (zone server
willing) instead of every 15 to 20 minutes.

	I've bugged all this, natch, which brings up the issue of the
in-game bug reporter crashing the client; extra points for irony.
