This is a question that has caused people to leave my guild and I was
wondering what the generl feeling is on this...

Monk is in a group with BL guildmate.  Monk goes LD in the middle of a pull
and dies.  Other group members do not know where he died.  When monk comes
back from LD land, group tells him they have a necro inc to find his corpse
and a cleric to rez him.  Necro finds corpse and pulls it to safe spot for
rez but cleric is no where to be found.  Monk runs back to group, loots body
taking the exp loss, and finds out that he has been replaced in the group.
When he asks what going on, guild mate asks him how long they were supposed
to wait on him to get back.  Incident takes 45min from LD to this point.
How would you handle it?
