The single best piece of twinkage you can buy for any caster right off the 
bat is a mana preservation item.

You can pick up a black alloy medallion (MP2) for a few hundred plat these 
days(on my server).

It's better than giving you a bigger mana pool, it effectively gives you 
better mana regen (because it takes less time to med back the mana you 
spent casting any spell).
