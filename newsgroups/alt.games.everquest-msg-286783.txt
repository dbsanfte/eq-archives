All SOE services are undergoing maintenance. Everything is currently 
expected to return to normal around 2:30pm pdt. The EQ servers will 
remain unavailable until the overall maintenance is completed. Forum 
access and other services that require login may be available before the 
maintenance is completed, however they will most likely continue to 
experience slow periods due to the heavy traffic. We will keep you 
posted if the complete timeframe is changed. ~ Zatozia (12:53pm pdt)
