Ok, I have a lvl 36 SK who lacks many things, one of which is Dark Prince
Regent armour, which I have lusted after since stumbling over the stats a
few weeks ago. I'm keen on levelling a DE chanter to 16, twinking him with
int gear and getting his smithing up to 250...

Is it worth saving up for major int gear (say 200+) or is there some point
where spending more money on int gear is just silly? <g>

At what point can smithing be made profitable enough to pay for further
advancement, and how much will it cost me to get Kul2 to that point? :)

Hrm please do not tell me how stupid this is, I'm well aware that creating
an alt just to make one suit of armour is so stupid you can carve it.

Cheers,
James
