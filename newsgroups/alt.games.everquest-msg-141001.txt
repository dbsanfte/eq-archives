I'm running an AthlonXP 1900+ and 512MB of PC2100 RAM with a GeForce4 Ti4600. I 
don't have to limit any of the graphics to play it, I also use 2x FSAA which 
can cause slowdown. In the bazaar I must turn clip plane all the way down, but 
other than that I haven't seen any problems. I thought it might run slower than 
when the game is run normally, but I didn't see any change at all.
