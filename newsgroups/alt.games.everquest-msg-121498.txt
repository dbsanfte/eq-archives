The "old name bug" that *I* knew of was that occasionally someone could make
the same name as you on the same server.  Every time that I've come across
it it was caught by level 5 or so (for obvious reasons).   Following the
thread further it DOES sound like it's a character transfer bug, though
what's strange is that Bob plays every day and the 39 ranger is already in
another guild.  It's certainly possible that he got tagged that fast, but
not EXTREMELY likely.

If I find out what happened I'll update you.
