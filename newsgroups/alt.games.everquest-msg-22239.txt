Yes, this is what I meant. I have dodge, dual wield, double attack,  and
parry. I put one point into them at the guild house, then started killing
things. Just by swinging my weapon, everyone of these skills increased. I
also have kick, bash, and taunt, but I have to push a button to use these
skills. Every other one increases on their own as I fight, which, as a
Warrior, seems to be all I do.
