I killed a mob in Skyshrine before (a place thats never ever hunted in, on
prexus) and it dropped a prim/sec item, like 14int 60mana, No Drop, ALL/ALL

So I camped my monk to log my mage on to loot it (he was camped there for
that sole reason)

I'd seen maybe 2 other people in the whole week (thats how deserted it was,
if it was a busy zone I wouldn't expect stuff to stay without somebody
looting), anyway a fuckin' ranger decided to loot my book (seens as it was
an all/all open book, he thought it would "look cool", even though it was
100% wasted on him, but uber for my mage)

If somebody is slaughtering mob after mob and theres a minute on the
corpse.. chances are they aren't going to loot it.. but if you see 1-2
corpses..  more importantly 1-2 corpses and some nice loot on it, stay the
fuck away

Btw the lead GM intervened in that and I got my book back
