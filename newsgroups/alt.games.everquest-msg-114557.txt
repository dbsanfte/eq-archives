Keep in mind that "Trivial" only means you cannot gain skill from it.  Your
chances of success continue to improve by making other things though.

At about 20 skill over Trivial, you have your max success rate, from what I've
experienced.    But even that high, you still have about a 5% chance of
failure that never goes away.   The chance of rolling a 1d20 and coming up 1,
so to speak.
