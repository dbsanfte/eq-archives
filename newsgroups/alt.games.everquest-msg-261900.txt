A prayer?  I often have some trouble getting a group because they
needed a tank and Beastlord "tanks like a wet paper bag" (exact quote
from another player to me)  if the group already have a decent tank, I
usually can come along because I have a pet, which can serve as
disposable tank in case we get trained on and we need to zone fast.
