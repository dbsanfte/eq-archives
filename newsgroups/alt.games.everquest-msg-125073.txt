Yeah I have no doubt.   When we were doing nToV week-in week-out, I was ally
to Zek (well I was also exping daily in SS till it started to bore me too
much)

I've always been kos to tormax (until the past week) but even nonkos to Zek,
the pull was much easier (not that its really that tough anyway)

I get the feeling this applies to somebody else more difficult then RC (hes
not exactly up there with the top mobs)

We went to kill him the weekend, about 17 of us zoned in, 10 of another
guild were there.. its not often we kill only RC (usually its pre-post
TiV/Shei) so our normal RC killing raid is about 35 ppl (which is a nice
comfortable kill)

So we were racing the other guild, and in the time it took me to install
Luclin on my second comp, we were finally at 22 people, the other guild was
at 28 people.. and ANOTHER guild came to race us lol (the second guild is
smaller than us, the third even more so)

Anyway I get jak (my shaman) to umbral, both guilds have more people than us
(29 and 34), and its the least people we've ever fought him with (we had ONE
warrior period, and 1 botted shaman).. my second comp is a laggy ass pos
(celeron 500, tnt 2 graphics card..)

They also didn't say when he was inc (I couldn't pull cuz i had shaman
duties) I was only at half mana when they pulled him, but malo when he was
in the camp (followd instantly by a mages malis, and oos) and he was slowed
with 0 deaths.

Like 1 death overall it was prolly our best ever RC kill heh

But putting that into context with your post... I still dont get it :)
You've used RC as an example... but to me thats wayyyy too much effort and
requirements to kill a mob as weak as RC

I see the reason behind that... but lets say a shaman tags RC with malo (or
maybe a bard tags with OOS and a shaman tries to slow right off)... that
debuffer is more than likely dieing once they have bought him back to camp
(which might not be a problem for you, if a shaman dies rather than a caster
or something.. but we had 1 shaman there, and 1 bard.  Oh and 1 chanter heh)

The way we did it (which would have been faster had I been expecting the
pull, and actually looking at the right screen) the warrior already had agro
when I malod, the mage over-wrote that, then the bard oos'd, so we all had
aggro - but less than the MA.. it bumped my agro down too.. so when i slowed
him I didn't even agro then..

You know we don't even use the MA/arrows to build aggro heh, not on tunare,
or yeli, ntov, anybody really... nobody does anything to the mob till were
all ready - no damage, no taunts etc... not because its never occured to us,
I guess because we feel no need to.    Looking back at old screen shots last
night (2.8gig EQ directory.. time to delete junk i think) our first ever
Tunare was kindof messy (she dropped first try though, so s'all good)

Lallaar  - all L's.. its on general page btw

It was the one with that lame smiley, but I couldn't take it off without
giving it a shameless bump
