Nobody says theres a shortage of stuff to do, but there are dozens of 
raid-mobs.

Sure there is. But a ton of the 'meaningful' content isn't duo-able, or 
doable by anybody in a short timeframe. So you can camp the entrance in 
Zone A, or pull wanderers in Zone B, or sneak into such-n-such a room in 
Zone C, while earning great cash to buy good equipment that drops off 
mobs you will maybe see but never take... as taking out the named/boss 
mobs regularly requires full/or even multiple groups.

e.g. they can take the Gangrenous Scarab, but the Sebilite Protector is 
out of reach, and likely always will be....

  LDoN has (or at least had) the potential to let a trio take on a 
challenging dungeon, *including its boss(es)*, in a reasonable time 
frame, with a chance for a good reward... without being a crowded permacamp.

Yup. it sure will. But it probably won't be that exciting for them by 
then either.

I still think LDoN is great; interesting, hour long, timed events for a 
single group is still very attractive to the 'occasional gamer' moreso 
by far than another batch of raid-encounters would be. But its still a 
shame that trios and duos aren't supported.
