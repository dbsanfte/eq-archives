Is this a good idea???

I am confused about the motivations of this as a stratagy, I find that when our guild fields Tanks with this as a weapon
there are many deaths, but when I use Epic and BoC with Anger III aug int he Boc I maintain agro and the Mob is not all
over the place... 


Stun and toss the mob... then step up to hit them again seems counter intuitive.


where is the Authority on the idea of an Agro List?
