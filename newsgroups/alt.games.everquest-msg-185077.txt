Plane of Knowledge is, itself, safe from all hazards except those you create
for yourself.  I wouldn't be attacking the guards with your level 1 newbie.
I don't know if there are any faction issues that make if dangerous for
certain categories of characters.

Last I heard, the cheapest horse is around 9500p.  I've had as much as 93p,
so it will be a while before I'm considering riding.  Needless to say, I
haven't really investigated further.

Cheers,
Eric
