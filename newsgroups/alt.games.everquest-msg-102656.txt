The Hornets in Burning Woods are great Exp low hit points for their level,
won't run from you so no need to snare except when you need to escape. With
good pulling never any adds, I have done close to 40 levels on different
characters there and only 1 Wanderer ever showed up. Unlimited supply of
hornets and very few people there. Stay above the nest in the SW corner of
Burning Woods and pull away Ash Hornets mid 30s Cinder high 30s  Ember low
40s and Scoriae Mid 40s. Loot ok wings sell for around 3p pollen and poison
sacks 5gp some nice gems and level 50 dropped spells.
