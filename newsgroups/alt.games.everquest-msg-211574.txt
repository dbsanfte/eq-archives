The 'occasional gamer' was poised to take advantage of LDoN more than 
anyone else... these are the players that don't have regular guild 
groups they've played with for weeks on end, who don't have the raid 
mentality where they spend 8+ hours at a time "doing what their told" 
for the good of "the guild".

This 'ton of content' you talk about isn't accessible to them anyways.

Hour long events on demand in meaningful single group encounters would 
be something an 'occasional gamer' can sink his teeth into...at least in 
theory.
