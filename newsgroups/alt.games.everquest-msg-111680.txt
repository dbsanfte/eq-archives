Alright folks.....
This is a great, informative newsgroup.
The trolls dont bother me, the rants I rather enjoy, and the threads can be
interesting to see where they go....*however*.....
Will you some of you people get a CLUE as to how to reply to a message?  TRY
DELETING THE IRRELAVENT TEXT.   There is NO reason under the sun that for
people to read your post, we have to scroll thru a 7 mile long post to see
your one line bit of wisdom at the bottom, or, worse yet, inserted someplace
randomly in a post.
