My level 14 druid "twink" just twinked my main with a fistfull of hq
bear skins and a ebonwood cudgel.  They are even.  The Enchanter twink
still owes us some mana vials when he picks up some levels, but The debt
has been re-payed with interest.

OK, I have tremendous admiration for someone who goes to the trouble of
learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
