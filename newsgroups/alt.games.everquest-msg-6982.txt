It's a combination of weapon skill, strength, and offence. The actual
formula is:

ATK=(2.7*Weapon Skill)+(4/3*Offence)+(0.915*[Strength-75])+8

Weird formula, but plug your character's stats in and it will equal
the ATK in the Persona screen. For a melee, one level of maxed skills
will add just over 20 points to your ATK value. 22 points of strength
adds the equivalent ATK value of a full level, making one more
argument in favour of the large races.

However, if you have ever fought in the same zone for multiple levels,
you'll notice there isn't much difference in hit percentage after a
level increase. Fight similar mobs for 5 levels though, and you will
notice a sizeable increase in hit percentage.
