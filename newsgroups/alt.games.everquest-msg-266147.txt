I hated the frogloks, but then I don't like it when people replace
"you" with "thou" or "thee" and think that makes them sound archaic.
It just sounds stupid.  I also hate the way they pronounce "Froak".

I'm seriously considering roleplaying a high elf who snaps because of
the frogloks and goes off to Freeport to plan his vengeance.
