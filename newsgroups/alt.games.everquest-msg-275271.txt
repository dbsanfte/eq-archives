And just to make things more complex:

http://www.publications.ojd.state.or.us/A101975.htm

The same store involved in the dispute 10 years ago was deemed
NOT to be a public place in a more recent decision.

Things that folks not from Oregon may not know is that, for 
a very long time Fred Meyer stores also had a number of shops
(and some still do) renting space in their building.  Some
of the older stores, particularly downtown stores like Hawthorne
and Stadium, were remodeled to eliminate hardlines and they
took over the space formerly occupied by tenants.

My assertion that this is a vastly more complex subject than
the simple black and white posturing of some of the NG folks
is born out by the fact that our own Oregon Supreme Court can't
come to a majority opinion on this.

And Sanjian - if you read that you'll see exactly where in
the Oregon Constitution the derived the right of petitioners
to use private property.

Keep in mind that the Constitution (Federal or State) only 
serves as the basis for our laws and that its interpretation
by the courts is what legal decisions are actually based on.
