	Yes, it's so sad...  I went to crushbone last week and there
were only 2 people in the zone, two level 8 dwarfs.  And they *owned*
the place, I mean, out back killing the slavers and the thaumaturge...

	A "real" untwinked new player would be very lonely unless his
friends made alts to play with him.  

	OTOH D'Vinn's finally getting what's coming to him...
