 If you're a class that gets sneak, such a monk, you can still do these
quests. Which is probably another reason to pick a faction different
than Dwarves since that way you can do both. I know people KoS in
Thurgadin who have their 9th ring. I've heard of other KoS people
finishing the 10th as well. Generally speaking though you're right. 

 Not only that, but you can still kill Tormax if you want. It would only
take one Dain kill to fix it. You can work both factions if you pay
attention to what you're doing. You could probably manage all three but
that'd probably be a bit much.
