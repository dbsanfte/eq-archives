Thanks for the info.

Here's some info for you... check out the new Celeron Tualtin 1.2ghz upgrade
at www.powerleap.com.  It works for a lot of older mobos.


I just upgraded from a 700mhz P3 coppermine to the Tualatin and the
difference is quite noticeable.  I can post benchmarks and/or more links if
you need more info.
