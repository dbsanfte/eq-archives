In "EQ as it is" there is no reason for you to not do so.  I have two
accounts, and have played around some with 2-boxing (on one machine).
I don't like it.  Not because it's difficult (it's not), not because
it doesn't work well (what I've tried has all worked great), but because
it's a decidedly anti-social approach to a game designed to be social.
In my "ideal game" scripted 'bots would not exist and player directed
'bots would be far less effective than the same character with a
dedicated player at the controls.

I was ambivalent about 'botting until I saw some yutz running 6
characters with scripts on Stromm.  I was able to defeat a near
overwhelming urge to engage in some serious griefing only by
leaving the zone.  I'm still disgusted by it.

Frankly, I suspect that your 'bots are more effective than many "mains",
even discounting for whatever high-end table scraps they're wearing.

"key classes" should not exist, at least not in the way they do in
EQ, but that's another rant entirely.

Always a pleasure  ;)

> for me)


I have never been a fan of the absurdly huge disparity in soloing
ability of EQ's character classes.  If it had been possible for
you to have fun and make noticeable progress while playing Meemers
solo would you have been attracted to 'botting in the first place?
If it was possible to xp and quest solo at a pace that was slower
than a good group but faster than an idiot group, so that grouping
and raiding were not "required" except to go after special loot,
would you have become so determined to become a "one-man group"?

Please remember that I started off by saying "It's too late for EQ".
Some of the things that would hurt the effectiveness of 'bots
(especially scripted 'bots) would cause a huge uproar if SOE were to
put them into EQ now.
