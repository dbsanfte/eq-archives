If you're a real newbie you probably shouldn't start out on a PVP
server (any server that has "Zek" as part of its name), but should
start out on a non-PVP server (or "blue" server) so you get a feel of
the game without having to worry about being killed by other players.
If I were you I'd just start up a new character on a blue server (but
keep your PVP characters in case you do decide you want to play there
again).
