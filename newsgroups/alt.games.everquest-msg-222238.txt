That's what happened when my friend got banned :|

SoE customer support never even told him anything, and when he 
emailed/phone they told him he was banned. When he asked why they 
emailed him the License Agreement. When he responded asking for more 
info about why he'd been banned, they ignored it.

Eventually it came out that his account had been involved in stripping a 
3rd parties account. Now I know my friend didn't do it... which means he 
got hacked somehow... you'd think SoE could have figured it 
out...checking what ip it was logged in from... but no nothing.

Its pathetic really... he was away for the weekend camping; and he 
didn't even know the victim. You'd think SoE would have at least tried 
to discuss the situation, hear his side of the story at least... but 
nope they just cancelled it.

His only real fault was having a password that would have been easy to 
guess if you spent anytime with him... :(

He plays Shadowbane now. I don't blame him.

I truly hope in your case its just your caps lock is on.
