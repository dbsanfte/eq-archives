No, the one with the most played time.  Someone created a lvl 1 toon 6
months ago just for bazaar mule and been on 24/7 (over 4000 hours)
could retain name even if another with same name created 5 years ago,
played around and knows a lot of people but been on maybe 1 hour a day
(less than 2000 hours).

I know it doesn't seems fair but that's how SoE decided.  I have
checked the server I'm merging into and a couple of my toons have the
same name.  My main's is among them but I can't get a hold of other
(never on, no reply to emails) so I have no way of knowing which one
of us will keep the name.  If I lose mine, I hope that other won't
mind getting about 20-30 tells the minute he logs on as it's one
disadvantage of being a guild officer.
