A substantial part of the damage a shaman would do in an extended melee
like going against a dragon comes from the pet. AoE would zorch the pet
rather quickly. Plus, in order to resist it himself, the shaman would have
to sacrifice some ac/hp gear to wear resist stuff, which would make him
more susceptible to the melee damage from the dragon. Also, all WW dragons
do a single-slot debuff when they do their AoE damage...while an epic
shaman has the black fur boots to instantly re-buff the slot, it is a giant
pain in the neck, and the dispel sometimes hits buffs other than the top
one.

Well, 6 people can plow through a dragon a heck of a lot faster, so there
are nowhere near as many of those AoEs to worry about. Plus with the
additional player horsepower, you can throw on some resist junk and take
less from the AoEs that DO get out.
