And you're just being an ass.

Look, I understand a lot about business and different business models.

One business model says charge for everything.  This is the tact that
Direct TV took originally.  They charged almost $700 for the equipment.

As Direct TV discovered, this isn't necessarily the best business
model as evidenced by the fact that you can now get the equipment for
$99.

The money is made on the service.

A lot of companies have moved to a service-oriented model.

I have no issue with Everquest doing this.  I just believe they
should also take the tact on the front end by either (a) charging
less for the expansions or (b) giving the expansions away.

Now, as for me knowing nothing about busines-EIVd you being an
ass, I suggest that this be the end of that.
