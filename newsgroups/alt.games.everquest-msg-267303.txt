Yes, you need two seperate ID #'s, honestly it's not worth it.

Collectors edition includes a few extra's but mostly not worth mentioning,
the dragon pet is part of it, it is given to you for use in your house you
rent, it's a very useless ornament, heaven help you if your house and all
it's contents are lost and not replaced as such was my case in beta.

SOE will probably give you a typical responce like, sorry but once it's gone
it's gone, you cannot hold us responsible because you didn't pay your rent
or someone else took everything from your house you gave access to, or we
had a bug in the server and everyone else has the same problem so just deal
with it.

Honestly the CE including the dragon is not worth it, in fact EQ1 or 2 is
not worth paying to play, unless you have lot's of cash and really don't
care what you spend it on, it's all just another thing to waste it on.

What ever you decide, don't say I didn't warn you of the waste of time and
money.

And now a word from our dedicated arse kissing EQ fans which I'm sure will
follow this message.

lol
