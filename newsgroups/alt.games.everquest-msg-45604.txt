The GFX card is always cold when I open up the case.. I have a fan hitting
the card from about an inch away
the CPU, when I have it set to 1050Mhz is only 129F, I usually keep it there
because I dont need the rest of the speed too much and I already try to keep
the heat low. Other than that, the rest of the system temp is reading 90F
