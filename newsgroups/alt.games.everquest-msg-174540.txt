They are casters NPC's. Chances are your fire/cold/Magic resists are still
pretty low and thats why they creamed you, If you had higher resist gear you
would have creamed them

Sound like a treant, If you conned it it should say something like
Indiferent, Dubious, scowls etc etc. Kindly, warmly, amiably, indifferent,
and dubious conned mobs will not attack you, threatening and scowls will
attack you, From what i remember treants will only attack you if they see
you attacking an animal.
