The extra HP will be noticable by level 30 whether you are playing your way
up or 'being PLed as a guild tank'. He came here asking for advice on how to
distribute points on an ogre warrior and was advised to go with STA by 2
level 60 warriors (and others) and AGI/STR by various other people. Either
way I guess he has enough opinions for him to make an informed decision.
