Actually that would not have been considered uber by any standard
kunark or later even for a lowbie. Certainly by Luclin it was
outclassed by pretty much everything. :-)

So true! Though LDoN is part of the problem.

Actually, that's not quite accurate; its actually a symptom.

The real core of the problem was that the mudflation hit the roof, and
SOE has not done much to raise the roof. The roof was character
abilities. That includes both stats and spells, aa and discs. Rather
than raise the roof, SOE got lazy and just started putting hp on
everything. This is the *direct* and most disastrous source of the
mudflation and the class balance problems that follow it.

EQ would have been a ten times better game if instead of raw hp on
every item they had raised the max stat level more, and then balanced
encounters with that in mind.

It's too late though. You'll have to wait for the next game now, for,
in the sense that you and I mean, EQ is irrevocably broken.

Shoulda come back to FV. My paladin and druid are mid30s now and they
have stayed mostly in oldworld zones for nostalgia sakes. I did do
14-20 in Paludal before going to SolA, and one level at the needlites
(and oh yeah did one ldon), other than that I've been in velious or
earlier (my favorite era of EQ).
