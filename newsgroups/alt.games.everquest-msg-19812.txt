You do.

But, if you have space and can carry the weight, keep the tome with you.
That'll save you a run to the bank once your melee skill(s) are capped for a
particular level. It's also handy in groups, when you won't want to melee
really at all. In a situation like that, the extra INT and mana will come in
handy.
