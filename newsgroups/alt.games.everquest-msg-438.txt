I've got a K6-2 500, and this has only happened to me twice, all on the same
day. The friend that I play with very regularly, however, has a P-III (600
or 700 I think), and this happens to her all the time. I'd like to join jaZZ
in asking for any other information. For what it's worth, we play on Tunare.

Thanks,

Moradin
