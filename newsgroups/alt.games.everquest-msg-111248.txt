Well.. there IS the DKP system, and it's many variations.  Still, even 
THAT is intended to do what you describe above - rewards those who put in 
the most time.  Only difference is they've made it a quantifiable system 
so that no one can have the chance to claim favoritism (or even develope 
the idea that it may exist).

/random for loot in guild is bad, assuming you are in a guild that does 
things together with any semblance of frequency.
