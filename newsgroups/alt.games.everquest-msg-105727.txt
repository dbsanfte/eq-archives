That IS confusing.  So...what is he saying?  That your weapons are speeded
up, not by 40% but rather by an amount which would cause your weapons to
output 40% more damage?  If that's what he's saying, he sure could have
worded that better...I really have to squint to see that meaning in there.
I took his words to mean that the number of times you swing in a given
period is not increased, but that overall damage is increased 40%.
