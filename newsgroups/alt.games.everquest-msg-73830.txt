I guess the real question is whether or not you are interested in reading
the books now - whether watching the film created so many questions in your
mind that you feel compelled to go pick up the book and dive into it - or if
you're okay with just catching it all on film.  Just curious.

Its been many years since I've read them but I remember them being so
immersing and thorough, I was hooked from the get go.  Seeing the movie has
only made me realize that I need to dig up my copies and give them a read
again.  As usual, the book is always better than the movies and watching the
film left me laughing at myself in some parts as I tried to rationalize what
was going on to the "bastardization" of all this in EQ (don't get me wrong,
I love playing EQ its just not LotR (and in its defence never aspired to be
so)) before slapping myself on the side of the head for my stupidity.

Anyway, I do kind of laugh at your post - not in spite; just how I
interpreted it.  For the respect that Tolkien deserves (even if you are not
a fan, you have to respect what he created), your comments are somewhat
curious. They have a sort of "not sure what all the fuss was about, seems
"neat" and all but what were they thinking when they did ..." tone to them
which I interpret as a bit of a discredit to the whole body of Tolkien
works.  Even in a three hour movie, its impossible to really capture the
essence of the world he created, although the movie tried and got it is good
as it could given the medium (so for that they get two thumbs up).

Anyway, just some comments on the top of my mind today.  Take 'em for what
they're worth. :)
