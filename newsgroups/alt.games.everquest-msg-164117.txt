I was wondering if there were any guilds on MM that were primarily
Skandinavian (or something else close to that time zone). I have recently
found myself relocated to this land of snow and ice.

My highest level character is a 48 warrior. She's been guildless since the
collapse of the Sabretooth Bear Clan (and a big HUZZAH to those that were
SBC).

Any help is appreciated.
