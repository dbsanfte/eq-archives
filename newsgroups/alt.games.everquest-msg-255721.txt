Hmm... I may be a master tinkerer, but I still haven't found the recipe 
for this 'microchip' of which you speak.  Does it have something to do 
with the micro servos that drop in Steamfont?

Umm... LoY?  I'm sure there's theoretically some sort of a raid target 
there... But when's the last time you saw a raid headed there?

Not that I see what that's supposed to prove.

Here, we agree.

Ah yes, those were the days.  Well, not bleed, but I've definitely managed 
to callous a thumb or two. :)  Back in the day when about the uberest 
secondary slot an Enchanter could reasonably hope for was Stein of Moggok, 
from a soloable quest, or Glowing Black Stone, off a level 13 mob...

Of course, the world only had two real raid targets then, and Befallen was 
the only keyed/flagged zone. :)
