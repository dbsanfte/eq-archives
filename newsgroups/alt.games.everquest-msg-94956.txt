While kneeling at the altar of the alt.* hierarchy, Eqnutts pleaded:

Nope, person was too far for me to get an easy click on to see their
health or the name.

Heh heh. Yeah, I suppose that makes sense.

Yeah, seen people like that. Sad really.

Except for the fact that I get easily lost I might just have done
that. I'm out in Everfrost and where my character might have Sense
Direction (70) I personally have it at level 2 ;p

Not callous, just the truth. I helped a warrior find his corpse, and I
died, twice. Ugh.

Thanks for the input.
