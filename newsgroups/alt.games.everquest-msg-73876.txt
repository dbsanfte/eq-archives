65pp is a hell of a lot of money at 11, and other issues like magic
boots or weapons may well be more important; sure haste and resists
aren't (yet) but being able to whack away on wisps or get a tasty
toy like an axe of the ironback may well improve combat efficiency
more... Its amazing what us highlevels have caused to filter down
to the low levels now. Some of the toys cheaply available are almost
obscene in their ratios.

I remember at 11 (or a few levels earlier perhaps) being delighted
at having 16pp to spend on leather armour with my tarnished - not rusty,
*tarnished!* - 2hs sword then travelling all the way to faydwer to purchase
the awesome 2hs fine steel swords being sold for 15 - fifteen! when a shop
bought longsword would cost as much! - pp ;)

Sui, just making conversation now ;)
