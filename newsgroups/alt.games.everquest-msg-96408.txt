> Female half-elfs are the babes of Norrath, in my humble opinion.

Egads, how can you say that? My female half-elf has such bad posture she
looks like that unpopular girl in high school that always shuffled down
the hall like an orangutan (sp?)!  For Karana sake girl, you are a hero,
stand up straight!!

Oh, and she has a flat butt :(  But maybe I pay too much attention to the
details.
