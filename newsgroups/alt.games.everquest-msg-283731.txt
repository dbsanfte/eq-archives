Don't even have to work that hard now, just look at the map, the X's 
mark your groupmate's positions.  I'm torn between how handy this is and 
how it really takes even more of the challenge away, how would my 
character know this stuff, radar?  GPS in everyone's cellphones?

See invis, now thats a clearcut magical spell.

But its not very useful.
