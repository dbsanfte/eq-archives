I'm surprised to read that they switched permanently.  I created a new
character on Stromm because in many ways it reminds me of what it was
like in the beginning of EQ...back in the day when a Fine Steel Long
Sword was a good item for a newbie.  Back in the day when level 10
bards were not running around in Lambent Armor.  There are items on
this server that will be harder to come by unlike some of the other
established servers.  For the time beign there's no..., "Oh, I want a
Centi Long Sword...let's see how many are for sale in the Bazaar."

Of course, that will all change over time and the value of items will
eventually drop.  Regardless, it will be fun for a little while.
