	Under the right circumstances, bows can be useful for Rangers over 50 when
you get double damage against engaged targets.  The problem is that they're
not as useful as they should be, and the circumstances are too narrow.

	We did Lhranc yesterday and with a Huntsman, shadow arrows and Trueshot I
was landing 200-point shots on him.  Of course, half my shots were wasted
because people kept walking into the line of fire.  (And he only lasted 59
seconds anyway...he had been billed as this great unstoppable thing that we
had to be prepared to zerg-rush, and he went down like a two-dollar whore.)
