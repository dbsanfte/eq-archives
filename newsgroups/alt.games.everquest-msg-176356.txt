Ask on any of the class-specific boards for classes which have to know aggro
management. sk.org might be a good place to start, as aggro control is
currently one of the main roles - we've even got two spell lines that do
nothing except increase aggro (and a few spells that completely ditch it)

Current accepted theory goes like: A successful taunt moves you to the top
of the hate list with aggro equal to the person previously on top +1. Of
course, after that taunt things like proximity, health levels , dots/DD and
so on can and will change who the mob is aggroed on, which is why repeatedly
mashing the taunt button keeps the mobs attention - the MT isn't slowly
increasing his aggro, he's simply attempting to maintain his position at the
top of the hate list.

And don't expect a citatin from SOE about this, they're paranoid about the
actual mechanics of EQ.
