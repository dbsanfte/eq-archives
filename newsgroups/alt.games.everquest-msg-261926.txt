The best strategy will vary depending on raid targets.  For some spot heals 
and a CHeal rotation, for others spam fast heals, sometimes lots of group 
heals are needed along with MGBing heal to the raid.  For some, specific 
types of cures will be required.  It's impossible to generalize and say 
this is how you successfully raid, it has to be done based on the target.
