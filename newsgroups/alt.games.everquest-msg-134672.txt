Its funny listening to people complain about how they are getting screwed by
Verant because they cant play. :)
Hell, I love this game too, but my patch screen says more than 72 hours to
go.Guess my connection is bad this side of the world.
I'll just leave it running and do something else, I have a good book to
finish.
I know that in about a weeks time I will be thanking Verant for such a great
patch.
Chill out guys/gals and enjoy yourselves.
