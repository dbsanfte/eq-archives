In reading through this thread, I have noted some omissions on some
excellent options, either due to lack of knowledge, or, lack of racial
knowledge.

My currently 21 Barbarian Warrior is wearing the following, and has an
ac of well over 450... draw your own conclusions.

Bronze Helm (10pp from PC in Halas)
Bronze Mask (8pp from same PC)
2 +2str/+1ac earings (free - no more than 2-3pp per)
banded collar (standard 2pp/ac)
Polar Bear Cloak (nice low level Everfrost quest, 5pp plus 1 polar
bear skin, and time to find Karg Icebear - 10ac, 5sv cold)
Giant Woven Vest - this is the most expensive piece I wear.  I have
seen it for auction in EC for as high as 1k... I got mine for 50pp off
a lvl44 gnome.  A lot of late night auctions are like this - people
that want to dump and run. (ac18, +20str, +10 on 2-3 different stats)
And as a benefit, there is not a lot of competition for it, because
only 3 races can wear it - Barbarian, Troll and Ogre.  And most of the
Trolls and Ogres I have seen in EC are high enough to get their own
armor (lvl's 40 and up)
Bronze Girdle (5pp off of a PC who just bought full set of crafted)
Crafted Sleeves (quested for)
Banded Legs
Kobold Hide Boots (number of +stats, including STR, and most
important, magic... only 5ac, but being able to kick magic beings at
master level makes it worth it - 30pp at EC tunnel).
And Banded Gloves.

Lots of room for improvement, but nothing is critically short.  

You do not need to spend lots of money to get ahead.  Go to EC.  Watch
the auction screen.  Especially late at night, when most people are in
the process of logging.  I have about 400pp in this entire setup, with
the only piece being over 100pp being the Crafted Sleeves.  Is it
worth it?  Well, soloing crocs from 16 to 21 in 4 days, at less than
an hour a day, with only one death (so I screwed up and targetted
Lockjaw... definately my bad) with very little actual downtime per
hour... more than worth it.  Orc Highway is no challange to survive,
unless trained by more than 2-3 at a time.  Only real weakness at this
time is weapon selection, having nothing better than a Crystal Fibre
and a Serated Blade.  On the upside, despite their low damage, they
are both sub-30 delay, and were both had for under 100pp.

Personally, in spite of it's higher AC and relative low cost, I would
avoid going completely bronze,  The weight is too prohibitive, even
with the Barbarians higher str.
