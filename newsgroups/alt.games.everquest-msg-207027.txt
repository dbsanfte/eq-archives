Did a Veeshans Peak clearing recently, using monk/wizard.

I would move the monk up, move the raid up (to engage a mob), and then move
the wizard up.  For some bizare reason, at least 10 times when I moved the
wizard up, he'd get summoned, even tho I never cast shit, and people were
actively fighting the mob
