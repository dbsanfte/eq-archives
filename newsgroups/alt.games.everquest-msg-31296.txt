The real question is what race are you and what is your strength.  My
experience is that Bronze for most of the eleven race and a good many humans
weighs simply too much, and unless you enjoy constant runs to cities to
sell, bank and buy food you might want to avoid it.  Fine plate on the other
hand is a reasonable solution to most problems.  What I would do is buy a FP
BP and legs, a SSB which you can get fairly cheaply now for a helmet, any
kind of magical boot I could find, you need that to make kick effective
against magical creatures, and fill the rest of you armor slots with magical
pieces as you have funds and they become available.  Eventually you will
have to replace the BP and legs but by then you should have enough pp to
begin upgrading to crafted or better.

By all mean though up grade your AC.  The biggest mistake most young melee
types make is to buy some powerful melee weapon before they get good armor
and then find that while they are doing tremendous damage to the mob with
each hit the mob is doing even more damage to them between the hits they
make with their generally slow but powerful weapon.  This is especially true
with something like the Executioners axe which does not proc haste until
around lvl 30 and which in the meantime gives the mobs plenty of time to
destroy you in-between you slow but powerful blows.  Also be sure to keep
all you weapon skill up including duel wield as fast and not so powerful
weapons are often more effective than the slower two hander ones.
