Aye, the only class I can think of that consistently and reliably gets
groups just by turning on LFG is the Cleric.  And even for them it's
not an intantaneous thing, at times they have to wait just like the
undesirables.  I know that to group my Druid usually takes around half
an hour and I often have to make the group myself, it definitely helps
that I can gather people from wherever they might be hanging out.  As
for the poster who said "NOBODY wants a druid", that's bullshit.  And
the characters that most often seem to want a Druid are Clerics who
don't want to be buffing constantly, Shaman who figure they're busy
enough already without having to heal, MTs who don't trust the puller,
any group desperate enough to head to "[someplace], because [so-and-so]
says it's great xp", and most anybody in my guild.
