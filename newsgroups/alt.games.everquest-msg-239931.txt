By making reinforced acrylia, almost all ingredients are sold in bazaar,
used to be quite cheaply but the flawless price has gone way up. The tannin
is cheap and can be made using ingredients sold in shar vahl i believe,
although i always get it from PoK. Studded acrylia was good for a lot of it
too; at one time the masks sold for quite a bit, but most people sell them
to the npc's now.

At the moment, if you can fight in miragul's menagerie, the lemming fur
recipes will see you to 176 and the backpacks sell very well. Just need to
be able to forage.
