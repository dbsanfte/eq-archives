They are only bad in comparison to 60, because that was the super short "max
level" level.

As someone who did level 59 before the "exp smoothing" (that one level took
almost a month.  One blue was a good day of exp'ing)  61 to 65 is nothing.
I think I worked it out that each level was about 5 AA's long.    Heh...
just think, for 20 AA's you could buy one GoD Ability instead.


I worked out how many AA's long the "new" level 59 was as my rogue passed
it, but I forget it at the moment ; )  It's still the longest level to date.
