I was twinked :-) However I've made some mistakes on my first char
(ranger) and I want to get the things off one char and on to the
other. Is it a problem for those that can teleport (or what ever it's
called) to go from landmass to landmass? In this case from Qeynos to
Kelethin. What would be the best way to handle this?
