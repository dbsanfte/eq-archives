The Overthere is pretty flat.  What are you doing when you kite that
requires more flatness than The Overthere?

I recommended getting comfortable with non-flat zones.  Someday, you'll want
to hunt in places like Emerald Jungle, Burning Woods, Skyfire, Trakanon's
Teeth, Great Divide, Wakening Lands, Cobalt Scar, Rathe Mountains, just to
name a few, and an aversion to bumpy zones will limit you.

Try levitating.  That takes much of the sting out of non-flat zones.  Bat
wings are cheap (a stack is around 26 silver from the merchant in EC near
the WC zone, unlimited supply).
