Hmm what drivers are you using? Is EAX working? Music?

I have a friend who was playing EQ under Win2k using an Audigy with the 
latest Creative drivers as of about a month ago, and he could not hear 
anything unless he turned the sound acceleration to "software 
emulation", which sounded worse than really bad short-wave radio! He 
uses WinME now and the sound for the most part is good, save for a few 
glitches in the music every now and then.
