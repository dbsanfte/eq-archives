I did say "other very desirable effects"; I didn't mean damage
delay ratio by that.  Apparantly some melee weapons have high
attack bonus or something that make them very desirable as
offhand weapons, not replacable until extreme endgame if ever.

But I don't really know, 99% of what I know about melee comes
from playing a cleric who liked hitting things with a hammer when
his mana bar wasn't doing anything interesting.

My cleric has a 36% haste on his shoulders if I recall correctly,
and his top end raiding ended at killing AOW.

Really must not be hard at all to come by.
