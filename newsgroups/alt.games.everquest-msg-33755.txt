Speaking of batwings :-) I always carry 2 or 3 stacks on my druid. Yesterday
I just ported into Feerott and someone /ooc'ed WTB stack of bat wings,
paying 50pp per stack. WOOT :) This is REALLY a nice price, to say the least
:) I quickly send a tell, guy comes to druid ring and gave me 100pp for 2
stacks. Turns our he's 55 druid. Hehe .. then I  gate to WC, run to the Inn
from EC, buy another 6 stacks of bat wings with 2 gp per stack and send
another tell. Dang! level 55 is offline ...

Anyway, nice money :) I still can't belive a level 55 would not know that he
can buy the bat wings from EC inn.

I know, I should've told him that he can buy them from EC. What can I say, I
am poor :)
