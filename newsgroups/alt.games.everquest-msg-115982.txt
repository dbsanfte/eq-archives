There is ZERO evidence to confirm that your skill in Kick affects the
success of Instill Doubt. 

You must be within melee range when the "kick" part of ID fires off.
The Kick must land in order for the monster to be feared, but no one
has proven conclusively that a higher skill in kick makes ID land more
often.
