Yes.  Once you grok the way the skill point system works, there is heck of a
lot of flexibility for any sized group of people who want to play regularly
to come up with characters that will have their needs covered.

Some duos I've done with a friend that have been a lot of fun:

    Midgard: Healer and Warrior.

        The Healer is Midgard's main healing class, but is also the main
        crowd control class, so this duo has healing, crowd control, and
        tanking covered.

    Albion: Cleric and Sorceror.

        The Albion Cleric is more like an EQ Cleric: healing and buffing are
        what it is good at (although if specialized in Smite, they can fight
        fairly well).  The Sorceror is a crowd controller, and can charm a
        pet, which does the tanking.

There are plenty of others that work.

Not as far as I know, but if the models are being redone, who knows?  It
does have pointy hats, which cause indescribeable joy for many casters. :-)

The biggest thing to watch out for as an EQ player trying DAoC is to not
assume that anything in the way of classes matches.  E.g., if you like EQ
Druids, don't assume DAoC Druids will be similar.

Also, stay away from Necromancers.  Necromancers are ridiculously
overpowered.  The have both lifetaps that work like EQ lifetaps except they
heal the pet rather than the Necro, and they have powertaps, which drain
life from the mob and give back power (the equivalent of EQ mana).  So, a
Necro sends in the pet, and then uses lifetaps and poweraps to easily finish
the fight with the pet at full health and the Necro at full power.  I'm by
no means a fast leveler, and I got my Necro solo to 50 in about 8 days
/played.  People who are good at fast leveling do it in 5.  I did this
because once you get a 50 on your account, you are allowed to start new
characters at 20.  Me and friend figured we'd blast through with Necros to
enable that, and then we could go back to doing what we loved: trying neat
duos.

(The first five levels are very generic in DAoC, so playing them over and
over with different characters gets tedious.  Starting at 20 gets you to the
point where you've got a lot of the interesting spells and skills of the
class).

The problem?  After zooming to 50 with the Necro, everything else seems so
damned slow, I just can't do it.  It's been months, and I've still not
recovered from the breathtaking speed of the Necro, and the feeling of
*power*.  I figure in another few months, I'll maybe be able to play a
non-Necro.
