It's hard to generalize for the tougher mobs. Which one is more
efficient will probably depend on a comparision between your attack
and it's defense. Still, I think you can generalize and say that the
crits are more efficient against the majority of targets, the other
disc is better against high cons.

I tend to be just the opposite with my warrior. Offensive Discs get
used almost as soon as they pop, defensive discs get saved for the
when the group gets into trouble.

Agreed.
