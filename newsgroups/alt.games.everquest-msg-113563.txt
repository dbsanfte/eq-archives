Yes, your spelling is bad.

My spelling and grammar are far better than yours, judging by the two
samples I've responded to in this thread, and I *still* spell-check
anything I'm not absolutely certain of in my text.  (I should
spell-check even more but, along with many other shortcomings, I'm
lazy.)

You say to judge you on what you write and not on your writing skills,
but your writing skills impact on what you write.  Content is
important, but so is the way in which you present it.  Without clear
presentation, even the best content goes to waste.

You say you're a programmer.  How can I trust what you build, when I
can't trust your spelling?  How do I know that you're using the
correct variable for any given line of code, when it's entirely
possible that you are mistyping the name of one variable for another?

A quick example; your second line above, only 13 words long, has 4
errors in it.  (And I'm not counting "u" and "4", as they are
legitimate examples that you're using.)
