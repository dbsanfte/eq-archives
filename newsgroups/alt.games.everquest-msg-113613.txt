Here are a few more unusual ones:

Bottom of Befallen.  The bane of the curious and uneducated lowbie,
Befallen has not one but 3 one way doors, and several spots that will
drop you down a level without necessarily having a key to get out or a
bat's chance in hell of living.  Drop to the bottom that requires no
key to get to is the best of these, of course.  Now you have a body
in a spot where you have no hope of getting to it, its find a high level
person who's willing to help out, or write off all your worldly goods.

Kaesora: a mix of huge hoards of living and undead that aggro even if
green that make getting to a body a real pain, and a one way ledge or two
that prevents dragging out to zone easily.

Kael Drakkar in the arena; there are some See Invis giant guarding the
arena that aren't casual to get past or kill, at least for naked people in
their 50s, which are commonly dead in arena.

Western Wastes/TOV/DN... all mean pushing thru Siren's Grotto,
which is a tricky thing to do on your own.  There is a cheat which
makes this relatively simple, of course, but eventually that will get
fixed.

Kedge Keep and The Grey... zones where you need EB to breath
anywhere in the zone.  Got your own EB item so you are  a happy
camper in there?  Not when you are naked, you don't!  Get a rez
in there and have that funny glitch where it takes forever to loot
your own body and you can drown before you get that EB item
working.

My favorite nasty CR's, though, are the following duo

Plane of Air
Plane of Hate

You need a wizard to get you to these two, and at least a small raid
sized force to get in alive. While  you are usually not there alone... I've
crashed out up there and not been able to get on till long after the
raid is gone.  Also, deaths in Hate sometimes put you up on the second
floor due to a glitch, frequently with a raid force that isn't capable of
getting up there.

While the others all are easily countered by a necro ( a quite low
level one now, I hear) and a coffin, those two need a "get my body"
force.
