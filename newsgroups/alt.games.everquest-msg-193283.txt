A good one?  Never.

: Let's figure out what it would take.
: 
: 1. Client.  We need a free 3D engine.  The Quake II engine is free, and
: could handle dungeons.  I don't know how well it would do in large outdoor
: areas.  Presumably, Id will release the Quake III engine someday, and that
: can be made to work pretty well outdoors.

A 3D engine is only one part of the client.  There are a LOT of other
user interfacey and non-user interfacey things you'd need.  Lots and
lots of work.

: 2. Server (software).  Basically, we need a real time MUD.  This is not
: hard.

The RPG-y stuff can be harvested from several mature textual MUDs,
but it would still take a lot of effort to 3D-ize the world.  Think
about things like pathing and how that would affect AI and ranged
attacks.

: 3. Server (hardware).  OK, now we are getting to the hard stuff.  It's going
: to be hard to find someone willing to put up a cluster of 20 or so machines
: to support a server the size of an EQ server, with 3000 players and a huge
: item database.  We'd have to try a different approach.  I'll cover that
: later.

Actually, I don't think this part would be so bad.  Zone X could
be hosted by someone in California, zone Y by someone in New York,
zone Z by someone in Canada, etc.  It could be highly decentralized.
People could (and probably would) donate old hardware.

: 4. Server (bandwidth).  Same problem as #3.  Most people just won't have the
: bandwidth for a server.

This is a toughie.  Some companies and ISP's might be willing to
donate bandwidth as a kind of advertising ploy.  Maybe.

: 5. Content.  There are plenty of people who could and would design dungeons
: and towns and outdoor areas.  Same goes for story.  Model designers would be
: harder to come by.

The question is, would these people donating their time be *good*?
If so, you'd think they'd do it professional and get *paid* for it.

: 6. Organization.  This would be a problem.  You need to get a lot of people
: working together on content, without everyone going off and forking the
: project when one of their pet ideas is rejected.  Linux owes its success
: primarly to Linus Torvalds' skill as a manager.

Agreed.  A project leader with good social and organizational skills
would be needed.

: Assuming that a free-MMORPG version of Linus could be found...can #3 and #4
: be overcome?  Perhaps.  The architecture would have to be distributed, so
: that one world runs on serveral widely spread servers.  Each server would
: run just one zone, and the zones would have to be designed so that there
: generally won't be more than maybe 30 people in a given zone (the exact
: limit for a given server would depend on the upload bandwidth of that server).

Agreed.

: As much as possible would have to be offloaded to the clients, with careful
: use of cryptography to prevent cheating.  E.g., instead of a central server
: keeping the permanent character data, it would probably be stored on the
: client, digitally signed to prevent tampering.  The only thing stored
: centrally would be a checksum, so that when your character is uploaded to a
: given zone server, the zone server can verify that you haven't loaded an old
: version.

Great idea.
