(1) I don't get vertigo playing in windowed mode, I do in unwindowed mode.
(2) I can see more of what's in the visible area since I don't have any
windows covering it up (you can hide buffs, and I know what buffs I have on
by hitting "i" or by toggling them on).
(3) I find the visibility of chat/HP bars is much better in windowed mode.
Any change I could make to unwindowed mode to increase visibility there
would take away even more of the visible area.
(4) Windowed mode has every button that I ever use in it. It is far more
convenient for me to click my way through various menus than to hotkey every
button I might use and try to remember what hotkey panel they're on.

    The only times I enter unwindowed mode is to change the last four
buttons in my hotkey bank and to check on progress in alt XP. I don't need a
VR helmet and surround-sound to get "immersed" in the game, nor do I require
the larger graphics size of unwindowed mode.
