To answer a few questions, I will be more of a story leader, with 
ideaology and stuff, the actual leadership will be done by division 
leaders. There will also be a few officers for gathering the guild 
members up for events, helping run the events and, of course, take care 
of problems when some other leaders are not around (because of course we 
can't be around 24/7)

Second, I do have guild running experience. Though, not really in a 
game. I want to take the challenge of guild running in game form. The 
other thing is my little counter-strike clan which is only friends, but 
I set up the matches and stuff. I also ran a UO guild on Napa Valley. It 
wasn't very large (maybe not even popular or well known) but we had 
about 100 or so active members before many left when AoS came out. We 
got together, helped each other out, had some awesome guild wars (with 
other RP guilds of about the same size) and had alot of fun...

Since I am always having fun and socializing with people on EQ and know 
it would be alot more fun with people who had the same idea of what EQ 
could be like if everyone who played was an RPer, making a couple RP 
guilds of good and evil and having people who have the same ideas (if 
not the same character goals) can get together and have fun. That's the 
main idea behind most, if not all, guilds; to get together and have fun.

Lastly, since one person pointed out the 'two scariest words in my post' 
don't be alarmed, the 'essay' (just a short (or long) description of 
your character's background and effectivly using their background to tie 
in with why they might want to join either of the guilds. It doesn't 
have to be well written, as long as the thought it put into it, you will 
be added as a member of the guild.

Now I am not saying the creation of these guilds will be overnight, no 
this is pretty massive as they are not really casual guilds just for 
meeting others with the same interests, even though that is one aspect, 
but it also getting together with those people to do the activities that 
made you buy the game in the first place. We might even be able to do 
something similar to what is infamous in MMORPGs these days and is often 
called the 'vorpal bunny hunt' where a guild on AC asked GMs to buff a 
vorpal bunny up to their level and ended up getting the entire server to 
  go on the hunt, even though for most it meant certain death.

Even if you don't have aspirations to do something that the community 
will always look upon and go, "wow, I want to be like those guys!" and 
be rolemodels for newer characters, you can still join, play a part in a 
story line, and even give suggestions for the next part of the story 
line... Though if you want to make some noise and get noticed and become 
not only famous in a story, but be famous to EQ players, I just thought 
of something that *could* happen (not saying it will though) and maybe 
if our guilds become well recognized and recieved, maybe, just maybe, if 
there is also alot of petitions, the GMs will ask us about what we do, 
and set up a special server for the two sides of these pretty epic armies.

Well, I don't want to get an over inflated ego here and get people's 
hopes up for something that would only be a shot in the barrel but it is 
something to think about. Just remember, it's for fun so treat it that 
way if you want to join.
