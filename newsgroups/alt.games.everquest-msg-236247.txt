The theory does not match my experience.  I took about 20 items off my
trader and noted the lowest price in the bazaar for each.  With one
exception, all tribute values were significantly less than the lowest price
seen in bazaar.  Four items that go for from 300 to 3000p were all priced at
120tp.  All spells and a research parchment that normally go for hundreds of
plats were priced at 2-4tp.  The only item worth using for tribute was a
rusting hero shield which I could have sold for 650pp but instead got
1020tp.  It seemed to me that for almost all items you would be better off
selling them first then turning in the plat.
