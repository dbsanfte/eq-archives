I 100% understand where you're coming from. I suspect that from SOE's
point of view they can only talk to a certain number of people and
'cutting edge' guilds are experiencing content that 'family guilds'
will eventually experience via mudflation. SOE have pretty comprehensively
embraced power inflation as a means of ensuring what is todays
impossibly hard content becomes accessable to all tommorow. It means
they can feed in at the top end and rely on it eventually being there
for the 'bottom' end without having to constantly develop content
for all levels. I suspect LOY taught them a hard lesson about developing
for levels people are just 'passing through'.

Still. Given my complaints are about game character and not game
mechanics I am not optimistic about inviting the powergamers only. I
think somewhere along the line SOE forgot the content of the game is
the other people and their job is to provide an immersive world to
facilitate our entertaining one another. Its not like *any* button
mashing computer game could successfully engage people for 5 years.

Its the other people that do that.
