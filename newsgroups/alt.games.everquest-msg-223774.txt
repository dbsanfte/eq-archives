They added you onto their hate list when they ran past you, at that 
point, there is nothing short of a memblur type effect that will fix the 
problem.  Going invis, changing illusion and such will not change the 
fact that they want to kill you now.  If you had zoned out and back in, 
then put up your DE illusion, then you would have been fine.  This is 
assuming you have done nothing to kill your faction with them that is.
