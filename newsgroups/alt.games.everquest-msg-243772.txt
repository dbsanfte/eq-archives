WC can be a, well, rather dangerous zone for lowbies.  HGs, Griffs and that
bastard DE Shadowknight (Dragoon Zytl) tended to gank a lot of teens to 20s
headed to High Pass.  Much more dangerous than Kith in that you could wait
out the spawn, there (just don't wander aimlessly into buildings).  Most are
still around, just seem easier to avoid, now.  Seem that the pathing on the
Griff, in particular, has changed.  As to HGs, hang out near the druid rings
(north of them) and you will see a few.
