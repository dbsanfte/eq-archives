Um.

OK, once I hit level 70 and get the ultra rare 97% rez, I'm sure I'll 
stop using the clicky. 

If you are thinking of the 
spend-metric-tons-of-aa-to-get-a-rez-you-can-use-once-a-week.... well 
no, I'm never going to use that one in an exp group even if I do finally 
bother getting it (probably when it comes down to getting that or 
spending points raising my cha).

Its not there for the oh so massive extra 4% worth of rez, its there 
because it also gives your target full mana (is it full mana?  not sure 
on that part, never got one myself) and full HP and no rez effects, 
which means its used to get a raid MA back online NOW.  Waste it on some 
guy in an exp group?  Whats at stake there, at best my life and those of 
the people in my group, probably not even that, if the group can live 
long enough for the guy to zone out after death, then zone back in after 
I rez him, then I doubt very much we are going to wipe without him, and 
even more that we can't use a normal rez to get him back, slap a CHeal 
into him and let him work while still a little rezzy.

There is one other rez better than the cleric epic, thats necro only, 
good for one more percent back, but it requires the use of an essence 
emerald.  Believe it or not, I have recieved one of those rezzes in an 
exp group, by someone as cavalier with her 300pp rocks as I am with my 
10pp peridot for virtues.

What really won't wash is me using the cast 96% rez as opposed to the 
clicky one.  Yes, it casts slightly faster... however it has a cycle 
time, so that chain casting it actually takes longer than chain 
clicking.  I mem and cast the spell about once every few weeks, when my 
body isn't around; it is nice to be able to rez people while naked.  But 
naked I can cast it three times and I'm done, so even there its hardly a 
tool worth consideration on a raid basis.

Haven't erased the 96% rez from my book... but thought about it!
