I hear you, but a major portion of this decision is also based on what I
have been experiencing the last 3 months. I simply don't like the route
SOE's vision is taking the game. Don't get me wrong, I can understand
what they're trying to do, but think the direction they're going is
absolutely wrong.

I've seen a vibrant community deteriorate into, for want of better
words, a video game. I used to enjoy the interaction in the EC tunnel or
GFay depending on the server. Dealing in the bazaar is no different from
dealing with any other NPC vendor, the items are just better.

Take a trip through most old world newbie zones, and you'll probably
find them empty. I still get a funny feeling running through an empty EC
tunnel. New characters are almost immediately whisked off to Paludal for
quick power levelling.

It took me a year and a half to get to 60 because I do all the quests I
can find on all my characters. The rewards are nothing to write home
about, but the quest itself was the fun part for me. The recent patch
even trivialized the newbie quests. Spend time hunting the items? No
way, head to a vendor, buy 'em up, whoosh, off to Paludal. If that's the
way you like to play, more power to you. The world would certainly be
boring if everyone liked or did the same thing, which brings me full
circle in my "burn out". Everyone seems to be doing exactly the same
thing. There seems to be a "recipe" to get characters to Plane level.
Another gentleman mentioned that Paladins begin to shine at 60 and that
maybe so, but I despise raiding with a passion. It's simply not my game.
I find the tedious and time consuming setup followed by either 30
seconds of excitement or hours and hours of grinding endless mobs to
reach a "Boss Mob" equally boring. Do some people enjoy it? Certainly
they do, or EQ wouldn't be as popular as it is. Is that wrong? No, if
the majority of your subscribers enjoy this kind of content, then that's
the direction to proceed. I don't enjoy it. Should SOE change for me?
NO!

It's my belief that several play modes could and should be included in
EQ. SOE has decided to go the grouping and raiding direction. I see no
problem with that. It simply moves away from "my" vision of the game. EQ
is not the same game as it was when I started. Change is good and
needed, but the game has moved away from me. I had never played games
prior to EQ, and probably won't post EQ. The magic I experienced in my
first few months of playing EQ cannot be repeated by another game,
including the current EQ. On my second day playing with my then second
character, a Necro, I experienced the trauma of a lost corpse. I am
certain I got to the area in less than 2 minutes, but it was gone. I
also experienced my first "high level" help, when a 23 Necro asked why I
was running around. He loaded up the locate corpse spell only to inform
me that I had no corpses in the zone, yikes! It must have been a bug, I
knew exactly where it should have been, but alas my hard earned cloth
armor, lol, was gone forever. I was immediately gifted with a new
weapon, a rather nice robe, and some plat to help. That Necro is now 65
and a very good friend. I have several great friends from those early
days and will miss them quite a bit. We have tried grouping, but they
have always ended with, "gotta go, guild ordered me to a raid in <insert
any plane here>" I respect that guild loyalty very much, but that's not
the way "I" like to play.

/Ramble Mode Off

There is much more, but I feel my time in EQ is over. Very enjoyable
time it was and I wish all of you much success in game and in RL!!
