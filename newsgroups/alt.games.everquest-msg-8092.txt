Gee, a stealth nerf, what a shock! I wouldn't have noticed, I haven't
hunted there since December. But, even with the exp the same as other
zones, it is still a great place to hunt. The very thing most people
complain about, the high volume of players, means that a heavily group
dependant class like a Warrior or Rogue is always able to find a group
quickly. In 39 levels, I have never had as easy a time finding a
group. No matter how crowded the zone, there is always a spot for
another group to set up camp.
