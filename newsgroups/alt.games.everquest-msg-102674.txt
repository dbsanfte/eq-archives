Generally speaking, you want to put your best DPS weapon in main hand.  
This is not a hard and fast rule though.  If you have a 12 dps weapon that 
is 40 delay, and an 11 dps weapon that is 18 delay, you'll want to put the 
faster one in your main hand.  Why?

Damage bonus doesn't kick in on offhand swings.  On mainhand, it's applied 
to everyhit.  Naturally, the more frequent the swing, the more frequent 
the hit, the more guarenteed damage.

So way the balance between the two when decided which weapon to go with 
main hand and off.
