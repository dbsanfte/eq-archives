I didn't want the original Solstice earring so I held out for the easy
version. Dinged 59 around the time the quick way was put in, paid
756pp for the components and am now addicted to the two extra mana per
tick :) I did start regretting not doing the full quest even as I was
running around shopping for the scroll (I didn't figure on the easy
way being quite that expensive) and am now slowly collecting gifts for
two earrings (damned iron oxide).
