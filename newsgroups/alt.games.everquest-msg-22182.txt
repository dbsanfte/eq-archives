As a Monk I just about always request a Master Loot method just because I
cant deal with the weight. Also when Autoloot is on I am constently doing a
split for all gold silver and coppers to get rid of the weight. I have never
run into a problem with groups useing a Master loot system. Yes there are
some people that are greedy and may cheat you out of a few plat, but most
are more then fair and I always end up with plat only for my share. BTW
Druids make the best looters, with ports and SOW.
