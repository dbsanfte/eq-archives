Does anyone here think it might be a good idea to implement some kind
of "Mystical Portal" that would link the EQ and EQ2 worlds together.
Even if characters are reduced to level 1 and naked upon crossing, it
would still preserve the sentimental value linked to many characters
and I think really help the success of EQ2.  There could also be some
items and quests that could transgress both worlds and keep the game
fun.  Perhaps they could make an augmentation or something that would
allow an item to cross the worlds. I think the idea of just asking
everyone to just start over again isn't going to go over well, but
linking the worlds would make EQ2 a must have upgrade.
