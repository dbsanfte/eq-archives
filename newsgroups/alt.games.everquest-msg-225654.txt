Maybe not for all but I it's been a long time where I have wanted to book
some holiday to play a computer game.
I think it suits my style of play far better, whether it'll have the content
to hold me interest I can't say but if the (majority) of the community
remain as RP orientated as they now then things look good.

If anyones looking for a new EQ this isn't really it...If your a little
burnt out on EQ (I was only playing about 5hrs a week) then it might be
worth a look.

Still a lot to be implented yet so it should get better rather than worse.
Not sure what the balance is like for the PvP element but as both sides have
access to the same professions then hopefully it won't be like DAoC was.

CF <-- Looking forward to TF&F style Swoop races thru Beggars Canyon.
