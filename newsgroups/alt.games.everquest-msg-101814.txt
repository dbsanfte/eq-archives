try more RAM. it won't run on my machine with under 512.
i have an athlon 650 with a ATI RADEON 7500 vid card.

also, make sure you have the latest directx installed, THEN install the
video driver updates. also see post under subject header "bad lag" in
which i put some helpful windows adjustments for memory usage.
