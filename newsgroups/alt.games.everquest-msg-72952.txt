Since I know that tomorrow morning I'll be unwrapping a shiney new
GeForce3 Ti500, I figured that I should download drivers now before I
install it.

I've already got the drivers from Leadtek, but I was wondering about
the Detonator drivers that one gets from NVida.  My understanding is
that all the builds of the Detonator drivers are not that same?  Is
the latest build worth getting, or do I even need to bother with the
Det drivers if I have the manufacturers drivers?

Anyway, here's to some spiffier frame rate in Luclin.  :-)
