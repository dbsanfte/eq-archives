i heard on allakhazam that the bearskin potion bag has a 10% wieght
reduction.  i needed some wieght reduction bags, so i decided i would make
this one.  but when i made the bag (which was a miracle in itself, since it
is way beyond my skill level) it did not have the wieght reduction!

is there something special i have to do to give bags a wieght reduction?

come to think of it, is there anything special i must do to give anything i
make have special powers?  is it like jewelcrafting where i have to enchant
an ingrediant?
