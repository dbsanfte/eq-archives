I played EQ1 for 3 years and loved it.  I tried EQ2 when it came out mostly 
because I wanted to see the Bbautiful new graphics... which didn't 
disappoint me.  After 4 months of EQ2 I started to really miss the old EQ. I 
used to love to buff newbies when I didn't feel like hunting... not possible 
in EQ2.  I loved hanging out in PoK with characters of all levels and 
races... not a place like that in EQ2.  I still log onto EQ2 occasionally to 
say hello to friends, and have noticed the population getting thinner and 
thinner.  Are there other EQ1 players out there who have also been 
disappointed by the EQ2 world like I have?

If I could have my wish, I'd like to see the old EQ world with the new EQ 
graphics, interface and usability.  That would make a perfect EQ game.
