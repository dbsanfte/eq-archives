It depends. Do you like PvP a lot, or do you like the social aspects of online
games more? The new game is called Dark Age of Camelot and it has had a very
successful launch so far. A lot of people have left EQ for it, but a lot of
people have come back...It is geared mostly toward PvP in the end game, not
like UO though, you can only attack people of another realm. EQ is not PvP
oriented and is geared mostly towards group play and the social aspects of it.

EQ right now in my opinion is better than it has ever been, and they have what
looks to be an amazing expansion coming out in just a couple weeks. Dark Age is
still too new to know how its going to be in the future. So you might end up
just wasting your money if you get Camelot, but maybe not hehe.

I have played both games, I played EQ since it came out about 2 years ago and
I've played Dark Age since it came out (which means I haven't played it much).
I am back playing EQ again because I feel it has so much more to it, DAoC is
just missing something that makes EQ a great game.

And that is my opinion, everyone is different, what i dont like about Camelot
you might think is great.

If you do get EQ, play on the Tarew Marr server, it rules :)
