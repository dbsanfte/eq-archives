Again, I disagree.  Need is a flexible word, highly dependent on
context (as is necessary, for that matter).  As a trivial example,
you need a High Quality Cougarskin to complete the quest for the
Fine Antique Ring.  Greed, on the other hand, carries a ton of
pejorative baggage with it no matter how it is used.  That is why
an adult will make a point of smiling and/or chuckling to make it
clear that a reference to an infant as being "greedy" is hyperbole.

I'm not especially fond of "need before greed", but at least the
meaning of the phrase is generally agreed upon (preference in
loot awards goes to those who can and will use the item on a
regular basis with the character present).  Substituting some
vague mockery of "political correctness" that avoids conveying
any meaning has no value.  And while I don't find meaninglessness
to be ironic in most circumstances, I suppose there is a certain
irony in your use of a phrase devoid of meaning in an argument
over the meaning of words.  Perhaps not the irony you intended,
however.
