Go to either Lake of Ill Omen or try hunting Gnolls and Orcs with a group in
High Pass Hold.  Getting to Lake of Ill Omen may be a challenge for you.  If
you are an evil race or unliked by the Elves then the boat landing spot in
FV may be off limits to you.  Running from FV to Lake of Ill Omen is always
a heart stopping experience for people of your level.  Have SOW and avoid
spiders at all cost.  You will die if you let them get a hold of you.
