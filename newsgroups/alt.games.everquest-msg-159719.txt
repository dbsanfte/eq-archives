It really has been fun.  I have some RL friends at work, and we decided to
try and get all the Lucid Shards for the Vex Thal key quest.  Our group is
60 Warrior, 60 Enchanter (epic), 60 Druid (Epic), 55 Shadow Knight, 53
Cleric, and me 51 Wizard.

First we did the easy ones, DSP, ME, FG, and SD.  Now for the fun ones.
First night we did Akheva (we actually used the raid grouping to add a 59
Paladin).  We crawled our way through and got everyone a shard.  While there
we decided to do the ceremonial pit and get our scepters.  The 7 of us held
that pit for an hour and spawned the NPC (I forget his name...shadowed
something I think).  It was intense and we actually lost the Enchanter on
the last one.

The next night we did basement in Ssraeshza's Temple.  This time we
recruited a mage to CoH us down, but we held that camp comfortably, long
enough to get all of us a pouch.  We also did the skeletons to get the
shards.  Forgive me for not recalling all the details, it was my first time
in the zone.

Finally, we did the Deep.  Same group with a 60 monk as our 7th.  Wow, this
was fun!  Took us nearly two hours to get across the bridge and set up camp
to work the Thought Horrors, but we did it.

I still need to get SS, Acrylia and the Grey, not to mention the emperor
part, but so far this has been a blast!  Much more enjoyable than getting my
Trak key.

Peace,
XY (51 Wizard of Brell)
