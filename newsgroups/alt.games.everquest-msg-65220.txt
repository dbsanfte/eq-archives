Just as an aside, this seems like poor game design to me.  Since I've
twinked myself with some cash (actually a stack of peridots, since I
couldn't drop cash) I've been able to strip mine the vendors for
silks for this little project.  To date I have between looting (18 so far)
and purchasing, gone thru over 48 silks.  If I'd actually been killing
to get those, that would be an average of a hundred wurms.  OK,
so at first they are challenging, but by now I'm 3rd level, and the
Larvae continue to be 1st level mobs.  What sense would it make
to require me to kill a couple hundred level one mobs in order to
complete my first quest?  Thats with 5 points dumped into tailoring,
by the way, and 7 more gained so far in play, combining endless
quantities of silks and threads.  I know, any serious tailor will be
laughing at this complaint... but given that the only thing I can find
to sew up on the moon is this silk project, I'd hate to think how
abyssimally boring it would be if I had to do it without twink cash.

Cat in (oooh) full padded leather.  Quick, get the Twink Flame gear out!
