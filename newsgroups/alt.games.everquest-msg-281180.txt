I tried it for 2 months, and I occasionally feel the urge to try it again.  I
get over it soon enough.  YMMV, and here are some questions that you should
seriously answer:

Has this changed?  Do you have more money, or fewer good things to spend it
on than you thought?  

>and secondly that I was getting rather bored.

Has this changed?  Does it sound interesting and fun to do things that were
boring a month ago?

>enough time online, and felt my guildmates were getting waaay ahead of me. 
>My main was L28, and had only gained a couple of levels in the space of a 
>month.

Your guildmates are a month further ahead now.  Getting levels probably isn't
any easier.  Do you have more time to play, or a greater tolerance for being
lower level than some guildmates?

>I spent an awful lot of time trying to complete menial,

Again, what do you think is different now?

>So... why the hell do I want to go back, I ask myself?

Good.  Drop the implied judgement of "the hell" and answer honestly: why do
you want to go back?  There MAY BE reasons that you find valid, and lead you
to choose to return.  There may reasons that you find invalid, and if those
are all you have, you probably shouldn't.

Answer honestly: 
  Did leaving the game accomplish what you'd hoped?  If not, why not?  What do
  you hope will be different (about the game, or about your experience in the
  game) when you return?

>I feel like leaving

Kinda, except that in a relationship you have another human to whom you owe
some amount of fairness and compassion.  You don't owe this to Sony, and
nobody's feelings will be hurt because you dumped a game.

There is no moral failure in quitting a purely recreational activity that
isn't fun.  There's no committment you're breaking, and nobody who feels
hurt that you've chosen something else to do.

>Anyway, I can't decide. I have heard relatively little about the new update

>with my dilemma.

If it's really a dilemma, stay away: you're taking it too seriously.  If it's
a fun pastime that you're curious to try again, and you feel no compunction
about leaving again if it's not fun, I say go for it.
