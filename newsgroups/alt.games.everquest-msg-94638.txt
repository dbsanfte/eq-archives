Well, it is allowed in some jusidictions.  I recall a rather high-profile 
court battle about whether other states had to recognize gay marriages 
performed in Hawaii.  I can think of several European countries which 
recognize gay marriages, and several large cities in California (home 
state of Verant) that give spousal rights to gay partners.  
That being said, Everquest is a fantasy setting, a pay for play world, and 
I suspect that public perception is more important than the actual RL 
rulings on the official recognition of homosexual unions.  Maybe I'm 
completely off-base here, but I suspect that the average EQ player is 
slightly more tolerant of homosexuality than the general population.  (I 
am basing this on the demographics of EQ players vs. general population 
[young people are MUCH more likely to approve of homosexual unions than 
older people], the fantasy RP aspect, and the impression that there are 
very very few fundamentalists of any religion playin EQ.)
Sure, there are the ghey suxx0rs mu5+ D13! jerks in EQ, but to a lesser 
extent than other games I've played.
