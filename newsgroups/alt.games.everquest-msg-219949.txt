   Just curious, but how do you know how many people receive this newsgroup? 
It's kinda interesting if true.  I figured we had to have a few more people
posting than lurking, but didn't think the ratio would have more than 45
thousand on one side.  

   Anyways, I play on Lanys sometime.  A baby necro named Teamort that I dig out
when I really want to play, but Lenny is nowhere around.  I think most people
are going to respond in group, rather than email.
