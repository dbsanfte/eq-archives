The clerics that I play with most often seem to like it a lot.   Try using it
on Luclin mobs... they tend to be easier on the resists, while having a ton of
hit points to get rid of.   I've seen it used to great effect... but then as a
warrior, I've always been a big fan of damage shields.    It's pretty funny
when things hit you for 20 - 40 points of damage, and takes 45 back from your
damage sheild ; )    Win win situation.... and on most fights the mana /
damage ratio gets to be pretty incredible when you add it up, unless a shaman
is slowing them.

Of course, of the four clerics I play with semi regularly, only one is under
58... so that may help a bit with the resissts.

I can only estimate from what I see... but I've yet to see a cleric get
significant aggro from it, unless he cast something else on top of it.    Or,
as I said, in Cazic Thule.... although hopefully the patch fixing the taunting
there will go live soon. ; )
