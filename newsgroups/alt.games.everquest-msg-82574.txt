Pretend it's a commercial on TV and block it out. I seriously doubt that any
name you have seen has been so offensive that you had to petition that
player. Trust me, it's far more rewarding taking on the next MOB.

Bitter? Hell no. It's just a game to me and when I'm making love to my wife,
I'm not strategizing my gameplay for my next gaming session. However, in the
spirit of the fantasy genre, such names seem to be appropiate with halfling
rogues. Afterall, I've seen names such as Fuzzytoes, Funkyfoot and others
that seemed fine to everyone else.

BTW The GM assigned the name Nimblethorne to my character. Go figure...

Are you telling me that "Stinkeyfinger" is offensive to you? Sounds like a
fine halfling name to me and my friends got a kick out of it too. You must
also get upset when you see the ogres scratching their asses too...

In a fantasy setting, just about anything goes. It's not like the characters
name was "Nazilover" or some other obviously inflammatory wording.

Again, what is "innapropriate" is purely subjective under the EQ rules.

TOLERANCE!
