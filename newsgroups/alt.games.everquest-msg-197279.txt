Speaking as someone who was the only level 65 warrior in a guild of 70~ish
active to semi-active people, you're full of shit.   You have no real idea
of the amount of time commitment you are seriously suggesting.

I was going to post my previous response on this topic, but upon searching
it out over Google, I see you're the same person I was explaining it to
then.  If you didn't take anything away from that discussion, you're not
going to understand now.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go cry myself to sleep over not living
up to your standards.   Especially when those standards are based, not on
what you are doing for your guild, but what you imagine you will do, if you
ever make it to a level where you can.
