Typical PK play. It's why I never want to play PvP. The romantic grand
struggle face to face is mostly myth. Punks preying on lessors are the
norm. Still waiting for a PvP that addresses the random bully acts.
Many sound good on paper, but fall short after implementation and thew
usual d00ds find the loop holes or exploit of the system.
