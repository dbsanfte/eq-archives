You might want to re-read it again.  It's patently obvious what the scam 
is.  Sucker emails a hotmail account (remember, SOE has stated publically 
NUMEROUS times that all email to/from them will use verant.com or 
sony.com) with login name and password.  Ummm, at this point, this asshole 
here opens the email, uses the login name and password, and has your 
account.  Of course I've already reported him to ATTBI, and to 
sony/verant, and I would suggest that everyone else do also.
