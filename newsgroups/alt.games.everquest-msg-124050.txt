To dish out absolutely sick amounts of melee damage.

That's just a part of the game mechanics.  Might not like the name,
but there you go.

There are several dungeons that require keys to get into and move
around it.  Keys you don't need if you have Pick Locks.  Also, there
are a couple of dungeons that REQUIRE a rogue to open locked doors.

At your level you should get some people and hit Befallen.  Nice
newbie dungeon, and has not one, not two, but THREE locked doors.  You
can get the keys easily enough, but if you're a rogue......

>Pick pockets is of no use as far as I can see

Get the skill up and find mobs that drop plat.  Start pickpocketing
plat.  You can eventually, if I remember correctly, pull coin off mobs
WITHOUT aggroing them.  Sometimes anyway.  :-)

You're level 11.  There are other traps in EQ, as has been pointed out
elsewhere.  Might not be a 'use everyday' kind of skill, but it's
very, VERY nice to have when necessary.

Ok, and what weapon is your warrior using and what weapon is your
rogue using?  Remember, it's not always how hard you hit, but how FAST
you can hit.

Let me share with you a little story.  I take my 52 druid on an Umbral
plains raid.  I was ferrying people to and fro and I got there late
and got stuck in the 'leftover' group.  It was me, a level 55 wizard,
and a level 60 rogue.  He was not the only level 60 melee there, also
in attendance were a couple of 60 pallies, several 55+ warriors, and
an assload of high level casters.

The wizard was having connection problems, but while he was there we
got EVERY SINGLE KILL.  And when he was LD, we could still get the
kill if I went OOM nuking.  And at 612pts a nuke, I wasn't that much.
I made a full yellow bubble of exp on a raid.

>I like rogues.  It's just a shame that Verant are 'indifferent' to them.

Don't take this the wrong way, but mayhaps you should play the class
for a significant period of time before you make such sweeping
judgements.
