 If you actually read the board you would have seen this post:

 
 Hello Folks,
Do to the fact that we are going to be having a few patches in the next week in order to try
to keep some order here on
the boards and to better organize the amount of data we are receiving here we will be
�wiping� the boards after every
patch. 

We are not doing this to ignore any issues that exist but rather so we can see who has not
been fixed by the patch(s).

Some of you may still be having issues that we are going to be working on and some of you
may issues that will need to
be resolved by you, with our help, and so if you have posted and found your message deleted
we apologize and we want
to assure that we are only doing this in order to serve you better.
