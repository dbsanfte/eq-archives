Have you overclocked at all?  I don't even think you can on a Compaq without
getting a new motherboard, but if you can and have that could be a problem.
Also, have you installed any components that did not come with the computer?
What are they?  Did you have problems before you installed them? Do other
Direct3D/Glide games run fine?  I would be very surprised if it's a
connection problem, because if it is, you should be getting the disconnected
screen instead of being kicked to desktop (unless you have the worst
connection problem in history where you're getting malformed packets that
say "kick this player to desktop" but there's a 99.9999% chance that that
isn't it ;-))  You probably do, but just in case, make sure you have the
latest DirectX and drivers.  Other people have had the problem though I
don't know what they did to fix it.
