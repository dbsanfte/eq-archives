You can find excellent information on these subjects and more at:
http://pub148.ezboard.com/bpaladinsofnorrath
Go to the Squire's Yard forum, check out the stickied threads.
Also, I would especially recommend the "Arcand's Tale..." thread,
which is an ongoing journal by a newbie Paladin playing on the FV
server with comments and answers to his questions from other
Paladins.

Good luck to you, I hope you enjoy the journey.
