I went and tried them, but they hit maybe a bit harder than the strongest
"goblin raider"'s in frontier mountains. Also tried centaur chargers and
they hit a bit hard too (ac 803 unbuffed). Harriers give me no xp
whatsoever, so they are no good. I think the tesch mas are all green/no xp
but ill check that out. maybe try a clops in RM on the bay back to kunark.
Oh well, at least i got from 191 to 192 for my effort against the avocet.
