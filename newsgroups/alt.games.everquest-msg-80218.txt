Heh, I've heard that this was the case, but wasn't sure if it was true or
not.  That's pretty funny.  Since players can spawn on top of each other,
why not have mobs pop on top of players?

My original point goes back to the days when some would *insist* on not even
being in the same room that mob x spawns, for fear that they would prevent
it from popping.
