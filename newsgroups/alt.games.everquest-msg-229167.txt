I hope they put some kind of fast advancement system in for people who have
already played through, or they will have the same kind of problem DAoC has
at low levels, but worse.

In DAoC, you pick a base class at character creation, and then at level 5,
you pick your final class.  Consider Friars and Clerics.  They both have the
same base class.  So, levels 1-4 are *identical* for them.  The only
difference between a 1-4 who is going to be a Cleric and one who is going to
be a Friar is that they probably allocated their stats different.  All the
rest (spells and fighting ability) will be the same.  If they picked the
same race, they'll have the same starting area, the same quests, the same
trainer.

That's nice the first time or so, but after that, you just want to get out
of 1-4 so you can actually start playing the class you intended.

That sounds like it could even be worse in EQ2, because at least in DAoC, if
I did a Cleric, and then tried something else, as long as that something
else was not a Friar, I'd at least have different spells and skills 1-4,
even if I picked a race with the same starting area.  (Would still have many
of the same quests).  If 1-5 are the same for *everybody* in EQ2 of a given
race/start point, no matter what class they are aiming for, I can see
getting sick of it real quick.  Seems it would be 1-5 worse; 6-14 about the
same annoyance factor as DAoC, 15-29 less annoying but still annoying.

What they've done on DAoC that helps greatly with this is making it so if
you reach level 50 with any character on your account, you get to use the
/level command on your other characters.  /level, if you are below 20, sets
your XP to enough to put you at level 20.5.  There are NPCs in the capital
cities that will give you gear so you aren't naked.

I wonder if they'll do something like that?  I'd like this:

    1. If you reach 15, you can start new characters at 6.

    2. If you reach 30, you can start new characters at 15.

    3. If you reach 45, you can start new characters at 30 in the same
    group.  That is, if you have a 45 priest, you can start new priests at
    30, but if you wanted a mage, you could only start at up to 15.

    4. If you reach 60, you can start any new character at 30.
