It doesn't sound like a connection problem.  A connection problem would not
suddenly drop you to the desktop.  Try the following, in whatever order you
want:

1. Underclock your CPU.  Athlons run hot, and you might be hitting a heat
problem.  Underclocking will make it run cooler.  See if that makes it more
stable.

2. Bad RAM could cause the symptoms you see.  Try taking out some of your
RAM and see if it gets better.

3. Try EQW.  The only times my WinXP crashes is in EQ or DAoC--both
full-screen DirectX apps.  I've not seen a crash since starting using EQW
about a week ago.
