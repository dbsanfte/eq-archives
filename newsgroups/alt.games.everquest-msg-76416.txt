Not sure you can see all who is a member, only the online members.
Type /who all GUILD or /who all g2 (2 are the guild number, type the 
number of the guild), or finally you can type /who all "Sceptered Isle" 
(again SI is the guild name, and capital letters ARE important here, our 
ally guild are a LOT easier to get with /woh all g181, than with /who 
all "The Small Chaotic Gods of War")
