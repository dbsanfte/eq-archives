Asking is a waste of time unless you are doing it for RP'ing purposes.  If
you want to inspect my possessions, please do it and don't ask!  Asking is a
waste of time and I am already too lazy enough and do not need to give a
reply to a question like that.  It is a basic game function!  If someone
gets angered or pissed that you inspected them, they are most likely a
jackass anyway and deserved to be ticked off.  Make sure you keep inspecting
them afterwords too if they get angered.  That goes in the same boat with
some idiot shouting "This area is camped" as soon as you arrive before you
can spin around.  In that situation, stay and annoy them, just don't kill
THEIR pulls.
