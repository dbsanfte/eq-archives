    Yep, reminds me of the good ol' days when I started playin Ultima
Online. I got pk'd everytime I would set foot out of town. I could barely
kill a rabbit at level one, yet the pk's would swoop down and kill me, quite
gleefully, and then proceed to emote they where ass-raping me and calling me
"StUpiD NoOb!
    That was the good ol' days NOT!
    Nothing wrong with duels in EQ though, good feature, and pk servers nice
too if you want to pit your skills against other players that expect it, but
my opinion in general of pk's is the same as bizbee, they are pricks.
