Wait until your in 59, it is so demoralising going through that level, after
a while you don't even bother looking at your exp bar.. got to a point where
I was 2 blues away from 60... thought to myself "nearly there, probably ding
tomorrow after a good session", continued playing and then after a while the
DING! came, for a moment I actually did wonder "what the heck was that?" and
then seen the text welcoming me to 60... that DING!, even though its the
same as the previous 58 ding sounds, certainly sounds louder

Bit of an anti climax on he AA dings
