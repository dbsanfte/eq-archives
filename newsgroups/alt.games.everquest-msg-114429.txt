In fact, I do find the concept of a bunch of careless incompetents 
suddenly being struck by divine inspiration and producing a game that we 
all enjoy somewhat difficult to grasp.

I find it easier to believe that some people throw around big words, like 
"incompetence" a little bit too freely, and I give them as much credit as 
your average "Verant Hates Druids" rant. I think that given the 
complexity and sheer size of EQ, we're lucky that things are going as 
generally smoothly as they are.
