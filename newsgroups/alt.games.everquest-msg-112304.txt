2ï¿½ You should say what server you are on. If you don't run into someone that
is a smith, you are liable to find a tailor who could make you reinforced or
a higher level with a spare set of armor from upgrading.

There are also some on the cheap armor you could get from the Millers if you
are in the area and have the faction. Something like bear hide boots, belt,
and a wolf hide cape<sell HQ bear pelts to other players> would be better
then leather.
