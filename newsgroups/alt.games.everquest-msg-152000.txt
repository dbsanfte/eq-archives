I'm sure glad I don't live on the same planet as you and hughes.
Druids are flat out trivial to level.  From the moment you first
mem Snare you can kill decent xp mobs with zero risk.  You have
spells that are a wonderful addition to any group from lo level
on.  Starting at L19 you have freedom of movement unmatched by
any class (Wizards do not get SoW).  There is no class in EQ
easier to level up.  Whining about root/dot being slow just
tells me you're an idiot.  Try meleeing every mob to death and
then recovering from it.  Try having to do CRs twenty times as
often that take twenty times as long.  How awful it is for
Druids, having to wait for the mob to die while they med back
to full.  Just because you have the attention span of a retarded
chicken and get bored waiting out root/dot because you're too
damned lame to group does not mean that Druids are hard to level,
it just means you're a moron.
