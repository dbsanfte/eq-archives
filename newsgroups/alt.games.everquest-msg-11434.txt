Yes, if we had the european style of bloated bureaucracies with their
fingers into everything and over regulation of all that walks or
crawls; we'd still only have CompuServe charging 12 bucks an hour to
access. If America is guilty of anything, it's that any moron can have
access to the Internet for a relatively low cost. Here in California
it's 9 bucks a month at the low end and no time based connection fees
by the phone company. Any 15 year old can scrape that up if he wanted.

It is ironic that we are being bashed by a foreigner using a US
creation (the Internet) to talk about a US product EQ. Some may hate
us, but they sure enjoy sucking on the US teat of innovation.
