Ok, I cannot attest to how well a mage will do... I am a beastlord.
I usually do toe to toe, but I did go there with a necro friend who is
58 and watched her aggro kite one (just to see if she could solo
there)

Many single pull... there are a few that double.. but if  you look at
them you can tell which ones do that.  Id strongly suggest stay away
from the mushrooms... they can be singled, but they can also come in
numbers, and they proc some nasty stun and damage.

The loot here isn't bad either... many spells drop, as well as several
items that sell well to vendors...   eyes sell for 20pp each, and
chitin sells for 10 pp each... oh and the shiknar Ichor sells in the
bazaar for round 40 pp on my server (the ichor is used to make shssar
bane weapons I belive).

This spot is extremely sweet when duoing, but I can solo it with
little to no issue.  

of course if you have any other questions, fire away my friend...
