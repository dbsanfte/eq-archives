The only one I found annoying was VS faction at the OT vendors. I hadn't picked
up all my spells yet. I "fixed" it by rolling a level 1 gnecro to do my shopping
for me.

If you have PoP then you really don't have to worry too much about faction
anymore. There are a couple of researched pet spells that could also be
purchased in SK guilds, so I went to the Warrens to get Paineel faction. I'm not
sure that's necessary now.

You can't get a Book of Dark Bindings in Ak'Anon. You can get it in Neriak or
QCats or, if you have LoY, you can go talk to the guy in Gunthak to get the
6-slot research book.
