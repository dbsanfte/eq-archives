Only for the person who's getting the three items.  Cent LS sells for less
than a Lammy alone on my server.

I've been in two groups recently in DL, in one, the shaman refused to buff
us (including haste) unless we donated! and in the other, the enchanter did
nothing but Clarity and Haste (under serious duress) and then claim to be
OOM for the rest of the time!

I love the new group xp bonus, but it's encouraging people to group who've
never done it before, which is great if they can learn, and terrible if
they're soloers within the group structure.
