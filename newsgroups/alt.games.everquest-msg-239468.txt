I hear shouts in PoK at times for language lessons. Go there and shout
that you need to learn Elvish, that's the most used language on the
server for trades and shouts. It's the common language of the server
by popular demand.

With FV there is no common language. Just the racial languages and
thieves cant. With the other servers (not sure about any of the PvP
servers) there is a common language that everyone knows.

The time to master a language is dependant on wis or int, which ever
is highest. I've tried to learn it with low wis on a BL and it was
very slow to skill up but it started to go much faster once I got my
wis to 187.
