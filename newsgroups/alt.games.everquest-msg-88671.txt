    Ah glory days of my youth. I did that, even had my guild tell me to give
up never get it.  Was not until I ran into huts of generals minions in Kith,
or tryed zone into cabalis, or drown out in middle of ocean, or etc that my
guild really knew what impossible was, but even those I did alone, dont give
up! Basicly not too bad, get someone to port you out and come with you or
get someone drag it for you with nice ooc or shout.
