Nope.  This pressure exists just by the nature of the game.  Allowing only
one player at a time to be experiencing desired content is nasty, and there is
a special place in hell for game designers who think it's a good idea.

Camping, killstealing, and general monopolization of content happens for
in-game advancement far more often than it happens to make RL money.

These spawn points would be camped anyway, once it was known that a uniquely
valuable item was available there.
