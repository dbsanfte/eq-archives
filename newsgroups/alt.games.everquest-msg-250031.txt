been suggested many times. The thing is, it would be throwing away
upwards of $27,000 or whatever the server world costs SOE, in order to
have a server with a very small population. Any veterans know that it
is better to play on a server they are already on with an existing
character, knowing people and having help from friends as well as
their other characters. 

The server would really just be a short term novelty, like regular new
servers are. Everyone would make a character or two on it to play as a
low character in a low world, then get bored of it. Then it sits
there, hardly used for $27,000, while other servers are overcrowded
and people would like to move off of them.
