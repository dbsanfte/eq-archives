You won't succeed at a rescue by bypassing mobs, you've got to clear
the path to the exit.  However, if you don't have a tracker a scout
can be useful to find the hostage so that you don't waste time
clearing the wrong path.  For an assassinate mission you need to
kill a certain # of mobs to spawn the boss (ca. 30 kills, roughly
half of the mobs required to succeed for a slaughter) at which point
you can invis and/or pacify up close to the boss (I've twice been in
groups that would not have succeeded before the timer ran out except
that we were able to pacify past a bunch of mobs).
