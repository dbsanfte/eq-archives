Well, if all you're doing is snare/fear/nuke you just have to pick the
critters that have fewer HP than you have mana.

If you want to reverse kite higher critters I'd probably
snare/fear/dot-nuke-nuke then med until fear broke...in the Old World
anyway.  On Kunark or Velious (don't know about Luclin yet) Fearing has this
nasty habit of occasionally taking the critter too far away so they don't
come back to you when it breaks.
