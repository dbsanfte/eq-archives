If you have many characters on PvP servers and you will end up with
more than 8 after the merger, all of your characters will still be
there, you just won't be able to access some until you either transfer
other character to different server or delete them.  Shared bank will
also be deleted as it's impossible to merge up to 4 different shared
banks into one server.

The accessiable character will be in alpha order.
