I heard slightly different than this. I don't know if it was officially
corrected or not but it did explain results people had with the skill.
Basically, as you say, you go through an animation that does nothing but
ends in a kick. If the kick succeeds, the mob goes running. However, the
kick supposedly did a kick skill check, so classes with a kick skill,
like monks, had reasonable success with the skill, while classes without
the kick skill like rogues and bards had very low success even with
instill doubt maxed. Just like large races with inherent bash capped to
one, rogues and bards only got the benefit from their offence when the
to hit test was done.
