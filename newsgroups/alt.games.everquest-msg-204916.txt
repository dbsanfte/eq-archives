I agree.  The reason few young characters play in the "older" areas now is that
with Paludal you get mega experience and can stay there for 10 - 12 levels,
leaving only to get water.  The fungals even drop food!   As much as I love
Paludal I think it's a shame to see the Derv and Orc camps sitting empty in the
Commonlands...
