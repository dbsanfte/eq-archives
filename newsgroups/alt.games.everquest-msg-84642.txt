Ikkys get regen, better vision, better AC, better starting swimming, 
looks a LOT cooler, and can do the Shackle quests. And with some faction 
work they can do the sash and headband quests that humans can too.
On the downside theyre KOS most places, so need some faction work. And 
have those pesky 20% XP penalty.

Humans are nightblind, normal regen, no AC bonus, low swimming, looks 
dull, cant do the shackle quests (ikky only, even if you manage to 
become unkos to Cabilis).
On the positive side theyre not KOS, they are better at HtH (althought 
the HtH weapons with Luclin cancel that since they got their own dmg/delay).


Personally the looks on ikkys alone are enough for me to play an ikky. 
The rest are just bonus, but would NEVER consider making a human monk 
(ok, got a mule i used to give in the stuff for sash and headband quest 
to avoid faction work).
