Ok, I can see your point.  But, how do you fix it without eliminating
the player economy (or rendering it essentially meaningless)?  TLC
certainly didn't work well as an add-on, but if it was an attribute
like MAGIC/LORE/NODROP/NORENT that was considered and used as part of
the design when game areas were itemized and quests were scripted I
can see how it could be much more effective and useful.  Item wear
seems problematic, with a lot more ways to do it badly than to do it
well ("realistic" is rarely equivalent to "fun" or "entertaining").
Level restrictions can be used effectively, but they can also be so
overbearing that they detract from the game.  If you don't tolerate
any twinking at all you remove substantial role-play opportunity and
might as well be playing some console game with a tightly scripted
progression.  For that matter, some "mud-flation" is a good thing as
well, IMO, otherwise after the first couple months of play you are
only doing the same thing that everybody else has always done (it
would help if most of the mobs upgraded very gradually as well, to
compensate for the steady increase in effectiveness of the players).

I would say that leaving most of the "old world" almost completely
static while introducing lots of new content is the real problem,
rather than mud-flation itself.  The (mostly) static world is a
totally unable to deal with improvements in player effectiveness
(be they gear or tactical improvements).  A more dynamic world
incorporating self-correcting auto-balancing mechanisms that adjust
(slowly) to player behavior, with at least some of these corrections
persisting across server resets, is gonna be the winning solution.
I'm not saying you can completely automate these mechanisms, but
partial automation combined with planned content evolution would
create a much more interesting long-term gaming experience.  And if
it were done well it could create more distinction between servers
running the same game-world, also a good thing, imo.  Whatever game
manages to do a good job of providing more dynamic content first,
whether along the lines of what I suggest here in some other fashion,
will likely be the next killer mmorpg.
