    Fights where a healer doesn't really heal - must be nice. ;-) Given a
sufficiently-high level puller and a solid mez/slow setup, I usually have a
few stuns, a MoK for each mob (rarely resisted), and a Cel Heal or two. If
we have a bard and/or shaman, the Cel Heal may be swapped out for a Divine
Light as the main tank will have all buff slots filled. :-/

    You haven't been with good bards. They can park a few with relative
ease. Where bards fail, in my opinion, is that they can't do it all at
once - an enchanter can have three mezzed, the active mob slowed
significantly, and have me recovering mana at Clarity 2 rate. A bard cannot
do all that at once, so my mana recovery rate takes a hit.

    One of the spells a mob can cast that gets me on my feet and stunning is
Annul Magic. Always.

    No. Whenever you feel it's better to do something, you click DA off. I
only keep mine up until whatever made me DA isn't on me, like a really
cruddy version of Jolt.

    Only good when you know they'll need it, a waste otherwise. I have three
tanks: warrior, pally, ranger. Which one will need healing? How much?  Who
will an add zero in on before being controlled? I don't have mana to waste.

    If I don't lay down an initial heal on the ENCH, an add can kill them
faster than my reaction/heal time. It's better now that one can
insta-interrupt oneself, but I still worry.

    Nor do I. But chain-healing to SAVE the enchanter, plus my moving to
between the enchanter and the mob, plus a stun or two, do it nicely.

    Have your Disciple's Symbol of Brell Serilis yet?
