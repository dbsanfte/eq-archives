The Necro as PLer can only be beaten by a bard or a monk.  The
Legendary(now) level 65 Froglok cleric within 48 hours of release was
supported by a team which had a monk at the core for DPS.  The power of
massive DPS+ Complete agro drop can't be beaten.  As I understand it
the complete team was cleric,druid, shaman, enchanter, monk, bard.
But the monk did the heavy lifting.
