Hi, I'm new  here, and love the content on AGE. I'm new to the game and
really enjoy it.
Devon and Ben started talking about this and it made me wonder...
What other things should a young Ranger consider? I didn't know I would
break Mez, for instance.  What types of advice would you give to keep a
newer player (Ranger, specifically) from annoying you?
What other affects am I going to mess with with archery?
How does a rangers' role change when grouped with different classes?

thanks,
Steve

>>Yeah, I wonder how many enchanters are unaware of that? A ranger using
archery has to be careful of mobs in the direct line of fire. But
enchanters and main tanks should be aware that if the target is moving
around, an arrow can go astray, and there is a significant delay
between when a ranger shoots and when the arrow arrives, more than
most people realize (and its gotten longer with the new archery
change).
