I haven't played EQ in like six months, sometime last fall. I'm trying 
to play now and wasn't able to validate my key on PoP. The GM in the 
chat room said network congestion is the cause.

I figured I'd just play anyway without the expansion, then I'd register 
it later. But I connect to Cazic-Thule, it loads all the stuff, I choose 
my character, it goes to the next screen before entering the game, then 
I'm booted back to the desktop. No error or anything, I'm just back at 
the desktop. There's a period of hard drive activity after I'm back at 
the desktop, probably the game crashing or whatever. I tried to log back 
in and it said I had an active character on the server and to wait for 
synchronization.

Any ideas why I'm crashing like that? I tried with and without EQW so 
that must not be the cause. I had a custom skin loaded last time I 
played, could that affect anything?
