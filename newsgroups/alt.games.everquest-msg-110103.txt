Is anybody else having *HORRIBLE* performance from the UK, on ADSL? 
Everything was okey until they slashed the prices. Since then, I get an 
average packet loss of 25%, with long periods in the red, and ping times 
of up to 2500 for unacceptably long times. It's so bad some days I can't 
even do tradeskills, let alone travel or fight.

I'm with Force 9, although I imagine that ultimately all connections go 
through BT.
