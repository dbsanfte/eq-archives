Thanks, A.  I wasn't the OP, but my next toon is going to be a bard and I 
had some questions I was putting off until character creation time.  But, 
as the answers may help the OP, I'll ask them, now.

I was thinking of doing a Cat Bard because of the high STR and STA.  These 
are the starting stats for them...

STR STA AGI DEX WIS INT CHA 
95  75  90  80  70  65  75 

... with 25 points to allocate.  I was thinking 15 to STA, 5 to AGI and 5 
to DEX, leaving me with...

STR STA AGI DEX WIS INT CHA 
95  90  95  85  70  65  75 

Do you think that pumping more into STA and STR makes more sense when it 
comes to the late ( 50+ ) game?

I'm worried about the 65 INT and if being "sub-75" is going to hurt my 
mana-pool for Charming later on.  Any idea, anyone?  I don't care about 
tradeskilling with this guy, so that's not a factor to me.

CHA equipment seems rather easy to come by, so I wasn't too worried.

I like to melee, and will do a lot of it while twisting, so I am was trying 
to allocate points based on the idea that I'm going to get hit a lot.

Do any of you people that are knowledgable about bards have any input on 
starting race - pros and cons?  I will probably do a Vah Shir, but the OP 
asked about this and I haven't seen an answer, yet.

Oh, yeah, 1 more.  I read on Castersrealm that Cats get a starting 100 in 
safe fall.  My Cat Rogue didn't, it's currently maxxed at 75 I think.  Was 
his starting value decreased because he is a Rogue, since they have it as a 
skill?  Seems to me my rogue should get the better of the 2, which would be 
a starting skill of 100.
