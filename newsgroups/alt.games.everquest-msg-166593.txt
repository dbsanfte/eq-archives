Well, they were reliable in the sense that it very rarely took more
than an hour to get between EFP and BBM.  But it was pretty rare that
you could depend on the theoretical maximum time of ca. 40 minutes
for that trip, because the two boats seemed to lose synchronization
immediately and inevitably you would see them < 5 minutes apart once
the server had been up for a day or two.  I <think> this was caused
by the boats waiting for passengers to zone, and once the gap between
them got out of balance you'd end up with more passengers boarding
the boat that fell behind (due to the longer wait for that boat) which
made that boat more likely to lose time due to a slow zoning passenger.
And then there was the boat pathing, which would get screwed up and
dump passengers on the dock because the boat moved thru it instead of
alongside it.  And these problems were after they had fixed the bug(s)
that resulted in deaths with lost corpses in OOT, which led to a lot
of people doing boat trips naked or near naked for some time back when
I started.
