Do you get kicked to desktop or just to login or server select?

The former is/was seemingly due to the badword filter bug, the latter due
to problems with Sony's networking code (i.e. their "bandwidth efficiency"
measures causing fake LDs). The latter issue also causes LD when zoning.

(And it's a real problem, i.e. an actual bug, or a random tell would
not cause the packet loss to mysteriously vanish.)
