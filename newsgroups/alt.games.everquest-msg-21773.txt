> How bad do wizards suck?

They dont . They are in fact quite usefull for single mob encounters . They
are very wanted on huge raids since when they nuke full str they frequently
are the group that gets the kill . They solo very well . They are beloved by
their friends for transportation .

In an exp group they absolutely rot . If all you want to do is gain
experience quickly and efficiently the wizard is the worst type of choice
for a group mate .
