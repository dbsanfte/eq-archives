 Suspensions have been lifted. As always, visit www.legacyofsteel,net
for the rest of the rants. 

 Paragraph of note:

"Suffice it to say none of the alleged means the GM stated were used -
in point of fact, player gflux is disabled in that zone and if you must
know, the pull did not and does not involve a monk whatsoever. Moving
on, the Warders were down when we did the pull as the previous day we'd
bounced CoH around VT to kill their parent mobs, thereby despawning each
appropriate Warder. The random key nonsense is just that - the keys are
no rent but it is merely an exercise in annoyance to nurse them via
corpse or decess/CoH to get the needed one every 55 mins in the case of
any Key Dramaï¿½... we've done it both ways~"
