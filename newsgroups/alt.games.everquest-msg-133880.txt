Both. 

Flurry is a small latent chance of 2 extra attacks per melee round with
your primary hand

Rampage is an activateable melee PBAE where you hit (or miss) all mobs
in melee range with one attack. Melee range is absolutely tiny, and the
recharge on this is *36* minutes

Both are nothing more than eyecandy, and shouldn't even be considered
until you have spent 60+ points

The 'nerf' was referring to an early bug where activating a hotkey,
reset the timer on all used hotkeys to that which you had just pressed.
So you rampage (time on ramp button = 36 mins), then hit an instacast
(timer on instacast = 0, timer on ramp button = 0) then you could hit
rampage again. Some things are nerfs, and some are fixing obvious bugs,
and this most definitely fits into the latter category ):oP
