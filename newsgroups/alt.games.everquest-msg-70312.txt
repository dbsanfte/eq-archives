Ok fed up of lurking so......

I use a Dell Inspiron 8100
P3-1Ghz 512Mb 32 Mb Geforce2go 15" screen running XP Pro
Works no problem at all even with SoL installed, running in 1024 (have run
in 1280 as well but textures looked strange) with all new models and
textures at medium and using the built in softmodem....... Only time I've
really noticed the frame ratedrop is in EC Tunnel with 113 other players in
there (though my friends Athlon 1400 with geforce2 was the same) Went to
Luclin to have a little look round slightly laggy but havent been back since
all the patched of the last 10 days or so.

Hope this helps


Dave
