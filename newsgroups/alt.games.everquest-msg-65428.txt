I would have to say the issues are you video card and your memory.  I have:

PIII-800
768MB PC133 SDRAM
GeForce2 MX400 with 64MB
ATA100 7200RPM 40GB IBM HD
ATA100 7200RPM 80GB Seagate HD

I have everything turned on and maxxed out on SoL, only issue I have seen is
more frequent pauses while playing.  I would not want to be on a raid with
that happening, but for normal XP fighting it has not been an issue.
