No special faction with the scribe is required.  Once he's charmed, just
give him the vial, and he returns the ink.  In fact, if there are multiple
enchanters there, they can all hand in their ink once he's been charmed -
it's not limited to the person that charmed him.  I haven't tried this
personally, but the scribe didn't despawn when I handed in my vial, so I
assume that anyone else could have handed theirs in as well.
