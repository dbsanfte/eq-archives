Wow, real specific. Sounds more like a load of crap, sounds more like 
you have never used Mozilla 0.9.4 or Netscape 6.1 more then 30 seconds. 
*shrug*

I don't know where you went to download. But it is a 200k exe that 
installs everything you chose from the internet, just the stuff you 
want. Just like the IE installer. More proof that you have never 
actually downloaded or used it, just skimmed over the download page (maybe).

You know what the wonderful thing is? I could really care less whether 
people visit it or not. I don't get paid, I always get bitched at, 
etc... I am doing all of this work for you guys to bring you a trainer 
and a good informative website 100% free, yet I just get bitched at 
because you can't use one of the thousands of browsers available. I am 
really thinking about a pay for membership access. You people are so 
feakin' ungretful. At least I would be getting paid.

Uh, how about I don't and say I did.
