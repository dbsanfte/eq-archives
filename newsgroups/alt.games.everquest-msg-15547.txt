What? They're asked to leave, and only if they're really, really good at it.
I would love to be the person roughed up for using my brain in a casino.
Then I could own Jack...Binion, that is!
;-)

Counting cards without a mechanical aid is NOT cheating.  It will make
casino owners upset because the odds (which are still in their favor) fall
more towards you (but still up for them).  They can ask you to leave, but
they can also ask the guy in the yellow leather hat to leave for no reason,
either.

They do NOT consider it cheating, just bad for business...cheating at
a casino lands you in jail.  And they WILL bust you.  They have whole
departments just for that.  Counting cards is NOT cheating, just using
your brain.  As long as you are not using some sort of mechanical/electronic
device to help you count (yes, this even includes simple pencil/paper)
you CANNOT be arrested for it.

Sorry, just a pet peeve of mine.
:-)
