Er, how exactly does one "not read" someone else's name? Do you place 
your thumb over the monitor when they do a /shout or /occ?

Ohhh... I see. You got caught breaking the naming policy, and now are 
bitter about it. Well, I can only say I wish we had such commited GMs 
here in Fennin Ro.

As for what other people may find offensive in "stinkyfinger" in a 
fantasy environment... Well, if it's not self-evident to you, I don't 
think I could possibly explain it. Just take our word for it, okey?

Well... Perhaps your intolerance of those who would like to enjoy a 
certain degree of immersion in that "fantasy world" goes some way towards 
explaining it.

> I say again... It's about having fun, not a way of life, losers!

Yes. So why would you want to diminish someone else's fun by choosing an 
innapropriate name?
