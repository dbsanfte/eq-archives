The advantage comes with the lvl 29 pet which dual wields when given
two weapons. Other than that theres a lot of discussion whether or not
the weapon lower the base delay of the pet.

Well, with the faction issue regarding to shopping and training is
gone with the PoK and Luclin. But quest-wise I would say Chardok
faction - Good faction here may yield you very nice items for a necro.
Just don't kill the Sarnaks in LoIO, and stick to the goblins you'd be
on the safe side. Doing the Mines of Nurga at 35'ish, should boost you
all the way to amiable.

Even my Iksar necro is well liked in Chardok now :-)

The pet goes after anything that attacks you, so you have to make sure
that you are not under attack when you issue the /pet back off.
