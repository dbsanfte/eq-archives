Ok so I've been doing this quest for about 3 months on and off, have =
done the usual which is - read up on this get the info and know what I =
require.

Now the problem came when I gathered my claw mounts (yippee) no need to =
beat the hell out of those sonic wolfs as they hurt like hell. Suddenly =
realise that I now require the services of others doing a similar quest =
although they maybe a shaman or bard - this is to achieve a weapon that =
has a damage of 10 with some adds for mana and magic.=20

So ran around for a while checking out my kinfolk "hey you have claws - =
can you help" - "no I bought them". This is the stock answer to this =
question, admittingly didn't see them with the claws of the savage =
spirit, there's appeared to be better and who could blame them.

So my question is in two parts
Have I read this wrong and I don't need others to help and can do this =
for myself if so great (please answer yes).
Or do we have a quest that I am doing that I could only complete =
assuming there is a good number of people doing this as well.

If its the second one - surely this is no longer a great idea and, =
should be altered considering the difficulty is not doing the quest but =
finding somebody else that is.

Any ideas welcome.....
