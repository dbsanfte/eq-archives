If I have to leave a group where I am getting good exp and loot, I'm
going to hit myself with a fish. Then, if it still seems like a good
idea to leave my group, they'd better be paying me for my lost XP and
loot. If my group is waiting for me to come back, I'm sharing the money
with them. This recompenses them for their lost time, money and loot.

I'm all about being fair as much as I can. Just as my favorite rogue
shares (via autosplit) all he pickpockets, I will share with my group my
rez money- it's a skill I have that can earn money for all of us. I'm
not into a "me-first" mentality.

If I have a click-stick and am in a group, no, I won't charge for a rez
if they bring me a body. I will charge if my rogue has to look for 'em
and drag the body over. That's time taken away from the group. Anything
that takes time from the group should be charged for, in my opinion, and
the money shared.

Enchanters passing out clarity, rangers and druids passing out SoW- the
mana lost is not noticed by the group, and does not slow them down. But
if a druid or wizard is constantly leaving my group to port someone
elsewhere, I AM going to have a talk with them about whether or not they
belong in a group. And money or XP we make while they aren't there, is
ours, not theirs. My group functions without them. And I'll point that
out if they leave a lot, and replace them. Any enchanters enchanting
large quantities of precious metals while I'm in a rocking group, will
probably be encouraged to go elsewhere too.

While in a group, everything is for the good of the group. The purpose
of being in a group is to make money and XP. If you aren't helping the
Group, get out.
