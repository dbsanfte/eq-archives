Damned skippy.  Still, a 10 minute fixed duration snare, for a
whopping 35 mana, is a huge, huge bonus in the solo ability for druids
of ALL deities.

Well, yeah, and I can get FT items to offset mana regen times on my
druid.  Druids get it from the get SoW at 14 for a couple of plat.
Big bonus on the druid side.  Just like enchanters get the whole mana
regen bonus.

The inability to control your pet is still a problem.  And they do
lack in other offensive abilities.  They can offset it, but still they
solo a bit harder than druids.

Still, enchanters aren't bad for soloing, just not quite as good at it
as druids.

Can I get an amen.  My ranger is pretty much locked into DL/Karnors
right now because I tend to play late at night and wandering where
ever to find a group only to find the zone empty can get really
frustrating.

Druids still got it a bit easier.  SoE make things easier, as does
Egress.  Even without it, Luclin is fairly small.  I don't think
there's a zone that takes less than 15, 20 minutes for me to get to,
which is nothing.
