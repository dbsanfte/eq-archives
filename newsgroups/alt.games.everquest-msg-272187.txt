here. I did notice some weird order on your posts so I just asked
whether I was the only one. After all it could be MY newsreader. But
seemingly it wasn't. I don't want to offend you.

I truly do appreciate your kindness and civility towards me. 
Unfortunately several others are not so nice, using the "F" word,
etc., causing me to feel like this is a "me against the world" thing.
 I apologize if I responded to anything you personally wrote in an
offensive way.

I meant to be offensive to the jerks.  ;-)  I am just having fun with
them.  To get so bent out of shape, using profanity, insulting me,
questioning my family heritage, etc., is really quite hilarious, and
part of me enjoys getting under their skin.

ignored. If you keep up your attitude that you are against the rest
of us then sorry. Must be very funny talking with never getting a
reply but it's your call.

The product I am using is written in PHP to translate usenet to and
from a PHP-based web interface, and it does not appear to be in
active development any longer.  Therefore, I can either try to modify
it myself (I am a programmer but not of PHP, so that is not likely) or
stop using it and have nothing to provide usenet access to the web
site (also not likely I am going to stop using it for this reason).

Oddly enough, I continue to get plenty of replies to my messages, as I
had been using this for several weeks before anyone pointed out the
faulty behavior.

I think the world will keep on turning even though my replies aren't
properly threaded and I will do my best to either learn PHP or find
something else to fill the need.  That's the best I can do.
