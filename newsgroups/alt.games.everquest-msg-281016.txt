And not just one time - there are a number of paths to level up that have
only minimal overlap in quest lines.  I'd wager I can get my next
alliance character up to 60 and only overlap a few quest lines - I'm
aware of the existence of whole other zones of quests to do with them.

I'd also wager I can get a horde character up to 60 without much overlap
in zones/quests.

By then maybe something new will be out for it (Hero classes) or maybe
not - but that's a ways away for me (I don't get a lot of time to play
anymore).

EQ borrowed from other games - new games borrowed from EQ - EQ reborrowed
good ideas from them.  And so it goes - cross pollination is the norm.
Of course, not all ideas borrowed translate as well.
