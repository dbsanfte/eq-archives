   If you're actually interested in the developements of EQII, as I am, you can
always go see what Moorgard, the EQII communitee relations guy, has had to say
on any particular topic here at
http://www.eqii.com/phpbb/viewforum.php?f=33&sid=1fe62c043f3bd175082e9e7bdef3a572
.

    In referance to hardware requirements, the he says this in a few different
posts:

People thought Verant was crazy for releasing an MMOG that required a 3D card,
but the gamble paid off. 

Likewise, we make no apologies about designing a game that will need a future
generation of hardware to see its full potential. We intend for our game to be
around for years to come, and as processors and graphics cards get better and
better you'll see EQ2 improve in appearance--without needing an engine overhaul. 

That said, the game runs well on machines that are far from the top of the line,
and DX9 cards aren't very expensive these days. We're still testing to see where
we want to put that min spec, and we do want the game to perform well on the
average system. But at the same time we want to be realistic about the hardware
requirements and aren't afraid to set the bar higher than the typical game if we
have to.

I suggest you all start a betting pool as to how many CDs will come in the box.  

As of now, we don't know the final disc count. It depends on a couple factors,
but we anticipate a healthy number of discs. 

Whether we release an optional DVD format is up to marketing to decide.

I have a GeForece 4 Ti4400 with a P4 2.53ghz CPU at home and my machine runs EQ2
nicely.

Due to our engine design, video card choice is important. The card must be fully
DX9 compatible, as our game makes use of those features. Both Nvidia and ATI
make terrific cards that run EQ2 very well. 

CPU will always be a major factor in games, and certainly the faster you can
get, the better. You can save a significant amount of cash by going for a CPU
that is a step or two below the top-of-the-line model and achieve performance
that is very very close to the best. 

RAM is still a relatively low-cost component, and the more of it you have the
better off you'll be. Most of us at work play with one gig of RAM, and that
seems to work just fine. Really, anyone running Windows XP should probably have
that much anyway for overall system performance. 

People ask me what the best system for EQ2 will be. Though it sounds a bit
facetious, the answer is really "the best you can afford," but then that's true
for any game on the market. I'm certain there are tradeoff areas--a faster video
card might make up for a slightly slower CPU or vice versa--but in general, a
well-built system will allow you to play the game quite happily without needing
the very best of every component. 

Keep in mind, we've built our game with the future in mind. It will take CPUs
and video cards that aren't on the market yet to be able to play our game with
all options cranked up to full. The idea is that as computers get faster and
faster, our game can look better and better without needing an engine overhall.

He says more, but these are what I felt might be the most relevant to this
discussion.
