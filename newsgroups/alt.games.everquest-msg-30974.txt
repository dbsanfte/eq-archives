Appears in my newsreader that this message from Shirley is older than
the other, similar post, yet it arrived on my news server after the one
from '10 posts up' you're referring to. It probably didn't get
propagated quickly or widely for some reason, since all the replies are
to the later thread, so I'm guessing Shirley reposted because she didn't
see her original message appear, when this thread was lost in the ether.

As to the original question, it should work fine, although Win2K and EQ
have some issues with the SBLive, so YMMV, also if possible get a 64Mb
version of the video card so its a bit more future-proof.
