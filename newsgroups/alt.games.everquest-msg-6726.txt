You know what I didn't see mentioned on the list of changes? Something to do
with shark meat and some quest in Vellious or somesuch.  I dont' really know
what it is, but it was mentioned in some other threads.  I didn't do it, but
I know that our guild chat this weekend was *full* of people creating mules
all over to hold backpack after backpack of shark meat for othe people, and
tons of porting around for something that was supposed to make you an
instant millionaire. ;-)
   I'm too low to go to Vellious, so I didn't look into it, but if they were
in such a rush to fix it, I thought they would have mentioned it here.
