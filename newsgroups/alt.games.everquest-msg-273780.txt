The question I've posed doesn't hinge on whether I did or did not forgive 
him, it asks where you got the idea that I was incapable of forgiving, based 
on what I related. In effect, you're stating that because I did not forgive 
him, I was therefore incapable of forgiving him. Doesn't compute.

And BTW, this wasn't a case of just "forgiving" him, it was a larger issue 
of this guy's likely ongoing behavior. I considered all factors including 
the act itself, the lie about his character alt, the pathetic tells, and the 
fact that he was a level 42 healer without a guild and it all added up in my 
mind to "This guy doesn't have a future in this guild." I related all of 
this in my original message. Reducing the totality of these experiences to a 
simple "forgiveness" over one incident misses the bigger picture that I'm 
charged with managing.
