Well, there are plenty reading these posts who are offended be overuse
of profanity. So, by your own admission, it's wrong.

Why? Because they don't go to verbal extreme you might in a similar
situation?

Simple. Use of profanity is wrong. You can't prove it or explain it,
but that doesn't make it right. We all do it at least once in a while.
The question is do you see it as a slip up or not.

As to the quality of the movie; I don't get your description of
"spinelessness", but I do agree that it was a bit of a letdown on the
whole.

No it doesn't. Right and wrong is not a relative concept. It is not in
any way interpreted with regard to context or environment.  I wish
more people understood that.
