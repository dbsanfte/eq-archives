	Well, no...

	Look, I'll try to sum up my whining:

	There's several classes of bugs you typically find in software.
One large class of those is the class that includes trivial programmer
errors that can be easily and inexpensively detected and corrected at
an early stage in the product life cycle by use of simple tools and
processes that have been standard best practice since, oh, 1995.  I'm
offended, both professionally and as a customer, to see that SOE clearly
can't be bothered to implement simple best practice.  That they don't
is abundantly evident by the classes of bugs they let out into production:
incorrect static initializations, incorrect arithmetic, bugs that were
fixed and then return over and over again...  The truly sad thing is
that by implementing what everyone else has done for decades they'd spend
much less money on operations and could have that much more for development,
bug fixes, or their stockholders.  And the customers would probably notice
the improvement, too.

	Memory leaks are a different class of bug.  There's not a lot of
point to chasing seldom occurring and hard to reproduce problems when
you can't even count on your data structures being initialized properly.
SOE rightly doesn't care about these.  The, well, bug, is that they don't
care about anything else, either.

	They don't test.  "Testing" does not mean having your 7 year old
cousin run his twinked froglok wizard around PoK for 20 minutes before
you roll out the patch.  Great Ghu, you can take a graduate degree in 
Quality Control, did you know that?  It's a regular *science*.  And it's
*not* programming.  It's more like applied statistics...

	And speaking of bugs, when are they going to fix the bald druid
bug?  When did that appear, 2002?  Geez.
