An opinion, my experience is as yours, if you get rooted you will often end
up knocking the mob out of your range but the mob can still hit you.
I was saying, in the case of Giant sized mobs this would be acceptable but
in the case of Dwarves (and indeed Ghouls) I think it's wrong.
I don't think I should be able to outdistance a mob because I am carry a
Lance and he is carrying a dagger (of course this would more realistic but
also easy to exploit against very simple AI) but I certainly can't see why I
can get hit by some coldain Dwarf with his Velium dagger when I am carry a
f*cking huge lance and am out of range.
