Very true, in fact, it's Story Time again! (The group groans,
dreading another rambling tale)

On my first CoM raid, we were going to kill, among others, Rak'ashir,
or whatever he's called, that badass with the 2000hp fire AE, anyway.
The standard tactic calls for as many fire pets as humanly possible,
and just let the shaman drop after he turns in his epic piece. As a
cleric, I get assigned a fire pet to keep alive during the encounter.

So, as he sometimes does, old Rak gates. One by one, the clerics get
summoned to their deaths deep in the City, but I have all the time
in the world to log out. Why? I used Celestial Healing to keep "my"
pet alive, and throughout the fight, Rak stayed at glowers dubiously,
and didn't bother to summon me. Heals over time generate insanely low
aggro on the cleric.

One good use for CR/CH: use it on the chanter the second you see him
draw aggro. That way, you can help him stun the beastie, while your
HoT heals him. This works for other finger-wagglers, too, of course.

Another good use: If your puller is close to full health and about
to pull, put a CR on him, and it'll heal him while he pulls.

My advice: Get a friend who has SoL to buy that spell for you. You'll
love it in no time.
