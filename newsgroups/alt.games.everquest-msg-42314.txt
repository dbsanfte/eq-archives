You will not evade me, "eravanna" <eravanna@tampabay.rr.com>:

Barring the illegality of what you're trying to do, I don't really
need the following items:

>2x oppliuine Earrings ac2 plus 5 cha ea<br>

Opplius must be fascinating gems.

>Split Paw Necklance AC2 Cha Plus 5 Poson save Plus 5<br>

I need magic, fire, cold, disease and poison saves, but not poson.

>Ruined circlet wis, INT both Plus 4<br>

I sure as hell don't want a broken circlet.

>237 PP plus a bug of stuff in bank inventory such as <br>
>iron bars and brewing supplies<br>

W00T!

><BR>
><br>

What are these <BR>s anyway? Burning rapiers? As far as I know,
they're lore...

>plus 3 ear ring<br>

A ring with three ears dangling from it? Eeew!

>Forest loop ac2 dex,wis and Alg all Plus 3<br>

I have a chloroplast spell, I don't need extra algae. Some algae are
poisonous too, you know, and poson resist won't help with that.

>Tizmak Sleaves ac8<br>

They sound a bit sleezy, you know...

>Braded ivory cord ac 4  plus 5 wis<br>

Brad's cords?

>Brown chitlin Protector  ac 12 dex sta and alg all  plus 9<br>

Mm, chitlins with algae growing on em, now that's good eatin'!

>thick leather apron ac 8<br>

Did you use this while you prepared the chitlins?

>Chitlin shield ac 15 plus 10 poison saves<br>

Mmm, almost gettin' hungry fer some roadkill here...

>Runed Falcon D 11 34 delay<br>

Ok, where did you catch that falcon and why did you carve runes on the
poor bird?

>and a Pally goulebane LS<br>

Does this have to do with angouleme or whatever that word was in the
Nostradamus stuff people have been spouting lately?

>and several hundred Pp in bank<br>

W00T!
