My visual cue is usually my char standing up with several lines of red text 
in the chat area, followed by a stun and some more red text, followed by a 
stun and 1 more line of red text followed by LOADING... PLEASE WAIT.

If I would pay more attention to the ( typical ) duo and less to the 
constant stream of jokes we toss back and forth, I would probably get more 
EXP.  Wouln't be half as fun, though.

Had me, 2 druids, and a Cleric in PoN messing around last night, having a 
charm-fest and seeing how crazy we could make it.  Having 3 charms break 
within 3 seconds is a blast when you got 2 other mobs in camp, and they 
hate the cleric because he just CHd one of the pets.

I only got 4 blues in the time we were there ( after dropping Ulump and 
wiping out the Black Reavers ), but it was a freakin' fun time.

Got to scribe my new haste ( WR? ) and Bedlam, too!  If I would get all 
those 51-58 spells that I missed scribed, I'd be happier.  I accidentally 
bought the level 60 AOE tash instead of the 57(?) one a while back, so I 
still don't have it and I never see it for sale when I look.
