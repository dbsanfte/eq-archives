Really depends on the quality of the disks.

I used to buy expensive disks (as in $20 per box of 10) while other
people I knew bought the cheapy ones (like $3-5 per box of 10).

Some of those good quality disks are still readable after 10 years,
while the cheapies I bought later tended to fail within 2 years.

Just another case of "you get what you pay for".

Magnetism is only one hazard and disks will fail even if shielded, since
they are also affected by humidity - the oxide is essentially glued onto
the floppy plastic platter after all and will degrade with time and
temperature/humidity.


Some of those original game disks were of shockingly low quality.
