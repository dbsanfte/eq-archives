Walk into the ranger guild hall in surefall glade. First guy on the left
wall is wearing chain mail. If you talk to him he will mention a sturdy
outfit. Talk to him about all the items. There is another issue he will say.
A poacher named jenkins is wanted, his head only. Get his head and bring it
back, he will give you a useless scout sword. Tells you to get it sharpened
in a forge with a sharpening stone and return in with a snake skin and a
fang. What kind of snake skin, seems I am unable to print the chat, and what
kind of fang.
Hope that helps you.
