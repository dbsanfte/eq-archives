Play a gnome or erudite necro, and you wont be KOS in most places. Kaladim
and qeynos will probably still hate you, but with POK and the bazaar that
matters not. Necros are a little hard to solo between levels 14-33. After 34
necro becomes really easy, but before, and especially close to 33, you will
probably find the going a bit tough. Druid is easy going all the way, and is
faster soloing after 49 with either quad kiting, or charming animals in PON.
For a first char, I would definitly suggest trying a druid.
