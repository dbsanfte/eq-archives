Sounding fishy.  The only mention of /report I could find was that you
"should have done a /report right there."  You could have done a report just
about anytime up to the point you logged out.  If by any chance this is just
a feeble attempt to harass someone you don't like then be warned that
harassment is a bannable offense and they do like to enforce this one.
