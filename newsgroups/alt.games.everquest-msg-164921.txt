  OMG.  You guys are coming to join me in test?  OMG OMG.  I have a
Shaman, level 5, will be higher by the end of the day, beastlord level
9, and lowbie enchanter... about four.  Also, I'd be fine with rolling
up something new. I usually play cleric or shaman, and I've been told I
play them well, but I would also love to try something new, namely
enchanter.  Any of those three would be ideal.  Mondays are fine.  You
had all _better_ let me in or I'll, I'll cry.  Alot.  In
serverwide.age:age.
   Need a warrior?  I can talk Lenny into coming along as well.
    Emailing this to Jekke as well.

Annie <--- Loves this idea... if she gets in.
