/em falls over, stunned.

Someone besides me likes SWG?! YAY! I mean, I figured there were people out
there somewhere who did, because I see plenty of people in game, but you're the
first person I've encountered that says they do. (Yes, all those who have, are,
and will tell me how horrible it is, I know it has its problems. Find me a game
that doesn't and I'll be falling over stunned again).

Hi, my name is Kingsmythe... and I enjoy playing SWG.

*Hi, Kingsmythe.*
