I didn't mean to imply that it was excessively dangerous, but there
are two factors to consider.

1. All other Nexus ports are completely safe for all levels, and this
will lead to many people undersetimating the risk. Remember all the
whining about the Iceclad Druid ring?

2. The GD port is shared with the Odus port. Players trying to go to
Odus to hunt SB and Warrens (ie sub-35) might screw up and hit a zone
very lethal to them. I took the trip down last night, and unless you
pay close attention you could easily take the wrong port.

Cheers
