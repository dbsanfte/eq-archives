Well, I didn't -want- to... He actually had all my most expensive 
droppable gear. :) But the options seemed to be, (1) wait forever 
for a GM, (2) find a way to end up under the world and moved to the zone 
safe spot, (3) get -someone- grouped with him, so I could TL him or CotH 
him, or (4) Find a way to die, and then deal with the slightly easier 
task of summoning his corpse.  I'm pretty sure I tried ideas from all 4 
categories before a resolution was achieved. :)
