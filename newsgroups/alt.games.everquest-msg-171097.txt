What are the most potent 2 and 3 character groups?  Looking at
starting a regular group with 2 friends, but one may flake regularly,
hence the 2 character combo as well.

Target range is 1-40.  We'll never make it to 50 so I don't want to
worry about upper level characteristics.  Just a group that is fun for
that range.

First consideration for 3 class combo was paladin, shaman, wizard.
2 class combo was shaman, monk.

Thanks.

~JK
