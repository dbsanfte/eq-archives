Yeah always get the new drivers. And the newest version of directX
because eq definately won't work with old versions. A possibility
could be this, that card may be a little old because they did have
geforce4's back when directX 7 was being used. If the CD you used to
install the drivers did happen to reinstall directX 7 somehow then EQ
will not work at all so try re-installing directX 8.1 or whatever the
most current one is and see if that helps.
