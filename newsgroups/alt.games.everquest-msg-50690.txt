Yeah, and wisdom or int whichever is higher affects it EITHER way.
Some silly int enchanters STILL think they should put on a bunch of
wis stuff to try to get more successes.. even if wis or int DID affect
sucess it would still be whichever was higher otherise WIS tradeskill
priest types would have a hugely unfair advantage. 

So I go with what verant says, for a tradeskill get one or the other
as high as you can and then the other stat for the skill like str for
smithing and you are fine. Unless verant mentions a stat like str for
smithing, don't go assuming that one affects the trade either.
