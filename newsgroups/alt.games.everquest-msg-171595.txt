I bought the lvl 49 water pet in the bazaar but that was a rare find.  It
seemed like some mage had gotten enough components to make the scroll
several times and was selling his xtras.  I managed to catch him just as he
was cashing out and about to log.  If a magician doesn't have the research
skill to make the 49 pets and can't get another mage to create the scrolls,
he better learn to love the earth pets and MSII for a bit.  Might be time to
start chaincasting in that case.
