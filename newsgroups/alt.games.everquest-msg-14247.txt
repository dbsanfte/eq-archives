Hehe, "abuse of code" like that was considered required skill set in Q2 and
Q3. You should see some of they ways people learnt to "abuse" the code :ï¿½)
Saying this of course you are playing people who, assuming they spent the
time learning these techniques, would be able to do the same thing (Double
jumps, circle jumps and strafe jumping were all "accidents" in the Q2 engine
but were actually written in, to a lesser degree, for Q3)
The difference with EQ is that the mobs have only limited AI (VERY limited)
so exploiting the engine against them may seem valid but you are not in a
battle of wits with the computer because it has no wits.
