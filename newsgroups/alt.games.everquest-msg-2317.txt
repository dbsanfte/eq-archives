Hello, a long time ago about a month or so anyways I posted here asking what
the best race/class/diety combo is for soloing.  I got around 30-40
responses ranging from. Iksar/SK/Cazicthule? to Human/Warrior/None.
Notably missing from the list was Human/Bard/None
I have tried every combo that was suggested and played them each AT least as
far as lvl 5 and some as far as 20(Erudite Mage).

I love my Mage, and my Barbarian Shaman, but no-one EVER told me how much
fun playing a Bard could be.  My little bard shot from lvl 1 to lvl 5 in a
matter of 5-6 hours and when I hit 5 I got Selo's Acclerando and did the
Entire mail delivery quest in less then 4 hours.  While doing the quest I
hit lvl 6 and got Hymn of Restoration (Healing) so now I'm practically
unstopable.  I LOVE this kiting thing and managed to Kite just about
everything in QH at the same time.

So now for my question.... Why does the Bard have such a bad rap?  And why
are there so few of them?  I REALLY like this character, I seem to have good
melee abilities and great magic abilities and the best part is I NEVER have
to med to get my mana back up and can cast while moving.  Am I missing
somthing here?  Is there something critical at higher levels that I should
be aware of?  Or did 989 Studios, Just decide they were going to make a
class with no faults and call it Bard?  I mean seriously If I had known that
a Bard was going to be this fun and this easy (zero downtime) I would never
have played any other class. So is there a catch to this?
Sincerely
Tiffanie (Bard of 6 songs)
