I tried a PoE (livestone chain, is it?) helm combine the other day.  Failure
=/
I can't find any stats on it.. but it HAS to be better than what Im
currently wearing.

I fucked up on the reading of the ingredients list though, and didn't factor
in 2 tempers per try (well leather is only 1!) so I have tempers made into
the planar steel rings, but I need more liquified earth to make an equal
number of tempers (again..).. sigh.

The plan with the livestone is 2 bracers, arms, and helm.  With 1 failure
already, thats now looking like 2 bracers and helm (arms are "ok").. as soon
as I get more earths anyway.  Ah well a day of PoE soloing this weekend is
called for (not like its guaranteed I'll even get 1...)

Whats the best spot for killing the muds, for earths?

The only even remotely high concentration of them that I've seen are the 1
static by zonein, 1 static near mephit ledge, and the wandering mudwalkers
when the rings up.

Rare ass mobs, and even rarer drop rate /rude

Well comparing my bots to a guild who can't kill Aerin'Dar and Behomoth is a
little off :)
Seeing as they do that gay teleport thing, Im gonna guess its not something
I can solo.

Even if I can tank it, and have the mana to keep me up, the minute I got
ported out we'd be fucked.  (I'd be tempted to try 1 group Dain, if he
didn't banish!)

Not a debuff bot at all.  I don't have to do things like slow mobs (f that,
its dangerous!) unless say, the main shamans die.  He does things like spam
heal the MA, keep my group / clerics healed and cured, and (more
importantly), keeps me alive!

He does group a lot though (like 99% of my elemental groups).. so I guess
your average shamans role.

Oh you can say that again! It makes me cry to think how many earths I used
to make rings now, when they are rare as hell, and the chain armour would
hae been a way bigger upgrade

Whats a fair price on the furs?  I recall from guildie druids what a bitch
the velium hound farming was... I'll just buy that crap, not staying in WW
for a few weeks!
She has (been a while since I looked) 190 smithing and 176? tailoring.. so I
guess shes close enough to try the attempts

Will do, once Jak gets his crown and bracers!

The thing she wants most now is a BP (Seru BP, to be specific).. which is
fairly weird, cuz theres never been a single item or slot or mob she's ever
asked for "xxx" from (and as a raid cleric for the past year, with something
like 4 loots total, she doesn't really care about her gear or feel confident
to ask for stuff :/)

Where is he located?  I checked track yesterday, about 3 hours after the
servers were up and he didn't show.   Sure hes 1 groupable btw?  His loot
(125hp earing!) seems more raid level than exp mob.

I try to avoid trees at all costs when Im tanking!  I have no real need for
saps atm, and I still have a PoE bow sat in my bank, so they are just exp
mobs.  Exp mobs with an evil dot, horrible snare, and melee range of 300
miles!

Where does the froggy pop?

So far I've only seen the named tree and named croc. (Oh and 2 named by
vineland, but that was the first day of Elemental access, and we weren't
able to kill.  Those buggy ass traps meant the surrounding mobs were
actually stacks of 5+ mobs, instead of just 1)
