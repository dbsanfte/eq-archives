Gnomes with a good Tinkering skill can craft a "Stalking Probe" which
will have five charges of Eye of Zomm -- any class can use.

The ingredients cost in the 200p range, so you'll have to
shell out at least that much if you want one.

If you think that's funny, try getting a Ball of Golem Clay,
from certain mobs in Cazic-Thule.  Any class can use the single
charge on it to turn themselves into an Earth Elemental (same
illusion spell that Enchanters use to do it).  That would
really freak out your friends.

To REALLY confuse people, combine that with an item from Upper Guk,
which will let any class cast an Earth Pet...  It's not every
day you see a Warrior as an Earth Elemental with an Earth Elemental
pet tagging along behind him...
