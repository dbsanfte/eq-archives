Oh, I never looked anywhere but straight ahead with glasses.  One of
my friends once asked me why I moved my head while reading - it's because
only straight ahead is the imamge not distorted.  My current glasses 
have the smallest lenses that I can have (short of the completely round
ones) - when I discussed it with the assistant who was fitting frames
I had to explain to her that I never use the rest of the lense, since
it's too distorted.
