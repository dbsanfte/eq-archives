Why not just IMPROVE THEIR TAUNT?  (Sorry to look a gift horse in the mouth,
but it seems like they're going the long way to fix a short road.)

o.O  I sure hope all +STA items get turned into +EDU.

Yay!!  I was really figuring they'd do a "50+ AA" thing again.  I'm glad to
be proven wrong.

That's actually a real interesting way of doing it.  It also means that the
high-capability warriors who do major raids will have a shot at some real
nice abilities that will set them apart.  My raiding friends will love that.

Also good news.

And more good news--I think.  Heh.  And shorter timers would be REALLY good.
When you're talking a duration that lasts seconds, a timer that lasts close
to an hour (or more) is pretty sucky.

Clicking a button:  Booooooooooooo.  Combat = lag = unreliable or slow mouse
movement.  If we can hotkey it though, all will be good.

Another "Yay!"  OK, I kinda like the idea of being able to improve a skill
over time, but I like it that at no point will any high level warrior wind
up with a 0-level skill.

Oooo...  Nice on both counts.

Egads... My warrior has to think now.  My days of "just get out there and
have fun hacking" combat are over.  ::sobs::  :D

Also nice.  If I wanted to hit that many keys I'd be a bard.

Woooo!

WOODY!

I think I like this.  It brings a lot more flexibility to tweaking the pure
meleers.

I think having more strategic decisions won't necessarily make a meleer
stronger.  Speaking just on warriors--their main ability, their key role, is
to be a meatshield.  To take and mitigate damage.  They've been nerfed by
default as other classes have had their agro abilities increased in order
for them to be more desireable, until where knights (light or dark) are
considered preferable in many cases.

If you greatly increase their taunt, and bump their mitigation up, you make
them once again the best meat shield in the game--as originally intended.  I
see it as really being that simple.  Warriors have always been a simpler
class to play--no spells to memorize, few special attacks, you carefully
choose your weapons, you get in there, you time your taunts, you do your
job.  For me, that makes them fun.

But, again, I think the new abilities will be worthwhile.  I just think that
the core problem--poor taunt--should be fixed, not glossed over.  When a 50
Warrior can't taunt off a 40 Ranger, there's a problem.

Yay :)

I wonder if this is a good time to go buy a bunch of cheap low-delay weapons
(and STA gear) in the Bazaar in hopes of them going up in value...

I am in LOVE with that.  In LOVE.

More yay :)

Mixed feelings.  On one hand, this means I'll know our Warrior is taunting,
and Warriors will no longer have to go, "I have BEEN taunting, stop bugging
me!"  On the other hand, you know there's gonna be people going, "Warrior!
Taunt more!  I can see you're not!"  Damned backseat drivers.  If anyone
tries that with me I'm gonna say, "Cleric, cast more!  I can see you're
not!"

Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.


All in all...  I'm gonna have to wait and see.  There's promise here, but
without fixing the core problem, I'm apprehensive as to how well the bells
and whistles will really fix things.  Or not.
