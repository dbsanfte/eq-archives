not to mention the more they hammer on it, certain people will continue 
out of sheer cussedness. ever babysat a terrorist two-year old? tell 
them no, and they will turn around and do whatever they are forbidden to 
do. keep telling them no, and they will keep doing it until you apply 
some not-PC correction.

me? i prefer top posting, most of my NGs encourage top posting. as i 
said before i am not going to change my posting style for one 
newsgroup...and the more they hammer on it, the less likely i am to feel 
like bottom posting. if i get kill filed, oh well...i have gotten more 
than enough private emails complimenting me on posts that they only saw 
in reply and being told that they took me off their killfile due to my 
content and other posting aspects.
aru
and as i have said many times, i cut everything except the specific part 
i am replying to every chance i get, so it is not particularly hard to 
tell what i am referring to.
