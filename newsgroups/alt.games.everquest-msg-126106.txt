Someone else who admits to going to Kerran Isle !
I have been soloing levels with my enchanter ther, by doing the warff
rats and the tooth quest. This is very eay and fast xp for levels 14
through to 18. The rats are dark blue or white for most of the time. You
get 3 kills plus the quest xp all with a 20% bonus. Very fast. (You can
also kill fish if you get down time). The problem here is zero loot, but
you can soon stock up with cash in the warrens.
(My chanter is now level 18 has all his spells and is a master jeweler)

However now that Im 18 the rats are lt blue and the xp is slowing down.
So I'm thinking of killing cats insted.
The pumas on the small island in the lake look like the right level
(17-19)
Does anyone have any experience of these ?
According to alakazim's they give kerran faction hits, but I can't see
why I would go back there other than to hurt my faction further <G>

Cheers,

Jim
