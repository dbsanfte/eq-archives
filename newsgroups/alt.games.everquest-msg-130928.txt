If this is true then the trick would be to find out when he's killed, then
log on 15 hours later, stay on 5 hours, go on with your life, repeating
in 13 hours.  I say 15 and 13 because that puts you in position an hour
before possible spawn time so you can claim the spawn fairly safely,
although you may miss out when some "I'll stay on for three days running"
fanatic logs in.  Heck, if they want it that bad let them have it after all
you've been trying for a year and a few more days won't hurt.
