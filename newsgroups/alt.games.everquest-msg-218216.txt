On this point, I agree with you.

I don't think EQ tradeskills are horrible.  But I do think they
need more work.  I base this on personal experience and the
seeming lack of experienced tradeskillers in EQ.  Fortunately EQ
has plenty to offer besides tradeskills.

That is a reasonable (though just barely!) "real life" justification
for the loss of components from a failed combine.  The justification
is excellent for some tradeskills (like baking & cooking) and probably
not so good for others (like tailoring).

Sometimes certain game mechanics just plain need to be there for game
balance.  Inventing a "real life" justification is an interesting
diversion but not necessary.
