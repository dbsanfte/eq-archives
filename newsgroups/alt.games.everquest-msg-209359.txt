For me, the best Tier 1 exp group is:

Paladin (me)
Shammy 58+
Ranger (Puller)
3 mages/rogues

While the ranger is pulling, the shammy can canni away with the paladin 
healing.

With a decent mana pool the shammy should have no problems doing heals 
and slows.

I had this group at NC in PoD, and we tore the place up.
It was just as well SC wasnt camped because NC cleared pretty damn fast.
