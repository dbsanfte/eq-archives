I think this is to address the issue of friends playing on different servers. 
I started on Rathe with someone who later dropped out of the game.  I moved to
Tunare to join another friend and have always been playing catch-up ever since.
 Had there been a means to move my characters from Rathe to Tunare I would have
done it.

This may also be to allow those on the PvP servers who dislike the upcoming
rules to get out while they can.
