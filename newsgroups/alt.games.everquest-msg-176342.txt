It could be argued that having only one character encourages a more
realistic virtual world. Having more than one character is like having
multiple bodies to slip in and out of as the spirit moves. Even in a fantasy
story, that's highly irregular. If you have only one life to live, you may
live it more thoughtfully. (Not thoughtful as in "nice" but as in with
careful thought.) This ties in with the already mentioned "you live and die
by your reputation" remarks. I think one of the goals of the RPP server
would be to create a more true sense of a complete world populated by unique
characters and allow a suspension of disbelief -as opposed to a bunch of
people openly playing a computer game.
