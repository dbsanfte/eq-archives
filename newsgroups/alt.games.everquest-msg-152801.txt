Sounds like a system that COULD run EverQuest very easily.  But I was
thinking more on the lines of a driver issue? Have you updated the drivers
for the video card and sound card (if possible)?  If not, that's what I
would first recommend. As for the GeF2, that should have been able to handle
it and there was no need to go GeF4. But now that you DO have it KEEP it!  I
don't know what the exact solution would be as I don't have the equipment,
but those guys told you wrong is all I know.
