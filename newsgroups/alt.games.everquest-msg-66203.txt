   I like 'em too.  Even better now that they've been
slowed down.  The way they move they look like they're
ready to fall apart at any second.  Very nicely done.
    I also love the look of my mage's pets.  But
the level 12 ones are pretty small, about gnome size
I'd say.  I wonder if they get bigger as I get older?
Can't wait to find out.
