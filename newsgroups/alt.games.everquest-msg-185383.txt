Y'all make me feel so much better! My main is only 30, my two alts are
24 and 26 and that's after almost 3 years of play.  I did have a main
that I deleted after he hit 18, so that was the first six months of
play.  He was a wimp and deserved to die.  I have one alt on a
separate account, so I can group two together, usually the Ranger and
the Mage these days.
