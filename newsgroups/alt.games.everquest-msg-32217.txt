I had heard this, so I included the disclaimer at the end ( see above ).
But, I do have several slots that are banded mail ( rest are Bronze or FP
and chestpiece is the Scarab piece ).  Unfortunately, I'm at my weight limit
all the time because I'm carrying around several weapons, trying to get my
skills up.  Bronze seems to be a bit heavier than banded, so I'm should
probably wait until I get my weapon skills up - and can drop off some of
these weapons in the bank - before getting any more bronze.  I had to remove
my 2 +2 dex rings and put on the +2 str rings because of the weight problem.
Yuk.  I traded a Stein of Mogguk last night for a Great Sarnak Cleaver and
some Black book with silver somethingorothers.  +4 INT and +30 mana, I
think.  I may sell the Cleaver and use that money for some Bronze and just
deal with the weight problem.  Is bring 3-5 stone overwieght a huge problem?

I'm also going to try to do the easiest crafted piece(s) with my Chanter and
a friend.  Those look like nice pieces, for sure.

This world of the Warrior is an interesting one, no doubt!  A lot to worry
about as opposed to "What robe and what hand / range slot items".
