A little OT here, but how about that crap UBI-soft just pulled with
URU (the single player/ONLINE MYST game they just released). ONe of
the SELLING points of this game was the online portion. Just a few
months after release, theyve canned the whole online part of the game.
Those that bought the game anticipating playing this stupid thing
online just got the shaft. Talk about lawsuit bait.
