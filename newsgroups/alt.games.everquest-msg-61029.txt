The quest in Felwithe gets you some minor experience, faction you
probably don't need right now (and can improve later, if you do) and
an item worth a couple of silvers. The same quest in Kaladim will give
you substantially more experience, faction with the dwarves and
usually an item worth a gold or two. Pretty easy choice, really.

Note - when in Butcherblock, avoid anything that even looks like an
ogre. Corflunk and Zarchoomi are the bane of starting characters
trying to get from Greater Faydark to Kaladim.
