Speaking of live frogs, I continue to be astonished by the number
of Froglok PCs who might as well be playing Trolls.  Most of the
the toons I've seen killing live frogs in UGuk have themselves

surprise tho, EQ has always encouraged nominally "good" characters
to embrace the dark side, with very predictable results.
