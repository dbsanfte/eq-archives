The MacroQuest plugins advertised in the above post are not open source.
The abilities are not a feature of MacroQuest.

It is true that IF you get caught you will be banned for use of 3rd party
software, which you shouldn't have to be made aware of considering you agree
to the EULA which you say you have read every time you start the game.

If you are subtle about your useage of the available goods, then you will
not get caught.  I have been using the software for 4+ years, and never once
was I banned.

Best regards!
