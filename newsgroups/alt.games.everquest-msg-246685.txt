My Erudite Magician (lvl 47 now) tried some melee with the underbulks
of Echo Caverns. Naturally he took a serious beating of 600+ damage
(trying for defense and a bit of melee skill ups) before backing off
and letting pet finish the fight.

Timed his HP regen. It started off at 6 HP / tick, after one minute it
was 9 HP / tick, and every minute after that it went up: 18, 27 (at
which point he was healed).

My Human Ranger (also lvl 47) and heavily buffed with Virtue and a
bunch of other buffs (thanks MGBers) had about 3400 HP (normally about
1400) and melee... meleeed... mele... fought the underbulks too. After
doing several he was down quite a bit so I timed and checked the HP
regen and did not use Heal. The regen progression was the same as the
Magician with the addition that the Ranger's regen hit 36 (he had more
HP damage to heal). It may have even hit 45 though that was near the
end and I missed it if it did.

AFAIK neither of the characters had any HP regen hardware or spells on
them. This was all sitting regen in case that wasn't obvious.
