It helps any class that will weild procing weapons.  Ask a Warrior if
he thinks procs are important.  If you aren't raiding AOE mobs and you
aren't tanking, HP is not as important since your main role is doing
damage.  Your experience may differ but a lot of people spend most of
their time in this situation.  It seems to have a large effect on
criticals, important for all melee later on.  It helps skillups as we
all know, important when you hit 50 or so and remember that you should
have worked on that 2h skill, 1hs skill, or whatever.

I wouldn't say dexterity is exactly useless for monks, warriors,
rogues, paladin, and SK's.
