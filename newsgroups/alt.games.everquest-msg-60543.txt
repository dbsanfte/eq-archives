Unfortunately, I can attest that he is correct.  Gate/run are useless when
your raid gets wiped, if you do that, sure you don't lose the exp you
would if you died, but you are no longer in position to res the fallen.  The
last thing any self respecting cleric is going to do is gate out of a raid.

The cleric who camps out successfully either did so when the bad pull first
happened, or had very good defenders who purposefully sacrificed themselves
pulling things off  his LD body.  Why?  Clerics heal, which adds hate to
every mob around.  The mobs chew thru whatever is higher on their lists
fairly rapidly if the cleric stops healing, and guess who they go to next?  Too,
healing hate is based on points healed, guess which class does the most
of this?  Paladin may have done one LOH, while the cleric may well have
done ten times that much healing even if he isn't down near OOM when the
word comes to camp.

The paladin, on the other hand, has done relatively little to gather mass hate,
probably only has the serious attention of the principle target.  If he quits out
at the same time as the cleric, he is far more likely to survive the minute or so
standing there getting beat on, even if HP and AC are the same as the cleric's,
because he probably isn't being beat on by much... heck, if nothing else, first
they all have to kill the cleric!

If there was some way to quit out and have DA go off about 20 seconds later,
instead of having to activate it immediately (when most of the raid is still
alive to provide distraction) then the odds might be reversed.
