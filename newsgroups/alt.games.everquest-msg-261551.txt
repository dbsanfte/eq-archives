I don't have EQ Platinum ... got EQ Evolution and the key was on a label 
stuck to the CD fold-out case ... should be clearly marked as account key. 
If you can't find the key I'd get in touch with where it was ordered from 
(Sony in your case) and get them to either mail you a key (not sure if they 
do that or not) or return it and get them to send you a replacement.

Hopefully they'll just mail you a key ... quicker and easier for all 
concerned I'd think
