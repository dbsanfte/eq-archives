Yeah, newbie servers are a waste. Lots of people want one to "start
fresh", which lasts a couple months. At around $27,000 or more per
server set of computers, that really doesn't make for a good
suggestion at a budget meeting.

There are tons of underused servers, a new transfer server's use is
hopefully getting people on the more crowded ones to transfer. It
makes sense.
