Every few days I seem to recall being forced to click on I Agree a couple
times...I'm PRETTY sure one of those annoying pop-ups are the rules.

What really annoys me is that every time you start the gameyou have to click
on the stupid CD-key window.  WHY?   I have 2 accounts, 2 different CD
numbers.  Only one of them is entered on that window between the 2
computers...the same number.  So if it's some fraud protection it ain't
working...get rid of the stupid window. :p
