Damn. I wish we'd had this conversation 6 levels ago... *g*  I /ooc'd 
asking what they were for since you can't sell the stupid things, but the 
only answers I got were "you eat them" (ewww) and "they're for some 
shaman quest, dunno which"

Other shaman quests - turn in polar bear skins to the woman in the kilt 
place, take the pack the woman in the warrior guild gives you, combine 
goblin ice necklaces (common drop even on whelps) in it and hand it back 
- both get you cash and more (armor from the polar bear skins) - also I 
concentrated on killing skellies (click on em first so you don't 
accidentally face a vengeful soloist :) ) and spiders because the silks 
and the bones both bring in a silver or more each, plus the skellies 
carry some weapons worth up to a gold or two each.  Since each spell is 
only a few gold each, they're fast earned.  Of course, with the above 
quest that's all fairly pointless now :)  But still.  I also kill the 
gnoll pups and goblin whelps - they're often very worth it - I've picked 
up dozens of containers off of them (ranging from belt pouches to large 
bags), drinks worth up to a couple silver each, weapons ditto, rations, 
the occasional iron ration and most of them carry at least a few copper 
each on them.  Plus you're upping faction for other areas while you're at 
it.  That's what I do with other newbie chars too.  Rats and snakes and 
bats are fairly useless, as anything they're carrying isn't worth the 
weight :p
