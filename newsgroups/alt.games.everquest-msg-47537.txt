Ho-hum.

Been playing EQ for nearly 2 years now. When I think about it, I'm
astonished it's kept my interest for so long. Especially when I consider
what is wrong with it, game-wise. It makes your life difficult from the
start. The controls and interface are clumsy and not intuitive. Poxy
computer generated sprites invariably outstrip the character you pour
precious hours of your life into in ability from around level 8 (without
serious twinking). It's tedious getting around by yourself, the zones
(especially the expansion zones) are too large and for no particular
reason other than to give you a fleeting sense of wonder as you stumble
across them for the first time. After that, it becomes a chore. You can
get friends and hire people to transport you, but I don't particularly
enjoy bothering people for things that ought to be trivial; I'm paying
to be entertained. Treks across miles of land aren't challenging,
they're boring.

Still, I have done quite a fair bit. Slain countless enemies, including
Dragons, Giants and Gods. Travelled, quested, and acquired a small
fortune in equipment in money. There's still lots of things I could do,
but the pointier weapons have lost their charm, and the armour it's
lustre. The game has taken up far too much of my time and energy.
Several times now I've stayed up well into the morning of the next day,
just to further the causes of myself and my friends and comrades.

Ah... my friends. The people I encounter. It's the people that transform
this game from a Sisyphean 3D Pacman into an enrapturing social
smorgasbord. Arbitrarily enforced community or not, the people in EQ is
the biggest hook.

That said, no game should cause you to think while trying to have a good
time "I'm wasting my life." No game should put such unreasonable demands
on it's players' time for the return it gives.

I haven't played for weeks. Think I'll log in to help with a plane raid,
and see how I feel. 

Have fun.
