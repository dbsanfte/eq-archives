Yeah, cause "we" are all so much summer than you.

There you go again with your nonsense.  By and large laws do not
protect *groups*, they protect *everyone* against certain forms of
discrimination.  You must  have swallowed the anti-PC rhetoric to
believe this despite your inability to show any argument why this is
so.

A blanket statement banning all forms of discrimination might work on
Sesame Street, but this is the real world- such statements are
unenforceable and inadequate.  The only practical method in our
society is to support the blanket statement with specific statements
listing the types of discrimination seen as particularly problematic
in our society, and make that list as comprehensive as possible.
