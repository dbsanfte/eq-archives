Chill out guys. He was just a kid who wanted to know if he could get
something for free, than otherwise he would have to pay for. Just
because you shelled out your money for the game and didnt get it for
free does not mean that you cannot simple answer him with a "no, its
not possible, because of X Y and Z". I mean, if it was possible, I
would do it because these guys are making plenty of money anyway. Who
gives a crap if one player does not pay. 

Either way, just realize he was looking for a self-serving and
money-saving method of playing. Nothing wrong with that.
