Is this really true?  Sure, a brand new EQ player couldn't "compete"
with a twink, but they really don't have to compete.  And  in some
sense newbie players have it easier than they did before.  Lots of
really good gear is now available in the bazaar far cheaper than it
ever was in the past.  At the higher levels where a mob can kill you
with one swipe people may get picky about your gear, but I bet up to
level 40 people don't have to buy plat just to be able to play.
