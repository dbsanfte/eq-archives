He said "not ...the best BY FAR", not just plain "not the best".

What he means is, its only 5% better than chanter slow, only 10%
better than beastlord slow (and beastlord is an ungodly powerful
hybrid, you'd think they'd have a slow equivalent to what the
other ungodly powerful class [cough*bard*cough], gets), so he
wouldn't use the modifier "by far" to describe the degree to
which it is the best.

Or else my special lucky Faned runed orb of mind reading is on
the fritz again.
