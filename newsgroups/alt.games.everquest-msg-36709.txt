    There's even more ahead for me. I'm still 59 now, but a third of my gear
dates from when I was 26th. I have sets of quest gems for all Velious pieces
except boots and BP (and I have the first CFE for the boots), I have the
fourth prayer shawl, all threads, and no trade skill below 156, I have no
epic, I've only raided Kael once (briefly). When I hit 60 I plan to apply to
one of the top guilds that has been asking about me, and just go nuts until
SoL (assuming small screen isn't eliminated in SoL). There's just so much to
do, and so little time to do it!

    That, I can't say. I love most of my alts. Playing them gives me
insights into concerns and abilities I otherwise wouldn't know about, and
that makes me a better cleric. If the group starts to wonder "how can we
accomplish X", I know what they can and can't do and that helps a LOT. It's
also good for making jokes with folks, to keep them happy and at ease. All
gnomes in plate helms should be hailed and asked where the Pillar of
Commerce is at least once. ;-)

    Yes.
