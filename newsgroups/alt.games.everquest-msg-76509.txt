Started a halfling just for the heck of it, and it seems I can't even move
in Rivervale without massive amounts of screen lag.  Everything jerks around
so bad, even when I'm inside a building, but especially outside.  It goes
away if I look at the ground, but the moment buildings or sky enter my view,
bam, my computer can't handle it anymore.

My other character was a dark elf, and I know Neriak can't have been THAT
much visually simpler than Rivervale, but there was no screen lag at all
there.  Any ideas what I might be able to do to fix this?  Maybe change some
settings?

Thanks

Gornul
