During the height of the plat production by the macroers, I was selling
spiderling silks for 25 each. The nerf on the drop rate pushed the prices
up, so the market responded, more people farmed, and the price dropped.

I remember about a year and a half ago, when a pair of monks wanted a port.
They said they had no money to donate. I said that I would have found a few
spiderling silks a good trade. They laughed, saying that such things were
beneath them, and i left them to their leetness. At level 56, I farm them
sometimes. Zero risk, easy to get, a bit dull but either they sell or
leather padding does (was getting 70 pp each on leather padding for a bit
but that's dropped back <40; not bad for an item that costs a few gold to
make if bought from a vendor).
