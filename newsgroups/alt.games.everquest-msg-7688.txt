Why? I have no intention of playing against other players every day. It was
just something that our guild decided to do for fun ONE day. There was one
guy that that really liked the PvP stuff. He was this really K3Wl D3Wd that
liked to sit on the side of the arena and wait till there was a fight going
on...then he'd jump into the middle of it when it was almost over and kill
both people and exclaim himself as the king...

Oh yeah...I wanna play on a server filled with people like that...
