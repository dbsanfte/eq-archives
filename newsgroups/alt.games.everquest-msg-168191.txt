Spell descriptions suck *in game*.  I depend on eqcastersrealm to explain "what
does what".
I spent an embarassing number of levels thinking "haste items" made you run
faster.  I had no need of that as I could cast sow.
There are a hundred other examples of game intricacies that aren't explained
well.  Verant really should add more information "in game".  Some people don't
realize there are newsgroups and websites devoted to EQ, (luckily I figured
*that* out around level 12).
