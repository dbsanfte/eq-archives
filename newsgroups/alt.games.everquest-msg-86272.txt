As a level 25 Iksar Beastlord I can understand how Pet Control can be
an issue. The main problem is that a Beastlord has no business being a
Tank. Period end of story. I have tried it several times and each time
has been tragic. When a Beastlord has to PULL and get a monster to
follow him to the Group he will usually tell his pet to "Guard Here"
near the group, however, as the Beastlord pulls in monsters and a
monster hits him, even if it misses the Pet comes running. Hence you
have a Beastlord and Pet in the middle of a nasty area fighting. This
happened to me when I was grouped on the Ledge in the Sarnak fort and
happened to be the tank and we did not have an Enchanter. I would pull
one Sarnak, it would follow me then hit me as I got outside the door
and my pet would jump him there. As we would fight, more and more
Sarnaks would jump in and kill the group. Thats why I refuse to go to
the ledge without a Warrior pulling, and an Enchanter to help quell
the trains that sometimes do follow. Lets face it, I dont care how
careful you are you will eventually pull more than 1 or 2. If all is
played right I target the Warrior when he brings the monster out and
hot-key ASSIST for me, and ATTACK for my PET, and then everything
flows normally. I have yet to die when a proper group is formed this
way.
