You are a fool who doesn't know how or what to quad.

Add unwilling to explore your possibilities.

I do more damage per tick than a druid by FAR. I don't stop killing
until I run out of mana or run out of mobs. I can kill over twenty,
maybe over thirty before I run out of mana; ensnare once and panic
animal half a dozen times tops doesn't run someone down very fast. My
tracking is better and I never have to stop.

WATCH a ranger who knows what they are doing in action before you
expose your considerable ignorance for all to see.

P.S. I have considerably more experience than you with both ranger and
druid. You are wrong. Period.
