Not really...zoning only involves about 40k of download, if I recall
correctly.  There was no noticable change in my zoning time when I
went from 1280 mb/sec down, 1024 mb/sec up DSL to 56k modem, nor when
I went from 56k modem to 128 k ISDN (really 110k because of my serial
port), and I expect no change next week when I get 144k IDSL.  Zoning
only involves a few seconds of data from the net, even on a modem, and
that seems to be overlapped with loading the zone information from the
disk and processing it.

As long as you use serverside filters on raids and in EC (or whatever
is your server's auction zone), the net is rarely a bottleneck.
