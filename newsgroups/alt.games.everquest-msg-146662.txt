Wow doesnt seem that long since i was asking you guys for advice on what 
to kill at lvl 22 and you were spot on with paludal caverns.
Awesome place.
Anyhow i am now level 26 and not gaining as fast there on the 
recondites.
At the moment im killing the picklaw goblins in highkeep which seems 
good but i was wondering if anyone could recommend any other places to 
advance for a level 26 erudite wizard solo and grouped?
I also tried the tentacles in nagena but that seemed to require too much 
micro management due to the timings of the guards and slow spawn times 
too.

thanks
