You could have a necro summon you, but it's probably easier to just ask a 
bard to kite Wuoshi away and either swing back to drag your corpse and run 
like hell for Kael, or have another guildie run up and drag your corpse 
while the bard takes Wuoshi for a tour of WL.
I have sucessfully ported into Wuoshi, without Selos memmed, and been able 
to mem, sing, and run away before being killed.  Since I discovered that I 
take Wuoshi for a run whenever I see him.  :)

Arolpin
I'll solo him eventually
