	This is not correct.  Harmony had a lot of limitations to it, most of them
related to buggy pathing, LOS and world geometry.

	Actually, as I said, I've expected this for some time.

	Their claims are, in fact, complete nonsense.  I doubt the devs who made
the decision ever used the spell.

|Rangers who do EW evil dorfs are gonna be hard hit, but you know, that camp

	Because it's outdoors.  Because it's one camp out of thousands, the vast
majority of which are either indoors or can't be Harmony-pulled due to various
issues.  Because Monks shouldn't get their panties in a wad because someone
can do their job just as well under very limited circumstances.

|Nobody else had a foolproof 100% reliable and safe way to pull,

	And neither did Rangers.

|druids/rangers are getting nerfed... I fail to see how/what you can whine

	For three years, outdoor pulling has been a Ranger strong point.  Removing
Harmony takes that away.
