The reason that all items in EQ go down in price is because of the
permanence of all items (exept, of course the expendable/limited usage
items).  This is the single bigest problem (if it can be called a problem)
of the EQ player driven economy.  I really do like the idea of an item
degrading over time.  It seems that a timer could be added to each item from
the time it was made/found and over time it could lose it's effectiveness.
Yes, I know that would require a huge undertaking of programming (the
database side should be fairly easy unless the records have no spare fields)
and will not be done for EQ, but I do feel it should be looked at for EQ 2
(if and when)...
