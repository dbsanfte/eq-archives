Lol, at least clerics can get on a list.  First of all we need to be lucky
to actually get to the mobs that have our items for the epic.  God knows
EVERYONE loves a mage on a raid :P.  Secondly, there are loads random spawns
that get kill stolen like crazy.  Quillmane, ect..  I'm sure you hear all
the time people getting on lists to kill him.  Oh, and the PoA stuff that
can be sold?  Do you have any idea how many people camp that just to sell it
to mages at god awful prices that the average mage can't even come close to
affording?

I'm sure every class has problems getting their epic, but guess what, if it
was easy there'd be no point now would there???
