There's a perfectly good soulbinder in PoK. The 10 seconds it takes to get
to one of the banks is hardly going to make a dent in your efficiency.
There's really no excuse not to bind outside the dungeon (if a binding
class) or at the wayfarer camp (if non binding). As far as getting back to
PoK is concerned, use the Magus and head to EC for the Freeport book.
