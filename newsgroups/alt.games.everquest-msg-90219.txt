1) More zones that are great for pick-up groups like OT and DL to
name two.  Zones with multiple relatively safe spots to pull to that
have good pathing and plenty of stuff to kill.  No I don't want a
no-risk game but a few more zones that are great for this kind of
thing especially that will take a person beyond 50 would not hurt
IMO. I am unable to do the moon as yet due to frame rate issues for
me still.

2) I would like to see is the ending of the AE group thing. I have
been in them before and the XP is amazing, but to me getting there
is most if not all of the fun. Once to 60 the fun kind of dies a bit
to me, I guess I am addicted to hearing that DING! hehe.  I am not
sure how to deal with it really.  Maybe just take AE damage spells
out of the game, and replace them with something else.

The last thing that I think would be the ability for a departure
from the dream group.  Make it so that you can have nearly any
combination of characters to hunt in at least some zones so long as
you have a healer class of any type and any melee.  Maybe there
could be a "full group bonus" added to certain classes AC, damage,
or heals in some zones.  I have no idea how this could be done, but
I am no programmer.

This is not a rant I love the game just a few things that I thought
of and figured I would post to see what the learned here think.
