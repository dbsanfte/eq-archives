Yeah, but this has gotten *seriously* bad. I don't know how "addicted"
the rest of you are, but I've gotten to the point where I even *dream*
about EQ. Almost constantly. And in the rare dreams I have where I'm
*not* a troll warrior, and I'm in the normal world, my dreams have a
scrolling text box at the bottom. It's scary. My wife dreams about it
too. We used to laugh about that, but now it's just disturbing.
  When I'm not logged in, if I'm at a computer (even at work) I'm either
camping this group, or other eq related boards, or researching multiple
eq sites to find out about the next zone I'm going to, what equipment I
can get, etc. The amount of time I've spent just trying to figure out
how I can squeeze out six more points of AC without giving up too much
in resist stats is.......... frightening. I really need to walk away for
a while.

My latest book type addiction is Jonathan Letham. (sp?) Author of "Gun
with Occasional Music" and "Amnesia Moon", which are the two of his I've
read thus far. He has another called "Girl in Landscape" which looks
really promising, along with some others. If you've never read him, give
one a try. I particularly enjoyed Gun and have reccomended it to many
friends. (Well, back when I used to be able to have conversations about
anything except EQ, that is.)
