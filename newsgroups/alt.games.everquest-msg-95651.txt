If that was true nobody would ever play any class other than a halfling for
druid. Your 'messed' up druid still started with 20 base points of wisdom more
than me (half-elf) and i'm having a blast.

Do you start over? Well that's up to you, Do you want to go through those first
29 lvls all over again? Are you enjoying playing as you are? 

If you want to be the best of the best (as your guild is telling you) then
start anew and pump all your points into wis. 
If not tell them to stick it where the cleric can't rez it and find people to
play with who appreciate having you around for what you can offer.

Yes, with less wisdom than some it might get a bit expensive to keep up but
with the amount of wisdom gear out there Druids NEVER have a horrible time 
regardless of lvl.

Play it and enjoy it for what "you" get out of it, not for some 15 year old
d00d who thinks he knows it all.

I don't care what is written about me so long as it isn't true.
