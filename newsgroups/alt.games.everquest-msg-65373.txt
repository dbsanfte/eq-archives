Give the man a cigar.  That sounds like your best bet by far Jazz.  It
should work OK, you might have to change the BIOS settings, but probably
not.  Be sure to remove your current video drivers first, shut down your
system, remove old card, install new PCI card, boot up, install new drivers.
So long as your PCI slots are standard, you should be fine.  Once again,
good luck with this.
