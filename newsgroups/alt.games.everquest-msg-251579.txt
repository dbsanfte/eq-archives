Tell you what, if you pay me enough I'll come to your house, eat your 
food, and play your character for you, too. That way you won't have to 
play the game, which seeing as you don't want to get your platinum 
pieces by playing the game, it seemed likely that you are lazy, and you 
probably really don't want to put in the effort to level your character, 
make friends, or find equipment either.

Please provide a good system on broadband, I don't care for lag.
