No not After all that...... and you are obligated to no one in this
game... the "obligations" are self imposed.
I wont pretend to be the best person to follow a thread back.
I must have missed all those "AFTERS" in the original post.  

Its a little common sense....    Would you want to be left in a
dungeon?  Now, If I was there and there was someone complaining about
an issue with another... I will speakup for the the one I "THINK" is
correct....

Good day
