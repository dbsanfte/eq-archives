???  Then would not enchanters be the best "healers" of all with their
mezzes?  Forget slowing a group of monsters down.  Charm all except the one
that's being beaten on.  Allow every to rest up then move onto the next one.

Then again, possibly bards are the best "healers" of all with their speed
songs.  The quicker the kill, the less the kill can hurt you.

;-)

Humor aside, the kernal of truth behind is that I think you're mixing crowd
control and performance with healing.  I'm talking about being the best
healer.  Healer as defined as repairing the wounds (life loss) of others.

Sorry.  I get the barbarian and human mixed up a lot.  Look basically the
same ... to us Halflings.  :-)

Hmmm.  So what we cannot Complete Heal in time, we XP rez back?
