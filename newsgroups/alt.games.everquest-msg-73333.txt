I've ready several references to this, but not really sure I understand
it. The way I thought it worked was that people dueled to the death
before going in, and left a corpse and a cleric outside. Then, when the
raid was over, whether you needed more rezzing inside or not, the
outside cleric rezzes all the raiders back out to their first corpses.
Is that it? Because if so, doesn't that limit you to three hours of
raiding? How much can you get done in ToV in three hours?
