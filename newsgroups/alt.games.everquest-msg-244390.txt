I think the monk was far too powerful in the beginning.  He could do
insane damage comparitively and hardly got hit at all.  The monk could
tank better than any other class for quite a while.  Definitely not
the way it should have been.

Then they decided to nerf the monk to make the plate classes more in
line with where they should be.  But not only did the monk get nerfed
but most other classes were buffed.  So the monk really went down
hill.

I don't have any issues with this really since it's a cycle.  Every
class at one point or another has been low class on the totem pole
(except druid it seems) so whatever.

My real issue is this Beserker class.  All of the cool abilities of a
Berserker are what the monk shold have become.  Critical hits?  Shots
that can reduce atk and speed?  Come on, we've all seen Kung Fu and
how he could drop a guy with one shot.  Crouching tiger hidden dragon
anyone?

I guess what I'm saying is the Berserker never should have been made,
the monk should have recieved those abilities.
