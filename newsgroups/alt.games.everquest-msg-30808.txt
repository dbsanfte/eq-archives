Ok, judging from the responses I am getting, I worded my question poorly.

I know 24 languages, 13 of which I have mastered via player to player
lessons.  Every one of the languages I have mastered are languages that some
PC has mastery of as a natural ability.

Is there some other way to advance languages that no one seems to know
besides the guild trainers?  Sure, I could be patient and hope that I
stumble across some one who has mastered Gnoll (or whatever), and is willing
to teach it to me.  But it seems that someone had to be the first to master
a MOB language, who taught him?  Of course I am assuming that like trade
skills you can only put 20 points into it, or did someone really spend 100
points into Orc?

And yes, I know languages are useless.   Much like mountain climbing, I'm
doing it because it is there.

Thanks,
Frank
