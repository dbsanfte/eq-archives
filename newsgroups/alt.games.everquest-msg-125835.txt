Before we go totally off the beam, let's go back and look at the OP's
question, even if it was phrased in a bit of a muddy fashion.

"I understand what cancel magic is for (or at least I think I do).Would
you
be able to use it to cancel root or something.Lets say you buff your
self
then remove the top buff.Then while fighting a ghoul he throws a
grasping
root on you ,could you cast cancel magic on your self to disable the
spell?Or does cancel magic only work on buffs?"

Nobody said it wasn't a highly useful spell for support casters. He/she
is asking about casting it in battle, while being beat on, to get rid of
a bad spell hit from a low level mob. While it's possible to channel
through, your channeling at that level is low and the odds are poor. I
recall trying it. If I'm trying to channel anything at the point, it's a
gate.

You, my friend, are talking about the exception *far* more than the
rule.

You can be interrupted by getting "pounded on" by greens. Trust me on
this. (Faction hunting with my 46 wizard I found that out fast.) They
don't have to hit fast or any harder. They have a chance of interrupting
you, though I understand after the last patch, they have less chance of
casting on you if they are very green, which could help.

It's an interesting discussion, but sticking to the OP's question, no. I
would say wasting your time trying to CM a Ghoul Route rather than
gating is just going to net you a corpse run in the majority of cases.
You're time is better spent trying to finish them off or gating the hell
out of there.
