That's not entirely true. The Iksar Dreadscale armour etc has plate
look and is quite protective as well. The Iksar Plane armour is
mostly better than the non iksar one, and velious plate is wearable
by Iskar as well. In the end game, you will have *more* AC than
others, as you can wear most of plate PLUS the innate AC bonus an
Iksar has. I have no problems with my Iksar SK at all in the levelling
game and he's 33 now. Beisdes that, we can quest the cool Greenmist
weapon .. the rest can not, we have regen which is nice for a tank class
(I soloed up to 26 easily, with twink gear though).
