Bunk. I challenge you to find one person, anywhere in the North American
continent over the age of 5 that -doesn't- know for a fact that smoking
will kill you. I submit that this has been common knowledge for at least
the last 40 years.

And not a single one of those ad dollars got me smoking. Too many late
nights jamming with a band on hot summer nights got me smoking.

Again, bunk. I'd make an analogy here but all analogies suck so I won't
bother. Suffice to say, no one put a gun to my (or any other smokers) head
and told them to take a puff. Quite the contrary.

Bunk. It's not the advertising that gets the young. Get this misconception
out of the way and look at why the "young" smoke. It's the same reason
they drive too fast, get drunk, party all night, or take foolish personal
risks. (Like I did... every summer going out to your local river/quarry
and diving in off the rocks... we did it every year, even tho every year
one or two kids would break their necks. No one I knew, never gonna
happen to me of course...)

It's an Immortality Complex. "It" may be bad, dangerous, addicting,
self-destructive or down right stupid and you know what? They know it, and
they don't care. Because after all, they're teenagers and they're going to
live forever...
