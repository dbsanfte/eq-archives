It's not the snare part of Torpor that blows.   Thats merely annoying.
It's the melee combat slow component.  On a paladin or shadow knight they
can just cast a bit more (as long as mana holds out, I suppose)... but for a
warrior, losing your melee damage production is a *major* hit to your aggro
abilities.   You better be seriously well equipped in the aggro weapon
department if you want to maintain aggro while slowed.

Damage = Aggro.   It's that simple.   And dont' just say "Taunt a little
more"   Taunt doesn't work like that.
