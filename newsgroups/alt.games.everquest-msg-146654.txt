Thirteen governments [of the original states] thus founded on the
natural authority of the people alone, without a pretence of miracle
or mystery, and which are destined to spread over the northern part of
that whole quarter of the globe, are a great point gained in favor of
the rights of mankind. -- John Adams

The United States of America have exhibited, perhaps, the first
example of governments erected on the simple principles of nature; and
if men are now sufficiently enlightened to disabuse themselves of
artifice, imposture, hypocrisy, and superstition, they will consider
this event as an era in their history. -- John Adams
