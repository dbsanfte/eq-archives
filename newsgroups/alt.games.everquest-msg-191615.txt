Ding'd 55th yesterday, only taken me 3yrs and about 105days played, I was at
the same level for so long, players were beginning to think I was an NPC.

Bought a new toy to go with my level

Narandi's Lance
Damage 44
Delay 45
AC +8 Str +8 Sta +8 Wis +8 Int +8 Disease Resist +10 Mana +30 HP +30
Two Handed Piercing

(payed 9k for this so expect the price to fall sharply, now I have)

It's even possible I may start attending raids <gasp>. A friend has offered
the let me tag along WToV raids, for the more common armour drops. Incase
this happens, and keeping in mind I am a real newb when it comes to raids
any simple advice of things to do and not to do? Obviously at my level I'd
be little more than a passenger but I don't really want to put anyone in
danger making some stupid mistake.
