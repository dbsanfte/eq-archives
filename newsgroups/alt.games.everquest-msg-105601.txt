Hmm. Maybe it's a server thing. While there is mention made of "priest
classes" for purposes of distinguishing armor types, weapons, etc. I am
*far* more familiar with the terms "Int casters" and "Wis casters".
Don't they use those on Inny?

And if so, since you say "Yes shaman and druids are casters" I have to
wonder where a stupid phrase like "pure casters" (IF it only applies to
INT casters) came from? I mean, you have classes who's "core function"
is based on their ability to cast, others who are based on their ability
to beat the shit out of things, some hybrids who specialize in both, and
of course you Bards. (Who knows *what* the fuck you guys are.... lounge
lizards?) ;-)

But anyway, back to the latest nitpicking from Ben, no. I don't agree
that "pure caster" is a universally accepted and correct term for a
sub-set of the casters. And even if you do, it goes out the window on
almost *any* discussion because it includes the necros. In many ways,
they may as well be druids with Steroid charged pets, since they can do
a lot of the same things.
