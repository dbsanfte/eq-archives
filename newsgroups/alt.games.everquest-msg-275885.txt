If you're talking about Windows XP, that can be easily disabled.

I was looking through the archives for discussion about
speech-recognition for gaming. 

Earlier in this thread, no longer in my list of messages, 
you wrote: 

"As someone who has worked in speech recognition development for
example, I can tell you that Microsoft some time ago spent a great
deal of money hiring some of the best and brightest talent in that
area to work for them. But in the meantime, they have not shipped
anything worthy of note. In fact, I do not think they have shipped
anything at all. Meantime, Dragon Systems has released some very
impressive speech recognition software and has actually been doing
so for a good number of years now. Who would you call an innovator?
Dragon Systems who actually brought the power to create text
documents on computers to people who because of disability could in
no other way ever write? Or do you think that the Microsoft think
tank folks in the speech area should be called the innovators?"

I am using NaturallySpeaking. You are too right. You might not agree
with my further comments, but it's the naked truth. 

In fact, people with physical disabilities depend on such products.
Speech-recognition should be part of the operating system. In fact,
speech-recognition is no different than keyboard or mouse input to
someone who is severely disabled. Decent quality text to speech,
such as produced by Eloquent Technologies (now owned by
SpeechWorks), should have been included in Windows a long time ago.
In fact, people who are blind need text-to-speech like people who
are sighted need monitor output. Input and output are basic
operating system functions. Microsoft could not care less about
speech-recognition and text-to-speech because they serve a small and
usually poor population. Microsoft does not include them because
they do not either further entrench Microsoft's monopolies or make
lots of money. 

Microsoft and its average stockholders are pathetic, greedy
bastards. Bill Gates couldn't care less about the future of high
technology. History probably will remember him best as a monopolist. 

I'm not a professional programmer, but few know Windows as well, and
I know that input and output is a basic operating system function.
Speaking in degrees, input and output required by someone with a
disability just to use a personal computer is in fact basic compared
to an Internet browser, media player, or media editor (and so on).
