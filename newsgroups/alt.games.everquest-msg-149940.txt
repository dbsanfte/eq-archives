No, no, no.  That will just figure into their calculations.  There will
still be a day that is highly inconvenient for a major portion of the
players.  What is likely to happen, though, is that the first day back for
you will get an added "incinvenience factor" thrown in to the equation
resulting in a higher probability of a P-Day (Patch Day).  If they do have
P-Day on your first free day, we will know who to blame.
