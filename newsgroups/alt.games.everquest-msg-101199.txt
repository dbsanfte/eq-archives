Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. High and Mighty Wizard, I thank you for setting my humble
self straight.

Ok, then we'll put it in terms you can understand.  You'd rather let your
corpse exceed the rez time, because you want a 96% rez Damnit!, instead of

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.

--Megumi Hayashibara, Sakura Saku
