What if Honda actually made the best automobile to begin with? I would 
think they would gain a healthy market share as a result. Same could be 
said for Microsoft. Show me a better OS and by golly I'll jump to it. 
Ignore the little things that basically stem from personal preference, 
and find me one that performs the core functions of a computer so much 
better.

I see your point, I really do. In some cases, this monopoly *does* bring 
up some delicate issues. However, I don't see where we're having to 
settle for less here. My OS works fine.

I hope I am so successful with a business some day that the DoJ looks 
into whether I should be taken down a peg or two.
