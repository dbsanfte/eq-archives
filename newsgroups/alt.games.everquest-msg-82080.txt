  Sorry, not young -- 51 here -- just  don't put up with much stupid crap
anymore.

No, I do not work for Verant and know no one who does. I do a lot of stupid
shit myself, and I'll be the first to say so, and if you've been reading
this NG for very long, mate, you will already know that. As for help, when I
can, I give it. Otherwise I stand around and look dumm and bitch at people
about their grammar.

Give me a break.
