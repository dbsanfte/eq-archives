As I understand it, the hate you generate is based on the number of times
you hit the mob, or possibly, swing at the mob.  Hence low delay is good for
hate generation, high delay is good for hate avoidance.  There may also be a
component based on the amount of damage.  This is why you see Lances advice
above, and you will see the same advice from most high level players.  You
do definitely have to consider procs as well, as they can be a major
component in hate generated.
