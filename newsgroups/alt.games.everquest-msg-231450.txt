Wow.  I'm not being clear.  In both of these situations *I* was already in the
group when the Ignore-ee showed up and was invited into the group, and in both
situations the group was full with the Ignore-ee.  
If I joined a group and saw Ignore-ee already joined I would IMMEDIATELY
disband and send the GL a tell explaining.  No harm / no foul / end of story.

In situation 1:  The GL said he had played with Ignore-ee before and had no
problem.
In situation 2: The GL said we needed a full group and there were no others
available, (it was realllly early in the morning).  (Both GL's apologized later
BTW).
So, basically, the GL was prefering the Ignore-ee *over* me.  Which I guess, is
perfectly ok, and kinda answers my own question.  
I feel like it's unfair to the *rest* of the group to disband without
explanation and using /g to whine about someone who's already *in* the group
seems rude.  Perhaps something along the line of "/g I'm very sorry to have to
leave the group, but one of you doesn't do your job and puts the entire group
in peril because of it and the GL won't disband you so I must respectfully
leave the group".
Hmmm.. that doesn't sound so bad.
