I'm not speaking for Dan here, and Dan please correct me if I'm reading
this wrong, but I don't think he's implying that anyone coming here for
info prior to buying the game is a troll.  He is specifically refering
to a single case of someone saying that they are interested in the game
but really having ulterior motives.

Just wanted to underscore what I feel was his point lest someone take it
entirely out of context.  Again, please correct me if I'm not reading
that right Dan.
