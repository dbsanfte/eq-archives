I'll take it under advisement. ;D  Comments are actually welcome, but I've
accepted my own limitations of time and skill for now, so I can't act on
it. What you suggest would require I either do more than cut something out
of a screenshot, or go back and fiddle around with the 3-d views to get
the right kind.  I had to take about 30 screenshots to get one with the
darned mimic opening it's lid in the right amount.  Little bugger is fast!
