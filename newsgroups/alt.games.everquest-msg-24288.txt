Well...  From what I understand, /pause uses a tenth of second rating...
ie: /pause 10  is the same as saying pause for 10 tenths of a second.

Spells on the other hand have a casting time that uses SECONDS....

So...  If a spell has a casting cost of 2.5 you would need a /pause of 25.
But I usually got with a /pause that is 10-20 tenths higher than the
original casting cost...   To compensate for lag and other oddities....

Or am I wrong???
