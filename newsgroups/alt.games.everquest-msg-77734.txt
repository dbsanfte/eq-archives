Depends on your definition of 'best'. Best for levelling, questing,
having fun?

Ok, here's a suggestion that I KNOW will make people flame me, laugh
at me, etc etc. For a great duo having fun while still able to level
not too slow and (this is important) being independent I'd say: ... a
paladin and a ranger... *gasp*!

I know the flames and taunts are rolling in already, but stay with me
here...

Both classes are hybrids and are by no means anything special at all
individually.

Still, both classes can heal so your downtime will be small. Further
since both classes need to meditate from time to time you can do this
at the same time (as opposed to having the warrior get bored while the
cleric meds up). Both classes can tank so adds are not that dangerous.
Both classes can melee and (at least against undeads) cast so damage
output is ok'ish. Later on SoW will come.

In outdoor zones this duo will do great, tracking and killing blues
and whites with no effort. Further such a duo will be capable of
actually exploring the zones and not just wander from 'known xp-camp
A' to 'known xp-camp B'. The duo is NOT suited for dungeon-crawling
but few duo's are really.

/em prepares himself for a wave of flames
