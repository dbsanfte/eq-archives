You always have to go in groups of four... its just that someone
else who came to him before you may have not followed that
instruction.  He keeps careful track of what he's been given, and
not of who gave it to him.  So if Sarah came up to him earlier
and gave him one whisker, then when you come up and give him one
you get nothing, then Sarah might come give him another and still
get nothing, then you come yet again and give him one... and get
credit for being the person to hand in the fourth one, since he
wanted four.

Now assuming nobody else is involved, you will only get credit
for handing in four more, one at a time or seperately.  But lets
say instead of one you handed in four that last time.  Well he's
already recieved three, so he gives you credit for being
fourth... and then keeps track of three more hand ins.  If Sarah
comes back and hands in one more, then -she- gets credit for
completing that second four.

If you always hand in exactly whats been requested each time then
you never get screwed.  On the other hand, if you hand in one at
a time, its possible you can take advantage of someone else's
mistake, frequently someone who will think the quest is broken
and not try it again..

One way you can get screwed is by handing in the four items
requested as a single stack (one icon, with the number four in
the lower right corner).  Some quest givers will count that as
four, but some will count it as just one.  This means that even
if you handed in four you may get counted as just handing in
one... if you are lucky three other people made the same mistake
and you get paid, but this just trains you wrong, as do those few
quest givers who -do- count how many items in a stack.  Since you
don't know this oddity of EQ, getting rewarded (for either
reason) for doing it wrong just makes things worse, how are you
supposed to figure out why it works in one case and not in
another?
