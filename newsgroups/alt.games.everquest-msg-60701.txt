Not quite sure what you're trying to say here. But I was never twinked. I
bought
a series of better magic weapons from people and so by the time I went to
unrest
had suitable weapons to fight there.

Low end magic weapons are easily available. Have you tried auctioning for
them?
I know I have things like a RTS that I would never bother to auction off
because
the plat I would get for it is not worth the time it would take to sell, but
I saw
someone wanting one I might well think to sell it to them.
