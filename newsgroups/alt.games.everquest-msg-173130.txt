Hmm....Iraq is one of the most moderate/secular arab nations, and you havent
shown how they fund terrorism, in fact Bin Laden hates Saddam from all the
reports I have read.
No...I dont see the connection.
Saudi on the other hand, has a record of funding terrorism, funny they
werent the first to be bombed in the "War" on terrorism.

BTW calling me names does not make your argument any more persuasive, only
more childish (if it were possible for it to be more childish).
