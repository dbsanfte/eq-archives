Ok, more basic game mechanic questions:

Are hits locational or is it just a simple hit vs your AC and a generic 
damage number? (Basically I'm asking if it is like AC's damage system)

How is XP split up if more than one person fights a creature (not 
grouped)? Is it percentage based on damage? Does all of the XP go to the 
one that does the most damage? Or maybe the killing blow? Does level 
affect this?

How are loot rights granted? Most damage?

Does AC lower damage taken when hit or is it simply used to determine if 
you are hit or not? If not, what is used to lessen damage taken from a 
hit? Defense?

What affects my chances of hitting? Offense? My Attack number?

And finally (for now), is there any way of knowing what kind of XP you 
get for kills? Do different creatures give out different xp even if they 
con the same? (i.e. in the commons bears and spiders both con blue, do 
they give me the exact same xp?)
