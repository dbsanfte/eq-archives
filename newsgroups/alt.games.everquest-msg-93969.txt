OK without trying to start a flame war here over Legends versus regular EQ-
I've been on Legends since launch day (well....launch night, as it were).
Honestly, I'm having a GREAT time.  I have yet to see any new loot, though,
so I can't comment on that aspect of the service.  But in that time I have
been an erudite for a day so I could participate in an Erudin versus Paineel
PVP war, a Gnome for a Gnome versus  Dwarf PVP war (for both those vents, we
made new chars, then the GMs made us level 6) , attended a few Last Man
Standings in the LR arena to root for my felllow guildmates (we have won
both 1-30 Last Man's so far), battled a portal of skellys into loio, and
went to an event in the bazaar where GMs where they were having fun turning
people into as many random mobs as possible (appearance only change).  All
the interaction and content has been a blast as of now.  The fact that the
bazaar is being used as the trade zone makes me happy as well.  Also, I have
found *in my experience* that darn near EVERYONE on here is nice.  No
droods, no leets, etc. People are much more willing to help out, give a sow,
throw a few buffs.  I and myself like to go around to lower level areas and
hand out stuff for fun.. and lots of times other people are doing it too!
There is little to no arguing over camping issues (at least in the areas I
have been in)- great thing for someone used to hearing "spire check" in SK
every 2 minutes.   My only complaint thus far is in the economy.  There is a
TON of "uber" gear in the economy due to all the high level players, but not
much mid level (30-45 or so) gear being bought and sold.  This is because
the higher ups will sell their stuff to lower people, making the hunt for
more level appropriate gear pretty moot.  This seems to be making what mid
level stuff there is go up in price.  But other than that, I think it's fun,
and I'm having a great time.
