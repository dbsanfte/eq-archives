Hehe, hadnt even read the article, but sounds good they get their own 
servers.

Im probably generalizing here, but i get the feeling that most console 
owners (PS2 in this case) are the kids you see down in the arcades 
playing racing games and fighting games. Wont even think of how it would 
increase the newbie/moron population on the server if there were to 
rampage free on all servers :)
