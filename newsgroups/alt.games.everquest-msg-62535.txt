Well as a Ranger of 53 seasons here is the best advice I can give you.

Visit the Ranger Glade www.interealms.com/ranger/

any thing you ever wanted to know about being a Ranger can be found there.

As for where to hunt at level 14 to 15 ranger you can go to a number of
zones to get good Exp. As you have a healer willing to travel with you here
are some Ideas

Oldworld Zones
Bandits in Karanas | Gnolls in Highpass | Avaiks near the Arena in Lake
Rathe | NRo and or Oasis are also good hunting grounds

Kunark Zones
Lake of Ill Omen Has some excellent hunting for a duo around your level

Hope these tips help anyone who reads this
