Your interpretation is possibly valid, but in this case is incorrect.
If you needed to verify your assumption, you should have *asked* me.
Instead, you decided to assume the worst right away, and act on that.
Why?  To hurt my feelings?  What is your motivation?  If you answer
nothing else, please answer that question.  You spend a *lot* of time
being snide and offensive to people around here.  That's your perogative
but I'd really like to know the motivation.  People that have never even
spoken to you will get snide replies from you on a regular basis.  Do
you just enjoy being nasty?  I'd respect you more if you just said yes,
if it's the truth.  Some people get off on that, not that I like it, but
at least you'd be man enough to admit it.

*I* for one don't want tradeskills made too easy.  I don't think I
ever stated in no uncertain terms "tradeskills should be way easier!".
Instead I focused on the issue of 34% being an awful high failure
rate for an item you can't get skill-ups from.  If you can point out
where I clearly insisted I wanted a higher success rate, show me the
post, I don't think you'll find it.  You *will* however see me saying
that it would make more sense to continue to allow skill-ups when your
failure rate is that high, even if those skill-ups start coming more
and more slowly.

To anyone paying attention I think the issue has always clearly been
about skill-ups.

But I certainly *never* flat out said "I want a higher success rate!"
as you suggested.

: Just as I thought. Are you going to admit I'm right, or are you going
: to continue making a fool of yourself?

I was right about the "at least 33% failure rate thing", and you never
admitted you were wrong about that, after acting very obnoxiously about
it.  Where's *your* admission you were wrong and I was right?  Hmmm?
Double standard???

In this instance you're *not* right about my motivations for posting.
You foolishly *assumed* something, and you were wrong.  You can't crawl
into my brain to find out, regardless of how badly you want to, and how
badly you want to be right.  It's a bitter pill to swallow, but you're
just going to have to trust me on it.  Besides I think my posts make it
reasonably clear.  You'd have to take an obtuse approach to come to the
conclusion you did, but I think your brain prefers finding fault with
others, at least here.

: For the record, you attacked. Not me.

Follow the thread history all the way back.
