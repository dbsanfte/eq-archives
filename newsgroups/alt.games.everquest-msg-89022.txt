Well I see you said you tried all the things suggested.... does that
include turning of the HUMAN MALE Model?   I had a similar issue, but
once I turned off that model..> I was able to enter the game with no
issues.
If you have done that... It could have been a similar issue me and my
wife had.   It appeared that our connection to certain zones were
down.
We could not zone into Gfay, Nek, GD, and several other zones without
being dumped to Desktop.   
But I was able to get a friend to help our characters out of those
zones.... He lives in the same city as me but has a different ISP.

Just a heads up...
