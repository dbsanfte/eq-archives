    He may be able to solo, but I challenge the assertion that he solos
well. My gear is about as good as is needed to solo - 41% haste item, oodles
of HPs and AC, right-clickable damage shield for when I don't bring a
potion, weapon with proc rate slightly above that of the summoned hammer
(Withering Staff of Agony). I can pull multiple blues on myself and live
with ease even without doing some root-parking, and can take down mobs that
would kill most melees. But I can't kill stuff quickly, so I can't gain XP
quickly. No way around that. There is one area in the game where you can
semi-exploit with Turn Undead and gain three or four hour AA points, but
that's it. Even finding one warrior and healing them while they kill will
bring in faster XP than soloing, so why do it?

    Oh, and as an addendum: the Bane vs. Undead usually isn't much of an
issue when soloing, at least not at higher levels. Cleric skill caps are low
enough that our pathetic ATK rarely punches through the front AC on a mob
anyways, and if we're soloing that's what we're swinging at. We get a lot
more DPS out of damage shields and the hammer's proc.
