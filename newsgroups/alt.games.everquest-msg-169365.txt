What is your ram?The processor speed can be a gig but its your ram that
makes the "fast decisions".
If the computer was a butcher the freezer would be the processor you can
hold a lot of beef in the freezer but the chopping table(the ram)is where

condescending prick.If this doesn't help you Its your video card.But then
again what do I know.
