The perfect (I think) solution to this dilemma was posted here the other
day...  Take the xp loss, have yourself killed in the zone and do a corpse
drag to where you need the money to go.  You can always get xp back.  Unless
*every* NPC in that zone is non targetable for attack, you should be able to
find something to smack and get smacked back by...

Of course, since I will NEVER have that kind of plat, a horse is a non issue
for me anyway...  sigh...
