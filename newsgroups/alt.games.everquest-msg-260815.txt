sheesh, I dont bother flogging for donations, and in general if 
someone sends me a tell for a temp I just ask them to give me a 
dot if we are on pok so I am not using mine up...if we are out 
hunting, we are frequently in an LDoN or in a low population zone 
so I rarely get asked to buff. Can't think of the last time I 
really got given the first gem drop or first few gem drops in a 
group situation, my tradeskill and drop selling in bazaar 
normally takes care of my 4 or 5 stack a week habit =)

And I dont flog temp in bazaaar because if i am just going to 
stand somewhere I am going to be busy doing tradeskills and not 
want to stop to buff, or i am in my trade mule chatting with 
friends and selling=)
