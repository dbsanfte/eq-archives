A. Be bored.
B. Find someone juts as bored
C. Group with them, you all sit down to talk. Switch to group talk. Both
swithc to the languages you wanna learn the other person.
D. Make a hotkey with 5 lines of text.
E. Switch group talk OFF (MAJOR spam, you cant see anything else)
F. Sit down and press it for half hour.

Use emotes to communicate, since theyre not affected by language, so you dont
need to switch languages.
Note that the skill do NOT raise on your skill screen before you zone. So best
to do it near a zone line, and zone once in a while to see how good you are
getting.
Highest is now master (at 100, they changed it, before it still said Excellent
at 100, so you couldnt see if you were at 91 or 100 skill)
