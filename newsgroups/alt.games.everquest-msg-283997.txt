I've tried to duplicate the server-vs-UI thing, by casting at various
levels of mana, then "ducking" and I don't see anything odd.  Ducking
at between 10% and 40% (roughly) left the mana as it was at the start
of casting.  Maybe it's lag or something, but I'd think the
discrepancy on the UI can only be in the odd percentage or two?
