The absolute BEST place to practice Safe Fall is the teleporter up to the 
ledge at the back door of Erudin.  (right before the Tox zone)

If you aim it right, you can run up to the teleporter, appear on the ledge, 
jump off the ledge, practice falling on the way down, then hit the teleporter 
again and repeat the process.

Get a SoW and hold down the run key.  You'll bring Safe Fall up faster than 
any other way.  And you can just sit back and watch it happen!

One warning...  make sure your skill is high enough to make the fall from the 
ledge safely.  (Use one of the places mentioned above to get that high...)  If 
you take damage on each fall it's also a good way to die quickly.  :)

Be safe.
