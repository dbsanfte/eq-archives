I did beta test it from Beta one... but I was not as absorbed as you 
were. I never got a character over level 7. I found it very good 
looking, with huge amounts of empty space, although the horse rides in 
the stables helped a lot. (You run there first, then you can ride back, 
and riding back is a teleport). While the women didn't use Dolly PArton 
as a role model, the heads looked weird- tiny - like the people in the 
movie ICe Age.
