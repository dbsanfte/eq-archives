Well, the point was this.  After I had changed everything that many people
before you, bizbee and alot of other people had told me to change, due to
the aggrovation factor, I did.  As clearly stated in the posts and responses
before everyone else had gotten to me.  Now this leads me to believe one of
three things:

1.  You just read the top post and decided to give me crap before reading
every post, where many many times, I had stated that I had stopped,

2.  You just wanted to put in your 2cp and give me crap anyways,

3.  You must have missed the many posts stating, "I have stopped HTML, PGP,
and no more binaries".

I would like to believe the error was in number three.  You just missed my
posts and replies saying that I had stopped.

Even after these messages were posted,  I still get crap.  That's the reason
for my smart-ass comments.  I am told to read everything by other users, so
in the spirit of this group, I try to read everything before posting to a
particualr thread.

*You does not mean anyone in specific, it is used as a general term.
