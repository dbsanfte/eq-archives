It hasn't been possible to completly forge rolls in a long time, although
you can sometimes get away with it if people aren't really paying
attention (e.g. /rand 90 100).

But sometimes weird things happen, six people rolling as my Seb group
broke up last night:

**A Magic Die is rolled by Rogue.
**It could have been any number from 0 to 100, but this time it turned up a 32.
**A Magic Die is rolled by Shaman.
**It could have been any number from 0 to 100, but this time it turned up a 34.
**A Magic Die is rolled by Cleric.
**It could have been any number from 0 to 100, but this time it turned up a 36.
**A Magic Die is rolled by Druid.
**It could have been any number from 0 to 100, but this time it turned up a 38.
**A Magic Die is rolled by Warrior.
**It could have been any number from 0 to 100, but this time it turned up a 9.
**A Magic Die is rolled by Enchanter.
**It could have been any number from 0 to 100, but this time it turned up a 36.
