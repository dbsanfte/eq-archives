Chipped bone rod, piece of cake.

The fun one was when I died in The Overthere while on the boat, a bit too 
close to the dock.  I did hop off the boat when they attacked, and swam 
away from the dock as far as I could get before dying.  The other 
memorable one was my paladin who was headed home from Freeport, that's 
when I found out that dwarves cannot just run up onto the boat in 
Freeport.  Fell between the boat and the dock, didn't know how to swim 
yet, was franticly looking it up in the manual as I drowned.
