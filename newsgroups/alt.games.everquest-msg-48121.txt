LOL!  Well, since Valkir is my first and primary character, twinking him is
kinda tough :) There is a good story behind why I gave my BABS away - it
bears telling just to show the kind of people you can meet in the world of
Norrath...
    Being as I hadn't made it Iceclad when I hit 30th, I skipped it and went
to the Great Divide at 36th (another tale in itself ).  I get to 38th and
while soloing Dire wolves, would send an occasional /auction WTB for armor
upgrades.  A Paladin offers up a Grotesque Alloy Mask for 400pp.  While that
was half my current funds, and despite the fact that I could 'possibly' get
one on my own, I bought it.  Thing is it didn't improve my AC from my FP
mask; just changed how it got there with less AC but + to AGI. I said as
much, but that I would keep the trade for the + stats, thanked him, and
headed back out into the cold.  He sends me a tell a few minutes later,
asking if I can meet him at the Dragon Ring. I respond 'Can do. On my way.'
and head over. When there, he tells me to show him my weapons...O.K. so I
pull out all the weapons I carry: BABS, Velium Shortblade, Icetooth Claw, FS
Dagger, IBC, Sentry Maul.  He tells me that he has something he would give
to me if I can give him my word that I would not run out and sell it - but
rather when the time comes give it as freely as it was given to me.  I make
him that very promise, and he hands over a Felhammer...34 dmg/45(?) dly.
I'm astounded. Not only in the game, but that the person on the other side
of the internet is giving up something that he could sell in order to
improve his own character (he couldn't use it, as it is WAR only) to someone
he only just met. Well I reiterated my promise, and stayed with me a bit to
make sure it was to my liking; then he took his leave.  Next to this, giving
my BABS to a 41st Lvl Paladin still using a FS 2-handed sword is nothing
(found out later these two Paladins used to be in the same guild).  With
this sword, and a pair of Sporali Gloves a 52nd Lvl Monk allowed me to
borrow while we grouped in City of Mist, I was able to consistently take
aggro away from said monk.  This 2-hander should keep me from thinking about
others for quite some time. Now if I can just figure out the when and how of
passing it on...
