Ok, I'll ask here. Did a google search and nothing popping up yet.

Apparently, there are six "trials" you have to go through in order to be 
flagged, for lack of a better word, to go into the instanced zones in 
GoD? (Note: I've spent almost no time on the new continent yet.) So 
basically I'm wondering if any of the usual helpful resources out there 
have put up any initial maps of the zones that have been seen thus far 
and, more to the point, any information on this trail process. I 
understand from a friend that they are single group, LDoN style 
adventures, but with a six hour time limit instead of 90 minutes. Not 
sure what they "qualify" you for though, or how doable they are for your 
average group of 65's that aren't in uberguild Time gear.
