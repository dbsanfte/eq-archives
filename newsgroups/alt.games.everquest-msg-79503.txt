Safe rule to follow is that it makes you kos to anything not kos normally,
except in the old world, and it still does that with barbarians there, or
kejekans.

I only use wolfie when it provides a factional advantage, rather than using
it always unless it provides a faction disadvantage.

Places I use wolf.
Everfrost at Ice Giants, IGs are indifferent to wolf form. (be careful of
Tundra Jack, I've seen him outside the fort)
Lesser Faydark, fixes Brownies to not gank you (unless you've killed a LOT
of brownies)
Crushbone, makes orcs non-KoS (not that it matters unless you're being PLed,
by the time you can cast wolf, CB is mostly green) (disclaimer: I'm a wood
elf, my faction with CB orcs won't go lower, they're still VERY kos to me in
wolf)
Same with Blackburrow
Feerott, makes ogre bouncers non kos
Oggok, makes *most* ogres non kos, I was still threatening to the warrior
guild area though. (safe with SKs for sure though, oddly)
South Karana, Fixes gnolls, IIRC

Places it doesn't matter to go wolf in kunark onward.
Frontier Mountains, everythings kos anyways (unless you're doing the epic
piece with the human skelly, not sure if you go kos in wolf to her)
Overthere, Everything is kos anyways.
Warsliks Woods, everythings kos.
most of Lake of Ill Omen, not sure about the 2 non-kos guys at the mill, or
the new npcs in the fort for  +Di'Zok people.
Dreadlands *IF* Gorenaire isn't up.  If she is, she'll eat you alive.
Burning Woods, everything kos, except a couple epic people, but you can
avoid them if wolf is bad for them.
Umbral Plains unless you're working on whisperling faction
Maiden's eye
The Grey
Mons Letalis

Places not to necessarily go wolf.
if you have HIGH faction with dwarfs or giants, EW and GD is as safe as
normal
if you have HIGH faction with CoV, CS or West Wastes is as safe as normal
if you have HIGH faction with giants or CoV, WL is as safe as normal
Luclin in general

Places to never go wolf.
Halas
Firiona Vie
Sanctus Seru (unless you're hunting there)
Katta Castellum (unless you're hunting there)
Stonebrunt near the Kejek areas.
