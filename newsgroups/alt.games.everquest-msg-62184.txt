Speaking from a newbie perspective, this is the thing that annoys me most
about EQ.

Sometimes I forget to shut down ZoneAlarm before playing.  Then I try to
connect, and EQ gets all confused when ZA pops up the, "Do you want to
allow this application to access the Internet?" dialog.

Or I bump the Windows key by accident during a particularly close battle.
And die because it's difficult to get back into EQ.

Or my wife is printing from her computer (which goes through mine), and
the printer runs out of paper, popping up a dialog, which also gets EQ's
panties in a bundle.

Or I just plain want to browse the web since I like to solo frequently
and it involves *massive* amounts of downtime.  (Whatever game designer
thought it was fun to stare at a spellbook more than you get to look at
the game world is a moron.)

Don't get me wrong...I like EQ.  I even love EQ.  But it's likely I won't
subscribe for long because they've just gone out of their way to make the
game really annoying in so many ways (disabling Alt+Tab, massive downtime,
not to mention the Link Deads causing me to die and the periodic EQ
crashes that lock up my system solid...)

And please, don't preach drivers to me.  I'm a professional software
developer and highly clued re: computers and software.  I've tried lots
of driver combinations.  EQ still locks up my computer solid on a
regular basis, which almost always results in yet another character
death.

(W2K, 256 MB RAM, nVidia Riva TNT2 64M, SB AudioPCI 64V...nothing
unusual.)
