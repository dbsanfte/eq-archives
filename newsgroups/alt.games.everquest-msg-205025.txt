Amulet of the grey wastes is an easy quest to do in katta castellum
and it is an EB item.

Insta-click items are useful against mobs that dispel to add
in buffs to protect others from being dispelled.

Jboots for outdoors.
Bracer of the hidden is and insta-click see invis item.
Goblin skull earring has insta-click Grim Aura.

For classes that cannot cast gate an Awesome item to get is
the Worker's Sledgemallet quest in the Overthere. This hammer
procs a gate to The Overthere, which is damn nice since there is
now a book to PoK right there as well. The hammer is 2HB and
all/all. Some races/classes/religions cannot get the mallet due to
faction issues but for those that can its a huge time saver. Every
enchanter should have one as it is trivial for them to get one.
Hammer does not work until level 51 but you can do the faction
work ahead of time.

There are the gnomish tinker made items that can be recharged
with a collapsible toolkit and mana batteries that are damn nice
to have. Like the gauze press that makes bandages, the minimizing
device for shrinking, the vanishing device for invisibility.

There are some specific quest items for certain race/class/religions
that are nice to have like the root necklace for Tunare followers. The
snare necklace from Neriak for Innoruk followers. The Temple of
Sol Ro insta-click wand of temperate flux quest for wizards.

There are also the click evac items that wizards and druids get The crucible
of Escape, nice for saving a spell slot. The return to temple items that
Clerics get. The return to home spirit stones that Shaman get.

Man this could get to be a big list.
