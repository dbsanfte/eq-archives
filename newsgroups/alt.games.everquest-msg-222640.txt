I did essentially the same thing when I saw 75% on grief.  I don't train,
KS, scam, or any of the classic "griefing", but I answered fairly high on
the question of whether I enjoyed taunting.  I loooove taunting, fits well
with my arrogant personality.  But because I might enjoy a little trash
talk, I get a 75% on grief?  Pfft, busted test.
