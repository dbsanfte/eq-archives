And, when you do group, be sure to explain what you do and don't know. Ask for
help, the majority of players will be glad to advise you. Do your homework
though, check the message boards and websites related to your class. Tons of
good stuff out there. Sooner or later, you are going to have to suck it up and
venture out, believe me, everyone commenting before me is telling you the
truth. It's the journey, not the destination. Boy oh boy, the things you'll
see! =)
