Or do as I did. Start fletching as soon as possible. Dump all your cash into
it but remember to sell your arrows to players and to players only. People
with bows simply need arrows and your are always better than storebought
ones, and cheaper per stack too. You need skill and cunning to sell with
/auction but with patience it can be done. And the good thing with fletching
is, that everything you need is storebought and you can start with just a
few plat.

I won't go into detail about making bows. Suffice it to say that eventually
you will be creating your own market and bows can sell for a lot of plat. My
main is now level 24(just dinged, jey). He's is in full Ry'gorr (ok, I can't
find the cloak for the life of me). A master fletcher, potter, brewer and
has a good 1500pp in the bank.

And trade skills are lots of fun. My lvl 10 wizard want to go into tailoring
but gathering those materials is hell if you're used to fletching.

I say, start now, have fun, who cares about the plat. Some people save all
their loot money and some people get handed a 2kpp item from a perfect
stranger that can't be bothered to auction it off.
