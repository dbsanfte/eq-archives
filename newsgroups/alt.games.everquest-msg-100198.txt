Nothing wrong with vain... The full-black armor you have seen is Gnome 
Skin Armor, which isn't great shakes stats-wise, but looks fantastic. 
Druids, for some reason, don't get quest armor in the old world, but they 
do get Kunark armor, the Elder Spiritist series, which has a dark green 
graphic. The problem is that, realistically, you'll only be able to 
afford the minor pieces; the Breastplate and Legs are hugely expensive.
