I see that further attempts to drag you out of this self-induced
delusion to justify your being powerleveled are futile. Ah well, so be
it. But while we're on the topic...

When did it become fashionable for bards to *only* twist songs in xp
groups? I mean, sure... on a large scale raid against a big target, the
amount of melee a bard could contribute would be a pittance and there's
tons of jobs to do, fast song switching may be required, CC duties,
etc.  But in an xp group? Bards aren't "Real Tanks" (TM) but they get
the AC and the weapons choices they get for a reason. We've had some
weird post-fifty xp groups where the bard *was* the tank. Not optimal,
but functional.

Bards can dish out some measurable damage to assist the group if they
are only concentrating on a couple of main songs during the fights, and
they can use some fairly respectable weapons.

I understand that in the case of Lance's PL'd bard in PoP zones above it
wouldn't be practical, since if he drew aggro he'd be swatted like a
mosquito, but I've run into a few others recently (of appropriate level
for the group/zone) who have asked to join a group we'd be in. If we've
got an open slot, it's usually "Sure! Why not!". And then the bard
stands back with the casters and just plays. Ummmm... Doc? We'd like to
kill the monster now.

Very odd. Bards are truly the closest thing to a "do it all, Jack of all
trades" class in the game, and I'll be the first to admit they are
likely among the hardest classes to play well, but come on! Those
multiple areas of ability do include melee. Get in there and hack and
slash a bit, would ya? What's that weapon for? Decoration?
