SUVs have exactly the same pollution standards as any other car, they do not
get a license to pollut more. Matter of fact if you replaced the oldest 10%
of cars with brand new SUVs you would reduce pollution caused by autos by
70%. Incidently coal and fossil fuel powered power plants are something we
could completely remove in 5 years and remove a great deal of our
nonproblematic pollution.

Actually he didnt do a damn thing for me.I get to pay 200 dollars less in
tax each year from 4300 to 4100. Oh woop de doo. I hear he subsidizes people
with kids a bit more. Now dont get me wrong an extra 200 a year is nice but
not really anything to write home about. Of course if democrats got in
office i could expect to pay and extra thousand or two and probably earn
less due to my employer being taxed out the yin yang and burdensome new
regulation.

Riiight . Because I speed 5 miles over the limit every other thursday I have
absolutely no right to criticize that rapist axe murder over there.

The more evenly you try to slice the pie the less pie there is overall.
Capitalism is the unequal sharing of wealth, socialism is the equal sharing
of misery. Or in other words what the god damn hell do you mean when you say
your poor people have tvs, cars, air conditioners, and food so plentifull
that the number one health concern among poor people is obesity. Compare
that to rich people in other countries :)
