If you have that much DPS, why are you killing the yard trash so slowly that
your healers have run out of mana and need a break?  A break long enough
that you're threatened by respawns?

*shrug*  For most of my time I played a warrior.   For me to consider myself
"hurt", I was down several thousand points.    Even if it was only 2000
health down, 20 clicks at 15 seconds per click, thats three hundred
seconds... or about 5 minutes.   Or one complete heal, which can be medded
back in 50'ish?seconds, with C3.

Never disputed that... but it's now worth less, and it was never worth all
that much to begin with.   Only the Myrkolar(sp?) Breastplate (Rogue Kuark)
was worth more, since they screwed up adding it and never fixed it.

Above 200 skill it either goes to a new table, or gets a one time boost.
At 210 bind wound, I was healing 90+ per bandage, with a cycle time of
around 8 or 10 seconds.   Compared to 100 healing per 14 seconds.   Thats
without the "Heals more per bandage" AA.
