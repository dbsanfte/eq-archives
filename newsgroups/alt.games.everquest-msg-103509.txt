/shout is for in-character transmissions that are intended to
be received by everyone in the zone.

/ooc is for out of character transmissions that are intended
to be received by everyone in the zone.

/tell is for transmissions of any sort that are intended
for a specific recipient.

...doesn't seem that complicated to me.

Persons A and B bragging to each other isn't appropriate
for /ooc, since they were intending their discussion to
be heard by the other person, and probably didn't actually
consider it to be of general interest to everyone in the zone.
...or if they did, they should have known better.

/ooc and /shout are best reserved for questions where
you need a large pool of people to have a chance at finding
someone with the answer ("/ooc I'm having trouble with this
GeForce card, does anyone have any suggestions?", "/shout
has anyone seen quest_npc_01?"), or announcements that might
be of general interest ("/shout Train to WL zone!", "/shout
No Drop quest item on mob01 at <loc>, come if you need it"),
and so on.  I also don't mind humorous comments that could
be appreciated by most EQ players, they add entertainment
to the game, but unfortunately most people overestimate 
their level of wit.
