I'd like to see something akin to Spell/Song Groups, where you could
define a group as being a particular set of spells/songs. It doesn't
necessarily have to increase the speed of memorization, but it would
take away the need for moving around the spell/song icons manually so
you'd save time in that sense.

Pressing a key for a Spell Group would remove all current spells, put
you into spellbook mode, then give a countdown bar until all your
spells have been memorized. Cancelling the operation might leave you
with just a few spells from the group memorized, or none at all.
