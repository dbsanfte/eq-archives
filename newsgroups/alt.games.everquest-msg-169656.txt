Cel made a prexun druid to stalk me with, you should of followed her there
instead!  2 women stalkers.. yes please :)

I could buy 3.. but a r/l friend (cleric who I bot, but not my cleric) just
won a horse though (dropped from a Luclin boss) and its faster than what you
can buy.. so if it was a waste of money before, it is even more so now if
the rest of us can't keep up with him

Nah don't be, shaman is only 63 with 10 or 11 AA's.. I used to give just
monkey solo exp a lot whilst he was working towards crucial skills (aka
rapid feign 3) and jak got left behind
