Although I certainly agree with your PvP statements, I have to disagree with
your PvE statements.  The PvE in EQ is decent but by level 35, the answer to
"challenge" always seems to be more damage and more hit points.  In DAOC,
the Vendo Bone Collectors attack the group healers first.  Also, the damage,
the hit points, and the resistances of mobs seems to be more uniform from
level to level than in EQ.

I can't seem to figure out why feasible, yet challenging PvE translates into
"sink without a trace".  Frankly, I think that is exactly what will attract
many people to DAOC.  The level 35+ game in EQ is a complete disappointment
to me, and that is one of the reasons why I am moving over to DAOC.
