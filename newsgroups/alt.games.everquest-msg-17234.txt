At lvl 15 my necro has finally managed to get around 130pp in the bank
and that feels good but it takes me nowhere all the good stuff costs
way more sadly :( and after buying my lvl 16 rounds of spells i will
be down to zero , well a large amount will be gone anyway.

I think that nektulos has become almost boring now, people asking for
stuff all the time, it's like a beggar market.
