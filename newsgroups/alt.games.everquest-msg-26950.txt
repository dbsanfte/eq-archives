Everquest is the gh3y357 game ever invented.  (gh3y357=gayest for gay fag
homosexual lamers)

The only stupider thing I can imagine spending money for would be AOL . .
.Well maybe even not that

You can't even have a war for god's sake!  Everyone on individual questions.
Carrying shit, selling it on ebay . . WTF!

You Questars can kiss my perverted asshole . . . .  The only decision you
have to decide now is. . .   Should I keep boning my mother while playing
your dumbass game, or reply to this lame flame?

Thank you

Flames welcome . . . .
