Yeah, we've had this happen also.  Apparently he sometimes like to do
this (repop the entire zone) at random times also while he's already
up.  I think we were prepping for him one time, and he just decided
that we shouldn't be done yet.  So, while we're standing in the middle
of the zone, he decided we wanted his friends back.

Led into a nasty CR for 40+ people.

This all adds support to my theory that Fear just plain sucks ass and
is the worst zone in the game.  Putting epic bits in there was just a
huge kick in the noots.
