First: HC Hell is pretty small segment of the game. Like Rallos Zek to 
EQ. The problems in HC Hell are unique to HC Hell, and don't justify a 
system-wide revamp. I played HC exclusively; and a little common sense 
was all that was required to avoid pks. HC Hell was a special case.

But, 2nd: By your own admission, HC Hell has a working solution: 
"Private games".
