I have a 45 Warrior that I recently equipped with a Wurmmy. STA seems
to be a problem using this weapon. in a prolonged (group) fight STA is
reduced to the point where I feel that I have to back off.  There
follows a rapid recovery, to 20-30 %  and I rejoin the fray. Sometimes
I go through this routine 2 maybe 3 times if multiple mobs are
involved.

What happens if STA goes to zero ?

The wurmmy hits hard. Crits in the 160 hp range, averages (per parser)
about 40 over a 4/5 hour session. Having said that I have come to the
conclusion that I need to get rid of the wurmmy and get a something
lighter and probably less effective. I f I did my Copeland work right
there are only seven (No Drop) 1 hand slash weapons better, than the
wurm...

Back to the topic......No STR = ?
