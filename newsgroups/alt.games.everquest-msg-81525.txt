Also, I'd definitely recommend SoW'ing yourself before the run, and being full
up on mana before the run.  Camo (and invis) can drop at any time, and as Murphy's
law has it, at the worst time.

Be on the watch for some NPC bastard named Vekis (I think).   I try to run through so quickly
that I don't look at  names.   I got caught with camo down once running through
there, and Vekis cast some high DoT poison on me.  Killed me before I could get
to the guard.

To be on the safe side, have your best heal, cure poison, and cure disease memmed.
And wear any resist gear you have.
If you do get tagged with one of those DoT's, run past the guard if you can, then burn
mana trying to cure and heal yourself.

This kind of problem happens maybe 1 time in 40, but still it stinks when it does.

Another safe way would be to run through the zone with a 19+ level bard who can
sing Shauri's Sonorous Clouding which doesn't drop like camo or invis.  You SoW him
or her so that they don't have to twist Selo's Accelerondo, then you group up and run
together.  I haven't tried this, but I think it should work.
