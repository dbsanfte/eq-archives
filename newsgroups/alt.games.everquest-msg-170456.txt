If you go to Dalnir, take a group, or at least be in a decent duo.  If you 
do the whole zone, the exp will last you up up to 35 or 36 before it drops 
off.  I don't know how far a duo can go, though, unless one of them can 
Lull.  We did it with 5-6 people and a bard as CC and it got hairy when we 
got deep into it.

Very underutilized zone, BYOG.  Several casters there, though.  A few ok 
drops.  No EXP bonus. =(
