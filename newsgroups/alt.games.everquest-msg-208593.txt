Dont kill reds...takes too long, just kill loads of blues and whites.

Red PLing is the druids domain, up to level 30-35 or so, where mobs start to
hit harder than the DS and regen can offset.

After that, a combo of shammy and druid would probably work best.

But as you dont have those, just buff plee, fight lots of mobs you can kill
fast (maybe finishing them at 45% with your main for faster exp), then heal
after fight, rinse, repeat.
