I'm sure there are people out there legally using photoshop with no 
clue... but there are a lot more people out there with pirated versions 
of the software... orders of magnitude more.

Even your laptop example is somewhat unlikely for photoshop... the vast 
majority of people that I've encountered with photoshop on their laptops 
had an illegal copy... even those that legally owned it. (The legal copy 
was on their desktop/workstation.)
