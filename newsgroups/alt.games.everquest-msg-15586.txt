Nah, I think the skyclad transfer is to keep pure the independent 
economies of the various servers.

Well, how about a somewhat opposite reason?  I have some friends in RL who 
play on a different server than I.  It would be nice to go play with them, 
but  they're bloody high level and I'd never catch up.  But I have some 
moderately high characters that don't get played very often on my main 
server...
