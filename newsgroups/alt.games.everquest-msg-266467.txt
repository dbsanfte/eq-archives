Well, I pre-ordered from Gamespot months ago.  They even went to the trouble 
of making up some false labels to show the games shipping when they didnt. 
FedEx said they were never called to pick it up...Gamespot is saying that 
their was a duplicate order problem.
Bottom line, no game.

Second time in couple of years Gamespot has done this to me.  Won't happen 
again.
