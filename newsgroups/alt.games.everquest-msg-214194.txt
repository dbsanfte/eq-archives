From the shadows, the mysterious jennaii@aol.comnojunk (Jennaii) (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

So instead of the enchanter or cleric folding in three hits, the
ranger can instead! Muahaha! :-)

Ranger heals may "suck" but they still tend to be better than bind
wounds from a time management standpoint, especially when fearkiting
when you don't normally fall below half health anyways.

Man I wish I could get away with that on test....


>Once you get Stinging Swarm keep that on the monsters too.  

Depends, its a bit of a mana hog, not usually necessary unless you're
drippings with mana.


>Snare the mob if it tries to run away, root adds if there is no enchanter. 

Should normally snare the mob BEFORE it tries to run away.


>Keep the cleric sowed once you get sow.

Enchanter too. Few other classes need sow at all during normal pulling
(besides the puller). Watch out if someone who doesn't need it demands
it; thats the sign of an inexperienced player who may bolt at
inopportune times.
