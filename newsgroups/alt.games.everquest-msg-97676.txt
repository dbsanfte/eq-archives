Yes, now I see.  I think 'Singasong' would not be allowed, but that
'Songsinger' would be.  I have to say, it's a bit subtle for a child to
get, but we both do now.

     "It's a compound word, not a phrase.  I still
     think some GM's are stingier than others."

Probably so, but a rule's a rule.  It still perplexes him that
"Hugashrub" was accepted, but "Singasong" was not.  I hope
I get to keep the name, 'cause I love my wood elf.     :-)
