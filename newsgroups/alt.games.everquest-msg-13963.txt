Runnyeye is easiest.  Follow the right wall when you enter Runnyeye, and
that will take you to the zone.  Some of the goblins there will probably
aggro on you, and might even be blue, so you can stop and kill them for
some XP.  You can also probably run right through with a few whacking
you...it is a short trip between zone in and zone out.  BTW, the new
goblin runts regen 11 HP/tick, so are much tougher than they look, and I
believe they will be green to you, so don't waste time fighting if one
of those gets on you.  Just run.

Selo's lasts for two or three cycles after zoning, doesn't it?  If so,
you can probably make it all the way through before you slow down.

In the Gorge, follow the left wall.  With Selo's, you'll easily outrun
anything there that might aggro, once you get past the goblins outside
Runnyeye (some of them are Shamans, and those bastards go around SOWing
the others).

I think level 12 Selo's will outrun everything in EK.  In NK, watch out
for Grimfeather.  Don't go too far north or you'll run into some nasty
named treants.  I don't know if they are hostile to Half Elf Bards or not,
but they are Druids, and cast some nasty spells, so don't go near them.

In WK, keep to the path, and you won't run into anything that would
bother a level 12.
