I dumped the 10 points I got for leveling from 60 to 62 into going from 155
to 165 in Bash.  The skill was added relatively recently, and I got it at
35 skill at level 60.  It went up quite rapidly till around 100, then
slowed a bit till 135 or so, then became glacial, as in a point every
couple days played.  When I hit 155, a little light went on in my head as I
realized I had earned ten more points doing the two new levels!

I'm very very glad I didn't spend those two points getting the skill from
35 to 45, which was less than an hours casual use of the skill in fights.
Using them at the end, where they represented an estimated months work, was
far better!
