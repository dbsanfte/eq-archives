not being able to solo at the high end of EQ, I.E. 60 plus  up to 65 and just
waiting for EQ II to come out because it is being touted and being more solo'er
friendly? And it seems to get worse with the release of every expansion?

Will EQ II change this or is there  simply NO role for a solo player in the EQ
multiverse?
