#1, rolling involves typing /random and a number usually 100, this generates
a random number between 1 and 100, highest wins.
#2, yes in a duel you can have your 60 cleric friend or whoever buff you, it
doesnt matter if its unfair since nothing can be gained or lost by dueling,
with the exception of betting on the duel, but even then buffing can still
take place and potentially rigg the duel this is called racketeering, and is
illegal in the gambling community at least thats what the police say i dont
want to get into that though ...
