I would recommend Diamond or Blue Diamond gear, thats what I got it works
fine for me.. Also, the crown of the froglok kings (drops in lguk off the
live king dude) is like... i dont remember exactly but I think its 12 AC,
greater light source, 20 FR and CR. I swap that with my runed cowl alot, I
can get my cold and fire near 70 unbuffed with that and diamond gear
