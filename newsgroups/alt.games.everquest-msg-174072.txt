The gold Edition (US Version) has al the expansions in it and comes in a
gold tim box.  The Gold Edition (European Version) comes with everything
except POP and is a Black cardbord box with gold lettering on it.  IF you
can find the US version buy That.  I have seen it for about $60, but if not
grad the Ero version and add PoP when you get tired of using the spires.
???Do they still work???  I haven't gon by one since I got PoP.  I think
I'll do that tonight.  just for nosalgia sake.
