Thanks!  Nice to be reading again.  I forgot how helpful this newsgroup 
is for keeping up with EQ.

The Lords of Midnight!  I never noticed until I joined a guild how 
suspiciously similar all the names sounded ;) I'm thinking if I ever 
learn programming, I'll start up a random guild name engine *wg*  So 
far, I'm really enjoying the guild.  It's quite new, and most of us are 
quite young and around the same levels, so we're going through the same 
things mostly together.  In fact we went on our first raid as a group 
(and for at least two of us, our first raid ever) in Befallen today.  
Yes, Befallen. :D  If you feel like thinking "aww, look at the cute 
little things take on the big bad skeletons!", feel free to check out 
the webpage.  I whipped it up a couple days ago and have been updating 
ever since.  Now I see why nobody else eagerly jumped in volunteering to 
design ;)
