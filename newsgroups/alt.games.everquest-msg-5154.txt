Rogues have many escape mechanisms:

	Evac (from druid or wizard in group)
	Translocate (from wizard in group)
	Atone (from cleric in group)
	Memblur (from enchanter in group)
	SOW (from druid, ranger, or shaman in group)
	Selos (from bard in group)
	Shadow Step (from bard in group)
	Snare (from druid, ranger, or wizard in group)
	Root (from numerous classes, or from mage's earth pet)

Rogue's are meant to be in groups.
