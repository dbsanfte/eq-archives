Actually, if you have lev just run straight up the spit towards the tower, 
and go off the end of the spit just to the right of the tower.  Run until 
you hit the wall, and go under the water, you should see the tunnel right 
there.  The correct location for the tunnel is about +1100, +1610.  Swim 
in the tunnel, and you quickly come back to dry land.  There is a left 
then a right and about 3 feet later is the zone.  
In SG you will either have to swim or succor.  If you can succor, good on 
ya, otherwise, it helps to have SoW/selos/runspeed and lots of HP.  The 
swim is short, and if you don't get stunned, you should make it pretty 
easily.  Starting from where you zone in there is a short passageway, 
usually with a couple aggro mobs at the just out of aggro range.  Where 
the mobs are the passage opens to the left with a little ledge and then 
the water.  None of the dry-land mobs see-invis, so if invis you can walk 
up to this ledge safely.  Stand on the ledge, look slightly left, and in 
the water you can see a tunnel guarded by two seahorses.  The seahorses 
see invisible, hit hard, and stun.  Beyond them is a third seahorse.  
Beyond the third seahorse the tunnels opens up vertically, and has a 
waterfall on the right side.  
Unless you are level 60, you most likely will aggro the seahorses.  I 
prefer to swim below them, others prefer to swim above them.  I haven't 
seen a difference in aggro, so whichever you prefer.  If you swim directly 
between two seahorses, you can aggro them but hopefully get far enough 
ahead to not get hit and stunned.  Just keep on going, don't stop, don't 
gawk, don't freak out when the third seahorse joins the chase.  When the 
tunnel opens up above you, head up fast as you can and go over the 
waterfall.  The seahorses have never followed me over the falls, but I 
don't dawdle in the water either.  
Once you're over the falls you want to get out onto the nearest spit of 
dry land, to your left as you're going over the falls.  There is a little 
corner which is generally out of mob aggro range, if you want to re-invis 
for the last little run.  Keep the wall on your left, go out around the 
boulder, and there is a tunnel to the left.  Take that, stay left, and 
run.  You may aggro a mob, just keep going.  You will pass a 'servant 
<mob>' that is non aggro, and then the next left will be the zone line to 
WW.  
Running across WW is not that tough if you have invis.  There are several 
mobs that can see invis, and they're all named mobs.  The only tricky one 
is Mraaka, the named wyrm.  All of the other named mobs are dragon models, 
and are easy to spot.  Mraaka looks like any other cragwyrm, but is level 
63 instead of 45-53 like the wyrms.  If you can invis and levitate, do 
both, head out of the tunnel, and head directly NW.  You'll pass over one 
deep chasm and then drop into the second chasm.  At about +700, +700 there 
is a tunnel entrance.  DON'T GO IN THERE WITHOUT CHECKING ON SONTALAK!  
He's the big, red, nasty, evil, always see-invis dragon.  Generally, if 
he's up, you'll have to have someone fast (bard or brave SoW caster) run 
him out so that you can run to the back of the tunnel and click the zone 
entrance thingie.  Ask in /ooc or /shout though, since Sont is often stuck 
and will not aggro if you run by on the right side.  If you want to try to 
pull him out and run past on your own, I would strongly suggest a 
high-level SoW, NOT J-Boots.  You will also need to warn the zone, since 
people med and rez at the back of the tunnel.  Give the zone several 
warnings over 2-3 minutes, so you don't kill someone AFK for a second.  Be 
polite and wait if someone asks you to.  
To kite Sont around I use Selos song, and a long-range debuff song.  I 
start Selos, give my final '/shout Sont being kited around, run in when 
you see him run out' warning, and hit him with a debuff from maximum 
ranger.  I then run up the middle of the chasm heading north, and make 
sure I don't get too close to the other dragons on the east wall.  I make 
a 180 degree left turn near the north end, and head south along the west 
wall, then run almost all the way to the south.  I turn around again 
(watch out for dragons on the east wall) and run back, hit my '/shout Sont 
heading to tunnel' hotkey and hit the tunnel and zone as soon as I reach 
the back of the tunnel.
