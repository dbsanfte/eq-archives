Deathpeace gives SKs two chances to FD, and their first FD should have recycled 
by that time.  They have more HPs, and generally better AC, so they can 
withstand a failed FD more easily.
For everyday pulling, a monk is the best, for certain hard to pull areas, with 
mobs that hit HARD and FAST, an SK seems to survive a bit better.

What I'm really wondering is why do people who claim to be raiding endgame mobs 
continue to insist that you put 1 cleric per group?  Granted we're not dropping 
Statue yet, but we're dropping 200khp mobs with less than 30 people, and we're 
putting clerics in either one CHeal group or in two MA/SA groups.  If we expect 
the fight to last longer than defensive, we'll set up two groups with warrior, 3 
clerics, bard, and shaman/druid/pally to heal the clerics.  The first tank 
establishes aggro, calls in the rest of us, and hopes the CHeal rotation doesn't 
break.  The bard is responsible for calling tank switch, due to dead tank, 
clerics OOM, or defensive down.  When a tank switch is called, 2nd tank gets 
right in mobs face, everyone else stops attacking, and 2nd Cheal chain goes into 
effect.  Done right the first group of clerics will have enough mana to cover 
for 2nd group when they're out of mana.  If we need to switch tanks a second 
time, we fail.  Still learning, but it's working for us.
The other 3 groups live with shaman, druid, pally, necro heals and work on not 
getting aggro.
