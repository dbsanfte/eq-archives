>and yes, Argro kiting is an option, in fact, it's what we managed to do.

A druid and I (at 53/54)  managed to get her from 90% to 20% or so
while a similar tragedy occured a few months back, was quite a
rush....  The trick for me, as a wiz, was to be well away from her as
I sat down to med up enough for the next Nuke.  Pretty sure I was
using lures, which arent very economical, but almost guaranteed to hit
for full.

Once the party was ressed and ready the last few slivers of her went
down no problem.

I really miss fear kiting her tho, that was fun AND easy.
