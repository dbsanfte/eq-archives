Oh, I forgot to mention that EverQuest is on a different drive than the 
operating system, just a small detail... As for the RAM, I have just 266 
right now anyway. I also read that with my motherboard (A7V333) if I put 
three chips of 333MHz RAM in then it will drop to 266MHz, so I'm just 
gonna stick with that speed. Since EQ is on another hard drive, will I 
need to reinstall it so the OS will see it or anything?
