Well, maybe not good ones, but they sure were frustrating to me.
Problem is how to tell the stories without harming the innocent? :)

Let's see. The time in (unnamed zone) with three groups. 2 groups
of 5, one group of 3. I was in the group of 3. Right in the middle
of a hairy fight, my group suddenly found itself at the succor point.
Seeing's how only one in our group had the spell, it was pretty
obvious who had messed up but they denied it. Even after the other
two of us looked back and saw the two lines 'X casts spell. Loading,
Please wait...' lines, they denied that they had done anything.
They then almost immediately started heading back in. Unfortunately, 
they had forgotten that we hadn't went into the zone that way to begin 
with so had no clue where they were going AND that we had been invis'ed
for a lot of the way in in the first place. Instant train back to
the succor point, forcing all of us to zone. THEN they decided to
run around to our original zone in point, *again* forgetting they
weren't invis'ed. By that time, myself and the other person in the
group had wised up and I camo'ed both of us before the other train
made it back to us so only one of us was caught between the two
trains.

Or the day we had an event specifically aimed towards a large group
of us getting our archery skills up. We had one tank, 8 or 10 archers
ranging from somewhere in their 20's to the 50's and a couple of
healers. Now, remember. Our *specific purpose* was to shoot scads of
arrows and not have anyone die in the process. Plan was to let the
tank get aggro, snare the mob and have the tank lead it around in
circles while the archers twanged away at it. The 65's job in that
case was to one, snare, and two, keep the tank alive. All the way
to the end of this hour to hour and a half event, even pretty con-
stant reminders of 'DON'T root! STOP nuking! STOP DoTing' wasn't
working.

Those are just the two that stand out for me right now. You know,
I'm not saying that *everyone* who levels to 65 quickly is bad.
Just as I'm not saying that since I've taken 1 1/2 years to make
it to 55 that it makes me good. I know I'm not that good in cer-
tain situations. Since most of my time, I've soloed, I'm tentative
in groups and ask a lot of questions when I'm not sure if I'm doing
the right things. The 'quickly leveled 60+' I've been around tend
to equate 'good' with 'higher level'. And that's just not true, IMO.
