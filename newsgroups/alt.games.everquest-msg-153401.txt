Sure, but if its really critical he procs, I'll just cast primal avater on
him with my shaman

Ya its nice in situations where you really need to kill something but lack
of a chanter means spells arent landing.  I did a named 60 mob before that
was flurrying, and as soon as the paladin tashed it I could land slow.  Same
for the Taskmaster Abbot in GD, yellow con (level 61+) the ranger tashed,
and I could slow it.

Well he doesn't join your average group.  Generally when hes "tanking" its
with a 25point DS, and because I need to do at least 1 point of damage (or
the DS will take exp)...

Or when im preparing an ae pull on the monk (been ae'ing droga with him) -
its pointless casting a PB AE with 1 target there.  So the little wizzy (lvl
43) tanks the goblin, I finish my monks ae pull (20-30 gobbies), then use my
other wizard (lvl 60) to kill them all (I can kill 99% of the goblins with 1
spell, all at the same time, so it means im not totally dependent upon a
chanter to keep all the mobs stunned)

The little wiz has been pl'd a lot, but his defence is maxed, his 1hb is
maxed, most of his spells are maxed (exceptions being invis - I never use
it, and specialisation - I was too lazy to train it at 20, so only just did
it at level 43)
