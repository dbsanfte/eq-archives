}My server has set up a Market Channel with the new chat system. People sell
}and buy there all day long. Fine, great! I sometimes go and have a look at
}what is for sale. Then you have the 0ober peeps (Sorry, my l3wt d3wd speek
}isn't very good) who INSIST on having stupid conversations on this channel.
}Myself, and a few others, suggest, that with this fantasitc new system, they
}set up a channel called... *GASP* "CHAT"?! (Would you believe it!!!)
}However, Mr and Mrs Annoying decides to turn to Mr and Mrs Nasty and just
}flame everyone who suggest this, saying that there are no rules for these
}chats... Good thing there is such a thing as a moderator to these chats ;o)
}Oh, and the ever popular /leave market :o)

The largest channel on Ayonae Ro is called bazaar.  This same argument 
occurs roughly daily there.  Personally, I'm glad there's an anywhere 
chat channel with people in it that actually talk.  My guild tends to go 
to bed before I do, it gets kinda lonely if I've decided to solo camp 
something.  The argument usually has one side saying 'the channel was 
created for Auctions ONLY'.  The other side replies, er, did you create 
the channel? a lot happens in a bazaar besides peple selling stuff, you 
know... if you want an auctions only channel, why not create one called 
'market' or (gasp) 'auctionsonly'.  The response... Well, I tried, but 
there was no one there...

Personally, I'd like to see a channel specifically for selling things a 
sane person can afford.  If it costs less than a CoF, it's not gonna 
turn up in bazaar.
