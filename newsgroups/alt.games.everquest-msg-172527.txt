Actually, population concerns are the biggest problem right now,
not the lack of, moron.

I notice you are still stalking me across Usenet, "Hope Munro Smith".
You haven't been able to stop talking about me and following
me from newsgroup to newsgroup for about a year.

Isn't it time you let go?

--

You've been proven to be a fraud, "Hope Munro Smith".

You claim to be a Marxist yet espouse libertarian ideology.  
You claim to be an environmentalist but side with pro-polluters.  
You claim to be a feminist but support misogynism. 
You claim to be intimate with the subjects of literature and 
music but show extreme ignorance in both fields.  
You claim to have a an education, but the only learning you've 
demonstrated is the ability to read the TV guide and watch 
lowbrow television.  
You consistently offer your uneducated opinion on issues you
know nothing about, and yet, you refuse to actually educate
yourself or peruse the subject matter to make an informed opinion.
You call others "stalkers" when they point out your fallacious nonsense, 
yet you stalk posters across multiple newsgroups, over and over again,
invading threads and spreading further nonsense.
You call others kooks, but you threatens to instigate lawsuits
over Usenet posts like every archetypal kook on the net.    

In short, "Hope Munro Smith" is a fraud -- a pseudo-intellectual 
chameleon that has been found out, exposed, and debunked.
