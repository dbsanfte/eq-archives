Probably just a breakdown in terminology. Yes, I suppose they are social
in that they assist each other. (Unlike, for example, most snakes and
such which will calmly lay there next to you and watch you kill one of
their siblings.) But the key trait I have to look for in any type of mob
for a quadding subject is the ones that won't turn and flee (or at least
stop and *try* to flee) when at low health as long as any of their
buddies are alive. Not sure exactly what the common term for that is in
the EQ lexicon, but the Ulthorks do it and apparently the Rhinos don't.
Gnolls in SK and Dire Wolves in GD all do it too, making them great.
Spiders of most types, unfortunately won't. (Or I'd be in Kunark
quadding Drachnids right now.)
