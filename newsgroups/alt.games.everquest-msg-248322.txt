I just got started playing a level 5 Human Warrior until I get familar with the
game but I do have a few questions so far. I been roaming around Freeport and I
was wondering are there any specific quests that need to be done and where so I
go to get them? Or do I just wander about aimlessly and slash and bash all
these rats, bats, snakes,skeletons, etc?. Also, How do I chat with the NPCs to
get information? 

Thanks.
