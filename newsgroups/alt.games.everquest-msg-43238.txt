I'm sorry, I just don't agree with this.  Monks may cause a lot of
aggro with all the damage they do, but a good, effective tank should
be able to keep aggro, even with monks putting out more damage.  I can
see this being a slight problem in the low 50s, but once you're
standing next to a 60 warrior, it's going to take a lot more than a
little extra damage to get the aggro on you.  
I honestly don't think it's hard at all for a good solid warrior
(especially a 60 warrior) to maintain aggro, and most good monks will
quickly learn what the new changes do to aggro.  I also think that
mobs you hunt for exp don't kill you fast enough to be a problem,
since the monk can FD if he draws aggro.  Raid mobs are a different
story, and if the MA can't hold aggro there, you have other problems
to deal with.
