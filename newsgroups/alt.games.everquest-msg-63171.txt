Enlightened Dark took out all 4 warders and freed Kerafyrm on friday.

And for some reason, Ventani dropped 5 robes.


The new warning on Sleeper's Tomb is
A warning fills your mind "HEED THESE WORDS!  This prison was made to hold
the most dangerous being ever to walk the face of Norrath.  The  combined
might of all Wurmkind was required to subdue Kerafyrm, and only long
vigilance kept him imprisoned.  He has since broken free of his bonds,
thanks to interlopers such as yourself.  His prison is kept in readiness,
for Wurmkind prevailed once, it shall prevail again.


Then ED went on to put 2 teams past the prelims in ToT.

Hooray for DT...  err.... nevermind.
