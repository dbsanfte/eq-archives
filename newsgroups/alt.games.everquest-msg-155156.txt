Yupp.

Say Hello to Tsunamis or Zamthial and of course Scathan.  Tsunamis is
my main, lvl 43 Wiz.  Or at least he was my main.  Now he is rather
depressed.  First character I actually spent enough time on to level
quickly (quickly for my schedule) and his exited goal of manaburn is
being nerfed.

I don't ask for much,  I just want ultimate power............
