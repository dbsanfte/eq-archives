That was a fun snip.  Got a chuckle out of that.

I'm good for a discussion/debate.  Not much for arguments, though ... they
seldom accomplish anything positive.

After the first few attempts, someone decided that the ends don't justify
the means, both in time and expense.

Even you catch someone red handed, looks can be deceiving.

For example, suppose on the day before my account expires in July I decide
that there's absolutely no way I'll ever return to EQ.  So I call a RL buddy
who still plays, tell him to meet me in the bazaar, and offload all of the
plat off my mule.  That's probably close to 20K plat ... would look kinda
fishy if someone from SOE was right there watching.

Ban me, I don't care ... I'm gone anyway.  Ban him?  He's done absolutely
nothing wrong .. bad idea.  A situation like that would probably get
resolved over the course of a few weeks, but it would engender a lot of bad
feelings.
