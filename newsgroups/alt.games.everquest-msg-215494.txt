The "level" of the adventure is calculated from the level of the
players. How it's calculated I don't know - seems to be an average,
then if the average is under some threshold you get level X, otherwise
you get level X+5.

The adventure level is done in steps of 5 levels, so there are level 20,
25, 30, 35, ... up to 65 adventures, then (allegedly) a custom-tailored
difficulty level for the "hard" 65 adventure.

As nearly as I can figure it works like this:
- The game calculates the level of the adventure from the level of the
  players. No idea how 4 and 5 player groups are handled, since all
  the adventures I've been in so far have had 6 people.
- If the "hard" adventure is chosen, the adventure level is increased
  by 5 (so a level 25 rather than 20 adventure, and so on).
- The points awarded are strictly based on the level of the adventure.
  So the level 60 adventure is worth 34 points, level 65 is worth 51
  points, level 70 (the "hard" 65) is worth 76 points.
- Partial successes are awarded one quarter of the standard points
  award, rounded up.
- The points awarded at each "level" are about two thirds of the next
  highest level, rounded up.

Yes, the domain is sad, but effective. :-)
