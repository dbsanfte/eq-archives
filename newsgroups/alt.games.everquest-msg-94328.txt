What's really annoying is when people kill the tainted seafury (who is just
a normal melee level 47-ish guy), which spawns the Corrupted seafury (level
52ish SUMMONS), the corrupted will stay right on top of the tainted's corpse
and not move unless pulled.  But some people spawn the corrupted in
OBNOXIOUS places, like the middle of the AC camp, under the sister isle dock
or under the boat path near seafury isle (thus meaning anyone who jumps off
to go to seafury isle gets splatted)
