Yep.

I can kindof do something similar (tho much more difficult) -

I have a weapon that procs ensnare (sap from Tunare), and I also have 255
dex.  If snaring it is the only forseable way of making a split (and the mob
is actually snarable) then I'll let them run to me,  /disc stone, and melee
the mob hoping for a proc.  When low I FD obviously, hit mend, and if it was
snared I'll wait till the rest return home then pull it, otherwise I'll let
them all reset, get a heal and try again.

Its not often I have to rely on snare to make a split though (monks come up
with methods to get around stuff like that)..  last time I did it, I needed
to hand in dorf heads to Captain Bvellos in Kael.  I was kos to most of kael
(maybe even the captain at the time, but with sneak it doesn't matter).

Well that week they had changed Bvel, he no longer chilled in the bank, but
roamed from Tormax room to the arena (all of which I was kos to and couldn't
sneak past).. so I fought him till proc, quit out (mobs that camp corpses
dont lose agro till they return to their spawn) then had 11 minutes of him
not moving, for me to hand in my stuff.

Depends on the situation.. 2 falls to the ground in a row (it happens) and
id be slightly worried.. thats when you move some place that buys you a bit
of time (as a puller you learn pathing in major raid places), if your
stunned then you use stonestance, if meds up then your probably ok.. if any
are casters then they make it lots tougher
