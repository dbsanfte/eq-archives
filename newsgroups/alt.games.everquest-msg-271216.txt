Has anyone here tried a controller other than a keyboard for MMORPGs?  
I've been toying with the idea of moving my Windows PC next to the TV 
and doing my gaming in the living room.  (61" DLP, 1280x720, so should 
be fine).

I've done some experiments, using my laptop and World of Warcraft (my 
laptop is a PowerBook, and Blizzard is nice enough to include a Mac 
version of WoW on the same discs as the PC version), with a wireless 
mouse and keyboard, and MMORPGs seem to be quite pleasant on the big 
screen.  The problem is that a keyboard is awkward to use when not at a 
desk...and a mouse isn't all that great, either.

For most of the time in an MMORPG, I'm just running around exploring, 
which just uses movement keys and mouselook, or fighting, which just 
involves a few spells or abilities, so it seems like there would be 
enough buttons and such on modern gamepads, assuming the software is 
reasonable.  I'd expect to also keep a keyboard around for chatting, 
inventory manipulation, and spells that aren't used often (such as 
reapplying buffs every so often).
