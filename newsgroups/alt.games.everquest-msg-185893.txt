Well, noone forces you to use it. Myself, I will be retiring my Big Three 
Ring Binder O' Maps.

Myself, I love that I can draw a map and add my own stuff to it, then shoot 
it off to a friend or guildmate (This is the spot we will pull Mob X to, 
and we will go this way. Here here here here and here are where mobs pop. 
Etc.)

Wonder? WONDER? Whatever. It takes out the COMPLETE pain in the ass travel 
entailed. The world is not smaller, it is just easier to get around in. 
This matters to me now that I can't solo and can't reliably find a group in 
any given zone during my play time.

??? How do people fighting in zones you can't even enter sour the game for 
you? Do you measure your enjoyment by competing with others?

That really is a shame. 

I had the same problem a while back. I started raiding a bit more and 
exploring a bit more, and the wonder was brought back. Pulling Vox's lair 
for one made me realize that this game can still excite me, and can hold my 
interest. I know I will never be uber- while I am a bit sour on that, I 
know that I can enjoy the parts of the game I *can* see.
