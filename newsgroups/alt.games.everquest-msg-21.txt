Be thankful that you did not get the SK or paladin
drops, they are purchasable in the thurgadin cleric guild
and the gnome igloos; trash drop.

The wizard port spell is also trash, although marginally
better than the hybrid ones.  It is far more common than
any of the other drops, and practically worthless, due to
the dragon sitting atop the source of the no drop tooth you
need to use the spell. (or be affected by it if you are in a
group that uses it)

Check again; wizard spell aside, you got no more than
one spell per class, right?
