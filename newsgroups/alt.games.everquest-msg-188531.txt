Ooh, clever. I could have worked that out had I thought about it,
having observed that vendors place new stuff in the first available
slot instead of at the end, but I had never thought to make use of
that. So much for me being smart. ;-)

Won't help when I'm just looking for stuff I can make a profit on, but
when looking for tradeskill supplies I can see it being very useful. I
haven't often seen vendor mining costing a lot, though, usually mining
all the bazaar vendors only costs me in the tens of platinum. That's
easily made up for with one lucky find (blue diamonds, HQ pelts, green
goblin skins, etc).
