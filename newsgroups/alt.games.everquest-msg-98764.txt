OK, for those who think druids are useless for raids - learn to play
the game.

The ability to add 45-55 points to fire and cold resists. And these
stack with bard songs and mage damage shield.

Ready for this? Druids get debuffs! By stacking two spells druids can
reduce a mobs AC by 48 points, FR by 98, and attack by 60. And yes
these stack with the debuffs from mages and shaman.

Provide back crowd control using root/snare. Have more adds then the
tanks can offtank? Druid kites off an add and places it away from the
party.

The rest is obvious stuff - Backup/assist healing, transportation,
PotG, RotG, DoTs and DD spells.

A good druid is always doing something to assist in the success of a
raid. A druid won't make or break a raid, but they can be a key to
having fewer problems if properly played.
