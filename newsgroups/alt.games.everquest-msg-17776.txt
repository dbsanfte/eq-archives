Hell, i would burn all the files for everquest to a cd (though it would take
2). I have almost the same setup and it runs great. Just try and stay away
from Windows 2000 and EQ. Some people I know have endless problems and
others are fine. You shouldn't have to setup the account on the new comp,
since all account info is on Verant's servers. Just install everquest and
the expansions and then copy&paste the backed up files from the cds to the
everquest directory (make sure you have the same file system e.g. Fat or
such). I had once backed up the eq files from a win 2000 machine and
restored them on a win me machine so I wouldn't have to wait an hour to
redownload it and needless to say, that was a booboo. Good Luck
