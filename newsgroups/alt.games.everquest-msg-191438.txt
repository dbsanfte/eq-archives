You would be surprised how little information the enemy needs in order to
atack us. Things like:

"We usually make our parts runs in the morning."
"I hate getting up at 4 for guard duty."
"My truck is broken, so I'll be staying back an extra day."
"There's only 40 people in our camp right now, the rest don't show up until
Tuesday."

CNN isn't reporting everything, and even the most insignificant sounding
piece of information can be used against us.
For those in the know, it's called OPSEC.
