So both the mouse and keyboard are not working in the game?

I have had mouse and keyboard stop working when I got to character 
select but control-alt-delete still worked.  I was able to get to 
windows task manager and switch back to the game, then everything 
started working.  If you're running a version of windows that allows 
control-alt-delete to be disabled I'd suggest trying some other keys, 
like the windows key and Control-Escape to see if you can get a response.

If that doesn't work try turning on the windowed mode line in your 
EQClient.ini file to see if you can get it to start in windowed mode so 
you can get to windows more easily to diagnose the mouse and keyboard 
problems.
