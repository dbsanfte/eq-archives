My Level 9 Necro has spent all his life in Paineel and the Warrens.  I tried
going to Erudin yesterday to spread  my wings and see the world.

I con'd 'dubious' to all merchants in Erudin and even 'Threatening' to some
of the named NPC's.  How can I raise my faction in Erudin so I can buy
stuff?

And, is it possible to raise faction on the NPC's so I won't be KOS?  I
tried using the 'Gathering Shadows' invisibility spell, which did make it
possible to move around, as I con'd 'Indifferent' to everybody then.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.
