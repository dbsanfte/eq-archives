I must admit i wasn't playing for max efficiency, was reading my new
Stephen King novel while medding, so probably was full for a bit at
times, I know 30 is barely a hell level, I just don't feel like doing
much more than fuck around these days.  Bored with soloing, but my new
job put me on afternoons, so there is fuckall for other people to play
with when you log on around 11am EDT, esp since all the kiddies are back
in school (not that I really miss them).
