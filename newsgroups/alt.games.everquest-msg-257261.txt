I've bumped into this myself. In my case the problem had to do with the 
"current directory" the patcher is running from. Don't use any shortcut 
icons, try running EQ directly from the exe in the folder you copied 
over. If that resolves it, then recreate your shortcuts and try again 
with the shortcuts.
