I think they have better things to spend their development
time on.

Hell levels are just an artifact of the fact that you're
"moving into a higher exp bracket".  If they had done
the math right originally, there would be no hell levels,
*BUT* you'd still need the same total exp to move from,
say, level 1 to 49.  It would just be spread out more --
it wouldn't take as long to get through 45, but it would
take a bit longer to get through all the non-hell levels
to balance it out.

So in the long run, hell levels don't really matter a damn.
You'll still get to level X exactly as fast.  It's just
the psychological hit of seeing your exp bar slow down
in certain levels, and being that level longer than
you're used to.  But in the big picture it literally
makes no difference.

So there are three ways they can "fix" hell levels:

1.  Make a quick fix to "snip out" the extra exp needed
to get through a hell level, but leave other levels
the same as they are currently.  I think this is a *bad*
idea, because it's just another move towards a "Monty Haul"
game.

2.  "Smooth out" the exp curves to be the way they
should have been originally, and recalculate everyone's
exp during the patch downtime so that they remain at the
same number of bubbles into their current level.  Really,
why bother?  As I mentioned above, the long-term effect
would be zero, and would involve a lot of coding time.

3.  Either "snip out" or "smooth out" the exp curves,
then (as some people have suggested) "give" people
whatever new levels they would have "earned" using
their current exp under the new exp curves.  No, no,
no, no, and no.  You are whatever level you've already
earned, no more and no less.  You knew the old rules
and system, and you earned your levels under it.  You
don't deserve anything "free" just because they modify
how it's going to be done from here on out.  My Paladin
was level 40-something when they removed the hybrid
experience penalty, and some people were arguing
that we should "get" the extra 40% exp that we had
been "penalized" for two years, and gain some
insta-levels.  That would have been nice, but I was
against the idea even though it would have benefitted
me personally.

So overall, I really fail to see why they should
bother removing hell levels, or why anyone should
get themselves worked up over the prospect.
Done right, you won't get to level X any faster.
Done wrong, it's just caving in to some players'
wishes to remove anything in the game which keeps
them from "finishing" in three months.
