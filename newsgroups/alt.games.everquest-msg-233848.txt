If one theme is consistently higher, I can't say that it's been enough for
me to nice a difference.  I'm not sure what the best one was, but I do
remember the worst one.  A collect 21 in Mistmoore was over in 25 mobs -
total take with drops and vendor sales - 90pp.  That's not 90pp per party
member, that's 90pp for everybody.  I've run into some generous Mistmoore
missions and some very stingy ones.
