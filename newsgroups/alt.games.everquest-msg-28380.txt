From 29 to 34 a Shaman is a better primary healer then a Cleric. This is the
only time frame this is true at 34 the Cleric will get Superior Heal and at
39 complete heal Shaman and Druids have to wait till 51 to get Superior
Heal. Also 1 slight advantage to having a Cleric from 29-34 is Revive for
tanks not wanting to run through dangerous zones naked. At 34 nothing can
touch a Cleric as a healer and for Sheilding Buffs
