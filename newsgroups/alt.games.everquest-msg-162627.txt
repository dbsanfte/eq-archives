I'd be curious to get an opinion or two...I am interested in getting
an item from a fairly low level spawn, easy to obtain, not much of a
challange, just lots of patience/time between spawns. I want this item
for my own use, however, there is one person with what appears to be
mutiple accounts/toons that camps this spawn 24x7, keeps a timer set,
and has been doing so for over a month now.   I have asked if I can
get in the rotation and the person refuses to budge from the camp.   I
have been told by another player that even though we generally honor
camps, that in reality, GMs do not, and if I happen to get close and
the mob spawns and engages me, it's mine...and if the other person
interfers, thats a KS, and GMs  do care about that. ??   I do not know
this to be a fact, but have considered a petition to find out for
sure.   I am not looking for a comfrontation or trying to cause
trouble, I just dont think farming to this extent should be
acceptable.
