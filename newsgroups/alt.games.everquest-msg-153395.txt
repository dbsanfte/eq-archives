There is another ongoing thread that addresses this very subject.  EQW will
let you run EQ in a window, and allow you to do whatever else you want with
EQ running.  There is no guaranteed way of being able to switch out of EQ
with EQ running normally, it will likely shut down EQ, or, not allow you to
switch back.  Some people can work around this, but not all.
