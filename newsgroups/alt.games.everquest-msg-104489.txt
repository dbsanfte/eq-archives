The thread about the cleric who didn't want to heal and draw aggro got me 
thinking (well, actually not wanting to do any real work got me thinking 
about EQ, but the result is the same).  Anyway, there seem to be some 
number of EQ players who don't like to die, and focus their playstyle on 
not dying, generally only fighting the safest mobs, with an overpowering 
group and easy escape.  This is a perfectly legitimate way to play, though 
I certain don't follow this path.
I remember when I was a young bard and dying all the time speaking to 
people who claimed to never die.  In fact I thik I remember people posting 
here about only dying 2-3 times before they hit 50.  I don't like dying, 
and have never liked dying, but I seemed to have a knack for it, so I 
concentrated on getting good at CR to at least alleviate the downtime.  I 
log all the time, and so have a pretty good idea of how many times I've 
died.  Lets just say that it's way too many, and that I can only confirm a 
single level with more than 50 deaths.
That being said, are there any 50+ character here who have died less than 
10 times?  Two years ago it was not uncommon for people to brag about 
having only died X (for some small value for X) times, but I don't see 
much of that anymore.  Is it that death is an unavoidable part of the 
high-end game, those who don't like death burn out sooner, or do they just 
not come here anymore?
