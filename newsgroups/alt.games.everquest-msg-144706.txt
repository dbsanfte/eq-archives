I recently ran into a web site for an up coming RPG that
wouldn't load at all.  Instead a box popped up informing
me that I needed IE5 or higher to view that site.  I've
now forgotten the name of that game, and instead I've been
playing Morrowind all this past week.  (a break from EQ!)
Morrowind's site works just fine with Netscape, although
I did have to update one of my plug-ins.  That's how it
goes.  Forget me and I forget you!  ;-)

When I encounter a retailer whose site I can't use, I
shoot the proprietor an email and point out that I just
spent $$ with their competitor(s) instead of them, and
I give them the url of the site that worked.

It's their choice.  Competition is fierce, and the winners
are willing to work harder than the losers.
