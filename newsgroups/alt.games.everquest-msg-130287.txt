Much of my PvP experience has been with lower level clerics.  Their
specialty in PvP seems to be masters of escaping their opponents.

--With metal armor, their Gate spells don't get interrupted as badly as
other caster's.
--The old "Flash of Light" and run (or Gate)  trick works very well.
--Divine Aura has a lot more uses on PvP servers.
--If you were lucky enough to obtain a Shining Star of Light before the
quest was broken, the Cleanse proc has been known to clear off Root spells.
--"Cure Poison" works wonders for removing Enchanter Tashans and Rogue
poisons.

As far as damage output goes, Clerics need a really really good 2hblunt
weapon, or don't even bother.  If you try Clerical nuking in PvP, you'll
often find your mana runs out before your target's hp's do.

So if you're into PK'ing, clerics would be challenging at best.  But if you
want to play in a PvP environment without actually doing much of the PK'ing,
then you might find it an interesting class to play.
