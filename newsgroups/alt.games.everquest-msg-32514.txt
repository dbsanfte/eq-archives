Root and snare will give you the same effect, while being more reliable and
less mana intensive.  Once rooted, you can meditate with a minimum of fuss.
Both snare and root would have to break at the same time in order for you to

I didn't say druid fear kiting wouldn't work or that some people wouldn't do
it, just that you have better options.
