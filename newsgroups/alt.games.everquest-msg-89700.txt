    Are you preserving Giant faction even though you're killing Tormax? It
might be worth your while to get CoV up for a few days to snag a BoB.

    Aye, my level 40 Iksar Monk has half his Steel shackle. I imagine with a
personal porter/tracker and the ability to lay waste to anything that looks
remotely like a PH it goes faster, though.

    Kwinn, at least, is easier to get now. The frogloks and leeches used to
kill him off, but ever since they gave him his new friend he stays around a
lot longer. Which is good, as one branch of the extended quest now has you
go do his mechanical tail quest. Sorta logically inconsistant - unless you
did the tail quest earlier, THEN killed him you'd need to go do a quest with
someone you already killed - but people won't notice, right?

    Yep, another whoops. And the turn-in not working for the resonant bone
chips at first - yet another whoops. If I was serious about getting the
Celestial Fists this way, I'd call a GM to witness the turn-in so I could
get the Fists back if something's goofy.

    See the Kwinn comment above, although that is just one branch of several
the quest can take at that point. And I don't see why Veltar should be
limited to one zone - we have Opal Darkbriar, and that storyteller for the
Warrior epic, and.... :-)
