No, aggro for the spells has been pretty much the same since before
Kunark (exception, they cut the aggro on one line of Necro spells,
that forced the SKs to switch which L9 spell they use for aggro).
The difference is the enormous increase in mana regen, coupled with
mad mudflation that has seriously diluted the Warrior tanking edge,
well beyond the adjustments during Kunark and early Velious that
made Knights functional as tanks.  It used to be that caster DPS
was mana limited (and so Wizards were just as unwanted during the
Kunark era as Knights), so group agro management was mostly a matter
of don't do your nuking at the start of the fight and have the Monk
FD once in a while.  With the much higher mana regen of today, along
with focus items and AAs that improve casting efficiency, casters
are at least as likely to be aggro limited as mana limited.  Add to
that those very hard-hitting PoP (and LDoN "hard") mobs which you
want to slow ASAP and the Knight's ability to quickly build very
high hate has become hugely popular, so popular that Warriors are
spending unaccustomed time sitting on the sideline LFG.  It's not
as bad as Kunark was for the Knights, but that doesn't make it fun.
And we all play for fun, eh?
