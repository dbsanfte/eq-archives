If you make it to level 24 or 25 and like the game I would get LDON then.  You
can't do LDON before level 21, and its hard to find groups at the lower levels
anyway.  Whether or not you'll really *like* LDON depends on your play style.  
It's great for me since I only have a few hours to play in the evening, and
clerics are pretty group dependent.
