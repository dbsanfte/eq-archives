When I'm running my beasty and my mage I like to get the mage into
a low maintenence position.  Because I use a KVM to swap between machines,
the ability to leave him stationary, preferably mounted, is huge.  Then
I just have to use the keypad I have attached to that machine to control
him.

Against Xanamech I don't use bolts, but I do have a Wand
of the Ice Storm, ERIV - so my other nukes reach when he is parked up
the wall - and he doesn't get ae'd there.

My experiences slowing with my 'chanter (mobs much higher level than him
that were debuffed by my mage) and the observations of mage's with regard
to their epic landing its procs support a 10 level limit on landing spells.

Xanamech is level 66 - so my BL should, by all the info I have, been able
to land his ice nukes.  Unless I was 55 then - but I don't remember taking
him on regular guild raids before he hit 56.  I might have, since this was
a small one.  In fact, now that I think on it, I didn't have him added to
the raid roster (for RPP and the like) until he was 56, but I did take him
to "non-critical" raids before that.

(btw - anyone know how to add stat food to a profile?  I tried the

available.)
