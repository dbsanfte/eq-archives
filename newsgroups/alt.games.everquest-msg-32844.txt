<snip post about chat-window>

Before I started on the 3d world, I've played a few command line mud's.
There was a good program called zMud. There was a sort of "program
interface" which gave you the opportunity to filter the text coming from the
game. You could do anything you wanted with that text, including building
triggers and, more useful, relocate the lines of text to different windows.
After a while I had something like 6 screens up with all the different sort
of texts coming by. Loot, combat, chat, self-damage (tracking health status
with some formulas) and a few others.

I can understand that Verant doesn't want to include triggers, but having
modifiable windows would definitely be a good move.
