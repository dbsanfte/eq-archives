Have you given any thought to Lavastorm? At 12, you can hunt fire
drakes and the rare elemental. Fire imps too, but kill them
fast. Don't mess witht he lava basilisks. They'll keep you so stunned
it's not funny. It's a neat zone though, and relatively lightly
populated. Plus, if you're a DE it's close to home :)
