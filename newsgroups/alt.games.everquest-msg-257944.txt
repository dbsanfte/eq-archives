It is indeed just one additional mana per tic.  Not a whole lot really. 
  The most you can ever have of these will add up to 15 extra mana per tic.

While it may not seem like much, consider that currently you probably 
get one mana per tic standing and two per tic sitting... a single point 
of mana regen would double your standing regen to two per tic (but only 
add half again to your sitting, because it doesn't multiply, so you'd 
get 3 per tic instead of 2)

As you level up the effect will be less astonishing, you'll still get a 
big boost while standing but less and less of one while sitting, because 
your sit mana regen will go up as your meditation skill rises.

Most things in EQ work like this, though; you see a 5% or 10% raise in 
effectiveness with an upgrade in gear, at best.  The idea is that adding 
together a bunch of 5% improvements gets you up to a more significant total.

There's also diminishing returns involved; while that first point of 
mana regen may double your standing regen rate, the second point will 
only give you half that again (from 2 to 3) and the third will only give 
you a third that (from 3 to 4) and so on.  Yet each point will take more 
and more effort to get; the easy one you've already got, this one is 
harder to achieve.

Why mana regen is so hard to come by while hp regen is comparatively 
easy is another topic entirely...
