And a Geerlok device will help cut down on failure rate and raise your
tradeskill by 5% (translates to +10 at 200, +11 at 220, +12 at 240,
etc) but still won't help speed up the skillup.  If you don';t have a
gnome with high tinker skill to make one, you can find almost all
Geerlok devices in bazaar for under 50pp (cheapest was 15pp for
brewing)
