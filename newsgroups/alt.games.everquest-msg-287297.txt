At some point, they will probably have to look at providing a leveling 
shortcut of some sort to ease reaching 70 or so, such that joining the 
majority of remaining active players in a game this old is doable either for 
someone new or existing player's alts.

DAoC allowed players with one level cap toon to start alts at something like 
level 20 or 25 I think it was. More recently, WoW ramped up the experience 
rate from levels 20 to 60 in a game that was already easy to level up in.

I don't think I like the idea of starting at a fixed level, skipping early 
levels. I do like the idea of increasing the experience in the midrange 
levels to make them go by more easily. I think they've done some great 
things in making it a lot easier with reduced downtime, hotspots that 
encourage the smaller numbers of those leveling to do so in common spots 
making groups more likely to be possible, etc. But looking at the haul to 80 
from zero on a new character today it would be nice if the levels from 50 to 
70 in particular had the experience ramped up some.

Alternatively, expanding on the LoTD might be good also. I'd like to see it 
go to an hour and I would also like to see any enabled account have it 
available for ALL characters on that account. I'd also like to see it coded 
such that if I delete some alt and roll a new one, the new one gets it on a 
veteran account. I don't think this is a big deal, trivializes the game nor 
unbalances it in any way. It's a great idea but I think they were too stingy 
with it as well as the other vet aa.
