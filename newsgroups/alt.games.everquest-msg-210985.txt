If I could drop LoH or HT for Tracking on either of my Knights (well, any of
my knights,  that should be, since I have 2 SK's) I would. Tracking has
helped me complete untold amounts of quests with my Druid (bot) or my Ranger
(both on Bristlebane and FV)

Super cool? You ever played a Knight Class? Ok so LoH is a get out of CR
free card and has saved my Pally twink on a couple of occasions but HT is at
best a good way to drop a runner or grab aggro in an instant...levelx 10 +1
damage, ooh 351 dam at 35th once a (EQ) day, no contest. Give me the
tracking ability and non-animal aggro of a Ranger any day.

Go for it, there must be something about the class that your play style
doesn't suit but, believe me, the grass is NOT greener.

Rangers are the most versatile of all Melee classes. Being able to SoW and
buff yourself (Attck ,HP, AC and DS) not to mention snare and root. Oh sure
Archery at lower levels is not the awesome DPS it is at the higher ones but
it's the same as a Warriors which with the right bow and a snare and root or
two will weaken a mob significantly before it gets to melee stage, where
your attack buffs make you the equal or better of Warriors and at higher
level there isn't much contest.
What? You need money for the "right" bow...oh well that's where tracking
comes in, see not only can you find those little rare spawns for quests you
can easily track down those mobs that drop trade supplies...Not that you'd
use tracking...It sucks, all it's good for is pulling.

TBH I actually thought you're a Troll and, having seen all the recent Ranger
posts, are after some attention...but maybe I am wrong in which case...Try
another melee just don't delete your Ranger, you may find you want to play
him again on the tenth time you go to press the Track Hot Key and it's not
there.
