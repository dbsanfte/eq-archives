Don't paladins get root?  How about fear undead?  Either would give you
a head start on what admittedly is a  long haul for the zone.  You do
have means to exit a fight other than death or victory, even in a bad

have to disagree.  If you want to explore you have to do so within the
limits of the class you are playing.  For some classes that might mean
look but don't touch in some spots, or at least be prepared with an exit
strategy.
