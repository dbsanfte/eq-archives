Heh, my mother used to always say 'Jesus Criminently'.  I'm still not sure 
exactly what it means, other than that I should stop doing that right now.

Heh... I've been around a lot of other people's kids lately, and gotten to 
re-watch a bunch of those... It kind of scares me that we expose kids to 
such things.  Bambi's mom getting shot, witches giving people poisoned 
apples, blahblahblah.

But hey, beats the heck out of Barney or Pokemon. :) Or WWF wrestling.  
I can't believe people actually let their kids watch such blatant 
glorification of violence.  But I guess we all have our funny little 
prejudices.
