Bards haste sucks, unless you have a haste already and its a high level bard who
has the sort of haste that stacks... otherwise, if you want haste, get an
enchanter or shaman.  Lacking a real haster, Bard haste can fill the gap, giving
you at least -some- haste.  But its nothing compared to real haste.

Bard slows suck, at all levels; unlike their haste they don't stack with real
slows.  Again if you cant' get a real slow, bard slow is in the "better than
nothing" category.

Bard mana regen is nice, no question.  But if its a choice between KEI and bard
mana, take the KEI.  Bard mana always stacks with chanter mana, though, and
everyone elses, so here they come out looking good, unlike their haste and slow
contributions.

Melee damage, yea, not as much as a cleric, but they do outdamage wizards,
enchanters, mages, druids and necromancers in melee (not counting the pets melee
most of those classes contribute).

Puller; I'm sad to say my bard was never called on much to pull, although I do
it with glee; heck, my cleric got asked to pull more than my bard.  Not sure
why, bards are indeed well equipped for the task, as well as anyone without FD
can be, and they have lull to compensate, plus track.

You didn't mention some of the bards' better contributions; decent crowd control
(mez and charm, used well, can control five adds with fair reliability while
grinding two of those adds down by having them fight each other), DS that stacks
with other DS, short duration DOTs that also serve as resist debuffs (*short
duration is good in case you end up having to mez a mob thats been dotted, since
you can keep the DOT on the mob continuously, the short duration doesn't mean it
actually wears off early if the mob is supposed to be dying), and snare.  Snare
is your friend.  I don't bring up bard fear here because I feel that its a weak
contribution at best, comperable to their haste/slow abilities.

Rogue, mage, wizard, necromancer, beastlord all > monk for DPS.  If it was only
rogue, I'd say second best is still ok, after all, you can't always get that one
ideal class.  But five classes, its not going to be hard to find something
better.  Six classes if circumstances are right for a ranger to do real damage.

I think I'd have to agree, but that doesn't make them a highly desired class.

Warriors can tank, but not well, like monks can DPS but not well.  If you are
going to count warriors as tanks for exp groups you might as well count monks
for DPS.... well maybe not, warriors can probably fill in for knights better
than monks can fill in for the better DPS classes.  Druids, like bards, have a
lot of "well we can't get a real class that does that" abilities, both are jack
of all trades sorts, capable of filling several different sorts of holes
depending on what your group needs.

I'd say more, based on the discussion we've just had.  Either they need some
special contribution they make better than anyone else, or they need a DPS boost
to bring them up to competitive with the other DPS classes, or they need a good
chunk of their mitigation restored so they are possible tanks.  Since there are
currently only three tank classes, and seven DPS classes, I'd lean to restoring
mitigation, personally, from a game balance standpoint.  But perhaps the best
solution would be to make it so high level mobs forget about FD'd people most of
the time, instead of rarely; once upon a time the no cast time FD was a monk's
real claim to fame, but as we fight level 55+ mobs more and more, this ability
has become more and more useless in efficient exp grouping.  Lets see, besides
making them forget less, adding a monk only throwable snare item would also help
a lot, SK and necro end up doing a lot of the FD splitting just because of what
they can do with combining snare and FD together.  Since necros are better DPS
and SK are better tanks, restoring  monks to best pullers would  be a decent
solution.  But to do that, you'd have to give them more mitigation; if you want
them to not be tanks, make some sort of discipline that gives great mitigation
under pulling situations but that won't work while tanking, say it turns off the
ability to attack or something along those lines.
