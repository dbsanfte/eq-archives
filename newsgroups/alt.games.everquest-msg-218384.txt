Okay, fine, I'll take the burden.

His premise seems to be that punch card voting has been working fine
for a long time.  It hasn't.  Instead, we've just been ignoring the
known problems for decades.  Examples:

In 1996, a Democratic primary for a House seat in Massachusetts
resulting in a very close election.  That election had the same
punch card/chad issue our most recent presidential election had.

In 1990, a similar event happened in Illinois.  That time it was
a Republican primary for a position in the state legislature.

It also happened in Alaska in 1987.

It also happened in Indiana in 1981.

In each case, the courts were involved, and the ineffectiveness of
the punch card system was called into question.  Chads were debated
and the courts made hard decisions.

Was the Nov. 2000 presidential election some kind of anomaly?  No.
It was completely predictable based on similar problems occuring in
the past.  Khosh's argument that punch card voting has been working
forever and ever -- amen -- is bullshit.  Just like I said.

Okay, enough of those kind of examples, which are historical facts
that can be verified through web searches.  There are many more
examples of punch card voting problems, but giving you four solid
examples seems reasonable.  Do you agree?

: At worst, Khosh was guilty of a denial of the antecedent fallacy, but
: that doesn't render his argument false.

Consider it rendered false now.  Can I officially pass the burden back
to him?

There is also quite a bit of evidence against Khosh's bullshit claims
that come from experts in voting systems themselves.  If necessary,
I'll do the leg work there too, and pull out lots of choice quotes
of elections officials and voting systems experts saying punch card
systems suck big, green donkey dicks.  And those quotes will come from
well before the Nov. 2000 presidential election.
