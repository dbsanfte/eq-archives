Hmmm lotsa good stuff out there so I will offer what meager advice as
I can. 
First find something that procs no later than level 20, that's when
you will start having trouble hitting things. Many good items have int
and procs, think dagger of frost is one that can be had around 200-250
or less.  Always cast grim aura before melee it helps. Any other stats
are a bonus. check out the web sites for ideas but use the quoted
prices as a relative guild only. good luck
