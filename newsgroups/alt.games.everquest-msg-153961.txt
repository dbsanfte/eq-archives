Hm, here's an interesting thought... I was wondering why they'd do 4 major 
nerfs all at once.  Perhaps, they'll see which one causes the most 
whining, and then take that one back to appease us, and meanwhile, they've 
managed to slip in three nerfs without annoying us as much.  So, probably, 
either the monk situation or the mod rod situation, I'll bet only gets 
nerfed half as much as announced.
