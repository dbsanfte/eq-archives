You are right, I think thats one thing thats stopped me migrating to one of the
"new" servers where starting over like this would be possible.  If Morell Thule got
wiped, you'd have level 50 people on it in a week, most of them the people that are
least fun to play with.

Further, one nice thing about a high end guild that isn't "uber" is that its
populated with people from the slow and steady and meteoric rise camps, from the
"three nights a week" and the "8 hours a day" types both, since you don't see
people leveling past the guild or leveling so slow the guild leaves them behind.
Start over, though, and I'd be 20 in a week, with guildmates who would be 40 and
others still at 10; the whole thing would tend to fragment.
