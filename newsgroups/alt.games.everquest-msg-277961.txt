...I realize I said that in the quote wrong. "It says they don't have
any philosophical objection to people doing it when they go through
them".

Anyway, the point is, this isn't giving up any control of their IP.
This is, in fact, extending their control even farther. It's entirely
possible that, by legitimizing these sales when sanctioned through
them, they have even more ammo to fire at IGE. In fact, they have
something to point to that they can more easily show financial damages
should they try to sue IGE.

They never had a philosophical objection to these sales. They had a
philosophical objection to people doing it WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT.
