One person hands in an item to a quest mob but the quest is not complete.
Next person hands in the completed item(s)

At it's most basic, you could turn in one 3 bone chips to the NPC in
Felwithe and when someone else turns in one bone chip they get the trumpet
sound and reward(s)

On a more advanced level, I have for instance chain gloves from WToV farming
in my bank. These are no drop. However if I can find a chain wearing PC that
has at least one gem for those gloves I can hand in the gloves and two gems
(with ally faction in this case) and the person with one gem can then
complete the quest by handing in one of the three required gems.

Person doing the last hand in gets the item.
