lol!  You shoulda told him "50 plat? You're on!" and then bitched at him 
and threatened to petition when he refused ;).  I've had an ex-guild 
member (who was a real dick while in the guild - a tank who let me take 
an add and die while he stood there watching, ninja-looted an item he 
couldn't use and refused to give it to the person who'd asked for it 
before we even started fighting the thing...) send me tells in the 
middle of fights asking me to get him in my group, to take him to SK, 
etc, etc, etc... when I told him we were full he started bitching, when 
I told him to go get a map, his statement (despite the fact that I'd 
nagged everyone to visit the webpage - which included a link to eqmaps - 
while he was in the guild, and despite the fact that he was an officer) 
was "where the fux am I supposed to get a map?"  I gave him the URL and, 
an hour later when I camped out, he was still shouting for someone to 
port him to NK or show him the way to EK.

Anyway.  Yes.  Personal tells.  I usually *never* send them, but in both 
cases, it was me and one other person in the zone.  Like I said, it was 
late.  I checked N Qey, Qey Hills, and BB for obvious binders before I 
gave up and asked the person in each zone if they could possibly give me 
a hand.
