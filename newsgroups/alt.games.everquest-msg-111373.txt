Adam, I would imagine that if I did a google search on all newsgroups, I
could probably find someone espousing just about any position on just about
any topic.  There is no doubt in my mind that, more than once, someone
somewhere in some newsgroup has attacked Christianity.  Of course the same
is true, I am sure, of Wicca, Judaism, Islam, pretty much any religion you
would care to name, and I am sure we can add Atheism to the list of things
attacked as well.  It certainly does not surprise me you were able to find
an article attacking religion in general.  I'm sure you can find more.
