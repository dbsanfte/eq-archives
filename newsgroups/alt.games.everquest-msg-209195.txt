I can understand you wanting to leave the game now that it is so stupid with
all the easy ways to get to level 10 for newbies.  It seems like most people
play with 2 boxes and can powerlevel themselves, so this leaves a hard deal
with giving things away to newbies.  I always liked it when people would go
to a newbie zone and ask for 5 or 6 items any newbie could get for trade of
a good item, but it seems most people could careless for a good item now
because they can just take their high level and camp it themselves.

Hope you find a cool way to give your stuff away.
