>>Of course if it's anything like Buying Magic the Gathering cards you'll
have extremely broke 12 year olds and strange 55 year olds all over the
country paying/playing it. <<


That's the main reason I stopped playing M:TG. I started playing the game
when there were nothing but Alpha/Beta cards, happily shuffling them till
the faces wore off, slapping them around the table, holding the decks
together with rubber bands ...

Tell that story now, and people look at you with utter horror. The game
degenerated from "who can build the best deck with the cards they got from
their trading skills" to "who can build the best deck by going out and
buying all the ultra rare cards from the local hobby store." Pathetic.

Although the premise of that new game does look cool ... sort of a Starship
Trooper feel. I might pop in to look since it's free, but I doubt I'll pay
any money to upgrade my equipment.
