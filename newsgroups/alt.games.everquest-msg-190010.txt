Hmm... so how would you operate with a Raid Force... with deaths and
rezones etc?  is it the fact that your in a group/raid that you will
enter the same dungeon as the rest?
what about the group in another version of the dungeon, who needs a
rez but the group is full and no rezer in group... How would ya invite
a cleric to join you in that particular dungeon?  
How bout Link Dead... do you re spawn outside of dungeon? How does it
know what version of the dungeon you belong to since your group was
broken?

I agree... the idea of a Iron man server sounds fun, but I don't think
id be playing on it.
