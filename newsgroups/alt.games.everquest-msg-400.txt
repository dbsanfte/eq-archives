In 99% of the case, if someone is running from a train towards the area,
they will be yelling in /say "TRAIN!"

Thus giving you enough time to:

A) Turn around to asess where the train is and react.
B) Get up from your spellbook
C) Make a decision to end your battle by retreating

Remeber, trains only happen because of players. They are not random computer
generated occurances. A player should always be responsible for any trains
he/she creates. They should make the zone aware by all channels, such as
ooc, shout, and say. There are a lot of people who have on or more of the
channels shut off due to all the spam, so it is the player's job to get the
info to the others. If they do not, they are simply a bad player and should
just go play Miscrosoft hearts or something.
