Spies is an issue im gonna bring up on a later post.  Ive alway utilized these
and I dont use them for war, as that was my first war.  My pally was always a
member and didnt need insertion. I think the 5 guys who went in with me should
get a medal.  You guilders out therre know how hard it is to pull off something
that really wasnt that hard.  Everybodys either campin this   or theyre workin,
or theyre chcken, or whatever.   These 5 guys opened the floodgates.  They
showed what could be done with a little coordination.  Guild chat is active and
encouraging.  Ty for your kind words
