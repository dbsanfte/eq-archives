However, it is frequently the level of the caster that is mroe important than the
level of the spell. I regularly use my level 1 (druid) snare spell rather than my
L19 one, simply because it saves on mana in a chain-pulling situation.

It is a balance, they couldn't give everything to one class, now, could they?

Regardless of tping, a wizard is always good in any group because of the sheer
amount of damage they can pour out in a short time. If your tank(s) is/are low on
hp it's nice to know that the wizard can finish off a mob that is at say 1/4 to
1/3 hp pretty much on his/her own with sufficient mana reserves.

I've never seen anyone not drag their corpse to a safer spot for the cleric to do
the res. Well, I've seen it. the results are often somewhere between humorous and
deadly.

Yeah what's the point of this, anyway? Tunare forgive the poor SOB who needs to
do a CR in permafrost when they are bound much farther away than Qeynos.

A Druid: snare, several roots, ensnare, several dot roots, and a dot/debuff root
if I am not mistaken at very high levels.

What is with this rating of classes on things that aren't their business anyway?
nobody rates an Accountant on his or her ability to tell a good joke.

Sure, but, I have had little trouble chain-pulling at the giant fort in FM with
myself and my gf (druid and monk) for 1 yellow an hour minimum each.

Err...that IS the druid pet, for a long time.

Plus the ability at higher levels to...ah...lycanthropize <chuckle> the entire
group.

Plus the fact that every druid worth his/her salt maintains at elast sow if not
better on all group members, especially the puller.

Being the most flexible class around, with the hats of porter, nuker, healer,
buffer (especially with the L49 Skin like Nature which is ac, hp, regen and
breeze all in one) and many miscellaneous spells to boot, there is much mroe to
look at than just the ability to tp/evac.

Simply not using the taunt (a good taunter reserves it so that it's up say, when
the wizard throws too many DD's and gets the aggro) will do.

hear, hear :)

Easily four, there is nothing quite like finishing off a mob by having a
low-on-hp monk bandage himself or the person who takes the aggro, since bandaging
*does not* take the aggro, under any circumstances. Also, bandaging to 50% (or
75% when high enough level) after a fight is a good way to save on healer mana.

Certain monk-only weapons have debuffing procs.


I notice that the vast majority of the discussion revolves around the classes at
levels most people will never see. While everything is indeed valid, it concerns
only a fraction of the overall player base.
