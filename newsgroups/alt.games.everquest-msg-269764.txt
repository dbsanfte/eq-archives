Replace.  But apparently it's not an easy job on the old Wings.  Plus,
they're getting hard to find.  The bike's an '83.

And for an added bonus, on the way home today I started smoking around
the bottom.  Then the oil alert started coming on when I came off the
line.  Looks like I've just developed a pressure leak.  About 1 drop
every 10 seconds when it's not running, and a fast-forming puddle when
it is.

I may have just lost the bike for the winter, and depending on what
needs to be done, maybe the whole engine.  That's a thousand-plus job,
if/when they can get a rebuilt.  Checking tomorrow.
