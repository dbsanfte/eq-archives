Last year I quit EQ; I'm away travelling for almost 6 months, and then 
when the season is on here I end up so busy making swords and keeping my 
several different renaissance business running in the fall that I didn't 
play much during September and October either.  So I shut off the account.

I'm not all that busy in November or December, though, and eventually I 
got the Online Jones again, which I took care of with Anarchy Online; 
they had a free play offer out, and I had a good time with them, even 
managing to play over my cell phone connection while I was travelling. 
AO has a much more complicated character development system than EQ< and 
I had a great time fiddling around with different classes and so on.  In 
the end though, I got to the point where I'd tried everything out, and I 
found that the game world itself wasn't particularly engaging, I 
gradually lost interest.

When we got back from the road, my son had expressed a desire to start 
playing EQ again.  We developed a plan, once the fall season started 
we'd buy him a new computer (his is really old and buggy, won't run EQ 
or half the other games he's interested in) and both start EQ 
characters, which would play together as a team.

In the interim, I restarted my old EQ account, and we started playing 
around with characters just for fun, and to give him a chance to learn 
the game better (the difference in play ability between 7 and 8 is 
pretty large).

I got involved in a AGE project, making a character without access to 
the Bazaar or any twinking of any sort, had some fun with that for a while.

Then the season really kicked in, and I got so busy making weapons that, 
like the year before, I ended up not playing anything at all, my limited 
time on the net was spent checking email, researching historical sword 
designs and monitoring the AGE newsgroup (but rarely even speaking up on 
it).

Turns out, with rising fuel costs, disasters and weather cutting into 
Faire attendance, and so on, that we couldn't afford that new computer 
this year after all.  And my son gradually stopped playing EQ as well, 
neither of us have touched it since mid October or so.

So I shut it down again, cash is tight enough that there's no reason to 
be spending that 15 a month on somethign we aren't even playing anymore.

Maybe next year
