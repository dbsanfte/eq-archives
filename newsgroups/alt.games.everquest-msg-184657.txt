Cancel Magic is not random. If it removes anything, it starts from the top
right side. If you have two buffs, for example, then a mob casts Root on
you, unless the buffs have lapsed, they will be the first spells removed.
That's why you find that most folks cast crap buffs first, then they cast
the real buffs. I, for example, cast JBoots, See Invisible, and Infravision
on myself first before I get C3, even though I am a gnome with a necklace
that sees invisible.
