The best place in the world for getting bone chips is the Paineel newbie
garden. Endless supply of bone chips and right next to the warrens
which is a great place to hunt at your level.

You'll be KOS in paineel city but you can always go up to shadowhaven
to sell as you're right next to the portal. And it's not all that difficult
to become
non-kos in paineel either.
