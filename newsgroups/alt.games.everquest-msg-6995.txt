having played my wizard up to 42 (and working on getting her higher), my
recommendation would be to get a staff of writhing.
decent damage, and at level 28, it procs a spell that does 48 dmg.
however, once you're at about my level, you really won't be meleeing.
period. it just doesn't happen, so the type of weapon you use isn't THAT
important, IMO.
I don't even have a viable weapon that I equip. I do equip a staff of the
wheel, but the dmg to delay ratio is laughable, so it's not used for melee,
it's used for the int.
I also have a staff of temperate flux that I don't equip. I keep it in an
inventory slot, to activate the "LowerElement" effect (lowers fire and cold
resists on a mob, when it doesn't get resisted itself...helpful for soloing)
this is a quest only item, no drop, and not something you'd want to attempt
at your level without lots of help. and not the greatest for a melee weapon.
but as I said, you won't really be meleeing at my level.
