In fact the OP makes it quite clear in his emails that he was using the word
in its offensive sense, to mean coward. Just because he's ignorant of the
derivation of that sense of the word, doesn't make it any less offensive.

I love the OPs use of dictionary definitions to support himself, when none
of them is even close to the sense in which he openly admitted to using the
word!
