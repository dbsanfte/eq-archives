I keep hearing about all these raids and high level zones, which I look
forward to...eventually.  But last night, I decided to take a break from
working on tailoring and go for some experience for a while.  So I got
in a pickup group at Orc 2.  It was myself (6 Necro), an 11 pally and a
7 enchanter.  And we had everything perfectly in sync.  We we killing
orc after orc.  Everything was timed perfectly.  I had the Beatles
playing in the background and I was just jamming with the fighting and
the music.  All told, in an hour and a half, I ended up with a little
over 5 yellow bubs, 6 orc belts and the 'Chanter gave me some +int
armour that she didn't need(much better than my current cloth/silk
garb).

 ...which leaves me with one question, will I be able to turn in the
belts as a DE necro?
