If you have a 20% rez, then a necro's pet isn't going to be breaking 
root unless he's equipped with some kind of proccing weapon, which 
doesn't seem too likely... its possible but not likely.  Melee doesn't 
break root, you need DD (some root and stun and DOT spells have initial 
DD component, which means these can do it too... but in every case its 
the DD doing the breaking)

Looking at your group, who's the puller?  Shaman?  Warrior?  Necro? 
Cleric or cleric+warrior are the ones I'd vote for, but Necro is a 
possibility.  I can't tell from your description, though.

Yep, its very tempting when your group mates are clearly clueless.  On 
an LDoN run, though, I feel its dishonorable to cut and run, turning a 
probablility into a certainty; I'll stick around and try my best, after 
all, I'm on the hook for the loss the second I go in, unless we can pull 
off a success.

Root parking is a simple basic tactic that everyone should learn... but 
it sounds like you are at the level when many people first encounter it. 
  Since Mez parking is a lot more dangerous for the mezzer when people 
don't understand it, try to shrug off your difficulties by thinking how 
much worse it is for enchanters, bards, and the rare necro who realizes 
she too is a mez class.   (since you didn't suggest this far superior 
plan, I assume you too didn't know that that necro of yours could have 
been mezzing instead of you having to struggle with root as a substitute)

At your probable level, any sort of rez is pretty much a waste of time, 
unless its as  a form of transportation.

What made the pet go out of control?  Normally it will stick on its 
initial target, and only go after whatever hit its master once that is 
dead.  Necro spamming back off can get the pet onto something else, but 
has to do so deliberately, and even so it won't wander around picking 
stuff at random, it will only go after mobs that hit its master -after- 
the "back off" message, or that its master told it to attack after that 
message, or that hit it after that point.  Back off means "forget all 
about anything I told you to attack or that attacked us"

Necro running around like an idiot is quite possible, I've done it as a 
mage; back off pet and try to get it onto whats beating me up, and I 
have to move because if I'm next to the mob it will never switch to my 
pet.  But a necro would be more idiotic to do this, because she's got FD 
and can just lie down until things are under control.

There are some forms of armor with no appearance.  And for a caster, 
honestly, most gear is a waste of time and money, barring focus items 
you aren't likely much better off in a set of gear running a thousand 
plat than you are in a full set of small cloth, or naked for that 
matter.  Plus naked there's no worry about recovering your body.

On the other hand, there are certainly some males playing on the Lara 
Croft plan; playing an attractive female cause they are going to spend 
65 levels looking at something, might as well be something fun to look at.

And for that matter, there are certainly a contingent of females out 
there with "wives", although in most countries in the world the quotes 
will have to remain in place for a few more years.

My gut feeling is that there are more Mangina than lesbian players out 
there, but I can't back that up with statistics.
