Well, I found her. I had gone to SH to find her after
the first comment, checked everyone out and no lion
meat. That's when I posted here. So...after you all
insisted she was there, I went back and, lo and
behold, once I tilted my vision down a bit, there
she was. :) I had totally overlooked her the first
time. Thanks, all.
