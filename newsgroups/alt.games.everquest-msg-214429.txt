My Regal Ring of Bathezid doesn't have a slot, but that might be because
it can be turned in to be recharged, which would probably destroy the
augmentation.  My Necklace of Whispering Winds doesn't have one either
though, and the only unusual thing about it is that it's a Sky quest
item.  *shrug*

Oddly enough the Tattered Silk Boots I have in the bank have a slot,
even though their only purpose is to be turned in as part of a quest.
With so many items there had to be a few that got overlooked...  :)
