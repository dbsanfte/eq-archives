Yes, that is pointless, as any Usenet veteran (and most informed
newbies) could tell you.

You didn't exactly present an exciting new observation, you know.

Not at all. Scott, for example, is not new here, and clearly isn't a
troll. He got flamed for saying something that most others considered
stupid.

And when you look at the history of this newsgroup, that's almost
always the case. Newbies aren't automatically flamed, idiots are.

I don't admire a great many of the flamers here, actually.

>What a nice clique you seem to have here.

So, you're trying to categorize people into some arbitrary camps?
Sorry, despite many attempts, that just doesn't fly.
