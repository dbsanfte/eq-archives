Hmm, Im only buyin a new base unit so one monitor - I guess I could hook
them up and set one huge filespace to shared then move the monitor but I
was hoping to just move a few. There is going to be so much re downloading
and so on when I put the new machine that EQ patching on 600k cable isnt
going to bother me too much so I thought if a few files then I'd be OK.
