Because everyone has to get through level 30 to get to level 60.  Because
only a small percentage of upper level players are level 60, but 100% of
upper level players have gotten past level 30.

Because by level 60 you've learned pretty nearly every possible strategy,
90%+ of them were learned before level 30.  How low is that percentage going
to go when "The Vision" shifts from the stated "our goal is to have the
average player take one year to go from level 1 to level 50" (paraphrased,
but probably pretty close) to the unstated "our goal is for the average
player to get from level 1 to level 30 in one month, and then a few more
months for level 50?"

But yeah, I agree that some AAXP is Monty Haulish so some extent, but only
affects a small percentage of players.  I think that a GLOBAL change bears
more comment than specific little-used (when looking at all the customers,
not just the type you associate with now) changes.
