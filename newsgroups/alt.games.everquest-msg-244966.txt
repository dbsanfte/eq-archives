Lorianne got her cobalt from that, and arguably that allowed me to
efficiently tank high enough to start grouping regularly with people,
which allowed me to network enough to find a guild, which allowed me
to get to 65 and start raiding, which allowed me to begin to amass
equipment for a new main, which allowed me to get Taralynn to 65
without too much time investment, which allowed me to play a main I
actually am having fun with all the way to being elementally flagged.

So yeah I remember, and by that standard, owe everywhere I've been and
everything I've gotten on Test server to Age of Discovery and those
aqua goblins. :-)
