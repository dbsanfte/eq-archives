It *is* part of the installed game, but any part of the interface it 
doesn't find or which doesn't match the checksum of the latest version of 
that file will be downloaded, so you only need the initial patch program, a 
single file called 'Everquest.exe', as far as I know. This is only about 
1MB so someone could email you it if it didn't get installed. Chances are 
you already have it if you got 2 discs through a 3 disc installation 
though.

You might have to open up advanced options in the patch program and check 
all the checkboxes for the expansions, and do a complete file check, in 
order to download *everything*.

If you want to use the UBIsoft login server you can download the UBI 
patcher from their website at

ftp://ftp.ubisoft.com/eqloft/download/EverQuestUniversal.zip

this will get you a complete installation, but it'll log in through the 
European login server instead of Sony's US one. It can be handy to have 
both around anyway as seperate installations for when Sony's login server 
goes tits up and you can't get in even though all the world servers are 
working.
