Honestly, I think you'd enjoy either, but if you're a traveller like me,
you'll find it easier with Human.  Also, I haven't seen anyone else mention
this - but Humans level quite a bit faster than Iksar.  Also, try and take a
character to over level 30, the game is very different then (that's also
when the good money starts to come in!)
