Pretty much the same experience here.  There are several places that say 
that the items drop off the DE magicians but I find that they drop off 
_any_ Magician in the place.

Be _very_ careful of the Widowmistress.  She chewed through a buffed 
earth peet and then me before I was even able to con her.  I was in my 
30s as I recall.

Also, while you're in there a portion of your epic is done in there. 
There's a male DE magician, whose name escapes me, that wants 4 pages(?) 
from various mobs in there.  You can kill two birds with one stone.
