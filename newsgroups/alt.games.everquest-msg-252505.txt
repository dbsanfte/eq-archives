Acrylia Caverns will yield a few K in a few hours (discounting 
named drops).

Acrylia ore sold on Lanys for 30-40pp a shot.  The grimy weapons
sell to vendors for 100+pp (exact numbers escape me).  I used to
just clear my inventory of all but one normal bag, summon 7 Xev
bags and load up.  Between cash drops (stackable runes, weapons),
blocks, and stackable small pieces of acrylia (though not black
acrylia - they don't sell)) I would clear 4k ish in a few hours.

If the Primalist and Ritualist were cooperating I cleared quite
a few more K for their drops.

You might also check the prices on trade-skill supplies and 
consider annihilating spiders for silks.  They pile up fast in
EK if you kill everything you come across to force spider spawns.

Cash farming sucks, but you are one of the best classes to do
it.
