Honestly, as much as I detest the practice, I dont think they CAN stop
it and still have a viable player economy which IS part of the Vision.


I read yesterday (message is history) one person who stated that
because they havent stopped the mechanics that allow twinking, that it
proves that it is indeed PART of Verants "Vision".  I disagree.
Verant's Vision was a healthy player economy where everything that is
obtained is not simply purchased from vendors or looted.  The
mechanics that allow this part of the Vision are what makes Twinking
possible,  the simple act of trading.

This arguement is so pathetic.  And so worn.  While I dont disagree
that MOST of the people out there do twink or will be twinkers to some
degree and that there are indeed many who are envious of what someone
else has, the fact is that not everyone who is against twinking feels
that way because they have equipment envy.  I have the means to twink
well my Cleric but dont because I dont agree with it and find it to
cheapen the game, at least for me.

I think that a lot of it comes down to the nature of the farm so to
speak.  On a low level scale, is there anything wrong with me sitting
in the Gorge of King Xxorb doing the Lords for their gems and cash and
PBB's?  Not at all.  There is noone in that zone probably 90% of the
time. 

Now is there anything wrong with it if there is a person or persons
who want the camp and are of a level that could get experience for it?
IMO yes.  Farming items is not a bad thing if it is not done at the
expense of others.
