You can play with just original EQ, the expansions added continents,
playable races and a new class.

That being said, you should be able to find a variant of EQ with 
just about all the expansions.  

The various expansions provide content for everyone from the hard
core Uber guilds (who are in the end game of the Planes of Power)
to the new player, just starting out (the ability to make an Iksar
or Vah Shir and to make a Beastlord are all expansion capabilities).

Look for one of the packages that includes most of the expansions
in one set.  I know you can get on that has everything but Planes
of Power and Legacy of Ykesha.  If you can find one the includes
PoP, get it, as the Plane of Knowledge makes getting around the
huge world of Norrath MUCH easier.

A telephone connection will be just fine as long as it's fairly stable.
Of much more importance than the speed of the connection is packet loss
and ping, and you can get decent numbers with a good ISP from a 56k 
modem.

Hmmmm - well.  There are several classes that solo well, including 
Beastlords, Necromancers and Druids (that is NOT an exhaustive list
:)  I've found that Vah Shir, Barbarians and Halflings have some of
the best starting areas.  (my opinion, very subjective you understand)
