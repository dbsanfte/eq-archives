 We've had good luck with one cleric per group. Basically one should try
out different strategies and see what works for them. The good thing
about EQ is that in most cases you don't have to do exactly what
everyone else is doing to be successful.

 We normally have enough clerics show up that we can have one per group.
If we don't have enough we'll create caster groups with Druid/Shaman as
healers. We normally wont assign a melee group with no cleric.

 Mod Rods are useful. Mod Rod 2s are uber. But yeah they normally make
those during the buffing stage. Through the actual fight they'll have
their pet and whatever nukes they use. I'm not a mage so I have no clue
about their spells.

>> Necros : spike clerics with mana if needed.

 Dragonsbane + Mana pump = Dead dragon. Useful for clerics as well I
suppose since Dragonsbane is a little limited. Although with Critical
Strikes our Wizards are nuking for more than DB used to do. (Critical
Strike on a Dragonsbane is enough to make a melee feel unneeded!)

>> Pets : generally v little poitn

 Maybe not. But it's fun to see them all die at the same time against
mobs like Hoshkar when that big proc hits them.
