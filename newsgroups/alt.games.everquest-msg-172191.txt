No, but often times, people do things like that.  Do you have a name for
your car?  My truck's name is Hildegard; while the manufacturer would call
it a Dodge Dakota.

Or, since we're talking about character classes, I'll use an example from
the nav.

I'm a Machinist's mate, commonly refered to as an "MM," but also as a
mechanic.  People in my general field (engineering) are sometimes called
snipes, which can be derogatory or freindly.  The Electronics Technicians
are often called "twidgits."  Other communities or rates have nicknames as
well.  Anyone in the aviation community is called an airdale (usualy
derisively if it's by a snipe).  Sonar Techs are refered to as bubble heads.
It's just the way things are.
