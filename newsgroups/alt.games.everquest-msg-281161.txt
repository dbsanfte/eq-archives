I purchased a new computer with a Radeon x850 XT Platinum Edition graphics 
card and have been playing everquest everyday just fine. Yesterday I go to 
login and I get the error message:

Error downloading Pather Files
Error:Could not download file.
Please rerun Everquest.exe to try again.

So I tried several more times and couldn't login. I then contacted SOE 
online tech chat and he told me that my card is not supported. I then told 
him that I have been playing with ATI video card  Radeon x850 XT PE for 5 
months and have never had a problem. He linked me to a page with a list off 
graphics cards that are supported and my card wasn't on the list. I told him 
again that I have been playing for 5 months with this card and he said that 
was good but it was not supported. I asked if there are drivers avialible to 
remedy this problem and he said he did not know of any at this time. The 
chat session then ended.

Does anyone know what I need to do to fix this? Is it because of new 
expansion that was just released?
