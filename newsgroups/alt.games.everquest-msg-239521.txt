Found it funny on the drinal server, found a bunch of folks selling them for
less then 1/2 the 15k + that they were selling them for. Kinda of an irony
that the twinked got tweaked over the nerf.  Just hope they don't decide to
nerf my "Steel hilted dagger", love the proc on this thing and my 57 Ranger
gets at least 1 proc per mob.  Have had as high as 7 procs now per mob for
625 dd for each proc.  Helps to have "Jolting blades" up.  I have had the
fortune of it going off as well right after the dd proc.
