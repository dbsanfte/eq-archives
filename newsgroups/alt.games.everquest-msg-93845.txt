Hey all, just a few quick questions:
I've seen references to "NToV Loot" (or lewt hehe) in dozens of posts here,
and I was wondering if it refers to Temple of Veeshan?
~If so, what does the N stand for?

With a 50th (2 yellow from 51) Ranger main, I don't know too much about the
"end game" as yet.
I've done a few Naggy raids and the odd stint in Chardok.  However, being in
Europe most Kael / Plane raids are at times I outght to be asleep :( (unless
they're on weekends).
Anyhoo, my other questions (to any other 50+ rangers out there)
Should I start soloing once I hit 51 (and if so, what and where?(I have all
the expansions, but Luclin is a little choppy even with all the
optimisations)).  Or can someone recommend a good partner for a mini group
(shammy or druid perhaps)?
Is Call of Flame worth questing for?

Cheers and TIA,
