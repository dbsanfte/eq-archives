While it's often pretty easy to "see" through a wall to the
"under the zone" or "beyond the zone" space by pressing your
"face" up against a sloped wall, or by sitting/standing while
pressed up against a wall, it is (thankfully) hard to actually
fall through the wall except for certain bugged spots.

However, for example, if you REALLY want to drop under the Field
of Bone, do what a friend has done multiple times -- get DMF
(other levitate would probably work as well) and start climbing
the little building/pyramids in the Kaesora ruins.  On some of them,
you can walk through the "upper stories" (which are just visual
and not actually solid), the drop down the hollow middle of the
"buildings" and drop under the zone.  Note, some of the buildings
let you drop through and down, others end you up at ground level,
surrounded by walls too high to get back out from.  Either way,
you'll need GM assistance to get back out.
