	First off, I've never said that I believe that other NATO members wouldn't
consider doing the things the USA "drags them into".  I'm sure that many
European leaders would have liked to have intervened in Usedtobeslavia.  I'm
even more sure they're glad we did it for them, since that way they don't have
to endure the messy process of trying to grow backbones and climb the
evolutionary ladder.

	As for why they are still members, why wouldn't they be, as long as the US
is willing to pick up the tab for Europe's defense?
