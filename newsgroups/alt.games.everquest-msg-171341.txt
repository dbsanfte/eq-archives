I have an account with a level 51 bard on Brell server and a mid 20's bard
on the nameless server that I want to get rid of.  The bard on Brell server
is pretty behind on equipment.  He has some decent stuff,  but nothing
outstanding.   The 20's bard on The Nameless has a lot of Singing Steel
armor and other stuff from a lvl 60 bard I had on the nameless.   I quit
playing about 10 months ago and this account was pretty much a mule account
for my stuff on the Nameless so I did not ever get the velious upgrade for
it.

I will sell it for a very reasonable price if anyone is interested,  please
email me at:
