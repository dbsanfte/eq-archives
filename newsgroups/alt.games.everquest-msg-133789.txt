It's what I refer to Levitation, Everlasting Breath and Remove Greater
Curse.  They suck to get, and in the case of Lev/EB, take up slots that
could've had MUCH more useful spells in Luclin.

I call them asshat spells in honor of the the ubiquitous centi aliens
(umbral toilers in ME, Shak Dathor in UP, Centi Dators in Akheva, the Tro
Jeg/Cral Ligi/etc types in scarlet/twilight, the ones in the Shadeweaver
caves), and the fact that whoever came up with Lev/EB had their head up
their ass.
