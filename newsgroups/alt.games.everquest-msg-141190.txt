You got that right.  It will probably change  by the time I'm 57 or so.  At the
moment I'm;m focusing on getting some of those ellusive drop spells and
amassing a fortune which I seem to fritter away twinking a number of alts.

It took me long enough to build CoV faction, I'd like to enjoy it a bit longer
before I have to hit the Arena again.
