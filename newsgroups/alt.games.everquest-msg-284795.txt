Memory required to run Windows XP - 128 MB
Graphics memory required to run anything at all - 64 MB (note your 
integrated graphics is NOT a graphics card, so has no memory of its own)
Internal memory required to run EQ with EVERYTHING switched off - so old 
models, no sound, low resolution, all bells and whistles - 256 MB these 
days, if you have bought all expansions

Therefore absolute minimum memory required, and expect bad lag because 
you are going to be paging constantly, 450MB - call it 512MB.

Memory required to run Windows XP comfortably (ie without memory 
paging) - 256 MB
Graphics memory required to run EQ well in a shared memory situation - 
256 MB
Internal memory required to run one session of EQ with reasonably decent 
settings - 512 MB

Minimum memory required for a "good" EQ experience on your machine - 1 
GB

If you want to be able to be running other apps in the background, or a 
second EQ session with both having decent settings, you need 2GB memory.

Note if you are comparing with your desktop PCs, the odds are that they 
have at least 512MB of main memory each and dedicated graphics cards 
with at least 128MB of memory each, unless they're quite old ... in 
other words, they are at least 3 times as capable of processing a 
graphics based program as your laptop at present ...
