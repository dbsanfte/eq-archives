You bring out a good point.  Something I have thought for a while now is
that there should be more individual recognition by NPCs to the PCs.  A
simple example is a vender you normaly buy food from aksing if you want your
usual etc..  If soloing is realy going to be interesting enough to make it
worth while there must be more  than just faction but making friends with an
npc or enimies with another one not just a whole group of them.  Even
perhaps asking an NPC if they have seen another PC lately and getting an
answer or even a message.  Obviously the programming implications of this
are enormas but im sure they could find a way to make soloing better.
Adding these dimensions to a game could make possible someone eventualy
becomming king or something like that or having a king summon you for some
special duty or on and on and on
But unitll they solve the problem of modeling human behavior which gets into
the whole subject of AI soloing may be a bit of a drag.  Untill then i guess
we will have to settle for the old standby of real human interaction in
groups and guilds and suffer the imperfections of our fellow players.
