After playing a Monk for 53 levels, I can honestly say that I can
count the number of times I trained my own group on 1 hand. The same
goes for training other people/groups. 

FD is more than just a "Get out of Death Free Card". It is a skill.
and it takes time and practice to master. It requires a fair bit of
concentration, and knowledge of the area you are pulling. (Mob
pathing, respawn rates, argo radius, etc)

The Monks you see training their groups (and other people) tend to be
PL'd alts (or ebayers) that didn't spend the time at lower levels
learning the skill.
