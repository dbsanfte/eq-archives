    Your first post was a rant against those who tell the bard to "STFU and
play manasong", and others like him. I've tried to show you that sometimes
the group knows better than the player that's been added what the group
needs, you've ignored it. I've tried to show you that, while the group
leader is assuming he knows one class better than a person that plays that
class, the person that's new assumes he knows FIVE classes (the people he's
just joined) better than they know themselves. You've ignored it.

    They're the same damn thing, you moron. You're telling five separate
people "you don't need manasong, what you REALLY need is a seven point
damage shield twisted with 20 ATK, some haste, and regen!" You have no
freaking clue if they've been killing things quickly with melee, or pet
damage with nukes because the tanks have gimp weapons, or if they've been
getting owned every fight because the warrior is a prom queen and the cleric
has no mana regen toys. The group already knows these things!

    It's hard to figure out which you're talking about when all you tell me
is they told the bard to STFU and play manasong.

    Look above. The group leader knows something the new member can never
know: how the group is already functioning. It's very much a "DUH"
observation, but I guess it needs to be pounded home here.

    Because I see this sort of stupidity all the time when I group outside
the guild (which is thankfully rarer and rarer - /hug PoP XP zones). Group
of six, doing fine, one important person who is filling role X leaves. We
get someone capable of role X (usually by asking for "class that can do X"),
and they don't do it. When asked to do it, even in the face of terrible
group performance, they insist that what they really should do is Y. Perhaps
if these people did X to start with, and then suggested trying Y, it would
go over a lot smoother with the group and they'd actually have a basis of
comparison between what five people want and what one person wants.
