Ah, did not know what spells druids got for LoY.  As far as stoicism, 
it's not like the paladin is doing melee damage, he's there to keep agro 
after all, and stuns plus flash of light should do that just fine.  Also, 
stoicism only lasts 4 ticks, and heals 640 for 180 mana.  And other 
heals, namely Greater Heal until level 51 can be cast while Stoicism is 
still going.

Yes, I am mostly joking about the melee damage, with some of the newer 
weapons available, damage output is no longer quite the joke it used to 
be.
