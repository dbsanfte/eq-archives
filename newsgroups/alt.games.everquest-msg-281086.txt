Uh... yeah...

Lol... nope I'm afraid you came off defending SOE just enough that I 
thought you really beleived that low levels had gotten something 
worthwhile with each expansion instead of being baited with some minor 
feature that would make their life better -- often hyped into being much 
more useful than it actually was... (tribute, the task system, the charm 
slot.), or worse would be left seriously behind if they didn't have it 
(pok for example...or the DoN lobby)  

More importantly, a great many high level players do think its "enough 
content" to justify the price to lowbies.

That comment can swing both ways.

Better analagy maybe but not quite the same visual. :) 

Then again, maybe not... I wouldn't wish a $500.00 PC on even a soccer 
mom. Sure you don't need a GeForce 7000 series... but a memory starved 
celeron on a budget PC hobbled by Norton Monstrousity and 20 other tray 
dragging it to a crawl in order to give you "fast" (ironic isn't it) 
access to rarely used features like changing your colour depth.
