I meant NBG in the sense that only those who *could* use it would have 
the option of looting it. Anyone could make a case for any stat augs, but 
most melees, for example, would have no interest in a WIS aug. That's not 
to say that they should never get them. What if they are working on 
tradeskills? I guess it boils down to exactly how you're defining NBG. 
Different people seem to have different ideas.
