This is nice.  I still think loy wasn't a real expansion.  I hardly ever
see anyone there when I go, and people don't xp there, they just go for
the quests or charms.  They should have just given out the tools, I'm a
bit ticked off about it, also I didn't want to get it but I accidentally
clicked on the "buy now" and bought it by accident.

That's good, I always had a problem playing an ogre or a troll, they
wouldn't even get a skill up before they leveled.

Hope this isn't like the stupid can't kill red bug, er I mean
"protection" they put in.  I cast a dot on a red with my newb necro the
other day, and he came in then I tried to attack, the stupid protection
window came up and it took me awhile to click it off, even though the
mob was already beating on me.

!@#$!@%!$#%   God damit!  Another enchanter nerf!  I won't be able to
cast this on my pet or animation any more.  It was also nice not having
to be grouped to cast it when PLing.  Bastards.
