That's still dumb design.  Since there is no way to un-buy an expansion, all
they need to do to enforce the expansion restrictions is check when you
ding.  E.g., when you reach the end of level 50, check to see if you are
allowed to go past.  When you try to change your AA setting, check to see if
you have the appropriate expansions.  When you try to spend an AA point,
check to see if you have the appropriate expansion.
