Find out from other bards what the "default" faction is for them when
they finish their epic, then ensure you know what faction the charmed
mobs are to your KOS friend. Portions of the now broken wizzy epic can
now be done while invis, because that gives you indifferent faction.
Other classes epics, IIRC, require much better faction. Shammy for one,
I think.
