Kithicor.....2 routes, EK, HHP and into kithicor, or the slightly less
dangerous (ie more zone lines but close together) EK, Gorge, Runnyeye,
Misty, Rivervale, Kith. I'd wait till you have camoflague before yo try
the longer route though. I just hate the EK ramp.....and you can bind up
at Rivervale as well meaning a unlucky death in Kith aint an issue, plus
you can bank etc on the way.
