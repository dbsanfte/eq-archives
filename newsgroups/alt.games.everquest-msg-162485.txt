 Perhaps his guild killed Aerin'Dar themselves. At least that's how my
guild got in there. 

 Then again, he does say 'a few of its members' got flagged. It takes
more than 'a few' to kill Aerin'Dar.

 Well it is a second-tier encounter after all giving access to a
third-tier plane. It's not supposed to be like Sebilis to get into. Get
used to it. A lot of PoP is geared for the high-end raiding guilds.

 Seems tested to me. The initial drop rates were rather high but they've
been adjusted. Although if you sit there a long time (8+ hours) you're
bound to get a few of each. Perhaps that may still be a bit high.

 And this is bad how? Seems to me it gives people who aren't able to get
into higher-tier zones the opportunity to get those spells.

 Get in a guild and become a member of the 'haves' then if you don't
like being part of the 'have nots'. EQ isn't exactly based on the
welfare system.

 Nothing to nerf. XP in HoH is about the same, maybe even a little less,
than what you'd get in Plane of Valor. The only difference being PoV is
a lot more crowded.
