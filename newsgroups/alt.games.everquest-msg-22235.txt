Last night in Warsiliks, a small Giant group is going. 1 Druid, 1
Cleric, 1 Warrior. Doing well, we decide to let the Druid pull mostly,
because of the ability to single pull and scout out new mobs. 
I have just aggroed a high blue and give an incoming message. I pull
it to the wall, start to the pull point, and I see between me and the
group, a wanderer, yellow to me. I have a choice, pull them both to
the group and hope, or take it like a puller and eat the losses.

/g Crap! we have a potential add in the way. Do not try to save me, I
am going to solo this one in the corner and hope for the best!

I lived, barely. I was able to sneak around the wanderer, and the
group wanted to pull it anyways. I snared and Dot'd, then backed off
OOM and VERY low on health. They took it, but we were all in the same
boat when it was over. My message as it got close and I heard the
cleric OOM:
"<tank's name> when you get below 2 bubbles of health, call evac.
Every man for himself, SoW is still good on all."
