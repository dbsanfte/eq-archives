If the GM made this claim, the GM is probably confused. First of all,
when you "upload content" (such as a guild name), you "hereby grant to
us a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, sublicenseable
(through multiple tiers) right to exercise all intellectual property
rights", which means they can do whatever they damn well feel like
with the name. Second, in order to assert any property rights, he'd
have to prove he came up with the name on his own, and even if he did,
I suspect trying to assert copyright on just a guild name would be
doomed to fail (trademarks are another matter, of course). But I am
not a lawyer, so I may be wrong.

As to ryouseika's question, I have no idea what the policy is, but
there is nothing in the official guild policy page
(http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/customer_service/cs_guilds.jsp)
that suggests to me any form of special rights accorded to the
original guild leader. Nor should there be, as a guild is not
something that belongs to a single person, it takes 10 people to
create a guild and just because one of them has to be leader that
person shouldn't own the guild in perpetuity even if he/she/it steps
down.

Not that the GMs are likely to care about my opinion.
