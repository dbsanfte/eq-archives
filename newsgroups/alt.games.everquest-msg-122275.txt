If you wanted to do this, it would probably work out better to go to legends
and change the name for free, and while youre there farm some overcamped
camps (ac comes to mind). Rever back after and I would imagine you get to
keep your new name. It would just be extra work for them to change it back
so I dont think they would bother.
