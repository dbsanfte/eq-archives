But........what do you do after lvl 60? The thing I like that DAOC put
in was Dark falls. Your realm can only enter that if you own more
keeps or outposts than the other 2 realms.......
I can see why you went back to EQ, It seemed more "exciting"
somehow.....I've been gone for over a year, any big changes? somebody
did tell me that you don't get the silly "spellbook" that was in your
face for the 1st 35 lvls.......
