kiting of red mobs was never efficient . Yes a  druid at level 30 could kill
a hg but it took 30 mins and had a fairly high incidence of zoning to avoid
or outright dying . Net result an average of 20 plat and a tick of
experience . In the same amount of time he could kill 5 aviak harriers net
result an average of 30pp and 4 ticks of experience . Or he could get in a
good well balanced group somewhere with lots of blue mobs and gain a net
result of 50pp and 10 ticks of experience.

Also there are many people with the mistaken belief that druids are
powerfull . I have 3 main characters a 60 enchanter , a 55 druid , and a 51
monk . I have a part intrest in a 60 cleric . I played my 3 main characters
up and powerleveled the cleric up . Of the 4 my druid is by far the weakest
taken overall . The druid is also by far the hardest to level up . Most
people see a multitude of abilities and think powerfull but in actual fact
one  really good strong unique ability is better than so so abilities in
many areas. This is the reason that the semis (pally,sk,ranger) have such a
hard time . This is the reason the druid and necro have a hard time . This
is also the reason monks and bards have a hard time even though they are
best at something it just isnt a real important best.
