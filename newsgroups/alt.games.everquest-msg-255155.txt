The shrooms can spawn them too, at least at some places. And there
have been some on track that were not along that path at all; quite
possibly they were replacing mobs in the emp area.

It shouldn't take 8 hours. Not even for six drops. I can only guess
you pissed off the EQ RNG.

Unfortunately Chardok is the least fun of them. You need to either be
in the royals area (which requires a lock being picked or bypassed) or
the kennels, which can only support two groups and that only because
the respawn time there is so very very fast.

On the other hand there are probably a lot of harla dar cloaks already
out there. That's Phara Dar's quest; for elemental or even time melee
the ring reward is quite sweet. Less so for casters unless he did
change the effect after all.
