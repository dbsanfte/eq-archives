The "world" that you live, play, fight, and die in when you play
Everquest resides on Verant's servers in California.  You're paying
for the upkeep and bandwidth costs of these servers, which is
immense and a real bargain at $10/month.  For the mere cost of two
greasy take-out hamburger meals, you can play ALL MONTH LONG as long
as you like.  That's cheap entertainment.

And the reason that the servers need to be centralized at Verant
instead of letting every player spawn their own server (a la Quake)
is that when you enter an Everquest world/server, you're playing
alongside about TWO THOUSAND (on average) other people simultaneously --
for that kind of player population to exist, extremely heavy-duty
CPU and bandwidth equipment must be used; no non-corporate player
could possibly support that sort of game load.

And unlike most other multi-player online games, the Everquest world
isn't just made up of people you see for a day and then never see
again, among the few thousand players who "live" on whichever
Everquest server you decide to play on, you'll make friends who
you'll keep running into "around town" for MONTHS or YEARS -- it's
a real community.
