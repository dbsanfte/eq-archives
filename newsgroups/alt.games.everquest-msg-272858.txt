Hi gang!

I'm having a problem whenever I go into seller mode in my room. 
Approximately one hour after I go into seller mode, and if i have no other 
activity, the game automatically kicks me to the character screen, or I get 
the "lost connection" screen.  I'm using DSL so my line isn't hanging up.

Does anyone know if they have an inactivity timer to keep people from going 
into seller mode for days on end like in eq1?

This is happening to my friends also, and it doesn't seem to be a 
coincidence.

I've sent several bug reports.

Thanks!
