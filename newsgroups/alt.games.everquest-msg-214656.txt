60% not 50%.actually.

But you are quite right. I'm not debating that light players shouldn't 
have applied to heavy raid guilds, nor am I suggesting that raid guilds 
go out of their way looking for light attendance players to screw them 
on loot.

But the reality many of these attendance guilds end up with members who 
consistently fail to meet attendance requirements. And its not hard to 
figure out how it happens. RealLife happens. A love interest is met, a 
baby is born, a hobby/sport is joined, an alt is created, a PS2 is 
purchased,  etc etc etc. Finding other interests that take up a night or 
two a week is not hard to do.

At that stage something should be done; but most of these guilds just 
let them slide while denying them eligibility for any loot, which is 
unfair. Better to cut the member loose so he's not wasting his time, or 
modify the policy so that old-friends-who-got-a-life aren't shafted.
