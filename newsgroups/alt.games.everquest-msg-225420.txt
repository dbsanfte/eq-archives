BoT and Takish Hiz.  I don't have enough data to talk about what my
cha may or may not do for charming - so far all my charming is grouped
with people who give me a hand, and I don't keep the pet longer than
it takes to kill the named or boss mob.  I try very hard to get my pet
to eat the enrage, so he's low health when we turn to kill him.

Eindride Icewind took a charm pet from FH to 20% during enrage,
making the ex-pet a very easy to kill.  

I haven't been doing a lot of xp camping in BoT recently (my kitty
is only 55 so we do PoV at the moment so he can join us).  The day I
did we were on wind side, and pets can't follow through the portals
there - which rules out Charm or DC (for our 'chanter).  It did give
me obvious times to pet canni though - I'd suspend before going
through the portal, then eat a few pets on the other side before bringing
my pet back.  Also, when the named popped I just suspended my pet
and grabbed an elemental.  With BOV on him he's an utter monster.

Against Auliffe Chaoswind one of the warriors parsed my hasted charm
pet at 493dps, plus over 100dps from my nukes.
