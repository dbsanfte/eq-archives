Out of interest how much is the chanter adding to this duo ?
OK so there is mana regen after 16th.
And I guess (I have not checked) that Ench DD is better.
And I surpose that that there is always the added safty of mes / stun /
back up root etc.

But can't the druid just solo root / dot ?
Is Enc / Dru much better for the Druid ?

Jim
I guess that the same goes for the Necro too.
