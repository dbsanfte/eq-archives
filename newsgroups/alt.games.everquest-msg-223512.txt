I recently returned to EQ after a 7-month absence to play SWG. When I left
EQ my Barb Shaman was 42 (this was prior to the release of LDoN). Thanks to
the astonishingly fast pace of experience flowing out of LDoN adventures (is
it because of a generous XEM or is just the palpable pressure of a
time-specific goal that diverts attention away from the experience bar?), I
zoomed up to 51 and have started building out my character's AA strategy.
Accordingly, i've spent most of my time from 40's to 50's in LoDN adventures
and have never once visited the Planes that at one time looked sooooo
distant ...

Well, last night I peeked my head into PoT for the first time and
(cautiously) explored the entrances to Nightmare, Disease and Justice. I had
no idea of what dangers I might be walking into so I kept my finger close to
my Gate gem. Exciting! I found a couple of other wanderers and we teamed up
to kill festering rats and prisoners in PoJ (oh no, I'm killing rats all
over again)? Still, it was exciting mostly because it was just new and scary
as hell. Reminded me of the first time I walked into the house in Unrest...

I've looked (briefly) on Allakhazam and I see the usual account of
individual quests, but what I'm really looking for is a newcomer's guide to
how to approach the Planes. Is there some primary source somewhere that
anyone can point me to where I can read of the sort of general progression
that players make from one zone to the next? I've heard discussions of
"getting flagged" for zones, and I assume that this is some reference to
events which unlock the various portals to the next higher Planes via
"keys", etc. I know this is far in my future, but I'd like to start
researching this now so that I can get a good overview of how it all works.

I am not guilded so I don't yet have that resource to rely on. I understand
that becoming part of a guild is going to be a key component to my future
success so I'm evaluating various possibilities now. I've been invited to
join three different guilds recently and I keep putting each of them off
because I really don't want to make the mistake of joining one and having to
leave if it doesn't work out, so I'm trying to get to know these people
first.

Meanwhile, can anyone point me to a good reference source or guide to Planar
activities/strategies/progression, etc.?

Thanks,
