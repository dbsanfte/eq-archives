I'll admit that this does make a difference compared to the games I
mentioned. And maybe it's that important. I don't think so (see
below).

Of course few people used it, if there is an option to use a third
person view that works well and that can save you from getting killed,
of course most people will use it.

I haven't played on the PvP servers in Everquest much, but when I did,
I spent most of my time in first person view, only using third person
view while resting. And of the people I know who play seriously on the
PvP servers, most of them seem to play in first person most of the
time. And they're pretty hardcore players, in Defiant on Vallon
Zek. Admittedly PvP in Everquest hasn't exactly been a smashing
success.

I'd still probably try Shadowbane out if they hadn't screwed it up so
Europeans can't play, but I can't so I won't.
