I've also downloaded and installed ver 9.
If anything, I think it's a tad quicker.  Haven't had any probs with it.

This question is from Lenny.  I'm looking at him like he's
speaking Martain, and he's starting to get snippy with me.

   Has anyone here downloaded Directx 9.0, and if so, are you
having any problems with it?

I don't have a clue why he cares about this.

Annie
