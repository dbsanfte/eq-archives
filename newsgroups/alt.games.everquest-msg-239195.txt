Did you say something, Sean Kennedy <x@n.n>?

>Heh - the only one I use on my BL is
>/g Attempting to slow %t
>/cast 6
>/cast 6
>/cast 6
>/cast 6

The only one I had on Celaeno was
/cast 4
/g Renewing %t in 10 seconds
/cast 4
Spell slot 4 would be Tunare's Renewal or Karana's Renewal. I'd
interchange them according to tank's hps and my mana, and had more
than enough other things to put on my hotkey panels. /g was
interchangable with /rsay and channel numbers as appropriate.

The only one I had on my little tanks was "/g Incoming %t" :)
