Well as I said before, I was able to run EQ and Kunark just fine using
those specs but with 96 MB RAM. :)

Anyway, I went ahead and purchased a new case and a 300W PSU (Pavilion
case prohibits user from adding new PSU) for $39, another 256 RAM chip
for $37, and the GF3 ti200 video card for $75. Not the greatest but
decent enough to run EQ and some of the expansions. If I have
additional cash, I could upgrade the mobo and the CPU to something
better but I'm trying to save up dough to build a better machine for
MY use. This old one is going to my brother. :)
