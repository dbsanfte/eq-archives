I believe that to be inacurrate.  I think most Bush-supporters and/or
Republicans just weren't vocal at all during all the hoopla
surrounding the days before the election.  We just knew who we were
voting for and why, then did it.  Didn't waste any time with pollsters
who call or want to talk, just do my civic duty/privilege and get on
with life.

I chatted about this with some friends and they agree.  All were Bush
supporters and all avoided pollsters, rallies, etc like the plague.

To say we're uninformed is foolish, to say it was just fundamentalists
and hicks is just plain wrong.  It seems to me that the leftists are
more vocal, but the right still votes.  And apparently there are still
more of us than them.
