Wow.  I wish I could believe you were kidding.  Really I do.
5cp is 1/2000th of 10pp, and even a L20 can easily squeeze
more than 10pp out of a KEI.  You're a very "special" person

No, it's not.  If he expects most players to come up with the "usual"
amount, whatever that may be on his server, while allowing those of
limited means the opportunity to gain the benefit of his buff for less,
there is nothing even slightly disingenuous about "donations".  5cp
or a stack of summoned water for a 900mana L60 buff is an insult,
your claim of "genuineness" is simply incredible.
