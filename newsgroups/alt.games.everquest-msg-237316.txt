As a BST, Wisdom is likely to be the better stat for you, and it works 
equally as well as Int for tradeskills.  For smithing in particular, STR 
can be used instead, so you should be set for smithing.  Basically, you 
may want to invest in cheap wisdom gear that you will use only for 
tradeskills, and get the best buffs Wisdom buff you can, and/or Strength 
for smithing.
