This should read...

If they can get past the trials, it's with one very small portion of the
actual guild.  Our guild was much closer to being "ready" than most.   Some
of our best outfitted groups leveled up to 65 and did, eventually, get past.

In other guilds of this type, you're likely not even have a full group of
60+, just one or two people.   Those one or two have the option of waiting
months for casual players to catch up, or "abandoning" thier guild for a
guild that can get them past.   And even if they do get past in a pickup
group, they are still likely to be seen as "abandoning thier guild"... just
in favor of tier 2 exp groups, instead of another guild.
