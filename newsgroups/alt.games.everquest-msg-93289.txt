Last week, I upgraded from a Voodoo3 2000. Stay away from the the MX line of
the GeForce4. It has less performace than the GeForce3 line and just
slightly better performance thant the GeForce2 line. I went with a GeForce3
Ti200 from S-R Systems (listed on Pricewatch) for $140 shipped. It's the
ABit Siluro card, and doesn't have the optional TV out connectors, but for
playing Luclin, it works fine.
