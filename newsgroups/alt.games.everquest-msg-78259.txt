I disagree that it's the "best" way, but it's an easy way if you don't want
to pick up an old Pentium 150 and slap a free *NIX on it (usually the BSDs
are better than Linux, but that's not something I'm in the mood to argue).
This is generally not the best method for most people.  8)

The problem with many switches is that:

- Some of them (particularly the inexpensive ones) cannot be configured
- Those that can may be difficult to confiugure
- Defualt settings aren't always very secure (i.e. configuration settings
available to everyone).
- There are a lot of well-known exploits/security issues with many of them.

You'll want to do a lot of reading/research into any switch you consider
buying, just as you would with any personal firewall software for your PC.
Find out what crashes, what's frequently exploited/broken, and then make a
decision based on what you think your needs are.

If I wanted total internet security, I'd buy a pair of scissors.
