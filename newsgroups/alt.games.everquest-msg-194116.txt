Tal and Sev are more than doable for you.

Don't think about Trak till you are dropping Gore.

They are the usual 32k Hp Kunark boss mobs... each has a different AE (e.g
gores is cold, tals is fire).  Gore slows, Traks is a big dot, Tals is also
a dot.  Trak has "trak touch" - a banish to the mushrooms.
