From my time on telnet chats, I remember the eastern European guys
that'd stop by from time to time. They didn't have your count dracula
accent in typing, but they had recurring typos and odd grammar that
would have let me identify their origins even if I hadn't had access
to their IP number/name :)

None of my current characters (2 wood elves, dark elf, gnome) have any
'typical' accents to lean towards - if I make a barbarian, she might
get a little of the auld highlander lilt :)
I do roleplay my speech patterns to a certain extent. My wood elves
are closest to normal me, getting into a more serious mode when
roleplaying by avoiding words like 'sure' and 'hello' for  'I would be
honored' and 'greetings' - that kind of thing. 
My dark elf is usually a very, very cold person and not prone to talk
like normal me other than with friends. She'll refer to other players
as barbarian, wood elf, gnome etc. in conversations to establish their
difference and inferiority, and curse anyone who offends the teir'dal
in the name of Innoruuk. Combat can bring out the red hot side of
hatred in her, but she'll never be an OWNZJ00! type even when angered,
more of a 'How dare you challenge my power? *HT* Die, you fool' type.
My gnome is a hippie treehugger. She'll hug people's knees, jump over
tables, dance around, say stuff like 'whee!' and generally talk a
little childlike and enawed by her surroundings.
