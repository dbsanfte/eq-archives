Gack.  That is very annoying if they did it again.  They shouldn't
ever have to renumber the servers, but I won't get into that.  If they
*DO* renumber the servers, they should also rename the files for you
the next time you start the EQ client.  The code to do this is
trivial, and would save a lot of users a lot of hassle.
