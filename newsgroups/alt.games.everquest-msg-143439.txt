I don't have hate for druids

I also disagree they should heal for 80% of what a cleric does

> 978 for 400 mana does not cut it when clerics heal 7k for 400.

just like clerics nukes and dots don't cut it for mana compared to a druid.
druids also have a lot of utility spells..  regen, DS, see invis, invis,
sow, ports, snare, ability to give others mana regen

Give clerics 80% of your spells, then maybe you should heal 80% of what a
cleric does.. cuz lets be honest here, high end clerics heal, and nothing
else

One of the new cleric spells going to druids instead would have been ok
maybe... giving druids celestial healing maybe.. giving them a 3-4k heal
tho?

You need your head examining if you don't think druids are an already
extremely powerful (overpowered) class.

 Hi, a guild druid SOLOD tantor.. no kei, no other help, and he fucking
solod a red con mob in WW with xxxx thousand HP
