Doh. Of course I ment snare. My bad. I wonder how long I've been using
the wrong word.


Here's my battle setup by the way (which I had unfortunately not
memmed):

One slot is always taken up by harvest,
one snare (the only one i got, still don't have the lvl 51 version)
one root (usually a real low level, short cast time, short duration)
one stun (longest lasting i have (6s?), double functions as
minni-nuke) - when soloing this is sometimes replaced with a self
invis if needed
one rune type spell (melee damage mitigation)
one big nuke (mana efficient, main nuke)
one hard to resist nuke, usually fire based, medium damage output/mana
efficiency
one evac (in group) or abscond (solo) spell
