I don't understand your implication that he had slightly _better_ chances
to win with a 0 99 unless you figured him for the hidden agenda of going
for a re-roll if and only if he rolled badly.

To take a case closer to the borderline, what would your response be
in the case of a fellow who rolls 99 on a 0 100 while you roll 90
on a 1 100.  Assume that the correctly called range was 1 100.  Do you
force him to re-roll?  Can you make him like it?
