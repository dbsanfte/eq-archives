Since I start suffering from carpal tunnel effects, I was looking for
ways to get away from the keyboard and to use soemthing more 'natural'
to hands. I noticed I get less problems with using a playstation
controller, so I looked forward to some programmable (in terms of
keystrokes) gamepad to use with EQ. Is anybody using this and could
give some reviews of recent gamepad controllers, that are comfortable
to hold and allow assigning keystrokes to the buttons on it (for
backstabbing etc). It doesn't have to be fully macro programmable, as
I'm not doing any tradeskills etc anyway.
