Actually, on my first trip to Lavastorm/Najena with my human necro, I
was shocked as anyone to find that I was dubious with the Nek guards.
Not sure if any other wandering dragoons, etc. are on a different
faction, but I seem to be ok with them. Human necro faction around the
world seems pretty consistent everywhere. It sucks, but it's not KOS in
most places. Dubious and apprehensive seem to be the norm. Elves
excepted, of course. I was KOS to the sisters as soon as I got there.
