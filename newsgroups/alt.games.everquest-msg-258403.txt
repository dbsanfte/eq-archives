As DT said, he was there to tell part of the storyline of the Velious
expansion.

You were warned that there would be dire conseqences should he awaken...
after freeing him, thats exactly what you were supposed to get.   All major
Velious mobs instantly respawned, doing zonewide shouts about death and
destruction, warning everyone to flee for thier lives.   The Sleeper would
then kill those that set him free and rampage across 5 zones, killing all of
the dragons who had imprisoned him.

After this one time event, the main room of Sleepers Tomb would be empty.
