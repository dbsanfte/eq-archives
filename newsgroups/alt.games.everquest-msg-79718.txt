Maybe it's different in non-raiding guilds, but aren't rogues pretty much 
a requirement for almost any high-end encounter?  I know that well before 
we were doing anything tough, we alwasy had enough rogues that we could 
have one to unlock doors for us.  Hell, if account sharing weren't 
prohibited, we would probably have a shared rogue account that we could 
use, but that would be bad.
I also don't see how needing one rogue is such an issue.  The big issue 
for CoM reavers is usually having enough mages to cast firepets for 
whatever mob has that nasty FR AE.  (Not sure who needs this guy, we just 
seem to kill him every time we go to CoM.)

Why?  Nobody seems to exp there, at least not on Innoruuk.  I know I was 
bound there a bunch 45-52, and there were almost never more than 1 group 
exping there.  Maybe every 2 or 3 days there would be a raid there.  Not 
like Seb or Velks or KC or some of those zones.

Isn't the only hard part about VSR killing VS in the first place?  And 
aren't the fire giants one of the fun things about Ragefire?  At least 
they give exp.

Arolpin
excited that we have a CoM raid scheduled
