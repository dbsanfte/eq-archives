Oh, I quite agree. 

But then, if the method of theft involved eBay or similar sales of
accounts, which is the strong impression I had, then the victims
themselves were breaking the license agreement. If the theft resulted
from shared passwords, well, just as thieves deserve to get nailed, so
do stupid people.

I have trouble generating much sympathy for the victims in either of
those cases.

There are relatively few ways it might be done. I personally think it
highly unlikely that the accounts were truly hacked in any technical
meaning of the word.

No doubt his attention has been keenly directed.
