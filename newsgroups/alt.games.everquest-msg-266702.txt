   Sounds like a kick-ass episode of Judge Judy, to be sure.  But the facts
are, I don't want to be instrumental in causing someone else's death on
purpose.  My own moral compass tells me that poisoning someone is wrong,
plain and simple.  I used to be a professional cook.  I've had to take
quite a few food safety classes.  I know the chances of actually killing
someone this way are slim.  But I don't want do it.  So, let's just end
this little debate by agreeing that I'm simply a pussy on this issue, and
let it be at that.

   I don't think my stand on issue changes the possibility of my sending a
little negative reinforcement towards our thief's way.
