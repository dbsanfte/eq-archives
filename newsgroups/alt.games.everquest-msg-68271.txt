I did the third claws 14 times... succeded on
my first combine at 19 skill, and then failed
it 12 times as I leveled the skill up till
I finally made it at 31.

Funny thing is, I made a tailored backpack
in 4 tries while getting skill to 32, just blowing
thru my remaining HQ pelts for the fun of it.

Next step involves loot off hoppers in Hollowshade,
and thats one tough zone.  Just as a heads up, the
rhinobeetles backstab and aggro a -loooong- range.
