In other words, a total absurdity. What *should* be an identical product is
being made
incompatible. Why does the client need to be different at all? European
releases of EQ work
perfectly with US servers, whats so different about the new servers apart
from their location?

Stupid, stupid, stupid. I can't imagine a move designed to make European
players
currently using US servers LESS likely to transfer to local servers (which
makes good sense)
than this.

Stuff 'em. Until they come up with patches to make both PoP releases work
with both
servers AND implement free character transfers to "encourage" players to
move, I'll
be sticking to the US version and Saryn, thanyou.
