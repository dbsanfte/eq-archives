I posted in a seperate thread here somewhere that as a 56 mage with 
nothing particularly special, I was able to add about 110 mana per tic 
to whatever mana regen I already had going... but only while doing 
nothing but canni.

Realistically, normal use got me about 20 mana per tic when needed, and 
going flat out switching between canni and chain nuking and back to 
canni, no more than 55 mana per tic, because the canni process itself 
takes time, and nuking takes time, and you can do one or the other at 
any given moment.

The only time when I really got the 110 mana per tic benefit was 
immediately after a rez; click mod rod, make pet, chew pet, repeat until 
FM, took less time to get FM from rez than it did to get the rez effects 
to wear off.

There are AA and gear and better pets with levels that could 
theoretically boost that mana per tic up significantly, a number I've 
frequently heard quoted is 136 mana per tic.  However, this still comes 
only while actively doing pet canni, so I still doubt anyone really saw 
a 200 mana per tic rate over the course of an hour... perhaps if in duel 
mode and someone was mana tapping them so they could lose the mana 
without having to stop and nuke?

It is unquestionably a LOT of mana regen, and its possible some degree 
of nerf was in order, although I don't recall hearing anyone complain 
that mages were too powerful.  Lots of drawbacks to pet canni, and took 
a lot of effort to really make use of it well, plus mages tend to be 
aggro limited in terms of DPS anyway.

It won't have massive effect on my current play style, other than 
forcing me more than ever to find KEI before going on a run... and 
probably to be willing to leave an LDoN in order to get KEI replaced if 
it gets dispelled.  I generally used it for occaisional boosts or to 
substitute for lack of mana buffs; with just "sit on my butt" mana regen 
I can't really contribute much DPS at all, but with KEI I've usually not 
needed pet canni at all.
