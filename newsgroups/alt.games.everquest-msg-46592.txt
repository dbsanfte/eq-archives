    Improvement to what? He USED to feel he wasn't going to play to sixty -
he cared less about endgame raids. He liked to hang out with friends and
just have fun playing around. Now he gets tells non-stop to come here, go
there, and his guild pressures him to raid non-stop. He did 50 to 54 in a
week without PLing, just LFGing, and feels he HAS to go to 60, get epic, and
be on 24/7 to help his friends and guild. From my perspective, it sounds
like his enjoyment of the game just took a massive turn for the worse.

    From a class perspective, yeah, you're right. 8)
