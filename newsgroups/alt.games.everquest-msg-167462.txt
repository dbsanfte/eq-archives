Riiiight...and I play multiplayer FPS games because?
I'd agree with one part of that suggestion, it is simple.

The constant crap I saw in chat channels was enough to put me off of the
Zeks, the only time I have seen so many idiots (d00dz) in the same place
since was when I started a character on AB.
The concept of PvP I like, the (vocal) majority of player's attitudes I
don't and the lack of any real PvP class balance doesn't really help you
play what you want, more what will survive, this is why I stick to blue
servers.
