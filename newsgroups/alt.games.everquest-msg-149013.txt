I think I tried kiting a few times at that level and yes it's rough.  You
can twist selos  in or buy sow potions if you have a rich alt.

That's right.  Those songs are 1/3 as efficient because they dont last 3
ticks.  If you don't like cod you could twist 1 selos and 2 bruscos.  Save a
slot for cod though to use after it starts the death march.

No good info, but at your level it shouldn't matter either way.  CHA may or
may not have effect on mez and charm.  No way it affects cod.
