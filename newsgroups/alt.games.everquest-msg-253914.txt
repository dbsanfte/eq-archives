Also perhaps worthy of note, I did successfully get an Intimidate skill up 
during a duel.  So it clearly doesn't follow the rules for other melee 
skills...

I'm also pretty sure they fixed that bug with the interacting with other 
melee attacks.  I asked on monkly-business and they said so, so it must 
be! :)  It seems to work more or less like this:

-Click Intimidate
-You have a chance of a skill up at this point.
-A few seconds pass, during which you engage in amusing gymnastics.
It's also worth noting that you can change targets during this time.
-Then there is a check against something, and you have another chance of a 
skillup, and one of three or four outcomes:
  a) 'you're not scaring anyone' or 'you can't intimidate yourself!', if 
     you happened to end up with yourself as the target, or if your 
     original target died during the interim.  In the first case, you 
     failed the intimidation check.  In the second, I don't think it does 
     a skill check.
  b) Target out of range.  That means you -succeeded- but the mob wasn't 
     close enough to appreciate your efforts.  But you can get a skillup. :)
  c) Target has resisted your fear spell.  That means you succeeded, but 
     then it did an MR check, and you still suck. :)
  d) non-melee for XX damage, mob flees in terror.  Congratulations, you 
     did it. :) The non-melee does seem to imply that a kick is involved.

I have managed to get -two- skillups with one click of the button, one 
right after the click, and one when it actually failed to scare anyone.  
So it definitely checks the skill at least twice.  Which may explain why 
it's so unreliable.  But my 33 Monk, with skill just over 100ish, has 
managed to semi-consistently fearkite yellows and low reds with 
intimidate.  One success is usually enough to make it a very close battle, 
two successes during the same fight is the win.  Oh, note.  I also had 
Temp, and needed it, heheh.  Mend with temp is such a lovely thing. :)

(The test mobs were mostly the little burynai badger guys in Frontier 
Mountains.  They finally coughed up that quest item I needed, just before 
I dinged 33. :) )
