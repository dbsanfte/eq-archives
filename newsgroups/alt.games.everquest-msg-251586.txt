Keep in mind - if you have even one of the focus items from the
bag on you, the whole spell fails with a "can't have 2 lore item"
message.  PITA

When PoT9 was available, I always took it (the extra HP over some
useless AC and the 5 per tick regen).

For a conj. spec'd mage BS is more efficient.  The old problems (LOS
issues) is vastly improved now (I hear on the Tower) so it can be your
bread and butter nuke if you want.

2 second cast time.  Very nice for getting a nuke in on a runner, getting
a nuke in on trash mobs before the raid kills it.  Also, it does the
same chain cast DPS as Sun Vortex but generates less aggro.  This comes
at the cost of efficiency.

Very useful if you two-box a non-gating class, otherwise..... eh.

DS's now last 15 minutes - making them very mana efficient damage in
fast pull groups, even when mobs are slowed early (48pts, I used to
see our tank take 20-25 hits, so around 1k+ per mob extra.  In a good
group that's 8k-10k damage from a single cast)

Rak Ashir.  That doesn't work anymore.  Best way to kill rak is straight
up tanking these days (for quite some time).

Most handy if you get Call of the Archmage - that way you have a fast
cast way to lock your charmed monster down then recharm.

I never moved up - way more mana for a very small percentage increase
in debuffing.  Despite what one mage tried to tell me, it doesn't have
any negative resist modifier to help it land.

Son of Rathe is now a *very* nice solo pet.  His mitigation is better
than air.  You *really* want the LDoN focus for these - the extra HP
and mitigation are incredible.  Also, all pets focused by DPoC and up
come with summoned plate on them, thus reducing set up time.

Sun Vortex was the staple fire nuke before the LoS problems were improved,
now it may not be so important.

CoTAM is just plain fun.  BOV and FA and a couple other buffs and he was
clocked at 500+ DPS on the Air tower boss.  Nice thing there is that there
is plenty of room to see charm break - mez and recharm.

You'll start getting 54 per win at 65 in a group avg 63+
