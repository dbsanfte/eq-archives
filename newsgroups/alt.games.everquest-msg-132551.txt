If there is no competition for SK gear then they should go for cheap.  The
only way that SK gets his piece for 1 point is if no other SK wants it.
What is unfair about free market?  If I am the only bard there I should get
that bard only gear for no points.  It does seem fair to me and from what
I've seen it works.  Besides, how are you possibly going to maintain a list
of all possible drops AND make sure each item's point value is up to date?
Value changes almost daily.
