I use my pet when i play my SK (34th lvl)  for several reasons.

1. It can sometimes hold aggro when I need to make a run for it.
2. Even the extra 5 damage per tick is better than none. It does add upp.
3. The skeleton pet looks cool and keeps me company when i travel alone.

But, like another SK said "if you dont use the SK pet, then you arent
playing the SK class to its full potential". Now that sounds like words of
wisdom. I often say that to other SKs, but most say "no he is too weak", but
my hunting partner has a 65 SK, and i often tell him to summon a pet and he
does. I think skele pets are part of the roleplaying aspect of the SK class,
so i recommend all SKs to use their pets. I know, some people cant handle
pets and the pets only get killed after 5 mins. But if they never try, they
will never succeed.

I think SOE should give the SK pet a weak but very useful proc ability or
something like the wizard familiar buff, so that we see more SKs using their
pets.

BUT! Just remember the most important of all..."When my skele laughs, I
laugh and then we all laugh. We are evil. Muhaha." :-)
