My troll had over 200 stamina, and i could not see any difference in my 
attack speed when i was out of stamina. Usually grouped with a RL shammy 
friend, so we tried a little with and without invigor. No difference at all.

If you wanna have a little to laugh about, try to download copelands 
weapon analyzer (yes, dont work with 2h weapons any more untill he 
update it, a shame), and see when a Lammy start to do more dmg in main 
than a Wurmslayer.
Next time you meed a level 30 person that laugh at your Wurmy, tell him 
those stats, and laugh at him for having at Lammy at that time.
