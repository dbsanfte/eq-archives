SE is Supernal Elixer, a level 62 cleric spell in the "heal over time" (HOT)
line; it heals a total of 2000 hp a bit at a time for 28 seconds.  Extending
the duration while leaving the HP per tick the same would mean more HP for the
same mana cost, and would be a "good thing."

FT is Flowing Thought, an effect on certain items which increases your mana
regen while equipped.  Each point of FT is one point of mana per tick.
Considering that standing you naturally regenerate two mana per tick, FT is
quite an increase.  Considering that sitting you get close to 25 mana per tic,
and BAOR adds 6 more and KEI adds another... 12? and Spiritual Purity adds 7
more...well one more here or there really doens't matter as much as it might.
But FT 15 would still be a healthy chunk of added mana regen even under the
best circumstances.  Mental Clarity works just like FT, and in fact is subject
to the overall natural mana regen cieling of 15, so MC 1 and 14 FT hits the
maximum.
