Alternatively, the lowbie area just out from the OT PoK book is a
great place for a 16 - 22 Druid to solo for Defense skill-ups (and
some xp), works well for Shaman doing the same thing.  As a side
benefit she'll likely end up with a beak (or 10) that she's looted
from her own kills, it's always nice to do at least part of a quest
for yourself.  :)
