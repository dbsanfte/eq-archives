I can tell ya, and I dont even need to do it in a smartass way either

This logic fails when you factor in the fact people are WAY above the cap
anyway, pre-buffed

To get to Time you have to go via the elemental planes and gods as a
minimum, typically through vexthal and the like too.

Through that building and farming phase you pick up a lot of elemental gear.
Figure that the sleeves, hat and boots all give +20 INT, legs give +23 INT,
gloves give +18 INT.  This doesn't even factor in other slots, maybe an AHR
neck for 15 more INT.  Fennins earinging gives you another 25INT.  If you
happened to get a mask of conceptual energy, thats another 20INT.

The net result of this is a LOT of +INT.  Infact, more INT than you could
possibly use

We can safely assume they progressed through the tiers, we can safely assume
they have full elemental armour (at the very minimum, all minus bp/legs)

So that means we can safely assume they have a LOT of INT.

The cap is 355 (With AA's invested).  Lets say I have 430 INT. Thats not
unrealistic at this level of the game.
You know what happens when I get a loot item with 15 less INT?  Thats
right.. Im still past the cap. I lost nothing beneficial, and gained a lot
positively.
