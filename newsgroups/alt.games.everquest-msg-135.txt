The best way would be if, while you are an NPC attacking things not by
your choice, you neither get nor lose EXP, however, you can die and
loot. If you died twice, the were-effect wears off. During the blips
while you were still a PC, you should be able to gain / lose EXP as
normal. The tricky, and frustrating part, would be...When you are a PC
with were-effect on, you might be killing something, and then blip
over to NPC, thus, your were-effect KSed from you, just like guards
do. This would be fun! You'd get KSed, you run the risk of killing
your friends, but you would look very cool.
