Paladul caverns bandit camps are perpetually overcamped, but on most servers the
rest of the zone is very peaceful and happy killing spree.  Its not as though
the bandits are the only exp there, the zone itself has a 160 ZEM, so every mob
there yeilds more than twice what killing an identicle level mob would in a
normal zone (ZEM 75).  Try the Phlarg Fiends, or you are still good for some of
the bugs, fungus, and I've heard tell of bigger bugs and an owlbear camp but not
sure of the levels on those.  Oh, and there's some kind of fish swimming around
in the lake, might be good exp too.
