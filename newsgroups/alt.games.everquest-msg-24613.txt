    I prefer the "black helicopters" theory from EQTraders: VI wants to
reduce disk storage space. Tradeskillers were making pelt mules just to hold
all the damn things. Even without mules, I'm guessing the disk space
required to store a stack of eight pelts is less than the disk space
required to store eight individual pelts.

    I would HOPE the change was prompted by someone there doing the actual
tradeskills, though. I prefer changes to be motivated by a Verant employee's
experiences at the game, rather than responding to players' whines. This
change would indicate then indicate that a VI employee was a tradeskiller,
and that would lead to a steady stream of properly-motivated changes. Like a
use for the scaler. ;-)
