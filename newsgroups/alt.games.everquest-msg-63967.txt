  On this I can agree.  I don't know WHY Verant sucks so bad at informing
their customers and giving semi-accurate ETAs, but they really do suck at
it.  I don't care if they take 18 hours, 24 hours or 30 hours to get their
servers live.  That's the price we pay for "new stuff".  It takes however
long it takes.  But I really do dislike being "lied to"... being told the
game will be up at 11 am, and then finding out it's still down at 4 pm, with
no reliable word on the status.  If their ETAs were only off every once in a
while, that would be fine... but they are consistently wrong.  At very least
they can pad their estimates.  If they think something is going to take 6
hours, be generous and say the ETA is 6-9 hours.  Don't most good engineers
try to provide themselves with a little wiggle room?

  Well, whatever.  I have come to expect less than stellar customer service
from EQ, regardless of whatever else they do well or poorly.  I don't trust
their ETAs and I have come to expect that if something goes wrong, I'm more
likely to get prompt assistance from a fellow player in the same fix, than I
am from an paid staff member.  It sucks and many of their customers are very
critical of their customer service, but I doubt Verant is going to change
its ways until (and unless) a significant competitor in the MMORPG arena
shows itself... and even then, I doubt much will change.  Even if there is
another quality MMORPG, people will still play EQ because they have a lot
invested in the game... their character, their items, their achievements,
connections, friends, ect.  A lot of things keep a person tied to EQ, the
LEAST of which is Verant customer service.
