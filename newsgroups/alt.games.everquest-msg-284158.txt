Nice skit  :D  How did it go in PoK afterwards? Did throngs of adoring
players in PoK stream after you, singing peans of praise and strewing
your path with rose petals and laurel garlands, prior to *begging* you
to allow them to group with you?  Don't worry about the Ranger - the
group *must* have failed you in some way  :D  Let your bitching about
them commence!!
