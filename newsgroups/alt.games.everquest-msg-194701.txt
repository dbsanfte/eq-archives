Personally I've yet to see this happen, but then I don't yet have mass
healsong.  Thus far (thru 57) I've really found very few times when I've gotten
aggro off anything, of course in a raid situation I tend to turn off group and
mass songs on incoming (just as my cleric doesn't tend to CHeal on incoming
normally) so that aggro goes where its supposed to.  Incoming announcement is a
good time to start Amplification, I figure :)

On the other hand I've run quite an assortment of group songs and raidwide buff
songs and never been very high on the "you're next when I get thru with the MA"
list.  I've never even considered memming my hate reducing song, either, since
aggro hasn't been a problem at all.  Well its been a problem if I'm trying to
hate kite, since if my partners aren't careful they can easily steal hate from
me despite me running snare/slow and a couple DOTs on the victim; retaining
aggro can be a problem, not losing it!
