With Virtue,SV,Kragg and IoS my kitty runs ~6k hp.  Our cleric has
~220aa, FT13 or 14.  And I can offtank these guys.  (although it eats
mana.) 

Despite the fact that they hit harder, I've been told they do less
damage over the course of a battle (I've only been on a couple of
LDoN hards and don't pay attention to the healing) than LDoN hard
mobs.

The group last night was War, Wiz, Cler, BL, Mage (our druid friend
wasn't on).  I'd imagine a 65 paladin, even with only 6500 hp, would
tank much better than my cat (only 25aa, run3, innate metab1, sta2,
ND3, Paragon.  Working on pet hold then I'll start on CA/CS then 
LR/ID) 


The cleric was able to use CH a bit, but he generally eschews it
for the faster heals.  Since they have lower HP than their the PoP
mobs that do the same DPS, the key is DPS.

Also, the turtles are about the same xp, but don't double as often
as the other mobs - so finding a room full of them (apparently there
is one) might make it even easier.
