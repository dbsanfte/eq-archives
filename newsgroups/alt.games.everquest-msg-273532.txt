I've seen that before when I log in just as the server is going down.
(Actually, I just checked my logs; when it happened to me it was 71580
minutes. :-)  I assume it's due to some sort of bug when the shutdown
time has actually arrived but you haven't quite been kicked off yet,
and so the "time till shutdown" is negative.

Well, the answer to the last question is obvious: it was brought down
because there was an update recently.  Heck, they managed to leave it
up for nearly 24 hours before they had to take it down to patch it!

So, I wonder if giving stuff to an NPC will still leave me invisible
after it comes back up?
