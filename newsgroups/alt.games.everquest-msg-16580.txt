Last night was rangerfest in DL again; was in a group with 2 rangers.
Only other tank was a level 35 rogue, the rangers would both go
looking for a pull, enchanter would mez as needed and there was a
cleric for heals - and he was not as overworked as you'd expect.

Then again, we didn't pull any ravishing drolvargs.
