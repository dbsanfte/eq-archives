Heh. Come to think of it, you're right. Problem with implimenting more
of this type of quest is they're the most fun alone or with maybe 1
helper. If you get a big group, it's trivial. ;-p Make that rogue
break into a castle and steal something. Too many quests are either
just killing or running errands. It ends up being left to groups of
players to set up their own RP "quests"...
