Really, the starting stats aren't a big deal in the long run. Play
the race you want to play. One exception to this is that you want
AGI no less than 75 to avoid a significant armor class penalty.
Above that, AGI makes too little difference to AC to worry about.

The revamped Innothule Swamp is good from a cash standpoint. The newbie
area is full of spiderlings. Spiderling silk is consumed in large
quantities by blacksmiths for leather padding, and is the best cash
source for newbies by far. There are also zombies here; there is some 
market for zombie skins as a pottery component for poison vials.
