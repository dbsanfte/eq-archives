I've never used a SoD, but what I can say from my epics / Frostreaver axe
experience...

It all depends on the type of proc.

The proc on the warrior epic has a debuff component.  When it is resisted,
it generates *more* hate than when it is successful.

The proc on Frostreaver is DD and stun.  When it is resisted, it "seems" to
generate less hate.  Possibly equal, definitely not more.
