Well, in a sense, -all- the heals are backup heals, since you're just not 
healing the main tank, not using CH, and there is no constant stream of 
damage to count on.

Yeap, that's about what happens. 

}The one time I've done AOE group, this happened with some frequency.
}Not only during the killing, but in the "holding pattern" phase.  We had

}means that one mob in a 50 pull gets out from under every other stun
}cycle on average.  I was healing the chanters with fast heals till we were
}ready for nukage.

I think you've misinterpreted the data, assuming that's my 98% figure.  
98% was the maximum -theoretical- value for how much I can be 
double-stunning, by myself.  Ie, on top of the 'making sure every mob has 
at least one stun cast on it'.  So, substitute 198% up above. :) It's a 
theoretical figure assuming perfect connection and exact timing on the 
casting, in reality, I think it's probably more like one basic stun, 60% 
double stunned, and 5% triple stunned.  So for the sake of argument, call 
it 60% doublestunned, it'll make my math easier. :)

What this figure doesn't take into account, though, is mob resists, which 
are proportionate to the chanter's level.  In order for the chanter to be 
really effective, you can't have more than 5-15% resists.  (At some point, 
Martin said something about mobs 'partially resisting' stun.  I'm sure you 
didn't quite mean that, I've never seen a partially stunned mob. :) ) 

My experience is more with about 20-30 mob pulls than 50, but I seem to 
get about 10% resists. Ie, for each cast of stun, if we have about 25 mobs 
there, I see one to four resist messages, usually.  Now this is where the 
dual stunning figure comes in.  In order for a mob to actually hit me, it 
has to have resisted at leastone stun, probably two.  So, assumewe have a 
50 mob pull, 15% resists, 60% dual stunnage (still a single chanter).
On average, 7.5 mobs resist the first stun.  So 7.5*0.15*0.60=0.675 mobs 
will resist the second stun, and 3 mobs will not have had to face a 
second stun at all, for an average of 3.68 mobs active at any one time 
pounding on someone.  Hmm, that's pretty high. :) If your chanter's 
getting 15% resistage, he's probably too low level to go it solo here. :)

By similar calculations, 10% resists leaves 5 first stun mobs leading to 
0.3 dual resisters, and 2 not-dual-stunned.  So on average, that's 
2.3 active mobs, much more reasonable.  In both of these cases, I also 
have my targetted stun memmed specifically to stop one of those guys in 
his tracks, too.

I have faith in a cleric to be able to heal me while I tank one or two low 
blue mobs for a few seconds.  Especially since the mob frequently decides 
to be angry at a nuker instead of me, mid to late in the fight, so the 
damage gets spead around a little.  And, which mob I'm tanking changes 
every 8 seconds, because it's a different resister, so he seems to spend 
at least half the time crawling forward in the pack to get at me or a 
nuker, or running the yard and a half from nuker 1 to nuker 2.  The one 
time ping-ponging is good. :) And I'm not even gonna mess with 
triple-stunning or I'll get a headache. :)

These numbers also get a lot lower if it's a less than 50 mob pull, which 
I prefer anyway, because it's just a bit more relaxed. :)

The figures also go way down if you get two enchanters, since you're 
looking at complete triple stunning and quadruple stunning in significant 
amounts.  Either that, or both chanters relax more. :)  Complete triple 
stunning is pretty easy.  Chanceof a mob resisting 3 stuns s the cube of 
the basic resist rate (assuming the two chantes have the same resist rate, 
of course. :) ) so at 10%, they each have a one in a thousand chance of 
resisting all three stuns.

}Thing is, healing two chanters and a puller all at the same time strikes me
}as possibly (not probably, but possibly) dicy, and as you note, one of the
}chanters dies and you suddenly have a much riskier situation.

Or goes linkdead, or falls asleep at the keyboard because everyone 
insisted they -neeeded- him or he woulda gone to sleep hours ago... :)  
Here's the extra healer vs. extra nuker tradeoff:  You can heal two people 
at the same time, which honestly, you are unlikely to need to do very 
often.  The health bars go down pretty slowly, strangely enough, and 
usually one person's getting most of the pounding (chanter), then it 
switches (strongest nuker standing closest).  And possibly the MT if he's 
tanking something that wasn't stunnable.  The extra nuker, on the other 
hand, makes the time you have to worry about healing for that much 
shorter.  With 4 nukers, the cleric usually just threw me a baby heal 
after the fight, possibly one during, but not usually, and healed the 
pet tanking the dang mindworm thingy that got mixed in there. :)
3 nukers means the fight lasts 1.33 times as long, 2 nukers is twice as 
long.

}I don't think I was throwing heals out that were particularly better than
}what a druid could do, though.  While I'd want a cleric handy for rez
}in case of wipe, as far as operations go, does a cleric really offer any
}more than a druid does for this sort of thing?

Well, you can count on the cleric not to whine about how lame his heals 
are. :) I can't say for sure, I've always had a cleric there, except one 
time when it was a bunch of low greens (Grachnist camp in WW) and just me 
and a druid who'd just gotten upheaval and wanted to show off. :)

}On the other hand, if you have a druid you get fast transportation
}to your AOE destination... or to more than one if you find the first
}is occupied.  And you get an evac out... not useful for emergencies,
}of course (there is no AOE group emergency that can wait 9 seconds
}for an evac)

Yea there is...

<nuker1>  "Hmm, I'm geting a lot of resists..."
<nuker2>  "Yea, me too."
<nuker1>  "Think we'll make it?"
<nuker2>  "50 now"
<chanter> "I AoE tashed, don't look at me... :)"
<nuker3>  "they're starting to drop"
<nuker2>  "lom"

(it gets down to two mobs standing, one that dang unstunnable mindworm, 
and everyone at less than 5m, and the mage pet is about to die.  I
mez the guy I can while the cleric loots and the wiz/dru evacs us.)

}Plus, I enjoy hanging out with this particular druid, so I'd be
}willing to stretch unless its crippling to do so.

Do it.  Be sure to report back how it goes. :)
