Honestly, I don't think there is any way you're going to get your stuff 
back.

We had a similar problem with a member of our guild recently. He 
borrowed some pretty pricey weapons or borrowed large amounts of 
platinum and never paid them back.

So what we did was this:

We removed him from the guild immediately. 

We told him that once he paid back everyone in the guild that he owed 
something to, the officers would consider allowing him back into the 
guild (surprisingly, he was actually quite disappointed that he was 
removed). So far, the vote is leaning towards NOT allowing him back in, 
but since he hasn't paid everyone back, they aren't even considering it.

We talked to the members/leader of his other guild (one that he'd joined 
with an alt) just to warn them of what he'd done to us, so they could be 
prepared if it happened to them.

That might not be much help, but if anything, it should tell you that 
just because someone is a guildmate, it doesn't mean you should 
necessarily trust him/her.

There's lots of people in my guild that I trust. There's also a few that 
I don't.  Same as real life, I suppose.
