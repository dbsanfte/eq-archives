Its gunna take forever.

I have killed hundreds of those giant wood
spiders, and have never seen either a patella or a
thorax. I did get the femurs though.

Killing ordinary giant spiders seems to make
either, another giant spider, or a giant wood
spider, spawn in almost the same location....
sometimes. Or, it might be my imagination. 

Don't kill that bastard Gunrich.

Good luck.
