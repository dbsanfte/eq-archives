Im pretty sure im right in saying Prexus has a far higher population than
your server (oldest non-split server.. damnit) and theres still places to
find exp.

Velk pits, Velk tents (anywhere away from the great fcfs spider race),
chardok, some seb camps, HS, a lot of luclin zones.. theres plenty of places
where you won't run out of mobs.

I did skyshrine for a few weeks, with zero downtime (nice empty place).. and
spent the last week or so in kael arena..  again with no downtime.

The Arena kindof surprised me actually.. I always remember 20-40 people in
arena raids, with lots of deaths :)  We had me running my 60 monk, and
botting 60cleric/60shaman, and a friend, 60 monk.. we could keep all the
prots down, and (I forget his name in the centre of 2 prots by vindi..) and
gladiators/SoM guy etc

Did Velk Pits last night, again me botting 3 chars, and with zero downtime
(and when im playing 3, its not uncommon for me to not bother sitting the
chars after every heal/buff)

Just find somewhere away from the masses..
