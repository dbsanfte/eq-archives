From what i've heared is that FT stacks with KEI (and thus also with
breeze/clarity) So either FT is not in slot 2, (or the other ones not)
unless i've been misinformed.

Exceptions to the rule are dots wich stack even from the same line, and if
dotts come from different ppl the effects even stack if it is the same
spell, wich is very usefull for lower druids in UP trying to obtain elysian
armor. (this used to be different till i thnk last year neovember)
