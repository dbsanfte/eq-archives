Great, now how about adding a lower level version (say level 30 or so) and a
higher level version; the current pet is only really useful from 54 (when you
get it) to 60, when its damage output really starts to fall behind, unless you
are farming greens.  At that, its still better than the druid pet, which is
never useful for anything but farming...

What?  It had a DS?  Not that a DS that can be cast every 18 minutes for 18
seconds makes any sense... but I don't remember ever seeing a DS message from
it.

Excellent, it -should- be more mana efficient to use HOTs than to use real
heals.

I never had any problem targetting pets with or without a mount, anyone out
there ever get the problem they are fixing?

And what if the caster of the AE rain dies and then his rain kills the mob, does
the mob vanish?

I don't remember ever having this problem, but maybe its because my bard almost
never has any reason to target himself.  Clicky on SS bracer, if playing MA, but
how often does a bard MA?  Oh, and bandaging, back when I did melee mobs I'd
bind wounds while singing heal, got to 50% health even quicker that way.

This is good, when I first saw it mentioned I thought they were saying that AotZ
and BAotR would stack with the focus line, which would have been even better,
but this is still helpful.  Why did they make it so BAotR is still overwritten
by Fot7 though?  I mean, if you -want- Fot7 you can just click BAotR off...

Hmm, are they going to continue to lie about what attributes are good for, or
did they decide to start telling the truth?  "Lie" may be unfair, perhaps they
genuinely believe that stats work the way they claim...

Oooh, how about a progress bar showing how the zone load is progressing?

Invisible?  Do you mean, look like a sword thru the body part?  Cause thats not
exactly the same thing.
