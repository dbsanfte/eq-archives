True enough.  Hmm... but I bet there's people who'd pay a pretty penny for 
an old Altair.  

Thing is, you keep talking about Corvettes as if they're -all- showroom 
classics that someone pumped $8K into.  My one classic car (White 69 Volvo 
1800S... Just like Roger Moore drove in The Saint.  God I love it. :) ) 
cost $750... Of course, the bumper promptly fell off...
