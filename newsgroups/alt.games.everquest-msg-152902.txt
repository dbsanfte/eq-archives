Depend on what kind of mob and if someone are around. If noone is near 
the mob and its lootable, loot it. If i for example play my monk, and 
are killing something i know only drop pp one in maybe 20 kills, and no 
gem loots, but drop copper, silver, and gold every time, im not gonna 
bother to loot the corpse, since all i get from it are to press destroy 
on coins all the time.

If were talking some big boss mob (for example ragefire) and there are 
20 people standing around it, theyll be discussing who get what loot, 
and you would be ninja looting if you ran over and snatched a CoF and 
Dragon Hunters Satchel. Same goes if a group is standing just beside the 
corpse.
