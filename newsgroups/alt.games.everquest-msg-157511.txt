You misunderstand.  I *want* to be in a primarily raiding guild.  I *want*
to primarily raid.

This is a unique situation.  With PoP, we suddenly have: A) new territory to
explore; B) new levels to obtain.  Since obtaining 65 could be of tremendous
benefit to the guild, I thought they'd give us some leeway to XP *so that we
can become better at raiding*.  Not because I actually enjoy the leveling
treadmill, but because jumping on the treadmill will give me new abilities
and spells that will make me a better raider.
