He's not going to do 5 years, either. Verant aren't going to press
charges against a 17 year old. It would be a public relations
nightmare. I don't give a rusty fuck if he 'deserves' to go to prison
for 5 years or not. It's not going to happen.

I think what this kid did was a hilarious slap in the face to Verant.
Not only did he gain GM status, but he also got into the computer of
the president of the company. Wonder why it took so long to be
reported? Because Verant didn't report it. A third party reported it.
Verant obviously didn't want people to know about this because it's
such an embarrassment. This kid had access to all of our credit card
numbers and our user names and passwords. If some teenager was able to
do it and get caught only because he made some blatant mistakes,
imagine how many talented hackers could have done it (and may still be
doing it) without being detected.
