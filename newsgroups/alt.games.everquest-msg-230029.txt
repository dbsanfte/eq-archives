More specifically, AC way below the ATK rating of the mob that's hitting
you is about the same as no armor at all, and AC way above its ATK
rating really do you any good beyond something closer to its ATK rating.

Example (with made-up numbers).  If a mob has an ATK rating of 500,
AC changes in the ATK +/- 50 range will make a noticeable difference
in how hard you get hit, but anything beyond that makes little difference.
So AC = 1 to 450 is about the same as having no armor at all (against
that mob), and AC = 550 to 9999 is all about the same as well (the
mob will hit you for the minimum amount it's going to).  In between
(450 to 550), adding or losing AC will make real differences in
how well you can tank the mob.  So in that case the "soft cap" for
that mob (and others with similar ATK ratings) will be about 550.
It's an "effective" cap based on the way mob melee damage is calculated.

So your "point of diminishing returns" on AC depends very much on
what mobs you generally fight (or at least the ones you tend to get
hit by).

A related rule of thumb is that you should shoot for roughly
MaxHP = AC * 3 (at least as a tank-type class).  When MaxHP > AC*3,
your low AC will "waste" your high HP by having it get "eaten up"
too fast when you get hit (for lack of armor).  When MaxHP < AC*3,
your sturdier armor will not effectively save you from your
"fragile" amount of HP.  MaxHP = AC*3 is a good compromise
to keep in mind when you're trying to choose between an AC-heavy
armor piece and a +HP armor piece.  It makes for a well-rounded
tank.
