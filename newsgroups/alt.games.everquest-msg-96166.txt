As a level 45 Beastlord I kinda have the niche down on playing with a
pet, yet tonight some enchanter in DL I have never seen before joined
our group - 3 of the people out of the 6 of us have grouped before,
the other 3 I have never seen before. Well, of course the pulls start
usually 2 or 3 at a time and the enchanter mezzes them. I usually
NEVER instigate the AGGRO as I know better, and that is the tanks job.
Well the mezzing starts and the tanks start hitting but the enchanter
is screaming we are screwing her mez up. I always /assist the 2nd tank
or wait till the enchanter directs which one to start fighting first.
Well of course somehow half of us are on a Drol Rager, and the other
half on a second one, while the chanter is still screaming. I pull
back, and pull my pet back too, and ask, who the heck am I supposed to
help? And I get in return that my darn pet aggroed the second rager
and that I should destroy the pet because I can't control it.
Meanwhile my pet has 100% life left, so how the heck could he have? I
usually turn taunt off, because pet is not the tank, and I know the
pet was in on the /assist with me so....

I am glad I know at least 50 others in DL that can back me up (that I
am a good beastlord), and when I said I was not going to destroy my
pet who was doing quite a bit of damage the Enchanter disbanded the
whole group like a baby, and said he was going to KC instead. I have
never grouped with this chanter before, and I plan on never doing it
again. I dont want to mention their name because it is not right to do
that, but come on play, its just a darn game. From now on I take
grouping with Chanters that I do not know with a HUGE grain of salt.
