Check out the scout forums (Assassin is the one I'm familiar with), the
Combat forum, and I'm guessing the Wizard forums (though I have never
bothered to read them).  There are more and more threads popping up
about how overpowered scout classes are compared to wizards in terms of
damage taken, damage absorbed and group utility.  Although the few
wizards that seem to be trying to start the campaign claim that they
don't want scouts to get hit with the nerfbat, they constantly state
how the medium armor, quick refresh times on medium power hits, utility
with no power, and group utility means nobody even looks for a wizard.


Since there is no PvP in this game, there haven't been many direct
comparisons yet.  As the game matures and more log parsers are released
(I know of two), expect more nerf calls to be made.
