Never having played a warrior for very long, I'm not familiar with the
newbie quests for warriors.  But if you want to talk to a specific NPC, you
have to target it and hail it.  (Just hitting the H button after targetting
something will have you hail.)  With most quest givers, they don't give you
all the information in one paragraph.  You have to say specific words to get
more information.  Those words are inside of brackets.  For example:

You say, "Hail, Uber Warrior Trainer"
Uber says, "Why hello there, Noobwarrior!  Are you [new to Freeport]?"
You say, "I am new to Freeport."
Uber says, "Welcome!  I could really use help killing a [mean thing]."
You say, "What mean thing?"
Uber says, "Go kill this, that, and the other.  Collect for me these goodies
and give them to me, and I'll give you a nice reward!"

Once you start fighting the orcs in East Commonlands, collect their belts.
You can turn them into one of the warrior trainers for experience.

What server are you on?  What's the name of your warrior?
