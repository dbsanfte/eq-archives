Print the map off to help, if you haven't already then swim for it,
hopefully you won't aggro any of the 50+ lvl Sharks...j/k.  You'll be fine,
I'd actually say swim across to the island to your west and then over again
this will get you to the ogre/spiroc island (Spirocs won't aggro but the
Ogres will, not hard to avoid tho) and get the raft back to Oasis but if you
would prefer the longer swim then head south to the elvish outpost, no they
won't agro you, they're wood elves. Catch a shuttle here to back to Butcher
or FV but you'll have a longer wait for shuttles than you will for the rafts
to Oasis.

AFAIK there is nothing of threat in the water around these islands (fell off
myself once) as for stamina when it runs out swimming you just carry on
swimming, don't even think you slow down.
