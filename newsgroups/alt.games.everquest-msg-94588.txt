Well, I have played fifteen different characters across several different
classes, all of them are between level 22 and level 44. I am currently
trying my first druid, a level 20 halfling, on the Firiona Vie roleplaying
server. I don't profess to be any sort of an expert but I have always
assumed, rightly or wrongly, that EQ is all about balance. The implication
being that, if I was given SOW to use, it was to compensate me for a lack of
something else. Consequently, if I provide SOW to someone they are getting
an (unfair?) advantage over me and I ought to be compensated in some way.
Whether I choose to ask for some sort of compensation or not is not the
issue. As far as I am concerned, players can charge whatever they like for
anything as long as they specify the charge up front.

Casting costs mana, recovering mana costs time and lack of time equates to
lack of exp. There is lots more to the game than that and that is why I
enjoy starting from scratch so often, doing trade skills, questing and not
twinking but the basic fact is that casting for others costs exp and I am
pretty sure that the game balance does not take that into account. My 44
enchanter basically sat around for seven or eight levels, mainly at the
windmill in LoIO on Tunare, dispensing breeze and clarity for free and every
time that she did that she saw her peer group progressing far more rapidly
than she did both in exp and financially.

The other thing is that, being on the roleplaying server Firiona Vie, with
it's consequent reduction on overall twinking everyone seems to be poorer
and I have found that, despite the knowledge and experience I gained from my
other characters on other servers, at level 20 my druid is the poorest by
far of all the characters, not having managed to buy all the level 14 spells
and only having bought four of the level 19 spells. Ring of Sureglade alone
costs 17pp!!! and the full set of level 19 spells costs nearly 200pp. With
only four spells purchased and half way thru level 20 she has 12pp to her
name and that is after getting 5pp (the only donation ever) for one SOW.
It's a lot of good being a tailor and particularly a fletcher when you can't
auction out in the field and it's a hell of a problem grouping (and staying
alive, hehe) to get exp when you can't understand what your fellow groupies
are saying. SOW is about the only thing that she can make money on
(especially now there are self-binders in every town) and she doesn't ask
for payment.When she gets port ability she is certainly going to charge
(lol, even though she can't ooc to that effect).

Anyway, how often when you are soloing do you see a melee class step in and
say "Hey, the mob is below half way, let me finish that off for you so you
can get the exp and, meanwhile, you can sit and regain your mana". Fat
chance.
