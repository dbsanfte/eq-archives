He (hastrom bootstrutter, or some such... quest NPC in Rathe Mtn. zone)
doesn't accept plat. You have to give him 3,250 *Gold* pieces, a no-drop
shadowed rapier, and the Ring of the Ancients which is dropped by the
Ancient Cyclops. Allegedly you get a set of no-drop Journeyman's Boots
in return. (Sure hope so.. I'll be trying it today.)
