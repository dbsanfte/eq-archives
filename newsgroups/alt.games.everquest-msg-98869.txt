Sure...np...

/hitsmode <"my", "me", or "other">  <"on", "off", "M2", "M3", "M4", or "M5">
<X> <Y> <COUNT> <FONTSIZE> <HEADER> <BG> <WIDTH>

In the above, "my" means the hits that you character does, "me" is the hits
done TO your character, and "other" is all other hits (PCs to NPCs, NPCs to
PCs, etc.)

The second parameter (on, off, m2, m3, etc.) tells what to show in the hit
box. Toy with the M2 through M5 to see what you like. For instance, M5 will
just show "CRUSH 26" whereas M3 will show "CRUSH AN ORC FOR 26."

The X and Y are the coordinates on the screen of the upper left part of the
hit box. Not sure if this changes with the resolution, but I would think it
would. X is the left-right aspect and Y is top-bottom aspect. (0,0 is in the
upper left corner.)

Count is the number (from 1 to 10) of lines that appear in the hitbox.

Fontsize is from 0 to 2, with 0 being smallest.

Header is a 1 or 0 that indicates whether the box has a header ("MY HITS" or
"OTHERS HITS", etc.) 0 indicates no header, 1 indicates a header.

BG is a 1 or 0 like above that indicates whether the box is transparent (0)
or has the same transparency level as your main chatbox (1).

Width is the width of the hitbox...

So, you can have three hitboxes (My, Me, and Other.) They can be positioned
anywhere on the screen and sized individually.

And here are some examples:



    /hitsmode my m3 0 1000 5 2 1 1 300

    The above line makes a box at 0,1000 (near the bottom left on one of the
higher resolutions) that shows the hits your character does. The box has 5
lines, a header, is 300 units (pixels?) wide, is the same transparency as
the chatbox, has the largest available fontsize, and shows who you hit for
how much with what type of weapon (SLASH AN ORC FOR 10).



    /hitsmode me m5 0 0 10 0 0 0 100

    The above line makes a box in the upper lefthand corner of the screen
that has 10 lines of text, no header, is 100 units (pixels?) wide, is
transparent, has a small fontsize, and just tells you how much you hit for
and what type of hit it was (SLASH 10).

That answer your question? :)
