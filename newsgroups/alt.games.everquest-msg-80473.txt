By and large, that was the only point I was trying to argue.  Perhaps
my thoughts on the subject run counter to yours.  Perhaps I did not
express them well enough (text is a lousy perveyour of thought).  In
the end, it doesn't matter.  My opinion is mine, and yours is yours.
We have no real arguement on any of it.

I was 'brought up' to believe that using guards as a primary safety
net was a (putting it mildly) sissy way of doing things.  I don't
entirely agree with that notion, but I do believe that parts of it are
quite valid.

I also believe, that as a person paying the same $10us a month as
everyone else, that Troll, Ogre, DE or Iksar has every right to gank a
guard to build faction, if that is what it takes.  WC, while not
exactly high level, is far from a newbie area either.
