That it is adequate for xp'ing as part of a random collection of
clueless fuckwits at L58 does not make it equal.  It's still less than
half what the Cleric can do, and there're lots of folks playing EQ for
whom that difference is enormous.

First, Shaman slow is superior to Enchanter slow.  Second, my response
was re: a straight-up substitute for a Cleric in a group.  And I was
pointing out the in most xp groups the combination of Shaman slow and
Shaman healing was already superior <prior to the new Druid/Shaman
heals going live>, so the addition of these heals didn't really change
that situation.

Any pick-up group that chooses additional members solely based on
character class don't have a fucking clue what character would be
better for them.

My main is a Paladin.  a_random_pick_group01 rarely invites a Paladin
over <anybody> else.  And it's even rarer that it is worthwhile to be
part of such a group.  So I don't really give a flying fuck how most
pickup groups work, because I'm not part of them.  I do know that the
typical pickup groups I've seen (aka collections of clueless dumb-asses)
will watch me soloing mobs at half the rate they're killing them with
their group of four and still not want a Paladin in their group because
they're not fighting undead.  "Most" pickup groups live a "blind leading

the blind" existence, if joining them is how you validate yourself in

EQ then you're a damned fool.  Pickup groups led by knowledgeable
players, otoh, seem often to have an odd makeup, as the leader avoids
adding known idiots, regardless of the character classes involved,
preferring an unknown character of a less desirable class over any
number of well equipped "better class" idiots.
