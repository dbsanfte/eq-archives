>Too much for my brain.  But I got the part about it getting better as I
>level.

Hey hon. Yeah, that kinda confused me too. Heres how it works, as
I understand it, and has been demonstrated by log parsing:

There are two "elements" to your AC total displayed on screen. One
is damage mitigation, the other is damage avoidance. In addition
to the AC provided by armour or agility the vital skill for you is
"defense". This will go up as you level, and improves as you tank
in combat, getting hit lots.

AC is one of the most important things for a ranger until about
level 45, 50 when the difference between you and a warrior begins
to get large enough that they pull ahead. At that point you want
to start considering going for resist and stats gear to maximise
your damage output while letting someone else take the hits. Use
root and jolt to manage aggro.

In order, I'd say your current priorities at your level should be:

Haste, AC, HP, Resists, Wis, Dex - anything else is pretty much
ignorable, although again later on you'll want to pay some attention
to your stamina.

Higher AC makes a difference to the damage you take - even if it lowers the
averagge hit by (for example) 2 points in a fight where you get hit 100 times
thats a 200 point HP saving;  if you're still tanking (and at your level theres
no reason not to) thats significant.

Strength is almost totally irrelevant for anyting but carrying
capacity. Go get yourself some weight reducing bags. Affordable
items may be:

Memento Box (sol a)
Archeologists pack (Najena?)
Shralock paackl (Highpass)
Dusty ransackers backpack (Kaesora)
Evil eye bag (Lower guk)

In roughly cheapest to most expensive order. As you dont sound
twinked you will find it takes a while to save up for them but its
well worth it - think of it as an investment.

If you can carry a ton of fine steel you can sell it and make money
back. I personally have one of each of the above (most are lore)
and a Tinkers Bag. The bag is great, but costs 5250pp - its 100%
weight reduction, 10 slot, holds any size items. If you can get an
evil eye bag that shoul dod you for a while, 75% reduction, 8 slots,
about 200pp on my server now.

>
>I'm not wearing +2 STA earrings, I'm wearing +2 AGI earrings for a total of
>+4 AGI.

Dump them - try to get gold topaz earrings from a jeweller, they have AC, or
some orc fang earrings on the cheap (many people just destroy them in velious
now).

>I am wearing +2 STR rings, total +4 STR.

Think about jagged bands from Unrest, relatively cheap and have
both strength and AC on them.

>The belt is AC3 +2 STR and STA, not +3 on the stats.

Thats ok - but for the minimal stat loss you might want to think
about a thick leather apron for more AC or a giant straw belt (AC
10 but very heavy).

You dont mention your cloak but a cloak of the ice bear can be had
pretty cheapoly usually and is AC 7 +20 resist cold + some hp, I
think, and helps out against certain casters.

Also think about a bloodstained mantle (low ac shoulder item, but
+10 resist magic and some strength)

Final piece of advice - if you're going to play and love your ranger
start practicing archery now while its easy ;)
