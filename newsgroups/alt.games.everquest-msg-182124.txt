I'd think that an SK could easily find a twisted pleasure in wearing
gear he found to be loathsome in appearance.  It'd be a continuous
irritant, constantly poking at his deeply repressed self-loathing and
thereby maintaining his hostility towards and hatred of the world and
all that is in it at a higher level than he had been able to sustain
before.

Or are you one of those limp-wristed DEs, overfond of comfort and
leisure, obsessed with appearance over substance, not truly consumed
with the hatred the destroys all, a mere poseur of Innoruuk.
