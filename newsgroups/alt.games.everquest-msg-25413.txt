    Pre-Kunark, yup. What ELSE would you put in that slot? Oh, they have a
higher resist than the cleric Sol Ro gloves IIRC.

    Yes, but they were BEST AVAILABLE.

    Except that you have to camp Warlord a MONTH to see cleric boots, or
cleric gaunts. Saying "go get your Donal's Boots" isn't really reasonable
when they drop once in a frigging blue moon.

    Not compared with the other things I could have been wearing. What else
would I have on? GEBs, Splitpaw Gloves, some other random piece of tissue
paper armour? Come on, Sang - name these "better" pieces I could have had.
Same goes for most of the other classes - there wasn't better available.

    /auction WTB Crushed Flame Emerald, paying my left arm. Yup, that ONE
gem is the biggest pain in the whole set. I assume I'll never get Velious
boots for that reason.

    I'm a dwarf - I don't kill other dwarves. ;-)
