IMO, the FV server's ruleset is only really a "bone" thrown to people
with a very specific style of RP in mind. Overall, there's only so
much they can do to make the game RP friendly, especially if they want
to still entertain those who aren't into the RP. You can RP in EQ just
fine because, ultimately, RP-ability is what you make it and who you
choose play with.

If you're serious about RP and want an RP group to game with, then
check out the Wind Rider/Shadow Striders on Tunare.

They're coming out of a bit of an RP lull due to events in the lives
of the leaders keeping them away from the game a lot lately, but
leadership is in the hands of an officer from each guild now, and
they're working to liven things back up. Membership dropped off during
the lull, and we're working on being more visible to attract fresh
blood.

We're a "family RP" guild, meaning if you're looking for active
raiding, look elsewhere. :p We have some high level guys in the guild,
including one of the most knowledgeable players on Tunare that I've
ever met (Dracoliss), and they do tend to haunt some high level areas,
but guild organized raids are infrequent.
