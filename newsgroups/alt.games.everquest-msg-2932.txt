Murphy's law I guess... but I always seem to go LD in the middle of a tough
fight.

Was grouped with 5 others in Orc Hwy in Oasis.  We pulled 3 Orcs (2 priests
and a warrior) and got a DB skeleton wandering add on (not on purpose).  So
this was a toughie for a low teens group

Ench had mezzed a few of the orcs, but I was losing packets and didn't
realize it, so all the mobs looked mezzed to me, so I was just /assisting
the main tank which by accident was a mezzed mob (not anymore).  Well, I
went LD and eventually came back up.  Luckily we made it thru w/out losing
anyone (Darn if I  didn't get exp).

Just had gotten a cable modem yesterday so I thought I wouldn't have these
problems from the client side.  No one else in the group had any packet
loss, so I don't know if I can blame the server.

Oh well, never seem to go LD when I'm trading at a merchant, or sitting in a
group.
