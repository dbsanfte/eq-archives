I love it when people provide their own answers to questions.

Because different characters will use different portions of the interface.

The toggle thing is a good idea though.

I imagine if you are willing to  tinker offline its easy to copy
and paste your basic setup to all your characters, like you can
your friends list.

Btw, what I can't see is why you need different friends list and different
ignore list per character on a given server.  OK, if you are sharing the
account with someone they will have different friends (and opinions
as to who is an idiot) but we aren't supposed to do that, are we?
