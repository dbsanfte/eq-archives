The only problem with your position is, it allows the guilty to go
free.  This policy is targetting for banning those people who are
sharing "GUILD" accounts, and then whinging that their items are
missing.  Unfortunately,  In dragging the wide net to catch these
guilty, some innocent will be punished, It is regrettable, but a chance
of punishing the innocent is not a valid(IMHO) reason to avoid punishing
the guilty.
