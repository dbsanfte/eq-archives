That quest is very difficult since you need to get cooperation from 4 other
classes and no-one wants to put up with the lag of hollowshade moor for a
long quest with questionable reward.  I eventually found 3 others to trade
with (or they found me), and then said screw it.  I made a shaman and
skilled him up in the required trade.  Made all his kills for him and logged
him in just long enough to loot the kills.   Made the item, dropped on
ground, logged in bard, et voila!
