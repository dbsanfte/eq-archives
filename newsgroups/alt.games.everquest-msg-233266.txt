Which mobs?  I've yet to see a place where that still works.

Right.  That's how we used to do it.  I just tried this night before last.  
First, brownies now con threatening by default rather than scowls.  I 
didn't have an actual wolf form to test with, but minor illusion and 
illusion: tree had zero effect (and those used to work).  Alliance was 
insufficient.  This was an issue that came up right after the patch I 
mentioned, and as a result, those spells are now available on a merchant 
in highkeep.
