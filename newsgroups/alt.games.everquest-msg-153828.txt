<<snip bitter rant>>

Well, until reading your diatribe I had been indifferent to the upcoming
nerfs, but now I am getting a warm fuzzy feeling in the pit of my stomache.
You know why? Yup, that's right - I am an asshole.

Not only that, I am an asshole sitting down, happily drinking my coffee,
completely unaffected by the changes but knowing full well they have kicked
<you> repeatedly in the balls and your hurting.

Please describe in more detail exactly how sore your ass feels at the
moment? How about your chest, does it feel tight? Are you mad as hell? Is
there spittle on your monitor?

*smiles*

Ahh - it's a good day to be an asshole. You Sir, have made my day.

Cheers
