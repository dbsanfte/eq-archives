Mmmm, not really. You'll talk to Server GM's, and very occasionally you'll
see a Lead. Neither of whom really has loads of input when it comes to the
direction the game goes in, they really only make suggestions like any
player. The GM's are very very similar to phone CSR's(and from what I
understand, that's part of their duties too).

When it comes to being a Guide, it's much more work and headache than a free
EQ account is worth. Been there, done that, got the t-shirt, quit happily
after 8 months.
