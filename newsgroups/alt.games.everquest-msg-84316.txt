And those gems are on the "planar" gem table, but also drop regularly in
some high end expansion dungeons, most notably Sebilis, they're also on the
quest reward table for the bulthar trunk/ulthork tusk quest in Cobalt Scar.
Nothing in particular drops "only" diamonds jacinths or black sapphires, but
rather has a chance to drop them off of the gem table, such as how, say,
blackburrow gnolls, only have low end gems like Lapis Lazuli and malachite
on their gem table.

As far as I can tell, when the loot is loaded up, it randomly decides
between nothing, gem, uncommon_item and rare_item for however many slots the
monster can drop stuff in, then tosses "always drop" stuff in, and perhaps a
seperate slot for "trash" loot like undead frog tongues.   At least this is
the very general description and kind of breaks down with rare spawns who
always drop something (eg grachnist and the iksar scale gloves, with rarely
something else on him)  Note, not everything even loads the gem table at
all, using the blackburrow example, only gnolls even have the possibility of
loading a gem, the giant snakes can only have snake loot, such as fangs and
skins.

Also, all of this doesn't quite work if you have a_bored_uber_06 handing out
rubies to random gnolls for fun.
