I only port for a "please" I'll accept a "pls" if worded ok and that's about
it.
If you have a constant demand for ports then they can be pretty lucrative
but these days I see a lot being advertised and not taken up. I am imagine
low 40's and below you can make more cash porting than hunting, especially
if your hunting is solo.
Personally I have found no fun in porting for plat and since that's the only
reason I play EQ I'd be more likely to follow your "don't have anything of
importance to do" example and log off.

Never saw EQ as important, only a fun way to pass time.
