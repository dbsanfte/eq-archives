Perhaps they mean a reposte will not trigger the weapon effect, except
for a reposte on the one mob the warrior has targeted.  

Before I quit, there was a tactic of bringing a large train to
warriors equiped with damaging AOE effect weapons.  The warriors would
go into "reposte all attacks" mode; the sheer number of mobs being
reposted meant there was massive AOE process (earthquake as I recall
was the process of choice) -- enough to kill the mobs or at least
enough to let the warrior keep aggro.
