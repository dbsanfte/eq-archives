Hi all,

Had a fun collection adventure the other day on my 43 Monk (with a 46
Cleric, 49 Sk, 46 Chanter, 42 Ranger, and 44 Shaman). We all zone and
everything seems fine we only needed to collect 23 fangs (mmcc) or
something, a very low number which meant it would be tough.

Well the ML starts collecting as we get 3 right off the bat on our
first 5 mobs, then she (Shaman) LD's. Now normally this would not mean
much but since this was the ML on a collection adventure and these
item are NO RENT we got majorly screwed. Well she  returns and we
resume, and switch ML's as well in the process, and darn lucky we did
as she went LD 3 more times finally leaving us for good after the
third with a 1/2 hour left and 7 more to collect. Well this really
made things interesting we are all about 1/2 health and just 5 of us
left to complete a tough task.

Needless to say that we fought each melee taking kinda turns till
either my mend popped or cleric had mana or chanter had another mob
break mez, but we actually completed the dungeon with about 3 minutes
left and each of us with hp's we could count on one hand! We ended up
with 3 augments as well which was nice, most were not great, but
decent (+4 cold res, etc) for our level.
