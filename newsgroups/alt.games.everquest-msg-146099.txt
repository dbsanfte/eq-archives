It's possible.  Under the previous system, they had to deal with maybe three
guilds squabbling over Ragefire once a week or so (or whatever the average
spawn time was).  Under the new system, if a lot of people in the backlog
take groups in to try for shards, they could have to deal with dozens or
hundreds of petitions over KSing in SF every day.
