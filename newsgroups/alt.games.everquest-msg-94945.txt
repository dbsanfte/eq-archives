i know i was generalizing(sp?) but hey you got to admit that IS the
image that is presented to the rest of the world, i know not all
americans think like that, but some have gone just a little over the
top with all that patriotism and defending the "true religion"

and wouldn't you get slightly annoyed if i started talking about "the
true religion is islam, all hail allah and his prophet Muhammed" (no
i'm not a muslim but some of my friends are)

i guess it was a bad idea putting that last note in the message, it
seems like most people missed my point with that little note in the
message
