I haven't had an attitude in any of my petitions. They basically
read...

"I was looting my corpse when the zones went down for an emergency
patch. When I logged back on my character and my corpse were both
naked. This was after the patch Wed afternoon."

I don't think any of the GM's would consider me an a**hole after
reading that.

I don't think I should be helped sooner than anyone else because I
have 3 accounts. All I'm saying is that my 40 bucks, your 13 bucks or
whatever your paying, should provide us with a little better customer
service.

Having a guide tell me a GM will be with me shortly, soon or whatever
other verbage they have used is not cutting it. If they are backed up
and can't get to me for a week thats fine....but tell me. Don't leave
me sitting there for 4 and 5 hours.

I spent another 4 hrs tonight with the character logged and didn't
even get a reply from a guide. So lets say I wait a couple days to let
them get caught up, will they ask me how come I waited so long and
tell me there is nothing they can do for me? How long do I have till
they can't roll me back or fix it however they fix it?
