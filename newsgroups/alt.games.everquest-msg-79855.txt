It's a confusing zone if you go by map.  Here are directions:

DMF & invis up.  Go to the drop-down opposite of the ramp out of the zone.
Float down ONE level only.
Run to the broken floor and jump down.
Make a VERY sharp right and follow that path until you see a big open area
and a big building thing.
This is the general border between living and dead (you may run into a dead
before you drop down at the entrance)

Get IVU'd and hang a right, going around that building.  Hang a right as
soon as you can and follow it around to the left until you see a big hole.
Easiest thing to do is jump down (a few hundred HP without lev).  When you
exit the bottom you'll see the church...it's the building in front of you to
the right.

I THINK you'll be fine if you want to enter the church (left side), run to
the far left corner and just contend with the 2 or 3 spawns that might aggro
you.  You'll have to do it without a pet unless you're pretty lucky about
channeling a pet cast.

If you want to play it safe instead of running into the church run behind it
to the far corner and just pull back to your pet the stuff that aggros you
as you make your way to the church entrance.

Root is because if you screw up and drop down two levels at the start and
one of the spiders sees thru invis you may be in trouble, with or without
FD.  But, I don't have a high level necro so I can't say for sure.  If you
love FD just have that handy instead.
