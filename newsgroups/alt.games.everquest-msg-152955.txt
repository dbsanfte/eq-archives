No, not really.  according to m-w.com, it means primarily heathen,and heathen
means primarily: "an unconverted member of a people or nation that does not
acknowledge the God of the Bible."

It also can mean a polytheist.  But generally, it means a non-christian.  
I more or less qualify, but my faith seems to change a lot.  Rarely if ever 
ends up on Christian, though.
