All I'm seeking here is convincing that these problems with the trials 
are insurmountable. Yet, because I don't necessarily take what I'm told 
as gospel when it doesn't decisively dispell all my points of issue, 
people take offense. You fail to give me irrefutable proof, yet I am just 
supposed to take it as truth? And you take such offense when I don't? Who 
needs a slice of humble pie?

How do *you* know Joe Schmoe didn't leave your guild because they were 
actually more interested in themselves than helping their guildmates? You 
don't. You can't. It's certainly convenient that he has the issue of the 
trials to point to though. Maybe Joe is actually a good guy and his heart 
*was* in the right place. You have no way of knowing that.

Give me something that proves that the trials are so nearly impossible 
and it will all make sense. Until I see that, I still have doubts. It 
doesn't help that I'm seeing other in this very thread speaking of 
passing with much less trouble than is being described by others.
