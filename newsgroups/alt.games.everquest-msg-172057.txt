Hard to tell with so short a name, and even if it was "Halas", it is 
well within Rohirrim naming conventions... On the other hand, if after 
telling him his sword was good, Aragorn had called the kid a lousy twink, *
that* would have been a clear EQ homage. :)

OT Re: The Two Towers (spoiler alert). I loved the movie, but Peter 
Jackson really needs to stop filling in with EFX and learn to trust his 
very fine cast. Theoden King's was under a spell, but METAPHORICALLY, 
not LITERALLY, dammit, and his coming out of it should have been a 
matter of good dialogue and good acting, not cheese.
