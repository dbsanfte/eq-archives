Yep did 1st badge easily in 15min and tried to do 2nd badge and the
interrogator wanders over to hermits and stands out the front doing nothing.
He was still there the next morning when I logged in.
This is on the Bristlebane server and I petitioned it the night I did
it,(only a guide on who could not help) and again in the morning when I got
back on.
A GM eventually replaied with "sorry that quest is not currently working".
It's a real shame actually. Nice set of quests.
