I *hate* that one.

I used to mem spells while "holding" items very often, now
I can't.

At first it was only a problem in the new UI if I was
riding a horse (it still worked while not on a horse).

Then, a few patches later, it started giving that stupid
(and inappropriate) error message *all* the time, horse
or not.
