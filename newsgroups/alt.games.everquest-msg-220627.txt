But at least I found him to be a convincing war hero!  Seen too many
sci-fi shows and movies where we're supposed to believe that the hero was
special because they told us so. After the first few episodes with Bruce
B., I didn't need anyone to tell me.  Can't say the same about sinclair,
I'm afraid. But I suppose that was part of the point...sinclair wasn't a
war hero.
