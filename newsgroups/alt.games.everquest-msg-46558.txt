Hail all!

I want to create an Ogre warrior and am looking for suggestions.

I've read quite a bit about starting a warrior and was wondering if someone
would care to give me some pointers as to how to allocate my points when
creating my character.

Some say that strength is the only way to go, other creation guides claim
dexterity reigns supreme while others say agility and/or stamina are what I
need most... it's all quite confusing!

Best regards,

Beginner
