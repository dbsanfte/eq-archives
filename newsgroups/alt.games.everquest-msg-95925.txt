Or even worse, high level players who dont know how to play their chars.
Got an enchaten on my server (wont mention name, everyone that play in 
DL probably knows by now) go to DL as a 39 chanter, and i was foolish 
enough to group with him (group of my 45 warrior, my friends 46 shammy, 
and his 39 chanter).
Think he made around every error in the book, and then some more, first 
time i ever saw a chanter break his own mezz due to lack of knowledge on 
his other spells. And first time i ever saw a 39 chanter insisting on me 
dual pulling because he can mez, and after 3 big med breaks due to him 
being too low to mezz the mobs, HE go pulling 2 mobs while im finishing 
one off.
Luckily he went LD after that, do avioded kicking him out (should have 
done earlier, but im too nice). We even got better XP after he left.

Met a bard the next day who had grouped with him for a few min, left 
group when the guy insisted that the bard should stop playing mana song 
because it overwrote his Clarity.

After that the guy is appearantly relying on new players in DL to get 
XP, because most people know about him. Saw him ding a few days ago, 
only time in DL i saw a Ding where the ONLY response to it came 2 min 
later, and was "Noone cares".

Best part is that the guy just tried to join our guild. Posted a request 
about it on out guild boards (missing the New Members Sign Up Here part, 
and instead posted on the "Notices, do NOT post here" board.
As soon as i saw it i warned one of our officers about him, and 
appearantly a 4 or so more people did the same a few hours after the post.
