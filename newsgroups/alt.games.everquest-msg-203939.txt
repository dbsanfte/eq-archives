Interesting example, seeing that Avocets are 30ish and so would be
yellow/red to a L27.  Also, the lame-o single spawn campers have
already found a way to achieve risk-free xp, my comment was about
people who are out crawling dungeons and discover that the xp just
doesn't stop being excellent until long after the mobs they're
fighting become patsies.  It's easy to be seduced by this, even for
people who don't normally seek out the easy road.  To the point
that people who know better are getting all upset over somebody
dying due to being left behind on evac, when before they would've
happily sucked it up and gone back in to refine their tactics.

That, if it actually happened, would probably be a good thing.

Doesn't really matter.  Meleeing is not an efficient way for a Druid
to xp.  We're not talking about a Half Elven Druid wearing raw-hide
in 1999.  All that's required is to be a survivable soloer.  Were I
to be playing a Paladin in the crew I'm hanging out with I'd still
have to go off by myself for extra tanking time to max Defense.  And
if I were a Cleric I'd sure as hell be out getting beat on solo to
make sure I was tougher than any damn-fool Druid who was trusting to
leather armor to protect him from harm.

Even PoP mobs aren't an automatic death sentence to high end Clerics
who've maxed their Defense and HP and pushed their AC as well as they
can without sacrificing casting ability.  These guys are gonna be
insta-kills half the time when they're summoned by old-content mobs,
and stunned/interrupted two-shot kills most of the rest of the time,
it'll take a miracle to prevent their deaths when summoned in PoP.

Stupid thing clears LFG status when you zone, seems extra stupid
to a Druid who's accustomed to zoning every minute or so when LFG.
