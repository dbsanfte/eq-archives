It's not *everyone*, actually.   Four (IIRC) people on each server
have the title "of the Nexus" and can cast it from Norrath.  But
everyone else has to take the bus, err, spires.  ;)

The rationale, BTW, is that ports can only go a certain range.
Every place on Norrath works for Norrath ports;  every place
on Luclin works for the Nexus port.   Luclin is simply too far
away for a wizard to cast the port himself.  The spires themselves
(and the item given to wizards who have the "of the Nexus' title)
provide the power themselves to port the distance between
Norrath and Nexus.

It's a fairly nice touch, IMO.  I just wish they'd continued the
idea and made it so one couldn't port back down from the moon
without going through the spires.   It's inconsistent.   /shrug
