I've got a great example of this.

HoH group yesterday.  Group was 65 shaman, 62 enchanter (me on an alt), 65
ranger, 65 warrior, 64 paladin, 61 wizard.  Nobody was stunningly equipped;
all but the wizard was in my guild, and our best gear is NTOV.  I had a DC'd
pet for extra damage.  We had a corner opening into the hedge and were
pulling yard-trash and hedge mobs (Sargeant Bind-something, Foon Feem, that
crew).  I was doing both CC and slows, shaman was healing, ranger pulling -
and the MT was the paladin.  Why?  Simply because he had aggro NOW.  The
ranger would bring something home and I could target it and drop Tash and
Slow on the way in - because the paladin would hit it with two stuns and own
that mob like he was the local distributor for hate.  If we had two coming
in, the paladin would stun both at a distance, giving me time to root one
and slow the other and STILL not get aggro.  (Sorry, 62 chanter mezz wont'
work on most of those.)  On a threepull, our warrior would grab one - and
yes, she could offtank it until I had the one on the paladin slowed.  But
after the paladin had to camp and we had the warrior for MT, I had to wait
for our warrior to smack it several times before I slowed if I didn't want
to wear that mob - and that was when I was using hate-bending Visage spells.
Pull rate slowed perceptibly - not huge, but it was noticable.  The warrior
took noticably more damage due to a few rounds of unslowed mob and the lack
of damage mitigation due to stuns.

For those that are curious - the 65 warrior had full Skyshrine armor, using
her red-blade Epic in one hand and an NTOV Katana in the other (forget the
name, it's the negative-resists one).  Paladin was in partly-Skyshrine,
partly-PoP armor with some 2-handed stone-bladed axe looking thing.
