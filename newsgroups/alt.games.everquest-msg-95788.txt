What it means is that your regular run speed is better.  Run speed 
enhancements still work, but only compared to your normal run speed.  If 
run speed 3 is 30% faster than regular run, and SoW from your friendly 
druid is 45% faster than regluar run, SoW will still be 45% faster than 
regular run speed, NOT 45% faster than your run speed 3 speed.

Regular Run = 100
Run speed 3 = 130
Sow speed   = 145
Run 3 Sow   = 145
Run 3 Sow DOES NOT = 186
