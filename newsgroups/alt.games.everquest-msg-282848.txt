Depends on the faction.  With a lot of factions, there will be a 
faction-neutral NPC you can do a repeating quest with in order to get your 
faction up.  Or doing a quest for a faction you're already friendly with 
will also increase faction with another faction that hates you.

It's all very dependent.  eq.Allazhazam.com is a good place to go to search 
for faction-specific quests.  You'll almost always find a way to raise 
faction with people that hate you, even if that means killing a thousand 
mobs or doing a thousand turn-ins.
