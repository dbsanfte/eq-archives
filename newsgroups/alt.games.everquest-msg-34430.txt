Yeah, as per your second paragraph the good vs evil thing really
doesn't work at all on a regular server so its stupid to have a
"role-playing guild" with no evils since none of those characters are
really "evil" anyway.

Yes, exactly. You can't even really do those on the no rules sullen
zek server. A bard there training people with SGs was told he would
get banned if he kept it up although the server supposedly had no
rules against training, funny. Its like "we have no rules against
training unless you do it enough that someone cries and we notice it."
They claim it was because he was level 5 so no one could make
reprisals since he had nothing to lose but I think that is bunk, if he
was level 50 doing the same thing there is still not much people could
have done really and I bet verant still would have told him to stop.

Yeah, plus too many people equate evil to killing babies and good to
healing people or whatever. True evil only serves to further the cause
of evil and is usually more like the Lawful Evil alignment of Ad and D
rather than the chaotic evil alignment. If you look at Dark elves,
their city, culture, etc they don't seem "chaotic" evil to me.

We do, its called sullen zek, but its good evil and neutral.

Hmm the entire server you describe is basically sullen zek in one way
or another, where have you been? A non pvp roleplaying server of
similar type is in the works too.
