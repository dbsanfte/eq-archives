1. Is there a site that has all (or most) of the Vah Shir quests, and steps for
them, listed (especially Warrior)? Allakhazam only has the Beastlord handwrap
quest and a few other bits and pieces of info posted.

2. Is there any place in Shar Vahl to buy armor, or do I have to find my way to
the Bazaar?

3. Is the crude bone short sword that is given for turning in grimling skeleton
femurs upgradeable or used in other quests? (Its worse than the beginning short
sword, as is, but I use a cracked staff, anyway)

4. What do you get for turning in the mushrooms and moss to Drongam Runghi?
