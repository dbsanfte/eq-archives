I have a few questions about SoL

1) Will it require Velious (I'm going to get it sometime anyway, just
curious)

2) Is this "Wyrm Queen" on the diety selection part of character creation
the god of the new race? I'm assuming that preparations are being made for
SoL from now seeing BST and VAL on the class/race descriptions on items.

3) What will be the system requirements for the new graphics? My computer
plays it fine with 128 meg of ram and 64 meg TNT2 card, although animation
in Kunark is sometimes choppy.

4) What is the level range for the new zones (excluding the newbie zones for
the new race of course)?

Thanks for indulging me.
