I had this same problem after trying creatives new XP driver,  I alos found
that my Midi music started to skip again in the game.  What you are hearing
isn't feedback it is the EAX reverb going nuts.  In fact it can be
dupilacted outside of the game.  After it happens exit out and go into your
AudioHQ.  Grap the reverb and slide it up it should happen again.  I was
able to fix all my problems by using the MS driver by using the rollback
driver option found in XP.  Leave your acceleration set to full.  I get EAX
and Midi sound in the game.  Something I could never get to work with Win2k.
