We've been doing reflag this week, last night was inktu'ta.. while
explaining the strat for the final mob, a druid asked in guild, "are we
going to use that <class> thing?"  We only have 2 of said class, and i was
in their channel at the time - both told me they hadn't told him.. sooo..
change that "might" to will, have, and are doing so!

Well no such luck, the anueks still tore our clerics =)
We don't do the event much, and lots of the guild were still new to it.  Im
not really sure what happened that day though, I like to think when im
leading raids Im pretty good at assessing when we have the upper/lower hand
and to change things, or when a wipe is imminent and the need to call
abort.. we had the crag at 50, ma/rt were still alive, bearers dead, then
door opens, 2 come in, ae bearer spawns, with a delay of like 15 seconds, my
2 "whos" went from 40 to 9.. :)  Much more painful was the fact I was sole
survivor (and this was the first time we'd never bothered to camp a bot
cleric or fd necro).. still, since the post HP slump things are back on the
rise! (HP again tonight though! uh oh)

Well yes, i know what you mean about what sortof bugs it and what fixes
it -- our strat is very different to yours though so i guess it was a bigger
deal for us to deal with the bug (without your kindof numbers, im not sure
there are many different methods of killing it really)
And yes, the clearing to it is a nightmare, it makes potime phase 3 look
interesting...

He drops "the" monk 2hander in the zone, and even i don't care for any
prolonged kills or farming of it.  I mean a lot of people say GoD isnt fun..
but HP makes most of the other stuff look good

Dog (ukun?) drops "the" rogue poker.. but well, with what spawns..  :)
We don't do crazy fluryer either, we just don't go that way. We do kill his
rampage brother, but he drops equally shit loots- 5mana 5hp regen aug!  Only
do him to make a safe room though.

Whats the ampitheatre?  You mean the HP looking mob with the anueks(?) on
stage, near crag/ramp ixt?
