The game is aimed at the Diablo II audience, and other people who prefer 
pseudo-MMORPGs without a monthly fee. I didn't dislike the trial, 
however, the "load areas on demand" stuff is a huge turn-off for me. I 
don't have cable or DSL (stuck with ISDN), and I don't really want to 
sit and wait fifteen or thirty minutes before I can continue playing. If 
they fix that, I'll buy a copy. If it's not changed, I'll pass.
