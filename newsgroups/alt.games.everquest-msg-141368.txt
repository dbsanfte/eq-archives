personally my favorite still is Forest loops... ppl trader them for 200pp...
when with CRAPPY cha you can vendor them for 235 (had 50cha on my cleric)
with good cha you can vendor them for 285... and then there's the fact that
the sell fast at 300 to other players... /shrug guess ppl are to lazy to
check heh
