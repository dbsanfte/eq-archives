As much as you dislike them.. AoW is still a pretty impressive kill.  I
mean, definately the number 1 mob in Velious.

I agree... an increasingly common tactic for 1 guild on the server to get
mobs, thats starting to irk us...

The first time they did this, they had 20 people pulling tormax ramp (but
setting up at the arch way, and not pulling the wingmen)
They obviously weren't ready to pull and kill Tormax, meanwhile we (40+
people) were restricted from pulling over them, to get to Tormax (we use
around ~28 people to drop Tormax, so 40+ was easy overkill)

We went off and killed Vindi and Statue, came back.. and still they were
just sat at the arch way... we thought fuck 'em, and went onto something
else, but we were pretty annoyed.

About 2 weeks ago we went to kill Itraer Vius (were a 95% primal guild, the
opposition guild im talking about has maybe 10% primal throughout)

Anyway there were 17 of them, 36 of us (a no brainer who has the raid
force).. they simply moved from the fallen pillar into the Itraer Vius room
(can't pull over them without them training)

Now normally both guilds try to defuse potential situations... whoever
doesn't have the force just leaves, so no tempers flare between us and them
etc..

Anyway one of our officers decided to call the raid... "lets not try and
piss off 'guild_x' so they have no reason to further fuck with us... it pays
to be nice when they return it in kind"

Last week, we had another big turnout, this time we were the first ones
there (with enough force to kill tormy).. during the tormy room pulls,
about 11 members of said guild ran past us, and sat at the arch way.

I mean what the fuck can you say to that?   We've about had it with their
bullshit tactics for jacking a mob.. I know "sorry, you were in my pull
path" is a common excuse for training.. but I really think in this scenario
its totally valid.

Im pretty sure next time they repeat the stunt, one of our monks is going to
use them as skittles (pins) and see if they can get a strike using Tormy/his
guards.  Im all for a race, and backing away if we lose, but it can still be
done in a respectful and mature manner.

Last time us and the server #1 guild formed for Tormax (was really intense
race heh, they started with 14, we had 0.  Then within a minute we had 17 to
their 14, then 17-15, 17-16, 19-16, 22-17, 26-18, 26-20, 26-22, 26-24,
26-26, 28-26, 30-30)

Anyway our raid leader and their raid leader rolled for it (random).. no
gms, no bitching, no problem (was 1/101, they went first and got 89, then
our leader rolled 100 heh)

If you recall my post of the guild who jacked our ST raids, and coh'd over
us in nToV.. well they disbanded recently, and 3/4 joined the guild im
talking about above.. a very appropriate move for them, i guess.

I don't get that you know.. a good friend (in the guild mentioned above that
were having problems with) said they debuff rooted mobs, and he thinks its
fine.. yet me, my guild leader, most my guild infact see this as really
lame.  (which is ironic, if you read "random_prexians" opinion and 'facts'
about my guild)

Your attacking a mob (debuffing, slowing, crippling etc) whilst it cannot
fight back... how is that any different to a pathing exploit? (for example)

Im not sure why they rooted all ntov lords and ladies, but it certainly
wasn't so they can be slowed and debuffed before the fight... i mean why not
just make the mob phsyically 70% slower, and then make him immune to
turgers.  Make him start off with 50 less MR etc...

I know a LOT of guilds do this to rooted mobs, also things like warping
Vyemm to make him killable (with his buggy ass knockback hes a monster
now).. sure if we did the same, mobs would be much easier to kill - but
wheres the challenge in that?
I guess we play more for the challenge than for easy loot (not a knock at
your guild, heck im refering to probably 80%+ guilds)

Heres a quote on our website, from our (now) guild leader -
****
Our arch nemesis Vyemm was attempted again, but things didn't go as planned.
I really despise this encounter now. If you fight him straight up, your
damage output is obscenely low because melee end up out of range to attack
him about 50% of the fight due to the Knockbacks you recieve even though the
AE is resisted 95% of the time.
I know a lot of guilds on other servers like to Warp vyemm into a better
fighting location to kill him. That little unslick cubby on the right side
of his lair would be a damn fine place to kill him at. Melee would always be
in range and Healers can hide from AE which means easy CH rotation. Well, I
call that cheesy and we aren't gonna be doing it.
***
So yeah, we wiped on him that time as a result - but we have killed Vyemm in
the middle of his lair, and its far far far more satisfying than 20
warp/debuff sploit kills of him (imo)

Ya,  I think I'd rank him as the number 1 nToV mob now.. but because even
when you resist his AE, your still hit by it 100% of the time.

Thinking back, whilst we were all c.ring (the time they coh'd over us and we
all wiped because of the lag).. the gm gave us an ultimatum to resolve it,
or his /kill button would... but he had made Aary non-kos whilst it was
settled.  Not sure what he had done.. but Aary conning indifferent wasn't
what we expected to see :)

I guess its the same all over... guilds feel they have to surpress the
opposition like its a war or something.. they HAVE to prevent the other
guild getting into nToV at all costs, but it never happens.  All it does is
makes the other guild more determined, and with a taste for blood in their
mouth.. bitter people and hard feelings

Our number 1 guild are the same, so Im sure guild 2 didn't have too much
trouble getting into nToV (maybe constantly beaten by FCFS for a while, but
eventually they made a rotation)

I guess guild 2 was a little less honourable though, all the usual bullshit
tactics (trains, cohing over our corpses, pulling mobs thru our corpses as
we tried to rez etc).  The last 2 guilds who have moved into nToV though
(neither has cleared it yet I believe) have had it pretty smooth.. I think
Guild2 realised nToV is out of their hands now whatever they do

> Wraith is just hated on our server.

Its more mixed on Prexus... some guilds hate us, some guilds love us.. we
hate some guilds.. other guilds hate other guilds.. etc

I know the feeling :/

I remember a fairly long time ago (pre-nToV days) we had over 50 people
level 60 (like 65 people between lvl58 and 60)

Well I meant for fding agro (rather than dieing and spawning a new mob)

Well on the rare occasion we have non-guilded clerics with us, they get
it... its hard finding non-guild people to take coldain faction hits though
(unless they are raid tryouts).. for the most part here the same as you
guys.
