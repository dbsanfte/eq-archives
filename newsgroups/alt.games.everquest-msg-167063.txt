About monks, they just got put back where they belonged. They messed
up by giving monks too many high AC items starting with Kunark,
turning them into tanks, which was never intended in the first place.
Monks got used to playing this role, then got it yanked out from under
them... AC doesn't "work as well" for monks anymore - 1000 AC does
more for a warrior than 1000 AC does for a monk.
