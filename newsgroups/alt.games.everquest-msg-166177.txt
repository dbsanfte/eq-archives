I think the second worst one was a 20th human necro named "Wheresmycat
Helpmefind" I only saw him one time. I guess he didnt go on to have a
glorious future on my server.

The worst was when I was in loio in the early 20s and we saw a shout
from someone named Poopoopoopoo. After several shouts LFG I responded
to the guy that maybe people saw that name as juvenile and didnt want
him or put him on ignore. (you know....the types that shout or OOC
every 5 seconds LFG) He then said it didnt matter and that his kid
could have made the name up. Since I was in a particularly ugly mood
that day I just responded "Your kid makes me pro choice!" He then got
upset at how mean and closed minded people are and logged.

Havent seen him since.
