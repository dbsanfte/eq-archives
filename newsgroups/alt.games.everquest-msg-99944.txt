Speaking of orbs...there is one of those orbs under Kurn's Tower in FOB.
If you do the "sit down right next to a wall" trick, so that you can see
through the KT walls from FOB, you can see it.  I've tried the "camp out
next to a wall and come back on the other side" trick to get to it to
see what happens if you click on it, but have not been able to get that
trick to work.
