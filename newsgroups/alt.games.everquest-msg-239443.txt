You should put them into a different class.

I have a monk and he gets slapped like a drunk monkey after the nerf.
Granted the monk was far more powerful than he should have been but
they swung that pendulum waaaay to the other side.  Nowadays you can't
get a group; other classes do more DPS (pick any) and bards and SK's
can pull as well or better than a monk.  I have a friend with a monk
as well (nicely outfitted too) and he can only get a group if there
are no other available players and they want to have a 6 person group.
Otherwise he gets passed up for any other class, as do I.
Of course, this does not take into account any of the new skills SOE
just threw out for the monk so maybe it's better.

On a side rant, isn't the berserker what the monk should have been?
Able to deal extreme damage and even crippling attacks that slow or
otherwise affect a mobs ability to attack?  Only able to wear light
armor due to training and need for speed?  I dunno, seems like someone
doesn't like monks anymore.
