As someone who started playing pen & paper D&D way back when the
Player's Handbook and Dungeon Master's guide was still new, it amazes
me how many of the original D&D game concepts have survived virtually
unchanged (even in name) for 25 years and a transition from paper to
computer.   EQ is a particularly notable example of this.  Just a few
that come to mind:

The terms: "Hit Points", "Armor Class", "Experience Points"

Earning XP for slaying monsters.

Money: platinum pieces, gold pieces, silver pieces and copper pieces
(what happened to electrum?)

The concept of character "class" and "level". 
Class names:  Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger, Bard (and 3 others with
slightly more PC names than Fighter, Thief and Magic-User)

The inability for spell-casters to wear armor.

Clerics only being able to use blunt weapons (and no-one else who
theoretically could possibly wanting to).

Earning XP for slaying monsters.

The abilities of STR, INT, WIS, CON/STA, DEX, and CHA and how they
affect a character(ok, EQ added Agility.)

Schools of magic entitled "Evocation", "Alteration", "Abjuration",
"Conjuring", "Divination".

The concept of magic/fire/cold resistance.
...

I'm sure there are many more (feel free to post for nostalgia's sake).
 But here's my question.  Admittedly EQ and other games have added to
this concept (primarily through skill systems) but were Gary Gygax and
the original TSR designers so brilliant that no better system has been
created since (better being determined largely by popularity among
gamers), or are modern game designers just lazy?
