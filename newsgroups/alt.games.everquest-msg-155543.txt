The /report is supposed to log the text currently visible in your chat
window.  So scroll back and center the incriminating text before using
/report, and then refer to the /report in your petition (nobody's gonna
read the reported text if you don't ask them to via /petition).  /report
takes a parameter which is used to identify the particular report, it's
usually easiest to use the nimrod's name in a case like this:

[scroll so that nimrod's self-incrimination is centered in window]
/report a_nimrod00
/petition a_nimrod00 has been deliberately KSing the npcs i'm fighting,
please check my /report a_nimrod00

Or something like that.  Remember to make your petition courteous and
clearly understandable, easier to get a good reaction from GM that way.
