    Not correct. An unengaged mob has mana and health regen that are large,
but it is not infinite nor is it so large that they can cast at will without
losing mana. One of the tricks we used to pull with unstunnable priest mobs
was to move a lesser mob nearby, and drain out the priest's mana as it tries
to keep the lesser mob healed. You can tell when they get low on mana
because they start casting lesser healing spells. And if you want to observe
the health thing, get a really wounded Burynai in the basement in Kurn's and
keep him low on life while the necromancer Burynai try to keep him alive
with life transfer.
