Hello,

I just started playing on Tallon Zek last week, I started a Human Warrior
and have so far done extremely well with as far as my success with leveling,
acquiring attire and completing quests.

However, I am curious as to whether or not I should go with a hybrid
character for a PVP environment.  I've been looking at switching over to a
Ranger or Paladin as I feel the added use of spells + melee would serve me
better in a world where everyone is fair game.

I'm also looking at it from a roleplay standpoint, for I am also wanting to
become a master tailor and eventually a smith, which is something that I
dont' see a Warrior being (a master tailor). :)

Thank You,
John
