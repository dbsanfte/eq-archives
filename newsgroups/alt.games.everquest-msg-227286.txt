Yes because your main weapon is 31 delay hence you get eaten alive by
ripostes.  Had you been using a Windblade - also 44 delay - the damage
taken would have been almost identical and your DPS would have been
higher than the Shadowflame.

I had a WMBS for a bit (31/28) and gave it away because the only time
I got it out was for tanking and it did considerably worse than my
dusty, crusty Primal Battle Axe in the 'reducing damage' area.
Windblade does slightly less DPS than WMBS usually (close though) but
in return you save yourself a bunch if riposte damage.

Nowadays I just dual wield versus anything that needs tanking and let
the healers deal with keeping me alive - admittedly this is easier
since I finished my +HP AAs - can almost pass for a tank these days.
