Nope. Bard charm works for 3 ticks, period. You can't renew the charm until
*after* it wears off -- at which time, of course, you have both the very
angry ex-pet as well as pet's original punching dummy looking to stomp you
flat. Bard charming is best done from a distance, and at high travelocity.

You can find some bard strategy tips for charming at <http://www.eqdiva.com>.
Of course, they have lots of other useful tips there too :)
