Kurns Tower in the Field of Bone (kunark) is exremly good for your level.  I
don't know what you money situation is but you can get backs full of stacks
of bone chips that sell in the bazaar from 5-10pp a stack.  As a Barb. just
load up on supplies and spend a day there.  Dunno what server your on but if
its Kane Bayle I'd be glad to show you around the place.


For the maps question.  I know you have spent / are spending money on EQ but
look into buying the EQ Atlas.  The maps are beautiful and it really pays to
have them at your finger tips while playing.  IMO at $20 it is very much
worth it.  Yes the stuff can be downloaded  but like i said, to have them
all bound in one tome is well worth 20 bucks.
