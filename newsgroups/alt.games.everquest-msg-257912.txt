Demonstrably not, since I camped with quite a few buffs on and with rez 
effects worn off, yet logged back in with rez effects on and Zero buffs.

Since I had all my gear, I suspect that it was looting myself that 
triggered my last save.

As I said above, methods of forcing a save other than zoning are, in my 
experience, only sometimes successful, and I'm unable to predict which 
will work and which won't.  I usually go for the zone thing if its going 
to matter.

It is also slightly possible that the game locked out with me 25+ 
seconds into camping, and I only -thought- I successfully camped; it 
looked like I did, but several people reported there was very little 
warning on some servers, perhaps there was none at all on Luclin and I 
just got "lucky" and was camping while they took them down.  Since I 
watched the timer on camp run down normally and then logout happen, that 
only gives this cooincedence a 5 second window, which seems highly unlikely.
