Did you not read the bit where I said "still has problems"? OK, you
found a problem, woopee. There's another one, funnily enough, in
Beholder's Maze. Like I said. It STILL HAS PROBLEMS, but it
is a lot BETTER than it was because they have been fixing bugs.

Again, you are reading what you want to read. The link you sent was the
announcement that the new CS system came on line in May. 18 months
ago > May.

Again, you are reading what you want to read. To make it simpler,
they said, effectively "we're going to change a lot of stuff across the
board,
but in the meantime, here's what we can do for high end raiders". Until
you have actually heard what they are planning for the ordinary player,
you can't make a judgement like "they missed the mark" because you
are not in possession of all the facts. IF they get a few months or whatever
down the line and they have not provided anything for non-highend raiders
then by all means, they will have missed the mark. But until that point
it is vastly premature to suggest they are not catering to members of non-
highend raiding guilds. Lets wait and hear the rest of their message
before we judge that, eh? Jeez...
