I'm considering remaking my Warrior alt as a follower of Rallos Zek,
and I'm wondering if there's a handy reference out there that tells
you where a "good" race char of that "religion" might be unpleasantly
surprised by the reactions of the locals.  I know about the Dwarves
in BBM, wondering if there're any other lowbie zones or cities where
he'd be likely to encounter the same sort of hospitality.
