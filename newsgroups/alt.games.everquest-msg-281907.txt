It's entirely reasonable to suppose that someone could level from 1 to
70 without ever hearing of Vox, let alone knowing her and her buddy's

never set foot on Antonica, even. Maybe even Norrath!

Easy to click the wrong one in the Tranq hall of stones, the first few
times.

hadn't played in PoP much? Who sells - or buys - a level 55 chanter?
