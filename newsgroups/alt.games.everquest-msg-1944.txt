My guild hasn't been to Hate since the changes.  We are wary about a rumor
we heard, that there are some new faction hits in hate that can kill faction
in Neriak.  Our guild is comprised mostly of Evil races/classes, who are KoS
almost everywhere except Neriak.  Has anyone been to the New Hate and
noticed any unusual faction hits?  Are we now alienated from getting our
Clerics EM gear, because we can't rick going KoS in our home city.  Or is it
just an unfounded rumor?
