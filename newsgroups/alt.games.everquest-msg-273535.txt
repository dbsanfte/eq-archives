Just was in MM when they shut the servers down(no comments on this :p)
,mobs were blue to red  for me,level 67,on track,and the trains were
like in the good old days. :)
There was a (mini)-raid,about 20 people,saw them wiping twice,they
didnt make it past the graveyard,a bunch of red to 67 mobs there.
Judging from the few mobs  I managed to kill there with a 61 Shaman
friend,xp is like PoV,with mobs hitting for around 500,but somewhat
slower than Golems in PoV.
Pathing is terrible,unless you have the zone for yourself I would stay
out.
