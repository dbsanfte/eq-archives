I believe a lot of people understand the benefits of food and drink -
but quit shopping for it.  Between the holidy foods/drinks (which are
really good for the price, even with the 30min duration and only T3-T4
regen rates) and the insane prices people are charging (T2 drinks for
5s and T4 for 17s as of the last weekend in 2004) people just quit
looking for them on brokers.  I found that selling T3 stuff for 1s25c
(and still making an insane profit) tends to go pretty fast.
