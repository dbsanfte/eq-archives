  I just made it up, like the first poster who
started this thread.  An amazing coincidence,
no?   :-)



> Even if it is true, so what?


  So... Albert was not a super genius in
that he made stupid errors in his own
field of expertise?  So.. Einstein was
inept, just as the poster claimed?  :-)

  Did you even bother to read the original
post?  It was claimed that Einstein stole
every one of the ideas in his published
papers, and in each case he gave the alleged
true originator of the idea/research.  Not one
person has yet attempted to address these
claims with substantive evidence, here.   Kind
of strange, I think.

  This was claimed to have been stolen too.
Is anybody actually _reading_ the posts they
are so quick to ridicule?  It looks like they
aren't.  Dumb and dumber.
