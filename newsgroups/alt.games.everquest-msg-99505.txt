I've been wanting to go to Velious ever since I'd heard about it back at
level 10 or so. Last night I finally made it. After dinging 29 I prudly
ported into NRO (I'm a wizard), and walked over to "Frankel the Pirate".
After hailing him, he said that no boats were coming or going. (I suspect
the boats are broken, if anyone has any info, please feel free to share).

So, I ported to Greater Faydark and waited for the luclin portal.  From the
Nexus I went to the Velious porter, and arrived at the spires in The Great
Divide shortly thereafter.  My friend Malanar, a level 31 Necromancer, was
waiting for me at the spires, and led me to Thurgadin, where he told me to
bind.  Then we were off to Tizmak camp 1. MAN was it sweet. The XP was
better than  Mountian Giants, and the whole atmosphere was just more "fun"
(snow is my favorite setting in *any* game).  Plus, there was a wizard in my
group who had a 60 Enchanter alt, and as a result was very rich.  He bought
some summoned focus items for the necro and I and we were tearing the camp
apart.  Using my new snare was very cool, and looting the velium items was
very nice, because as a newbie I would *always* see them, and wonder where
they came from and how "high level" they must be, LOL.

Anyways, I made about 4 blues of EXP, bought a some SoW potions from a
wandering Shaman, and died a few times (had to pay for a rez but it was
worth it).

Also, a buddy of mine from Frontier mountains joined us later on upon my
urging. He liked it to. Velious rocks!

Thurgadin was pretty cool too. But I have one question: The lore says that
the Ice Dwarves were sailing our from Kaladim, and went off course, landing
on Velious.  Until now, they didn't know the way home, and thus couldn't go.
Now, there are boats and ports coming and going from the Old World. Why
don't the Ice Dwarves go back home to Kaladim now that they can?
