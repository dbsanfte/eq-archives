I have Rogueboy, level 65, equipped, on Tarew Marr.  I want to be on E'Ci.

I create Rogueboy, level 1, naked, on E'Ci.

I move Rogueboy v. 1.0 to Stormhammer and delete Rogueboy v. 2.0 on the same
day.

Then I ask to move Rogueboy v. 1.0 "back" to E'Ci and hope the GMs don't
look too closely.

Never done it, but I can name 30+ people that have appeared on Rodcet Nife
through exactly that method.
