Really?  I recall many a battle with Thistle being made near trivial
by his love for his DS, just keep dispelling it and he'd waste time
recasting it.  Pretty sure the Drachnids in DL would recast their DS
occasionally, tho they and the Brownie Outcasts weren't near as
religious about it as that pesty Thistle.
