I am hardly a puller and so far I never had a reason to go beyond the double
doors so  I take your word for it :)
Anyway, it was kinda fun .

On the other hand, don't you just love that you can pull a avocet from the
highest point in the SK bird city and it would just jump down to you ? :) I
am glad they dont take the ramp on their wai down ... hehe
