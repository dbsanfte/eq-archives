I love the game, everyone i have introduced to the game loves it

Buy it, play it (give it a chance, don't expect God status straight away)
and then if ya dont like it after a month you can cancel. It does take a lot
of playing to achieve high levels and the higher end of the game involving
large encounters does take a lot of playtime. eg. We raid Temple of Veeshan
or oen of the alter Planes (Hate, Air, Fear), 4 groups of 6 people (maybe
mroe ro less) and spend anything up to 6 hours doing it.

But there is also plenty of scope for the casual gamer to log in play around
and then log out.
