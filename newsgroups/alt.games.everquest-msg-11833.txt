	At 30, you shouldn't need excessive healing.  Rangers can tank as well as
Warriors up to level 40.

	At L40 you'll start to notice you're getting beat on a bit.  By L45 the
problem is critical; you can mitigate it somewhat if you can get your hands on
planar-equivalent armor.  It doesn't really get better until you hit L51 and
get Jolt.  At that point your biggest problem is learning when NOT to evade
onto the casters.
