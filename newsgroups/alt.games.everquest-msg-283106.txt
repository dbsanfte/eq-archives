I live in a somewhat rural area where septic is the standard rather
than city sewer.  Reading up on how to keep a healthy septic system I
read that brewers yeast was the most common ingredient in most
treatments and that you could just use that directly.

I thought "where does one find brewers yeast around here?  It's pretty
common in PoK."
