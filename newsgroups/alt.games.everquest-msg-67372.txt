  Right, but in the first function, casters have a pretty big
convenience over melee classes.  They have to run less to do corpse
retrievals, in addition to never having to stick around in a city zone
waiting/begging for a bind.  They never have to pay for one either,
after they pay for the spell itelf.  Plus they get all the "tactical"
benefits of bind to boot.

  Having to run through the Qeynos catacombs naked everytime you die
in Blackburrow would be kind of annoying, but I suppose you're right.
