MA keeping aggro is the key. At start of fight MA calls he is engaging in
5,4,3,2,1. At 3, patch healers start to heal (druids, shamans etc.) MA
engages and chanter casts aggro + on MA. Meanwhile the CHC will start come
into place so patch heals can stop but be ready to watch for cleric to call
a patch because a CH has fizzled. Chanter casts aggro - on him self and
tashes mob. When cycled cast aggro + back on MA.

When the MA believes he has sufficient aggro he calls assist. Other melees
pile in. Rogues at the back other melees on the side, this tops mob being
pushed around.

When mob gets to around 70% health we call for casters to nuke, steady
nuking is required, overnuking leads to aggro being lost on MA. Continue
until mob is dead.

While this is happening mages would provide rods for clerics/wizards and
shaman would torpor those rodding. This is will change a little with the new
mod rod rules but still valid. With the mod rod rules coming soon Necros
will again be important as mana batteries for the chc, which is a shame as
they do v nice dmg to mobs.

If you are fighting a mob that rampages then send in SA a little bit after
MA for him to gain aggro so that he is target for Rampage and not a caster.
