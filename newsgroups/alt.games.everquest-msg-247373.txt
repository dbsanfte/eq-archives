   Anyone here know how send the message to create a new newsgroup?  And if
yes, feel like doing so?

    Actually, you got a blank tell from "Tealeaf".  That was what I tried
to name my first serious EQ character, a Barb Shaman, but had to settle for
"Tealeef".  I was delighted that I could actually get the correct spelling
in CoH.  In fact, I made Tealeaf's on all the servers of CoH.  I don't know
if it was really ethical for me to lock down the name completely like that,
but selfish as I tend to be I really like the idea of being the One and
Only Tealeaf, period.   Right now actively playing on the Protector and
Virtue servers.

   So if you added "Teapray" to your friends list, you might want to change
that.  If you added "Tealeaf" you might also want to update this... I
deleted the original and recreated here.  I'm still a magic Defender with
the Empathy and Radiation skills, but I like my new look much more.  The
pic came out a bit muted once I compensated for an overly dark screenie, 
but you can get an idea of what I look like at
http://webpages.charter.net/lenny13/tealeaf.JPG .  

   I think I've learned the interface a bit better since I was sending you
blank tells and the ever useful tell of "test" (Thanks for saying I
passed... I clearly was struggling with the material).  Remapping the reply
key to "r" like you suggested was a big help.
