Phen-fen was the miracle diet combination of two drugs that caused very
serious heart damage.  Yes, I know, this is a serious response to your
joking comment.

The FDA unfortunately is being hammered to get drugs through faster, not
just by the drug companies that want to sell them and make money, but also
by potential patients, particularly when the drugs are for life threatening
diseases such as cancer, and AIDS.  They have to attempt to play a balancing
act whereby the drugs are reasonably tested before being allowed to be sold,
yet are not held up too long, particularly if they may be efficacious in
helping people who are certain to die without some means of treatment.  I'm
sure there are many problems with the process, but there are a lot of
conflicting issues that have to be balanced.
