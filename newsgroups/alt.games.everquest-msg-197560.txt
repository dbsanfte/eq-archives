Along with the other advice youve been given, check out the Stein of
Moggok, its got nice stats (10 int among others) and is a great light
source (the light healing effect is just about useless however). Heres
a link to it: http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=2332 .
Should be pretty cheap on your server (unless you started on Stromm -
im sure the economy there is quite different there compared to others
since its a new server). Just be sure to hold it in your hand (either
one) to get the stats and light source. A cheaper lightsource would be
a lightstone or a greater lightstone. You could even camp wisps to get
one (they are common in eruds crossing, Qeynos hills, North Karana and
East Commonlands).
