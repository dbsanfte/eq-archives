    Running the wall to a camp-out spot = assured deaths.  Doing the
stolen/secret deck system we use there are NO deaths.  Uh... how exactly do
you define fewer?  The ratio can be anything from 20% or higher by running
the wall.  Verses ZERO on the zone break-in.

    Again.  If you do a zone break-in vs. running the wall, you will take
fewer casulties.

    Uh... again, here Dav.  There is no wipe out.  No "...unless...".  And
no, I am not comparing the stolen/secret deck system to a wipeout.  I am
comparing it to running the wall.  You stand-and-fight at the port-in point
and don't run.  When done correctly, no one dies.
    What's the chances of a successful zone break-in utilizing the
stolen/secret deck system?  (The measure of the success being either wipeout
or survive).  If my guild is running it with no invites: 100%.  That chance
is based on the last 5 times we have done it.

    Heh, ok Dav (and Darren who responded) port up to Hate and stand there.
Do nothing.  You'll die when a roamer comes around the corner.

    When I say true, it's not in my world.  It's abject truth.  And again,
"...there are no roaming mobs at the entrance to the zone..." is what I am
saying is not true.
