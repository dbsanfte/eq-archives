Well, it triggered the "Player is under the world at <x>, <y>, <negative
lots>, moving to safe point" message, as usual... then it dropped me for
large amounts of damage (not lots, but more than I had, as a boat-taking
lowbie wizard) and a "LOADING, PLEASE WAIT".

Luckily I still had a petition in the queue from a previous problem (an
hour or so earlier), so I got a fairly prompt tell...

A_Guide_00 tells you "Hail friend, are you still in need of assistance?"
You tell A_Guide_00 "Well, actually I sorted that one out, but I just
died from falling under the world. My corpse is probably at the safe
point in Butcherblock."
A_Guide_00 tells you "Yes, yes it is. Please standby for a CS rez."

Best CS response I've ever had, even if it was due to a mixup.

Cheers,
