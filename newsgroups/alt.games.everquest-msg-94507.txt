It's a really long run and dangerous at your level.  That's why teleport was
recommended.  If you want to adventure a little take the boat to
Butcherblock and hang out in BB and G Fay for a while.  Can understand
wanting to move around.  At third level I went from Qeynos to Rivervale, my
objective was Freeport, but I stopped in RV for a while.  I had help getting
there, there is no way I could have made that trip on my own.
