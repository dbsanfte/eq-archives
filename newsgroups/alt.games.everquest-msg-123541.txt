Hi all.  I recently acquired a second account and am busy PL'ing my
new enchanter with my 52 Ranger.  For the first 10 lvls or so, I
mostly DS'd the chanter, tossed on Force of Nature (a small regen
spell) and healed as needed.  The mobs pretty much beat themselves to
death on the DS.

I knew I could also use mez to erase the hate list, and let my chanter
get the kill. However, even with tash, mez only stuck on mobs that
were yellow or lower to my chanter.

Now at lvl 12, I'm very happy to find that Mem Blurr works well even
on mobs that are up to 6 levels above me.  Currently I'm hunting in
SolA.  I beat the mob down to a sliver of health with my ranger, tash,
mem blurr, and 2/3 of the time, the chanter can get the killing hit
and get full exp.

However, I am reading on these message boards about how broken Mem
blurr and its line of spells are, and how unreliably they clear the
hate list.

Will the mem-blurring ablity of my chanter decrease as she goes up in
level?  Will mobs become more resistant to it?  Would casting MB
multiple times improve my chances of erasing the hate list?  Would mez
be a better option?

Thank you for any info.  This ability to mem-blur is what convinced me
to give up on PL'ing a shaman in favor of the PL-friendly enchanter
(not to mention a ranger with c2 or KEI and a good haste buff is a
force to be recconed with).

Additionaly, if anyone has any suggestions about how to better PL my
enchanter, I'd be happy to hear them.
