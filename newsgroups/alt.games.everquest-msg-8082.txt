My favourite method of bind wounds increase (as well as taunt,
defence, slam etc.) is to attack a Freeport guard before zoning,
battling until I am around 1 bubble of health then fleeing to zone.
Bind wounds on the other side, then head on my way. I could ping pong
back and forth, but it's more fun to just jump one when I'm headed to
the boat or bank, from 50% I am usually in fighting condition again
before I reach a dungeon.
