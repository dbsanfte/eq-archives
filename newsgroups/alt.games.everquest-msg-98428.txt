Planning is planning. Start with a good plan and what follows is also
good. Jump in with both feet and then realize you can't swim, is not a
good way to run anything. It simply seems as if there is no control over
what is rolled out in these patches. Not actual real life threatening,
but I for one would be very embarrassed to be responsible for this
patch? There are tried and true methods for modifying code in any
programming situation. Here it looks as if it wasn't implemented.....
Foe those of us, new to EQ like me, but not new to code writing it is
very frustrating. What I really don't understand is why so many take any
criticism of poor code writing as if it was a dagger aimed straight at
their hearts. Any improvement in Verant's management of these patch
rollouts can only be a boon to us all in the form of a more stable and
enjoyable game.
