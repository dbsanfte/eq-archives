Hopefully that's true. If so, it will help a lot. But these people
that say "If you kill someone, their guild will be mad at you, and you
might get kicked out of a guild, blah blah blah", that's all total
crap. They tried that with the DAOC PvP servers. Being in a guild
didn't matter a damn. Even if it protected you from other guilds (it
didn't, but let's pretend), the non-guilded would kill you all the
time.

If they track who's killing who, and a guy has a "reputation" of some
kind, that will help. But relying on "the guilds will sort it out" is
crap.
