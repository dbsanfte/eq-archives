I know that you didn't say it but it might be inferred that the pet is
the Necro's best source of DPS.  This is only kinda true in that it is
mana-free, sustained DPS.  But in almost any case the DOTs you put on
the mob are going to out-damage the pet.  A 70 necro pet will do maybe
70 or 80 DPS, tops?  (Just ballpark, +/- 25% guessing since the last
time I parsed one was at 65.)  Meanwhile _just_one_single_DOT_ at the
same level will do 100 DPS.  Expect that same necro to have another DOT
or two on any given mob.

Hands down the best DOTs in the game.  Not only do they do more damage
than other class' DOTs, Necros also get more options in their DOTs,
some lasting 2 minutes or more, some lasting 30 seconds and doing
massive damage in that time period.

I would very much disagree with this.  You need to tap back the life
you are giving to the other player and this costs a lot of mana.  You
need to have your lich up if you want to keep up.

You can often only keep one mezzed and it is physically impossible to
keep more than 2 mezzed.  The recast is long enough that by the time
you cast it two more times, the first mob is free and beating on you.
And since they also resist a lot of the time, even keeping 2 of them
mezzed can be a handful.

(Dot it at least once before you sick the pet--otherwise the pet gets
agro.  Oh and don't forget to turn pet taunt off)

This may still be true to an extent but these days, Necros are far more
welcome in groups than they used to be.  Also, solo experience at high
levels isn't quite what it used to be.  (Can't speak about soloing in
Fire, as my Necro isn't flagged, but soloing in unflagged zones after
around 67 really starts to suck)  You get penalized a lot more these
days for not grouping, and because everything and it's aunt summons,
grouping is often the best way for most of us to get nice gear drops or
farm for plat.

A few things you didn't mention which might want to go in to a FAQ
about necros:

-Tap tanking.
-Undead slows.
-Mana taps (so very welcome once necros get these).
-Necro being backup for when the cleric dies (necro feigns and then
rezzes cleric).
-Twitching.
