Several reasons  come to mind:

1) faction; often twinks are on a radically different faction than mains, and
shopping for them can be tricky

2) charisma; mid level characters twinking low level characters might not have
the charisma to buy cheaply... at high end pretty much everyone has 106
charisma on demand.

3) No drop purchasables: some items can be bought only by the user

4) Consumables: with cash your twink can buy more of whatever he's going thru
(malachite, food and drink, whatever) as needed, otherwise you have to keep
getting both characters together to pass more stuff.

5) Want to explore with the twink: give him cash and let him do the shopping
while you get used to him

6) Twink can learn skills while shopping: chain cast till OOM, then shop.
Sense heading on autokey while shopping.  Bard song left running while shopping
(careful what song you leave on of course).  Several other skills can be
improved during skill up.

7) Skill ups: for higher level twinks, actual cash gets dumped into raising
skills, if you haven't kept them up.  And who is more likely to have NOT kept
all skills capped off than a twink?

8) For KEI, BOA, ports... you get better results with flattery, and as we know,
cash is the sincerest form of flattery.

9) Cash quests: Lashun Novashine, Hasten, and teh little lady in Rivervale
who's name escapes me, at least, all need cash on the barrelhead for their
services.

10) I can't think of a tenth reason but there are doubtless more.
