In reading up on Ethereal Mist armor, something struck me as odd.  Why do
the boots and greaves have INT?  What benefit do clerics get from having a
high INT?  As far as I've read, we get nothing since our wisdom will always
be higher.  So why would anyone -- but an insane and/or uneducated armor
enchanter -- add INT to cleric-only armor?

As for the Ethereal Mist armor, I'd definitely like to get the chestplate,
greaves, helm, and bracers.  Not sure about the vambracers or boots.  And
I'll definitely not trade my Gauntlets of the Black for Ethereal Mist
Greaves.  However, overall, definitely a place I'd like to visit.

How big of a raiding party do you need to go there for these items?  I'm
joining a small guild (30-40 members) soon and wondering if they can take
it.  If they can't, how easy is it for a 41st level cleric to join another
guild's raid?  Are there such things as pick-up raids?  Is there anywhere I
can park myself and advertise my desire to join such a raid?  Never done a
plane raid before.  In fact, I have only done one weak raid that was
basically a disaster.
