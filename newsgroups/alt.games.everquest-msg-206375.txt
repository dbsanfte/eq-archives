Im not sure what level you can start, but soloing at 49 with an enchanter is
easy. Slow mob, haste pet, dot mob, cast the occasional bezerker spirit on
pet.
Some places the pathing isnt so great for the monster either, and you can
fear it on half health (without snare).
Charming might work. The xp sucks at high levels, so be warned. Actually any
soloing sucks now, with the exception of quadding or planes. Either you play
the game they want you to play it, or you pay the price.
