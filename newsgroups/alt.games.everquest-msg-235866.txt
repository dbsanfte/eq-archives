Warriors only have the provoke line atm. It is a godsend for them to keep
way better aggro. My lvl 53 war could keep aggro over 2 lvl 60+ rangers
(pure melee/nukes, not using jolt) which was unthinkable before.

The provoke line is really usefull, something "taunt" should have done from
the start.
A succesful taunt and then Provoke+ means the mob is glued to the warrior. I
can peel incoming mobs from chanters who use tash and slow on the pull.

The other abilities were supposed to work with the opening system, but due
to lots of complaints on it on the testserver it was pulled out and is
currently under revision. The skills are decent, but the stupid "click in 2
seconds" after an opening presents itself makes for some seriously
stressfull gameplay, not to mention increasing chances on RSI.
