    Doesn't work. One of our enchanters is almost at the point of quitting
because his Dire Charmed pets won't accept weapons, and thus can't be made
to quad. Dire Charm was one of the few fun things he still had playing EQ.
I've grouped with him, and he names all the pets and cheers them on against
whatever he can pull to them. This hurt.

    Or when Bratly on Veeshan gave King Tormax a Sword of Skyfire just
before a rival guild pulled him. Or when someone on my server gave Dain a
pair of Gnoll Hide Lariats. Or....
