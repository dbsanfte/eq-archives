Finding one, (in a locality they can physically survive) is far easier 
than then establishing beyond a shadow of a doubt that there are none to 
be found.

To prove X exists all you need is an example of X
To prove X does not exist you need to inductively prove that 
*everything* that does is exist isn't an X. This is naturally much 
harder to do.

Really, and how many Q&As would I have to search, coming up empty each 
time, would it take to convince you? "All" of them??

"An understanding of what does and doesn't make something illegal"?? 
Um... if it is 'prohibited by law' it is illegal. Nothing complicated 
about that. Breaking contracts isn't prohibited.

They aren't there to prevent contracts from being broken, they are to 
prevent injury when they are broken.

Back where we started. "No that doesn't make it illegal"... "Yes it 
does" ... "No it doesnt"...

Unless your prepared to find a reference, then yes you are wasting our time.
