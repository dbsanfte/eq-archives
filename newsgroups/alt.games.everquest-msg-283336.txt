You know, its just sad that these companies are not even offering their 
illicit wares and services for EQ anymore.

But even odder, that they -are- offering it for EQ2.  I mean, I know I'm 
out of the loop, but I had the impression that EQ2 was a flash in the 
pan, never got quite as big as EQ and rapidly died back out to a pretty 
low level of participation.

This is two PL services now in a row spamming this site who apparantly 
cover EQ2 and not EQ.

I also had the impression that EQ2 was deliberatly designed so as to 
make PLing much more difficult.  Was that a false impression, or did the 
player population figure out ways around that, or did they drop the 
restrictions... or are these guys just willing to grind it out "honestly"?

Now that I no longer have the Berserk Rage come over me when I see these 
spammers, its interesting to examine precisely what they are offering to 
see if what it reveals about the state of MMOG's
