After more carefully looking at the recipe,I found you need 
fruits too,which are also foraged,so a price of 4gp for
making 1 MTP as mentioned by eqplayer is totally unrealistic,
so MTPs are not a good tip to make money...
...and that was my point.

I recommend Shadeling Silk,drops from mobs with 16 hps.  :)
