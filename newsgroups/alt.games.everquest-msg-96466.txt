This hasn't been true since pre-kunark. There's a couple questionable
kunark dungeons (Kaesora, Droga/Nurga) but besides that its clear
sailing.

It's the old world dungeons that are a mess.

So no, I don't buy that excuse at all.

Baloney. You need wellbalanced parties if you're grouping with noobs.
Enchanter/cleric/warrior is a FARCE put forward by those who don't
understand how to make a group work dynamically rather than the "book"
solution to camping.

Dan, I just thought of a second way to tell noobs - they believe in
the holy trinity.

*shrug* Sitting on your ass in OT and DL is one of the major reasons
to get burned out on EQ. Its easy, and its boring, and it has little
or no reward.

Or, more correctly, no one knows how to play their class anymore.
Dungeons *are* harder. They are also *better*.
