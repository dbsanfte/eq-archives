Again, probably through my total lack of communications skills, I failed
to get through to you. You're still thinking of this from your current
position. Sure..... nothing you want *now* could be gotten for
reasonable plat. I bet there was some stuff twelve levels ago that could
though. As to who is willing to sit in EC to /auction, well... I don't
care for it either, but I've done it to raise needed cash for the stuff
you *can* buy for reasonable plat pre-fifty to early fifties. And I
never sat there for weeks. I sell below market value for a still
reasonable chunk of change and day traders snap them up.

Again, try to remember that while you see *yourself* as a second tier
guild (and I'm not saying you guys are on the same rack with the team
that just woke the sleeper) you are still waaaaaaaaay above most of us
with our thirty and forty member guilds in the 45 to 55 range. It really
is a different world, and mandatory passing down of gear *is* an issue.
If you feel you can afford to and want to, fine. But don't tell folks at
that level they *have* to.

Why would I bitch? That's the part I guess I failed to reach you on the
first time. Read back above. I'd bitch because I'm *not* in MoM and I
*didn't* get almost all my gear through my guild as you say below that
you did. And I *don't* have nearly the gear to even keep up with the
majority of players at my level. And the cash *would* make a difference
and let me buy a pair of Lammys, a Fungi, etc. etc. etc.  It's a
different world up there and down here.

Exactly what I've been saying all along. I'm not sure about MoM, but a
bunch of the "second tier" guilds on our sever will take you as low as
fifty, some even at 46. And if that fifty or 46 is your untwinked main,
it's an issue. That's all I'm trying to point out to you. We ain't that
rich, and the money that can be generated from selling our previous gear
can , and does, make a difference in trying to catch up. As to getting
new stuff from the guild, yes, that can and likely will happen in time.
But I'm also sure that you well know that the new kid on the block is
the last one at the uberloot feeding troth in upper level guilds, so
they still have to look out for number one when trying to upgrade.

That single pair of sentences, I think, points out the difference in
perspective between somebody who's already made it and the rest of us
stil trying to make it. You'd get jaws hitting the floor in the halls of
all the guilds containing the 95% of us who haven't made it to your
level if you said that to them. "The thing is that there really isn't
any reason to need plat."  Yeah. Tell that to all the mid-forties. LOL!

Very likely true. If I make it to your level, who knows? I might start
thinking and feeling the same way. But I hope I'll remember this
conversation and not take it for granted and /boggle at some new recruit
who doesn't want to give up his 3Kpp sword when a Lammy drops while he's
still wearing crafted, just because I'm all in quest armor.
