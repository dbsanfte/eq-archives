    So we should completely ignore the solo ability of a class when deciding
who can do what? Being able to solo efficiently for XP is a great ability,
one I dearly wish I had. Sadly, I wasn't around when Manastones dropped and
I don't have the 60 K to purchase one so I could be a good soloer.

    Because everyone in EQ obsesses over max-min, and making the best
possible mix of characters. A druid is not a "max" at anything considered
powerful - second best heals, second best nukes, second best DoTs, second
best ports, second best damage shields, second best HP/AC buffs. They do
have areas where they are best, however - best CR/FR buff, best FR debuff,
best regen buff, best set of "utility" buffs (SoE, wolfform, etc.) So at
most things a caster can do they are either best or second best. That's a
powerful character.

    Druids aren't needed because they don't have something they are best at
that is considered necessary. Because they aren't needed, they aren't wanted
(min-max). The right way to make them wanted, in my opinion, would be to
make them best at something that is needed, rather than make them almost
best at something that is needed. /shrug
