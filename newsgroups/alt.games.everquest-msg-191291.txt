What part of timed event did you not understand?    You can either stop and
deal with one piece of loot, or you can finish the event to get your flags.
You cannot do both.

Roll?

/boggle again.

This is not an epic drop, where the mob only drops one thing, and everyone
knows what it will be.  There is no way of knowing which of the 5? 10? items
on the mob's loot table it will drop.  If all the drops are even known.
Once you do know what dropped, then you have to sort out among the 50 people
there who can use it best, most likely dealing with links of current
equipment, and which player should loot it.

Even in a non timed event, this can occasionally take the entire half hour
loot window.

A longer loot timer would not help.    The loot timer still has to expire
before anyone who was not on the "designated looter" list is allowed to
touch the corpse.

Again, unless you know beforehand exactly what will drop and who will be
getting it, you cannot complete the loot until the timer has expired.

Increasing the timer to 10 minutes would mean the entire raid would have to
stop and twiddle it's thumbs for a minimum of 10 mins every time an item
dropped, even if it got sorted out immediately.
