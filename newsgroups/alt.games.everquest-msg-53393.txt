Which one is the drakkel forged bastard? If its just the 50 spd 20 or 25
damage variety than its worthless. Oh wait, yeah it is that one. Ahahah
even the vendor does not sell it for 400 plat I think.
Its not even worth the 150 plat EQ prices states since people only sell
it to the vendor. If you were in great divide you could probably auction
you wanted to take one off someone's hands for 20 plat and they probably
would say yes.

That guy was mixed up, the drakkel ICE REAVER which is like 40 spd 24
damage and has the nice proc on it is the one that might be worth 400.

You know what makes me sick? On firiona vie where stuff liek that is
still rare I saw a pair of iskar gloves on a vendor in freep for like 165
plat with my barb shaman of level 13. Of course I could not afford that
and it would be silly  to spend that much for them but I sure wish I'd
been on when the person was selling them. My character is in banded and
some ringmail so those gloves would have been quite nice.
