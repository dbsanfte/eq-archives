EQ Companion.   That was what I was using during my parsing craze phase.  I
tried to use YALP, but couldn't figure a dang thing out.

Scroll down towards the bottom of the page and download and run the
installer based on your OS.  Next, download and extract the latest
"executable only" file to your EQ Companion directory.  After that, using it
is pretty straightforward.
