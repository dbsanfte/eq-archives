Oh, I could laugh bitterly about this. I could never raid but was able to
solo in kunark with my monk provided i didn't get ambitious and try to
tackle something a necro would chew through. Then there was a patch, and
that was that. Other monks bought gear up using american dollars. I tried
two boxing, and could then handle vellious and some luclin content, but that
was the beginning of the end. I think EQ2 is a better game because it's
designed to be soloable from the ground up. The attitude from SOE at the
time of the patch was that "we have to do this to stop people with gear
you'll never obtain doing content solo that you will never even see... and
if you don't like it, go play something else!"

I think the number of viable alternatives now forced them to pick up their
game, and it's funny to see this backflip... way too late.
