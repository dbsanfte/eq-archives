Cool :) I think that you'll quite enjoy EQ. I know that I have enjoyed it
immensely! Youve picked an interesting class to start out with. As youve
probably noticed theres no real "templates" really at all, and any
"mistakes" that a person makes creating a character are easily overcomeby
gear later on in the game.

Your Absolutely correct about the pace of EQ being a LOT slower, and more
laid back than the frantic killing spree type of pace that is AC.  That
though can be enjoyable though, especially as it seems more like youve
accomplished somthing taking down a mob that takes more than a few swipes
with a sword or a few arrows to drop :)

What server did you start out on if I may ask ? If you started out on
Torvonillous Id be glad to lend a hand,  not TO much of a hand though.. I
know you want to experience it yourself :)

Have you looked at doing the Newbie quests for your starting towns guild ?
The gear that you can get from them is quite serviceable, and Ive found, it
looks pretty dang nice for the Plate classes :)

In any case enjoy your stay in Norrath, and if I can ever help out let me
know :)
