    That was the solution I proposed ages ago. For an assassinate mission, 
have the boss drop one piece of dungeon-appropriate loot. For a rescue, have 
the target NPC be up and calling for help when the dungeon is entered, and 
have them refuse to move until a certain percentage of the dungeon mobs are 
dead. That would make the risk vs. reward of each type be pretty close.

    The loot doesn't support the risk in the least. Droppables are in the 60 
HP/MANA range, with highly restrictive req. levels and frequently Attunable. 
Compare that with the droppables a level 65+ character can obtain in WoS or 
MPG, or the No Drops that also drop in those zones. The raid-level loot from 
Mistmoore is appropriate, however.

    Paw is a crapfest now. The pathing is as brutal as ever, the drops are 
as pathetic as Mistmoore's, and one mob ability (a spin-stun) is horribly 
broken, landing over and over on people with resists out the butt. Did you 
ever go with us to Xegony, Loral? Did you ever get attacked by the spiders 
near the top? That's what it's like. There is one quest in the zone that's 
worth doing (for a 60 HP/MANA/END augment), but after that you'd never want 
to return.

    I especially like how the mission system features two competing 
factions. Like Velious, you choose who you want to work for.

    One of the things you won't yet be able to comment on is the Barter 
system, as it's still a bit up in the air. Right now, there's a Barter zone 
in addition to the Bazaar zone - they're separate. The people at EQTraders 
are trying to figure out a way to get Tanker (dev in charge of this) to 
merge the two, but he's very worried about zone crashes from an overloaded 
zone. If anyone has any ideas, please go to EQTraders and post them in the 
thread in the general forum - having the ability to both auto-sell and 
auto-purchase in the same zone would be incredible.
