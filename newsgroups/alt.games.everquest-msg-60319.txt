This happened to us! The guy with us said it was an "officer" so he had to.  I
thought it was incredibly tacky.  But it also put the Fear of Guilds in me. 
Being expected to drop out of a group on an "officer's" whim?  It wasn't even a
corpse run.  
And it made a negative impression of the guild in general.
