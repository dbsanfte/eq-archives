All the combats ended up with pretty even damage spread over Me, the 
other Ranger, Bard and Sometimes the Cleric.

The Monk seemed to be doing okay in not getting hit as did the Wizard. 
Except in the multiple pulls.

Humm! As most of the NPC's have very similar names. I cannot really say. 
I have looked at my log. In the one case where I was hitting a mob with 
a more original title. It decided to have a go at both the Bard and 
Cleric. But in this case not the other ranger, As he had already gone 
Linkdead and didn't return.

That happened in the multiple pulls. One would peel off and try to get 
the wizard or cleric.

The monk was quite good at trying to round up strays. Thought the wizard 
did get to work on his melee skills on a couple of occasions.

Hehe! Wizards in Lower Guk have roasted me on a couple of occasions now. 
When soloing I stay clear of them and only deliberately go after one if 
it's absolutely necessary. But they do wander in on fights every now and 
then. Finding that wizards have a root spell was a rather fatal shock 
<grin>

Thanks for your time and trouble :)
