Well put, Ed.

Because most religions aren't about studying anything since the term
implies a willingness to question.

Because positive feedback loops never work, either in my line of work
or real life.

Because 'Bible Study' is an oxymoron, at least the way people use the
term down here in the Bible belt (South Carolina). Unless there's a
willingness to question basic assumptions, I don't think you can
'study' anything. 

I'm obviously stereotyping above, but those stereotypes are there for
a reason.
