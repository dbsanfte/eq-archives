    It is. At upper levels, a good mob to practice this on is any sort of
greater kobold shaman in Sol B. They don't hit too hard, their spells aren't
of the "sooner than instant death" variety like frog wizards in Lower Guk,
they try to slow you often (and fail often), and are spaced out enough that
you have a fair amount of time to kill one when it runs before you get adds.
Of course then you spend ten minutes sitting to heal up from the damage
during the fight....
