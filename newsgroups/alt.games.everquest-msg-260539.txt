When I am four-boxing, I run three of the characters on one machine.

I have made two copies of the Everquest directory, so I can keep the
settings of each account. Running the main account in full screen with all
the blips, beeps and ugly luclin models on. On the two other accounts I have
turned off all sounds, sparklies, skies and luclin models (except the ones I
need to use mounts), and turned down clip plane to its lowest.
I have the Max FPS setting at I think 25 on all three accounts.
You also need to login one account at a time, since you can only have one
instance of the patcher running at once.

This runs very smooth on my 3200+ AMD machine with 1GB RAM, switching
between windows is instant.
Tanking/pulling with the main character, then Alt-TAB for a quick heal,
Alt-TAB-TAB to third window for some wizzy loving, then Alt-TAB-TAB back to
the main full screen window.

The enchanter as the fourth box has its own machine, since that's the
critical job when I mess up pulls or get swarmed somehow.
I love four-boxing, I am not antisocial or anything (in my own opinion) but
I love being able to do my own ldons, groups and have a "raidforce" ready
for easier stuff like epic fights.
"We" usually hit BoT or LDoNs for exp, unfortunately the twinkiest of the
twink characters is not yet flagged anywhere, have only been focusing on
getting him exp.
