I've read quite a few posts in the last 24 hours saying basically "My
raiding party had just taken down UberMob_xxx and it dropped all the great
phat lewts for the first time in history, but then the server went down and
we all died and nobody got rez and the next big MOB was right there and now
somebody else got him, yada yada yada..." followed by a major bashing of
SOE, Verant, the programmers, other guilds, their own guild, Microsoft, Best
Buy, Bill Clinton, the CIA, etc. etc. etc.

A simple question. Why do an important raid on a patch day?

We KNOW the patch will take longer than scheduled.
We KNOW there will be unexpected problems when the patch goes live.
We KNOW there will likely be server crashes.
We KNOW there will almost certainly be emergency follow-up patches, possibly
several.
WHY do anything that might put hard-earned loot or exp in jeopardy for the
48 or so hours we *know* the game will be unstable?

Before you hit reply, I already know that yes, you pay your $12.95 and that
should get you uninterrupted service 24/7/365. However, that just ain't how
it works in the real world. In the real world, crap happens. I *should* be
able to rely on cars stopping at the red light while I cross the street, but
guess what? I still look both ways. Yes, it shouldn't be that way, but all
the bitching in the world won't make it any different.

Think of patch day as a crossroads in the game. Use caution while crossing,
and you don't get hit.  If you chose to put your character in a risky
situation on patch day and got burned, you must accept responsibility for
your decision.

I spent my post-patch time piddling around with a level 4 Ranger alt I'd
created some time ago but not played much.
