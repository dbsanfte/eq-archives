Argh. Are you even reading what I'm writing, or am I being that unclear? Yes, I would
agree that Virginia's murder rate is very low when compared to DC's. I would not agree
that Virginia's murder rate is extremely low (see, there's no comparison to DC made in
this sentence). And when did we switch from murder statistics to rape statistics that I
haven't seen? I was willing to ignore the switch from violent crime in general to murder
in particular, but now we're continuing to go off base.

I didn't say that I expected more current data. I'm sure it's out there somewhere, but I
haven't had time to fetch it, myself. What I said was that I would be curious to see
them, since a new ingredient has been added to the mix that wasn't much of a factor
before.
