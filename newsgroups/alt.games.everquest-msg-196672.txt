I think the CoF (haha, don't get all confused you eq junkies) is an
excellent idea, although I am and have been an avid CSer for ... well, a
long itme -- 3 or 4 years.

The spawn timer was put in to help cut down on zerging during battles IIRC.
I think its a pretty good idea.  What I *really* like is:

a) friendly fire is on including splash damage
b) the grief system in place to combat FF

A is self explanatory, for those curious about B, when you hit friendlies,
you're notified of how much damage you've done to them.  As you incur your
friendly fire points, your guns will start to jam, and you will have other
equipment failures.  Over time your FF points will gradually drop down... if
you rack up a ton of grief points currently the idea is a ban on your
account for a couple of days.

kudos to that.
