Yes, my mana, buffs and time are more important than that of 
people who are dumb enough to fight on the tracks.  Period.
You'll note I never said I dragged trains over people haphazardly,
in fact I take pains to avoid them, until it's impossible.

I can count the number of times I've trained out of a zone
in the past month on the fingers of one hand - Twice in 
Dulak with my cleric who I had to run deep into the zone to
drag 2 bodies out.  No one around the zone-in responded when
I asked if I could get an invis, so I simply told the zone
I was retrieving bodies, and there was a good possiblity
of a train to the zone.  Twice I got chased by a see invis
spider in PoV while I was going from camp to camp looking
for a group - That's even easier, since the majority of 
people are in fixed camps, they're easy to avoid, and I can
come into the ZO from the opposite side of where people 
zone in.  2 nights ago I had to leave a group in PoN that was 
PL'ing a 'chanter bot on our other account, and I had to take a
train to the Hedge instead of gating to WW by ToV where I'm 
bound.  Again - I stayed away from the wall and any camps
on the way to the hedge.  So, who would have been affected
in these trains?  ONLY PEOPLE DUMB ENOUGH TO STAY ON THE
FUCKING TRACKS.
