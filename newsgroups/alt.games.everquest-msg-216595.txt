Nothing really.  Originally you asked about a Cleric/Warrior or
Cleric/Shadow Knight combo.  Then you indicated your friend was
contemplating deleting their character.  All I was pointing out was if
someone was TRULLY tired of the game then deleting their character can be
the best thing to do.  When the fun factor is gone then deleting in my
opinion is the best thing.  Otherwise you will eventually forget all of the
reasons you quit and then come back thinking it will somehow be a better
experience.  Insanity is coming back to the same thing and doing the same
thing expecting a different outcome.

And the point I was refering to about SOE screwing veteran players was with
the release of Evolutions.  Many of us have been with EQ since the early
days and it was a slap in our face to give the whole farm away in one
package that is cheaper than the LOY oriiginally sold for.  Maybe I am
pissed about how let down I was about SWG.  But that is another issue.

So continue on in your jouneys in Norath.  I was only pointing out that if a
character sucks to play and you no longer find an enjoyment in playing it
then deletion is a viable option.

Now for a flame:  You only a 46 pissing baby cleric?  Dam, come back when
you grow up.

Hehe.
