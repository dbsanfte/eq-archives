OK KIDS HERE WE GO

        You may not know this, But EQ has more Cybersex going on then
anywhere on the planet. Yes I said Cybersex.
        Have you ever seen two Toons sitting very close face to face, they
are sending tell's back and forth.
        Yes the gay commutity has invaded EQ, well it is a Fantasy
Roleplaying Game.
        How many roleplayer's are playing with there role, I don't know,
don't ask, don't tell.
        Have you ever asked a Toon of the oppsite sex if they are the same
in RL, don't bother there lyin.
        I just play the game, I don't ask about RL and I am never
disapointed.


Good Hunting
