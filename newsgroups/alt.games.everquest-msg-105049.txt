I play a Vah Shir beastlord and have run into a "hell" level. 14. Most
things in Shadeweaver's Thicket now con light blue, or red and yellow.
In Hollowshade Moor, things that con light blue and dark blue, certainly
not so as they kick my alt's butt!!! Pet is usually gone in a few hits!

Where should I hunt at this level? I usually solo as so far I have had
very unpleasant experiences in groups.

Also, have searched the net and come up blank on weapon suggestions. Is
there a rudimentary list of useful weps, both H2H and Piercing avail
anywhere?

Thanks in advance for suggestions!
