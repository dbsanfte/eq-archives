Hi Nib

Looks like we're leveling about the same rate, I'm a lvl13  Cleric and have
read a few of your posts. I'm also in need of better equipment and looking
forward to the EQ Platinum addition. I tried joining an auction last night
but didn't know what I was doing. In the chat window there were quit a few
items that popup but were way out of my range. I used /auction WTB rings
with +2 wis but no replies. Maybe after the Platinum we'll be able to beef
up.

Good luck
