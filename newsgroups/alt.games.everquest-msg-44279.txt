Update is, I posted a message on a virus website and they were able to help
me.  I downloaded a really good antivirus utility that works from DOS and
was able to remove all signs of CIH from my comp.  It now works fine, all
virus checks come up 100% clean and I'm back to playing EQ.

*pops open a bottle of champagne* time to celebrate.
