Hmmm, maybe.  I didn't check out the whole zone, not having sneak
or an indoors castable Invis.  But with the player population
varying from 150+ to well over 200, most of them under 20, I saw
a lot of sitting around wait for a mob to pop going on.

WRONG.  The burrower-types are quite social.  Each of the four deaths
my baby Druid has suffered in PC is due to that social behavior (I am
slowly getting better at judging the agro radius and learning how close
to position myself so that the new pathing behavior will override the
vestigial remains of the old "run all over the fucking place and make a
train" pathing.
* Note for all you Bard haters out there:  only one of those deaths has
been due to some ass-wipe of a Bard kiting burrower-types across me as I
fought, and I spotted and laughed at his corpse on my way back to mine.

On the other servers it's usually easy to find uncamped 'shrooms to kill
(or it has been when I've tried anyway).  The 'shrooms are non-social
and the biggest problem I've had with them is leveling too fast to keep
up weapon skills on a melee.  On Stromm there are too many people out
there looking for the "easy meat".  I'll likely be back, but I'll be
looking to group as burrower-types that give decent xp are murder in
pairs and triplets when you're an unbuffed lowbie wearing (gasp!) actual
lowbie gear.
