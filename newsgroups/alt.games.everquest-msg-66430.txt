No. My position is that people who keep hammering home the fact that
Trilogy is on the shelves listing Windows 95 as a supported operating
system are engaged in equine necro-sadism and need to stop beating a
dead horse.

Windows 95 won't work with EQ. If you want to play EQ and have Windows
95, you're going to have to upgrade. No amount of complaining or, for
that matter, legal action is going to make EQ work under Windows 95.
