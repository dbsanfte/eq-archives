Hello

As part of the Palladian Quest, I was sent to the Secluded Valley to rescue 
the settlers from the gnolls.  I made progress but finally got killed (I 
hate dogs).  It respawed me at Windstalker Village, and I can't find the 
waypoint to my shard or the Valley.  Do I need to go back to NQ and have my 
mentor resend me back to the Valley.
