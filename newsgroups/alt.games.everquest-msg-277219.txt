I take it you're in Australia or somewhere in that region then? :)

My point is/was that they said as Splitpaw server was sat in Europe next to 
the French and German servers it would have the same restart times as them. 
Which would be the same local time as the US servers ( 4/5am ). It's a 
European server sat in Europe, if they did ever work out how to change 
Splitpaw's restart / update times to 5am, which was what they promised, then 
it would be around 3pm your time and better for both of us.

CS have said they'll forward my mail onto Moorgard for his comments ... I'll 
not hold my breath for an answer :-/
