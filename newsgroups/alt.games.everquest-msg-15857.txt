Like so many of your ilk, your delusions seem to create an all-new reality
that only you can see. I'd ask you to cite where I made up "posting rules,"
but since I already know that you will be unable to do so I will assume that
the heightened anticipation leading up to your middle school graduation has
left you seeing things a bit awkwardly. When you reach a time in your life
filled with as much excitement and trepidation as you are now entering -
high school is a big step, after all - one's skills at reading the written
word can suffer with all the distractions.

As I've stated elsewhere, say your piece if you wish. There are those people
so content in their own ignorance that they are unashamed in showing it to
the world. Thankfully, those of us who chose not to listen can do so. And I
will do so.
