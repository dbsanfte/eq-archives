Nah, I'm going to pay the $50.  All of his melee skills are maxed for his level, and that's not an easy thing to do.
I think it would take at the minimum of a week of playing (for me anyway) to get another character to 25
with the same skills.  I don't want to do it again, and it's worth $50 to me.
Plus, I'm kinda attached to him.  Hard to explain, but there it is.

The only down side is that I'll have to do the shackle quests again in order to get the whistling fist weapon
that I want to get eventually.
