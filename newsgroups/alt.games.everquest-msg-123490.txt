"Almost". Key word. Buffs wear off. Summoned equipment is there until
you camp.

What I read "least gear dependant" as meaning is which classes
function best buck naked... Once you start equipping stuff, the
character is no longer buck naked and hence isn't holding to the test.

Still, let's allow the magician his summoned equipment. Okay, you have
a naked magician with a bunch of summoned equipment. Still no
malachite. (If we allow the magician to buy malachite, then the
necromancer is allowed to buy food/drink) He's still pretty much
stalled while the necromancer can function perfectly well. The focus
items, etc don't do a naked magician much good without his pet still.

Okay, magician gets to buy his malachite. Buy the necromancer bread
and milk. Even again. Even without all the magician's summoned focus
items, I'd say the necromancer can still out-fight the magician and
his focus items...
