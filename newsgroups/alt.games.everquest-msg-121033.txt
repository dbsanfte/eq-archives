    Because the moment you ding 49, you lose the advantage of any level II
foci you had with respect to your new spells. This isn't like haste, where
you always have it no matter what level you are. You lose the benefit when
you upgrade spells UNLESS you also upgrade the foci. And, as you've seen,
there's a lot of foci for the average caster to upgrade - I'd say at a
minimum Mana Preservation, Spell Haste and Range Extension would be required
upgrades for all casters above and beyond any class-specific upgrades like
Healing or Damage.

    As I've said before, I believe that earring is targetted at hybrids. It
makes sense that some of the foci would be aimed at them, after all.

    Sol B, Guk, and KC for level II? You do realize that as soon as a caster
dings *level 24* they need to upgrade to level II, right? So your idea of
"balance" would have casters not having focus items until they reach the
very end of the level range in which they can use them? Sorta defeats the
purpose if this is about balancing casters versus melee at all levels, no?

    Right now a lot of these effects are as far away as your local mage.
Some are new, like the Affliction lines (which could turn out to be far and
away the most powerful, BTW) - those I agree will have to be watched
closely. But anything that mirrors a mage summoned effect has already been
in game for a while, and  usually have stats better than the crud on some of
the new foci.

    Only to the morons in EC that bought early. =)

    I imagine the specific foci effects on high-end items that is incoming
will accomplish this. If nothing else it should help differentiate the
hundreds of "NEC/WIZ/ENC/MAG" items somewhat and target them towards
specific classes.

    No, they threw things like HPs and AC onto melees without making them
spend anything by upping their Defense caps and their base HPs. Or upped
their damage output by moving them up one combat table, again with no effort
required by the melee in question. If you want a "class envy" style post,
bring it on - I'll grind your tank-top wearing butt into the ground on that.
