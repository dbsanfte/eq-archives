That is your interpretation. 

The world of Norrath is built from many different fantasy story lines.
It is a huge melting pot. Just because they stole liberally from
Tolkein doesn't automatically equate to Hobbits being the same as
Halflings. 

According to Tolkein Hobbits could be none of the Halfling classes in
EQ......

Rogue (Bilbo was an EXTREME exception for his race, thrust into the
role by Gandolf. Even then he needed a magic ring to perform the role)

Druid/Ranger (There is NO evidence in Tolkeins work to indicate that
Hobbits could cast spells or learn magic)

Cleric/Paladin  (There is NO evidence in Tolkeins work to indicate
that Hobbits could cast spells or learn magic)

Warrior (Bilbo, Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin picked up combat skills
as they adventured, but nowhere else do you see hobbits trained or
engaged in combat. Even at the end of the books none of them could be
classified as "warriors")

Tolkeins Hobbits were a simple people. They were nothing more than
peacful farmers. The exceptions (which you read about in the stories)
are just that "exceptions".  

Haflings (and most of the other content in the genre) in EQ are a
fantastic way to honor Tolkein, but they are not intended to be
Hobbits as Tolkein created..
