1.  That wasnt me that said it.
2.  He did *not* use it as a single basis, but also supported the argument
with "In every county of every state in the United states that has enacted
Shall-issue Concealed carry, the rate of violent crime has gone down since
the law was enacted."  As I read it the "In every county" was the strong
evidence and the Virginia v DC was merely a weaker supporting evidence.  In
any case if you care to argue other factors weaken the Virginia v DC
evidence you may, but its up to you to present the other factors if they do
exist and as far as I can see you havent.  Really though its a waste of your
time since you need to refute the "In every county" evidence to win the
argument.  Not saying I agree that that evidence is factual, but if true it
trumps.
