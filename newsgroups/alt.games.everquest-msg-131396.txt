XP is rock solid for me.  I've had no problems with it and have had a
machine up for 3 months now with no downtime running XP Pro.  Not only did
stability go up, but I actually got better performance when connected to EQ.
I had a multitude of problems when I had 2K Pro.  That's why I "upgraded" to
WinXP.
