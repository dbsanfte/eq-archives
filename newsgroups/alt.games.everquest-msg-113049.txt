As you've no doubt gathered from the many previous posts, lore means only
one in your posession.  This is where the wonderful world of Mules comes
into play.  Many people do not fill all eight character slots per server for
gaming purposes. In some of those cases, a slot (or more) is used to create
a character to hold things for their main, or take on a job the main cannot
do. If you create a mule character and then give a friend your SBS, then log
in your mule and your friend hands it off to the mule, then for most intents
you now can have two SBS.  SEE ALSO: Twinking.  Got an Elf Enchanter but
don't want to bother gettign them through Neriak for the Enchant Silver
scroll?  Make a DE, give them some money, and send the  DE in for it.
