Boy, do I remember that feeling.  Spent days on my first character saving up
bone chips, finally had 5 stacks of the blasted things, and tried to sell
them in EC.  No one ever replied, for days on end.  Finally, I sold all the
chips.  5 minutes later, "buying bone chips, 10pp a stack!".  I haven't
played that character since. :)
