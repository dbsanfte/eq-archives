So they should shoot for fewer patches in total and then just have 4
pissed off people, 8 happy people, and no really pissed off people. =)

Your assumption that SOE's patch schedule is best for the bottom line
is incorrect. It makes no difference to their bottom line to rotate
patch times... consider that not enough people are cancelling even if
they get screwed repeatedly to affect them... how could screwing
everyone a little result in mass cancellations?? It simply
wouldn't.... 

Their bottom line is safe either way.
