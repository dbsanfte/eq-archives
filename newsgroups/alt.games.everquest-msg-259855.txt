I've yet to observe any cyberslang creeping in, and at this point (4 
years into the experiment) I wouldn't mind if some did, since he clearly 
knows appropriate usage; like any slang, people adopting a bit of d3wd 
just to piss off the parents isn't really a bad thing.  Guess I'll have 
to wait till he's a tween for that though, my daughter's just been 
getting into punk the past year or so.

Which come to think of it is funny, she's rebelling 80's style; its like 
me putting on Herb Albert to piss off my parents!

Back to the written language thing; his other major source of reading 
material is Calvin and Hobbs, and Bloom County; you can imagine that his 
vocabulary is a bit... startling at times.  He's playing EQ and shouts 
out "dad how do you spell antiquated?"

Hmm, they should put in a spell checker he'd never need me.
