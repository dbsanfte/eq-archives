   The name is Age of Discovery (Age..... get it?), and Fooboy
(Bravefoot) is the GL.  You must kill ETP to get in... wait.  That's
not right.  You just have to be on when either he or I am on, and ask
for the invite in the channel serverwide.age:age or
serverwide.agetest:agetest.  Our ezboard is at
http://pub156.ezboard.com/bagetestgroup (though that address is
different today,  it used to be pub76 or something like that. 
Hmmmm.).  We orginally formed with the intent do get together once a
night and hit various targets as a group.  We ended up sorta of
petering out due to the fustration people we having with the problems
of playing on their home servers, and keeping up with leveling with
the  people who could devote more time to the process.  I am hoping
that this new /testbuff will help revive us.  In fact, I had a couple
of people join last night.  With luck, I will be playing a bit more
now.

     As far as the skill thing goes.. yes, further experiments have
shown that it does seem that skills do rise also.  I guess I screwed
up somehow the first time I tried.  I'll have to take another look at
the shaman of mine.  Anyways, after I started this thread last night I
started a Eurdite Necromancer.  All of her skills were max except for
money costing trade skills.  All of her specialization skills were 49.
 So if you make an intelligence caster, I highly recommend that you
know what you are going to specialize in.  Also, with all her new
gear, her intelligence was at 201. Not too shabby at all for a brand
new untwinked character.  She did have her pet spells, but of course,
no bonechips.

  Anyways, sorry for the faulty reporting at the start of this post.

Annie
