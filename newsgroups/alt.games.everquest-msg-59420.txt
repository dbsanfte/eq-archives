My advice would be to hunt in a better spot then. I have never killed one
mob in OT, and am happily level 60. My shaman was 29 when Kunark came out.

Canni isn't as good at lower levels when your regeneration spells blow, and
your self-regen isn't as good. Using it only to  get quick mana when you
are OOM is extraordinarily wasteful. Don't want to cannibalize whenever
your Hp is higher than your mana? Fine...but if your HP is at or very near
full, and your mana is not, then you are wasting valuable hitpoint
regeneration...like you were a druid or something *cringe*.
