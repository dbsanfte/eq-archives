Whats wrong with ooc?

Shout is BIG RED WARNING text...   do you need to shout to make yourself
stand out in a selection process by being the loudest person there?

And besides, red is an angry colour...  so thats reason enougfh to get
extremely pissed with people using it needlessly, no? :)

> Have you EVER gotten a  group using the /lfg tag?

Probably every pickup group I ever did, came as a result of /LFG on... and
from 1-60, that was a lot of grouping. (Didnt solo period on my monk from
30-60... mainly cuz I couldn't)

Spam is just my pet peeve.. I rarely (read never) use my ignore list if
somebody is badmouthing me (not that it really happens much)... but if im
exping and in ecauction channel, and somebody has an auction that fills my
ENTIRE chat screen, I ask them if perhaps they can shrink it so it doesnt
use so many lines.. or they go on ignore.

Nothing against them.. i just h8 spam
