You do not have to buy AP gear with points from the particular theme,
all of your APs go into a common pool.  What you have to do is earn
enough APs in a theme to "unlock" the gear you want.  For example,
if you want to get the plate armor from the Everfrost camp you have
to earn at least 760 AP doing adventures from that camp.  Once you've
done that you need never do another mission from that camp, you can
buy any gear costing 760 or less AP from that adventure merchant with
APs earned in any theme.
