If you have any intentions of getting your epic, you might reconsider
putting much time in to using two handed weapons unless you get a very
nice back-up haste item as well.  Swiftwind locks you in to dual
weilding, but with the haste and +attack, its really tough to justify
putting it away.

Note that it also requires some investment in AM I believe.  I thin
you have to be an AM1 ranger at the very least to get this ability.

I have endless quiver and AM1.  I can tell you that once I was able to
use 11 +3 damage arrows regularly, and once I got AM1, I have found
that I can already do more damage with archery than with melee, as
long as the MOB is unrooted and not walled.  I can also brag that with
just AM1, at level 59, I have gotten a trueshot crit of 1069 several
times, and non-trueshot of 525 or more.  That's only doing 130%
regular damage...  Imagine if nothing else changes, before I save
enough to buy an elemental bow (my goal by 61), staying at 59, just
getting AM3, I will have a max trueshot crit of 1645 and a max regular
crit of a little over 800.

I'm not "uber".  This is my main and I am in a "friendship" guild that
does more BSing than it does raiding, by a long shot.  Yet I can look
forward to being one of the most damaging classes in the game as long
as I spend my AA's right.

How could any ranger pass this up?

...6 rangers taking down Sontalak, a level 70 dragon in Western
Wastes, that usually takes a few more than 6 people to kill.

Hehe, took me 17 hours, but that is such a nice mask...
