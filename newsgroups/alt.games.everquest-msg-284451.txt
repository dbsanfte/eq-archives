Well, I tried to do this experiment, but now I'm just totally baffled.
The numbers without ANY haste aren't coming out as expected, so I'm
not sure what to conclude about the modified numbers.

Alas, I wasn't able to use a slow two-hander for my tests, because my
"song haste" clicky item is itself a weapon and has to be equipped to
activate.  Still, it at least has delay 20, i.e. exactly 2 seconds per
swing, which I thought would make it easy to do the math.

At first things looked like they were going fine.  I targetted an NPC
in PoK, faced away from him, and began attacking, watching for the
"you cannot see your target" messages.  I saw 20 in 40 seconds, check.
I then added a 36% haste item (Cowl of Mortality), and ran it for 50
attacks, which took 81 seconds, which comes out to about 23.5% haste?
I rechecked the baseline (no haste) for 50 swings and this time got
111 seconds.  I went back to the first test and realised that I'd
miscounted, counting the first swing instead of using it as a starting
point and then counting the NEXT 20 swings; turns out those 20 swings
really took 42 seconds.  I checked for "double attacks", i.e. two
attacks in the same second, but didn't see any (not too surprising
given I wasn't actually swinging).

So, despite not being sure why the unhasted attacks were slower than
expected, I did the math: 50 attacks in 111 seconds unhasted vs 81 secs
hasted = about 37% haste (111/81 = 1.37), which is within the measurement
error of +/- 1 second on both timings.  (110/82=1.34, 112/80=1.40)  So
I still wasn't sure why the baseline was slower than delay 20, but I
drove on and tried it without the Cowl but using just the clicky haste
on the weapon (Whistling Fists, should be 25% haste).

This one was just weird: 50 attacks took 84 seconds, which compared to
the baseline of 111 is somewhere between 29-35% haste.  I decided maybe
something was weird about attacking where I can't see my target, e.g.,
maybe my client knows I'm not really swinging and is doing all the work
itself, and the server would have more accurate timing?  So I took my
two-box combo somewhere and set up a duel, with my monk using just the
Whistling Fists to beat on my cleric who had his back turned.  This time
there were double-attacks, so I just counted how many different seconds
showed one or more swings.  As it happens, I had Speed of Salik, which
is 68% haste, but I removed my haste Cowl and didn't use the Fists' 25%
haste.  Not counting the first swing, the next 111 swings took 138 secs.
Normally I'd expect delay 20 to get 69 swings in 138 secs, so the haste
seems to be 111/69 = 61%, but given what I'd seen before for unhasted
swings I'm not sure what to compare this to.

Doggedly, I tried adding song haste to Speed of Salik by clicking on the
Fists about every 5 swings.  This time, I ran it for 278 swings, taking
358 seconds.  That's actually FEWER swings per second than with Salik
alone, though it could be that the clicky just had no effect and the
different is measurement noise.  (0.77 swings per sec vs 0.80.)

Anyway, I'm game to try a few more combinations, but at this point I'm
mostly just confused as to why the baseline (unhasted) numbers aren't
coming out as expected, and wonder whether there's something wrong with
my whole approach.  Any suggestions?

	-- Don.

p.s.: My current thinking is I should make sure I'm not somehow getting
two separate attacks in the same second and thereby miscounting them,
so I want to find a slow 1HB that I can dual wield with the Whistling
Fists, and use the different attack messages to identify the 1HB.  (The
Fists do "punches".)  A Rusty Morningstar is delay 44.  Can anyone
suggest a slower monk-usable 1HB?
