I so hate to see such blind ignorance, so I'll enlighten you:

Her mirror will not display your face.

Sensible people discourage such behaviour.  I, admittedly, am not
sensible in that regard;  I enjoy baiting and toying with the trolls.
However, I *am* respectful enough of those around me to stop when they
make it clear that my trollfeeding is bothering them.  I also have
enough humility to accept when the troll has actually managed to hook
me.

You, OTOH, are just being a jackass.  Please stop, you're better than
this.

And if your friend Foxeye had not been so quick to play Mother Hen,
leaping misguidedly to Annie's rescue, or if Annie had swallowed her
pride long enough to read for comprehension rather than dissention,
that would have been the end of it as well.

BTW, *this* is being rabid - solely to make a point about the
distinction.  I'll apologize when you show signs of recognizing the
distinction.
