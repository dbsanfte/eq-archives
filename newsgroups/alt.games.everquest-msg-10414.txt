See this is what happens when you try to post info you gleaned from web
sites, you don't glean very well.  If you follow the trail from Kith and
stop at the coordinates you list, you didn't follow the trail.  The
points actually on the trail closest to the shadowmen camp in WC are neg
375 pos 3650 and neg 492 pos 3465, with the former being actually closer
than the latter from what it looked like to me.  The coordinates you
listed are in fact almost right on top of the camp, but not on the
trail.

Oh and on behalf of all the folks who really hate it when you post
binaries to this non binary group, thanks a lot ya freaking moron.
