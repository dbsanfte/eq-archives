>Do I make my first major purchase weapons (fighting batons for

Here is my .02$.....
If you are not made of money concentrate on the following...

1. AC (Cured Silk or Wus for best AC/weight per pp)
AC is god for all melee types. You can never have enough.

2. Hit Points (+HP rings (4AC/+45HP, 5/55, 6/65), etc)
After AC HPs are the most important stat to pump up.

3. Weapons (a distant 3rd)
You don't need weapons to be a good monk. Yes, weapons make a
difference, but are not absolutely required. Pick up a light 1HB, and
2HB and start practicing with them in your early levels. Then buy the
expensive weapons when you can afford them.

Good Luck!
