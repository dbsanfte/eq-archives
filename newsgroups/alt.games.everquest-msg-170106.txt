Horse, like SOW, works only outdoors.  If you plan to spend appreciable time
indoors, particularly as a puller, Run 1, let alone Run 3, is far more exciting
than any horse.  Since run 1 is faster than most mobs (assuming you are
uninjured and unencumbered) this is the most important AA I've seen in the
game.  Run 2 and 3 are less important, although still quite effective, but the
only AA my cleric stopped leveling for pre 60 was run 1.... then again, I wasn't
a puller back then.
