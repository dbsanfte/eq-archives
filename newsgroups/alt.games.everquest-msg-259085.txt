Oops, I did want to make a suggestion....

If you can get down to Velious, Great Divide or Eastern Wastes, scary at
lower levels, I know, but...

If you can get down there, players will often have Velium weapons weighing
them down and will possibly be willing to part with them for a few coins,
or, if you are lucky, they may just give you a weapon or two.  No reason not
to give it a shot.
