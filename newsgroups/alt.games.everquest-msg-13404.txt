Undoubtedly that's what he had in mind.  It's damned hard (I can't think of
a way) to instruct a root caster on how root affects critters without
sounding insulting or patronizing.  If I COULD think of a way to accomplish
it I would have suggested it.  But since I can't, "thank you" (errr, or
silence, which I didn't think of until now) is the best option.
