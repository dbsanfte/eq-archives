Not that I have any desire to enter this conversation at all... but this
varies greatly by state.(1)     In Michigan, you're looking at over $4 per
pack.    I suppose it depends on how you define pocket change, but for the
price of a carton of cigarettes, you can purchase the EQ software, and it
only costs you three packs worth to play for a month.   Makes me happy
enough that I never picked up the habit.

(1) Unsurprisingly, the tobacco producing states are lowest.  $2.89 in
Kentucky.   New Jersey weighs in with the highest price at $5.81 per pack.
Of those prices, $.58 and $2.77 represent the tax components, respectively.

(perhaps not the most objective site, but the numbers don't look off based
on what I've seen.)
