Ornate patterns (other than leather pants and silk robe, which are for some
reason common), usually all in the 50-100k range.
Elemental planar tradeskilled items of ANY sort, ceramic foci,
tailored/smithed armor, JC'd rings, fletched bows, check eqtraders for
specific items, they're all in the 75k+ range though.

Oh, and while I'm at it....

WTB Ornate leather patterns (no pants), Ceramic totem of Xegony, Ceramic
water sprinkler of Marr, Cloudy ring of Pneumatic Force. (on tarew marr~)

whee.
