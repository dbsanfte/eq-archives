He may be "overseeing" the net loss of jobs, but no objective person
can honestly say that GWB is to blame. 

Trade imbalances have been a growing problem for decades now, and the
the current recession we are recovering from started more than a year
before GWB took office. The conditions that make it more attractive
for business to move outside the US were not created by GWB or his
administration. They are the end result of bad policy decisions
spanning several administrations, the strong arm dominance of
organized labor, and the over-regulating of American business to the
point where it is cheaper to produce overseas.

Anyone who is being intellectually honest knows that no seated
president is responsible for the state of the economy. The decisions
that the president makes can either speed up or slow down the current
trend, helping to end a recession sooner or make it last longer, but
the economy is still going to rise and fall in cycles. Some presidents
get lucky and hit an upswing while others hit the downswing. It's just
the nature of the beast.
