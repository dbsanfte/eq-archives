Hahahahahaha!
7th has Flowing Thought 1.
That's 1 mana point every 6 seconds.
To cast one Remedy (175 mana), that FT1 would need 17.5 minutes.

Significant, hardly.
The reason to get the shawl isn't for the FT effect, it's for the
stats (especially the STA and resists).  Believe me, even the WIS/INT
is largely meaningless.  At leve 50+, it's too trivial to cap these at
200.

Personally, I'll go for the Shawl of Preception...hard to beat THOSE
stats.
