Well sure, no one is ever going to say FM is just as bad as a
wipe, on a one for one basis.  But say you go FM for ten minutes
every hour, and wipe once every 20 hours; whats worse?  How much
time does a wipe really waste?  How frequent is it compared to
how frequently are you FM?

If you spend a LOT of time FM and very LITTLE time Dead, then its
time to run more risks.  If you spend a LOT of time dead and only
a LITTLE FM, then you are pushing things too far. 

To me, death is a very substantial waste, and FM seems easy
enough to avoid in most cases anyway; rarely do I see everyone
working as hard and fast as they can and still unable to spend
mana faster than its coming in, if it IS, the trick is to move on
to doing something harder, or to try doing what you are doing
with less people.  LDoN lets you try both; you can play with down
to 4 people, or you can go for the Hard missions instead of the
Normal ones... but if those don't satisfy, you are out of LDoN
options, its back to the rest of the world where you can pretty
much always go try something harder or with fewer people (unless
you are already soloing the sleeper)

No, its not "no one had any effective downtime", its  "no one had
any Wasted time."  Down time means time not actively fighting or
moving, time when you can take your hands off your keyboard, run
to get a soda, whatever.  But if you aren't FM, time spent not
fighting isn't a waste, you are regenning mana during that time
which you can spend later.

And yes, you have to slow down or go OOM, but that doesn't mean
down time, you can just pull smaller pulls or pull out fewer
stops when fighting them or go ahead and slow them or something;
its possible to vary the pull rate and still always have a mob in
the camp being killed.  

That said, my entire thesis is based on the principle that you
MUST slow down or go OOM, and you MUST speed up or go FM, and
thus regardless of how you manage it your AVERAGE speed is going
to be the same in the long run, assuming all other factors remain
constant.

An example I used in another thread is this:  Imagine you are
trapped in a construction zone, driving along in a single lane
with no shoulders, no passing lane, barriers on each side. 
There's a car ahead of you, limiting you to following it.  You
can speed up for a bit, but he's not changing his speed, so
eventually you'll get too close and have to slow back down to
match his speed.  You can slow down if you like, this will give
you more safety margin... but eventually you'll be moving further
and further back from him with no real advantage to it, so you'll
speed up to match his speed.  Now you can speed up a bit and get
closer again, slow down and lose some speed, whatever you like. 
In the end, assuming you don't permanently drive slower than him,
you are going to have driven the same distance he did in the same
time, your average speed will be the same as his.

Mana is like that; you can speed up for a bit, running your mana
down low, you can slow down for a bit, giving you more mana pool
to run with if you need it.  In the end, you cross the finish
line in the same amount of time if you averaged the same mana use
and regen as the other guy.

And running down to a LOM state and keeping yourself down there
the rest of the drive is like tailgating that car ahead of you;
you don't get there any faster, but you -do- risk a serious
accident if he has to suddenly hit the brakes

Splendid
