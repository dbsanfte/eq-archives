Yikes, don't post that to alt.polyamory, you'll start a heated debate!
Most polys, myself included, reserve "polyamory" to refer to multiple
relationships- with or without sex- where "swinging" is more often
about the sex, usually without a relationship.

For the most part I avoid debates on nomenclature and opt for the
blunt approach.
