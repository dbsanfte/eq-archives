Hmm... My personal opinion is that the ending of Pay it Forward was both 
unhappy *and* sucked. =)

Gotta have to watch American Beauty one of these days, but for the last 
three years I've weighted every movie against three hours of EQ, and more 
often than not, found them wanting. I only go to the movies these days 
when it means having a nice meal out with friends... Although I made a 
famous exception for The Lord of the Rings, and went to see it alone. =)
