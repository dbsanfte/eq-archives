Ctrl-S = sit on/off

I've never used a key for the melee attack button.  I have remapped "A"ttack
to the keyboard Enter (*never* have hit it by accident) but in my main
hotkey bank I open all fights with a backstab anyway so that macro has
'/attack on' in it

Add the /doability _ command to one of your regular macros.  You'll never
think about it again.  I've done that trick with Sense Traps and Disarm
Traps - almost never seen a trap and they're both maxed up.

Just like you are F1 on the keyboard, your group is F2 - F6.  F7 is nearest
PC in front of you, and F8 is nearest mob in front.
