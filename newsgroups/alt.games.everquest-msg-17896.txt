Note on the Unrest keys:

Although anything is possible with all the recent changes in other zones,
keys dropped in Unrest are generally garbage and need not be looted or
kept.  Unrest was originally supposed to be accessed progressively through
acquisition of keys like Najena and Befallen.  Some problems in zone design
made this impractical (I don't know the details, probably a pathing/aggro
distance issue) and the doors were permanently unlocked.

Be advised that my information is all second hand and any
corrections/confirmations are welcome.
