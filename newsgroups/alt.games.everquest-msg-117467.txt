When I have spare mana, I nuke rather than melee. Not that i do either since
i started a chanter. More interesting and no hassles over peridots/loot.
Maybe its mean to make the game interesting (role playing?), but I find
quarreling over loot to pay my expenses one off the worst parts of the game.
(second to quarreling over who owns a spawn). Maybe on FV people are better
standard. /shrug
