Aye, each to their own, heh. I've known groups form up, all keen to
get cracking, then the boat wait/trip have caused a few of the group
to leave due to more pressing matters - and groups are hard to get in
many zones, these days!

It seems daft that in a game where they are lately providing instant
transportation through PoK Stones, Plane of Tranquility portals,
Priests of Discord and the LDoN Magus', they are considering reverting
to one of the slowest, most pointless forms of transport the game ever
featured!  

There's hardly a new zone they've introduced, lately, that doesn't
have insta-transport in the zone, or in the zone next door...  They
should forget the stupid boat idea - it's time and it's game rationale
have coma and gone.  Oh and I wish they'd also get around to dumping
the damn Nexus Spires, putting a Translocator there too.
