Here's the link you're looking for:
http://eqlive.station.sony.com/news_section/newsview.jsp?story=44063

However, the details were only in the newsletter that was sent out. You
may have to sort through an archive of the newsletters. Start with the
June issue is my guess.

But yes. You heard correctly. And you don't "buy" the second key, they
give it to you. Of course, you'll have to pay the monthly fee for a
second account, but it saves you a few bucks, so it's nice anyway.
