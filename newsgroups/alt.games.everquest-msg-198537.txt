And I notice that you left out the part where I said, "He should get some 
satisfaction from having helped his guildmates." I stand by that statement. 

As I mentioned elsewhere, he shouldn't have been expected to spend all of 
his time during any period doing nothing but helping others with the 
trials. If the guild *does* expect that kind of time investment, then he's 
in the wrong guild. Of course there is also a difference between a guild 
expecting it and him martyring himself by doing it above and beyond the 
call of duty, just considering the possibilities, that is.
