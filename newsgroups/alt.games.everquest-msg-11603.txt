I've seen people trying to track him near the ogre shrine, apparently he
runs past nearby on his way to east zone edge. There is some talk that
he is a triggered spawn, I believe the Werewolf is supposed to be his
PH, so I guess you kill that then he pops at 11pm. Note this is largely
speculation from reading all the drivel posted to Allakhazam's message
boards so YMMV.

I suppose everyone will recommend you join a giant group in Rathe
mountains. You could mindlessly slaughter very green karana bandits and
do the sash quest. Find a nice, uncamped horde of bandits - there's one
on the shore east of the stone bridge in SK, which noone of an
appropriate level will be hunting at since they're all scared to head
into a level 20-30 zone. These will be extremely green, so you can just
massacre them all one by one without the others joining in. Of course,
you won't get any xp, but they drop bronze and bandit sashes. Each sash
will get you a couple of plat and another bronze weapon or shield or
something to sell if you hand them in to Chesgard in Qeynos. Not sure
how profitable this would be for a ranger, but its good for a druid who
can just AoE nuke the lot of them, gate to Qeynos and TP back...
