So buy it back.  Vendors keep all items sold to them, you may have to "mine"
them by buying out some other items they carry.

You may also find that the price to buy it back is more than you are willing to
pay, in some cases the markup is outrageous.  That BHS might only run you 12pp,
or it might cost 4Kpp, only way to find out is to try.

If servers havent' reset, there's every chance that vendor Still has your
weapon, by the way, unless of course some enterprising shopper has been going
around looking for bargains.
