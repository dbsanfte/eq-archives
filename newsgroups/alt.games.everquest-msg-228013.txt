Super bard?  I think either you don't know bards as well as you think you
do.. or you don't know monks as well as you think.

Lets see why bards can pull some difficult/very time consuming splits, or
even relatively simple pulls across a large distance..

Mez a mob, fade, voila split.
Snare a mob, fade, voila split.
Lull a room or the entire journey, agro 1 mob, voila split
Agro pof named, invis, run back to camp. Nothing but named and t2 sees
invis.. voila split (you won't get assist agro if you do it right)
Excess mobs come.. ok, highsun add1 and gate him home, gate add2 back home,
fade (to clear agro), hi mob_we_want now alone

Tanking options doesn't really matter much for anything above some zone
trash... because if im pulling fennin, xeg, whatever mini and take a hit..
my options are a) get 1 rounded and die b) feign and blow the pull (now disc
and mendless) c) keep running a few more steps till the next blow hits me

For lull specifically.. let me think about all the times i use that spell
(either my group, or me on my bot).
Well.. when were doing 1 group bot tower named, we pacify all the way up.
Will monk lull help here? nope...
When theres a room of 4 mobs and a named (e.g assasinate in ldon) and we
only want the named. Will monk lull help here? nope...
When im running a mob back through dangerous grounds and mobs have pathed
into my return path. Will monk lull help here? nope...

Tell me where lull will be a highly valuable tool for splitting?   Because
the tools that would aid my job are skills to deal with 3,4,5,6,7+ mobs.
Who cares about the ability to turn 2 mobs into 1 pull, thats the easiest
thing to accomplish feign pulling anyway.
Lull owns because even if it is a little mana intensive (pacification), even
after its duration nerf, it could do all of the above that "monk lull"
cannot do

Lol.. doesnt matter if i can feign every 0.1 seconds, if mobs will never
reset and forget me (of which many examples exist)
Monks want a 100% blur because aborting/reseting pulls is either a risk (to
monk or raid) by standing and checking what all is still agro.. or by
/quitting out.

We should NEVER have to quit out to clear agro in the middle of the field,
its one of the single most retarded things about our class v bards. Give us
an optional 100% blur PLEASE! (most if not all monks don't want FD to be
100% blur.. we just want the option to be able to erase ourselves and not go
through the retarded /q, 1018 bundle of fun)

In the good old pofear days with minis up, if you ever agrod one of the
wandering mobs you had 2 choices..  you either quit out, or you waited for
the imminent death touch.  After a dozen or so of that, it begins to get a
little tedious..

I think his point was if your using lull to split... its because you want to
turn a room of <lots of mobs> into a pull of 1 mob.
Monks cannot compete with any other lull class for speed and ease of that
split, with or without this worthless new skill.

That is why you would still take a pacifier over a monk after this bone

Thats harder than you'd think though, given how powerful (imo vastly
overpowering) the lull line of spells now is.  For monks to be back in that
old role they'd need something that does what pacify does... and take how
overpowering lull is, combined with fd + monks (general) far more extensive
pulling knowledge.. it would be pointless.  May as well /tell mob.. hey
follow me.. come alone.. it won't hurt!
