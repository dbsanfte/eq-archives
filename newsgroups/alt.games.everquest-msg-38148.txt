Account sharing is against EULA.  What is fun though is to invite your
friend over and have him use his own account and password to play on one of
your machines.  That certianly is not against EULA.

You could, however, own 2 accounts yourself, though I kinda think its
cheating to help yourself with other accounts; and even if I did own two
accounts I wouldn't log on to help myself.  Heck, I refuse to create mules.

Not being able to port, no matter how inconvenient, is an in-game obstacle
which I seek to overcome or work around through legitamite means like boats
or platinum.

Powerleveling is no fun for me.  If you powerlevel, you are playing the game
in a manner different than me, and I may go so far as to say different than
that in which it was intended.  Furthermore, a character that is
powerleveled is usually way underequipped in several necessary skills (i.e.
divination, conjuration, defense, offense, etc.)  The player who
powerleveled the character may also not be ready to play that character at
the level which it has attained.

I play a Shadowknight for example.  Suppose you played a druid, and decided
to powerlevel a Shadowknight to level 50.  There is a lot to be learned
about playing a shadowknight in different groups, as to what spells you
should have and use depending on who is available to maximize your
effectiveness and maximize your chance of survival.  There is also much to
be learned about the limits of a Shadowknight's abilities by attempting to
solo throughout your career.  For example, cast engulfing darkness to pull
and get too many, feign death.  Uh Oh!  Why am I being whacked?!  Oops, I
cast a damage over time spell. Loading....  Make mistakes like that on high
level raids and you will quickly find you are no longer on the invite list.
I'm sure this example can apply to any class.

With each character, I ask myself what I wish to accomplish that day before
I log on.  It is usually not experience.  Experience will come no matter
what you do.  Instead, I tell myself "I want to work on my Coldain Prayer
Shawl." or something like that.  Sitting in one place and killing creatures
over and over monotonously just to gain experience is boring.

Best of luck in your gaming.
