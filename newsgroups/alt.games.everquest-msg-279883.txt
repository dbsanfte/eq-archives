Never.  Mostly pointless line that is beneficial to the cleric only, and in
only limited situations.

Everytime a tank wants the highest hp total possible without sacrificing AC.

Doing signets to get into Anguish, let my 3-box team skip large chunks of
some instances.

Clerics don't nuke.  Could take all of them away and most wouldn't care.

Where you will have, at various levels:

1. Lower numbers    *yawns*
2. Lower numbers    *yawns*
3. Lower numbers    *yawns*
4. A nuke that nobody uses.
5. Lower numbers    *yawns*

Clerics are a fairly one-dimensional class.  Playing a cleric at 40 isn't
very different from playing a cleric at 70.  The upshot is that clerics are
the undisputed most powerful class, partly because they *are* so focused in
their abilities.
