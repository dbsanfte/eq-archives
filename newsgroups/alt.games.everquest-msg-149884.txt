Does shadow compact even make a noticeable difference after a few 
levels?  At 19, I don't even bother memorizing dark empathy anymore, 
because 30hp doesn't even make a noticeable dent anymore.

At 28 you can also transfer mana to other members of the group.  Not 
that *that's* worth anything ;)  (Of course it's 200 mana loss for 60 
mana gain, so the ideal is to have an enchanter in the group :))
