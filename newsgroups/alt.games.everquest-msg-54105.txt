Recently I've been having similar trouble with EQ. The servers haven't been
down I have just not been able to login. Whether they have problem with
their login servers I do not know, it just takes a couple of minutes to
login.

Doesn't help I know but it might not be the server that are down, just takes
a few attempts to log on.
