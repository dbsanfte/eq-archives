So for every character that I wanted to give one of these items to, they
would ALL have to be grandmasters in something....  well thanks for the info
anyway.

Needless to say, my characters will *never* see 250 in any trade skill (Im
pretty confident I can say none of them will ever ever be even 150)

Its a nice item.. but it sure isn't worth that much repetitive mouse
clicking for weeks on end.

getting pottery to 120 or so for my gate potions (prolly the easiest trade
skill) bored the living shit out of me, and made my arm ache.. retarded
trade skill implementation!

Too bad a 5% mod of 0 skill, is still 0 :)
