So the problem that occurred last night wasn't the problem or the
problem that only happened last night was really happening all along and
I just didn't notice the problem?  Cause I noticed a problem last night
that I hadn't noticed for the last couple of weeks and I also noticed
that everyone I talked to was having this same problem though they said
it was just last night and not a couple of weeks.  So before the problem
and after the problem there wasn't a problem but that seems to be a
problem since as you inform me this problem that was a problem was a
problem for a couple of weeks yet wasn't a problem for a couple of weeks
so far as those not having a problem were concerned problem wise.  This 
sounds like a problem to me, though you may have a problem with that but
problematic as problems can be this seems reasonable, though if it were
to go on for a couple of weeks it might be a problem.  Thank you for
your input on this problem, while I'm sure it was no problem for you to
provide it, future problems or lack  of problems will be much easier to
resolve now that the entire problem issue has been so well defined. 
Please pull up to the second window.
