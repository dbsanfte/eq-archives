Being two fights from elemental, puts you one from Sol Ro, lots of ornate 
drops there.

Can't look at your magelo, but, I'd be the plate bracer that drops in the 
tipt expedition would be a huge upgrade.  135hp plus other nice stats, 
effect that increases your chance to crit, and, I think an ATK bonus on it, 
not certain about the plate version.  I have the chain version, and I love 
it, heck, it's probably my single best piece of equipment.
