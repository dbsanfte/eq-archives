Enchanter, and Wizard... Enchanter for crowd control, fear, and also has pet
to help tank. and Wizard cause has desent nukes, plus as they progress can
x-loc, and help duo get around. IMHO, although mage or necro at earlier lvls
below 30 would both also be good choice. Gotta have enchanter too however if
duo w/ casters cause of Breeze then clarity that will help both classes.
