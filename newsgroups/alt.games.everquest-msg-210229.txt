I did a *survey*, 12:10 PM (lunch hour) central time on Tholuxe Paells.  I did
a /who all ranger 65, 60, 56, 55, then repeated it for a few other classes...
here's what i got - (totals):
16 rangers, 27 druids, 12 enchanters, 20 shaman, 17 necromancers, no
shadowknights, (lots under 55 though), no mages, (only 2 total mages online -
hmmm ... what's with *that*?), too many warriors to count.  
So I'm guessing you are right - there are a lot of rangers, and we all need to
start complaining *loudly* to SOE... :)
