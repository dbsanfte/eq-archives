That is not that far from some of the things you hear said in this
game either and it often would take several such reports to get
someone banned. This is not a children's game in the least, as bizbee
so skillfully illustrates! Frankly I'd not let any child (if I had
any) under the age of 18 play, ever. Or at the very least 17, which is
R rated or NC 17 age.

Just wondering, but isn't that threat actually not as threatening when
you say the soldering iron is coated in vaseline?
