I had the same problem. I returned mine and got a new copy that the key
worked fine on...one thing you shouldn't forget to do EMAIL VERANT! email
them with the cd key and write down the code that is on the cd as well, they
will quickly disconnect the stolen key user and it will really suck to be
him/her. (assuming of course that they are playing on verant's servers,
which would have to be the case if their server told you the key was in use)
