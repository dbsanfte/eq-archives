There is no common-law jurisdiction in the United States that I'm aware of 
which allows the use of deadly force to protect property; deadly force is 
always restricted to defense of life (yours or others). Having said that, 
there is one situation that often gets described as an exception. That's the 
situation where someone breaks into your home. In those situations the use 
of deadly force has been allowed even in the defense of property but I 
suspect that the theory has more to do with standing one's own ground in 
one's home than a conscious desire to exalt property over life.

Right, and this isn't just California, many states (if not most or all --  
I'm not up on the law of all jurisdictions, but I'd be surprised to find 
many exceptions to this long-standing legal theory) support this rule. The 
common law views one's home as one's castle and grants the widest latitude 
to measures taken in defense of it and -- apparently -- anything in it.
