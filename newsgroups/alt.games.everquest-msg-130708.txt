}The only thing I can think that might cause it is if your system clock

Sounds like the right track.  I have a little voice in my head whisering 
'CMOS battery'.  I'm not sure how relevant that is with newer MBs though.  
But I've seen a slowly failing CMOS battery show up first as the system 
clock getting flaky.
