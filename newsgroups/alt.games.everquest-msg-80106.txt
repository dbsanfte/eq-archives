Um, no.

The only thing a typical medieval European foot soldier's one-handed
sword will do on contact with plate armor is bend or chip.  The entire
"age of chivalry" came about because the nobility could afford to wear
suits of armor that made them effectively invulnerable, at least until
the weapons caught up.  The armor was worse than useless against
anything but the lightest of missle fire; it slowed you down and made
you an easier target.  (Agincourt was such a massacre because 10,000
French knights tried to run across what was effectively a swamp to get
to 1500 English longbowmen.)

Those corpses were produced by attacks with large pole weapons or
attacks made from a speeding horse.
