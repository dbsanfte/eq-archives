To be fair she was deliberately rude and proceeded to lecture people
on a point she knew nothing about in the original post; some could see
that as deserving a patronising response without being as severe as to
call someone a cunt. For me at least the degrees of insult in someone
I'm obviously aggressively arguing with calling me (or I them) 'mate'
or 'friend' or 'sweetheart' is worlds apart from 'cunt' or 'fucker'.

Shrug.

Maybe its different for you, but I dont see pulling out 'cunt' for mild
irritation as being more 'honest', just more offensive.
