I havent played WoW yet but I have been playing EQ2 for the last month. I 
cancelled my subscription a few days ago as there were too many aspects that 
kind of ruined the experience for me.

To start off with, the game looks and sounds amazing. I love all the voice 
acting and I have never had a single performance issue with any aspect of 
the game. I do have a ninja pc so I guess that's how it should be.

What ruins the game for me is:

1. Grouping - Sorry I know it's been done to death but I hate having to 
group to progress. I just dont have the time to join a guild etc and I 
prefer solo play.

2. Progressing - I maybe wrong but I dont think my character really 
progressed at all from lvl 11-17. I seemed to have the same equipment and 
just gained new skills. I didnt like to group or have the time to, so I 
found that whatever creature I killed they simply were not dropping chests.

When I checked out the people working in groups, they all seemed to have a 
lot better equipment to me. I presume this is because they worked together 
and took down ^^ mob groups who drop chests. Good for them, but bad for the 
solo guy.

3. Selling - I cant believe you have to sit in your room to sell items. I 
think it's a shockingly bad decsion by the designers.

4. SOE Forums - Shockingly bad forums, I dont know what program they are 
using but it's awful.

5. Map - Awful! Why cant you see what direction you are facing? Why arnt 
locations you have visited marked on the map? Why cant you scroll the map?

I still think the game has a huge amount of potential, and even now i'm 
tempted to signup again while I wait for WoW to reach the UK. It's just the 
grouping aspect that kills off my enthusiam. Even though Sony have said that 
they will be adding more solo content the game seems designed for people who 
like to group, and for guilds. I can imagine higher level play for solo 
players being very annoying though.
