Yea, second time I did that.. :^(

What I do is change my posting info so I can CANCEL those sick
bastards posts...

Sometimes I get so damn pissed off, I forget to change the info
back...

Pretty lame excuse.
The funny thing is you continue to attack your own daughter when you forget to
change from Tanya Worley back to EQ. Explain that will you.
