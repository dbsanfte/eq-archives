And when they make an update to those, what?  Burn a new CD and make everyone
purchase it yet again?

This is an evolving game (albeit sometimes slowly).  Patches and expansions,
both minor and major, are common.   For the major ones they sell a CD and save
you days worth of downloading on a normal modem.  For the minor ones they let
the patcher handle it, and you can suffer through the half hour download once
a month, if even that much.
