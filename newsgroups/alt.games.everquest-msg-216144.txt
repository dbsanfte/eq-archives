Most of the groups I've been in just haven't been up to handling
more than 2 mobs at a time on a steady basis.  I can use Pacify
to set up a series of double pulls from rooms that may, depending
on agro radius (i.e. depending on mob level) give me as many as
6 or 7 if I don't break the chain in advance with Pacify.  And
when you're crawling without a mezzer and have doubts about the
tanking stamina of the other melees (we're talking random mid-50s
groups here, not regular groupmates or well geared 65s with piles
of AA), rapid slaughter of single pulls seems a lot more sensible
than finding out the hard way that your group just isn't up to
efficiently killing multi-pulls.  The gear and skill disparities
I've run into from one group to the next really argue for opening
with some singles and then an easy double just to see how well my
"associates" cope as a team.  Sometimes we stomp the dungeon,
other times our only chance is "perfect" pulling of singles as
fast as possible.  There are more than a few Clerics and Enchanters
out there who are not particularly good at mana management, and
plenty of Rangers and Beastlords and Monks who aren't sturdy enough
to tank an unslowed mob for more than a few seconds.  Those are the
things that impact my tactical decisions the most, YMMV.
