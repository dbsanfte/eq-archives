No clueless...you may not call me Matt...try reading the thread and
deciphering who Matt is...dumbass. Or have Lokari trace the location of this
IP and compare it to Matt's considering how great she is at doing that...

Your assumption is as lame as your attempt to flex your ego in front of your
little buddies here...but maybe they'll accept you anyways...you seem to fit
into their mob mentality...

Wow...change that subject to take a shot at someone that's not involved in
this thread...good show Biff...BRAVO!

See number 1...dumbass...

Then KF me too and STFU...nothing more annoying that some dimwit that feels
the need to tell the person that they're putting them in their KF.

I'd be more than happy to bring him back here for ya...

Man you're an idiot...gotta love a guy that puts all his eggs in one basket
to make an assumption...try checking the headers you putz...I'm not matt

Then you're finally on the right track...

Until now...
