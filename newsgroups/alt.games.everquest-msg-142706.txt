There are still newbie areas.

My wife and I just recently started playing EQ, and we still have a lot of
fun, though I'll have to admit that some of our old friends from The Realm
(yeah, I know I just dated myself a bit....) are there.

Get the EQ Trilogy and sign up for just a month at a time.  Minimal $$
commitment, and you can quit if you don't like it.

Of course, EQ2 is coming out Real Soon Now (tm).
