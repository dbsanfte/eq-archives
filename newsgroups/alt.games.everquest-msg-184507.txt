Hi I was wondering if anyone who had attended a fanfaire in the past knew if
the EQ store items there are shoppable only if you are a registered fanfaire
attendee? Are they usually found inside the event or outside with vendors
ect. The only reason I ask is with a family of 4 there, it would cost over
$400 bucks just to attend... Which is nuts considering my youngest is only 6
and my wife doesnt even play! Oh well guess thats enough verant/SOE rant for
now.

AND
NO YOU CANT HAVE MY STUFF!!!

thanks for the info..
