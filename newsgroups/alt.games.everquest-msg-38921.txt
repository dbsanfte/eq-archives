I didn't imply anything of the sort.  The desire to kill high end mobs isn't
necessarily a desire to be uber.  If mob x exists, and is killable and drops
loot, chances are, you hope to someday kill it.

When Kunark was young, very few guilds had seriously attempted Trakanon.
FoH was one of the few who repeatedly tried and failed and learned from
their mistakes.  Finally they managed to tame the beast, and slowly more and
more people took what FoH learned, and started doing Trak.  Interesting that
you should bring up the topic of jealousy.
