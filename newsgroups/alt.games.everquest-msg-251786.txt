Cleric epic seems very useful, although I'm not a cleric. I know that
having one of our epic-ed clerics on a hunt/raid is very useful in case
of deaths and/or wipes. How can a 96% mana-less rez NOT be useful?

As a ranger, I haven't completed the entire epic, only got my Swiftwind,
but that seems very, very useful to someone who is, most likely, never
going to see the elemental planes let alone Time. 40% haste is a good
thing, no?

Other epics, I have no clue on.

Someone's already pointed out the last prayer shawl is definitely
worth more than anything you're going to find in the bazaar for 100pp.

I'm equipped right now with three quest items that I'm extremely happy
with. Swifwind, Eyepatch of Plunder and Helm of the Tracker. I'm also
working on Shield of Bane Warding (I won't carry it, but I'm working
on it. :P )
