    Things have changed, Meemers. The pets can now churn out 70-odd DPS on
worthwhile targets because they let them be a reasonable level, and have
summonable weapons with nifty procs. Add in damage shield damage and mage
nuking damage, and you get an absolute machine. And mage nukes got upgraded
in PoP, too, something that hadn't really happened since Kunark.
