Yes I second what Graeme says about gate potions. As the guild
alchemist I was asked how much they'd cost and with my great faction
best I could do on cost was 252pp per potion at cost. Only way it
would go that cheap might be a player who two boxes, which I have
discovered in my guild, they make fantastic amounts of money and it's
likely it's a shaman leveling alchemy on those knowing he could sell
cheaper because of his income. The alternative would be one of the
Shaman gate potions which drop you in a PoK book zone for roughly high
70spp.

Personal my advice to my guildies is if you have lots of plat to blow,
thern I'd buy em, but if not, there are cheaper alternatives with
minor inconvieniances.
