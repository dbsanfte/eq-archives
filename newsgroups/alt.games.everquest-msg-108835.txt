Agree. Honestly I love my 36 troll sk but the regen kind of runs thin
at about level 30 when you get your 40 hp lifetap, even if all you do
is solo. Regen did sure help me until I got to 30 with that better
lifetap though. Right now If I could switch I'd be the ogre.

If you make an ogre MAX sta, I think your str would be high enough,
then put points on agil so its 75 or a bit more ( I think ogre is less
than 75 by default.) It MUST be 75, more than that is not a big deal
but a cushion is good in case you have minus agil gear. Ogre warrior
and I think even SK can have the max stamina its possible to have on a
character at creation (150? ), so its a shame to waste that since its
the only stat that really makes a diff (outside of making sure agil is
75 or more)

Both of their int is really high enough as a hybrid. Since they made
the mana changes my mana pool as a troll of 36 seems huge and I never
added any to int I don't think. I'm in full crustacean nearly to
really add the sta and hp on, with a clay guardian shield. My next
upgrade will be a barbed ringmail tunic for about 5 k plat (great deal
really.. this item seems pretty common now too), cougar claw earring
and ivandyrs hoop, etc. So I don't really have any int gear I don't
think, well except my moss but I mostly use the EXCELLENT long sword
of ethreal energy now.

Troll is fun but at 36 I'd rather have the ogre more uber sta and not
getting stunned from the front. I do get stunned now and again soloing
and find it irritating ;) With the iksar tunic I throw on if my hp get
low, the racial regen is kind of nice though. As a troll even at 36 by
the time I get mana back, I'm always at full hp.

Oh, another thing is troll xp penalty is 20 percent and ogre is 15
percent. So ogre will level a bit faster but my experience is that as
a troll sk up to level 30 you solo SO Much faster than the ogre that
it makes up for it. In fact, I started my troll sk after the hybrid
xp/mana disabilities were finally removed and basically its one of my
fastest leveling characters. Up until recently it seemed that I walked
outside and leveled. 

My troll moved to east freeport at level 2 or so, got bound on the
outskirts, did the dismal rage quests in east freep sewer and could
train there then. Continued doing dismal rage quests (great xp) up to
14 or so while htting some things to keep melee up. Moved to the
overthere zone and got a bind, went from 14 - 23 pretty fast in
overtehre from the city to the zone to warsilks (At 23 most stuff
there turns green, with the other half of the zone all being red.. so
you leave and come back around 34) I went to Lake of ill around 23 and
started soloing that goblin cave. A bit plus 30 I moved to velious and
soloed VERY FAST on orcs around 33 and 34 in crystal caverns (getting
black crystalline robe a couple times to sell in the deal ; )   )  Now
I've been running around in dawnshroud which is GREAT solo (luclin) or
with a cleric/druid) Its amazing how easy an sk is once you have FD ;)
