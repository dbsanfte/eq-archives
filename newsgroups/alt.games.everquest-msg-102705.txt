Oh sure, they put a "Warning - Game play is Addictive" on the box and people
will then come back and sue Verant when they cancel their account because it
didn't hold their interest.  I don't think beyond the fact it says 13+ on
the box and the fact that in the EULA you have to hit 'Agree' to each time
which states that if you are under the specified age list there (is it 18?)
you need the consent of a parent or guardian.

IMHO, people simply get to high strung on these legal crusades.  Now
granted, the lady in this story could very well simply be seeking
information, so be it.  Can Sony/Verant really be held accountable for this?
or rather, should they be?  I don't think so, next all the ruined
marriages/relationships due to EQ will come up in a class action against
them.... yikes.
