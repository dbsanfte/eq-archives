$3 a month isn't a huge deal to me, but I don't follow the "it's
justified by the expansions" argument.  Verant developed expansions
that they then sold to customers.  Yes, there are new zones, but does
that actually increase their hardware costs?  Presumably when they add
zones, the players spread out and they can reallocate hardware to
support the zones w/o buying new machines.

As far as "inflation", there certainly hasn't been inflation in
hardware costs... compare what you could buy 3 years ago vs. today.

So I have some trouble buying the "due to increased costs" argument. 
I suspect it's more the fact that the competitors have upped the going
rate, and Sony doesn't want to leave money lying on the table.
