That does sound odd to me... only conclusion I can reach is that at some
point you were using '/follow'... which automatically switches your run/walk
button... and you didn't notice.

Little known fact... your move speed is based on your AGL stat... so
ordinarily your Halfling should outrun a Dwarf (Halfling base AGL is 95,
Dorf is 70).

The reason you slow down when seriously injured is because your AGL drops
(to 2/3rds and then to 1/3rd normal).

When in a group, always try to '/follow' the char with the lowest AGL, and
remember to check the Run/Walk button whenever you drop out of '/follow'
mode... chances are it'll be set to Walk. :o)
