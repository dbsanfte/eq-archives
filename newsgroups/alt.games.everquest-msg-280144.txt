If I sent them a cheque every month it woud be clearly illegal for them 
to modify the amounts written on it to match what they think I owe them.

The phrase "from a corporation" is extraneous and irrelevant. Its 
unethical to steal. Period.

It is unethical to steal. Period.

Obviously I disagree.

Obviously I disagree.

I authorize them to automatically charge my credit card the Account fee 
and applicable taxes. I do not authorize them to make 'corrective' 
charges willy nilly at their discrection. I do not authorize them to 
retroactively bill me for previous months once they have been paid for 
them in good faith at their discretion.

No. That was the first mistake. And I don't agree that I've authorized 
them to do fix it like *this*.
