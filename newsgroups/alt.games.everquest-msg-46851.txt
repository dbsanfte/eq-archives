My guess, is that Dr Solomon is using scare tactics to get people to buy his
software.
Step1, post a harmless, yet annoying Javascript, to newsgroups, which loops
itself and claims that a virus has been detected.
Step2, post a message saying that someone has sent viruses into the
newsgroup, and post a link to your antivirus software.
Step3, watch unsuspecting people buy the software.

I'm by no means a lawyer, but there's got to be something illegal about
this.
