I see it happening this way. The uber guilds will rule early on. But then
everyone else will catch up in level and skill. The power should start to
shift around then.

Supposely it's not like an EQ uber raid where uber guild membership is
required. Casual players can fight along side uber guilds as well as against
them in large groups.

On the PvE side, they also mentioned that the toughest NPC's are designed to
be equal to 16 PC's.

I always thought this was the case. Basically xp are earned from PvE which
advance "level". rp are earned from PvP which advance "title". As you raise
in level you gain spells, skills, hp, etc. As you raise in title you gain
power.

I don't see it. If you don't want PvP, don't go into the PvP areas. You can
still be an untitled level 50. Sure you would lose a fight to a highly titled
level 50, but you're avoiding PvP anyway right? In PvE, you and the titled PC
have the same abilities, the titled PC just does them somewhat better. But in
PvE who cares, unless you suffer from envy.
