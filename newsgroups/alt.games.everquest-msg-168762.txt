I'm just wondering, I know the PoK book in Firiona Vie is in some
dead-end area over by the DL zone entrance, which is south of the LOIO
entrance.  Is it a fairly safe run to get from the PoK book to the
LOIO zone, or does one still have to worry about those spider mob
things or any other high-level mobs?  (the only time I've ever been in
LOIO is with an Iksar so of course I didn't have to worry about
traveling through FV to get to LOIO). 

Thanks in advance,
