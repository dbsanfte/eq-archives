I liked the old particles.  They had heavy use of anti-aliasing and
transparency.  The new ones look like a cartoon drawing.  Very out of
context in this game.  I don't like them - except for the new ice
comet.  All I could say when I first saw it was WOW!  It's like an
actual comet that comes out of the sky and hits the target, with a
cloud of dust spreading out after it lands.

The healing spells got the new particle effects, as did most nukes. 
The fire nuke kinda looks weird with the target becoming engulfed in a
cloud of orange - it doesn't look like a fire at all.  The AE nukes I
can't even see.  When I cast an AE nuke, I see a bunch of cartoon
flames dancing around me, and when the nuke lets off, I don't see the
mobs on fire at all.  I see nothing around the mobs.
