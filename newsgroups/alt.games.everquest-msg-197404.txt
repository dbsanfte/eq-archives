Funny thing is, I agree with a lot of what you have to say here, and for
that matter with what Rumble has to say.

I don't agree with the plan to open that full list of zones they proposed
with no flagging at all.

I actually cant think of a flag out there right now I don't like, except
for the POS/POV one.

How about opening POS/POV to 60+, instead of wide open to 46+, would that
take care of matters?  Just as "level to 46" is a very open ended quest,
requiring some dedication but a very wide number of possibilities, "level
to 60" would restrict access in general without focussing the meat grinder
down by class and ability to muster a team of well equipped or high
leveled buddies to

I fail to see how passing any trial or flag at all has anything to do with
ability to contain yourself in OOC or kill stealing, that part of your
objection is a mystery to me.

Now if you want to talk about people who've been to what we used to call
Air plane (is it Sky now?), those are some people who know how to not use
