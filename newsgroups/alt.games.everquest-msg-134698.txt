Let me start by observing that I think Sony/VI did a great
job with the bazaar code. It is easy to find things, and
the Bazaar was not surprisingly jammed at midnight PST on patch day.

But I wonder what will happen to the generally-accepted
price thresholds on items. I sampled various common items
and found for instance that in cases where the going
average was, say, 200 to 500 that there would usually be
at least one lowballer in the group, significantly 
undercutting the rest of the prices.

Clearly, this will provide an opportunity for people to
clear out bank trash, particularly people with multiple
accounts who can simply park a trader.

So I open this up for discussion with these points:

1) Will the bazaar ease pressure on the EC tunnel?
2) Will it seriously and/or adversely affect pricing
of items?

Very much interested to hear this group's opinions
on these questions and related observations.

Also, this finally solves the most maddening issue of
P2P transactions:

Auc_01: WTS Shiny Thingy of Doom
me: How much for thingy?
Auc_01: offer
me: nm

Now, we know. Fair or not, we know the price.
