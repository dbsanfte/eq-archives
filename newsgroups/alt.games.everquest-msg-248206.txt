While you raise some good points, it's naturally gonna fall on deaf ears, 
if any ears at all, at SoE. EQ2 will most certainly be a money maker. It 
will likely be well worth the purchase....as will WoW. ;)

I just hope they don't make the same mistake other MMORPG's have recently 
and strive to make every class just as powerful in all respects as every 
other at all times. There is a lot to be said for a variance of 
effectiveness over the life of a character, powerful at some levels, less 
so at others.

Also, one of the primary aspects of EQ that kept pulling me back in was 
that when people played their class well and applied known successful 
strategies, vastly greater results were achieved. I've seen "class 
balance" taken way too far in other games.
