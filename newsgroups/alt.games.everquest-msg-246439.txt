Palindrome  said:

}Everyone wants groups like this, obviously.  You'd be mad not to!

I agree with -part- of that.  The problem I've noticed is that, by 
emphasizing the 'mobs on a conveyor belt' part, and eliminating all forms 
of downtime they possibly can, groups no longer have -time- for the 'fun 
banter, friends made' part.  Nobody ever takes a break.  Of course, that 
has nothing to do with 'dumbing down' and everything to do with people 
being raised in the environment of timed LDoN missions that don't allow 
for old-style 'med breaks'.

But downtime was frequently my favorite time.  People actually talked 
then.
