I post under Ghandi and have exclusively for at least 8 months. I have never
attacked your children (ever) even though it seems to make no difference to you
when you accuse me of it. I am doing as you did and posting this to all the
newsgroups you did to tell everyone what a two bit liar you are. I admit I have
talked about your old Cunt and how you have posted her picture on the internet
in an attempt to secure other men for her. If you want to take exception to
that you are free to do so, but I take great exception to you trying to say I
am posting anything negative about your kids. I'm not posting to convince you
but simply to let others know I have never posted anything about anyone's kids
here or anywhere else. Just because someone may or may not use the same news
provider as I do means absolutely nothing.

MB,

This is a post from Goondi/MD who thinks it is appropriate to attack
my 15yr old daughter...

You can tell by the headers as to who the culprit is...

Sad pathetic scumbag, ain't he??
