Depending on the group and location, this might be useless... as can 
slowing if the mobs are falling fast enough.

On the other hand, an enchanter who isn't otherwise being run ragged has 
at least two other jobs open to him: luller being the first, with likely 
the highest charisma he's well suited and with several mez options 
available is the luller best suited to handling things going 
dramatically wrong.

The second, though, is DPS; with a charmed pet an enchanter can be one 
of the highest DPS classes in the game.

Splendid
