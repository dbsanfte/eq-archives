My baby monk got a dual wield skill raise while chasing after
something too far away to hit. ("Your target is too far away, get
closer!" "You have become better at dual wield! (14)" "Your target is
too far away, get closer!")
And last night, I think a drolvarg stunned himself on my damage
shield. I'd aggroed him a while earlier and lost him, he found me
again while I was looking for something to kill. I pulled him to my
spot, he was hitting me as I was casting root (channeling skill 200,
hehe) and suddenly span away as if he'd just wanted to pop me one or
two and then run off and kill something else. I can't recall EVER
seeing a mob do that before :)
