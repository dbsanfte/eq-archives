But then you're just giving a dishonest answer.  Better to give no answer at
all.  "If someone really cares, they can do the research to find it."
Particularly since you comment on one piece of "legally shady" software and
ignore the half dozen more prevalent others.

I have a feeling you were perhaps aiming for "Macroquest" with your
paragraph, as no one has talked about "EQMacros" much for a couple years
now.
