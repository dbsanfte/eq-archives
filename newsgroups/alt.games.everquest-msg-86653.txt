Subject: What EX Leveling mix Post 50?

When I made 51 I went to the alt ex menue and  selected 100 percent to alt
expereince. After a while it dawned on me that none of the experience gained
was going toward leveling my character toward 52. Bright huh?

So the question is how do you plus 51s have it set?  50/50 er.....? and why.

Thanks in Advance
