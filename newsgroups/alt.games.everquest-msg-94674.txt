I thought group damage is counted en masse, so for the pet to get much xp, 
that pet would have to outdamage the combined damage of *all* the PCs in 
the group (i.e. not likely unless you have a group of 6 necros and mages 
etc).

When a pet dies (including if its a charmed mob) the corpse poofs, you 
don't get to loot it.
