Port into stonebrunt, or run through The Warrens. Go to the coast, there's a
big boat to take to get to the new island

Neato trick... I went there (in beta) and saw about 30 people sitting on the
boat, said it had been there for nearly an hour... so I'm poking around the
boat, and notice there are doors.. so I click on the door to open it and
'bang'. I get ported to the boat on the other side.

Alas, my test character (level 21 monk) just wasn't up to adventuring in the
new zones (I did feign flop around quite a bit looking at things.)

I colored some armor... works better than I expected..
the thingies (not horses) look neat

I didn't see any of the new spells...
