When I play PvP, I like putting these types to flight while they're preying
on others.

When it was still possible to kill those under level 6, I would bring my
characters up to 9th level or so, and then wait for the 'Newbie PKer's' to
show up.  I'd hide somewhere, and wait for them to try to slaughter the
latest batch of newbies.  Once they thought they had their prey cornered,
I'd blind/root/stun/whatever them.  Then I'd watch with satisfaction as the
newbies kicked their evil rears back across the zone line.

Who says playing the good guy is boring?  On PvP, it's a bigger challenge
than just being the most merciless jackass "bandit" on the block.
