STOP

Who's complaining? Stop putting words into my mouth. I'm merely
pointing out facts. I love WoW. Simply saying that the fact is,
Blizzard doesn't run a flawless show, either. Or did anyone not hear
about the hideous lagstorm launch of WoW? Waiting 1-5 -FULL MINUTES-
just to loot at the peak.

They got it fixed, took them most of the week, though.

But, all that, I understand. The game had a staggering launch. That
many people flooding onto the servers the very first day was bound to
cause trouble.

My point is that shit happens. They deal with it. And SOE is dealing
with this.
