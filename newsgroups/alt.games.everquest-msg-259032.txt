I'm having the same problems with my system.  SOE has giving up on me also.
I've even replaced my video card from a GeForce 4200 to a Radeon 5600 Pro
and still have the same problems.  Crashing to desktop.  All from the DX9
patch.

Just to make sure it's not my W2k OS that's causing the problems, I recently
took a blank hard drive, installed Win XP on it, loaded all the updates
(pre-SP2), including SP1.  Updated the 4 in 1 drivers for the VIA chipset,
Direct X 9.0C (I believe it's C now),  SB Live, and Radeon.  So all drivers
on it are up to date.  Installed EQ from scratch, left all options on
deault.  Sat in PoK for 5 mins with no crash.  Decided for the true test.
Tried to zone in to Bazaar.  "We have detected that your client....".  Damn.
WTF!  *sigh*  Turned off all textures, models, etc, pretty much dumbed down
everything I could.  Zone into Nexus again.  *crash*

So apparently what ever new code Sony added to the game is incompatible with
my hardware.  I was running EQ with DX9 already installed just fine.  Then
they did their patch.  And all went to crap.  3-4 months so far that I
haven't been able to play.

I'm not buying a new computer just to play so I guess I will have to say
goodbye to EQ and try EQ2 when it comes out.....

Frustrated,

Rom

p.s. By any miracle, does anyone have any ideas?
