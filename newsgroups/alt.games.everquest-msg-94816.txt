You're right, of course.  That's why I always have my monk
pull see invis mobs and feign next to druids medding invis
who may (or may not) be answering a call of nature or
something.   You can usually tell by walking up and saying
"SoW me, Bitz."  If they don't answer, it's time for a visit from
Mr Train loaded with see invis passengers.

Hell, if they die, it's their own fault.  And there's nothing the
GMs will do if they catch me because the druid was AFK.

A.G.E Rule #741:  Never /AFK.  Always /camp, then come
back, even if you're going to be gone from the keyboard
for only 75 seconds.  Any idiot who trains you while you're
AFK -- no matter how short -- is the salt of the earth and
shouldn't be held responsible.
