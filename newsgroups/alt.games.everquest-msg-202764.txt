I programmed it to map to my left arrow key.  Every time I turn left, it
does a sense heading....works like a charm.  I programmed my right arrow to
include Sense Traps.  Works pretty good for increasing the ability, but if
you actually find a trap, you get spun to face it.  That can be annoying if
you're in a hurry and a right turn spins you back towards, lets say, a train
of mobs....  If I'm in an area where I know there are traps, I disable that
function off of my right arrow.
