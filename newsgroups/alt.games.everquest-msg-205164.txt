make two macros (from memory)

/stop song
/cast 1
/pause 30
/stop song
/cast 2

and 

/stop song
/cast 3
/pause 30
/stop song
/cast 4

then you don't have to worry as much about getting the timing right on
your twists, once every 6 seconds, instead of every 3. Depending on
your dex (I think) you might be able to reduce the 30 slightly,
reducing the chance of a song running out before you can reapply it.
