I have only played around with this a little but I'm pretty sure you
will get little or no experience on your 70th character.  If the mobs
had been around your level, that is a different story.  In either case,
you still get shroud experience.

Just for clerification, your shroud itself gets experience as well, so
I believe that the shroud exp would generally refer to the experience
the shroud gains, not the regular character.  However yes, when you
unshroud, any experience you have earned will go to AA, just like
exiting a monster mission.

I hear its a good idea to shroud to level 10 (15?) and have a druid
powerlevel you in Paludal if you really want to unlock other shrouds.
