I totally agree with you that many out there could stand a lesson in 
common courtesy. It sucks that we can't just all get along. There are 
some - on every server - that just require a GM to babysit them and make 
them play nice because they lack the level of maturity required for even 
the most basic conflict resolution capability. 

I'll save my views on when a camp should/should not be shared for another 
thread.

All in all though, I find FV to be a very enjoyable server.
