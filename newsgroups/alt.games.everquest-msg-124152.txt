Cleric level 5, you have DA, heal, stun, flash of light, root, gate, nuke...
from here on up you pretty much have most of your tool kit, just improvements

Cleric 29: Chain Stuns!

Cleric 34... Atone Atone Atone

Cleric level 54 when you get your pet at last

Cleric level 56 when people of your level stop looking around for better
rez before settling for yours

Cleric level 56 when you can finally stop memming those pesky heals,
just MOK and get on with fighting

Cleric level 60 when people your level stop looking around for better
buffs before settling for yours.

But I guess I'm forced to admit its really

Cleric 39 CHEAL baby!

59 cleric, not quite at "defining class" level yet
