I don't recall when it was, but alchemy potions were changed so they
no longer have a detrimental effect; they have only positive effects
now. 
I also believe they removed the need for folks to have a material
component for the potion to work.  Enduring breath potions do not
require the player to have fish scales for example.  Potions became
much more useful.
