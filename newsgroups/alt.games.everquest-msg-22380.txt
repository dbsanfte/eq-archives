Before I start, I want to point out that two things Verant did recently has
helped the Good Team on Sullon:  1) they added the Enchant precious metals
line of Enchanter spells in Felwithe.  2) they added the Missionaries of the
various Good dieties to give a very nice item to members of their religions
in exchange for a 5pp donation.

However.... the new rule about those under level 6 being able to be pk'd in
mid-to-high level adventure/travel zones is going to hyper-penalize the Good
Team.  It will complete the isolation of their two halves in Everfrost and
GFay.  Good newbie Erudites won't be able to take the boat to Qeynos.  Good
newbie Qeynosians won't be able to travel to Freeport or the GFay.  Goods
confined to Everfrost will have no more access to smithing or enchanting
supplies.

Already, the Good team is being outstripped in not only sheer numbers by the
Neutral and Evil teams, but also in levels, cash, equipment, and trade
skills.  I have seen many of my fellow Good Team members quit playing
Sullon, or switch from Good to the Neut or Evil Teams.  I've seen not only
individual Goods quit or switch, but entire guilds as well.

In the mean time, the Evils level and grow in power in peace as if Sullon
were a 'bluebee' or 'carebare' server for them, and the Neutrals work to
persecute the Good Team out of existence.  It also looks like the proposed
penalties that were being discussed to thin out the Evil team won't happen.

What can Verant do to offset the Good Team's massive disadvantages, so that
Sullon won't de facto become a two-team server?

Some ideas:

1).  Give all members of the Good Team an automatic bonus +10 save vs.
magic.  This will help offset the fact that most Good Team members don't
have the same access to cash and equipment as Neuts and Evils.

2).  Create a special Good-Only teleport system to link Everfrost, GFay, and
maybe Erudin and NFreeport, so newbie Goods aren't forever stuck in their
starting zones.  This will help offset the fact that many Goods in the
Everfrost area are cut off from their basic class trainers, quest sources,
trade supplies, and spell merchants (not to mention cut off from
reinforcements from other zones!)

2a).  Barring the Good-only teleport system....make smithing, caster, and
cleric supplies, trainers, and spells more readily available in Everfrost.
An 'exiled' monk trainer NPC in the Faydark might help, too.

These things won't be 'nerfing' or penalizing any of the other teams...it
will just go a little ways toward evening out the playing field just a bit.
It will help keep the Good Team from being overly frustrated, and entice
them not to switch teams or quit entirely.

There are many wonderful ideas on Sullon Zek, and it is a fun server to play
on.  There are many things there that Verant has done right.  I'm just
afraid that the normal challenges of playing a Good guy on a PvP server have
been accidently intensified on Sullon to the point that eventually, only the
rare individual will dare stay to fight on.
