And the mob "stacked" with the probable slaver was Rondo Dunfire a dwarven
rogue who hangs out in the slavemines.
He probably pickpockets the slaves of all the small change people give them
to get them to tell wich key unlocks them :)
And he drops Rondo Dunfire's tongue wich is part of a quest for the parrying
pick, to collect the tongues of the whole family Dunfire, of who
the rest of them (Crytil, Keldyn, and Barma) reside in Butcherblock
mountains.
