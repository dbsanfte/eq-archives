Why would this have to change in any way? It could just be adding
adding new slots. HeadModifier, Ear1Modifier, WaistModifier, etc. It
might even be a way to allow non-raid content to give
comparable-to-raid-level gear. That Barbed Ringmail may look a lot
more impressive when you've applied the +20 AC modifier, the +5 to all
saves modifier, and the Aura of Battle modifier

Again, why would this have to change? Modified equipment can be kept
server-side as easily as unmodified equipment.
