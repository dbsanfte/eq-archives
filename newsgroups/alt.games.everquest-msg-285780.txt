I only joined beta 4 but have been quite impressed so far - being able to
see for miles, having the choice of adventuring, crafting or running the
diplomacy quests has been great.  I think I'm addicted to diplomacy =)

I enjoy playing eq2 (still do) but I have found it to be more enjoyable in
that you can solo a bit more if you like, and be able to do the quests
rather than rely on people ( who may not be around) to help you.
Likewise the grouping is interesting - sharing quests is great, I liked that
aspect in CoV if you hadn't finished one and outlevelled it you could run it
with someone else.

Well better get back to it :)
