Been a good friend of the necros since he was a wee little druid...he
gets bored easily soloing and likes to have someone to talk to
(besides Gibtik of course).  Yeah, group buffs rock..being a ranger, I
have only one atm, and it's strictly attack, so I just make sure I
cast on myself first and immediately after on the necro so I know when
I need to hit him again.  Only one he has to ask me to refresh is
Strength of Nature, as it won't stack with my self only Warders
Protection.
