Well, I tried today to invite some non-pop people intop a raid and they
claimed to not be getting any invite.  So that would mean that all would
need PoP.  Granted we were sorta hunting stuff, so I didn't get to play with
it too much and barely anyone had PoP so I didn't even make a 2 person raid
successfully.
