Did one in Miragul's (first one I did live I think) with a
really good group.  We needed 30 and had 28 with 5 minutes
left, and 28 when we failed.  We continued on and cleared 
the dungeon - ended up with 32.  There were only *32* of the
things in the bloody dungeon, and the entire thing needed
to be cleared to guarantee success.

We simply don't accept collection missions now where we need
more than about 22 - the extra couple of minutes is well worth
not gettig screwed by the RNG.
