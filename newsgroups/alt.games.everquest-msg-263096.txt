Hi All;

I've just started playing in the OOW expansion. I won a Greater Mirumrite 
(sic) Rune. I understand that this is a level 69 spell.  The rune is NODROP. 
Does the spell turn in work similar to EP's and SP's in that, if I wanted a 
spell for another class, I could go to the spell turn in NPC for that class 
OR is it whoever holds the rune only gets the spell for his/her class with 
no chance to change to get another class's spell?

Thanks in advance for your help.
