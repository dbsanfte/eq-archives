Because a lot of the time you don't really want to cast one after the other.
And, "hit[ting] the button once and get back to other business" just isn't
very viable anyway.  What're you going to do after you hit the /cast /pause
/cast button?  You can't med, you can't reliably cast something else, and
you can't reliably run.  You might as well just hit it twice THEN go on with
the rest of your business.

If you're in a group where there's a warrior, cleric, and enchanter, who is
the most likely person to get an add (an unexpected critter addition) off of
the cleric?  The one who can taunt or the one who can mez?  "Warriors(tm),
Brains Not Included."

Will taunting the critter or healing an enchanter get a critter off the
enchanter faster?

What's a warrior's job?  To get hit and to kill.  The only tank I wouldn't
mind saving me is a pally (LH skill) and that's only once per game day.  All
others should concentrate on removing the current critter from existence so
that they can get to the add faster.
