I have to disagree with you on "2001: A Space Odyssey" IMNHO
Forbidden Planet was the Pinnacle of SFX, especially
considering when it was released in the 50's.  I mean look
at the schlock we had from, DR. Who (Okay, I know pretty
much all of Dr Who's effects were schlock from day one, to
infinity, I stilled loved it), the Original Star Trek, etc.
