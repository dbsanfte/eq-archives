I haven't noticed greifing, but there has been a slight jump in the
toon populatin in Zebuxoruk. I was starting a new toon on that
server recently, and suddenly glooming deep mines were full up with
around 20 new toons. I did wind up with several 'click-by-grouping'
demands and nothing said by /tell or /ooc... and a few adds to my
/ignore.
