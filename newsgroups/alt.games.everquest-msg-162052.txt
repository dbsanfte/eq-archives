I quit getting skill-ups long before that. If I'm good enough to make
them easily enough to not improve my skills by doing so, I should be
able to do better than 50% success. They trivial at 18. At nearly
double that skill level I should have better success rates. Their
formula is in question here, not the reality of it all.

Btw, I had a smith on another server up to 184 in smithing and still
barely managed a 60%-ish success rate on leather padding. Explain
that. So yeah, I have every right to complain.
