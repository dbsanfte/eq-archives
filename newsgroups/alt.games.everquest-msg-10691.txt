You silly silly person.  Posting binaries to a non binary group would be
very offensive, you should know that by now.  Both the map you
egregiously posted as well as my own personal observations clearly show
that the coordinates you mentioned were in fact not on the path at all
despite you claiming they were, but rather right next to the camp in
question.  I don't know why you insist on being hit over the head with
this fact again and again yet refuse to acknowledge it, that's between
you and your therapist.  Still,  the point remains, you should stop
posting things you make up based on info you're reading on web sites. 
Stick to things you actually know about from in game and you might get
by, insist on making things up based on information you can't understand
(like reading map coordinates) and you will continue to post
misinformation forcing me to point it out again and again lest some new
player foolishly think that you post helpful, accurate info here.  This
should be a place where folks can get good advice and information, its
not your own personal ego boosting facility.
