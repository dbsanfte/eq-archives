what are the chances of that EQemulator coming back?..that might be a 
good place to play. I never even knew it existed until people posted it 
was taken down so i don't know that much about it, or if it's even 
feasible. Heck if it's easy enough to do I would dedicate a comp and set 
it up for the people who wanted the old world.
