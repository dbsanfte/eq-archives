Thanks!

I looked up that spell, and it claims to do only about 16 points of damage.  Maybe that's right...
but it sure seemed like a lot more than that.  Maybe because we both were hasted, and dual
wielding... hmm... there's a thought.  The ranger can wield a 2HS... she ought to be using that
against these things - fewer attacks lead to less damage from the shield.

As a bard, I'm restricted to 1hb, 1hs, and piercing.  So maybe I'll hang back and chant it down.
At 38 (nearly 39) I can do a twist of Fufil's, Tuyen's, and Bellows.
