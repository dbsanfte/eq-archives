Armor...  nothing is more important to you for the next 54 levels than good
armor.   Always upgrade your armor.  It's better to have better armor than
better weapons (especially once you start grouping)

Armor AC and HP will keep you alive, and keep you from having to re-do
experience .  The less you get hit, the more damage you can do.

Beg for a velium 2hs or a velium 1hs or fine steel weapons in NFP or BB
(Never beg for platinum) usually, someone will give you a better weapon
within a few minutes.  But do not make a habit out of begging.  If you get
labeled as a beggar, itll follow you around till you quit EQ.

I would recommend working on getting banded armor.  It usually sells for 1pp
per AC.  (5-6 for legs, 6-7 for tunic, etc)

Another great way to get armor is to trade spider silks to tailors raising
their skill (in East Commons near freeport). Tell them you will give them
silks for 1 piece a patchwork or leather armor per stack.  Kill alot of
bats, and save the wings, people will buy them.


Good luck
