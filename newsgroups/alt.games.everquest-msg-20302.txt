To my experience they show in the alt.* heiarchy, and the lower down,
the more often. I suspect they point a news blaster at usenet, and
their pipe gets cut pretty quickly, thus the alphabetically low alt
groups see them more often. alt.games.* is pretty low on the list, and
get hit often. They seem to ignore the alt.binaries.* heiarchy, to get
them through the groups that are actially read.
