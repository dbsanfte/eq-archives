I wonder how difficult it would be to reprogram the /ignore function so 
it stops you from seeing the names over their heads, or even showing up 
in /who. That would be an acceptable stopgap measure, given that Sony 
have apparently entirely given up on policing names.

Speaking of which... Has any of you ever been in a situation where you 
felt like petitioning a guildie's name? What did you end up doing?
