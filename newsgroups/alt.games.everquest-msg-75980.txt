There is actually a lot you can do with fishing.
Requirements for Fishing: Fishing Pole (in main melee slot) and Bait of some
kind. Click on your Abilities Tab and select Fishing.
Now for the cool stuff (If you like to fish)...  What you catch is all
dependent on your skill level and what zone you are in.  The best zone is
Lake of Ill Omen.  You can catch different pounds of fish and even different
sizes.  Since a stack of bait only costs around 6 -8 sp you are catching
food that can be eaten.  If you ask me that's cheap food for just about five
minutes of time.

Also, Not a lot of people do it but you can also make your own lures:  You
need to buy a tackle box (four container, tiny), you can only buy it at a
vender in Feerott or in Ocean of Tears (Brother Island), this is also where
you can buy hooks (Circular, Dry, and Treble Hooks).  Combine a hook, some
silk thread and a type of wing with the final ingredient and then you have
your own bait!  They just made it so that you get a bonus using your own
lures.  Here are some recipes:
