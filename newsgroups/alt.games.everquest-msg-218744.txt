CHeal.
Resurrection.

At least, that's why we're keying them for Emperor and Vex Thal--to
raid with a guild that is 90% level 65.

At 55, I was plenty of healing for low-to-mid 60s groups in Plane of
Storms.

This is strictly to point out why clerics are far more useful in 65+
fights at 52 than tanks are. I have no problem with the seven-level
range for LDoN adventures.
