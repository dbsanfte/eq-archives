*shrug* "Donations" are optional in many instances in RL, I usually assume
they're either of the opinion that in THIS case it's optional, or they
forgot.  It doesn't happen often enough to worry about.  I'm still getting
used to standing there looking stupid until the client realizes I'm not
going to TRANSLOCATE them until AFTER they pay. <g>  I mean, my wizard is a
gnome...it's not like he's a stupid high elf.

"You're welcome."  If you said "your welcome" I'd say "my WHAT?"

BTW, I have a /r You're welcome =) hotkey.  Comes in handy when you're in
the habit of doing drive-bys.
