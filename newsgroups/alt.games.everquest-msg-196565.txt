Hmm, perhaps we were just lucky selecting that camp and trying pally lull.

I remember as a cleric complaining (in this newsgroup even) that there was
-no- more useful spell line in my book; resisted 3/4ths the time, and
3/4ths the time aggroed on resist, pulling the entire camp.  In fact the
only use I got out of it was to deliberately pull whole camps with it so I
could complain about how crazily it worked (sort of like begging hoping to
fail, as a taunt)
