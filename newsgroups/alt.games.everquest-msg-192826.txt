Isnt that just what your reply is?  Whining about the way someone else 
is whining?

Who are you to say what is constructive or not?  Is all a matter of 
perspective, one person may prefer you to be blunt, the other may wish 
you to pretty up the complaint.

Regardless of the situation, no metter how severe one or the other may 
be, it is still complaining.  Validity again is a matter of opinion.

Dude, your the only one who is taking whatever she said to heart. 
Easily offended, boy its easy to point out others 'bad' traits than it 
is to see the same in ourselves.

 From a totally unbiased 3rd person view, you need to calm down dude. 
Think before you type, and show the person the same respect you would 
expect for yourself.

And above all, remember, everyone is DIFFERENT.  We have different 
views, way of expressing ourselves, so we have to be tolerant of people 
that may not 'fit in' with the way that we are or are used to.

I myself took her post to be funny, nothing personal towards anyone.
