I tried around noon to get into the game and discovered that verant
was having power problems, no problem; went off and did something
else.

So roughly 12 hours later, 1am pst June 7, I go to log on and I can
log in, get to the server list, click on server, but instead of the
loading bar , I get a connecting to logon server screen that locks up
and requires alt-del-ctrl to get out of it. I tried this in three
different servers with the same result. EQ still down? Tried
connecting to chat, just would get the connecting to chat screen and
no farther. Looked at their network status trouble is only tells you
all servers are up and the post they have is a generic "some servers
are down for emergency repair",  which has no time stamp so you don't
know if that is meant for now, or left over from earlier today.

Wouldn't ask accept they also patched and that reeks havoc on the
firewall, requiring me to battle my way out of EQ to tell the Firewall
to allow EQ.exe to access net. Have had a rare problem or two related
to that and want to eliminate one or the other.

Thanks
