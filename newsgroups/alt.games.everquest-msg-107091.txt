Alright, silly ol' monk that I am, I can't find hide nor hair of these
banditos!  I've read they can be found in Field of Bones and Lake of Ill Omen
but I'm too scared to go much further than the guards.  Anyone know in which
of these two zones I'd have the best survival chance if I went lookin'?  And
what direction I should go to find these scalawags?

Thanks!
