Is a better explanation needed?  If it was made in the US then US Law
applies to its creation.  Then if it is not specifically illegal where you
are, or not well censored, then that would be all the explanation needed.

For the record, the very title offends my values, but it is better IMHO to
let idiots speak in public, the better to know who they are and how idiotic.
Further, censorship is a proverbial slippery slope: if we allow someone to
start, how will we know what we are missing?

Lawmaking is a subtle art; often outlawing an activity will make it happen
more often.  In the US, many drugs are contraband.  This lowers supply to
people who would kill to get the drug.  Addicts convert more addicts to sell
drugs to.  As price goes up, people make a year's wage in a few minutes.
Meanwhile, well intentioned police departments spend millions eliminating
the dealer's competition, raising the price still higher.
