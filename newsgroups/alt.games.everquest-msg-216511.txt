Every culture has its inhibitions. None of us are bonobo chimps. If I
had a choice, I would much rather my daughter live among the terribly
inhibited Americans than in the environment of modern Japan.

I have no problem with what any two or more consenting adults do
amongst themselves. I have serious issues with the parts of Japanese
culture that play hard and fast with consent.

Yes. Unwilling girls do get groped on American subways. But, it's an
aberration. If people see it happen, they will generally side with the
gropee and be glad to see the perpetrator brought to justice. That's
worlds different from Japanese chikan culture, where groping is
pandemic and victims are generally afraid to complain because the
general attitude is that it's their fault.

Perhaps you'd like to extoll the virtues of South African sexual mores
as better than our silly, Western inhibitions next.
