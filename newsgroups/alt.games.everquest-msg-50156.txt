Sounds like you are doing just fine for a level 5. Without "twinking",
your average "start from scratch caster" will usually only have enough
cash to buy some of thier new spells when they hit a new circle.

Bard mail delivery is one of the best lowbie quests, and can net you a
few gold per trip.

Cheers
