One: this would require the group leader to care about this
issue, instead of just the person who is curious.

Two: this would be a massive exp hit; you'd lose the group bonus
(about 216% normal exp) by being in Raid mode

I do think giving Raid Window level information to the Group
Window would be fantastic, I love color coding classes which lets
me figure out the general form of whats going on at a glance, and
find taping a little post it note of level and class next to the
group window quite cumbersome.  Now that I'm playing on FV, where
80% of players are anon or roleplay, and at least 50% are evasive
when asked their class and level even in the most "rolespeak"
way, this is even more annoying.

Splendid
