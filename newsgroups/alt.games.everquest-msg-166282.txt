The weakest of the weak were light blue at 53.  Most are still dark
blue at 55.  And that's fighting mostly near the entrance.  They do
seem to get tougher, on average, deeper in, but they definitely were
already starting to go light blue at 53, and I saw more light blues
at 54 than I did at 53.  Nice to know there're still plenty of blues
for a 55 deeper in tho.
