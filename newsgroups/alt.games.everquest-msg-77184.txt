No, they dumped millions of investor dollars into these sites, based on an 
ad-based revenue model that no longer applies.  If they don't get ad 
revenue anymore, and they don't get revenue from users, where does it come 
from?
As someone with 5 years experience in managing large, commercial backbones 
and hosting environments, I think I'm pretty well qualified to speak on 
the costs of something like EZBoard.  I'm sure that in your vast 
experience working with large-scale hosting environments you've found the 
way to do it for 1/10th the cost of the rest of the world.  Please share 
your knowledge with us so that we can all be all-knowing and wise.
