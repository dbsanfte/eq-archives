Here it is after adjusting for everyone's caveats.  Once again, this is
Tanking as defined by me, which means the ability be main tank, I.E.
stand in front and take (or abate) all the hits, and stay alive the
longest, with healing... basicly think raid MT as being best, and go
down from there to tanking in an XP group, to tanking greens to farm
em...

Plate Wearin' TANKS!:
1 Warrior
2/3 Shadowknight / Paladin

A lot of people said Paladins were better than SK's but seemed like just
as many agreed with me here, so I'll make them tied for 2nd & 3rd place.

Mele Types: 

4 Ranger
5 Beastlord
6 Monk
7 Rogue

I still have trouble believing ranger is anywhere near as good as a
monk, but I'll take your word for it.  Also not sure I shouldn't put
rogue down there below the cleric.

Classes that can barely tank, but really shouldn't:

8 Cleric
9 Bard
10 Shaman
11 Necromancer

Still not too sure on Necromancers, they've got some strange tricks up
their sleves (that I'm not familiar with).  And there's some Mele
Clerics out there as well especially after 56th lv.

Pussy Non-Tanking Classes, Shouldn't even tank greens, Run AWAY! and
kill em from afar!

12 Enchanter
13 Wizard
14 Druid
15 Mage

Mages used to be able to use their pets to tank, but this is only
usefull now if you have no mele types, because mobs always PC > pet.
