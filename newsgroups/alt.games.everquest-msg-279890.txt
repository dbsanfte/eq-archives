I think the guild bank is for tradeskill components not the items. Not
positive.
I do like WoW's way of dealing with equipment and tradeskilling but more
limits in skill would be better. WoW has trivial caps at level 10 20 40 for
example.

Tradeskilling does compound the Rumblevision but if no one is in skillup
race then hopefully not an issue.
