Some time before EQ was released, there were one or two trailers circulated
around the net.  I remember watching one of them; probably the first one
ever released.  It played a variation on the Kaladim music - that is, the
music you hear in Butcherblock Mountains just outside Kaladim.

I no longer play EQ, but one of my fond memories of the game centers around
its music.  The expansions were bitterly disappointing in their support of
this facet of the overall experience.

Anyway, basically I'm on the hunt for links to this trailer.  I haven't had
any luck, really.  There is one clearly old trailer floating around out
there, fairly common.  It doesn't play music from the game.  Instead, it
plays some sort of bouncy new age tune with a female vocalist.  Quite lame.

If anyone knows of a working link, I'd appreciate the info.  Thanks.
