Dont know about anyone else..but i when i got this message after patching i
was steamed.. the blasted game was working fine the nite before and i
changed nothing since. Only diff was the cursed patch. So i go to
everquest.com and find the Luclin "fix" for this problem.. Deleted all
Luclin files and start over...HA..to hell with that.
They also said to try moving some files around. but but but. why now.
nothing moved since last nite. why did it work for 5days with Luclin then
stop....
Then i recalled the one thing different i tried from pre patch.... I had put
a check in the "autoplay" box. soon as i unchecked that "feature" i didnt
have the cant find Luclin error message....Any one else with that error
message have this checked? I got a yes from the ones in my guild that had
the error when i asked them.
feel sorry for those of you that deleted and reinstalled or moved a bunch of
stuff...
