Huh?  35 isn't much worse than 30.  Here's the XP a human cleric needs
to complete various levels:

        28      2.3 million
        29      2.4 million
        30      5.3 million <-- hell level
        31      3.1 million
        32      3.3 million
        34      3.7 million
        35      8.2 million <-- hell level
        36      4.5 million
        37      4.8 million
        38      5.1 million
        39      5.3 million
        40     12.0 million <-- hell level
        41      6.4 million
        42      6.7 million
        43      7.0 million
        44      7.4 million
        45     16.8 million <-- hell level
        46      8.7 million
        47      9.1 million
        48      9.5 million
        49      9.9 million
        50     10.3 million
        51     24.0 million
        52     26.0 million
        53     28.1 million
        54     46.1 million
        55     50.2 million
        56     54.5 million
        57     59.1 million
        58     63.8 million
        59     89.3 million <-- hell level
        60     53.5 million

(Note: I've seen different multipliers given for the 50+ levels, so the
above may be off for 51 and above).

30 is 2.2 times the XP of 29.
35 is 2.2 times the XP of 34.
40 is 2.8 times the XP of 39.
45 is 2.3 times the XP of 44.

BTW, avoid dying in the level *after* a hell level.  The death penalty
is a fixed percentage of what it takes a human warrior to complete the
*previous* level.  This means a death in 41, say, costs 1.9 times as
much XP as a death in 42.
