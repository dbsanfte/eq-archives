Even though im a level 32 war, I was just bumbling around the world and
wanted to check out The Warrens...

I had a char on SZ that played in the Warrens A LITTLE and he has seen red
con people that look very strong be wasted by some things...Anyhow

My warrior was in there and luckily I decided to the right first (The Prince
area) I was conning EVERYTHING left and right because I was scared something
might be a higher level then me...I eventually made it to the prince with
absolutely nothing aggroing on me. I see him start to cast a spell, harm
touch 180 dmg =p

I procede to whamp on him like its no ones business...A teen zoned in (18)
and was telling me more. He explained the seprate ends of the warrens, the
king side and prince side. I got up some guts and went to the king
area...Yet he told me the king was around level 32 (gasp my level!) and had
a shaman with him. He also told me he saw or heard a level 42 war died by
something else in there...I never did go very far in there heh still scared
I will be crushed by some ubber kobold.
