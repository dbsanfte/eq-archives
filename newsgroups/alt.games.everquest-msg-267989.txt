I've had weird results with the filters. I have 2 windows, and one is just
for tells and ooc. I periodically find that the tick for it disappears so
that i'll type something ooc and will notice it doesn't appear in either
window, and i have to re-check the box. I bugged it but i had trouble
accurately describing it and it's intermittent which means it can be
terribly hard to fix.

I have problems with the waypoints too; i can't initiate one but if i die,
it works fine. I get the message about the glowing trail when i click on
things on the map, but otherwise nada.

I bought a basic harvesting item which didn't seem to make any difference.
At least now i know why. Argh, that was a lot of cash for me at the start.
I'm hoping to find some way to make a profit crafting, but so far it's a
loss. Prisitine items sell for the same price to vendors as lousy ones.
Anyone know if you can make a profit crafting to sell to vendors? I doubt
i'll ever be able to setup a market like i did in SWG or the bazaar and make
money that way, the eq2 situation seems like the worst of both systems.

Eski the ever overloaded,
