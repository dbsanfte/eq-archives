That's not quite correct.  Mythic has asked what the players think, and said
that if the majority wants it, they will try it out, because they think
they've got enough anti-cheating protection in place that it would be safe.

That rumor is silly.  The most Microsoft would be able to do is threaten to
not allow distribution of Microsoft software with applications that much
with alt-tab, so that EQ and DAoC could not include the DirectX runtime on
their CDs.  They could also slip into the latest security update or fix
something that breaks EQ and DAoC.

However, if MS pulled that crap with Sony, Sony would *crush* Microsoft.
Microsoft has been legally determined to be have a monopoly.  Sure, they got
off easy on the punishment, but that doesn't erase the finding of monopoly,
and if anyone else sues Microsoft under antitrust law, they get to use that
result.  They don't have to establish all over that MS has a monopoly.  It
goes straight to the prove-harm-and-figure-damages-and-punishment phase.
