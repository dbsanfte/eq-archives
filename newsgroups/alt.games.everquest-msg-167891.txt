From my *experience*  the taunter is able to...

I have kept mobs perma mezzed for long durations and been the slower, we're
talking a lot of hate. The Taunter in my group has never had trouble gaining
the agro before breaking the mez.

If I wanted to help in this regard I would and do use the Visage line of
spells, not mem blur which can take several attempts to get to stick (if it
sticks at all). And I would only use these spells on higher end mobs not
pure  xp grinding...
