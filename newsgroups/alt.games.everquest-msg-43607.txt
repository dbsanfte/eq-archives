Duly noted. :-p

They say they will. I think they will. How much they can is anyone's
guess. I can only describe what is in now and what they say, my
crystal ball is on the fritz. :-(

For melees there are quite a few. But for casters... its more a matter
of knowing when its safe to cast, when you're in a group. Sort of like
wizards nuking or necros dotting - gotta know when to hold back.
