I agree here, I'd rather have paid the old 600 and gotten
the same pet only not suicidal; as a cleric I have buffs that
can overcome the 100hp problem pretty nicely, but its
hard to apply while he's tanking for me, and wasteful
to do so when he's so short lived.

Any thing that made UHOF more usable, though, was
very welcome to me.

Fun eh?

Yep, and farming is a major part of the game if you want to
indulge in trade skilling or just to buy some better gear (read
participate in the player economy)... HGs are for most classes
the best risk/reward way of generating cash, but never really
have been for clerics, now I bet they are for us too.

Are you sure?  UHOF, even for a "sit and med" cleric, means
tossing in another what, 20DPS for very little mana cost, even
less mana cost if you get clever at moving the hammer to the
next mob and the next mob (root parked mobs work better
here than mezed ones, mind you).  While this used to be the
mark of a cleric facing FM and a magic resistant mob with
a lot of HP, now its worth casting on any mob thats going to
live at least a minute.  Get an Enshrouded Veil and the mana
cost is comperable to a Remedy per fight...
