Bard, Bard, Bard, BARD!!!!
He's in GFay, Bard gets corpse location song at L8, IIRC.  Wood Elves
and Half Elves can be Bards.

But not if it's a Bard!  :)
Don't forget that it's a reasonable courtesy to offer a small token
of your esteem to somebody who helps you out of a jam like this.  At
your level 1pp or so would not be unreasonable.

Chipped Bone Rod, 10ish pp, three charges.  Vendor on Bank platform
in Kelethin sells them.

P.S.  If you can't find a Bard, there are often plenty (read way too
many) of Gnome Necros (possibly SKs nowadays?) in GFay.  One of them
might be willing to help if you don't find a nice Elf Bard to help
you.
