I've given up trying to workout what SOE are doing with the
supposedly English language EU servers. I mean, first off Runnyeye was
the only server and marked as so, however a few days after launch the
label was taken off. I assume because it was so overloaded SOE hoped
removing the label would stop people making chars there. It didn't,
so they split the server three ways and after much complaining gave us
a true English EU server in Amsterdam with the same patch times as the
other servers there. Only it now seems that's not the case and
Splitpaw is on the same patch times as the US and somehow Runnyeye is
now marked again as an EU server.

Personally, though a 12pm patch time doesn't affect me. During the
week I'm at work and at weekends having just got out of bed I
shouldn't be playing games but be doing other things like getting
dressed or making lunch!!
