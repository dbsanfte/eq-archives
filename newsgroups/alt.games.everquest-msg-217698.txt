The points seem to be on an exponential scale with respect to average 
level (at least it's definitely not linear).  In an all 65 group, every 
member get 51 points.  In a 60ish group, I got I think 34 points as a 
level 65 (most of the rest of the group was 58-61).  In a mid-50s group, 
it's down to 20ish points per successful adventure.  From what I hear 
even for high 20s groups you're only getting 2 or 3 points per adventure.  
So 5 or so in the low 30s sounds about right.
