Graeme & Archerbear have already hit the main points, but I'd like to
stress how useful I've found Intellectual Superiority to be.  Most people
think that it is strictly a fizzle reducer, but because it raises your
casting
level by 6 it is almost as if you are casting 6 levels higher.  If you look
at
your nukes, they hit harder (just a few points, but it means the spell is
working).  I personally like to cast it on myself and on any casters whose
success is dependant on spells landing on critters (Wizards, Necro,
Paladin, SK, etc...)

Also, I found that with a CHA around 150 ish I didn't agro too much
from failed Pacifies (never used calm/lull).  Always go with your highest
calm spell even if its a mana hog!

ps. Always calm the critter you are pulling too!
