(Wrote reccomendations first) looks like you should hang out in the
Eastern Wastes, half the stuff I reccomend comes from there.  For
Brell's sake make friends with some enchanters, you'll need em
more and more as you level up anyway, the fact that many of them
are jewelers is a bonus.

There are better one hand blunts out there for a cleric,
but this isn't your priority by any means

Not familiar with this one, you should be able to get
a charred guardian shield by now... I'm a 2hb weilder
myself, so I'm not even close to an expert on shields
or books.

The third coldain shawl quest will yield you a seal that
goes here, -much- better than this eye.  You don't need
to do steps one and two to get it, either, and unless you
are seriously planning to go on to at least step 6 if not 7,
I wouldn't bother with the shawl.

Loops are decent for quite a while longer, I'd not
worry about your ears at the moment

Here's where you plunk your cash; get a platinum viel
at least, velium is relatively speaking a waste of cash,
but you should be able to get plat ruby for between
500 and 1000 depending on the jeweler

Adamantine Epoletes, drop off the cavalier in LGuk
relatively common.  If you really don't feel like
hunting for them yourself (and why not?  LGuk is
all undead targets if you haven't moshed your
live froggie faction, cleric paradise) you can probably
buy this for 100pp.

Silver again?  Hard to imagine wearing silver stuff at 40,
how broke are you?  You should be fast chums with
any number of enchanters by now and expect to get this
stuff at cost... Clerics are the most important thing in
an enchanter's life, just as enchanters are the most important
things in a cleric's life!

WHAT?  Get yourself the cleric gold quest bracers
quick.  I did this solo at level 30.  AC 9 wis 5, you just
won't be able to beat this, even with Planar (just got
a Hate bracer, AC 9, and dex/cha of all things, as if
I give a rat sandwich about those stats!  OK, so its
also plus mana, if my wis was over 200 without the
gold I guess I'd wear the purple...

Ulthork hide bracers are easily looted at your level,
although you might be better off with the FP for AC,
depends on your mana pool and how much you
rely on AC

> Chest:                      Bloodstained Tunic

Lots of better stuff out there, how about the rygorr
battle mail, always drops off the chief in the rygorr
fort; he's nearby and you are of a level for a group
to take that camp on.

Just can't imagine bronze in your fourties, what are
you doing, relying on autosplit for all your looting
cash?  Drop wis boots are quite rare, so either
buy FS plate ones, do your cleric gold quest ( I think
I did it at 10th) or look around for other handy
footwear options in whatever zone you are lurking
in.

With a good group you can do the Kromiff Military Leggins
quest, a good deal better than the FS plate

How about the Guantlets of the Black, drop off Firebrand
in the RyGorr fort?  Be a while before you find anything
to beat them, and they are the common drop off this guy,
plus you'll be camping the fort anyway for that battlemail.
