But then they might actually (gasp) do damage when
trying to hit me!  Eeek, 15 points!

As an aside, I'll mention that a bixie once killed me
when I went AFK in WC at 35th level... one of my kids
had broken a glass and got cut.  I got back from taking
care of things about 30 minutes later, just in time to see
the dreaded Load Please Wait message.
Scrolling back, I was unable to find the point at which
the bixie had started, it had litterally scrolled off
the list buried in "hit for one point" messages... and I
have "other's misses" off!
