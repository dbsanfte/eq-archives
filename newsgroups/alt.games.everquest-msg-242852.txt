Good day-

I started a halfling rogue- having some fun

I was fortunate enought to loot one of the skele commanders. (PLEASE
STOP THE SKELE INVASION IN NEWBIE ZONES!!) anyway- I got a great bow. 
Catch is I have no arrows.

After going around a few fletching vendors- I can't find arrows- only
the components.  Am I stuck making my own arrows, do vendors sell
them.

I imagine they are sold in the bazaar, but what should I expect to pay
for basic arrows.  I'm on Brell Serilis.

BTW- I'm still looking for a guild- I play a lot and have a lvl 19
shamy who will do what he can.

Thanks
Armin
