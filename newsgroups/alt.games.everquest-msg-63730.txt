well not really a bug more like a typo but it can prevent drivers from
installing properly

Basically
when you follow this link
http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/compatability_matrix.jsp

you get a selection of drivers for various graphics cards that are supposed
to work with luclin and dx8 I think anyway on installing the V3 win2k vsa
drivers a certain file was missing called 3dfxspl2.dll

on exploring the cabs I found a file called 3sfxspl2.dll and since all the
other files are called 3dfxxx.xxx I guess some idiot at veraint accidentally
hit the "s" key instead of the "d".

I used winrar to extract the cab corrected the typo and gave windows the
location of the said file seems to work fine now I just thought I'd mention
my findings in case anyone else was haveing trouble installing the drivers

also how do I tell verant of the dumb mistake if someone could post
something on the forums I'd appreciate it
