Type 'IDKFA'.  And, if you really want to spray fire everywhere, get ahold 
of a utility called dehacked.  You can use it to lower the delay on all 
the doom weapons, and to change the amount of ammo you can carry.

Then, if you're feeling silly, there was a patch somewhere called 'chooka' 
that would replace your rocket launcher with an exploding chicken 
launcher.

'Bkwaaawk... boom!' Oh, I love that. :)
