Hmm by 17th level flame lick wasn't really doing a great deal of damage
for me - its main advantage is that AC debuff is still useful to you and
presumably the other fighters. Its Ok to use it, but cautiously once
the tank has got good aggro from the mob - thats the change from soling
you need to note.
Burst of Fire will be handy damage for you, if you have Flamelicked though
its adding a fair amount of hate and probably enough to get the attention 
fromthe mob. If you havent done flame lick or snare you may find you can
get away with using this reasonably often to assist the damage per second
though.
Restraint is OK to a certain point and then you can fire away....

Its not so much that archery on the whole is useless until high level, but
that specifically in a group it isnt a great deal of use until then. 

You will want your bow for soloing when its quite handy until you can fear
kite...hard mobs you root park and then shoot away to bring them to a
level you can survive the hand to hand.

Pretty much for groups. Get the role the group want you in, stick to it.
