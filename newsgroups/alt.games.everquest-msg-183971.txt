Hmmm.  Skill, as I have heard/seen it used since childhood, refers
to techniques that require practice, like using a tennis racket,
swinging a golf club, flying a kite, playing a musical instrument,
& etc.  The knowledge of which particular technique(s) to apply in
which circumstances has always been something that distinguishes
the master from the expert from the merely skilled, rather than
being considered a part of the master's/expert's skill.

Still, I'm open to argument, can you give an example or two of
the "Skill, in the form of game knowledge" that you're referring to?
