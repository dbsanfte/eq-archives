I disagree with you.  If you are planning on skilling past 200 in a trade
skill, having a tradeskill stat as high as possible, with 255 being the
minimum of what I would consider to be acceptable, is hugely important for
saving time and money.  This applies even more so if you are doing Smithing.
Its such a PITA I would want the absolute best chance possible at a skill
raise if it meant saving me some combines.
