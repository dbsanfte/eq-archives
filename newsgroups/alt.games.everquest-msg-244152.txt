well, i finally got my tailoring skill up high enough that most bags are
green and backpacks are yellow.  i find that i can sell a backpack for
40-50pp, but the large bag does not sell at all.  what price should i ask
for a tailored large bag on the FV server?  is it even possible to sell one?

also, how much does a tailored quiver usually sell for?  i've seen some
people ask as much as 50pp, but today i heard someone say that he could
barely sell one for 10pp.  so are they easy to sell or not!?!
