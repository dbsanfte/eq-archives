Generally speaking, most druids have no problems dropping a SoW on
somebody if they run up and ask.  Me personally, I don't have a
problem with "plz".  Not everybody is a decent typist and they develop
shortcuts.  I can appreciate and understand why some people don't like
it though.

Have you ever popped up at the druid ring in WC and had FIVE people
run up to you asking for SoW, Regen, and a port?  Or just zoom by a
group and suddenly receive a tell 'sow us'.  It grates.  After a while
the most innocuous SoW request will make one cringe.
