Focus items up until now were for pet casting classes.
They allowed you to summon a slightly more powerful
Pet. Not a higher level one, just one with stronger stats.

And look under focus items for a general idea of what
they did.

The newer focus items is anyone's guess what they do.

I suspect that the less powerful ones may just reduce
fizzle rate and increase things like channeling skill or
specialization skill.

The more powerful ones could increase spell effects
like, damage, range, casting time, hp healed, re-cast time, etc.

Perhaps even for the most powerful ones to decrease
the resistance check.

It would be sweet if they added a caster focus to the Cadeusus
of the Sacrament for the Temple of Ro Cleric weapon quest.
So it would actually be worth going after! =)
