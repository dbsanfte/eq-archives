Maybe other Gossamer items?
I've tried looking for them, but the Gossamer drops are extremely rare. In
all my 36 levels I just have a cap, robe, sleeves and leggings. The robe
from Befallen and the other 3 from Runnyeye.

btw. Try the Advisor Robe if you ever get to it. I think that one just looks
damn cool on me.
