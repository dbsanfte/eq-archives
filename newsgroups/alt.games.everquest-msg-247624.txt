As a cleric, I lead off with a root. That doesnt do any damage, and I 
get kSd frequently. What is my other option...nuke it and hope I can get 
a root off while it is pounding on me?

I have a hotkey I made long ago /ooc I got dibs on a %t - ROOTING it now.

It mostly works, though I have been told rooting doesnt count, damage is 
what counts=\
