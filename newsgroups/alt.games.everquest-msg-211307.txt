Nope, no Canni V here.  MGB is one AA away, then, for Canni V, I need MC2 
and MC3 first, then Canni V, so 15 AA for that one.  I found that the 
annoyance factor of very slow movement when I was living off of soloing 
in PoN at the time meant I was getting hit a whole lot more.  For my 
other soloing, I was largely hitting indoor zones, so, again, the mount 
was useless.

Against the General in particular, the mount would have been handy during 
the fight, but, not that huge a deal, as I spent most of the fight canni 
dancing, and keeping my pet alive.  It might have worked out better for 
me to be mounted and letting the general hit me, not sure, he hits hard, 
and I have only ever been able to disease slow him (50%).

I expect I will purchase one again, but, right now, I still need one more 
group buff spell that I can't afford, that will be very handy on raids, 
and usually sells for 7 to 8k on EMarr.  Talisman of the Boar.
