I'm sure some of it is just the fact that WoW hasn't been around as
long.  And part of it is that Blizzard did a good job of making the
classes unique, which makes playing alts more attractive, just like
they managed to make the different races very unique in Starcraft.

Even with two level 70s I still sometimes get surprised by the
abilities of my comrades.  I'm sure over the next few years I'm going
to be spending time with a lot of lower level chars, just to see how
their classes play.
