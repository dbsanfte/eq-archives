Rangers are great fun.

Agi is useless. Do not be deceived. Agi is useless. Useless. Do not
start rumours. Agi bad. No want agi.

You dont really say what level you are, but a Fungi is hands down the
best bet for a mid level ranger. Its still useful at 65. Other than that
a very fast pony is fun, but you're talking 100k, not 30. A tolans 
breastplate might be 30kish now the POK gate necks are about and
that really is a godsend for a ranger of any level that can click it.

>so what are the toys that are so much fun that you folks have enjoyed?

Holgresh elder beads, but again, possibly too expensive.
