I don't play a monk and my highest character is only 33rd.  However, I
do find it interesting that Sony said the monk nerf didn't work as
intended but then didn't back it out.

They should have immediately fallen back and gone back to the drawing
board instead of pissing off a whole class of customers.

The best thing to do is to vote with your wallet and let Sony know why
- heck write the CEO, attaching Sony's statements from their patch
that the monk change didn't work properly.  If enough customers did
this, things would happen quickly - money talks.
