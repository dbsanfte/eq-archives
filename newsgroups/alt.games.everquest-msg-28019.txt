Bards don't do a respectable amount of damage...that's like saying shaman do
(melee-wise). :)

Sure, enchanters are great to buff, then get the hell out of the way.  Don't
think I'm anti-enchanter...mine is level 52.  I've just seen the future, and
I have a very minor role in it.  When many of the enchanter epic parts are
preferably done without much help from an enchanter, that kinda proves the
case.

And yes, Jaz, enchanters are the mana thieves.  I have 2 spells that suck
mana from a caster and gives it to me, plus one that just steals mana from
the critter.  And yes, that would be a viable use of an enchanter as long as
he's not stupid enough to cast tashan within the first minute (insta-death
on any 51+ critter).

BUT, when it comes to xp groups it's clerics, enchanters, then anyone
else...so it balances. :)
