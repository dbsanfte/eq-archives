First, this is not a flame.  I am not contradicting Dan. These are just
my thoughts on the subject.

Why is that?
You say begged, not beggad.
You say begging, not beggang.
According to Merriam-Webster, the proper spelling is _beggar_.

But also, they say that the '-er' is used as a noun suffix to indicate a
person occupationally connected with the noun.
So, by Merriam-Webster own rules of english(1), you can make the word
begger by adding the '-er' to the base noun.

Even the word beggar has one of its roots(2) in the word _beggere_.

We complain a lot about broken/bugged parts of the game(eq).
Why don't we complain more about the broken/bugged English language?
The English language (as used by the Americans at least) has many rules.
Why are so many of them broken?
Why do we put up with a broken language when we wouldn't accept the same
bug in a game?

What's wrong with using the word _begger_?  
New words appear in languages all the time.
Old words get new meanings.
New words get old meanings.
As words and meanings change, dictionaries change.
If change is normal, why do we complain about it?

Maybe _begger_ is a word from one of the Norrathian languages.
Do we have any Norrathian dictionaries?

Words are created by the people, used by the people, and slaughtered by
the people.  
But it's our language.  I say we can make it what ever we want it to be.

POWER TO THE PEOPLE.

Now, if you really want a broken part of the English/American language
to talk about, the letters 'C', 'Q', and 'X' are useless.  They has no
sound of their own.  They are an impersonators.
