The life of a lowbie mage - lol.  For me it was protecting that pet
that I had resummoned for max level and given a sword from Hallerd's
worth a couple of GP :)  At level 8, some one I was selling HQ pelts
to dropped a mithril quill on me as a gift - the extra HP was quite
welcome.  I was fortunate to have tanked as much as I did early, because
it puts you in good position to max your defense before you get
to a level where you aren't typically symboled yet but mobs can 
tear you apart in a couple of rounds (Sabertooth Tigers in OT in
my mid 30's)
