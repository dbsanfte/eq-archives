Nothing I've ever noticed. But, get a good map or you'll be good and
lost.

Once you can backstab, use the one with the highest damage in your
main hand. If you can, you should off-hand a good 1hs or 1hb weapon
because decent-ratio weapons in those categories are much less
expensive than comparable piercers. (i.e. Centi Short Sword.)
