That all sounds great except for the fact that it reduces the game to 
four functional classes, really. Maybe that's what bothers me. I *like* 
the wide variety of classes in EQL. I'm only affected by their 
shortcomings as exaggerated/dramatized and perpetuated popular opinion 
dictates.

Sure, you might say that these games basically only involve four roles 
to begin with (dealing damage, taking damage, healing damage, crowd 
control), but EQL allows you to select a class that can excel at more 
than one or even more of those. You have classes that are better at 
pulling (I miss mob splitting), buffing, de-buffing, sneaking or other 
highly useful spells of utility.

Balancing such a wide range of classes it a monumental task, to be sure, 
but only when utmost priority is placed on doing so, as opposed to just 
getting it pretty darn close and letting the game be played as a fantasy 
role-playing experience as opposed to a min-maxxing competition.

That's because it is so generic. It almost feels like they've sold EQ's 
soul to please the vocal masses.

That's certainly undesirable. However, they may have gone to the other 
extreme with EQ2 - making sure class doesn't matter.
