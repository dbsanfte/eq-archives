got a little bit creative and expanded on our guild chat. Some
guildies told me to post it here.

I'm too uber for sash, too uber for my sash 
it aint worth that much cash 
And I'm too uber for my plate, too uber for my plate 
it drops regularly in hate 
And I'm too uber for my boots, too uber for my boots 
cant right click grasping roots 

I'm a twinkie, you know what I mean 
and I do my little turn in the guild chat 
Yeah, in the guild chat, in the guild chat, yeah

I'm too uber for this zone, to uber for this zone 
I like to hunt alone 
And I'm too uber for a group, to uber for a group 
I just want all the loot 
And I'm to uber for that buff, too uber for that buff 
Aegolism is *just* enough 

Coz I'm a twinkie, you know what I mean 
and I do my little turn in the guild chat 
Yeah, in the guild chat, in the guild chat, yeah 
I do my little turn in guild chat
