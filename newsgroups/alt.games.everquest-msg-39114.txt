1.  Corpse bugging (die close to a wall and you're corpse is bugged,
need either a corpse summon which can only be done at the zone in or
you need a guide/GM intervention which can take HOURS).

2.  Pathing node warp.  Let a wurm run, even snared, rather than
running it will simple "warp" to the next pathing node which is
usually WAY THE FUCK down the hall near a few other drakes/wurms.
This is instant and can't be interrupted.

3.  Drake wall warp.  Push a drake into the wall, push it far enough
(say with 20 meleers beating the snot out of it) and it will "warp" to
it's spawn point and be healed about 30% of it's health.  This is NOT
an instance of gating.  They will then proceed to summon people one at
a time while spreading their aggro to their friends around them.  So
not only do you have people getting summoned to a VERY difficult spot
to drag from, you have every mob near that drake headed to you at SoW
speed.

4.  Insta-warping when aggro is lost.  Attempt to FD pull, if it's a
wurm or dragon, instead of "walking" back, it will warp back.  You can
verify this by using tracking.  One second they are on tracking, next
they are gone.  

These are the joys of Temple of Veeshan.

Oh yeah, did I forget to mention that because this ONE zone has three
distinct hunting spots (West, East and North), you can have upto three
raids going on at the same time?  Of course, the problem is that when
you have three full blown raids at the same time, you can easily have
150+ people in the same god damn zone!  Combine this with practically
every mob being able to AoE and you have some serious "fun".

ToV is a challenge alright...most of that challenge has NOTHING to do
with mob difficulty though.
