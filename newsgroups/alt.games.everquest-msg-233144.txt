I don't really buy it, either. "D00dz" are constantly making up
stories to link their lingo to more "l33t" origins to try to
legitimize it to some degree. They're in denial of the fact that, no
matter how you slice it, using l33t makes people look like idiots (the
exception being when it's used in a joking/ironic manner).
