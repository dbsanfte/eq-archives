One thought I had is that there are certain items where the price is 
ludicrously low, because either vendors won't take the item at all, or 
because they offer almost nothing.

If you have an item which you think might sell for 1000pp, and a vendor 
will pay 900pp, you keep it at 1000pp for a while and then dump it for 
the 900.  But if the vendor only pays 9pp, then you drop the price down 
and down and down till you're selling it for 50pp if thats what it takes.

Raise what the vendor will pay up to 900pp, and you won't be selling it 
for 10,000pp, because you couldn't even find a buyer for it at 1000pp. 
What will happen is you'll sell it for 900pp, thus keeping it out of the 
hands of the guy with only 50pp to his name.

In other words, the idea would be to set a minimum price for items, so 
they don't get dumped for chump change, rather than to raise the price 
that people get for items that are actually valuable to comperably 
leveled people.

Not sure it would work, and I explain why at length in my post, but 
maybe this variation would do better.
