I did that myself when I noticed how much the events in the US are
taking attention away from our current government, which lost many
parliamental seats after the elections on Monday and are expected to
have to leave once the opposition sorts itself out. My observation was
that our current PM probably did it. (Yes, I have a black sense of
humor at times, why do you ask?)

I refuse to believe they realize the full scale of what they are
cheering for.

Sure. I'm 4000 miles from the US. I'll even cook you some Chinese food
