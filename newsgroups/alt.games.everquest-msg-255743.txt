I would like to announce a new contest that MMO Addict (www.mmoaddict.com)
is having. We are going to give away a free massively multiplayer game or
game card of your choice at or under the retail price of $39.99 USD. In
order to win you must submit the best screenshot of any massively
multiplayer game that has either been released or in beta. If you submit a
screenshot of a game that is still in beta, it may not be under a
non-disclosure agreement.

All screenshots submitted must meet the following requirements in order to
be accepted in the contest:
� JPG Format
� No Smaller Than 800 x 600 In Size
� Full Quality
� No Character Names (Only Monster Names)

If you want to submit a screenshot for the contest, please attach it in a
reply to the forum thread located at
http://forums.mmoaddict.com/showthread.php?t=321. The contest will end on
August 31, 2004 and the winner will be announced on the forums. If you have
any questions, please feel free to contact me.
