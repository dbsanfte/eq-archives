Another condsideration is that I found that I had, sometime in the past, or 
when I reduced my video settings in order to play on dial up, no longer had 
maps available in places like PoK, Karnor's Castle, West Freeport, Shar Vahl 
and other well known places that I had used maps before.  Turns out that I 
needed to press the Height/Lables/Base 1 buttons and voila!! my maps are 
back to normal... and I can now see again...

With the TSS expansion, however, the book is not on the map... I had to edit 
it in... and save of course.

Just my 2cp
