Hrmmm... Perhaps I should start working on Fippy again.

Fippy (when told to fetch) would go grab your logs via SMB and split them 
into single-day chunks, in dynamically generated directories based on 
character name and server (thus in ./data/71/Wasain, in my case (71 being 
Drinals number)). It is not a parser, but rather a splitter and manager.

I also had plans to teach Fippy to merge Friends lists and keep them 
consistent across all your characters, as well keeping UI settings the same 
for all characters too (if you want that, of course)
