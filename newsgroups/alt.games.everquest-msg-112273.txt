Well, my take on it is that bard is probably another specialize and
maybe an unmentioned one like the thief path. If you notice,
Warrior/crusader/brawler and paladin/shadow knight/ranger all sound
like that first fighter base class. That leaves Mage, theif, priest
and tradesmen WITHOUT examples of the next steps. I'm guessing bard =
thief path.
