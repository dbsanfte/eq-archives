Personally speaking, I chose a druid for the *option* of soloing, for
when I didn't have long to play or just plain wasn't in the mood to
group.

ALL my best experiences in EQ have been in groups. In fact, I've been
fighting in Paw the last couple of nights with some really good people
(and jeez.... you NEED them to be good in Paw!). Considering dungeons
aren't the most druid-friendly environment, it's been some of the best
damn fun I've had in the game. Why? A good group. People knowing their
roles. No muppet thinking a mezzed mob is one that won't hit back
(*sigh*). A cleric that doesn't think he's a tank. A tank that knows
how to taunt. A puller that understands low mana = death. A chanter
that can mez perfectly in tight environments. And finally of course, a
druid that likes to solo sometimes, but understands group dynamics,
and how to work in a team, and doesn't sulk coz he can't be a wolf in
dungeons ;-)
