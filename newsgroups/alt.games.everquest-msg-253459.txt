If your warrior got and held agro over a GoD geared paladin with just
'incite'... the paladin wasn't even bothering to try to agro off you.
It has a 30 second reuse and at best you're looking at the same set
amount of agro as say.. a Taunting Blow proc.

Of course.. this does assume you are only using incite to agro which
is what you stated. The nice part is you can use a successful taunt +
incite to get over top anyone most of the time.

As per GoD AA.. I'd say its worth the cost for Weapon Affinity alone.
But you also have Sturdiness which is 5 ranks of 100hp each. Buy the
first two levels cheap(12AA total for 200HP) and ditch the other 3
until later. You also have the Tribute System which should add another
150hp, 50AC, and Veng X. The leadership abilities are also quite
nice... I recently added HoTT(Health of Target's Target), which is an
excellent way to show who has agro on a mob and their health at any
point in time, you can also get 100HP more off of leadership.

As per tanking in GoD... if you think keeping agro is the only thing
that matters... you should give the instanced zones a go.

Step out of the minors and come to GoD... then talk about the dumbing
down of the game. At the same time if you get along well, the lower
zones have some upgrades for your character that are pretty darned
nice.

Give GoD a try :>.

/shrug. I like it.
