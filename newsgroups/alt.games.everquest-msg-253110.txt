    I never did the newbie quests for a High Elf cleric, but I did for a
dark elf cleric.  And I know that there were some rare drops in there that
made the quest somewhat difficult (by newbie standards) to do.  As long as
you are sure you are killing the right sort of bats in the right area, and
if you are finding giant bat fur I would guess that you are, then I would
bet that you just have to keep at it, and know that this is a feature of
quests in Everquest.  Namely, they tend to be tedious.

   If no one here knows the answer, I would go to Allakazam's and look up
the chatter in the quest section about this.  There is alot of gripping and
useless info, but some real helpful stuff as well.  You can find the link
for it in the link section of the FAQ in my sig.  It's a good sight to
visit is you like doing quests, and for other reasons as well.

     Yep, it can.  But... dye costs about 30 plat to make, more or less. 
Almost all vendors who sell it do so at a profit, reasonably enough.  For
example, I used to sell it for around 40-45 plat each, which was the
standard price on Firiona Vie at the time.  I don't know about other
servers now, of course, but I doubt that you'll find it for very much more
less than that.  It takes 7 dyes to do a whole outfit, helm to feet.
If you have an extra 300-400 plat lying around, then of course use it as
you will.  But I would be willing to bet that in many cases, you could find
better armor in the bazaar than the newbie stuff for the price of the dye
or less.
