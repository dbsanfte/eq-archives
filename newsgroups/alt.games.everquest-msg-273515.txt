This brings up a question I have...my troll shaman, who is apprehensive to 
the red wine guy (DE cleric guildmaster, I believe he is? Don't remember 
now, I haven't tried it since last week and have done lots more since then), 
can't turn in the red wine. When I give it to him, he hands it back saying 
he doesn't need it. However, my dark elf necro, who is standing with him 
(and was grouped because I mistakenly thought the troll would get faction 
from the dark elf doing the turn in lol...ok, I'm dumb, I should have known 
that wouldn't happen from the times with higher level characters in the 
Warrens trying to get faction...), is able to hand in the wine with no 
problem. Now, apprehensive is higher than dubious, right? I even tried this 
invis, and it didn't change how he regarded my troll, which I thought was 
rather odd. Any suggestions/ideas?
