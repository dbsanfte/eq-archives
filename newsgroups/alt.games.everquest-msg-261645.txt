I think I would have to disagree.   You can't count the fine steel, as those
were never really meant to be drops.   They were just there for a little
vendor trash, and so that mobs would wield weapons as well instead of all
looking the same.  OoW has the same kind of drops, only now they're even
more obvious about it, listing Available classes "None."

As for the named drops... yes, you can most definitely fight in Karnors
Castle when the Jarsath armor that drops there is *really* an upgrade.  And
the Kunark class armor... "Wow, look at all that armor class.  And clicky
effects!"    We know that this is possible because its *exactly* what we
did, back when Kunark was new.   And even when Velious was new.

The difference is, at that time KC was considered a 50 - 55 zone (I remember
level 44's trying to get groups there being laughed out of the zone.)
Whereas today, with the bazaar gear commonly and cheaply available, KC is
done by level 40 to an absolute max of 50.   Often with just a partial
group.   But if you have the kind of gear that lets you do KC 10 levels
earlier without even a full group... yeah, all the drops there are going to
look like crap.   It's just a function of the massive mudflation that comes
with each expansion.
