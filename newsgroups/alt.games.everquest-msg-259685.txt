It beats the sell back prior to them adding that, your only option was to 
destroy it.  Actually, for augments, you had the option of turning them in 
for full points for a while, but for armor, you had zero options once it 
was obsolete.  Fortunately, I hung on to my one obsolete piece of armor, 
and got lucky, as they added the sellback in.
