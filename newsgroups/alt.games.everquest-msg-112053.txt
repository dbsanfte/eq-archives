Camping, is the act of waiting for a particular mob to spawn so that you may
kill it.

The mobs that drop rare loot, quest items, etc, usually spawn at certain
intervals, and do not drop the desired item all the time.  When you are
waiting at it's spawn point and killing it until you get the desired loot,
you are camping it.  IE: Camping the Ancient Crocodile in Guk for Gatorscale
Leggings.

People also camp certain spots that are known for their rapid spawns and
amount of mobs.  IE: Sarnak fortress and Goblin caves in LOIO.  Throne room
and Trainer in CB, etc...

Hope that helps...
