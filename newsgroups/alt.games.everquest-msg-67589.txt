I also have a Geforce2 Xtasy card and I have what I think is the same problem
you describe.  It is only noticeable some of the time.  I assumed it was due to
the way the new engine draws stuff, but it may be the way the new card
displays.

I went from Voodoo3 to Geforce2 and things speeded up, then I upgraded to
directx 8.1 and things slowed down.  A lot.  Then I updated my video driver to
the one suggested on Verant's web site and things got faster.  It's still more
choppy than before Luclin's release, but new drivers did help.  Run Dxdiag and
see if it sees your driver correctly.
