I'm closing in on 47 warrior, and while I've had a great time in the
City of Mist for the last few levels, I'm feeling the itch to move on to
richer (or at least different) hunting grounds.  Yes, I know that I
could hunt the same spot for a few more, or just move further into the
zone, but I like seeing new places.
  So, given our normal travelling group, soon to be 47 Warrior, 45
Cleric, 45/46 Rogue, and the occasional addition of one or more of
following: shaman, ranger, paladin, or necro......
  What are some good spots? I was thinking of testing the waters of
Velk's lab near the zone line, but that may still be well over our
heads, and if not we certainly couldn't go in far from what I've heard.
Other suggestions sought.
  Normal motives as with anyone else: a zone where we can learn some
good tactics to pull without too many deaths once we get the hang of it,
reasonable xp generation rate, and maybe the chance at some nice drops
we can either use/sell/give to guildie and newbies/etc.
  Dungeons preferred for xp bonus and better loot, but any ideas
welcome.
TIA
