location is "c:\\program files\\everquest"), and delete the files for
the zone that you were last in, or zoning into (the file names will
start with the zone name). While in the EverQuest directory you will
want to also delete all files ending in the ".opt" extension along
with the zone files.

EverQuest. In order to do this, log into EverQuest and click Options
on the first menu. On the last page of the options you will see Sound.
All you need to do is uncheck this and it will then be disabled until
you recheck it.

character out of the zone it is stuck in.

Sorry about the bad line wrapping. Side-effect of copy-pasting from a
