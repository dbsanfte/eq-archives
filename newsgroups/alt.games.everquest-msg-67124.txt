Find a box whose reposition handle *is* onscreen. Lets say its the 
inventory box for sake of argument. Open up eqclient.ini in a text editor 
and look for the section marked [Windows800], then find the lines:

InventoryWinY=20
InventoryWinX=150

Note the number for x and y, then set all the problem windows to these 
values too.

So in this example, you'd set:

SpellsWinY=20
SpellsWinX=150
HotButtonWinY=20
HotButtonWinX=150

When you restart the game, all the windows you moved will be stacked on top 
of each other, from where you can drag them to wherever you like.
