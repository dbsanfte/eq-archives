Now THATS not a fair assumption either DT. I will grant you that the Zek
servers may indeed attract a higher number of, shall we say, less socially
inclined, peolpe than do a normal ruleset-server. However thats not to say
that were ALL jerks. Some of the niceset people Ive met have been on Vallon
Zek. As a rule Id be willing to wager that people on a Zek server are more
polite than they would normally be, just because there CAN be consequences
to thier words/actions. Thats NOT to imply though that the people that play
on a red server are any better, or worse than players on any other server.

Besides, theres somthing VERY gratifying about being able to actually DO
somthing about it when you do encounter one of those social cripples that
you speak of ;)
