Beautiful! Thanks!

One more question, if I may. (I just started a bard, so I've got a million 
of 'em! lol) If I hit the macro button again, will it toggle the songs off?

I ask because someone told me to use /melody 1 to turn off attack songs 
after I got killed by a guard that I inadvertently attacked. I didn't know 
that it would start songs too

TIA,.
