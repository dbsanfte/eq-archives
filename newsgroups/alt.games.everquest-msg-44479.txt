Those are for the Ice Comet quest - funny you should mention it.  I ran the
quest last month just for the mid-way reward:   "Star of Eyes."  (effect:
Identify, unlimited)

I was going to recommend the original fellow get Identify cast on it.

As for nodrop ground spawn, skinning stones in EW are nodrop and are part of
the Direwolf Cloak quest (AC 7, 5 Str).  There are other similar quests -
mask and boots, some of which also require more nodrop ground spawn items.
