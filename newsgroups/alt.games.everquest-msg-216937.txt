And I'll likewise respond in all caps.

HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY CLAIM THAT WE WILL PULL AT EXACTLY THE SAME RATE?

If my group dips to 20 mana, I'll pull.  Your group dipped to 70% on that
pull, you wait.  I'm ahead.  Things then go smooth for a while.  My group
gets to 40 mana, 50 mana...  yours gets to 100 mana at least once in there,
and probably more than once.  Wasted resources.  Of course at this point
we're both pulling at the absolute fastest rate possible, there I'll agree
with you.  But then I pull the room of 5 and it takes a big chunk of mana. 
Cleric drops back to 20%.  Your cleric drops to 70.  I pull, you wait.  I'm
farther ahead.

If you're not waiting to pull, why do you bother to argue when you're
agreeing with me?  (See, I can do that too  :P)

Did I mention needing to take a med break?  No?  Didn't think so. 
Collection missions are tough on time, I'd love to hear your record of
completing them after listening to you stump on about ultra-conservative
play.

> even if its only "pull faster, times running out"

I can't pull faster.  That whiny cleric is bitching about being below 80
mana.

Oh, and a flash for those not paying attention.  Time is *always* running
out.  :P

Well duh, of course he wasn't pulling at my normal pace.  He was pulling as
if he'd read this thread and wanted so badly to prove you were right.  Of
course, that didn't exactly pan out...  but hey, we never had any fear of
dying!
