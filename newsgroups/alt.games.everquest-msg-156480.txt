Here's an idea (suggested by something along these lines on
EQcleric forum...) for a cleric ability that might be
interesting:

Fasting.  If you have no food and no water, you lose natural HP
regen, lose stamina... but gain a boosted mana regen.  Force
Feeding doesn't help here, by the way, you need to be at the
point where you are actually dropping stamina.  When your stamina
bar drops down to zero, you lose the mana regen...starving
yourself is a relatively short term plan.

Summon food, force feed it, and start again.

The real cost would be in HP regen, but to a cleric, thats not
the most terrible thing to lose by any means.

Not sure this is balanced, not sure its really needed, not sure
it would really help... but just a thought that occurred to me
when I read someone else's "fasting" suggestion.
