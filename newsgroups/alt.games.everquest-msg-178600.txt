We don't fear kite.. I think it would be slower.

We use DS and I think it still does 50% of the damage.. especially because I
pull anything from 2 to 10 mobs at once, all unslowed, all unmezzed, and let
them just whack themselves to death while we kill 1 at a time

Most amusing was pulling the ENTIRE rockhopper cave at level 35ish, in DSP.

Gotta love wrong turns and over pulls (it was all VERy red con).. ae mez and
slow are limited (4-5 targets) my mage pet got smacked down (55 mage, hes
the DS source), he managed to gate out (premature, but I thought a wipe was
imminent).

Cleric was under a bub hp(ranger bot), I was trying to keep them under
control on the chanter, keep the cleric alive w/my shaman, keep my shaman
alive...)  a mix of kiting, chanter charming and shaman tanking..   the kind
of thing that made me ROFL IRL, to see them running around, and somebody
running in circles for their life, with maybe 200hp left..  god knows how,
but we killed them all and survived a TPW.

Damn did it get close tho
