Text muds have never made the huge profits or drew in the huge numbers
like EQ. The number of people playing online text muds is
insignificant compared to the rapidly growing MMRPG communites
currently on the Internet. 

Airwarrior was replaced by AW2 (which is similar to the proposed
evolution of EQ). Players of the original AW had to choose between the
two, and the community had to deal with the split. AW2 recently died
due to lack of revenue (low player numbers), which is a perfect
example of what will happen to EQ1 some day in the future. In case the
point has escaped you, you have just defeated your own arguments with
the example you provided.

Airwarrior does not use a "character" model (it is a dogfight-frag
arena model similar to quake). The ultra-niche text mud market is an
example of characters lasting 2-3 years or more, but is not a large
enough community to serve as a valid example. Many D&D players have
paper characters over 20 years old by now, but that doesn't validate
your argument that Verant is wrong for producing EQ sequels that
"might" force players to start over every couple of years.

The mechanics of EQ play the same at level 6, as they do at level 60.
(kill-mobs, loot mobs, sell/use items, rinse and repeat) The only
difference is scale (players get more powerful, mobs get more
powerful). You could argue that at higher levels raid tactics (eq
CHeal chains) change the way the game plays for certain encounters,
but most people do not spend all of thier time raiding. 

The high-end game in EQ is more about spending huge amounts of time to
get "phat lewtz", than role-playing or character building. A player
that spends his time with friends, tradeskills, roleplaying, etc, etc
and never hits level 60, is not missing out on much at all.

You still have not provided any examples or evidence. Let's see an
example from you where Verant was not "customer friendly" in the past.

Support your argument that Verant doesn't care about the
players/community, or admit that you cannot.

>awwww... maybe I should give english lessons like you mr. intelligent.

You are more suited to giving "engrish" lessons, but keep trying.
