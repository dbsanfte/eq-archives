> Ooh! Stormhammer without a GM on, and all that extra money you're paying
too

No worries there my friend, the *round the clock* GM *service* is no more. I
petitioned at 2 am, though there was no GM on. Go up at 6am this morning,
petitioned again, got a tell from the GM at about 11:30 - Not much in the
way of *support* for the cash we pay, is it? LOL ..

Anyway, you were right, the GM wasn't able to help me at all. I accepted
that, but I wasn't too pleased when the GM *told* me what had happened,
because it simply was totally different - GM told me my second body had
poofed, when in actual fact it was rezzed.

Your guild friend was right to be a bit shy, isn't it amazing the way people
bind themselves, with no thought whatsoever of entering a 'death loop' ..

Safe hunting to you ..

Stevie.
