I guess it comes down to what you expect from a game (entertainment) and 
what you expect from reality. In reality, I have to do a host of 
unentertaining things (go to the bathroom, vacuum my aparment, change an 
occasional flat tire, work at my job, etc) in order to "proceed." A 
game, even a highly realistic game, abstracts a lot of this kind of 
stuff, sometimes eliminating it entirely in the process. But we can 
imagine it's all still there on some level.

I play games for fun. I like that realistic games mimic the *appearance* 
of reality while simplifying the *function* of reality. Without this 
simplification, it ceases to be entertainment and becomes just another 
aspect of reality.

Imagine having a menial job, and then coming home from work to do your 
job all over again, but this time you call it a "reality game." Would 
you continue to play such a game? I wouldn't.
