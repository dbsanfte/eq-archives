First of all, this is not my first post on the usenet.

I was called a troll b/c my name was not familiar.  That is not the
definition of a troll.  It is just a response from a person that cannot
handle the truths of my post.

Second of all, I think you are one disgusting person who plays EQ.

I said:  Annie's view points are biased.  She is looking at the situation
from a woman's perspective.

Then you respond with references to the male and female genitalias.

(Annie:  So everyone who has a vagina is biased?  Thanks for clueing me in.
Please
tell me, are people who have penises instead of vaginas unbiased?)

It seems to me that you don't understand what I said.  Let me rephrase my
previous statement.

Annie's view points are biased because she is looking at the situation from
a woman's perspective.

I am saying that your post is biased b/c you are looking at the situation
from a woman's perspective.  It is about perspective and not about
genitalia.  A man could show the same bias as yours if he looks at the
situation from a woman's perspective.

What kind of problem are you talking about?  I believe you missed my message
again.  I am talking about the problem of losing one's real life to EQ.
