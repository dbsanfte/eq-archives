You're gonna get best value shopping the bazaar on your server, which
makes it hard to recommend specific items.  That said, ac/hp will be
your friend, both while working to skill-up Defense and afterwards
when you learn first hand about heal agro.  Don't bother with 2hb,
you want a wis/mana item or a shield in that off hand (and some shields
give wis and/or mana along with ac/hp/resists... shop for value!).
On my server Donal's Vambraces (kunark cleric arms) are extremely cheap
(300pp or less), which would be an easy way to get a nice ac boost from
a single slot.  The Cleric class Temple of Ro Bracers (Bracers of the
Reverent, iirc) are ac9 and 5wis, really the only decent piece in that
whole set.  A large mana pool is handy when you're being overwhelmed by
a train, meaningless otherwise, so how much +wis and +mana you want
depends on where you're fighting and how realistic your puller is
(i.e. random grouping in popular zones = you want lotsa +wis/+mana).
The most useful focus items for you would be Mana Preservation (BA
Medallion or Fine Antique Ring both give MP 2), Extended Enhancement
(Drakescale Belt gives EE 2), the ever-popular Improved Healing
(I have yet to see or hear of a "reasonably priced" IH 2 item, or a
quest for one that wasn't a "gawdawful evil f***ing mindless timesink
I'll do without the stupid POS"), and Spell Haste (if you're planning
to live your life as a KEI-head, Spell Haste becomes by far the most
useful of these four).

Good luck,
Kaev
