To be honest, similar things have happened to me. Not rez's or anything,
but folks with questionable names have been helpful.

I would never ask Macanus for assistance.  However, if I am thinking
about petitioning his name, and the fates step in and have him help
me for some reason. I will repay the kindness my not reporting the name.
This time.

Anyway, I probably wouldn't even notice Macanus.  It just doesn't
stand out to me.  I usually get the "Bigbaddude"s or the
"Yourwors" (necro, you just KNOW he'll pick nitemare at 20) type
names.  I usually let character names go unless severely over done.
I've let my share of Kithkanen's, Gimli's, and Fizban's go.
However, if I see just one more variant of Raistlin go by, I'm gonna
kill something.
