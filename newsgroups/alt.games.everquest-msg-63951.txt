I don't know how to break this to you, but 256MB of DDRAM is not the equal
of 512MB of SDRAM.  You can still only have a total of 256MB of data in your
ram, yes, it will read and write about twice as fast as SDRAM, but it is
still only 256MB.  If the software has to go to disk to get data into/out of
ram, then the speed of the ram is not very meaningful, the speed of the disk
access, and subsequent transfer of data from/to the disk is what will be the
issue.  Basically, you will have a marginal increase in speed over someone
with the same amount of SDRAM, because most of the time is being spent
dealing with the disk drive, not the ram.
