I don't know of a list anywhere...usually by the time you can hunt in the
dungeon you'll know before you get there if it's one-way.

The Plane of Air/Sky is the only zone of which I am aware that you cannot
gate/port out of.  You simply jump off any of the islands in the sky and
you'll end up somewhere below (well, EFP in the water for sure...don't know
if different islands will drop you off in different zones...I've only been
there once).  Howling Stones/Charssis I THINK is gate-out-only, as is the
Plane of Growth.

Eh, I could be wrong about those two...Only been to HS once, and PoG a
couple times, but with my perfectly safe druid (ugly zone, btw) the first
week Velious was up (thank god I didn't know about Wuoshi or I STILL
wouldn't be there).
