first of all   thats the first time in two tyears of playing that i
"whined" even though ive had to upgrade and reupgrade again.  I am
regularly exposed to whiners and bitchers in the ng and never once
complained. PARDON ME for blowing off some steam for a change. It seems
to me that there are others who regularly flame and whine that could
better use your negative scrutiny.  thank you
