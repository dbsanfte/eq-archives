Hi,

I have been trying to find a price for this ring for a few days now,
playing on luclin but no one seems to know, the stats ar INT +3 and
MANA +10

Also if anyone knows the price on spear of winter

Spear of winter
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM

Slot: PRIMARY
Charges: 1 (it is a proc effect so this number is wrong)
Skill: Piercing  Atk Delay: 27
DMG: 8
Effect: Spirit Strike
WT: 4.0
Class: WAR ROG SHM
Race: ALL

The spear would be nice for my rogue or shaman i think,
both the ring and spear drops in iceclad, but the ring also
in Kael drakkel, and eastern wastes

/Regards Berth
