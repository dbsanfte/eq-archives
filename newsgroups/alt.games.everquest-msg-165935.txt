I was reading http://www.teamxspeed.com/wtf/ and it got me nostalgic about
crushbone.

I was playing a necro before the bazaar opened and couldn't sell the
multitudes of stacks of bone chips, so i figured i'd give them to a dwarven
cleric, but noone wanted them, so i made one, gave chips, ding ding ding and
then i realised i had no defensive skills, so i'm now working on them, and
they are coming along nicely.

My dwarven cleric (lv 12 woohoo!) didn't have great faction except thru
handing in hooooge quantities of bone chips. Orcs raise a lot of nice
factions (I like faction, particularly if it's a) easy b) relevant from a RP
perpective) so i wandered over there with my 30 druid as a safety net, and
actually found it impossible to find anything that wasn't taken! Amazing.

I recall my iksar monk working his way to ally with the dwarves and wood
elves (this was nerfed to kindly, alas) running around by himself there,
with occasionally someone wandering in to get keys for the slaves or kill
dvinn for his dagger (which was twink gear, back in the dawn of time).

The place was wall to wall with people powerlevelling and unwilling to
group... kind of like paladuial caverns come to think of it, except it was
even more pathetic because faction is the one thing in eq that can be shared
without being lessened; up to the limit of players that a mobs hate list
holds i presume? 20? 10?

Anyway, i'm still camped there but i'm playing with moving on, or playing
when the americans are asleep, whichever comes first. Does anyone know
anywhere else a cleric could play like that which has "good" faction, but no
animals, as they then end up wrecking my druid's factions? West commons
would be ideal if the bears would just calm down a bit, as the orcs there
are rarely camped now except by some uber farming belts.

Just on the topic of faction, i wish the barbarians faction improved if you
killed some of the low level mobs near halas, it seems silly that the other
old world cities work that way... my iksar monk just wants to be loved, what
can I say?

p.s. the mp3 player is fantastic, and it's sad about mobhunter, and I'm
really hanging out for the next installment of WTF comics.
