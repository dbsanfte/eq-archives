I understand very well, thank you.   Although I did exadurate some.   There
are under 55 mobs in PoP that drop parchments as well, just rarer, while I
limited it to 55 plus.

Price of a windblade.  20k in the bazaar pre droprate nerf.   40k after.

Price of a PoP spell in the bazaar (yes, they are all droppable once the
turn in has been done), 20 k.

If you don't like the parchment system, buy your upgrades the same way I
would have to buy mine. (If I could, almost all of my upgrades are no-drop)
Pissing and moaning that you need rare drops from *any PoP mob* is not going
to win you sympathy from me.   At least you get upgrades from anything.   I
get none unless I take down raid level targets.

You're the one bitching that the system is not fair.   I just told you what
the fair system really would be.
