C'mon Dennis - your smarter than than, you know that's not the reason. How
come it's common knowledge outside the US that the power fuck ups were
caused by the policy of energy producers selling power to brokers and
brokers selling the power to the utility companies at "ass over the barrell
and cheese grater inserted" prices during peak demand?

Overseas it is seen as a case example of what happens when people let their
politicians blindly sell them out to their corporate cronies in the name of
"globalisation".
