Test it, and you'll see that whatever the reason, it works as
I describe.  You don't have to actually step off the boat to
go from "Indifferent" to an "actual" /con with a mob on the
dock.  Simply moving from one spot on the boat to another will
drop the "Indifferent" con.

Furthermore, if you've been running around on the boat and
then stop motionless a few seconds before the boat slides up
to the dock, you'll also fail to con "Indifferent" because
you haven't been motionless long enough to "blink out".

"Silly graphics bug" or not, you are "indifferent" to the NPCs on
the dock if you are "invisible" to the other folks on the boat,
and you are not "indifferent" to the NPCs on the dock if you
are not "invisible" to the other folks on the boat.

It's probably not intentional, but that's the way it works.

A dramatic result of this was the time that I was on the boat
with a bunch of fellow newbies (at the time) as it slid up
to the Sister's dock.  Someone yelled, "Corrupted Cyclops
at dock!", and sure enough the Corrupted then proceeded to
rapidly slay everyone on the boat who had moved recently.
I hadn't, I was sitting still meditating, and I was left
untouched.  My friend was below-decks with me, and she
was killed because she had been meandering around looking
at the "bar" -- her corpse ended up nicely laying across
the bar itself, looking like she had passed out drunk.  :-)

The GM's had a busy day that day, recovering corpses from
the boat.  And note that none of these folks had stepped
OFF the boat, they were all waiting around for the boat
to resume its voyage to Butcherblock.  But they had all
moved on deck to get a look at Sister's Island, and/or
watch out for the Corrupted -- big mistake.
