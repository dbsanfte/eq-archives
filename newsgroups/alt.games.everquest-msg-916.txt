i was in a group last night in ill omen and this is what happened:

my group was the following levels

shammy 23
paladine 25
warrior 20
rogue 24
cleric 22
mage 24

the cleric was leaving and so i as the group leader shouted that we were
looking for a cleric...and suprisingly one responds instantly "hi im ltg
where are you guys?"

i tell him and then tell group and they say cool what level?

so i ask him and he says 29 and i was like ok hold on

my group freaks out b/c we have the pali who is lvl 20 and claim he wont get
any exp

now i was told that the 5 level limit was only for newbies and that after
lvl 20 it is roughly as long as the person is w/in 3/4 of the highest level
they will get exp

does anyone know what the rules are on this?

i know that i have received good experience w/ a rogue at 22 and a shaman at
30 and monk at 28 w/ no problems but is there less exp given or more or what
and how are the percentages distributed?

i know w/ the new patch the highest level char will get more but what are
the %s?

Thanks
Rogue 25 Terris Thule
