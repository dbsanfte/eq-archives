I tried to put in a new video card, and it hammered my system, so I
reformated me HDD, and put old video card back in. Ever since then when I
try to play EQ I get bad lag in some places. Especialy when I open my spell
book.. When I try to turn pages its slow in responding. It also happens a
lot worse in Velious, in BB / GF I don't really lag at all. I tried 3-4
video drivers, and none worked, all my other games work fine.. ( well
rainbow 6 graphics are a little distored sometimes, but its playable) but
what really bothers me is playin' EQ. I can be running from a  MOB and next
thing you know I just about stop moving. I get like 2-6 FSP. in about a
minute or two, I am compleatly back to normal speed. Its also very bad in
Thurgian when I am inside and look tword the bridge I almost stop. I used to
have all my graphics turned up to full, now I got 3d skys, off, and
particals from high to med, and 640X480 res. and I still lag bad. I checked
with ISP my line seems clean, and I get 1200+ Kbps download... Anyone else
have any thing like this problem ?

I mostly play EQ on a PIII 533, 265M, on a voodoo4 4500 3dfx card. I never
had trouble with EQ before even on Full acceleration..
