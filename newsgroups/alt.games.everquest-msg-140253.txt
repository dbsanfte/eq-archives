There's huge debates about this in Tolkien geekdom. The problem is
that, if Orcs were bred from corrupted Elves (or Men, in some of
Tolkien's drafts), because Melkor could not create anything, then do
they have an elven soul? Are they irredemably evil? Do their spirits
go to Valinor after death?

Here's a summary, from rec.arts.books.tolkien

Whoops, that's my geekery out of the bag then!
