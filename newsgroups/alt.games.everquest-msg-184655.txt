Now wait a minute here DT he didnt say anything outa line, theres been
a shit load of problems since bandwidth in EQ became a punch list item
for SoE. The worst bugs we've seen since SoL have occured since BW

caused by these BW reduction measures is a pretty good guess, dont see
you offering any alternatives. You owe the guy a retraction.
