Just to amplify, since were I a newbie reading this, I'd be scratching my 
head and shooting straight for FV...

Firiona Vie was created as an experiment in role-playing.  It has a 
slightly different ruleset than the normal servers.  The big advantage 
(aside from that it's RP, if that's what you want) is that everything is 
sellable.  On regular servers, many items (mostly things received from 
quests) can't be given away or sold--they have to be gotten directly from 
the monster's corpse, as it were.  The big disadvantages, particularly for 
a new player, are that there are quite a few less players on FV than on the 
regular servers and that there are language restrictions.  Without a 
certain amount of work, wood elfs can only speak to wood elfs, trolls only 
to trolls, etc.  The net result is that it's a bit of a pain to group up 
once you're anywhere away from your hometown until you've taken "language 
lessons".  Oh, and frankly, I didn't even find FV to be all -that- 
roleplayish.  It's more so than the regular servers, but Neverwinter Nights 
has nothing to worry about on that front.

It really is probably best to start on a regular server.  You'll learn the 
rules, conventions, and strategies of the underlying game much more 
quickly.  Once you have some grasp on those, go dip a toe in FV and see if 
it's for you.
