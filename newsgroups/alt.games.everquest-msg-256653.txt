Now thats not fair, there's a distinct difference between a character 
and a class.  He could easily be playing something along the lines of an 
unkempt druid, for example.

My cleric wanted to be a paladin and thought of himself as a coldain, 
not one of those fussy Kaladim dwarves, although he never ended up 
hunting Dwarves (because they never seemed particularly evil) he 
wouldn't have thought much more about it than do the many Dwarves who 
end up hunting Coldain to get Kael faction.

What target is there which a druid of some sort couldn't reasonably 
kill?  I mean, a Tunare druid might balk at killing Tunare or even her 
minions, but a Karanas druid might well not have any trouble with that 
idea...
