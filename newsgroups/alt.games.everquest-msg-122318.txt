Thats the point. Fuck is offensive because thats what its there for.
It is a harder, stronger word for copulate, make love, screw,
whatever, all of which have varying connotations and positions along
the scale. Nobody is saying "find a synonym for fuck thats not offensive"
as that would be impossible; part of Fucks strength IS its gritty
reference to an act of sex while making no reference to tenderness,
love, sharing , etc - and this connotation is what , I suspect,
many people find offensive.

They're not wrong to do so; I dont, particularly, but then I dont
suggest everybody should submit to my cultural values, especially
not in a forum I'd like as many as possible to participate in - if its
germane to the discussion (as it is now, for example), I'm more tha
happy to say fuck as much as required; I do not believe 'children
might be watching so adults must behave as children' is a valid
argument.

That said, I also believe if its not germane or useful and somebody
has politely said can you tone it down a little, its to the benefit
of us all to do so. It costs us nothing and gains another voice for
a community that exists solely on the strength of diversity of its 
knowledge and participants. In my opinion "it doesnt offend me,
Im ok jack, so fuck you too" is a pretty selfish position.

Of course, this being usenet, my opinion counts for precisely
this much ;) Still, it'd be a shame to see folks turn away for
reason other than an obsession with either doing as one wants and
not modifying your behaviour for anyone no matter how
inconsequential, or , more bizzarely, to prove a belief that all
words that refer to a particular thing have the same power and
connotations and anyone who believes otherwise should just read
them again and again until they agree.

Sui, Damn I'm preachy today. Shoulda been a cleric.
