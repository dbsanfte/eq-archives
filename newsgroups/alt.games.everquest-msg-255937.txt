If normal charm pet does ALL damage you get a tiny fraction of xp, a mob
that would give a soloer 5-6% would give you 1% or less.

If you do 1 point of damage (blue ceramic band with its 5 point dot is
popular) to a 20k hp mob, you get roughly 2/3 of xp, or ~4% on the above
mob.
Theres a sliding scale here, where if the pet barely touches the mob you get
99% of the xp, but I dont know the numbers offhand. The important thing is
pet can do 99.999% of damage & you still get the majority of the xp, as long
as you tap the mob for 1 point. Watch for full resists tho, they dont count.

DC pets take 50% of the xp for the damage they do to the mob, they do 10% of
the damage they take 5% of the xp. Not sure if you still have to do 1 point
to get the gravy xp, as I find it damn hard to wait for even a hasted mage
gear dual wield DC pet to kill something solo (that I would xp on).

Basically, if you can clear your camp without pets you should, if you have
limitless mobs you should only give up the pet if the charmer needs too much
help to control it. If its inbetween, measure your xp gain both with &
without a pet for an hour or so.
DC pets are just an upgrade to animation dps and chanter slum soloing/duoing
ability.

You can probably find exact #'s at www.therunes.net.
