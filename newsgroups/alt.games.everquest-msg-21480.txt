Hadn't really thought about the mez situation... I do notice when people
ask me into a dungeon anymore my first question is "do you have a
chanter?" and it's not the clarity I'm thinking about.  No chanter, no
cleric, that's my new motto.  Still, been in plenty of situations where
you are under multiple adds all at once, and root till chanter gets around
to mezing has sure been of use.  I'll likely switch to immobilize for this,
purely for the "faster" component.

Mana-wise I'm rarely the weakest link... thats the paladins.  Nowdays, Paladins
who know what they are doing can -chew- down the mana!  Lol, I remember
at least one group where we were crying out for Clarity for the paladin and
Celerity for the cleric... he didn't need the haste and I didn't need the mana.
That was before I hit 44, though, and was forced to give up on Melee.

Atone works much better than mem blur, and used on mobs that haven't
been hit its quite effective.  Best when the mobs aren't KOS to you, and
pretty useless if someone is DOTing.  You hit the nail on the head about
the long refill, though, since at our levels it often takes two casts to
get full effect, you can't rely on it working before whatever is holding the
mob down wears off.  I like it when in a fight where I don't want the
faction hits, though, more often than not I can erase the effects of healing
the tanks and make nice.  I've also used it in a raid to control exp, by
atoning when the mob is near death and having a nuker drop a large
bomb, we KS the rest of the groups.  For 50 mana every second
or third or fourth mob, (I only want our fair share) this isn't an expensive
way to turn helping out a guildmate get an epic piece into an exp raid.

Flash should give you far less heebie jeebies than Fear... mobs run around
purposelessly, instead of off as though they have a plan, and they don't run
very far before it wears off.  Still woulnd't use it to park indoors, what
it can do for you there is aggro control.  Once they engage a tank, if
you keep em blind they -stay- on the tank, never turn around to jump
a caster.  Better than root, because when they get hurt enough to run
they do so... and its faster and cheaper than -anything- you'll ever
cast.  10 mana.  10.  No matter how OOM I"ve ever gotten, I've been
able to get flash off.  Unlike DA, it refreshes quickly, flash and back
up and you are -out- from under, and even indoors odds aren't all that
good that the mob will stumble across help that wasn't already involved.
Also a quick way to save casters lives, tanks lives, anyone that is close
to death and can't shake aggro... I think for the first 39 levels I -always- had

flash memmed.

I"m likely not in three stun mode?  Depends on the dungeon, but I can't tell
you how often I am in that mode.  Retribution is in there if I'm in Nuke
mode (and I should have put the undead nuke there as well, which makes
it far more likely I'm in Nuke) and Strike if I'm pulling... which as you note
isn't likely indoors.  Nice thing about that slot is I can hot swap in
situationals,
too... but I won't be able to do that if I have a second Divine up, as that
permanently dedicates the slot.

Drop celestial healing?  (shudders) There is one time when that spell isn't
memmed, and I'll give you a hint, the words LOAD PLEASE WAIT
precede those times.  Your reasoning would be sound if you only
occaisionally chain stun, and always hot swap in the third stun on
the fly to do so... which would mean you have advance knowledge
that you are going to be doing so.  I"m thinking in terms of Karnors
Castle, say, where who knows when Curate will next pop, or
Sirens Grotto where the Moltors are pretty random... or CS where the
Drakes are targets of opportunity we grab on sight (admittedly in the
latter case I do have adequate warning to swap in a stun, especially
since its probably me pulling em)

I don't not do it, I don't feel -that- guilty about doing so... but waste a
second slot on an even less likely to be used self only spell?  One that
doesn't work as well as DA, either?  (longer cast means more chance
for interrupt, higher cost means more chance I'm too OOM to do it)

Well yes, of course its for when things are going badly.  When things are
going well, a cleric might as well be what half the people in this newsgroup
will tell you he is... heal and med, with occaisional buffage to break
up the monotony.  Your MePark strikes me as a terrible waste of mana
and clerical attentions - I me park just long enough to get that mob
pulled away from the group so I can root it, then I leave it behind.

I'm not very high on the Heal priority list, either, thats Chanter, Main Tank,
Me, Pets, followed by people who did something wrong and got aggro if I
can afford the time and mana.  I'd be higher on that list, except that
conditions
under which I'm taking damage usually require me to help -handle- the
situations,
and then I'm not taking damage just yet and am more worried about stabilizing
the chanter and main tank, preferably with low aggro celestial.  I imagine some
of that may change again when I get Remedy, so I can -quickly- slap a heal
on myself before getting to the tank.

Try to erase the levels under 44 from your mind, as a horror story someone
once told you about a cleric without celestial healing. Remember waiting to
heal someone till superior would get you your mana's worth, or till some
of the mobs died so they wouldn't all aggro on you?  And Superior at those
levels cost so much more of your relative mana than celestial does now...
getting a better -and- cheaper heal at 44 was -such- a treat.  Heal more
damage for less mana more flexibly and more efficiently and with less aggro...
what was verant thinking?  Clearly not the same thing they were thinking
when they added Turning of the Unnatural, which hurts less over more time with
worse mana efficiency and more aggro than your equivalent anti-undead nukes!

Atone helps with those adds.  "These are not the druids you are looking for"
I don't mind making the casters work a little.  Heck, the tanks whine
about having to follow instead of just slugging it out toe to toe too, at
lower levels.  Frankly, I don't even discuss it with them, for 44 levels
I was contributing just as much melee damage in the kite as they were,
and its simply not that hard to do.  The trick to fear kiting is to find a good
spot to pull to, that -gives- you a good "clean path."  If space is limited,
when fear breaks pull back to the start of the path again before reapplying.
You don't mention the main drawback, which is that moving mobs don't
take as much damage from dots... a pity, but if DOTs are the main
damage production, then you root kite.  And you bring a good book to read.

Aye, I think you are right, it doesn't seem practical, other than as a last
ditch effort to clear out stuff so someone can get an EVAC off.  Would
be an amusing thing to walk into an oasis Derv camp and "break" it for
someone by making em all run off in different directions, lol.

I"ve heard that our low CHA may be responsible for our Fears lasting
longer, too... and I'd love to see some evidence there.  Oh, and someone
said the reason Lull line seems so useless is also my pathetic CHA.  CHA
gear is cheap, I ought to try getting up to 130 or so and testing it out
relative
to my 45 cha baseline.

I"m eager to get that, I remember fondly the days when I could use
Center as a low aggro heal, having a low aggro buff refreshing group heal
would be sweet indeed.

Played around with it some in the grotto last night, and no, it doesn't seem to
break earth pet root all that often. Its fun to run around lining up your shots
so as to put the Enraged Bulthar into the corner pocket.

I'm not worried about the party getting on the runner, but if its not snared
(and ooooh do I hate dealing with mobs that aren't) and relatively light
blue, it will often be able to get quite far even if people are beating it down,

since it started running with a good chunk of HP left over.  Dropping 220
damage plus a much longer stun effect on the target might be nice.  Could
turn a snared but still mobile runner into a permanently stationary target,
too, especially since the tanks have longer to get that HP bar to drop further.
On the other hand, good old ultra cheap stun is =fast= and that counts
for a lot when you are worried about something getting around the corner.
