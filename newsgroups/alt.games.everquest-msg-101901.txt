AFAIK the only way to do this would be to dump your entire "inbox" folder in
your documents and settings folder.  It's buried, and in slightly different
places depending on what OS you are using, but that's the only way I know.
Of course you would want to move any E-mail that is useful before you do
this.  Next time you open your mail program, it should create another inbox
folder.

This is an ultra-paranoid way to do it, and rather unnecessary if you keep a
decent anti-virus and keep it updated, but if you *really* don't want to
click on that message, you could do this.
