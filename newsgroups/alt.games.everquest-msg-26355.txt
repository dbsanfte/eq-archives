Well, with my warrior, if I am running for the zone, I am strafing to outrun
the mobs, this seems to preclude typing anything.  I do try and get a chance
to hit my "train" hotkey, but in the end, if you are sitting at a zone line,
you're in the line of fire.  I never intentionally train anyone, I won't run
for the docks in Oasis for example, but I will run for the zone, if I have a
chance to warn people I do, if not, well, when you sit at the zone line you
take your chances, I know I do.
