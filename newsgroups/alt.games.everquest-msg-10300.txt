You are almost maxxed in 1hs (63 out of 70),  The others need work.  Before
level 18 or so you will want to spend time working on the 2 lower ones.
Generally, my warrior starts a new level using 1hs, switches to 2hs as soon
as dual wield and 1hs max, then to 1hb.  Each takes about 1 yellow bubble to
max.  After that, go for the highest total damage output.  At some point,
get a necro friend and a cleric friend to go with you so you can duel (see I
used both dual and duel in the same message and got it write [damn...]) a
necro pet.  The cleric will keep you both alive.  In a very short time, you
should be able to max a skill (about 2 to 3 hours).
