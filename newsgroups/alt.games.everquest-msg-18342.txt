My idea was an /unmem [slot#]  and a /mem [page#] [spell#] command

that way you could have socials to swap buffs

/book
/pause 5, /unmem 8
/pause 40, /mem 1, 1
/sit off

would unmem the spell in slot 8 and mem the spell from page one
in the upper left corner.

no time savings, but a savings for the wrist.
