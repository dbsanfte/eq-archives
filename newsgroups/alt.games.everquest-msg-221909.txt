Your wrong :p You play a shaman right? At one time they decided that shaman
slows where far more effective than they desired . The easiest way to fix
this was to reduce the effectiveness of all shaman slows by half . It made
sense and all . Enchanters where supposed to be the primary debuffers and
shamans the after market add on debuffer used only in an emergency.

Made sense and all and most agreed it was better that way then to make mobs
hideously fast hitters to make up for the overpowered shaman slow . Most
players wanted it balanced that way. The shamans whined loud and hard that
one of their primary uses was to slow mobs. Why if you took that away they
would become less usefull and be consigned to the dungeon door to sit and
whine piteously for hours for a friendly group to take them. We have mobs
that cannot be handled now WITHOUT slow and that was never in the design.
Shamans made all of us suffer saving their utility.

Where they correct? Would removing an ability that they always had reduce
there use? Would they become less attractive group mates? When you
understand this you will begin to understand the monk nerf effects.

Shamans are within the top 5 classes balance wise , nerfed hard they would
still have some use. I wonder what happen if you take one of the lower 5
balanced classes and nerf them hard? They already suffer before the nerf ,
afterwards it just gets funny unbalanced. This is the situation the monk
finds himself him .

Monks where not particularly desireable BEFORE the nerf. That is one of the
reasons they where seen soloing light blue mobs frequently . Not because
they wanted to solo but because they HAD to . Monks are strictly hand to
hand combat types and that is broken down to just offense and defense, these
where the sole abilities that monks offere to a group , just like their
brother class the warrior. Warriors where designed as 2/3rds defense and a
3rd offense while monks where designed the exact opposite. The nerf
destroyed defense about a 3rd of the monks utility to other players and that
utility was not that high to begin with . The warrior problem is that they
spend 2/3rds of their abilities on defense and cant use it because they cant
assure themselves of being the one hit.
