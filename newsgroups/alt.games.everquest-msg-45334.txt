Not sure if it's worse, but I'm a Mage and I need the cloak from that flying
Horse in South Karana for my Epic. Aside from the fact that you never know
when it's going to spawn, lots of people are killing it on sight because the
cloak is actually usefull for every single character in Norrath (except
maybe Mages who can summon lev-rings  without components, which makes the
cloak even more ridiculous).

I know you guys hate Mages (just look at the mid level quest armor and
things like the mage only
look-a-stick-with-a-reg-shield-as-a-melee-proc-with-no-further-stats-whatsoe
ver-when-every-other-casterclass-gets-a-+10INT-item in KC), but would you
give some of us a brake and make the cloak Mage only... please Verant...

pretty please?


hello?


anyone?


please?
