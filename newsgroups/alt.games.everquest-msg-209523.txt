Well, given that they seem to port in more or less at will to Rathe,
I had always assumed that their homes are well hidden.  Further, note
that only the male HGs are seen, leading to my favorite theory:

The HGs reside in a secret city deep beneath what we know as HG
hill.  There they are ruled by a matriarchy of spellcasters who
keep tight control over the knowledge of magic, in particular
making certain that no males of the species ever acquire magical
powers.  The ruling caste prizes order greatly, and so the more
rambunctious of the males, especially the younger unmarried ones,
have no real outlet for their energy except by taking one-way
portals to the surface.  Because these portals are one way, and
HG Necromancers are unwilling to summon the corpses of these
slackers, the males have learned to head out wearing only their
grubs and carrying nothing beyond chump change and maybe a junk
weapon or two from junior high shop class.  This suits the HG
women just fine, as they wish to prevent the rest of Norrath
learning just how wealthy they are (the city is named El Dorado,
the streets _are_ paved with gold, and they are well aware of the
greed of the "lesser" races).

Hopping a portal out is also a popular way to deal with an unhappy
wife or girlfriend, although this often involves multiple trips to
the surface without a chance to grab some more cash while waiting
for things to cool down.  These hurried "Oh, hi Belle.  Um, ah, er,
gotta run, see you later." hops out thru the nearest portal account
for those occasions that you find an HG with little or no cash in
his pockets.
