Beware; Luclin provides new, more curvacious graphics for all characters,
including half elves. Luclin ALSO changes Velious leather from being perfectly
respectable leg coverings to an even more lingere lacey thong than the nude
graphic.

If you're trying to genuinely stop her getting leered at my recommendation
for a half elf is: Avoid cloth and leather. Go only with a chain or
plate look.

If you're feeling twinky the Brown Chitin Leggings will cover her amply,
look pretty, and have decent stats for a good long while.
