1 cleric per 6 people?  Wow, that sure would be great.

How about 3 clerics for 40 people.. if your lucky 2 of those could even be
bots

Also, as some of our older epic clerics have retired etc, a lot of the newer
recruit clerics were epicless (hardly surprising with that shit-fest known
as rage).. we've gotten a few in recent weeks.  By the sounds of it all your
guild clerics already have sticks - nice.

For the /corpse command.

Moving 40 corpses is one of the least fun things in-game.
