You'll want to save

eqini.ini
eqclient.ini
eqlog.ini (if you have yours set to log so you can run a parser)

and your character optimization files (hotkeys, etc).

These will look something like "aryanna_23.opt".

Just slap 'em back into your spanking new EQ directory after
reinstalling and running the patches. :)
