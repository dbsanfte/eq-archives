I'm going to assume that I'm not the only person who reads this
newsgroup who is having the "can't log on with my main" problem.  Sony
has apparently decided that maybe it isn't all on our end.  They are
asking for some answers to basic questions so that they might fix the
problem.  
   So, go to
http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum3/HTML/045537.html to
add your specs, or if you just want to see what kind of profiles the
victims have.
