An update on my trip:

I left East Freeport and a few minutes later, wound up in 
Butcherblock...on the dock there, I met a nice guy named Nikz that said 
he would lead me to LOIO and would also bind me in Firiona Vie...I 
thought everything was going great, and then we took off on the 
shuttle...little did I know I was about to go thru 2 hours of hell! 

After we zoned to Timorous Deep, our shuttle was lined up next to 2 other 
shuttles, and Nikz was on the far one, so I figured I was supposed to 
follow...as soon as I started to walk toward him, SPLASH, I fell into the 
water! 

After panicking a little bit (alright, a lot), I tried to swim after the 
shuttle, hoping I could get back on...I wasnt unable to catch up, and 
tried to get on another one that I saw, but couldnt climb on it either, 
so I decided to swim back to shore...I THOUGHT i was going in the right 
direction, but about 15 minutes later I noticed that I still hadnt zoned, 
and must be going in the wrong direction. 

Noticing that my yellow stamina bar was very low, I asked Nikz if I would 
drown if it ran out, and was told that I would...I started worrying about 
how I would recover my corpse if I died in the middle of the ocean, but 
luckily it turned out he thought I was underwater and talking about my 
air bar...then I started worrying about whether or not I would be 
attacked while swimming...

A few minutes later, I sent a shout asking for the /loc of the docks 
(stupidly forgetting the dock I was thinking of was in Butcherblock, not 
TD), and started swimming toward the /loc I was given, which turned out 
to be at the far south end of the zone, and I was at the north end... 

I swam for about an hour (not sure exactly how long) and finally made it 
to shore, but then Nikz told me to carefully con the first NPC i see, 
because I might be KoS...luckily I wasnt...I rush up to the dock and the 
Maidens Voyage is there! 

I rush towards it and sadly realized that I had to get on another shuttle 
to get on board, and it left before I could get there...after another 
lengthy wait, I finally got on the Maidens Voyage and after 3 hours of 
hell, made it to Firiona Vie (yey!). 

Ahhhhh what a night! On the bright side, my swimming went from 20 to 
55...
