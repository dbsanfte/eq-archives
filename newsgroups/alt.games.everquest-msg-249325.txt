You obviously have seen John Smedley's letter on the EQ site, the first link
is to a thread from GU Comics but on this page 22, second entry by
Wolfshead, you will read a well written outline of the history, problems and
solutions that CAN happen only if SOE and Smedley will listen.  Also the
second and third link are found within Wolfshead's post.

This link will take you to an article interviewing and explaining history
along with projections of the future of Online gaming.  Very enlightening
considering the Star Wars Galaxies game is pretty much in the trash can IMO.

This link will take you to an interview of old.  Like Wolf said "Obviously
Smedley should have heeded his own advice. Sadly I fear it may be too late."

http://www.gamespot.com/features/btg_y2k/p19_01.html

Everyone has an opinion, an idea and projection of what they would like to
see/do, and what might happen but what the big power house, money hungry
corporation does not get is that we the majority of the player base has sunk
time and their hard earned dollars into a community that we have grown to
love and depend on for what ever reason.

It could be for the love of the game and devotion to our toons, it could be
that this is an outlet from our real lives, it could be that this is the
only form of communication and contact due to illness or extreme shyness.

This is the first format that has broken all barriers of race, religion and
economics of the world since we all have had contact with other players from
different time zones.  We don't know what we do, work or anything, but are
brought together in a world where we assume different roles and can be
anything we wish!

To have this world stripped and catered to the UBER gamers is horrendous and
to have it die do to the deep pockets of a corporation is, I cannot even
find the right words to describe it!

Maybe some of you can find the words.....
