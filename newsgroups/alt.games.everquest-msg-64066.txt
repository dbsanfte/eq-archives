Here's the ones I know about so far, think there are more that we need
(the files that the patcher drops into program files\sony\everquest
after you successfully install and run the patcher)

God, it would be great if someone would be kind enough to post
binaries of the patched files:

globalkem_chr.s3d
snd12.pfs
globalkef_chr.s3d
eqgfx_dx8.dll
global6_chr.s3d
bmpwad6.s3d
lnews.txt
lpatch.exe
bmpwad7.s3d

...just so the patcher wouldn't have to frustrate us any more.

PLEASE NOTE:  DO NOT POST THESE IF YOU DIDN'T RECEIVE THEM FROM THE
PATCHER TODAY --- VERSIONS ALREADY EXIST THAT THE PATCHER IS
***REPLACING***


cheers.
