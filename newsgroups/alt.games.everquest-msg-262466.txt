Nope as long as no one zones in you wont take a loss, if anyone in the group 
zones in before you drop out you will get a loss. You are correct you will 
get a loss even if the group wins and you are cannot get online before the 
30 minute exit time window.

Unfortunately most people believe as you do that this will result in a loss 
and won't join so you can get a mission (not all, but most).
