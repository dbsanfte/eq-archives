> so exp loss per death decreases......amazing

That's as a percentage of level.  As a general rule, higher levels take more
XP than lower levels, so 5.5% of 65 could be a lot more XP than 8% of 62.

However, higher level people tend to fight higher level mobs, giving more XP
per mob, making it so that outside of hell levels (which have been pretty
much eliminated) and anti-hell levels (which 60 seems to be), each level
takes approximately the same number of kills as the previous level, so
percent of a level is often a good way to compare things in terms of time,
which is really what matters to most people.

There are a couple ways the actual XP loss at 62 and 65 could be compared.

(1) ShowEQ.  Sony changed things a long time ago so that the client is only
given percentage updates, making this hard, but when you zone, the client is
given the actual XP value, so people with ShowEQ could still figure out
things...it was just a bit more inconvenient.  I don't know if this is still
the case...it was the last time I checked the ShowEQ forums, to see if the
latest rumor of Sony finally permanently breaking ShowEQ was true (it
wasn't...a few days after that story circulated, the ShowEQ people had
everything working again).  (My theory is that Sony doesn't want to actually
break ShowEQ...just make is annoying enough that casual players won't be
able to use it.  A few well placed ShowEQ users on raids can keep
frustrations down, which probably keeps the need for customer support down).

(2) When for some reason, you have to eat an XP death, count how many mobs
it takes to get the XP back.  Then switch to 100%AA, and kill the same mobs.
See how much AA that gives.  Since AA is the same for all levels, that gives
a comparison of the actual XP.
