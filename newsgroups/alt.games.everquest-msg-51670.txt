Hello folks.  I am using a Netgear FR314 Hardware Router/Firewall on my DSL
connection.  I have open the ports from 1024 to 7000 for TCP and UDP to the
PC I want to play Everquest from.  I get disconnected a few seconds are
connecting to a world server.  Does anyone have any ideas on what I should
look at doing to get this to behave so I can play?

Thanks in advance.

Greg
