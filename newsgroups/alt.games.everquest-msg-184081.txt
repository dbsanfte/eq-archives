Actually, it can be taught to most to one degree or another.  Learning
through word problems, riddles, types of logic problems, etc... can
develop creative thinking.  Granted, it's not a skill you can reach out
and touch, and define within strict boundaries.  It's a purely mental
skill, but it's useful in almost anything you might be doing - including
game play.

This one's a little harder to nail down.  I think I'll probably just say
that I disagree with you.  I think it's definitely a skill used,
especially when trying to discover trade skill recipes.  I'm certainly
not going to say you have to agree with me. :-)
