News After the Fall of Gukta

by Loral on August 15, 2005

The war of Antonica seems to have ended and our green Froglok friends
find themselves in a new tent-city in south Rathe Mountains. This was a
bit of a surprise conclusion to the war. No one expected that SOE would
change the troll city from back whence it came. I personally expected
part of Freeport to be blocked off for Ykesha and his new men. No doubt
these changes upset the Froggie allies as much as the Troll allies were
angered to lose their city in the first place.

The Frog city has it's charm. It reminds me of Kelethin only lower to
the ground (thank Tunare). One other interesting change, it appears
that Frogloks can now start as necromancers, shadowknights, and rogues.
That adds a bit more flavor to the race and will hopefully help fill
out the low level game with some newer twinks.

The Depths of Darkhollow homepage has been built up with a pretty flash
introduction, the Depths movie, a bunch of screenshots, and pre-order
information. Depths pre-orders have brought up some interesting
debates. For the first time in a while, the free gift for buying the
retail makes it worth running through traffic to buy the box instead of
clicking the "download now" button. The Clockwork Boar, a unique mount
with the same power as a 10,000 plat horse or Drogmar mount, comes
included with the boxed retail version of Depths. Those who either buy
depths in the store or download it will receive a gargoyle monster
shroud.

Many have asked why SOE would offer such a great incentive for a
store-bought purchase when they are no doubt making a bigger profit on
the download. The answer is: boxes on shelves sell EQ. We are horrified
at how well advertisement works, but it works. If SOE can keep EQ on
the shelves with new expansions, SOE gains more customers. Expansions
keep Everquest alive and boxed sales help bring in new players.

For those of us who are happy either way, it won't be fun battling
Tuesday night traffic to get to Best Buy and find out it hasn't hit the
shelves yet. All of my friends will be running around me as wolves
nipping at my boots and hooting while I stand there as my old boring
self.

Of course, it will be worth it for that one time when I am stuck with a
broken down smoking clockwork boar, telling my friend "I think it
slipped a rod".

My friend Gemdiver over at Caster's Realm released some exclusive
Depths of Darkhollow screenshots including a couple I took (that first
double-wolf shot is one of mine). More and more people find the
opportunity to join the Depths of Darkhollow beta. Keep a keen eye on
the forums for chances to join in if testing is your cup of tea
(*ignores the jeers of "but we're all betatesters in EQ you pompous
egotistical loudmouth cleric!"*).

Our friend Zorillius recently announced that the Test server community
would evolve. There are a few advantages to the test server such as
double experience and full veteran rewards. SOE is going to add shorter
reset times on all AAs, easier flagging requirements, and different
boss timers. The most controversial change, however, comes from an
ability for those on Test to invite players on the live servers to copy
their main character over to test.

Test has always been an interesting community. They suffer through a
lot so that we can have a more stable game (*once again ignores the
cynical jeers*) and they don't mind telling you about it. They live
through client bugs that keep them off game for days, encounters that
are far from tuned, and all sorts of strange oddities. They do,
however, get to see some of the latest changes sometimes months before
we do.

Test is a community, however, and they act much like any of the other
servers. To see hoards of copied players rushing in threatens the
community they built. It will be interesting to see how this plays out,
but I expect that SOE needs more players of all levels to help test EQ
and this will solve that need.

Thanks to longtime Mobhunter supporter, Redcloud, we have a couple of
interesting MMO articles to read. A World of Warcraft World takes an
interesting and amusing look at how MMOGs will shape our world. I have
a theory that 50 million players in the US will be playing some sort of
massive online game, whether it be fantasy or football (or both), by
2012. Massive Online Games have changed our world and changed our
lives. We like to say "it's just a game" but I have never played a game
for five years straight that got me to write 3000 words a week in
articles for three different sites. It's just A game but it's also not
just a game at the same time.

Next Generation posted a reprint of The Laws of Online World Design by
yukalale playing SOE big-head thinker, Raph Koster. These are some of
my favorite couch-potato game designer rules that we should all keep in
our head when we critique and ponder this favorite game world of ours.

It appears the Macintosh version of Everquest has risen from the dark
depths. SOE is now offering a free download for the Macintosh version
of Everquest including the base game, Kunark, Velious, Luclin, and
Planes of Power. SOE has had trouble maintaining and supporting the Mac
version of EQ in the past. A while ago we discovered that SOE only had
one developer for the mac version and that developer had left. It will
be interesting to see if this catches on, but they have a lot of work
to do to catch up to the PC version.

Last week I wrote an update of an old article of mine, now titled Why I
Play Everquest 2005. Every six months to a year I like to step back and
really ask myself why I play this game. I think it is a valuable method
to ensure that I continue to have fun and don't ever feel like I'm
wasting my time. It's a bit pompous and perhaps even too high-brow for
me to follow all the time, but hopefully its an entertaining read.

Thus ends this week's news roundup. Keep watching the forums for the
latest happenings.
