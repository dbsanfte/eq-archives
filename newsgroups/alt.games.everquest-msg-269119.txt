Ok so I get a reply that says I should email Sony, and of course you
email them and they say to contact a GM, so....

Well figured why waste my time waiting for another reply. Took me 2
days of hunting to get that far, and all I need is 1 more shard? Why
not just kill the scouts again then get 1 more shard to make up the
difference? So I already have 3 of the 6 totems from scouts that were
up in EJ, SoNH and SBM. I am sure others will pop tomorrow. SHould have
Epic this weekend if all goes well.
