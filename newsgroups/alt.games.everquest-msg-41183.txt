Sure, but if you're going to balk at every action because of repurcussions,
you'd never get anything done.

Its a possibility.  Its also a possibility that if we don't retaliate with
extreme force, our enemies who lack the courage might just find the excuse
they need to join the lets bomb the US band-wagon.

:It could push borderliners over the edge against us.

Are there borderliners?

Yes they are.  They're hypothetical "worst case scenerios" reactions.  We
pay millions of dollars to professional pyschologists to try to figure out
how a foreign culture would react to US actions, and even they can't give an
answer 100% of the time.

:These are very realistic projections.

I'd like to get your source for these projections.
