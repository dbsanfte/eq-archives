I've suspected something in the reverse of this several time in the bazaar.
Several people will have blue leafed agronga whistles at 25k and one guy
will have it at 5k and it's a weapon worth 2k or less.  You just know it's a
guild that is trying to manipulate the gullible in the marketplace with an
apparent awesome deal.  (Btw, that was just an example before everyone heads
off to lucy...)
