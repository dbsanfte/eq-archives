Given you are talking about an example of 5 yearold with aids, the
answer is simple. "I don't know exactly, but he was probably born with
it.". I imagine that would be sufficient for 99.9% of under 7s, without
extending the question to it's logical next step of 'Why was he born
with it? How did his mother catch it?'

If your child sees another child in a wheelchair, and asks why/how, I'm
interested in what your answer would be in that situation, and whether
you would get into the possible medical causes. Would you just give a
'dumbed down' answer of 'his bones don't work properly', 'he was
probably born like that', or would you say 'Looks like a degenerative
disease to me.

What about siamese twins or albinos?

Not saying any of these things are 'the same situation' or even simlar,
just interested in how you'd explain these situations if they arose, and
how AIDS couldn't be treated in the same manner.


nb: I'm not some forward-thinking PC freak before someone throws that
'hit'n'run' at me. Siamese twins rather than co-joined, your-anus rather
than ooranus, bowa-di-ceya rather than boo-dika, disabled not
differently abled. I also don't advocate full disclosure of the world's
nastiness at an age children don't need/want to know the intricate
details. 

I just think that being HIV+ isn't something that should be demonised or
hidden away in a box beneath the stairs with all the other 'bad things'
until they're 18. I think the subject can be acknowledged as existing to
the 3-7 age group in general, and that it can be done so in a way that
will satisfy a child's inherent curiosity about EVERYTHING ( ....but why
Daddy?..but WHY? ) without needing to branch off into related topics
such as sex and drugs before their natural development.
