What about the more casual players or the ones not in guilds? Or the ones 
in smaller family guilds?

Flawed comparison.  Melee have a huge variety of weapons and armor 
available to them, with the best ones coming from high level raid mobs.  
Casters get their gear the same way.
Spell are an entirely different ball of wax.  I think putting "ancient" 
or other special spells as drops off mobs is fine, but I can tell you 
first hand that aquiring especially the L70 spells is an enormous 
headache mostly due to the absurd drop rate.

Players should have more options avaiable to them to get their 70 spells.    
However, since the release of GoD, SoE has apparently decided that unless 
you play EQ 8 hours a day or are extremely lucky, you shouldn't count on 
those spells.

That's great.  Before I retired, I was in a guild that was killing names 
mobs in Riftseekers.... that still doesn't fix the problem that those L70 
spells were rediculously hard to get for the average player.  It really 
shocks me that despite the exodus of players and server merges, SoE 
didn't bother to go back and give the drop rate on those spells a second 
look.
