You don't have to think of it in that direction, the lower level guy 
approving of the higher level use of his item.  Instead, wonder if 
there's a reason that higher level folks might want his lower level 
item; Say a jeweler in New Tanaan wants to see one so he can look at how 
they are made, or say an enemy of the Coldain wants to destroy them by 
tossing them into the fires of Mt Doom.  Or just say that the same guy 
that does the Ornate thing has found a way to create a fantastic new 
ring, but you need an Ornate Ring pattern and a Coldain Ring Ten.

Those aren't well thought out examples, but the point is that there 
could be ways within a new expansion to upgrade things from old 
expansions, and that the people in the story line of the old expansion 
wouldn't have to be changed to make that work.

They did the reverse in some cases; there are quests in POP which ask 
you to go out to several old expansion zones and get items which either 
used to be just vendor junk, or in some cases which never used to drop 
in those zones (I don't remember ever seeing an Icy Geoduck, despite 
leveling several characters in Eastern Wastes... but my post POP 
characters that played there got them all the time, an Uncommon drop at 
worst)  Thats another example of the idea that new content (those nice 
POP focus items) can be used to drive interest in old content (the 
various zones where those items drop)

Oh good, thats been a long time sticking in my craw.  Course this is 
going to be painful for all the players who've skipped their epics 
because they've been superceded... but thats fine, since they can still 
go back and do them if they want.  On the other hand, I hope that SOE 
also goes in and fixes some of the more rediculous inequities in epic 
quests, where some classes (like clerics) got things fixed to where you 
can actually do the quests without a year's wait, others are still 
pretty well busted.  I see some fixes coming to epic drop rates in the 
old Planes, though, so I guess they are looking at that.

Its the same point as your point of getting gear only within the group. 
  The two don't have to go hand in hand, but they could, they are of the 
same sort...

Some people play solo EQ; they don't group, they work on their own, it 
just so happens the world they play in is full of other people who are 
also soloing or who are grouping.

This concept would be like playing a MOG instead of a MMOG; you'd have a 
small pool of players to group with who you know well, the rest of the 
"world" would be just people to talk to, or who are in your way, or who 
might need your help... but you wouldn't look on them as sources of 
goods or cash or as potential grouping partners, sort of like the 
dedicated soloer sees them.

Pay better if you are going to do trade skills or sell in the bazaar, or 
pay better in terms of dropped cash and vendor sellable loot?   And 
easier at what level?  I put it to you that HGs are easy and pay 
decently; there are jobs that are harder and pay better, but for a 
certain level range and gear range, HG are still one of the better ways 
to make some cash safe and easy and without a lot of bother.

I could be wrong though, perhaps you can name several other routes to 
better cash that don't require a group, trade skilling, or setting up in 
the bazzar; I'm certainly no expert, being generally in the "gear 
doesn't matter" camp, I've never put a lot of effort into figuring out 
how to make cash, nor have I spent a whole lot of time on HG's, as they 
tend to be fairly poor exp for the effort even before they go green.

It wouldn't matter if one zone paid more than another if they also 
required different levels of effort; I might prefer an easy job that 
pays $6 an hour to one that's harder but pays $10 an hour.  What I'm 
seeing, though, is that people move naturally to the job thats as easy 
as the $6 an hour but pays as well as the $10 an hour one.  Both the 
earlier jobs are abandoned, because there's now one that pays more than 
the other easy one, and one that's easier than the previous better 
paying one.  Next expansion, there will be one thats as easy as the $6 
one but pays $12 an hour!

There are things in each expansion they use.  But what I'm saying is 
that if your average expansion has say 50 zones, of which people use 
about 40 on a regular basis, then if we are now seeing people use 120 
zones at best, then that's three expansions worth of zones being used. 
The other 230 zones are practically abandoned.  OK, I'll grant that by 
my numbers 70 of those were never really used anyway.  But its still 160 
zones that used to see heavy use and are now deserted.

If something could be done to rekindle interest in those other zones, 
you'd more than double the scope of the game (its now 120 working zones, 
but could be 280 zones worth of worthwhile content).  Now if this has to 
be done with an effort rivaling the effort needed to actually make new 
zones, then that doesn't make a lot of sense.  But most of those old 
zones actually did work and were interesting; if by changing the loot 
tables a bit, or changing the ZEM, or by tying in loot and quest 
materials from those old zones into new content, we could get people 
going back to them with comperably little effort, I think that would be 
a "good thing"

Splendid
