Well remember that they currently do a few things now to "make up" for
the lack of AI. Mob hitpoints are way out of proportion to player hit
points, mobs are made to hit for much more than a player and are given
some really outlandish abilites. Ask any chanter that solos how good a
tank a mob makes. As you level up these differences increase to the
point that things get unworkable. Now basicaly the whole class balance
issue is made unfixable by this method. My point is older games like
EQ are unfixable and we should look to the newer games.
