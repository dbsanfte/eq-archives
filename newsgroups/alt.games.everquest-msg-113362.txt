Yup-that is the place where this particularly nasty corpse retrieval took
place.  After trying several things including one tactic that resulted in
another death, our groupmate was all set to make a suicide run and drag the
body as far as he could and then pick it up on the other side with his alt.
He went over the edge with lev. and clicked his body and started dragging
corpse and what do you know he hooked it and was able to pull it up out of
the pit.

So, the next time someone falls in the spider pit, try this first.
