    Anyone can level up, if they put their mind to it.

    My 41 monk could solo one at 40, and he's not twinked out with expensive
stuff at all. If you split them up with Pacify, you'll be fine.

    If you want to try something easy at first, try the combine ruins. After
you arrive in DL from The Nexus, look for the massive spires. Head to them.
In the middle is a bunch of buildings. One of the buildings in the middle
has a bunch of skeletons in it, "A plaguebone thief". Don't go into the
building to pull them, or you'll be swarmed. Stand outside, and either cast
something on them or shoot them with an arrow. They don't assist one
another, they double hit for about 90 damage per hit, they're level 38 to
40, they run when they get low on life. If you set up your camp on the
grassy hill near the building, you'll find that nothing else dangerous comes
anywhere near you. You could AFK and the only worry would be being trained
by some other knob. The skeletons drop 3-4 pp, bone chips, an outdated quest
item, and the odd research item, so the cash isn't that bad. My 46
necromancer can keep the building empty with a little time to spare, so you
should have plenty to play with. There is one red-con NPC elsewhere in the
ruins, but he stays where he is and you don't need to go anywhere near him.
There's also a wandering skeleton spawn on the far side that can be very
nasty (Wraithbone Champion, hits in the low 100's), and near that wanderer
is a vendor.

    Welcome to the Epic Levels. The good thing about the Epic Levels is you
can very quickly figure out who is an asshat and who isn't based on how much
they whine for you to help with their epic. At later levels it gets tougher.

    The sky is the limit. It might be slow at later levels, but you can
still do them. Avoid PoP - stuff there hits too hard for you to handle in a
duo comfortably. And enjoy the trip.
