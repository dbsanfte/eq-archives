*chuckle*  This would be quite entertaining.  How are you keeping them from
cheating and getting ports?  Having people along the route as checkpoints
that they have to hail or something?

I can also see some people having their buds slap a SLN on them as they run
by, along with a monster SoW or maybe a Wolf Form instead.

A great idea, but I'm real interested in how you are going to police it.
Have a Caster go with each Gnome and follow them to make sure they don't
cheat, and have them bound at Ak'Anon so they can gate back when their
little Gnomie dies?

I can already see a bunch of Gnome corpses on the dock at BB, waiting for
that damned boat.

What server and what time zone ( for the 3pm )?  I may want to watch just
for the pure hilarity of it or even participate if I think the cheaters will
be shut down.  I've been wanting to start a new char on a different server
so this may get me to check one out.

Are you going to guard the Firepot room? It's a loooong swim, but I'm sure
someone would try it. =)
