If OOM is holding you up, why not go to the Nexus and donate for a C3?  I
bet a lot of quadders would tell you it's a huge advantage when quadding and
it shouldn't cost you more than 50pp.  Many enchanters are finding ways to
enchance the duration (using AA skills I guess), so you can probably get a
KEI that lasts 2.5-3 hours or more.
