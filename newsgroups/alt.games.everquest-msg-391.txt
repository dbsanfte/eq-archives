hello all.

I am thinking of getting satillite internet. I know that I have heard
somewhere that they have problems with latency.

My question is this. The one I would be getting is two way satillite, NO
MODEM. The system is called StarBand, it is conjunction with Dishnetworks
satillite TV. Has anyone ever used this, or know about it? Any one know
where I could find good info on this issue? Any help is appriciated.

Thank you
