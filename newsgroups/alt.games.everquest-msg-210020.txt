With PoK, walking to just about anywhere in game becomes quite feasible, 
I do it often.  That said, a red is not likely to be on any raids anyway, 
he's likely to have soloed his way to 65.  Could be done with any number 
of classes, I know I can as a shaman.  I often solo with nothing but self 
buffs, although I do prefer doing so with a KEI.
