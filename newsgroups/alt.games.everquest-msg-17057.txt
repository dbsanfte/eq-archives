Buy GLS from players at 7pp or less.  Do quest.  Sell concordance to
vendors for as much as 9pp.  Profit 2pp per repetition, and significant
exp to boot.  Shake your head and wonder what makes people too
lazy to walk a couple zones for 2pp plus a blue bubble of exp per stone.

I have seen the GLS offered for as little as 3pp each!

Sell GLS for 10pp or do it yourself, until you are over level 13 or
so, the exp you will get off of doing the quest yourself is quite
significant till then, and if you are serious about making money,
its silly to sell for less than you'd get doing the quest yourself.
=============================================
CB Belts:  loot off orc centurians in Crushbone.  Up till level 9 or so,

do the quest and then sell the armor you don't need to wear.
At about this point though carrying backpacks full of the belts for
only a little exp movement becomes prohibitive, now start
selling them for 1pp each to other people's "twinks"... which
is to say second characters they are trying to level up quickly
by throwing money at them.
============================================
Bone chips:
Find a high level wizard to give you a "push" (Translocate) to
the Toxxulia forest ("Tox"), go into the newbie area of Paineel,
and spend some time farming the ludicrous quantities of skeletons
there.  They are level one, and can be easily slain by anyone
even that low in level.  If you are higher level than that you
will be able to ammass stacks of bone chips with almost no effort,
there is only one mob in this zone that will attack you normally,
a level 4 necro pet.  If you happen to kill him, get an erudite
necro to loot the body, the item is for a quest for them that is
useless to you.

Bone chip stacks sell very easily in GFay, due to a nice quest in
Kaladim for lots of exp and faction, people will literally buy
backpacks full of the things
=========================================
Learn pottery (an inexpensive skill to master up into the
low hundreds), go to Thurgadin, and auction to sell
Pie Tins and Pots.  Believe it or not, you can get 100pp
for these items from high level people who don't care
to spend the time mastering the skill for just these two
pieces, which they will need once in their lives.
==========================================
Get 50pp or so.  Go to a distant and high level zone that
you can still traverse safely, such as SK or Rathe Mountains.
Auction banker in the zone, will buy your silver and copper
with my pp.  You should make a killing off the exchange rate.
(This is best for druids and wizards who can port to near a bank,
then gate back to the "banking" zone to repeat)
===========================================
Go to zones with Lore items that are not no drop.  Wander around,
loot all unlooted bodies.  While this is a good practice in general,
its -very- lucrative in a place like Eastern Wastes, where you can
pick up Walrus Tooth or Orc Fang Neclace worth 50pp each
on the open market just because everyone in the hunting party
already has one on them... especially handy are solo druids, who
are killing 4 mobs at a swat and can only loot one of each lore
item for their whole "party" of one. (This tactic best for rogues,
although any class with invis or sow and a lot of caution can pull it
off)
==========================================
Gain the trust of high level players.  Offer to sell thier items for
them in exchange for a cut of the profit.  At low levels you can
quite happily hunt in EC while occaisionally hitting your auction
key, and pull in a lot of cash for yourself.  At first you'll be
selling junk worth 5pp or so (so you are making under 2pp
on your share) but once you've demonstrated an ability
to deliver (and not run off with the goods) you'll be selling
in the hundreds (and pocketing in the tens)

For real big ticket items, trust isn't even a component.  Get
all the stats on the item including which classes and races
can use it, and auction to sell... if you find a buyer hook him
up with the owner, who never let it out of his inventory.  10%
of a 5Kpp sale will see you set for cash till you are in your
20s!

(advanced play)You don't even need to get the deal in advance.
While  hanging in EC, keep an eye out for some of those high end
items. They don't sell often.  Make a note of the sellers name.
Later, when he's in a different zone, send him a tell with a price
check.  If he still has it, start auctioning it yourself for a little
more
than he was asking.  If you happen to get a buyer, contact him
again and broker the deal.  Hope he is honest, because the buyer
will be paying him in exchange for the item, and he should then
give you your cut.
