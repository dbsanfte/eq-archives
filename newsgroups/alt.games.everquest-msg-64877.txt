DAOC will run in all its graphics glory, in a 128 meg p500 with an
origional Geforce card.    apparently for luclin to be run max out you
need 512 megs of memory and a geforce 3 and probably atleast a 1 ghz
processor.

some difference there. and shows how EQ has not been well constructed
to scale up.
