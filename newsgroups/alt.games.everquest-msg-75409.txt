The damage on the wurm is 25/40 primary only.  The Short Sword of Morin is
6/22.  I'm finding that no websites give the primary / secondary slot in their
info.  So when trying to purchase a new secondary weapon i am sending tons of
/tells - only to find out that the weapons that sound really great are primary
only or way out of my price range, (which is around 1300 plat).
