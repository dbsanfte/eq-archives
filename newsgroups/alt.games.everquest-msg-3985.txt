On the same note...
What if I have a character on one account that I want to move to a new
account?  I have two characters I want to play at the same time.  I am
willing to pay for the second game and account, but is it possible to have
it moved to a new account or am I going to have to start that character all
over again?
Has anyone had any luck with this?
