Check http://eq.castersrealm.com under the Shaman section.  Look under
spells, and then click on each one.  in the description, it should tell you
where to get them.  I haven't visited luclin or tried teh kitties, so I
can't tell you where on Luclin.  Also, check www.eqatlas.com for spell
vendor locations and maps.
