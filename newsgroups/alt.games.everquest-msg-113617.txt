I just started an Iksar Monk and had a few questions.  I've heard the whole
discussion about weight and AC with monks, but at what specific point does
your AC start going down?  From 1 and up, or is it 19 like I've heard?  Does
that ever go up with levels?  How do some of you that run monks deal with
looting?  Just pick up the important stuff you know will sell, or don't pick
up anything at all?

Also what is this about Monks dropping aggro etc?

Also, I tried buying a 1hb weapon and equipped it and my attack lowered
significantly from when I was just going h2h, bare fisted both hands.  How
do you know what weapons will raise your actually combat damage?

Again, thanks in advance.  I sometimes enjoy reading this newsgroup almost
as much as playing the game.
