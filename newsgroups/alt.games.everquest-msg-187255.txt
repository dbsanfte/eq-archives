Not that I have ANYTHING to add to this "interesting" exchange of
ideas...I just wanted to say I have struggled somewhat with a 59
Cleric friend to make headway in PoD.  I am a 60 Necro myself and we
have had to zone frequently due to the HARSH nature of the mobs in
PoD.  Thankful for the ready rez that my friend can provide, we
haven't lost too much (yes I have LOST exp not gained since I have
attempted this place). Now since I don't give up easy, we have kept at
it.  Each kill we HAVE actually managed has been very disappointing in
terms of EXP!?  I don't SEE the bar moving at all, and for the effort
one must expend, the summons, the 300+ double attacks, the nasty DoTs,
60 pet getting ruled, CH's being chain casted, and not to mention the
ability for the mobs to be resistant to fear, its quite frustrating.
Now to be sure we are not POWER players.  I have what most would call
mid level gear, but I have worked hard to get where I am and I think I
am well familiar with the right tactics for my character.

Now frankly, I'm new to PoP so I must be patient (and ask for yours in
responding).  Gotta learn before we conquer.  But would someone please
tell me what we are doing wrong.  Where is this wonderful EXP I am
missing?  Just some helpful comments please.  What Mobs is this EXP
restricted to if any?  How does it go better without having to expend
a full bar of mana, a pet, and a peridot or two to make it worth it?
