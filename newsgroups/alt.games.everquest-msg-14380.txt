Thanks Dan. I'm not a beta tester of the game, so I can only go by what I've
read. I realise that there is a certain PVP element to the game, but from
what I'm hearing it's not a very large part of gameplay. Again, I could well
be wrong though.

Here's what I was going by, and this is from the official (in progress)
manual that is accessible here: http://community.anarchyonline.com/manual


************begin cut and paste**************

Combat is a major part of the game. Through combat, you gain
experience-points, earn credits, and collect "loot" (whatever equipment and
items a monster carries). And combat is fun - both alone and in teams.

You can only fight monsters. There are exceptions: in certain areas and
Arenas, you can attack and be attacked by other players. These areas are
specially marked, and you will be informed upon entering an area that this
is a a "player versus player" (PvP) area.
