Yeah. It can be a pissed. One of my best online friends, the kindest
most helpful serene person I have ever met, in game or out, had chosen
"Perl Jamming" and got petitioned at level 60 after a long time playing.

She was pretty upset about it, but it was obviously a violation so
what can you do?

Of course, 20 minutes running past "Tankee Bigbollox" (no joke) and
"Quickee Kumsqwik" on the same server really makes you think about the
way they enforce the rule. As they currently only appear to act on player
reports it makes it pretty much a tool for petty revenge and nothing else;
without proactive enforcement the environment is already continuously
polluted from a high fantasy perspective, making the rule a pretty nasty
way of spoiling someones day.

Be nice if there was some kind of in game link to the policy - or even a
dump of it before you use /surname so those of us who dont read the
entire sony website start to finish before starting a new game dont choose
something destined to be removed.

Yeah, thats not as far fetched as it sounds. Perl soloed for her first 27
levels or so , and really didnt know about it. Ahh well.

Sigh,
