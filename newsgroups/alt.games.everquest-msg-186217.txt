It's not Bush 100% , I feel he is the rider on the white horse of Rev 6

Alas as long as wars keeps on breaking the "love your enemy" the whole world
will be dragged into Revelations kicking and screaming

It's a sad paradox : Evil keeps on growing until it is TOTALLY destroyed,
the ONLY one who can TOTALLY destroy evil is the rider on the white horse of
Rev 19 Jesus

another paradox : evil doesn't listen to reason it just gets more and more
evil , the only way to defeat evil is by overwhelming force > Jesus is the
overwheliming force ulitmatly

As for nuking : evil forces ( Iran Iraq N Korea ) that option upon it's self
through it's nature, the problem is USA is made to look like the enemy by
defeating evil forces, whence the truth shows USA has no intentions to be
the oppressor but the liberator

The nature of godless people is to become evil by not submitting to their
creator
