Yes, but there's a certain lack of precision in measuring large quantities
of exp with such a small range of pixels.  And then there are the areas
between bubbles and at the ends.

The bar is (quick break to measure it on a screenshot) 65 pixels across.

That means each bubble is 13 pixels across.

So one pixel = 1.5% (yellow) or 0.3% (blue) of the required exp.  Roughly.

So to move that blue bar one pixel, a level 50 human warrior has to get
around 275000 points of exp.  To put that in perspective, that much exp will
take a level 1 character to level 7, almost 8.  And that's just one blue
pixel.
