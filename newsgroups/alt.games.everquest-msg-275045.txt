The problem is that you have no way of knowing whether a quest is
soloable or not when you start it.  You don't even know if what you are
being asked to do will lead to a reward or if it will just lead to
another step.  For example the heritage quest for the lightstones
starts off very easy - all you need to do is run around the commonlands
a bit.  After killing the lion it becomes un-soloable until you get to
level 35 (a rough guess I'm only 26 at the moment).  I *now* know that
the heritage quests are special quests and that I'll probably never be
able to solo any of them but at the time I was doing it I didn't have
this knowledge.

The quest to access Cauldren Hollow is the same - nice and easy up
until you need to kill a fairy queen.  I think that she cons as groupx2
(not sure about that though - she's definately NOT solo).  Again I had
no idea about the level of this quest until I came to stop with the
queen.

I could (and have on occaision) look up the quests on the internet but
I don't think that I should need to - I'd rather complete them on my
own.  I have found out that the lightstone heritage quest actually
needs access to bloodskull valley and a raid in there to complete it.

What would really improve the soloing on EQ2 in my mind is for quests
to indicate whether they are solo quests or not.  With that info I
could do solo quests with the LFG flag on until I get a group.  I hate
standing around looking for a group.  Killing solo mobs is quite dull
and I can jump off the bridge in Nek forest only so many times to raise
my safe fall skill before that becomes too dull.
