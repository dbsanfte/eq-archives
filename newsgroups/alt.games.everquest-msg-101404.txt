All of this speculation on where the extra $3 is going seems silly 
to me. It's probably going to be divided up between several accounts 
on the balance sheet. There is one question and one question alone 
that is relevant with regard to this price increase:

Is Everquest (warts and all) worth $12.95/month to me?

My answer is yes. There are plenty of reasons one might say no:
burned out on the game, they always patch during my play time,
customer service sucks, etc.

But it seems like every "I'M QUITTING!" rant posted here either
rails on about (1) paying more but not getting more, and/or 
(2) greedy Verant making more profit.

Point (1) is an unfounded assumption that NONE of this extra 
income is going toward improving the game. Look at all the 
improvements we've gotten over the past three years *without* 
any price hikes. I'd say their track record is pretty good.

Point (2) seems to be a phenomenon of the Internet era: the
lynch mob shows up to crucify any company that dares make a
profit. OMG! They're making a profit! Their execs might be
getting a pay raise out of this! Those bastards! They're 
screwing us! Good lord. Haven't people learned from the 
dot-com debacle yet?
