No more than the letter H by itself should be pronounced "huh" rather 
than "aich". ;)

I'm not so sure about that. I've alway thought a Q without a U should be 
pronounced like a K. I learned it either by rule or by observation, I 
don't know which, but either would serve to validate the practice.

Bah. Mine worked well enough for me. Regardless, I can't see where anyone 
can honestly say it sucks as a whole. We seem to produce our fair share 
of educated professionals and otherwise contributing members of society 
in general. Let's not fall into the trap of criticizing yet another facet 
of American culture just to be fashionable.
