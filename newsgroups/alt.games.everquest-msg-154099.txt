People like me writing letters because I spent enough time with Rage
and VS watching how these clowns wait till your raid is about to about
to engage and they go in manaburning.

Anybody on the receiving end of high end manaburners knew this day
would come.

What I am looking forward to is all the lowlife wizards on my server
who have pissed away their reps thinking with manaburn they no longer
had to have lots of online friends and allies to help them with high
end MoBs. My guild hasn't forgotten their names. Enjoy PoP.  :-P
