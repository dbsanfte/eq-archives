Hahahaha.
All this downtime is really an insolence,another clear sign,
they dont take their customers seriously.
Didnt they promise some weeks ago,that they will
only publish fully tested patches? - empty promises.
For 17.95 Euro a month I would expect a full-time
service with no downtime how I got it from my
Bank,never did I saw the online banking site 
or ATM mashine down,and this for *zero* fees.
Too bad we live in the stone age of MMORPGS and there
are no (real) competitors or they wont get through with this.

Mheldur (pretty annoyed)
