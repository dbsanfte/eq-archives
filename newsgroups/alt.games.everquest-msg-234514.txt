I have a bag that I carry around in which I keep cool insta-click items.
Some of these have real utillity (e.g., my Shaman Epic-piece Black Fur
Boots) and others are somewhat whimsical.

I haven't been able to figure out how to search for this special class of
item either in the bazaar or Allakhazam. Is anyone familiar with a good list
(or search technique) for locating a list of all insta-click items in the
game?

BTW, by insta-click, I mean items whose special abilities are described as
"(Casting Time: Instant)" in the item description. These items can be
activated in almost any situation without wearing or equipping the item and
even while running.

Thanks
