This is always the trouble with accumulating wealth; do you spend a 
little now on something small, or save up for something big later... and 
have nothing now?

With LDoN, there's an odd twist to this (its true IRL and in regular 
cash based EQ, not true in a DKP environment), which is that as you 
level up, you'll get far more points per LDoN.

So, at level 30 it might take you 50 missions to get 150 points, but at 
level 60 it might take you 5 missions to get the same 150 points.

This means that that 150 points you are thinking of spending doesn't 
necessarily mean nearly as much work to replace as you might think; 
spend them all now, and 10 levels later you'll be able to replace them 
in half the time it took you the first time.

=================================================================
Another concern, though, is that you seem to be misunderstanding just 
how LDoN point spending works (maybe not, but it looks that way).

You see there are two factors involved in spending points.  One, the 
simple one, is that you have to have the points to spend.  See a 150 
point item, only have 120 points to your name?  You can't buy it.  Have 
180 points, you -can- buy it, and then you only have 30 points left, so 
you can't buy another 150 point item till you earn more.

But the other, more complicated factor, is that there are 5 different 
mission themes, and in each theme, you cannot buy any item more 
expensive than your total points earned in that theme.

So if you, for example, have done
50 Mistmore
40 Takish
30 Rarijul
20 Miragul
and zero Guk

And have spent no points at all, then you have 140 points total to 
spend, but can't buy any items that cost more than 50 points, and that 
only in Mistmore (vendor at Butcherblock); you can only spend 40 points 
at most per item in Takish, 30 in Rarijul, and 20 in Miragul, you can't 
buy anything at all in the Deepest Guk list (S Ro. vendor)

But you could buy 2 50 point items in Mistmore, even though that would 
be 100 points spent there, the limit isn't reduced when you buy something.

Each of the different camp has different items in it.

So, in addition to your class (*which you told us) we'd have to know 
your level, what sort of gear you have, and where your various points 
have been earned, insofar as spending limits are concerned.

SInce 150 points is pretty small, really, you might not find a lot of 
help here even with all that information provided, most of AGE 
discussion tends towards a higher level of play.  I wager, however, that 
someone -will- at least post locations of web sites where there are 
searchable lists of all items available; plug in your class and take a 
look at what you might want to save up for.

Personally, I was working twoards a mage item which improves pets cast 
from the 50 to 60 range, but I didn't work particularly hard on it, and 
now I'm clearly going to be level 61 long before reaching the point 
where I can buy it; the item will be useless to me before I can get it. 
  I've bought the chest spells, which have come in handy exactly zero 
times (have had all of three opportunities to try them at all, and its 
never ended up being an int caster chest), and a level 39 summoned item 
which grants see invis in the ammo slot.

Even at my level, as a mage, I just don't see much reward to the LDoN 
points thing, its more a matter of a bit of icing on the cake; from 30 
to 55, however, there was no better exp in the game (well there was, but 
it was hard to find group openings for it, and dead easy to find LDoN 
groups)
