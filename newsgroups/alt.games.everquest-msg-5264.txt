Oh, right, the error log file.  I forget the name of the file though...do a
File Find on *.log and look for the one last modified that day.  I think I
did get a sharing violation but I never did figure it out.  What you
actually should to is read it enough to see what just the text on the
right-hand side says, then post it in the Win2k newsgroup for help...I bet
you'll get the answer there.  I went to the Knowledge Base but couldn't
figure it out.  microsoft.public.win2000.general or .hardware
