Probably missing something obvious here, but I was trying to experiment
with this new chat thingey this weekend with my group. The list of help
selections didn't look that helpful.

After I create a channel for my raid party (/join Jakuggsraid: password)
and have everyone else join, how do we make that the "default" chat
choice? (i.e. so everything I type normally will go out in that channel
instead of my normal default of /group or /guild, et.)  The channels are
a HUGE improvement for mixed guild raiding parties, but it's a pain to
have to type every message with a prefix of "/1 <msg>".  Particularly
when it's a fast moving raid with a ton of mobs coming in. Resetting the
hotkeys for this is easy enough, but for those general raid commands,
("DON'T push the PoZ over the WALL!!!") I'd rather not have to futz
around with it.
