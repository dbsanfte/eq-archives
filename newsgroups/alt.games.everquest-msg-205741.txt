Rathe Mountains is good loot on the giants... they drop anywhere from copper
to about 55pp i think.... plus most drop fine steel.  On Povar tho it is
overcamped.  Another good loot zone is PoN at the stalkers as they have been
known to drop various forms of diamonds pretty frequently..... Went there
for about 4 hours and walked out with 8k total split among the group.
