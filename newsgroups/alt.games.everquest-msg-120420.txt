Focus Earrings reduced mana use on DD's.  One of the best focus items in
many mage's opinions as the reduction was fairly good.

Too powerful??  Hardly.  It's not like we could be fighting 4 mobs at the
same time, IE druid quad kiting.  Also, in many situations if mages just
just leave their pets to do all the work, it comes back very beat up, and we
have to wait till its healed again.  As it was before, it was very in
effectient to solo as a mage because we'd end up wasting most of our mana
trying to out nuke the pet, and then we'd have to med for ages.  All this
will do is reduce our med time by a little bit, and our pet heal time by a
bit more depending.

Probably because Dire Charmed pets are usually the most powerful pets in the
game, and they are unbalancing in many peoples opinions.  Really, this isn't
much of a big thing anyway.

Yes, many people use this spell, mostly mages.  We have about 15 or more
class specific items that cast this spell.  It gives back some mana, so you
might as well.
