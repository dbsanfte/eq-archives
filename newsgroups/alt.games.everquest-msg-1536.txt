performing binds is just a grateful thing to do.  I play mostly melee
classes.  I've asked many times for others to help out with a bind.  too be
honest, i never did pay or offer up a token for it.  tho, I've offered gifts
to low lever players in zone when I have stuff to give.  I dont necessarily
give just for the hell of it either.  If I see a char that can use an item
or two, sure, then i give it to them.  the same has been done to me in the
past.

Too be honest, you wont start making real coin until you hit 25lvl.  That is
what I've found with my characters.  When I was able to hunt in zones like
Unrest, Cazic, Upper Guk, then I was making coin from all the drops.  coin
in outer zones really SUCKs.  Some places can offer up some decent cash but
not for long.  What then comes into consideration is the XP VS coin.  too be
honest, xp is more important for me upto 30.

IMHO,
be patient, learn your char...learn it's weaknesses and strengths.  your
better off in the long run.
