These skills are independant of each other, what matters is
your attack rating, which is a function of offense, skill in the current
weapon, and any attack buffs you may have on.  (is there any
stat that influences attack?  Haven't ever tested)

To test this theory out, write down your attack with one weapon
form, then switch weapon types, and write down that form
as well.  Now fight till your skill goes up.  Check attack, that
will have gone up.  Swap back in your original weapon and
check again.  Didn't go up, right?  OK, now fight till your
offense goes up.  Take a peek at attack with both weapons
armed... went up in each case didn't it?

Since your skill with your usual weapon often caps out early,
you may want to swap in a very fast weapon even if its of
another type, in order to give you more shots at increasing
your offense; like weapon skills, offense is checked every time
you swing, so those of us who delight in big slow tools find
themselves on the short end of the stick.

A related note: many classes work hard on not being hit.
Unfortunately, your defense skill goes up only while you
are getting beat on.  AC is based on what you are wearing,
any AC buffs, and your Defense skill.  As a cleric, this
realization meant I needed to go solo light blues for
quite a while in my high 30's low 40s, in order to catch
up in defense, if I'd made more of a point of getting some
of the aggro in groups since birth this would have been
much easier.

Yes, with Evade and good management your rogue
shouldn't have to take much abuse... but if you care
at all about your AC, you need to make a point of
-not- doing this in situations where its safe to
take some damage.  Ideal for this if you have high level
friends would be to get some powerleveling help;
with massive AC/HP buffs, possibly Regeneration
too, you will be able to withstand quite a pounding
while you solo stuff and suck up exp and other skill
increases.  I've been soloing the crocs in Oasis with
my rogue unbuffed (but somewhat twinked) in order
to get defense up; nice thing about them is that they
don't frenzy, so you only have to fight one at a time,
and they do run, so even if you are neck and neck for
damage with them you will likely win if you hold out
long enough.  Another approach would be to get
a partner who isn't going to function as main tank,
and tank for the group.  Yes, you'd do more damage
fear kiting or with someone else as main tank, but
you need the practice in being hit.
