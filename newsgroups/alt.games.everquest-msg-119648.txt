That's definately a new one, but doesn't surprise me. They can report
you for not loaning the sword 'til they're blue in the face if they
want, but the most it will get them is an irritated guide or GM
telling them to stop wasting the guides' time. There are absolutely no
rules that say you have to loan out anything to anyone, and even
"etiquette" doesn't require it. In fact, the little scammer you ran
into was closer to breaking rules by far and most definately breaching
"game etiquette".

Just in general, if you have something good, twerps will try various
methods to get you to give it to them. They're idiots. There's a
wonderful command: /ignore. Just place the twerp's name after it, and
you won't see anything more they say. YOu'll still see them standing
in front of you, but "muted". ;-)
