Really it depends a lot on the level of the guild.  Many younger [leveled]
guilds will concentrate on raising the average lvl overall while raiding
once twice a week.  The raiding allows them to get the process and tactics
down while leveling allows then to increase the complexity of the raid as
they progress.  My guild on the other hand usually raids four or so days a
week with 1 or 2 days going to XP and 1 or 2 days going to keying and
flagging.  My guild is a raiding guild however and usually bring 40-50
players with an average lvl of 63 to a raid.
