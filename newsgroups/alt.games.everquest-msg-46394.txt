Also, Looting will cause S/H to break.  When sneaking in hostile areas, use
the "c" key to con Mobs as "right click" may make you accidentially loot
something or inspect someone and cause your hide to break.

If you are facing a MOB that is very much higher than you, sneak / hide may
not work.  However,  the sneak portion of S/H is more reliable if you can
stay behind the MOB.  You can sneak / hide behind even "see invis" mobs as
long as they don't turn around.

S/H breaking is also dependant on distance, the farther you are away from a
mob and the speed at which you are moving has some bearing on whether or not
the MOB will argo.
