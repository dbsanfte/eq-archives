KEI is not clarity 3, whatever people might call it on your server. There is
no such spell as "Clarity III".

KEI is a combination of increased mana regeneration (14 per tick, a tick
being 6 seconds) and an increase of 25 to WIS and 25 to INT.

It is referred to as "crack" only because its level of demand from
non-enchanters who use mana (and enchanters who can't cast it yet) is on par
with very high-end physical addictions. It is even useful to the
mana-challenged, as it helps with increasing your tradeskill levels.
