"The games need to be something you can do casually, in an evening for
an hour or less," he said.(Richard Garriot)

The log in process needs to be shortened and simplified by
a great amount,I am a "hardcore" player,but sometimes
I prefere to do other things,cause I think of the annoying
5 minutes before I can actually play the game,always reminds
me of switching on an ancient cathode tube TV,except I
could switch the TV on and forget it,while in EQ I have to
make bothersome input on top of the waiting time.
