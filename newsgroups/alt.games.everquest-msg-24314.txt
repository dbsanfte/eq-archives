Sow requests have never bothered me (well, since level 20 anyway, when SoW
didn't cost so much mana).  Even if they say "plz" *shudder* I'll usually
give it to them if they're next to me.  And I've never felt guilty about
saying "sorry, not going that way," to port requests.  I've never had a
problem with ignoring (not /ignore) folks who persist in trying to talk me
into going out of my way (most of the time they say "plzzzzzz????" and have
NO idea how easy it is for me to ignore them when they use that assinine
abbreviation).

I don't really have a problem with saying "no" most of the time.  That dates
back to my bill collector days I think.  I think I'm in the minority though.
*I* think druids and enchanters who always go into hiding hate the
possibility of a confrontation...it just doesn't bother me that much since
it's only a game.  IRL I'll be the first to avoid it if I have any choice.

God, RV is DEFINITELY worse that GFay when it comes to beggars.

Coincidentally?  I think not. :)
