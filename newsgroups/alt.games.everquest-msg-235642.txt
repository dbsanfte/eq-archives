All I'm saying is that really, at face value, there is nothing that
bizarre about. Its certainly not the life *I* would want to be a part
of. But we tolerate many lifestyles that I, at least, consider equally
strange...

There are no religious fanaticisms, no permanent control schemes -
(people may leave, people do not have to sever ties with others,
people do not have to tithe all their belongings, everyone is a
willing participant with the option to leave... if you take what he
says to be true then its not a cult.

Its certainly valid to question his honesty, that is my own greatest
misgiving about the whole situation. But for the sake of argument, if
he is being upfront, then I think it would be premature to dismiss him
as a nut.
