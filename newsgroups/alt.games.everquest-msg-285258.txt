The funny thing is - there are folks on the WoW forums predicting
the death of WoW due to changes in the upcoming expansions.  They
boil down to "What, I can't have a mod play half my character for 
me?  Healers will quit in droves!  WoW is doomed!"  (I paraphrase,
but the gist is there.)

It's probably the same on the CoH forums and the DaoC forums and,
honestly, any other MMO forum in existence when a change is made.
