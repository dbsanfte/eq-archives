My enchanter is 59.  Except for raids the game strategy is so damned close
to what it was at level 16 it isn't even funny.

In the vast majority of experience camps you don't even need a warrior,
cleric, enchanter or monk.  The only difference that I can think of is that
there's many camps where SOMEONE had better well be slowing the critter if
you don't have a cleric, but besides that...*shrug*...same thing.

Yeah, fine, raids are different, but I've yet to see any major difference
between a good vox/naggy raid (admitedly an oxymoron) and an "end game" raid
(admittedly, I'm not in an "end-game" guild, but I've farted around with
some).  Well, one major difference...people know what the hell they're doing
at 55+ (for the most part...there's still a scary number of level 60
non-EBay accounts where the player is an absolute moron), and the only
difference between 55+ and 60 is added abilities, NOT added skill.
