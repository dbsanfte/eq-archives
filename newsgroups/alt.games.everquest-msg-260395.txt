I spit on Luclin. :( I was looking through old screenshots of the days
"before Lucy" and I was floored by the happy memories and nostalgia they
brought up.  OK, so if it weren't for Luclin I'd never have quit my druid
and I wouldn't have started a ranger, but I'd honestly be willing to deal
with Foxeye the Druid and Uuurha the dark elf warrior (my two chars before
Luclin) if it meant the SOE devs wouldn't have lost whatever magic it was
that made the velious era so wonderful.

And imagine if the post-velious releases had not only maintained that
magic, but if the character model upgrades had had the creativity and
grace of the Lineage 2 models (minus the anime style and alpha mapping
that limits customizability)....

...as someone once said on this group, MMORPGASM.
