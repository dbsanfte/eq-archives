Dont worry about that, you better hope you dont get 200 skill, it seems 
like the chance of breaking poles increase DRASTICALLY at 200 skill.

Broken poles from 150 to 200 skill = 8
Broken poles in the next 2 hours after dinging 200 = 9

No noticeable difference in getting rares, just more pole breaks. Can be helped by getting the Fishermans Companion though. Now i just need a summon bait item.
