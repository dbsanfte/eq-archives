I did. I figured my weakest link (I have friends who play EQ fine with
lesser specced machines than mine) was the modem.
And it's less than 2 years old and plays other games just fine -
Wolfenstein, Diablo2, Ghost Recon and more.
I've got ALL the latest drivers (first thing I tried) and ME was last
re-installed about a year ago (and EQ).
So with $50 bucks a year I could throw in some more ram but sure as shit I
bet it won't fix my lag playing EQ.
