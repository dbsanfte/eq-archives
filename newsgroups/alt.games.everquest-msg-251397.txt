Lets take the average normal collect Ldon in which you
kill around 50 mobs.
Mobs last around 1 minute,they hit for max 370 or so,
I see clerics casting Complete Heal usually once and
a minor heal too.
This means the mob deals out around 5k or 6k damage.
Lets say the average hit is 250,then we have 20 hits,so
Shield of Thorn will produce 480 damage per mob.
Now with the upped duration of 15 minutes this means
I get 7200 damage for 120 mana only !
