Yes i parse procs and spells for melees.  I don't include casters in my dps
comparisons :)  Typically their total damage is half of mine, and their DPS
is double mine ;)

This is just "boss" mobs.

No they aren't.  my specific parsing examples was 3 named mobs in Qvic.  We
kill all 3 in 40-50 mins, not particularly fast, but not too slow that discs
can all refresh.  The difference is closer than the difference with the
number 1 rogue versus number 2 monk.

Thats crap.  Wa5 makes me proc more, it makes you proc more. My extra agro
is offset by your extra agro. It does not a damn thing for my net agro gain.

Well no, we have warriors tank... rarely paladins can sub in when warriors
die.. most people get 1 rounded in GoD
Rangers have tanked "fun" stuff though.. named in potime phase 1-2, the end
bosses of phase 3 etc.  Potime is gimp though, for the past 6 months i was a
designated starting tank in 2 trials every week.

> Nukes = resisted by most raid mobs and usually lower dps.

But when they don't get resisted, its still 1-2k more damage than I can cast
with spells..

> Heals = hahahaha

Better than nothing!   1.2k crit or so, for a rangers best heal?

> Root = how unique
> Snare = how unique

Both immensly powerful still. I'd love both spells on my monk.. any day.

> Good range damage, yep, useful for 2% (number pulled out of ass) of
fights?

Good ranged damage when you can't get in close to melee (rules out any dps
from monks and rogues), in addition to orgasmic ranged dps every 1 hour...

> Harmony = how unique and resisteable (unlike FD and monk lull), has a
level

Well lull is limited to 1 mob, and you can't keep 1 mob chain lulled.  Its
also capped at 65 too.  it also doesnt land on 99.9% of mobs i pull.

> Buffs = SoP and CotR, SoT to the odd one or two people.

Every melee class wants those buffs though.

I eagerly await proof of warriors outdamaging rangers in any sort of generic
environment
