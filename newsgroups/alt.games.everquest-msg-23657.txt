I'm almost a level 9 neutral barbarian shaman and I feel like the exp is
kind of slow.  Right now, I'm fighting in BB unless the training is
really bad and then I go into Qh and solo any rare blue I can find.  Is
this really, the only thing I can do right now? Black burrow?  If anyone
knows a better place for exp, I'd like to hear it.  The pathing in BB is
so screwed up on this server is mind boggling, I just saw a train of
about 25 gnolls run across a bridge.  I thought it was lag that made
them run by twice, but everyone in the zone was talking about it.  It
was crazy.  Thanks in advance.
