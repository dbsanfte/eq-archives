I have no personal experience with this, as the only time I've been AoE'd has
been by something already pretty pissed at me.  But several months ago, there
was discussion about how irritating it was to get put on the hate list after
being hit with an AoE.  Was this a myth or did Verant change something?

Even after getting non-KoS with Wuoshi I've been paranoid about porting in,
afraid I'd get hit with an AoE and added to his hate list.  I was almost
*positive* people were whining about this on the message boards... of course,
they could have been wrong/horribly misinformed.  (*gasp* but never on
whineplay...)
