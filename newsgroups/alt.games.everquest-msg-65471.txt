Just to defend Mythic a bit. In EQ, alter planes came out quite a bit 
later after release. Until Kunark and Velious, there were two places 
where people could decently level in their high 40ies -- Sol B and Guk. 
And I do remember times when people would wait for 3 hours and more on 
waiting lists for groups in Sol B and Guk.
So yeah, DAOC has little high level content yet as well :)

Both of these have been fixed recently. I'm not nitpicking, I'm sure 
there are other problems. But Mythic is fixing them very fast

Why flanking? Because weaker tanks will not make it through you without 
taking very substantial damage. Because you don't want other team's 
casters near your healers. Because a caster will die in 1-2 rounds 
against a decent tank
