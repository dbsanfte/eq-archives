Of course. But the fail modes on quests are really usually quite stupid.

The item doesn't drop. Faction consistency issues. The combine doesn't 
work. The items are to big to fit in the container provided for the 
combine. The container doesn't have enough slots. The items are lore and 
you need more than one of a particular one. The NPC doesn't return an 
item you need later on. etc etc etc... these are all automatically 
testable.

Somethings that aren't testable:

Names of items, appropriateness of flavour text, names of NPCs, and 
things of that sort as you don't insert "object links" into the flavour 
text. (You -could- but you don't... you don't always want the flavour 
text to say see "Ask [Wilemena Bupkill] for more info".  Often the quest 
designer wants to put a slight riddle in it or make it a clue instead of 
precise directions...e.g. Fred Efelstein "See my Sister for more 
info"...and the player is supposed to scour the world for female npcs of 
the right race with right last name...and ask them about fred or hand 
them the turn in or something. Or Worse the player is supposed to 
stumble on some NPC drop wedding invitation for a Wilemena Efelstien 
that was recently married to Stogar Bupkill, and now the player is 
finally clued in that they are supposed to locate Wilemena Bupkill...

Now the quest design tools will of course indicate that the npc required 
is Wilemena Bupkill, and can validate that she spawns, and responds 
correctly etc. What the tool won't be able to do is verify that the 
static text in the clue is a good hint. If the designer fucks up and 
puts writes the Wedding invitation text about Marie Effelsteen getting 
married the clue is screwed up and the tool can't validate it. And of 
course, for the players to find that Wilemena Bupkill is the right NPC 
would likely only ever be found by brute force trying every female npc 
in the game, because they'll *never* find Marie Bupkill.

This sort of thing can't really be validated automatically. But more 
often than not the errors are of a variety which can be detected by 
tools.

Agreed. But I never said it was *that* simple. :)
