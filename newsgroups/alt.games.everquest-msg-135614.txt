    Oh, no - I'm not shaking my fist at them saying "those bastards!" I'm
just saying that once they killed it, it would re-spawn during their time
frame and they'd kill it again (we'd kill it if we saw it up). So it rarely
left their time frame. Lord, they're entitled to whatever they find up! The
"it's quite easy" refers to the RoS itself. We've done it with 20-odd
people - you actually resist most of the AoE waves, and the final slime
isn't tough (I think he's slowable IIRC - I know he doesn't hit hard enough
to require more than a 10 second CH chain, and that usually means slowable).

    Our main competition, Vis, also had this "time-locked" in a way - they
knew exactly when it would pop, and were always there for it because some of
the loots are really spectacular. Then one day we found where they dragged
the "timer corpse" they were using to track when they'd last killed it, and
we got a few shots in. ;-)

    And they do it quite well, I might add. Remember, this is a guild that's
just trying things like NToV. We've watched them kill Tormax (and not by
pulling him - they clear to him) with only one warrior in their entire 30-40
person raid crew. That takes balls, to take what for them is one of the
tougher mobs they face and take it down without any real backup to the main
tank. And it's quite clear they develop their own strategies, too.

    James
