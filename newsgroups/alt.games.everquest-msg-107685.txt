My biggest warrior is 24, and he can still solo OK, he is somewhat twinked
though.  I would imagine it would be very tough to do any significant
soloing at 36 with a warrior, lots and lots of downtime in between lt blue
and low dk blue mobs.

For the other classes, it's much easier, undead mobs for the cleric, outdoor
zones for the wizard and druid, lots of places for the shaman.

I still have lots of fun soloing my shaman in a variety of places indoor and
outdoor.
