I tried to use it last night to quit out from under a bad pull... didn't do
a thing for me.  Of course the fact that the only other person in my
group was an SK, who went FD, would explain that: his spell
removes him entirely from the list, so the DA effect putting me
on the "bottom" of the list would have had no effect.

Not that I expected to survive long enough for the quit to take effect,
but they didn't even blink when I hit DA, just kept pounding away
lucklessly... and absolutely correct in their assumption that the
effect would not last and I'd shortly become quite killable once more.
