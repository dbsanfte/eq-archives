I can't comment on its EQ performance, but I played RtCW on one of these and
it kicked ass.  Great framerates at high resolution.  Although keep in mind
the GeForce 4 Go is gimped like the MX so don't plan on getting features
beyond those of a GF 2, of course that is mostly irrelevant because of the
utter lack of games that use GF3/4 features at all.
