does that work?  I'm still unclear on if I've ever gotten this thing to 
work right.

seems more like it.

Ah well, take a look, see what you think.

In particular, on occaisions when my regen rate is inconsequential, I 
swap in the Jymall's Tunic of Frenzy and forgo activating my Fungi 
Covered Great Staff; I could also ditch some of the other regen items 
I'm wearing in favor of something else.

Those occaisions aren't too frequent so far, though, often I'm either 
soloing or MT for a small group, in both cases regen helps a lot, or I'm 
DPS, in which case regen means I'm not an incedental drain on group 
healer mana despite the fact that I frequently get short bursts of aggro 
or am facing DS.

Only when I'm MT for a serious group or when on a raid versus a mob 
where 44 hp a tic means nothing because I'm either not taking damage or 
taking so much that I need real healing, do I skip regen, thus far.

I keep thinking that soon enough things will catch up with me to the 
point where I can't solo and there are no encounters where my regen rate 
makes a difference.  Hasn't happened much so far though.
