<snip commentary>

It's just my .sig. I never  meant to make any political commentary with it.
Notice it's a quote. From someone else on the message board. From one of their
RECENT posts. Why didn't the original quote stir up this rabble? *Shrug* I
thought the quote was funny. Hence, into my .sig it went. No cause for alarm or
attention.
