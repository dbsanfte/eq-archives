Short answer, is random among all those that have 70% or more of the 
points of the person with the most points that wants the item.

Usually, people will also look at who else is interested, and often 
decide, based on that, not to roll against them, if their percieved need 
is greater.

In addition, on rare ocasions, the officers and advocates will also 
decide that a particular drop should be limited to specific classes, or, 
on even rarer occasions, to a specific person.  (I think the latter has 
happened once, maybe twice total).

Our system is certainly far from perfect, but it does reward those that 
attend many raids more than those that don't, while still allowing new 
members to build up points, and be able to compete for drops as well, 
once they have raided enough with us.
