Test hasn't had a pwipe since I've been playing (back before kunark) but
there was an equipment wipe (actually started out as a pwipe and then they
turned it into an equipment wipe. There is a looong story behind that.)
I played on test because it (generally) is a nicer environment, and until
they put the icon on the desktop with the installer, you had to have a
modicum of intelligence just to get into the game. Besides it was fun
running into really weird bugs and features. (remember my monk's hands
switching from roughly 5/38 weaps to 38/5 weaps for a couple of hours one
day.. boy did I get agro...)

(no 'burned wood' incident on test... :)

When my friends all started playing I moved to Morrel Thule to be with them
(they didn't want the 'risk' of playing on test.).

Now they (my friends) are all gone (went to DAoC as it will roxor EQ's
boxors, half of them have since cancelled their accounts due to boredom or
disgust with the devels) but I can't bear to part with my char with more
than twice the levels on MT... and the $50 move function doesn't work to or
from test.
ah well
