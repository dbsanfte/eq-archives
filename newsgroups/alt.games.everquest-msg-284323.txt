The bow and arrow still works as a pulling tool, what my tutor was 
telling me is that I should eliminate it as a "getting aggro off the 
puller" tool.  While it did work for that job, in his opinion going 
straight to an aggro spell was better for the purpose... and he seemed 
to be correct on that.

Look at the cast time of Dooming Darkness compared to Terror of 
Darkness; the key to taking aggro off a puller is to take it quickly, 
and then keep it despite the fact that your slower is likely going to 
try and slow the mob fairly soon, and since the unslowed mob is doing a 
lot more damage than he will be later, your healer is probably going to 
be casting a heal sooner than you'd like.  Yes, you can start any spell 
as soon as you get LOS, but your spell icons won't ungrey until that 
minimum time passes after you've finished your cast.  Since Dooming 
Darkness has a 4 second cast time, that means from the instant you get 
range/LOS, you're 6 seconds away from being able to cast a second spell. 
  Of course during two of those seconds, the mob is moving at snared 
speed, which does have its benefits... or would if the darkness line was 
a better snare or there was a lot of room for the casters to run around in.

I'm not clear on how the terror spells work either, but lacking KEI (and 
frequently lacking any clarity at all) I've experimented with it a 
lot... however it does work, its effect is astonishing; I get far more 
reliable aggro with terror than with any other spell in my arsenal, and 
with a lower cast time.

The other objection to using a Darkness spell to gain aggro is that on 
occaision, I've found that my intial target choice was a bad one; a 
named mob decides to come along for the party, for example, or there's a 
mob in the bunch which is unmezzable, or someone else has DOTed one of 
the adds.  If I've started out by DOTing my initial pick, then that mob 
become essentially unmezzable till its dead, its hard for me to switch 
to a new target.  I do continue to use DOT type spells as situation and 
mana permits, but I avoid them during that first six seconds or so where 
we're potentially going to be changing targets.

Certainly for pulling aggro back off my buddies in mid fight nothing I 
have beats terror, the one second cast time beats everything else in my 
arsenal, but also its high effectiveness compared to other spells.  Yes, 
it does nothing but aggro... what it does though is aggro very nicely. 
Taunt is its only competition, because taunt is instant... but also has 
a high fail rate and a very limited range.

I'm going to start another thread on this question, but the short answer 
is that on Combine, we're missing half the spell lines, so I don't have 
to worry as much as you do about what spells to put in the list.  FD 
always, Lifedraw, always, Terror when grouped, Fear when solo, rest vary 
according to situation (I don't fear kite much, but still find Fear 
useful in splitting or in emergencies when FD has failed)
