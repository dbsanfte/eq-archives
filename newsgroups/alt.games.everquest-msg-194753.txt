They advertised a CARTOGRAPHY system...

Cartography is the art of making maps.
Using the cartography system, you can make maps of the zones you explore.

In answer to the OP's question, they only provide maps of most cities and
newbie areas, not of all zones.
If you don't want to make other zone maps yourself, you need to search the
internet for a site with premade maps for the cartography system.
