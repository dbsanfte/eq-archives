From now on my standard opening remark is going to be "please dont touch,
attack, inspect, sit on, stand on, kick, or even look at the boxes.  If you are
tempted to do so please disband first.  Don't make the rest of us suffer
because of your stupidity".   Clearly, "don't touch" isn't sufficient.
That said, could someone refresh my memory on the spells used to fix these?  I
thought I had read that it requires a combination of spells to cure this crap? 
I don't want to spend *TWELVE* of *MY* hard earned adventure points on spells
that I wouldn't need if people would pay attention to directions, and I SURE
don't want to buy them if they aren't going to work.
