You don't not believe me, you agree with me.

You merely misunderstand.  Snare/Nuke is working, I predicted that
root/DOT would not... and if you follow the subsequent posts
in the thread, you'll see that I was correct, a long time and a full
bar of mana later, I was forced to zone with the Harrier at 70% health.

Not saying that it can't be done, but it sure looked pretty bad to me.
