the worse I have had happen was i was hunting in DL and had been there for
about 5 hours Realtime I had gotten several skill points from leveling in
that time. The zone crashed i lost all my exp the level and the skill points
. Verant says well the zone crashed that was our fault the loss wasnt. I
told the GM well how do you explain the loss he said well you must not have
been saving your game. Go figure i do not recall a save game button anywhere
in EQ =( Of course it said saved every now and then but trust me to really
save it ZONE after you get a level then zone back and continue. It will save
you ALOT of frustration if the zone crashes.
