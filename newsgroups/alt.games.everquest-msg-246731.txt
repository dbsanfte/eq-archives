Now let's see Ryzom is in Beta ... you mean to tell me that games don't
have problems in Beta ... come on.

CoH .. I have already said that all cards are having problems with
logins to CoH and the Mobility Radeon series (for laptops) are having
problems with the game according to their forums.  Are there other
problems?

I can find nothing about problems with L2 Games of Thrones where is
this information?
