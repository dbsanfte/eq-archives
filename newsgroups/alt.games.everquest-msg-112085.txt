I'd like to see more of that for many of the classes.  It's sad that the
default is "go agnostic if you're playing a race that can."  I'd like to at
least see the faction hit for religion lifted or lightened.  Unless your
character is the type who can't hide their religion very well (in which
case, Paladins, SK's, and necros will have class-based faction anyways),
NPC's shouldn't be able to tell your deity just by looking.
