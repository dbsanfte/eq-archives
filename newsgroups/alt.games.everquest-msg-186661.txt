ToV is plain evil for dragging.  The only safe way I know of is an FD drag.
Walk a few steps, FD, then /corpse.  Stand and repeat.  I learned the hard
way that it doesn't matter if you are out of aggro range of the mob the
killed the corpse too.  Got all the way back to the raid and hit the /corpse
key and had a bunch of baddies pop on my head.  Evil evil place.  Good thing
though is that the mobs didn't aggro the raid.
