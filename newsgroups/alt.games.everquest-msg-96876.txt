But each point of Int/Wis over 200 is worth just under 6 mana each,
regardless of level.
So +mana Items are still important once you hit 200 Wis. Don't just blindly
keep pileing on the +Wis, check to see if you can't squeeze a few more mana
by going a different route. 200Wis +20 mana is always gonna be better than
203 Wis... unless you're a Tradeskiller, in which case just ignore this
whole post and go for 250! ;o)
