Yeah, on the other hand, some things that are nice to have in the game can only
be made by tradeskilling, and can only be made by the player that uses them... for
example the Thurgadin Gate Potion.  To make that, one of the components, a velium
vial, trivials at 122 in pottery.  So if you want this gating ability as a class without
any gate at all (melee and hybrid classes), you are stuck learning these skills.
