Ahh, so you started KOS to the Guards, and killed tunnel dwellers
until you are KOS there too? Or vice versa? Either way, you screwed
the pooch, enjoy your puppies. My Iksar can run the tunnels under FP
unmolested. Sit on a rock till the boat comes, and catch it in the
water. Reach BB and jump off before you get to docks. Now run to
destination. I suggest asking politely for a bind somewhere in Gfay.

I do bind melee, and will go out of my way to do it. Why? because they
can't work around it. Porting can be worked around. I will port when
convenient, and if I need to travel, I announce free rides for the
first 5 in a given time period. Cast group port insted of self port,
more downtime, but when travelling, that is usually not an issue. 
I have received many guild invites, gifts and donations after one of
those rides. I glady accept, but do not expect it nor hold it against
you if you don't. You get positive faction for doing it, of course ;)
