Again, though, this will end up breaking the knight classes.  Right now,
that's all we have in a raid, aside from a single HP buff.  Anything else we
can cast, clerics can cast better.  Anything else we can be hit by, warriors
can take the hit better (not by as much as they should be, but that's
something that needs to be fixed, regardless).  Our spell book becomes
rather useless, at least as far as paladins are concerned.  Breaking one
class in the process of improving another isn't going to help the game at
all.
