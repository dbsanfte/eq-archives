-    Eeep, so weight is about capped. That changes things! I'd suggest
moving
-to a Reinforced Acrylia Mantle, a Shimmering Terror Hide Cloak, and
another
-Electrum Black Sapphire earring from the Cougar Claw. That should be
fairly
-weight-neutral and come in under 2 K while upping HPs by nearly 100.
What

better to
-put off the gear upgrade and go for something like a Rallic Pack,
which
-would buy you the weight to be able to move to weapons like an SoS.

At current I am carrying some food/water, a bamboo bo stick, Knuckle
Duster, Greater Lightstone, Sow Potion and some bandages all in a
handmade backpack for the 10% weight reduction, however I am just
waiting on my owlbear pelt so I can make my rallic pack as I already
have the pattern. A question on the rallic pack, I had heard that they
removed the tailloriing skill check when making it? Is this true, or
do you need a certain level in tailloring to make it?

Thanks.

As of last night, I have removed the crafted ring and replaced it with
the Velium Fire, so I am on my way now :) Thanks for all of the
suggestions!
