I finally got all the components today to finish the 2nd part of my hand
wrap quest. Forged fasteners, two young rockhopper claws, and the wraps went
into the sewing kit and A message that said something like "You have changed
something that existed" or something of that nature popped up. So I thought
it had worked... I went to Animalist Poren and handed him the "modified"
wraps and my initiate's cloak and Poof. The handwraps came back but the
cloak went away and he said something about not needing these (the wraps). I
am sure I did the quest correctly, I checked and double checked before
turning everyting in. I've petitioned and wondered if you think they will
help me? What did I do wrong?
Thanks for listening <sob>
