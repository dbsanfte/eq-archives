You forgot a couple.

EQ2: The place to play so long as you meet the strict
         code of the overly anal.
EQ2: Where the name police meet.
EQ2: Play here to feed the grammar Nazi inside you.


Really though it just amazes me how a bunch of folks that play a game 
to just relax can get so uptight over a few words and some creative 
spelling.  But maybe they don't play to relax or to escape from the 
daily grind for a an hour or two.  Maybe this is the best and most 
important part of their lives so anything that does not fit the tiny 
little mold they have for it creates huge stress for them.

I don't know and can oly guess.  But when I see the word dewd or l33t 
in chat I think, "how do they do that? it takes me more time to think 
how to spell things wrong than it would to spell them right."  I must 
confess though, I do abbreviate whenever I can, I just am not that 
fast at typing so I take liberties.
