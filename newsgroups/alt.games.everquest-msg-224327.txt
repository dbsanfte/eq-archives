(Warning!  Swearing and generally senseless ranting.  The near death was my
own fault and I don't normally swear or get so judgemental, but having
someone sit and watch me die so they can get my kills really pisses me the
heck off.)

Dear You:

Yeah, you.  The high elf mage in the robe, the one who's so encumbered you
can't run, but sure can walk right up and stop next to me.  Did you enjoy
watching me almost die in Rathe Mountains today?  One giant I could handle
just fine.  Two usually, but things went wrong, and I thought maybe, gee,
MAYBE, this guy next to me with the mage pet would like one.  I mean, you're
killing them already. You're obvoiusly scouting.  That way he gets an easier
kill since I've nuked this one, and I don't have to gate.

But no.

You wanted ME to do all the work, you fucking little prick.  YOU stood there
and watched me barely get off a gate with two hits' worth of HP to go.  YOU
were so fucking lazy you couldn't sick your fucking mage pet on something
that my corpse wasn't lying under.  That way instead of getting them both
down from 100% or 50%, you can get them both from 33%.  GO YOU!  GO GO
GADGET ASSHOLE!

Did you enjoy your easy kills, you wasted of bandwidth?

And don't tell me you were OOM.  You had your pet, and you don't scout when
you CAN'T KILL SOMETHING.

I hope someone does the same to you someday.  Fuckwit.

 - Me

PS--Thank you to the kind Druid who healed my almost-dead blue butt when I
arrived in PoK.  I owe you one.
