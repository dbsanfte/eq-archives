Well, you've done half your homework =)

While your cite is technically correct, the reality is that the policy 
does not actually restrict the sales of multiple identical items. It 
merely restricts your ability to create pages and pages of auction spam.

Ebay has an approved "multiple listing" auction type specficically to 
allow you to sell as many identical items as you like in a single 
auction.

http://pages.ebay.com/help/sell/multiple.html

/excerpt:
"Online Auction-type listing: 

List identical multiple items together in an online auction. The winning 
bid in a multiple item listing is based on the highest bid per item.

Example:  Suppose you have 50 hammers, all the same, that you'd like to 
sell for at least $5.99 each. You would list them as a quantity of 50, 
and a starting price of $5.99.
