I got the exact same thing trying to connect from work this morning (a bunch
of us come in early Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays to play together).
The others were fine so I just the usual after a patch:

1 - Load Test and try again;
2 - Reboot PC, try EQ and repeat step 1 if that doesn't work;
3 - Go make more coffee and grab another doughnut.

OK, today, it took me 3 doughnuts and 2 cups of coffee (20 minutes) before I
got on, but I eventually did get on...

Hope you finally did as well!

Regards,

OgreLowbie

PS: Come to think of it, I'm not sure I got the same 'error' message about
the forced connection closure...
