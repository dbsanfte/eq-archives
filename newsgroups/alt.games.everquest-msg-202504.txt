Not too sure that this will always pay off - but you can usually find
unwanted loot from the Ice Giant corpses in EverFrost. Those that hunt the
Giants there very often leave the weapons that drop, so as not to become
encumbered. Just be polite and ask if you might take the weapons, I'm sure
that most people won't mind.

Good luck ..

Stevie.
