For the complete list:

You need level 46 to access:
Plane of Tranquility
Plane of Nightmare
Plane of Disease
Plane of Justice

You need level 55 to access:
Crypt of Decay
Plane of Torment
Plane of Valor
Plane of Storms

You need level 62 to access:
Halls of Honor
Bastion of Thunder

You need flags to access all other planes.  The level 55+ planes can be 
accessed at a lower level, if you complete a flag quest/fight for them.

I'm sure if I missed any, someone will point it out.
