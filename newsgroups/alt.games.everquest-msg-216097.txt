Work, yes, work hard, no.  A simple matter of plunking down 1 training point
into each area and then 20 more into the specialty you want, or sitting and
chain casting a cheap spell in that specialty till getting over 50,
depending on which you think is less of a waste of your time.  A shaman that
puts one point into every specialty will indeed almost certainly get
alteration... another approach would be to put one point into the
specialization of your choice, wait till it hits 50, then put one more into
the rest; that would give you a very good chance of getting things the way
you want them without having to spend points or deliberately exercise, but
it would also be throwing away a lot of skill points that go to getting the
rest of the specializations to 50 each, which is of course a 2.5% mana
savings on your "other" fields.
