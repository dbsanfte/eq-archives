Thats the best advice that you can take - do it yourself. If youve
never played a shammy (or any class for that matter) you wont learn it
by being PL'd. Lets say you DO get powerleveled all the way up to 34
and are unleashed to the world to solo. Youll get your ass handed to
you. Sure you're 34, but your skills are still that of a newbie
character. Your defence, melee and mostly your casting skills will
still be very low level. You wont be able to cast any spells at that
level. Everything will fizzle. You'll get frustrated quick. The higher
level you become, the more important your own skill becomes.

Ive PL'd characters (I 2 or 3 box often) on many occasions. I have a
slew of 20's characters that i havent a clue on how to play. You cant
even group, youll piss off everyone in the group because you dont know
how to play the class right and you really cant contribute. If you do
PL, you are kind of stuck being PLd until at least 40s when the PL xp
slows down and the skills catch up. Even then, you still wont know all
the details of HOW to play the character. Dont take the quick and easy
path... it leads to the dark side ;-)
