Maybe I should have been a little clearer,
The reason it was easy to see the other charges by online companies was because I have a Visa card
but I don't use it. Sony online is the only charge on my card. Sony online is the only company with
my card info.

Mistaken billing? Maybe. But twice in 2 billing periods and both times by online companies.......
What would those odds be?????

I am NOT condenming Sony online, just asking people to scrutinize their bills for irregularities
