Been playing around with a shaman on a different server lately.
I'm at a very low level still (13) but its time to start thinking
things thru a bit I guess:

Stat boosts.  Do any of these have much effect at low levels, or
are they really just "ooh its a buff, that must be helping"

Currently I can boost

Dex.  Proc rates (not many people at this level have proccing
weapons, I sure don't) and maybe skill ups?
Agility.  A tiny bit of AC and nothing else?
Strength.  More damage per hit?  Not a lot more, but perhaps it
adds up
Stamina.  HP boost, mostly.  See HP buff below.  At least this
one stacks on top of everyone else's HP totals

AC boost.  Damage mitigation.  But AC in small increments rarely
has much effect at all, as a cleric at 65 I'm pretty convinced AC
boosts are useless 99% of the time and "mostly useless" the rest
of the time.  Plus this one costs a component!

HP Boost.  This is good, sadly at my level Inner Fire is good for
10 or 15 hp worth of boost.  5% of my pathetic HP total, maybe
half of that of an actual tank or half decent twink (was grouped
with a 10 shaman with 1300 hp earlier today... so 1%!)  Sadly it
doesn't stack with cleric/druid buffs, but on the bright side,
its the most mana efficient heal I've got or will have till
somewhere around 20.

Resist Buffs.  Another set of pretty useless buffs, at low levels
the amount resists are boosted by are low, and the number of
caster mobs you are facing also tend to be low.  If you -know-
you are up against a specific spell line and are getting some
resists, then raising the resist stat can be worthwhile, but in
my experience, most of the time you don't resist anything at all,
or else you are already resisting pretty much everything.  Odds
of a lowbie shaman resist buff making a difference are low.

Nukes.  These are painfully tiny so far, useful for pulling and
getting evocation up but thats about it.

DoTs.  These seem to be effective.  Irritatingly, though, they
have a DD component which can break root.  After cleric DOTs
(undead only and not all that good, but real DoTs) and druid DoTs
(real McCoy) this is annoying.  Worse, shaman dont get snare, so
while a root breaking on a druid isn't such a big deal, its much
worse for a shaman.  Tainted Breath says it does 10 damage DD and
8 per tic... for that extra 2 points of damage we have to put up
with breaking root?

SOW.  Sure can't complain about SOW.  Mainstay for every class
until mid 50s when Run 3 finally does away with the need... and
actually beats it for utility.

Gate.  Cuts half the distance off a round trip home.  Useful on
rare occaision as an escape, too.

Heals.  At my level, Light Heal, which is pretty much the same as
a cleric heal... that will change at 14.  I won't get the next
one till 19, so for the next several levels I'll be dropping well
behind the healer curve I suppose.  Looks like that race goes on
like that all the way up the ladder.

Slow.  I mock the slow.. but its listed at 11% at level 5 plus 1%
every 4 levels, which means at 9 its good for 12%, at 13 for
13%.  Anyway, even if it was only 10% slow, thats 10% less damage
over the duration of the spell.  For 20 mana I can't even cast
light heal once, which would be 30 hp.  So if the mob is going to
do at least 300 damage over the duration of the spell, this is a
better buy.  So question is, how long is that mob going to live
and how much hitting is it going to be doing?  Sadly, the higher
level mobs (where I'd really get my mana's worth) tend to resist
more, blowing more mana if it sticks at all.  As another note, if
I'm soloing this looks even better, because a longer gap between
mob blows means a better chance of getting my other spells off.

At 14 I'll get the next slow which will start at 23% (almost
doubling amount of slow... for three times the cost!).  Now the
mob has to do 450 damage over the duration of the spell (or its
life span, since dying tends to end the spell early) to get my
mana's worth.

Root.  Not till 14.  And DOTs break it, an unpleasant surprise
since I figured to rely on root/rot a lot.  Still, in general
can't complain much about root, particularly having played a mage
and a bard.  Oh, and it looks like its a no damage root, which
sure beats the crappy druid line that can break mez.

Canabalize.  Not till 24, thats a loooong ways off. Something to
look forward to I suppose

Regen.  At  24, which is also a long ways off, but not nearly so
far as the druid regen was.

Befriend Animals.  At 29... but wow, why don't I ever see shamen
using this one?  Charmed mobs as pets just rock, or used to
before the nerf.  Trust me to start a class after a great exp
generator gets shrunk down to size!

Haste.  Not till 29, and vastly inferior to chanter haste at that
level.  Still, without chanter handy, for 80 mana for 5+ minutes
of 30% more DPS from a melee, this has got to be a good deal most
of the time.

Invisibility.  Not till 29.  Man, thats unbelievable, 29 levels?
Could be worse, a cleric gets it never... but wow, not even a
self only version till here.

Pet.  Not till 34.  And I thought 9 levels for a beastlord was a
long time to wait!  Still, unlike clerics and druids, this pet
seems to be effective from 34 on.  Cleric pets are effective for
4 or 5 levels, druid pets seem to be effective never (well, for
farming perhaps), while dog-dog seems to be more utilized than a
shadowknight's pet, or even a chanter's pet. Hmm, scanning
further down the list, it seems you get a new pet every spell
level from here on, so this is less mysterious than it seems.

That looks like about it till high levels.

So whats the operational model for the low level shaman?
Slow/heal/tank, and try to make it to pet level?
