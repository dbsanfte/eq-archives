In some respects it is on par with Voodoo3, and I'd lean to putting it
there and my V3 ran just just fine.

It is however slow, and if you havent tweaked the system to make sure you
are running well (as I did with my old Celeron 300 system) it will
bottleneck and you will be limited on the clip plane you can use.

So the original poster would do well to grab a quick upgrade, Geforce 2
would be handy and cheap - and is of a level that wont outperform the rest
of the system too much (assuming the rest of the system is of the same era
as the video card.

SWG and EQ2 would I lay odds not be a good idea on the system - at least
you would need to get a Geforce 4 of some kind - and a system that wont
bottleneck on it.
