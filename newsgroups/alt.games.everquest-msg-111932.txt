 Yeah but have you ever had people get right up in your face while you was
in a group asking for a sow or buff and not wanna move? I've had this happen
pretty often. I to love helping others that appreciate it but the rude one's
tend to leave a bad empression on you. Sense I do have a druid I can see it
from both sides so all I can say is when you ask for it do it nicely and
thank them for what you get. If your declined for any reason thank them
anyway cause the odds are there in the middle of something or if not you'll
make them feel like crap for not giving it to ya. lol
