You can play on your father's system if he has the game installed. I don't suggest taking your disc
with you and installing it there, they may track that kind of thing. 
As for running on a computer, that's easy also. Back up your files and put the HD with EQ
on it in the new system, reinstall and copy backuped files to the HD. Should be golden then.
