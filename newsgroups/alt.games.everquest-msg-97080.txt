Hehe, yep. GMs dont always follow the rules we others have to follow.
Good example are race names. Players cant use race names in a last name 
(or so im convinced after 8 different names with "troll" in them, then 
trying some 10 random letter conbination followed by troll and still be 
rejected), and then seing GMs with race names in the last name (Former 
Veeshan now Stormhammer's Wildjan the Magic Troll spring to mind).
