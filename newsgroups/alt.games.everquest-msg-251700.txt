Tried all three directions getting in the zone? Did you try using the
translocator in East Freeport, to Ocean of Tears and the translocator
from there to BBm?

I gather the book from PoK and Greater Faydark are having the same
results.

Not sure if the boats from Fironia Vie are working, but that is
another choice if they are functional. Do not know if there are
translocators from that direction.
