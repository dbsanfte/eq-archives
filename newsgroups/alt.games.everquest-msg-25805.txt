    The thing is, some pieces have NICE spells attached. Look at the druid
set - Snare on the gloves for group situations, and a DoT on the arms for
soloing. Both are nice spells to have, and both are in slots where the druid
isn't giving up much else to wear them. Even stuff like the SHM armour is
good for flipping buffs on non-tanks, since the group stat buffs are usually
weaker than the single-target buffs. Clerics have one piece that could be
considered good - the gauntlets - in a group environment, and one piece that
USED to be good - the BP. Legs and BP are nice for the stats, but the actual
spells on them stink.

    I noticed FoH's officer paladin is up to 1400 AC unbuffed now.
