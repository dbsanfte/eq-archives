I'm a big fan of the first-person view.  The reason is simple.
It makes me feel like I'm there.  It's more immersive.  It makes
me feel like I'm the character.  I see what the character sees.
I'm not some floating magic glob of ooze controlling someone
below me.

The third-person view makes me feel like I'm playing a game by
controlling a character.  Less immersion.  A third-person view
FEELS like a game.  A first-person view feels like I've entered
an alternate reality.  Some people may prefer the game feel.  I
prefer the "I'm really there in that alternate reality" feel.

I'm not a fan of multiple party members either.  It makes me feel
like I'm playing a game, rather than actually being there and
being that person.  Having just yourself makes you the hero.
Having a whole party makes you, well, a manager, I guess.  I'd
rather be a hero than a manager, at least when I'm escaping into
my alternate realities!  :)

Different folks, different strokes.
