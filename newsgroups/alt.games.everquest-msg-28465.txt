Eh, learn to run, learn to use the firepots, learn to hate Velious, and
you'll be fine.  It's been a long time since I got a port other than at the
end of a group or raid, and I've been doing ok.

The perfect class.  :)

Clerics or chanters may get free ports, but no one thinks twice about
squeezing a rogue.  But guess who gets that tell when they die at the
bottom of Sebilis?  Their corpse is rotting, and you're reminding them of
that time they made you run to the bank to pay for a port... Ahh, that's
what makes life worth living!
