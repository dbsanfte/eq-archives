Funny boy. Ever looked at the high end cultural smithing stuff for
druids/wizards ? The best the druids can wear is imbued enchanted chainmail,
which while VERY nice looking is mid level gear at best. On the other hand
HE Int casters that worship Tunare can wear the Imbued Enchanted Art Keeper
armor which is VERY nice.

Yeah... druids get everyhting handed to them on a silver platter....
