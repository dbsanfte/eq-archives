I'd like to find how many different resist debuffs
(specifically, magic resist) can be stacked onto a single
mob.

The reason is that for convenience I'm trying to get my
Paladin the Worker Sledgemallet from the Overthere quest,
so that he always has a component-free method of Gating
out of somewhere.  The problem, of course, is that he's
incredibly KoS in the Overthere and the quest mob has to
be Amiable in order to get the quest to work.  The only
shortcut method of doing so is to have the Paladin Charm
the mob himself.  (Having another PC charm the mob raises
faction only to Indifferent, not high enough.)

The good news:  After a few months (literally) of shopping
the Bazaar, I have finally acquired the rare Puppet Strings,
which allows any class to cast a Charm.  The bad news:  The
item only has 2 charges left, and the quest mob has a rather
strong Magic Resist.  I'd rather not have my only 2 charges
get resisted immediately or wear off too quickly to do the
turn-in.  I only have 2 chances, so I need to maximize their
odds of working.

So...  How does one go about piling the maximum amount of
MR debuff onto a mob?  Which uber MR debuffs stack with each other?
I can bring along any classes I need for the mass-debuff effort.

And yes, I've already gotten the other charm-related factors
taken care of (my Paladin is level 65, and I'm going to boost
his CHA as far as possible before the attempt.)
