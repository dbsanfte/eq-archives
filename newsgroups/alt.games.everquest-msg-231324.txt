"Myself"?

My EQ accounts (and I'd have a dozen to move the plat through) would be 
supported with gamecards.

The paypal coming in when I sell plat for cash? Sure... but that money 
is clean.

And the paypal going out when I buy the plat? Why wouldn't I pay cash? 
Name me a plat seller who would refuse 1,000 cash via a courier? And 
assuming the underworld market were to exist... count on one hand how 
many seconds it would take for fences who 'gladly accept anonymous cash 
for pp' to spring into being.

Once its in pp form, tracking it is impossible, moving into and out of 
guild banks, networks of gamecard users, etc etc etc would make it 
virtually impossible to prove who paid who what, and totally legal 
because plat has no value per the terms of use to play eq, because soe 
owns all of it all the time. Hell... all you really have to do is get 
the pp into the game... when its time to sell it, you just do. If in the 
meantime, if anyone asked you where you got your 50,000,000 pp you could 
say someone's guild gave it to me, or you got a lucky raid drop. You 
don't have to keep records, it has no value, you aren't obligated to 
report your sources of plat, or even keep track of it....

Meanwhile, it may have lost cash value over time.

Maybe, maybe not... in the current crop of mmrpgs yeah that is a big 
risk... but in the future with subscription rates the size of small 
countries...and more realistic economomies...

The risk of SOE deleting it isn't much different from having your 
'normal' assets frozen. New version of an age old problem for launderers.

That assumption is naive. The criminal element always adapts faster than 
the law enforcement element.
