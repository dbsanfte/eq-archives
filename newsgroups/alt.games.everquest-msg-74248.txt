I SO feel your pain.  I was SHOPPING for the love of God last week, at lvl
27...that communist potlicker came through the damn wall and killed me in
5(I think, it went terribly fast) hits.  Couldn't even get a spell off
(still makes my blood boil)...all I wanted was to browse, and died right in
the damn store.  Needless to say at the first opportunity, I will give
Kizdean Gix a Columbian necktie.
