I can't speak for the Northern Wolf Armor, but my enchanter ran the quest
for the casters slippers in Neriak when the quest went live, at around 33rd,
and wore them till about 48th when I managed to get an upgrade )(Golden
Efreeti boots... nice upgrade, long camp.).

Some of the bits of the quest armors are surprisingly good. Some of them
might as well be cloth.
