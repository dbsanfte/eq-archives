Hi:

Simple question really: I want to create my own guild, and I have several
names that I like, but I'd like to know if there is a site on the Web that
will allow me to see whether or not any of the names I have in mind have
already been taken? Guild Magic springs to mind, but not every guild is
listed there. Any input would be great.

Also, I've been told that instructions for creating a new guild can be found
at EQLive.com, but search as I might, I can't find any information on the
subject. Again, any pointer would be very helpful indeed.

Many thanks to any replies in advance,

Stevie.
