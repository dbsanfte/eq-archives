No. They aren't. But you do have to make an extra effort.

I play on Morrel thule with my brother (who lives halfway accross the 
country), and we manage to duo dungeons just fine.

In our teens we took the first two levels of befallen. Later we rolled 
through the warrens, taking the Prince, and later the King, obtained the 
BP off Mugglewump in our mid twenties, even took the batlings and Krode 
the Diviner. We worked our way to the Big Mushroom in PC in our early 
twenties. We quested ghoulbane through the mid to late and several 
pieces of lambent armour for my bard (in the depths of SolA, and just 
recently the Jail in Mistmoore. We cracked the giant fort in FM and 
rolled through it (not just the entrance) (not a dungeon per se but 
still fun).

We dropped Grimfeather the other day while camping another couple 
lambent stones. A couple weeks ago we rolled through Nagena to try our 
hand at her. (Actually got all the keys etc, and got to her room, but 
didn't manage to spawn her) We're off to lower guk next.

And we haven't twinked these guys in the least, haven't even bought 
anything from the bazaar, just for fun.

My point is dungeon crawling is still *possible*, all you need is at 
least one other like minded individual who you can group with regularly.

But yeah I feel your pain. We rarely group with others... simply because 
they're is almost never anybody where we are, or who are interested in 
doing a dungeon crawl.
