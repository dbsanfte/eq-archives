The only experience I ever had with Dell is when a salesman hung up on me
because I couldn't tell him if I was going to use the computer for personal
or business use.  I wanted to ask a question about the system, but I
couldn't ask the question until they figured out what I was going to use it
for so they could route me to the correct department.  Since I was using it
for BOTH personal and business I kinda freaked them out and after 3 phone
calls and being transferred back and forth I got a little testy and the
salesman hung up on me.  Needless to say I didn't buy a Dell.
