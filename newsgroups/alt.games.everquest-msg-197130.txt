I died in North Karana not that long ago and I spent an hour and a
half searching for my body, and it's not a big zone. I even went
east-west from one end to the other and still couldn't locate it. Of
course it rained just about the whole time which makes it even harder
(why does it have to rain %50 of the time in this game ?)
