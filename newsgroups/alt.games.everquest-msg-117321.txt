Not sure inheritance would be a good way to go for something like
this. The resource requirements would be pretty high if every single
Rusty Dagger (for example) were a unique item instead of just a
pointer to a database.

I doubt it, or if it does, certainly not as well as it might. I have
no proof, but just look at the weird bugs that have occurred
throughout the history of the game - many of them indicate extreme
spaghetti code, not decent OOP.

The one that boggles my mind was picking up dropped coins. You could
pick up dropped junk all day long with no problem, but if you picked
up a stack of dropped coins, then picked up another stack right away,
sometimes this would make you go LD.

What kind of OOP coding would allow that?

Even more bizarre was the solution Verant applied. Instead of fixing
the bug, they made it so you simply can't drop coins any more. Wrong
problem solved.
