 I'd say no. Someone mentioned the north named being KoS but I was under
the impression that all North ToV mobs were kos to everyone since they
weren't on CoV faction. However, never having good CoV faction until
recently, I can't verify that. If that is the case, you can probably
wander there a few days after patch day. If it's not, you'll need 30+
people. More or less depending on equipment and experience level. Most
of the mobs are standard ToV mobs but the flurry drakes are a bit tough
if you're not prepared.

 Not able to answer these questions. I was there twice when I accidently
clicked the house and it sucked. Since I wasn't sure on the tree to
click it took me 30 minutes running all over with mobs beating on me to
finally find the right one. Just that itself was enough to make me never
want to go back to PoM again. Apparently Verant likes leaving that a
broken zone. Due to that and the trouble to get there, you usually wont
find many people there.
