Well, I dunno about 'flaming' but... when do you 
'desperately' need a sow or a clarity?  I've had so many 
people tell me they want a sow for a corpse run - if one 
of my characters doesn't have sow, I run without it.  If 
it's a long run, I *might* shout out an offer to *pay* 
for the SoW (always keep a bit of cash, a spare weapon, 
food/drink, and a light-source in the bank) but if I 
don't get it, I start running.  As for clarity - c'mon, 
I don't even *play* a chanter capable of giving out 
breeze/clarity (okay, she's level *one*.  hasn't even 
killed anything yet.  can you blame me, when I tell you 
I'm an erudite chanter?) and I can't believe the amount 
of people screaming for clarity.  And in the most 
assuming ways, too.  "Clarity at orc 1 plz!"  Uh... no?  
I mean, once in awhile I'll hand out free 
sows/binds/buffs at the gate if I'm playing my shaman, 
but if *I* want a certain advantage, I'll play the 
character that *gets* that advantage, or I'll offer some 
kind of payback for the time/mana/HP involved.
