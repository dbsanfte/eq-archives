Adding the number modifier changed it.    You can prove this yourself.  I did
the test on E'ci the other day.   /who all count returned around 1950.  /who
all count 1 60 returned 1455.

The fact that you specified a number must be returned meant that it could no
longer include anons and roleplays.

/who all count druild will likewise give a different result than /who all
count druild 1 60.

The difference is that the first is counting anons and roleplays, just as they
said it would.
