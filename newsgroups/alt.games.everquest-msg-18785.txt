   Being a Wizard, I don't know

    I don't think so, I seem to get my normal attacks (on the rare
occassions that I melee) even though casting.
    Though at early levels in my life, it appeared as though melee swings
did interrupt my spells.  But, that was about a million patches ago, and it
was before I knew that moving before you even begin to think about starting
to cast could interrupt you... so it's possible that that was just in my
head.

> Is there a way to do an "auto-bash" type of control?

    Only if you're an NPC, and know that you're fighting a caster, in which
case bash automatically kicks in as soon as I begin casting.

    Dodge is a passive skill.  Though it only goes up when you're being
attacked by Blue to you MOBs or higher (though it might actually be exp
granting greens too).  Though it seemed to me that my dodge skill only went
up as I was being slain by red to me mobs with an auto-bash skill... 75
corpse runs later my dodge skill is finally maxed.
