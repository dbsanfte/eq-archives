I'm seeing the opposite problem. If I hit alt+enter in window mode, my
monitor switched to full screen and then minimised EQ.

After a bit of digging it seems that my desktop resolution has to be the
same as EQ's resolution now. I was running a 1024 desktop and 1152 EQ,
all fine. Now, I have to up my desktop resolution to 1152 to play in
fullscreen.
