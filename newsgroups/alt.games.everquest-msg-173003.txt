I assumed they continued at the same rate the lower lv ones did is how I
arrived at my formulas.  So going from silver diamond to silver blue
diamond should be the same as going from plat (or velium) diamond to
plat blue diamond.

I've got a calulator in excel format that tells you how much you are
spending to make an item based on trivial and your skill (assuming 110+
Cha buy from merchant) that I made, have to upload that to my web site
some day.  It used to be on my guild's web site, but I don't even know
if that still exists :/
