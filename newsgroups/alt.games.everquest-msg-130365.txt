Actually, you brought it into question, not me.  Nothing
you quote addresses the two points you said were in the
article and which are not in the article.  No matter
how much you fume, the bottom line is that you misrepresented
what was in the article.  That was my point, and remains
my point.  My statement was true, and remains true.

Perhaps if you were truthful in your attribution you would
be more convincing.
