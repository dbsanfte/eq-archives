I've found chanters to be much desired in LDoN as well. Defensive CC is
a huge plus in LDoN - the puller can just pull 3 or 4, chanter parks
them, group mows them down and when the group is working on the last one
the puller goes and grabs the next batch.

Healing a group with no defensive CC can be a problem. Usually I drop an
elixir on everybody being beaten on since if I use my fast heals I'll
automatically get aggro from every MOB not being actively tanked.

The availability of haste and reduction in pulling downtime compensates
for the reduction in DPS - haste increases available DPS, and the parking
of MOBs means the DPS is being constantly applied. Plus the reduction in
need for healing means that the main healer can add some DPS as well,
and makes wipes less likely.
