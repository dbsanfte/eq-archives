Easy test for anybody who has to see it themselves:  Compare the
AA xp gained by a L62 and a L65 in the same group (both chars at
100% AA) while fighting mobs that are within 5 of 62 but not 65.
PoStorms trash mobs, for instance, are easily accessible and
usually plentiful.  The 62's AA bar will progress noticeably
faster despite the fact that the mobs are dark blue to both.
