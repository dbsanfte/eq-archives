Don't be too sure. Some people out their have so much money and loot 500pp
is nothing to them.

Best donations I've had are : cone of Mystics, Black sapphire (both these
people dont carry around money) and one guy gave me 400pp .. which I split
to my guildies who alerted me to this geeza.

Worst : 6 coppers (Whats the point in that!!!) and ofcourse free ports,
which I don't mind doing if they ask nicely :)
