Yep.  With each expansion there are more textures added.  I do not know what
the amount of memory the textures are at now but with all expansions through
Luclin installed the amount of textures for Armor, race animations and spell
affects was around 650 megabytes.  With POK, LOY and now LDoN who knows what
the total is at.  I convinced several members of my former guild to upgrade
to 1 gig of memory after I upgraded and they saw a vast improvement in the
game.

I read a post a while back from one of the programmers for EQ.  Unlike many
other games, EQ loads all of the needed textures and animations when the
game starts up.  That is why you can turn off models incase your system is
lacking sufficient memory to run the game to its max.  He said the game does
this so that if you were walking through a zone a suddenly met someone the
game would not have to pause and load that texture or model.  That would be
some serious lag hell.

With all expansions loaded, my system, P4 2.2 gig, windows XP pro, 1 gig
memory and geforce4 TI 4200 with 128 megs only lagged when a major RAID was
taking place like when we took down the Dragon in POI.
