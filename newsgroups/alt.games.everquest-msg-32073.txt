Well, I found a decent spot for xp, and that's parked right there at the 
druid ring in Butcherblock. 4 static spawns, level 5-8, with three more a 
short run away and 1 more an even shorter run away. The fact that they 
are skellies and drop bones is all bonus. Occasional cloth armor sells to 
the druid vendor right there for 1 or 2 gold. Getting food and water is 
as easy as asking the druids porting in if they'd care to sell a foraged 
stack or two.
So now I've gone from level 6 to level 9 in no time flat, and the 
skellies will be getting green for me. Someone in my guild mentioned the 
Warrens, and since I've never been there, I'm considering it. Will a 
gnome necromancer be kos in Painell (another zone I've never visited, 
bonus) and if so, is there a quest/mob I can do to make me not kos? Necro 
guild there would make spells and buying/selling easier, and if I can 
bank, I think I'm set.

Again, thanks in advance for answers.
