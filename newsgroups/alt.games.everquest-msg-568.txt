 I just received a fantastic weapon!  Unfortunately, it's not usable by my
Druid.

I've been trying to auction it, but it's difficult because it sells for
18,600 on average (according to eqprices.com.)

I'd be happy to sell it for 15,000 but haven't found a buyer.

Here's the question!  Is its acceptable to advertise specific items on this
news group rather than spend 18 hours clicking the auction button in East
Commons!  I'm not interested in selling it for cash... only platinum.

I also have a character on another server who's a master jeweler, would it
be acceptable to offer his services in this news group.

Is there anything official in the newsgroup charter?  If not, is there a
general consensus, or etiquette?
