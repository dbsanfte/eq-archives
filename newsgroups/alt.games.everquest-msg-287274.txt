Well, at least it appears that the hides required are the same for
multiple spells around the same level. The only problem I have with it
is that the hides you need for a particular spell seem to drop from
higher level zones than the spell they're used to create.

At least the bank commodities we're dealing with now are much fewer in
number and drop more reliably.
