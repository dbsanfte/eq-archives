Most likely, one of the named was up, and you didn't know what to pull.  It
hasto do with how the Trak's Teeth zone works.   Froglok Hunters and Foragers
are two separate chains.   Each time a froglok forager is killed, a new one
will spawn.  Almost always, there will only be one up at a time.  Every so
often, instead of another forager your chain will pop a named monster instead.
Each chain has it's own set of named monsters with thier own drops.  (and some
of them are pretty nice).   When the named monster is killed, another forager
will immediately pop, or another named.
