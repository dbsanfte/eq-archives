I'm running fine with everything turned on and the following
two systems:

1.  400MhZ Celeron, 384MB, ATI something-or-other (an older
       card, I got it when Kunark came out).

2.  500MhZ Celeron, 512MB, crappy Intel 810 graphics chipset.

I have to turn down the clipping plane in the center of the most
cluttered cities (Catville, Shadow Haven), but other than that
they're doing well.

I like them a lot, but most of the improvement can only be
seen if you really get up next to someone and watch their
face from close up.

One way to find out -- turn 'em all on and see how your system
runs.  :-)  You can always turn things down if it starts chugging.

But I'm having absolutely no problem with 512MB, and only slightly
higher zone/load times with 384MB.
