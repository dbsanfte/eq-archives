He's not telling you how to play, he's telling you how SoE wants you to 
play the game.  Time and time again, they have said it is meant to be a 
social game where people group, and they highly encourage that.  If you 
don't want to play it the way they intend you to play it, then, you will 
suffer from the limitations placed on you by your decision.  If you find 
that you need to constantly med up between pulls in a group situation, 
then you are doing something wrong.  I managed somehow to level up well 
past the minimum level for KEI prior to KEI being introduced without 
having to do so.

If you are looking for a nonstop constant action game, then EQ is not 
what you are looking for, that is not what the game is intended to be, if 
you don't like that fact, then you should find a game that better suits 
your playstyle.
