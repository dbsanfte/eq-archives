The patch before last the did something that was allowing
things like sow and wolf form to coexist.  When they changed
it in the last patch now none of them overwrite.  Treeform
used to work if you had sow or wolf form on, as of last
patch, it does not, probably what ever they did to fix the
previous code error, broke a different spot of the code. 
Chances are they will say it was never intended to be that
way, in the first place.
