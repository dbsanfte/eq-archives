I've raided Chardok royals many many times now, including pulling and
leading raids down there..

Nice research, however a few of your facts are incorrect.

Im going home in 10 mins though so can't answer in-depth just yet.... look
for another reply in an hour or so.. and remember the magic phrase - It
ain't chardok if you don't have to summon every single corpse at least once
during the raid!
