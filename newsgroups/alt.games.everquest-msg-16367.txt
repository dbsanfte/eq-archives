I would like to start a thread on what good ways are for lower levels =
(up to 15 or so) to get some cash. I will try to compose the responses =
and put them on a website somewhere. If you put some suggestions also =
note at what levelrange it is optimum and good zones to do/find it in.

Some examples:

Silk Swatches
lvl 10-15.=20
Just outside antonica newbie zones (EC, WC, WK).=20
Buy a small sewing kit. Hunt large and giant spiders and convert the =
Spider Silks to Silk Swatches (stackable). The converts will always =
succeed. Mind that you use SpideR silks, not SpiderLING silks.
Depending on the server they will go for 1-2pp a piece and stacks are =
often sold per 25-30pp and on rich servers up to 45pp. This because mid =
to higher level tailoring needs these silks for many items.

Bone Chips
lvl 1-5.
Most newbie areas (NQ, EC, GF, ButB, NF).
Hunt the decaying skeletons and collect their Bone Chips (stackable). =
Necro characters need these chips to summon their pets, so sell them to =
players.=20
Usually 2pp per stack. Might get lucky and get up to 4pp

Greater Light Stones
lvl 10-15
The wisps who drop them can be found in a lot of zones. Erud's Crossing =
and WC are known to have many around.
You need a magic weapon for this. Hunt will-o-wisp's. They drop =
lightstones of 3 varieties: Burned-out (worthless, can't be sold), =
normal (worth around 8gp to 1pp) and, the main price, the Greater =
Lightstones.=20
There are rumours that the greater lightstones are destroyed if damage =
spells are cast on the will-o, but this I don't know for sure.
The greater only sell for 2 to 3pp at stores, but can often be sold to =
other players for 7-8pp. This is because of a quest in NK which will =
yield exp and an item worth 9pp.


I'm sure you guys can come up with a lot more. But please only feasable =
for "normal" characters. Not a cha-maxed lvl 1 HIE enchanter and Baking. =
Although the skill might be profitable even for normal players so I =
might include it anyway :) Another good one would be the Gnoll Fangs =
from BB but I don't know the specifics for that quest right now.
