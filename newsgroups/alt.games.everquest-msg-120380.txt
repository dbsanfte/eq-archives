I find regular charm better for solo'ing than dire charm.  With a dire
charmed critter, he will get damaged and someone will have to heal it.
Or you have to wait for a long time for it to regen back.  They don't
get the speedy regen of animations or mage pets.

The true "charm" of charm solo'ing is that 2 critters are beating the
crap out of each other, and when they're both down to a sliver of
health, you kill them both for full XP.
