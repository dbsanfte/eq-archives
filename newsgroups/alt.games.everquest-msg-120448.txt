No.  Draught spells are anything but long casting.  Their mana usage is
good, but not amazing.  It's the speed of these spells that makes them nice.

The problem with boosting a wizard's power in a group is that most spells
that would allow this will also boost that wizard's power to solo.  I play a
wizard almost exclusively, and they can solo like a champion.  Granted, the
down time is a pain, but there are no perfect classes in Everquest.  You
just have to find the one whose strengths and weaknesses most closely match
what you want.  Down time and a glass jaw are the most noteworthy weaknesses
of a wizard, although the glass jaw part is pretty much common to all pure
int casters.  I like these weaknesses, as they keep my class a relative
novelty in Norrath.

What it appears hughes is talking about is something that casts so slowly as
to be useless for soloing, but which is mana efficient enough that a wizard
can get into a steady pull group more easily.  This idea might overpower the
class, but it might not.  I'd love to see it on test, even as a replacement
to one of our other spell lines.  Take the Al Kabor spells out and give us
this instead . . . just on test, to see how it works.
