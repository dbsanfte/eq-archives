Hello folks.

Sorry to bother you with this, but I wondered if any of you brainy types
might be able to suggest a solution to my problem.

About a year ago I moved house and was forced to give up my ISDN connection
and go back to a 56k modem.  Now this was a particularly bad 56k modem with
an average transfer speed of about 1-2kps and regular pauses of about two
minutes at a time during transfers.  EQ was obviously out of the question.

For the last three weeks I've been waiting for BT to provide me with ADSL,
with one of my main ambitions being to get back to Norrath.

Finally they switch it on (two weeks overdue), we sort out the problem of
the altered username they hadn't told me about, and so on, and I suddenly
realise the internet IS worth using after all.  So far so hoopy.

But on installing EQ I've discovered that I can't even get as far as the
game proper since it invariably locks up on the character creation screen.
Sometimes it doesn't get past the logon screen.

Primarily it's character creation, though.  I've tried a few times to
re-create the character I used to play (yes I know I'll have to start at
level 1 again!) but to no avail.  I select race, sex and "occupation", type
a name, edit the stats, then go to adjusting appearance.  "Face" works fine,
but cycling through "hair" or "eyes" results in a lockup.  The mouse cursor
sometimes jams and sometimes doesn't, but always the game hangs and I notice
my hard drive LED flashes (very faint) every couple of seconds or so.

Has anyone got any ideas?  Is this a known bug?  Or is it just yet another
problem unique to my dysfunctional machine?

I suppose it's worth mentioning that it's an AMD Athlon 900Mhz with 256Mb
RAM, a GeForce 2 MX video card and a SoundBlaster Live 5.1.  I've installed
DX8.1 and the video and sound drivers are up-to-date as far as I can tell.
I have disabled Norton Internet Security and uninstalled ZoneAlarm which I'd
tried out as an alternative to NIS's continual pop-up warnings but which
jammed my modem completely...

Gods, what a load of rubbish.  Can any of you make any sense of it?

S.
