Interestingly I've been quadding in Cobalt Scar as a druid since level
44, and prior to that Iceclad and Eastern wastes from about level 36.

While in CS one of my guild friends, a wizard, came to 'PL' me. He'd
AE snare, nuke a little, then gate to let me finish them.

Wizard AE snare seems to last roughly 2 seconds after gating. Frankly, as
a druid, I'd sometimes have 5 wyverns at once with no problems, as thats
how many aggro from the tower. I dread to think how well I'd fare without
sow and a nice long lasting snare, especially given the 'snare broke
time to warp back to spawn' nature of Cobalt Scar.

You can keep telling people 'druids cant quad, I dont count it as quadding,
till 58' if you like, but a million druids across the servers , who have
been castigated since release for being overpowered because they quad
too much, will be laughing at you. Ironically, its only once you start
getting to the higher level post-kunark levels that quadding and soloing
stop becoming the best way to play and even if that were not the case
I've yet to meet a 60 druid who uses AE snare.
