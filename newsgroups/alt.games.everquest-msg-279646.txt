That's why my Loot hotkey uses "/tar a_", which avoids those names;
the underscore is treated as a space in the name.  The key actually
includes both "/tar a_" and "/tar an_"; one of them targets the
corpse, the other just gives me a message about no such name being
around.  Of course, sometimes the first one targets the corpse and
the second retargets to a mob somewhere nearby.  (Each /target command
targets the nearest matching mob/corpse/PC, up to I think 50 feet.)

Yes, that works great if your group includes a pet class.  I used the
assist-a-pet a lot when running with a BST friend.  What's really nice
about targetting the corpse through a pet, is that you can do it while
sitting and medding.  Then you can /con the corpse, and if it says it's
decaying in 30 seconds or less, it means there's no loot on it, so you
don't have to interrupt your medding to go loot it. :-)

Hm, I'll have to try this.
