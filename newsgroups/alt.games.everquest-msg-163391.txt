Hmm, an interesting experiment occurs to me then.  Unencumbered, do some time
trials running a set distance across an area near a bank.  Now encumber
yourself to drop your agility, and time it again.  Now get an agi buff that
takes you back to your  starting agility, and run it one more set.

If its a drop in agility that slows you down, this should cure it.  If not...
well, not.
