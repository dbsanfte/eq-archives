Especially true if you don't use the /pause X,/doability.
The default doability( line 1) doability (line 2) is too slow. default 100 ?
500 ?
Depending on lag and who knows what else I can often get the time between 5
to 15 which is often faster than I could manually do it.

Don't mix Taunt non-taunt abilities. IE don't try evade, beg PP BS on a
hotkey.

But regardless how you set it up pay attention. If hotkeys are working
faster than you NP. If not don't..
