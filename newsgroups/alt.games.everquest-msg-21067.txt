I thought this was covered by the latest patch message, but I don't see it.
But the question was asked on EQ's board.  Here's the answer (it should be
noted that this is the same answer they've been giving for well over 2 years
now):

Well, actually, there are plenty of trade skills that folks make a profit
from. There just aren't any that people make a profit from by selling stuff
to vendors. We have no intention to create trade skills that reward people
for the number of mouse clicks they can make every hour. The intent is to
create trade skills that are profitable when items are sold to other
players, allowing (forcing) them to deal with other people to make their
money.
