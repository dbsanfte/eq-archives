Scene: Ssra Temple.
Location: Emp room, having just divied up spoils from Emp, and preparing
to leave.

GM says out of character, 'Ladies and Gentlemen, can I have your
attention please'
GM says out of character, 'I regret to inform you that I must kill the
Emperor for a short time'
50 guildies say out of character, 'It's dead Jim'
GM says out of character, 'Well, he will not respawn'
GM says out of character, 'The Cursed will not be back as well'
50 guildies say out of character, 'He's dead too Jim'

It's not like we were getting loot we couldn't have gotten under regular
circumstances - we haven't failed emp/cursed in months - just found it
funny.

Our stuff is paraphrased, GM stuff is word for word. I could post a
screenshot, but it's got some stuff in raid chat, and every time we post
the name of our channel, someone will get on before us after a patch and
gank our channel heh.
