And so does mine... so what? Does that mean I should immediately stop 
what I'm doing and go taunt the mob off the others? And what if they're 
doing ok. What if they've rooted and I don't see it and break root? 
That's fine and all but wouldn't your time be better spent learning 
aggro management?

Well there ya go. Are you saying you were getting overpulls too often?? 
Then that should be something to work out with the puller.

Among other things, yes.

In the context you put it? Yes. You assume that the tanks were NOT 
paying attention if the two mobs left them. IF you had said they left 
and you had to begin running because you said you had a mob on you and 
they didn't pay attention enough to come taunt it off you then, yes, it 
is unfounded.

Again, isn't that something to be worked out with the puller? If you're 
pulling obscene amounts of reds and yellows then YES you NEED an 
enchanter and even then it might not be enough. Why not NOT live 
dangerously then?
