You're mispelling FARMING.  :)

One group of mid 50's can do hate first floor for armor drops.  Two
groups can do it very, VERY safely.  3 groups would be bored to tears.
4 or more groups, and you start playing "who can start the biggest
train" games.

Just find a couple of tanks, a competent enchanter, a few rogues and
go slap some mobs around.  Hate mobs are no more difficult than krups
in Sebilis (ok maybe a tiny bit more difficult).

The biggest obstacle you'll most likely find is finding Hate
unoccupied.
