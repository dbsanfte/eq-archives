    Because camping an item sucks, Lokari, pure and simple. I cannot imagine
a more boring use of one's online time than sitting in one spot for hours on
end because the one thing you desire - the Hat of Bad Graphics - *only*
drops there. When all you need are plat and XP to get desired items, the
world is your oyster.

    Assuming you CAN get it from them. If you are motivated to go to camp X
to get an item for use, most others will be as well - and they won't sell,
or will over-value what they have.

    This won't be a problem in EQ today, I don't think. There's too much
twink gear already out there, and too many zones where farming CAN occur.
But if those zones were TCC'ed in, say, EQ2.... <shudder>

    Dungeons are different critters than outdoor zones. Even high-level
players frequent rely on the presence of other high-level or
appropriate-class characters to save their bacon. Deaths can scatter a
party's members well away from the dungeon, requiring resses (a higher-level
service), and getting to bodies can require clearing a path (another
higher-level specialty).

    Last night's example: Sol B, group is too stupid for words (long story),
all of them but a monk and myself (rogue) die deep inside. Had the monk not
been Feigned beside some of the bodies, we would have required one of the
Fungi-clad monk soloists in the dungeon to clear a partial path to the
bodies so I could get at them (bats see through sneak/hide). Then, the dead
players (some bound a ludicrous distance away) required the services of the
Ragefire-camping cleric also in the zone to res them back.

    Dying due to lack of due dilligence is one thing. But high-levels can
frequently find a zone bug and report it, hopefully to be fixed, before it
smokes some hapless group of players that should be there. Like the Vox
breath weapons that were on the goos on the third floor of Dalnir at
release - high levels that could deal with the CR (and in some cases, with
the Goos) found out about this, reported it, and it was fixed. Imagine being
an appropriate-level party stumbling across THAT - all your melees sent back
to FV or OT, and bodies piled in the bottom of a one-way dungeon.

    Agreed. It will eventually get there, if the zone isn't a deathtrap.
Non-factor.

    That's a problem in and of itself. Wasn't one of our signs of impending
doom someone saying "I know the perfect place for us to go" ? People don't
want to go places that could eat an entire play session with LFG followed by
travel followed by CR. The best thing to encourage exploring seems to be the
one thing that doesn't happen often - the creation of a well-thought out,
logically planned zone. Next time you're in Lake of Ill Omen, look at what
level mobs can be found in what areas. Think about that. People aren't still
there just because they think the zone still has an XP modifier.

>>It destroys the role playing enviroment.
>
>How? In detail, please.

    Insofar as a game where the bad guy comes back 20 minutes later has a
roleplaying environment, it makes no sense that the Crown of the Kobold
Kings is missing if someone level X kills him, but WILL be present if
someone of level X-1 is present. It also destroys a lot of interactivity
with NPCs. Say my level 43 rogue is in Stonebrunt. I talk with the cats, and
they tell me they will reward me for the heads of heretics. Yet I can kill
every heretic in the zone, and none drops a head (TCC). I can't complete the
quest, and find out more about the cats. The "Release The Souls" quest in
Stonebrunt involves what looks to be a LOT of lore about the area and the
conflicts there - but I can't access it unless I send in a low-level
character. So for me not only is Stonebrunt not a place to gather phat lewt,
it isn't a part of the mythology of Norrath - it's some artificial, tack-on
zone.
