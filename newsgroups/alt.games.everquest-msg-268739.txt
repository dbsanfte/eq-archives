I have no recollection of learning to read, either, being 47.  However, my
parents have always told me that I was reading before I entered Grade 1.

Which Tom Swift?

Actually, that's probably the same one I have.  Tom Swift Jr.  First book
was Tom Swift and his Flying Lab.  Second one was, I think, the Jetmarine.
So on and so forth.  I've got all 34 of them on the shelf in my secondary
computer room.

Before Tom Swift Jr. was Tom Swift.  And I think there was another series of
Tom Swift stories even before that.  The earliest one was, I think, Tom
Swift and his Motor-Cycle, written before 1900.
