Octopi are just about the most intelligent animals if we judge them purely 
by being able to learn from their peers and manipulate their environment. 
They have been observed opening fairly complicated containers the first 
time around, after watching another octopus succeed in opening it after a 
few tries.

Yes, animals are a lot more like us than it's comfortable to admit...

That's the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, and you are right, it has been rather 
convincingly disproved... It basically amounted to racism by another name. 
What brings the hypothesis crashing down is the common occurence that 
*everybody* has thoughts and feelings that they have a hard time expressing 
in words... If thought was shaped by language, that situation would never 
arise. On the other hand, language *can* shape attitude, hence the 
importance of, for example, moving towards gender-neutrality whenever 
possible.
