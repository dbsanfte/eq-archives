Please expand on this for me.  And to be very specific, help me out with exactly
where it ceases to be "tactics" and becomes an "exploit" in the example I cited and
will specify/expand on below:
I decide to take my wizard to go solo hunting in the gorge. Aside from the overall
stupidity of soloing a wizard, I think we can assume I'm not exploiting anything thus
far. <grin>
  Rather than going and standing out at the intersection where every mino, muddite,
and goblin paths past, I decide to use nuke pulling to fight my mobs a little ways
back up the entrance canyon to avoid adds.  I'm assuming I'm still not exploiting, as
every place I have grouped thus far there has been a selected "pulling spot" for this
purpose. "No adds good. Fighting right in pathing area bad."
  Now, a mino reaches the intersection and I nuke him. As he aggros and runs towards
me, I notice he's taking an awfully stupid looking route to reach me, but I /shrug
and figure that's his problem, and I try to get my root spell off. I stick it, but as
usual it lasts almost exactly one second and before I can get another nuke off, the
mino is in my face and hammering on me.
  Now, I'm not a tank. I'm a finger waggler. If I were a tank, my natural reaction
would to be to stand and go toe to toe. But I'm an easily frightened, fragile little
wiz and my reaction is to get out of his bashing range. I back up a few steps while
getting ready to try to recast root. To my great surprise and pleasure, the mino
suddenly starts running across the canyon. While he's jogging, I finish getting my
root off and it sticks. This time I get a couple more nukes off, and I'm well ahead
in the battle on hit points. But, root breaks and here he comes again.
  Remembering what I learned last time, I once again back up to avoid getting beaten
to a pulp, and there he goes off jogging again. Yippee! I cast root once more, a
couple more nukes and he's gone.
  Please tell me what the invisible GM is going to say to me when they show up 20
seconds later?
1)  You have to stand still while the mino beats on you and try to cast your spells
that way.
2)  If you're going to run away from a mob you can't just run a little ways, you have
to run all the way to the zone and exit the gorge.
3) If you notice the Mino running on a funny path, you can't try to cast again until
he reaches you and starts beating on you.
4) You can't pull to this spot.
5)  Other?

And please allow me the luxury of cutting you off at the pass with what I expect
would be the "textbook response".  I can easily guess that the first answer would be
as follows:
GM_01 says: 'You are exploiting the pathing of the Mino, and if you continue to do
this you will face disciplinary action.'

Let's both go live in the real world for a second, Biz, and make *you* the GM. Assume
that simply saying "you're exploiting" isn't a full enough answer, and you somehow
feel compelled to give an *explantation* for *why* it's an exploit, and more
importantly what I ___*should*____ be doing if I wish to hunt minos from that spot.
(This is the important part of the question, Biz. So pay attention. You say I'm doing
it wrong. Tell me how to do it right. You're the GM now.)

If your answer is, "Well, that's just the way it is and Verant will tell you it's an
exploit, so you can't do it.", then ok. We have nothing further to discuss. I'm just
curious, since you seem strongly motivated in this thread to defend this stance,
whether you have any concrete reasons or explanations to back up the VI response to
my questions above, or if you're simply saying, "Verant says so, even if it can't be
justified, so that's that."
