Just visited there...   Some good info..... but, one page I read there said
that at 35 you would need to group up, as all the mobs that are blue, will
kill you?  Blue mob..kill a druid....huh?.....naw!!  That was somewhere in
the 35+advanced tactics section, I have a fairly low wis (147) druid, who
has solo'd his way upto 39....very easily and still going strong....  I have
friends who have solo'd to 51+ np, untwinked.  Read everything carefully
there I say...some of it 'could' be misleading if that one page is anything
to go by, especially as you said you are looking for hunting guides, that
one sucked.

/e ducks his head and waits for the flame bombs to hit
