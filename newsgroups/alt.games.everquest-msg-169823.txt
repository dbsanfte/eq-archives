Nah.  If you don't want our banded armor, then you can stay over on 
Prexus with your stinky old uberguild.

And the like, 80 plat off that sand giant. First time I've ever scoffed 
at the tiny cost of level 1 spells :)

I think it's just because of the "it's the fastest there is" thing.  
It's like men and cars.  It may guzzle gas so fast you could never 
afford to buy it, but IT'S A REALLY COOL CAR.

No, but I'm a rogue who's addicted to shammy buffs.  I thought perhaps 
there would be AAs to improve or extend buffs. *g*

True.  I *could* start a shaman on my other account, but I'm too happy 
playing my rogue (and necro, if I ever again stop going LD at random
