>>This is
the format that is needed to be in the email.

Account=*account name*

Password=*password*

Server=*server* (if your server has 2 names, just type in the first name.
Also, you must edit your character information by server, so if one
character you would like to edit is on Tallon, and another on Prexus then
you would have to view each character list seperatly)<<

Here, I'll post it to ya right here.

Account= Youragimp
Password= Nicetryasshat
Server= Fuckoff

That work for you? *smirk*
