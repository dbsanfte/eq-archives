At the point where ulthorks weren't giving a satisfactory xp return for
the time invested quadding them.  They were the last mobs where I could
use CoF and take them down in (usually) one stretch of BoF. There are
probably some niche mobs out there where it could still be done, but it
hasn't been worth the effort so far. I don't have the manapool to take
down wyverns with CoF, and I'd have to resnare at least 3 times.

The birds in TD are great xp, but again quadding with CoF is out of the
question. I found that I could easily quad the lightfoots using CoF with
about two casts of BoF, but if you know that zone you know that getting
four lightfoots without picking up a watcher/proven is next to
impossible. Watchers have significantly more HP than the lightfoots (or
is that lightfeet?) and killing them with CoF is dicey at best. Provens
are often still standing after two ice comets and a conflag so killing
them via my level 34 AoE is out of the question.

I have all the spells in the bank through 55 that are drop spells. Don't
have any quest/turn-in ones yet. I don't bother buying the vendor spells
until just before/after dinging because it just eats up bank space.
