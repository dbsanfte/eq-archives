This just strikes me as a complete overreaction.  The point was that you 
-can- convey more accent per oddly-configured word if you minimize the 
changes and concentrate them near the ends of the sentence.  And depending 
on how much accent you wish to convey, that could easily be enough.  I saw 
nothing in the forwarded teacher's advice that said that was the only way 
to do it.
