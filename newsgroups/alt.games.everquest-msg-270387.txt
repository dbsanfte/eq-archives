Well, went and registered, which means putting in a whole boatload of 
information, but specifically does -not- require any CC or billing 
information; there's a step where you -can- put that info in, and you're 
told that if you do then when your free period is over you'll 
automatically get charged, but its very clear and simple how not to do so.

Finally got to the submit page, which took a while to process but 
finally said "done" and then just sat there.

Well, looking at it, I'm supposed to get something via email.  I put my 
real email address in there, so I'm waiting.  Looks like they are saying 
it could take up to 15 minutes.

Check my email box, nothing.

Checked 15 minutes later, nothing.

Half hour, nothing.

45 minutes, nothing.

Went back to the site and tried to log in, with my username and 
password, won't let me in.

Tried to register again, in case I'd done something wrong; says my 
username is already in use.  I hit that with my first attempt at a 
username, and not with this one, when I first registered, so I guess it 
took my new name and is doing -something- with it.

Does this mean that the registration process is jammed up and its taking 
forever to process each new registrant?

Or does it mean I've done something wrong, and I'm not going to get this 
account registered after all?

It was free, I can just make up new user names till I find one that 
works, if I made some numbskull error.

But I can't think what I did wrong, so its hard to correct that.

I guess I'll give it a few more hours, but at this point I'm already 
over 24 hours from time I decided to give AO a try, this is kind of sad 
for a free demo!
