What would I do? Well, before I cost the company $100's of thousands, I 
would probably try just what they did. As a matter of fact, putting 
myself in their shoes, I'm almost certain I would. It makes even more 
sense to me now that they are quick to refund the charge. There's not 
much they *can* do, but there is likely a bottom line that is in 
jeopardy. We have no reason to believe that it was merely a case of them 
choosing the greedy option with all things being equal. That additional 
profit could very well have been mandated well beforehand, rendering any 
thoughts of delaying it a month out of the question.

There was nothing pending about it. The date of the increase was 
established. All charges after that date were to reflect the new rate.

It's no tangent at all, or rather it wasn't until you stepped in. The 
point was that, regardless of the actions of SoE, we, as decent people, 
should conduct ourselves with the same level of integrity we would in 
any other situation. In other words, we shouldn't take advantage of an 
honest mistake as an opportunity to avoid paying an amount we know to be 
correct. Nevermind your complaints elsewhere that they shouldn't have 
"taken liberties" with your credit card. This particular point of 
discussion was about whether a subscriber is justified in disputing the 
charge with the intent of avoiding paying it altogether. It's not about 
offering them morality and ethics, it's all about maintaing that level 
of morality and ethics in your own actions, regardless of minor 
opportunistic circumstances. That should not be dictated by how SoE 
handled the matter. That should be constant.

Which is possibly why they are reversing the charge for people who call 
in. I don't doubt that they eliminated any legal means of collecting 
that $2. That doesn't change the fact that we know it to be a valid 
charge. You merely dispute the methods by which they collected it.

Possibly. The fact remains that there is no reasonable purpose for 
making this so costly, time-consuming and difficult when the legitimacy 
of the charge is valid. They took care of it for you. The *only* grief 
generated was by your own perception that they somehow were 
disrespecting you or "picking your pocket". That's a bunch of crap. I'd 
suggest you just get over it, for crying out loud. It's not like this is 
something they do on a regular basis. As a matter of fact, I don't 
recall anything like this *ever* happening. 

I'm glad they took care of it. It does not indicate any tendancy on 
their part to misuse my credit card. Hell, the only inconvenience it's 
caused me was the compulsion to douse the flames of outrage here.

Hmm...that's a good point. I'm not sure why I bother.
