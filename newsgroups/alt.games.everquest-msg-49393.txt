I find myself becoming more and more frustrated with the mechanics of EQ.  I
would like to poll the group for their oppinions on the matter.  Please try
and keep the responses geared towards the comments WRT (with respect to) the
game and not how I should go find something else to play and /or quit.  I
enjoy the EQ community and love seeing improvements in the game.

"The Vision" was to make the game more enjoyable/playable to groups vice
solo.  The maximum single group size is six.  The game has been expanded
disproportionately to REQUIRE (at 50+) groups larger than six.  Does this
make sense?  It forces the higher end characters to join guilds in order to
play.  I have followed "The Vision" in grouping through to my current level
(almost 55) but there are few places for a [single] group to actually hunt.

There needs to be more [new] content  geared for the 45-55 crowd (maybe even
higher, but im not there yet) that is huntable by a SINGLE group.  It doesnt
have to include uber loot drops, but there needs to be a larger selection of
zones available in this level range.  On a side note there seems to be a
MAJOR equipment gap in this range as well.  (Unless you belong to a larger
guild).  One solution might be making the max group size eight?  (There
seems to be a few zones where six just isnt quite enough but 12 is too many)

The game needs a system that encourages guild cooperation/coordination
between smaller (more personalized) guilds and/or unguilded groups so that
they too have the opportunity to organize "raid" zone hunts.  A new
interface would be helpful here...they made a system for guild wars.  Why
not guild alliance?

Thats it for now....more to come later (maybe).  What are your
opinions/gripes?
