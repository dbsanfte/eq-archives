Admittedly, my Shaman doesn't pull much in lvl 65 LDoN but from what
I've seen in 50s adventures with my ranger pulling, even a single lull
is all you really need, I'll maybe call for more than one lul to split
a room once per adventure.  It's pretty rare that you can't get even a
room full of mobs down to a manageable pull by breaking the agro chain
with one well-placed lull. If it isn't resisted much, I'd think that a
monk lull will be pretty useful. 

Overall, I still like monks as the 2nd best pullers in LDoN behind
bards. ... at least as long as they aren't hung up on pulling singles.
The ability to agro a mob, see how many are coming on the pull and
then decide whether to feign 'em off or bring em back to the group is
still pretty useful imo. 

Bard I was grouped with last night said that they were nerfing bard
lull down to 18 seconds duration, dunno how that one is going to
affect the pulling equation.

Agreed, if SOE felt that a 100% wipe was overpowering, why give it to
bards? If not, why not let monks have it again even it it were on a
longer timer than regular feign. Having to /q out to clear agro is
just silly.
