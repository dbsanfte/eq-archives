matches what I've seen pretty smart melee players do and say.]

The formulae are complicated enough that the only way to really compare this
accurately is by parsing.  And it'll vary by mob.

If you're optimizing your weapons for mobs that you kill in 10 seconds
soloing, you're not playing the same game I am.  Rounding differences from
overkill hits (your last 20 damage on your first mob get wasted) and the
mid-swing delay when switching mobs are pretty irrelevant to most situations.

Only that this particular effect is lost in the noise of mobs that take 45s or
more for a group to kill, and is FAR outweighed by even a small difference
in DPS, or by the cost of ripostes, damage shields, etc. that will hurt
more when dual wielding.

In most cases, pick the weapon set that does the most damage for you, with a
bias toward 2H weapons if it's a close match between the two.
