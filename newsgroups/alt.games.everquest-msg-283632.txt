Bandits in PC: levels 16-20
Fungoids: 15-24
Netherbians: 18-24
Trogs: 19-26

DS or DSP.  Of course the Nexus is also an outdoor zone.

Save the spongy rocks or whatever it is that the Netherbians drop.  It
is one of the best routes to high level tinkering.  (Making corking
devices)  If you do want to tinker, you are going to need lots and

hitting them with Hail of Arrows.  It's kind of fun to watch 30 mobs
all die at once.
