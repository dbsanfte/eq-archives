Granted you don't ask for it.. its just the norm now though.  And Yes you
are supposed to share gems with the group after you recover your costs.

I suggested to a friend he went to Sebilis (ive been 60 a while now, but
back when I was low 50's) who was a cleric.  He wasnt used to dungeon
grouping, so I told him he had to keep everybody symboled who needed it
(using peridots), but he would get to masterloot, and would make his money
back from gems.

In his first day he made 2k, and that wasn't even an optimal exp group (I
wouldn't all out pull if my group cleric was inexperienced)... believe me
there is that kind of money to be made.

Recently I ran a raid for somebody, and they needed money for dots (several
k) and you know how they were going to make their money?  Yes, exp in
Sebilis.  It is a get rich method for clerics in Seb (granted sometimes they
lose out.. but a chanter using Rune V always loses out)

You don't think 500pp isnt much anyway?  500pp for your exp groups in a
night.. maybe 1k+ if you play longer, like its a weekend.  If its a higher
level group then you a) Kill a lot faster and loot more gems, and b) They
generally don't need the spells that drop often.. another 15pp a shot source
of income.  Even if its just 500pp max, thats 1kpp PROFIT every 2 days, on
weekends or days you play longer, that total goes higher and higher.. that
is several k per week.  I can't even dream about cast like that.

You personally don't play in Seb much - I did though, i exped 24/7 in there,
and so did clerics, and believe me the only ones getting rich were them.
