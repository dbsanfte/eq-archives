Never have. At low levels I farmed Spiderling Silks in the Feerott one
zone over while buying pelts at 5p and selling Leather Padding at 25pp
to pay for my Cobalt and other gear as a youngun. Made much more money
in a shorter time than I ever would have on HG's. Doesn't seem that
lucrative these days due to the silk nerf, but I noticed leather
padding going for 45pp at times as a result of the drop rate.

Is most of the guild at least 62+? If so, hit BoT towers for ornate
bp's. Those are barely considered moderate raid targets. If you can
put 20-30 people onsite and work together, there is no reason you
can't farm towers and Vindi so you don't have to work a week or two on
end to get a BP that you'll probably end up replacing anyways once you
do start farming towers. At least if you hold out for Royal Attendant,
along with the nice augs.. regen V.. 40hp etc it'll be in the same zip
code as ornate, at least enough not to warrant an upgrade to it and in
the end waste all the points you accumulated.
