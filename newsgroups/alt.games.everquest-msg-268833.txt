I speak in dialect all the time on Permafrost.  Anybody who doesn't like it
and says so simply goes on my "never" list.  Never help, never group, never
sell to.  Well, I will sell to them, at 2 X what I charge anyone else.

Oh, and I have one idiot on my "harass" list.  Kerran named Nioliop.  Every
time I see him, I harass him.  So far he's thick as a brick.  He actually
asked the people in the tradeskill zone we were in if he should pay me the
money he owes me.  General concensus is that he's a liar and a welcher.
With luck I'll make it impossible for him to get a guild or any sort of
decent rep.
