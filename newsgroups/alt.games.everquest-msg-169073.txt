No doubt true. Not something I tend to think about myself - just a
reflex reaction that inability to move = dead. This is far less
likely to be the case for a melee than a cleric for any number of
reasons.

Of course my usual experience *as* a cleric is of melee HPs slowly
spiralling downwards, which lends weight to the (irrational) view of
melees as terribly vulnerable. :-) When in fact it's *clerics* that
are vulnerable...

I still wouldn't want to hunt FV as a melee though. It was bad
enough as a cleric, and the drachnids are just plain scary. I much
prefer the spiders that *look* like spiders.
