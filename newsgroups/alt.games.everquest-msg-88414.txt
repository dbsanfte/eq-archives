For something to do I have finally decided I want to be welcome in Kelethin.
After already causing an diplomatic incident between the Indigo Brotherhood
and the Crushbone orcs (ie I killed lots of orcs in CB including Crush) I'm
really looking for an easy quest (like the Neriak Wine quest or Misty
Thicket  toilet roll one) to help me out here. This may sound like laziness
but I don't really want to clear out crushbone while people are hunting
there.
I was looking at Allakhazams but couldn't find anything that seemed to meet
my requirements, any ideas?

My options so far are, kill everything in CB (not very helpful to those
levelling) offer myself as a puller to a group in CB (more helpful but means
I have to wait on another group be ready) or kill my own kind in my own
land(I refuse to kill the bridge guards but the guards inside offer no help
to newbies)
