I still can't give up my jade gold bracelets on my mage. 15 mana AND
15  hitpionts..  Level 31 now, only cheap upgrade would be PBB (3 wis
3 int)  but even 3 int will give 18 more mana, I think I'm gonna be
wearing these guys for a few more levels, maybe switch them at 40

I have to laugh when I see people braging about having 200 int at
level 6, they would be much better off with mana items. Idiots.

Heck my mage has been wearing an ishava robe since about lvl 6. Has 50
mana and no int, but at lvl 6 that 50 mana was equal to about 50 int
:) Was interesting to loot corpse and see mana pool goto 25% soon as
put everything on.  

Other advantage of mana items is you don't lose the mana when you get
drunk :)
