Huh? What "natural order"? While I agree that whether something happens 
in nature or not is not necessarily an indicator of its morality, it 
certainly is the only indicator of whether something is "natural" or not. 
I use quotes because I think "natural" is a nonsensical, absurd 
adjective that means nothing and explains nothing.

Homosexuality has been reported in lots of species of mammals and birds. 
Pedophilia has not, so far. If it has, enlighten us with a quote.

Much like playing Everquest, then... It's enjoyable for those who enjoy 
that kind of thing, harms no one, and brings out the bigots, so other 
people can avoid them. Plenty of societal benefit there, I think.
