The reason you see stats like that is because that is what works.
SKs (like Paladins) are primarily tanks, they need HP far more than
they need extra depth to their mana pool.  It doesn't take all that
much mana, on a per fight basis, to cast the spells an SK is gonna
need to cast (compared to a "real" caster who has good reason to
get that deep mana pool).  Tanks need HP and AC first, last, and
always (resists are important in some circumstances as well).  Oh,
and I see a lot of SK gear that has INT on it, which would explain
how those Ogres and Trolls are getting their INT up as high as 120.
