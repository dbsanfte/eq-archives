[top-post fixed]

The one the really gets me is the rod nerf.  I hadn't taken a close look at
the rod numbers before, but now I did.  400 mana to cast, 3 insta-click
charges of 300 HP -> 220 mana.  So, one rod is 900 HP -> 660 mana.  Take
away the 400 mana to cast, so the net is 900 HP -> 260 mana.  Gee...does
anything stand out about those numbers?

It's only a slightly worse ratio than the Manastone--one of the most
overpowering items ever.  That should have raised flags right there.

For the heck of it, I did a little simulation.  Let's have one Mage and one
Cleric.  Let's say they both have mana pools of around 2800.  Mage is buffed
to 2500 HP, Cleric has 3500.  They are starting a fight at full health/full
mana.  I didn't feel like dealing with overlapping things, so for some
reason the Mage and Cleric can't do things at the same time (say, they are
being played by one person on two accounts, and he's not good at it).
Assumptions: Mage can cast a rod and click it three times in one tick.  Mage
can cast a rod, hand it to Cleric, and Cleric can click three times in 2
ticks.  Cleric takes 2 ticks to CH self or Mage, or someone else.

(The mana pool is approximate.  In this sim, when at or above 2500, the Mage
and Cleric consider themselves full, and won't use the rods.  However, if
they use the rods at, say, 2499, I'd let them have all 660 mana).

Let's see what can be sustained.  In this sim, the Cleric casts CH on the
tank whenever the Cleric has 2500 mana or more.  Otherwise, the Cleric and
Mage try to get the Cleric back up in mana.  Here's the first run, with no
other mana regen--not even normal standing mana regen.  All mana is coming
from rods.  The first column is time in ticks.  The lines that say "COMPLETE
HEAL" is when the Cleric heals the tank.  The number after "COMPLETE HEAL"
is the average time between complete heals on the tank.  The other lines
give the Mage and Cleric HP and mana.  The "> xxx <" means xxx uses a rod.
"+ xxx +" means xxx is getting healed.  Here is a little over 5 minutes
worth:

It goes on like that.  The sustained rate ends up being about 12.4 ticks
between CH's on the tank.  That's equivalent to a Cleric with ~FT32.

Now let's put KEI on the Cleric and Mage.  Here's the first 6 minutes.
Notice that there are a LOT more CH's on the tank now.

The interval between complete heals ends up being 7.1 ticks over time.
That's about equivalent to having ~FT56.  Note that when I say the Cleric is
casting CH every 7.1 ticks, I'm just talking about the CH on the tank.  The
CH is also CH'ing himself and the Mage.

Keep in mind that in this simulation, the Cleric and Mage are not
overlapping things.  In RL, the Cleric's heals and the Mage's summoning
could overlap.  So, my sim gives a mana regen rate that is too *low*.

The efficiency of this strongly depends on how many HP the Mage and Cleric
have.  If we can get the Cleric buffed to 4000, leaving the Mage, that
knocks the time down on the tank CH to 6.5 ticks (~FT61).  If we can do
Cleric 4000, Mage 3000, things speed up to 5.5 ticks (~FT72).

BTW, the numbers don't really change if we cut the mana pools of both the
Mage and Cleric way down.  HP is the thing that matters here.

Anyway, I can see now just how overwhelming the rod is.
