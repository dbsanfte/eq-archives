Welcome to one of the most fun classes in the game.

I think one is lighter than the other.  Otherwise they do the same
thing.

The Combine empire.  Combine instruments are 20% better.  You can test
this by using a regular drum and Selos then a Combine Drum.  You will
see the difference.

Single target like Lull spell line. Also you cannot have a weapon in
your hand when you sing this. When I first got the song, I thought it
was broken.  I would sing it at one mob then pull the other and both
would come at me.  Now I always swap my weapons out before using it.
