Numerical baloney. The monsters at hell levels you are fighting go
down in way less time than the higher ones you'll be wanting at L54
and 59. You also pull faster and have far less downtime. Those facts
aren't represented in your number crunching - effectively those
monsters your killing later are bigger numbers than ones earlier.
Suddeny the difference isn't very significant. If you're going to pull
out the numbers at least take everything into account.

Removing hell levels pre-50 will do virtually nothing to speed up
people to *60*. It will reduce the headache for trying to get to those
new spell levels in the 30s and 40s though.
