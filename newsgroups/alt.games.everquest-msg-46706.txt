Necro's don't HAVE to quad kite.  They can just kill and kill and kill
without having to stop to med at all.  Quad kiting is an excellent way
to get exp (4 wyverns = 3/4 of a blue bub at 51) but in the time that
it takes me to kill 4 mobs and med up, a necro can have killed at
least four and is still going.

Granted, my necro buddy doesn't get NEAR as much reading done while
he's doing the exp grind as I do, but there are trade offs.

Sorry, but no.  As long as a necro is smart in what he pulls and
where, the only limitation they have is the number of mobs available
for them to kill.

If druids had the mana regen capabilities that necro's have, THEN we
would be the solo god.  But that really wouldn't be fair.  Damnit. :-)
