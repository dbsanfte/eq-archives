Hey all,

I've had my EQ account for over 2 years now and am interested in
transferring my main character to another server.  For about 6 months
during this 2 year span, my account was being paid for by my
brother-in-law's credit card (as a gift) and I also let him play the
char a lot.  

Anyhow I applied for a transfer and was rejected, saying:

"After reviewing the accounts involved, we have found discrepancies
between the billing and/or registration on the account(s). If you are
not the original owner of the account, or if the account has changed
ownership at any point, we cannot perform a character move. You are
not listed as the owner of the first billed credit card on the source
account."

When I submitted the request I did not enter in any explanation for
billing differences since I had resumed paying for the account with my
original credit card (for a few months).

Any advice would be appreciated,

Denise
