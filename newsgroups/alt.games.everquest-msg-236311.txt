}Hi all. Im a new player to EQ and IM having a bit of a problem.  I
}bought just the basic game then spent about 5 hours downloading new
}updates to it (on cable no less).  I got all the updates expect
}Legends, Legacy of Ykesha and GoD.  A person I met in the game said he
}wanted to take me to the Bazzaar and took me to a book on a
}pedistal(not sure what it was called).  When I clicked on the book it
}took me back to my bind point in the same zone.  Supposedly this isnt
}supposed to happen. I double checked and 1 of the downloads I got was
}the Planes of power that you need to make this work. Any help would be
}appreciated.

Downloading the software for all the expansions is all well and good, but 
you need to actually buy the expansions and use the registration key to 
upgrade your account before they'll be of any use to you.
