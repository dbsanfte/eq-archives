I am led to believe that the shade in PoN, or rather a triggered version of 
him, is part of the druid epic 1.5.  I have noticed as a result that I have 
not seen the normal one up for about a week now.  Anyone know if the 
triggered version is messing up the regular spawn?  My issue is that is the 
last piece I need for the Secrets of the Planes, and I'd love to get that 
quest finally done, but, it is looking pretty hopeless.
