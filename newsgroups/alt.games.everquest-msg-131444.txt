 Not exactly a new thread since this has been beat to death. I,
personally, do not find random awarding of loot to be fair. If someone
doesn't like the way loots are awarded they are more than capable of
finding a guild with policies that better suit their style. Apparently
others agree since you don't see most of the 'top-end' guilds hurting
for players.
