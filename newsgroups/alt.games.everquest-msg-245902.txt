No, I dont have Entrap,there is always something more important
for me to spend aas,especially since GoD is out,Weapon Afinnity
is terrible expensive.  :)

So my usual spell lineup is:

1.Ensnare
2.Tangling Weeds
3.Chloroblast
4.Root
5.Nuke
6.Nuke
7.Eagle Eye(even with SCR3 *sigh*)
8.Buffslot,mostly used for Damage Shield

Uland 65 Hunter
