beats me. Burning wood is a muh better zone imo. much easier to single pull.
As for FM, it does suck imo. After loio i prefer to go straight to OT. giant
fort is just too many double pulls and people training you. Fm isnt so bad
for soloing just north of the fort. mobs dont wander there so its a good
place to med up and kite them around ( or whatever you do)
