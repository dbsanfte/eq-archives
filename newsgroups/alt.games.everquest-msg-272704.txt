Right, in general it doesn't matter when you cast either root or snare.
E.g., if you cast snare after the mob starts its death march, it'll stop
moving (and won't fight).  If it's rooted, it fights (whether or not it's
also snared) until it dies or root breaks.

It's also worth observing that a rooted mob will attack the nearest PC,
regardless of the order on its hate list.  (I think it attacks a PC in
range even if there are pets closer to the mob, but I'm not sure.)
