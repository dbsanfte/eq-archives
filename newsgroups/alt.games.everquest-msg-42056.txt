Saddam Hussein, at this stage, has plenty of harsh language and squirt guns
in his arsenal, but that's about it.

NATO in general and the US in particular has made quite sure for 10 years
that Iraq has no solid military infrastructure to carry out any meaningful
agression, and has made sure to keep Iraq rather impoverished as well. Out
of all the nations in the region, Iraq is the least prepared for conflict at
this point.
