Songs and other buffs like clarity always stack.

What is more important is that the bard lvl 32(?) song doesn't give a 9
second buff like normal, but instead gives a 'chunk' of mana to everyone who
hears it. This in effect means 5 bards can sing this song to you and they
would all stack !

The high level bard song (lvl 54?) is a 9 second buff and is better then
Clarity 2, they also stack.

Now with the RotG, C2, a Flowing Thought item (saw FT 5 somewhere recently)
and a couple of bards, with one refreshing the 9 second mana-reg buff, a
nuker can practically chain-nuke his best spells without running out of mana
:)
And you can get the SoL mana-reg skill as well :)


On a side note: Does someone have the stats of how much mana each spell and
effect gives? I read somewhere that FT5 gives 30 mana per tick. Seems a bit
much to me. Also Breeze is supposed to be +1 mana per tick?
