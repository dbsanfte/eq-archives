The login servers do have their own domain names.  I found a solution on the
tech forums that someone else posted.  Only thing is I have had mixed
results using it.  It did not work Sunday but did work Monday.  I was able
to login and play all evening.  Basically it requires you to modify the host
file that EQ uses to decide which login server you login on.  The problem
with login has nothing to do with the new graphics engine or any of the
patches that have happened over the last few weeks.  Once I was in the game
I played for over ten hours wihtout any crashes.  More than likely it is a
hardware issue with the server itself.
