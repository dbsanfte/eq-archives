You just get flattened by the first KoS wanderer (and believe me, there's a
lot of them)

I've got a level 1 in Kael, I've seen somebody on this group walk a rogue
out to Cobalt Scar below level 5.

There are 2 planar zones though where you can't enter under level 46, Plane
of Growth and Plane of Mischief.

Depending on class though, you can start hunting cougars in Iceclad and dire
wolves in Great Divide around level 28 or so.
