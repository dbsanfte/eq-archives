 hate to be the english teacher here, but i meant "affect"....hey, it's not 
like this post will ever cease to exist, and when my kids google for my old 
screennames (you know they'll all be recorded somewhere in the next 20 
years) in 20 years, i want them to know that their dad was never too tired 
to correct a typo

lazy, yes, as the 2nd big paragraph has an awkward line in it and this isn't 
some kind of report where such things need to be corrected, but ... c'est la 
vie ... and if you're reading this now, future children, please know that 
whatever i did to cause you to try to find fault in me by looking into my 
past, i want you to know that i am thinking forward and catching them as i 
go (or trying) - which might not make me perfect - but i'm still your dad 
and if you're ever born, you better respect that ...
