Actually, at least in a lot of POP encounters, generalists have a lot of
value. The design of a lot of encounters I've run across lately relies
heavily on things like druids keeping mobs rooted out of the way while
the main raid kills something. Bards are hugely helpful for their resist
songs, if you can actually get one to hang out by the healers and nukers
instead of running off to melee or trying to twist so many songs resists
are lost frequently (pet peeve lately. I'm sorry, having mana song up
while that 150mana/tic dot landed because the resist song dropped is
really not that helpful). 

Ranger dps is not to be scoffed at anymore either, shamen are handy not
only for landing slows but curing ae effects and healing while the
clerics are busy keeping the main tank alive, helping to heal rampage
and add tanks, etc.  Beastmasters seem happy to melee and send in their
pets, as well as adding some nice buffs that stack with virtually
everything.

If raid leaders aren't taking advantage of the generalists in the raid
it's the leaders lack of vision, not a deficiency in the generalist's
skills that's to blame.
