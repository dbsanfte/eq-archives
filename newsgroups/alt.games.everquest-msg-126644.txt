That's a good point. However, I must say that I would attribute it to
looking for a simple answer rather than the real truth - a common religious
practice, for that matter. It's almost humourous how a 'divine' passage in a
book was used to end the lives of others based on greed or blind hatred.

Further proof that theocracies are a horrible idea.

Perhaps, but I've always generally questioned what people have told me, and
while my family isn't religious, by any means, it's not like I was
influenced to be Atheist. Also, Christians were never terribly fond of me in
the first place, so I can admit my bias and general dislike for them.

Heh, I'm required by law to make cheap-shots at the high level game,
Christianity, stupid people, faith, and Republicans every once in a while.
Of course, the last four things are pretty close anyhow. (Yet another
federally mandated cheap-shot)

I think I've more or less reserved my spot in Hell.
