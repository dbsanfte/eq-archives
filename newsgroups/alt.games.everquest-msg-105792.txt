Why didn't she ask about alien abductions then?  It's caused as much 
downtime to EQ as hacking/cracking has.  Would you have supported her 
right to ask that question without ridicule?  OK, maybe we were a *bit* 
harsh, but anyone with their own alt.fan* newsgroup should be expected to 
know a little bit more than the average webtv user.

The title of her post was:  EQ hacked?  The text of her post backed it up.  
She believed that EQ was hacked and that's why she couldn't reach it.  
This is someone who is obviously not new to newsgroups, yet she asked one 
of the few hot-button questions.

Bah, I still think someone who is as familiar with Usenet as SilverRaven 
seems to be should know something about basic internet knowledge.  
Especially someone with their own vanity group, stalkers, and supporters.  
I'm thinking troll again.
