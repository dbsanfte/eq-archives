}honestly.

Well, they'll serve me well for the 14+ levels until I can even get 
run1... But I couldn't cast Run1 on others, anyway.  Dang it, I really 
liked the unnerfed version.  Now I gotta wait til I get project illusion 
before I can speed enhance others.  

I had one really good FJBoot moment.  I was wandering about in EC, when a 
newbie with 20% life came running by with an orc centurion hot on his 
tail.  Now normally, when you try to buff a running newbie, you have to 
run ahead of them, stop and turn (so the server knows you're stopped), 
cast, wait the casting time, then discover they'd managed to move past you 
and just out of range anyway, and try again.  But this time, I got to run 
right up behind the newbie and click my fjboots at him without even 
slowing down, and watch him accelerate up to my speed and out of range of 
his ardent fan. :)  It felt really, really cool.

What -I- wish, is when they nerfed it, they'd nerfed it like they used to 
nerf Circlet of Shadows and the original DE mask.  Then I could keep my 
good one, and it wouldn't be unbalancing.  But I know, I'm dreaming. :)

I really woulda liked it if they'd stayed targetable, but hey, I'll live.  
At least I was only in line for 8 hours, and slept for 4 of those hours. 
Ssh!  Don't tell the other folks who were in line, I don't think they 
noticed. :)
