Ok so Im only Druid 56, but hey, Im getting there.
Couple of questions regarding mana/KEI etc.
My unbuffed wisdom is 232.
I usually stack KEI with Spirtual Radience? This helps my mana regeneration?

1. With KEI adding 25 to my wisdom it stops at 255, is this a level
limit/cap?

2. Are there any other spells that will also stack with KEI and SR that will
aid my mana regeneration?

3. I have no "focus" "flowing thought" items, apart from a mana preservation
item, I assume I should now try and buy some mana regen items, without
losing the wisdom? If so, when in the bazaar what is the search criteria for
such items?

4. Could someone make a couple of suggestions as to what items regarding
mana regeneration I should seek?

I currently have around 25k available but wouldnt yet wish to spend it
all...

Thanks in anticipation.
