You don't stop regaining health/mana/stamina the instant you have
no food in your inventory.  It takes a while.  First you get
the "you're out of food/drink" messages, then you get the
"you're hungry/thirsty" messages, and eventually you get
to the point where you're starving badly enough that
your regen halts completely.  I haven't done it in a long
time, but IIRC it takes a few hours to get to that stage after
the food actually runs out.
