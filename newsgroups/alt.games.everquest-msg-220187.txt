My apolgies, I overlooked the "and difficulty" part of your
post.  But "difficulty" is partially an artifact of your tactics
in dealing with a given mob; imagine a mob with low HP but high
regen compared to one with high HP but low regen; for someone
with high burst DPS the first mob is easy and the latter
difficult, for someone with low but steady DPS on the other hand,
the latter mob will die if it doesn't kill you first but the
first mob might be unkillable.

Similarly my cleric routinely killed the Cobalt Drakes in CS,
finding their low HP and slow running speed ideally suited to a
fear and nuke strategy, while they were assiduously avoided by
the many higher level druids and wizards that frequented the
place; they weren't quaddable and their nuke plus dispell trick
was devastating for people relying on SOW to outrun them.

And my bard happily chewed up chromodracs, laughing all the while
as they DOTTed and then dispelled their own DOT since he had no
other buffs on at all, just snared and chanted them to death
while they followed him around trying to figure out what was
going wrong; that same mob was a serious threat to a
shaman/warrior team that was relying on a buffed and hasted
warrior to do the killing.

I'm sure you can come up with dozens more examples of mobs that
are hard for one person or group and cake for another, despite
the two groups (or individuals) being similar level and rough
value of gear.

> Easily kitable mob = low exp for its level.

Representing yet another nerf on soloers, who tend to be the ones
doing most of the kiting?

> Summoning mob = more exp.

Summoning mobs are devastating if you are trying to keep them at
a distance and kill them over there.  But if you plan (as most
groups do) to go head to head against them, they aren't any
harder than regular mobs.  So should you give them more exp to
accomodate the root and shoot plans, or not?

> Mob is a caster = more exp.

Casters are a favorite of my bard, they make excellent pets and
die easy.... sure wish they hadn't nerfed pet's healing PCs out
of existance, but Wizards and the like are still tons of fun. 
More exp for something thats more helpful?  Great deal! 
Likewise, my cleric tended to chew up casters and spit them out;
stunning keeps them from casting, trying to cast wastes some of
their melee output, and they

ALso, having to go thru and do this on a case by case basis, even
without worrying about who is doing the killing, is a tremendous
case load to dump on the developers at this late date.

ZEMs aren't nearly as hard, because they apply to whole zones;
thats just one more number per zone.  Problem is, they seem to
have decided on ZEM's in much the same way you are looking at
MEMs (Mob Experience Modifiers); which is to say based on a
limited range of whats easy and whats difficult, and not taking
into account that players tend to work until they find ways to do
things that might seem hard if the reward is high enough.  

My plan, rudimentary as it is, is designed to respond directly to
what people are doing: if they start going to zone A because some
mob or set of mobs there are easy, then the exp on those mobs
starts to drop as more and more people come along.  Meanwhile,
zone B which used to be the hot spot gradually gets deserted
until the exp for killing those mobs raises up to where it
becomes worth while to stay.
