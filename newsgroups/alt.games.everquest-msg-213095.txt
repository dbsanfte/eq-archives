I want my money back!

  Ok, now that I've got that out of my system.... Ever since the patch
two days ago when I click through the character selection screen, I get
dumped back to the server selection screen.  I went to the EQ live
website and went into their live chat.  After a false start I got a tech
that said that they know of the problem and are working on it.  When I
asked for an ETA I got no love.  He also gave a list of files to delete,
which we did on Lenny's machine, but that didn't work.  

   So, anyone else here having this problem?
