Yah, and based on your fun with it I've started an Orge Warrior twink.
I thought about a troll, but I really don't like the looks of the
trolls, and I have a hatred of the trolls based on some experiences in
Grobb with invis, sneak, and hide.  The ogres have alwasy treated my
bard much better, even when invis dropped.

I don't play for levels or experience any more, mainly because most of
my play time is taken up with guild hunts.  As a bard I'm lucky enough
to be able to get into the experience group more than many support
classes (typical guild raid is 18-24 folks, big one is 30-40 plus
friends from outside the guild), and my guild is working hard to get
me to 53, then to 55.  I played for about 5 hours Sunday night and 2
hours last night and didn't get a single bit of exp, I even lost some
due to 2 deaths even getting to the group.  By the same token, I made
3 blue bubbles in Hate on Saturday, and would have made more had we
not been there solely to support a smaller guild on their first Hate
run.  
In a good exp group, doing non-stop pulls, I can do about 1 blue
bubble per hour, I think.  I just haven't been doing much exp hunting,
so I may be off.  I also seem to spend a lot of time in a group with a
58 cleric, 59 warrior, 60 warrior, 56 shaman, and one other 55+.
(Guild does it enough that you just end up grouping with the same
folks, no need to discuss every action.)  I do know I can get some
really good experience if I'm the manapump in an AE caster group
playing around in KC or similar dungeon, but the 60s don't get a lot
of exp there.
Basically, it's about 3-4 times as slow 51+ as it was 46-50.  If I
were in it for the level I'd be seriously miffed.  Since I'm in it for
the fun of killing big bad mobs, I don't even worry about what my exp
bar is doing most of the time.  (Quick example:  This weekend we did a
big Chardok raid, fought our way in, took out Herbalist, Prince, King,
then Prince again.  Somehow a mob aggrod and pulled the entire King
room, including the King, on us when we were just finished with the
Prince.  We took out the entire train of about 15 50-53ish mobs plus
the King without a single death.  That's way cooler than a bit of
yellow on the bar.  We repeated it last night with some out of guild
friends.  They were more than a bit impressed.  Now if we could just
get the damn Queen instead of having her jump us when we're not yet
buffed, mages don't have pets buffed, and healers OOM.)
