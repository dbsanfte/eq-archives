The kyoto treaty specifically targetted the uninted states for reduction in
polution levels. I must assume that you never read it to think it was a good
idea. The uninted states is a minimal producer of pollution on the world
stage. Thus the treaty would have severely hurt our intrests while not doing
a damn thing about polution. The socialists and anti american crowd has
chosen to try and use the enviromental movement to further its goals . This
is unfortunate in that instead of furthering socialists goals it is
destroying the enviromental movement which is worthy. If the
enviromentalists wish to have any chance on keeping their dream alive they
desperately need to divorce themsleves from the socialist anti americans.

Everytime anyone mentions an arms reduction treaty I think back on the
cartoon of a man running in a field with a treaty in his hand . He is
screaming THIS CANT BE HAPPENING we have a treaty. A nice view of missles
from above rounds out the view. I am fairly sure that we will not produce
more of foo weapon then we think we might need and am thus naturally
suspicious of anyone who wants us to produce less of foo weapon.
