None. I don't consider time spent on a leisure activity an
"investment".

If you want to know how many hours I've played, I can't say. I've
played MMO's starting with EQ for over 6 years now. Before then I
played MUDs and various single player games. I can't honestly say that
I spend more of my free time gaming now than I did before MMOs.

I don't know, I don't buy the who serious addiction thing. The
addiction isn't any more in MMOs than regular games. Just that MMOs
appeal to more people who weren't really into gaming before.
