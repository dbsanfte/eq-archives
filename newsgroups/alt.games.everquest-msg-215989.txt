I've only been playing a week with the expansion, and don't play a caster,
so take this for what its worth, but I've had the opposite experience so
far.


I have yet to hear anyone complain about resisted roots in LDoN, even in the
groups where we used root parking extensively (mostly 65 groups).  Neither
the bard nor the enchanters I've grouped with in the last couple days
appeared to have any difficulties with mez.  (mostly high 40's groups)

But today, the cleric was reporting unusually high resists on pacify. (Level
65 group)    She pulled 3 trains using it, and was smooshed one of those
times.
