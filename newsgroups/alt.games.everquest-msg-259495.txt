I experienced this recently.  When I play games, though, I usually like to
finish the game (or in this case, get a level 65), then start over and sort
of lose interest as I get like half way through.  I got my necro, who was my
first character (not counting the ones I experimented with when I first
started playing cuz then I was just trying to figure out which class to
play), to level 51, then I was off to Tunare and I created a bard, then a
mage, then a paladin, then a monk, then a chanter.....anyway, I sort of got
hooked on each character for a while (except the chanter, who is still level
1) and now I'm back playing my necro and trying to earn some AA's.  But on
Tunare I've got 2 30's, a 12, a 25, and (sadly) a 1.  Now I'm once again
hooked on my necro.  Keep in mind that all this happened within a few
months....Hell, give me two more months off school and who knows what new
characters might show up in Norrath! (maybe a healer is next....)
