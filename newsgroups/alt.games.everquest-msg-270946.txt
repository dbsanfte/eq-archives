You have some valid points here,but I am pretty sure they now make
considerable less profite compared to the time when only EQ1 exists.
Only way for them to reach the old profite margin again would be to
pull the plug from EQ1,which we will see not too far in the future.

Of course this is all speculation,but I see no official statements
about the number of sold copies of EQ2,this leads me to the
assumption that the number cannot be very impressive like
the 250k sold copies of WoW on day 1 of release.
