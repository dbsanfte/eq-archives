Ok, I just briefly scanned the other responses, so I hope I don't repeat
anything...

Yes, lower levels can be boring for a lot of people.  Your powers are very
limited and practically anything out there can kill you.  That's what makes
gaining levels so exciting each time you get one; more hit points,
abilities, etc.  I haven't played a warrior, but I know they periodically
gain additional offensive and defensive skills which increase their
badass-ness. (I don't think that's really a word :)

For any type of spell caster, gaining a level doesn't mean as much if it
isn't a spell level (4, 8, 12, etc. for pure casters, 5, 9, 13, etc. for
healing types).  However, you still gain hitpoints, mana, etc.  BUT, each
time you gain a spell level, assuming you've saved up some cash, your powers
leap forward and you can suddenly take on a whole new range of creatures.
You magician, for instance, doesn't get his first pet until level 4.  So,
levels 1 - 3 can be a pain.  Just tough it out until you get level 4 and
I'll bet you enjoy your mage quite a bit.

"any one want to form a group of lvls 1 -4?"  All I can tell you is that the
vast majority of players prefer to solo during those levels.  Grouping so
low can really slow down your experience rates and take you even longer to
get to your serious levels.  Depending on where you are you might start
finding groups around 5 - 7 killing giant spiders, orcs, whatever, but even
then quite a few players wait until levels 8 or even later before they
actively group.

Sight-seeing can be difficult as low levels.  The higher you get the fewer
creatures out there that can cut short your trip.  :)

If you're doing a /tell to a particular player and they don't respond,
they're either rude, extremely busy, or offended by something you said.  If
you were a level 4 warrior you told me "Hey, I'm a young warrior in need of
some cash for a new sword.  Can I borrow some plat?" then you wouldn't hear
from me.  Others will most definitely respond to you but most likely not in
a pleasant way.  ;-)  I also find it to be a bad idea to /tell someone you
haven't actually met and you are not talking to face-to-face.  I really
don't like messages out of the blue asking me if I want to group when the
person hasn't met me and I haven't asked to group, but that's just my
personal pet peeve.  Because the new server is so insanely active in the
newbie areas, it could be that some of your messages are getting lost in the
chat chaos.  Also, make sure you have the messaging mechanism down:

/tell Aragorn Hey, how's it going?
  -- This sends Aragorn (and only Aragorn) a message no matter where he is

/say Hey, how's it going?
  -- Anybody in a relatively close area will hear this

/shout Hey, where's the zone to Neriak?
  -- The entire zone will hear this and hopefully a nice player will direct
you to the zone

/ooc Hey, anybody see X2 last night?
  -- The preferred way to have zone-wide discussions not in character.  Many
people filter out /ooc chat so they can focus on the game.

/auction Selling a rusty long sword for 2 gold!
  -- The preferred way of selling an item in each zone

/r  --or-- /reply That's great, I appreciate the advice.
  -- To directly respond to the last /tell somebody sent you

Finally, let me say that if you just give this game some time and work out
the early game kinks, I'm sure you'll come to love it as much as the rest of
us.  You need to find someone who can sort of show you the ropes.  What's
your character name on the new server?
