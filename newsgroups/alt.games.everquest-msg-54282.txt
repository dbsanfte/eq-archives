When I logged in friday, a message popped up abot all these events going on
this weekend.  Everyone probably know what I'm talking about; scavenger
hunters and a few others...  all of which I never saw or heard word of in
the game or at 'Harpy's Tavern.'   Everytime I log on, even still, I get the
'System Message' roughly saying things are not as they seem.
What I want to know, is this all high level stuff?  Is that why I have no
idea what they mean?  Is it to give the 50+ crew something to do?

Just wondering!
