The following will proberly wrap btw, but check it out:

Now, I tend to be a little overly suspicious by nature but I'll be stuffed
if I can figure out how someone can "legitimately" acquire 35 seperate level
50+ accounts for sale all at the same time, all on different servers and all
without attracting unwanted attention from standing at EC tunnel and
/shouting "wtb, your 50+ account for real cash".

Why would anyone risk a minimum paying job of getting verbally abused day in
and day out? Well - I can think of 13,890 reasons why. That's 13,890 USD
minimum they stand to get from the accounts if all are eventually sold...

Of course I could be just paranoid...
