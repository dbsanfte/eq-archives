Not really.  In theory that's how it works but, much like a paladin,
at higher levels the mobs all resist the first 3 lines.  I've had very
rare occasions where the second from top stun landed.  Even the top
stun is resisted far more than I would like.

I would argue it is indeed the mana required, not the recast time.
However my mana pool is fairly shallow at 6k, at least comparitively.
I can nuke fairly regularly but run out of mana, or get summoned.
Either one is not a "good thing".

Our best PBAOE is just over 1k if I recall correctly, maybe close to
2k (that's already bit me once today...) and while it may hit
unlimited targets it will also garner you unlimited aggro.  A surefire
way to buy the farm.

Ya know, I skip over alot of things because of our guild.  Ready made
groups when we play that consist of a warrior, necro, shaman, bard,
and rogue (me as cleric).  So I never really fear, that's the necro's
job.  We only occasionally hit undead mobs, though when we do it's
more akin to a gang rape rather than a battle.

I guess my views are very skewed by way of comparison.

True enough.  Most raiding clerics are just one in a line of 20
CH'ers.  maybe you are lucky and get the fast heal job, but otherwise
it's just monkey the CH hot key and hope you don;t get AE'd.
