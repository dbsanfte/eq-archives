EQ on a Mac? Perish the thought!

Filesharing was a mixed bag - kazaa lite worked but emule did not. EQ
itself worked fine, but the patcher did not - it was the patcher that
guaranteed a freeze every time when it started its download. There was
no pattern I could see to when it would stop working while browsing.

A google search is showing a lot of people having same problem even
with different models.. but no fix has jumped out yet, its almost like
there isn't one yet.
