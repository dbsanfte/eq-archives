Alla still have all the info for free, the only stuff available to
members only is the extra website stuff like extra searching tools,
profiles and the like. It is still completely useable for free. Even
though I rarely use the extra tools, I still ponied up the $10 because
it's such a small amount, and it's the only comprehensive site remaining
with that degree of free access. Used to use eqlizer too, but even the
publicly submitted screenshots are password protected. I'm not going to
submit items I can't even view unless I pay for it, so now Alla is the
only site getting my SSs from new items. I imagine others feel the same.
