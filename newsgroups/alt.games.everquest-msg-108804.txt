2 tainted seafuries can be up at the same time, therefore 2 corrupted
furbies can also be up at once, but the corrupted *only* pops when a tainted
is killed (and it pops instantly at the corpse)

Any mob over level 50 can theoretically summon.. there are sometimes
exceptions where they don't summon (but they are few and far between)

Im not sure of the Tainted's level range.. last time I was there, it was
about level 52.. so yes he can summon too.

The corrupted is 58-60 (been a while since I killed him) and isn't actually
that tough... I helped a random_druid kill it, back when I was level 52 or
so on my monk.

The druid was 57 and kept it snared, the enchanter was 58 (and kept it
feared), and me 52monk killed it

He can be killed by 2 people (I guess 1 if they don't mind taking a big
risk.. oot is a shitty place to find a rez) when a 60 necro friend came to
help me with the AC camp, he wouldn't try to Corrupted solo though - he said
him and a shaman (to slow) could easily kill it though

As for recycle time on Summons...  I must of been summoned a zillion times
now, and I still don't know heh.. Id say its about 10-15 seconds, but its
hard to tell really in the spam of battle
