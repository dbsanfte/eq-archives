I don't know if it's always been that way, but the same thing put
a friend of mine into a deathloop the other day.  She was camping the
tainted/corrupted aqua goblin in Lake Rathetear, so she bound underwater,
thinking if she died she'd be ready to rock again.  But when she did die,
she zoned back in drowning, instead of with a full air bar.  Rinse, repeat.
