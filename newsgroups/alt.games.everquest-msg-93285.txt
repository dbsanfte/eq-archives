41 or 42, somebody tried to C2 me for SoW at 40 and it wouldn't stick, but
then I came back from an AFK in 42 and some kind enchanter had C2'd me. (did
41 solo real fast so didnt get to try C2 then)

Believe me, when you get your first taste of Crack2, you'll never (want to)
go back.

Now I just want Koadic's
