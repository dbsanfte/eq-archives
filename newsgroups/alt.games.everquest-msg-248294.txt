Some tripe.

They have to do EQ2 in order to compete. EQ1 continues to get MORE
numbers, but this won't continue forever. If they don't make EQ2, they
will waste the everquest trademark for MMORPGS while their
subscription numbers dwindle. They will become like the fools at EA
who said, "why finish and realease ultima2 when we have ultima one?
We'd compete with ourselves!!!"  Exactly, but it is better to compete
with yourself than have another company compete with you while your
game lays there dying.

They'd be fools to not make eq2, just as EA were fools to not do
ultima 2.
