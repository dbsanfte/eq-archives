<snip prize winning (non)rant.>

Okay, I'm putting you up for some sort of award here.
Mr. Rimer has not only posted a cleverly put together
tongue in cheek piece, but has managed to catch quite
a few fish with this bait.  Even some who should now
better.

We've seen these attempts before.  Hell, I've even made
a few.  There is something artful about this whole thread,
though.  Something different from the rest.

What say you group?  Isn't there some kind of a.g.eq award
or title we can bestow upon Mark, here?
