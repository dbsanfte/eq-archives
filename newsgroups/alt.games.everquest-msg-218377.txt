Doh, now I'm getting attacked from two sides.

Look, my intention was never to say, "People who have disease XYZ
shouldn't breed."  I was merely pointing out the fact that some
people with serious genetic issues, who have a non-trivial chance
of passing it onto their children, decide to breed anyway, and I
feel they're being irresponsible.

A qualified doctor would be able to determine which genetic issues
are considered serious vs. non-serious, and determine the chance of
passing it onto children.  Actually, since it's such a sticky
subject, the opinions of several doctors would probably be good.

(Please don't respond with, "What doctors?  How many doctors?  How
experienced do they need to be?"  This seems to be the direction
this thread keeps going, and I'm failing to see why I'm getting beat
up over it.  Perhaps you can enlighten me.  Apparently I stepped on
some people's toes, and I assure you, it wasn't on purpose.)

I agree with your point.  I never intended to express that I should
be the deciding factor.  If I posted something to that effect, please
let me know.

Err, now I'm really confused.  When did I say I didn't want to have
children?  I'm wondering if you're mistaking me for someone else...

Ack, you've surely taken my comment in a way I completely didn't mean
it.
