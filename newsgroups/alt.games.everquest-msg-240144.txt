IIRC, the stonemites in the hall con indifferent unless fighting
something near them. So... just walk past if you've cleared any
previous agro. Probably the most amazing thing about GoD, though.. its
so incredibly unforgiving. Literally from the time you start to the
time you finish there is little room for any mistakes. You fuck up,
you usually wipe, plain and simple. The deepest i've been in the first
GoD trial was 8 of 9 dead. When fighting the 8th one we had one of the
funky guy adds that run sow speed, one missed snare on him after the
8th dead was all it took. It ran into the stonemite hallway and the
agro from 8-10 mobs wiped us in a heartbeat.

IIRC, I reverse-corner tanked in the water. Healer had to be in the
water to land heals on me, npc damagers(slow/nuke/dot) could be out.
The cornering was grand in that it really had nowhere to go. As long
as the slow landed and the heals came on time it was a pretty simple
beatdown.
