Well, thats on the board. There was an in game poll I believe and we
don't see the results of an in game poll unless verant tells us. Brad
McQuaid said one of the few things which I kind of accept as factual
on this subject when he said that a very small percentage of their
players ever bother posting on the boards at all. 

You can bet your bottom that they got info from the ingame poll which
made it seem doable to them. Otherwise they'd probably never go out on
a limb to hire these extra people who will be sacked if this thing
fails.
