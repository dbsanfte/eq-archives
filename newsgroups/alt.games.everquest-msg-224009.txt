To be fair, the reason shamans are warned to do parts of the quest multiple
times are because of SOE's history of bugged faction with this quest.  It's
not an attempt to exploit, it's an attempt to overcome any possible problems
that might arise because of bugged faction.

What appears to have happened is that SOE has fixed the faction bugs and has
even gone a step further and adjusted the faction so that shaman epics can't
be MQ'd.  People who were heeding the warnings of shamans past to take
preventative measures against bugged faction instead ran afoul of this new
requirement.

There are many quests you can do over and over again to build faction.
Here's an example: there's a quest you can do in Shadowhaven to build
faction with the dwarves.  It involves running from SH to Paludial Caverns,
then on to Katta Castellum, back to PC, then back to SH.  Rather than do all
that running around, I simply chose to do the SH to PC part of the quest
over and over again.  Doing that, I was able to get amiable with the
dwarves.  Do you consider that an exploit?

Repeating quest fragments to build faction has been a time-honored tradition
that many many people have been doing for years... and this is the first
that I've heard of anyone calling it an exploit.
