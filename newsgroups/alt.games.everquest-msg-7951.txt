You've got it backwards.  The newsgroup comes first, then people start
asking questions, then the FAQ gets written.

Huh?  You seem to be confusing newsgroups with websites.  Once the newsgroup
is created, there is no more "work" involved.

Which "original FAQ"?  There is no FAQ on r.g.c.e.  The FAQ on the official
website is nigh unto useless, as its primary purpose is to market the game,
not answer the questions of the people playing it.
