A little less suspicious would be
LD
logon
loot
Hey I crashed.  Reinvite me pls.

Even there, it would be too likely that someone would see the looter in
action.  Now that I've given it more thought, I think it more likely that
the server ate the corpse.  I've never seen corpses (with loot) poof, but
have seen mobs poof on death (even xp mobs) so it's not that much of a
stretch.
