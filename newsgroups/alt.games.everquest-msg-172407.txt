This fortunately only applies to the Firiona Vie server. When it first 
came out, it applied to certain zones- but that has since been removed.

You can con (consider) a mob to determine your odds of winning. Green- 
it should be cakewalk and you won't get XP. Light blue, very easy but 
you'll get a small amount of XP. Dark blue, you'll have a challenge, and 
you'll get XP. Black or white (depending on background)- it's an even 
con and a serious challenge, and you'll get even more XP. Yellow, and 
it's one to three levels above you (depending on your level), an even 
tougher challenge and the odds are against you (and of course, the 
tougher the fight, the more XP you'll get). Red, and odds are very good 
your lunch money is going to be stolen (not literally) and you're going 
to be crying all the way back to your corpse.

If the mob cons green and you kill it, Trivial Loot Code (TLC) means 
that you will not get any magic or no drop items off that mob. You will 
instead get the message "That battle was trivial for you" which means 
something poofed. This is offset on Firiona Vie that the no drop flag is 
removed from most items (i think epics still have the flag), so you can 
buy something you'll need that's now trivial from lower level characters.

Also, on Firiona Vie, you can only have one character. And you can only 
speak your native tongue until you learn others- as there is no Common 
on that server. There's also alignment rules that I don't understand on 
that server if I remember correctly. So you can see that it's a 
complicated server to play on.

The PvP servers all end in Zek and each has different rules about who 
can kill who, but obviously, you aren't interested in that (much like me).
