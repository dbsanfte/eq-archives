OK, I was assuming with this that you were talking about your cleric
rather than your shaman. :-) Apologies...

For high 40s & low 50s (up to 52 or so I would guess) PoP is tough.
Very tough. As I play a cleric my groups never had a lack of healing
firepower and so we could pull as fast as we could kill (although for
some camps we had downtime for medding until I hit 54-55 or so.)

It's not quite true that PoP has made clerics essential for every group,
but it's darn close to the truth. Having somebody in the group who can
just completely heal somebody for a fixed mana cost isn't really an
option any more but a requirement. At 58 shamans and druids can start
doing this, but you're a long way from 58. I never saw a sub-58 shaman
or druid even try.

So if you lack a cleric, I agree PoP is probably too tough. Add a cleric
or a 58+ druid or shaman and the enormous amounts of damage being done
by MOBs starts to matter less - downtime is reduced or eliminated,
deaths likewise if the healer knows what they're doing. It might be
manageable with SHeal, but I suspect that unless you have a separate
healer keeping the tank alive is going to drain the healer's mana pool
if they only have SHeal or GHeal.

What it comes down to is that PoP introduced a need for the kind of
healing that clerics can do but which was previously only needed for
raids.

Speaking as someone with a cleric main, this has its upside and its
downside. The upside is that clerics are finally a useful class again
for exp groups. The downside is that in many ways clerics are an
*essential* class for exp groups, and that sort of exclusive requirement
is not healthy for the game. (Even if it means that I've seen the
end of LFG hell... going LFG for a solid week without a nibble
is very depressing, particularly for a class as poor at soloing as
clerics.)

And in terms of exp, it means that if you don't have a cleric and your
group is mainly low 50s or high 40s, you're probably better off
somewhere else - Sebilis, for example.

Of course, anybody who finds grouping in the low 50s without a cleric
easy, I'm sure Lance would appreciate your suggestions.
