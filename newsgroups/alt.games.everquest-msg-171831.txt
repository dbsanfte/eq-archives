A Brief Editorial:
(Or: Listen Up, All You Whipper-snappers out There!)

Why do people insist on using inappropriate or maybe just unnecessary
nicknames for certain classes and races? I mean, I can see where
paladin might be shortened to "pally" or warrior may come to be
referred to as "tank" - although "tank" could really refer to a few
different classes, so I think that particular nickname sacrifices
convenience for correctness. As far as barbarians go, the term "barb"
certainly offers some benefit.

Others just plain don't make any sense to me. For example, many refer
to wizards as "wizzies". Now, this nickname offers nothing but a
sillier sounding alternative to the correct term. Same number of
syllables, same number of letters to type. Additionally, referring to
dark elves as "inkies", though I suppose makes it shorter to type,
very much takes away from the fantasy environment I hope to find when
I log on.

There are other good examples, I'm sure, but I think I've given enough
to get my point across. Why is it that some people insist on trying to
wax cool, or MTV X-gen as I often consider it, in an established
environment with established protocols when neither would be
compatible by their very definitions?

This is not a place for "new wave" or "cutting edge" or even progress,
for that matter. It is a static environment that is not meant to be
influenced by or altered to accommodate any particular demographic,
"l337 d00dz" or otherwise. It is a specific genre of fantasy world to
be enjoyed as just that, and I endevor to enjoy it to its fullest and
continue to do so.

I do not base my opinion of people on first impressions as a rule. I
also can't really see something of no more import than continued use
of these silly terms as anything which would land you on my /ignore
list or anything so drastic. However, I take my characters seriously
enough to try to be the best < insert race/class here > I can be, and
I thoroughly enjoy the game as it is written. That said, call me a
wizzie or an inky and I must admit that your "Your standing with this
particular wizard or dark elf just got worse".

Rumble <--- firmly believes that many things can be most enjoyed
without changing a thing
