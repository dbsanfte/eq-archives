No.

The way that the nerf would work is that it would become level limited, most
likely to 50+ (this is the nerf that I'm wanting, as well as the fact that
there was something said about upping the regen on it at the same time as
making it level limited).

My druid is level 51, I want the tunic for my druid, level limit would have
no impact, and if they did up the regen if they limit level, then I'm even
happier.

And as for asking for nerfs, I'm not saying "WHEEE!!  NERF EVERYTHING!"; I'm
a druid, we don't get hit with the nerf bat, we get assraped with it.

Also, I think you mean to say that I'm getting something cheaper because it
is worth less, not worth-less (less value vs no value)

And I already understand that you are also childishly selfish in your desire
to keep the fungi in its current state in order that you get the use out of
it that you prefer (twink monk?), whereas I am selfish in a more adult
manner, by admitting my greed and being willing to offer refutations to your
baseless arguments.

Oh, and I give you 2 points, intrinsically stupid, and a liar.
