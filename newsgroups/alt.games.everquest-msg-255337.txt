All things that work fine with 10 or 20 fps as background fps, while still
using less cpu time.

Fair enough, but the fact remains that EQPN still allows for the former
without having to pay for it, and that's good enough for most people. All
you have to do now is find the sweet spot where you limit the FPS to the
point where EQ leaves enough cpu for you to do other things, while still
being responsive enough for things like autofollow.
