Interesting, Have not seen that perspective on Dell.  Ya, I agree
anything on board is a Big NO in my book when buying a home system.

I dont want an Onboard, NIC, Sound, Video,  nothing.   But its hard to
buy a PC these days without a onboard anything.

I work on the Support side in my IT department so get alot of hands
on.
We use Dell and Compaq.  And I wish they would take the compaq's out
and beat em like in the movie "Office Space".
