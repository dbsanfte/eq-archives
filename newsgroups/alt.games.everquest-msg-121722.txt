I recently logged in my 35 Shaman into Everquest (hadn't played him in
a while)-

Anyway- one of his items is a Platinum Armband...I notice it has some
sort of pulse effect - Preserve Mana or something?

Any idea what is going on? From what I've gathered doing a news
search- this was introduced at some point...

Just not sure what it means...do I use less mana when I cast now?

Thanks for any info :)
