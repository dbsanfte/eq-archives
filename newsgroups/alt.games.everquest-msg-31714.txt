Hmmm, let's see. In one case you break the rule and it results in the GM
giving you a new name. In the other case, you end up spending thousands of
dollars on lawyers and a potential jail sentance.

See what I am trying to get across here? What is the punishment for having a
chronically stupid name?

What a frigging bunch of drama queens. Get over it. Name change doesn't even
qualify as a slap on the wrist. It means nothing.

If his lame ass was taken out and caned you may have a point. In the absence
of any real consequences, your position is without merit.
