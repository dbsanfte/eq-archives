The Ti4200 128 is a great card (I have one). DON"T SPEND MORE THAN
$140.00150.00US for it.

The guy is a COMPLETE idiot. PC2700 is no different than PC2100 and it
IS standard. It is just rated to run stable at a higher front side bus
speed. If the system you are buying has a motherboard rated for PC2100
only (most likely the cheapest MB the shop can find), then putting in
PC2700 will be overkill. The RAM will be "underclocked". It will run
fine, but it will not be running at it's full potential. 

Personally I would RUN not walk out of that shop and  try your luck
somewhere else. Don't let impatience lead you into a mistake. PCs are
an investment. You don't want to buy problems.
