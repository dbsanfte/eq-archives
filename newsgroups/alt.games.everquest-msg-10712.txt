It depends on level.  Whenever Verant adds a new expansion, class
balance tends to change, and so the desired classes change.

The very high end game now, with Velious, makes Warriors, Rogues, Monks,
Rangers, and Clerics the classes in demand.  Should that influence you?
Probably not...if you were aiming to get into one of the top 5 or 10
guilds across all servers, you'd want to be level 58+ in one of those
classes.  But most of us won't ever be in such a guild...closest I'll
come is that I have a good RL friend in Legacy of Steel, so I can go
watch over his shoulder while they do things.

Also, someone starting now would be unwise to plan based on the current
high end Velious game, because the next expansion will be out by the
time they are likely to be anywhere near 58+.

I'd say play what is fun, and don't worry about whether the class is in
demand for groups.  For all but the highest end play, if you make
friends, you'll be able to get groups.  They might not necessarily be
*optimal* groups at various levels, but they will be viable.  For the
game most of us will see (even if we get to 60, since most of us won't
end up in an uberguild), the mobs will not be such that they can only be
defeated by a perfect set of groups, and having whatever class is
currently underbalanced present won't make the raid fail.
