   I have a LinkSys DSL router and the only info I put in was my isp info,
made sure my network neighbor hood TCP/IP properties where blank, and I was
all set, easy and quick. I've done nothing else and play EQ no prob. The
only problem I have is hosting internet games on my system and I can fix
that by going into DMZ on the LinkSys setup html menu and exposing my system
while I host.
   If you are having problems please describe in detail what they are...
