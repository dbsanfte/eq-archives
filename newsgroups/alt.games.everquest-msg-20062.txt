Ok, I admit I did have some fun. Just the blow of losing was overwhelming at
the moment. I'm sure I will keep playing, I really needed to vent and
hopefully get some tips on what I need to do next. I've had some time to
cool down, and rethink my strategy for my next character. I felt I may have
wasted practice points in my last characters on things like fishing and
crafts. After reading some of the other posts I'm getting a better feel of
what to do. Also, not knowing the lingo, and the commands didn't help the
matter. I just printed the list of cammands from http://www.eqanswers.com .

I would like to try a Rogue again, but it doesn't seem to be a very popular
choice. It's just what I am usually when I play RPG's. Any advice on how to
use one on EQ?
