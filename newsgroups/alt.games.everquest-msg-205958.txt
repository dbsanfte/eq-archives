No hoping involved, simple trial and error will teach you quickly what 
you need to do.

Wandering off leaving your character swimming can be perfectly safe, so 
long as you choose the right spot, and you look up far enough to not 
sink.  I have never trained my swimming that way, I do know people that 
have.  I did think the boats were fun, the first time.  The fun factor 
there wore out quickly.

I have had to swim very long distances where my stamina bar ran out, and 
never once experienced the sinking problem, never had to adjust to look 
up further.  I used to use the TD firepots, and once in a while was out 
of batwings, so had to swim the whole distance.
