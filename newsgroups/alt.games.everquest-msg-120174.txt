She has just as easily dismissed me. She is still making the same statements
without understanding anything about the game and the EQ community.  She has
not tried to educate herself at all.  One of her statements really offended
me.  Her son was betrayed by a friend in the game who stole some high-end
stuff that he had entruseted him with. She told him "you can't trust "those"
people".  Now I am one of "those" people and I am offended.  I would NEVER
do what this in-game "friend" did.  She is so obviously missing the point
that it is maddening.  He was probably not as upset over losing the stuff as
he was at being betrayed by a friend.  That hurts! But you know I didn't
betray him or hurt him in any way and I am offended that she would easily
dismiss me and all the other wonderful, kind, honest, considerate,
concientious, caring people that I have met in the game.

Yeah and maybe if she had spent as much time and effort helping him BEFORE
he killed himself as she is doing now he might still be alive.  Maybe if she
had taken 5 minutes to get to know why he enjoys EQ so much instead of
dismissing it as a silly game she might have been able to relate to him.
Maybe she could have spent a little time playing the game herself and then
she would have known what was going on in his world.  Or maybe if she didn't
show so much contempt for the game, he could have come to her to talk about
his in-game problem and she could have been there to help him work things
out.

I have attempted to ignore this woman, but everywhere I look her stupid
statements keep popping up.  She is attacking the EQ community and that
includes me and I am offended.  She is still spouting the same ingorant
uneducated assumptions she has made about the game.  How many people take 45
minutes to find a place to camp?  How many people would say that finding a
safe spot to camp is one of the things that makes the game addictive?  It
has been over six months since her sons death and in that time this woman
has still not figured out that she is wrong in some of her concepts of the
game.  It is obvious that she doesn't want to know the truth and it is sad
that she can still find an ear for her distorted perspective after all this
time.
