I'm sorry if this is not a solution, but I hope it helps anyway. I come
from a heavy FPS background, and at the beginning, having to hold down
the mouse button to look around used to drive me crazy.

However, after a few weeks of play, I finally realized that for long
runs, having "autorun" on and steering with the keys is the most relaxed
thing, because you can let go of the mouse altogether, which is to be
appreciated when you are running across West Karana. And when you press
the button again, you go into full quake mode, with the "turn" keys
becoming "strafe" keys. 

Take my word for it, the EQ control interface is a work of genius, and
it really works wonders for the actual control requirements of the game
(think about it... How often do you use mouselook to *look* around, as
opposed to just steering?). I would really recommend you become used to
it, rather than trying to change it, and soon you'll realize how much
sense it makes. Just map the "autorun" key close to your standard
movement keys, and it will make your life really much easier.
