I am looking to visit hate over the next two weeks in hopes of getting
a mage epic drop for my hubby (57 mage atm) and a ranger drop for my
sister (60 ranger atm). I am 3 aas away from dire charm and hope to
get them before we head for hate this weekend.

What I want to know is what mobs in hate can be dire charmed?

We are planning on a group of
57 mage (hubby)
60 druid (me)
60 ranger (sis)
62 Cleric (friend)
56 enchanter (friend)
and another tank hoping a 65 pally friend will be on. 

But a dire charmed pet would make kills go faster.

Anyone know what can be d.c. (by a druid) in hate?
