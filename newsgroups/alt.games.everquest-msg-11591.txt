It seems slow.  But according to other's research, it is SOC.  I might road
race it against a druid sometime, and check for sure.

Since I can go exterior view, and be bound sight while sitting, I assume
that I can use EOZ while sitting.

    My point was, and is... he claimed Verant said that they did not intend
EOZ for scouting... so if not scouting, what did they intend?
    Yes, its short duration and aggro abilities, limit its effectiveness as
a scouting tool.  But it's a fast, movable, controlable eye probe by design.
What ELSE could they possibly have thought that that is useful for?
Everything in its designed effect IS scouting.
    If not a scout, then what?
