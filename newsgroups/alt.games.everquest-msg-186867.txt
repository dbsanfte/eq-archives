Well you can do Seafuries in OOT, they don't always drop much   plat
but they do drop gems from  time to time that sale to merchants for up
to 100pp a pop.

You can also farm wisps in Erudin's Crossing isle.
Thats more suited to druids or wizards tho, they can bind there and
port to NK and turn in the lightstones. That doesn't make a lot of
money, only about 8pp per stone but its  easy and steady/
