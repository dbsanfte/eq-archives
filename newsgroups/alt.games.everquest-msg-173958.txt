    What, am I the only one that is having this problem, or did I KF
everyone that has been talking about this.

Well here goes.  I log on and after selecting the server it goes to the load
screen.  when that finishes it kick's back to windows for about 3 - 5
seconds and then bulls up a solid black screen.  The music is playing as if
I was in char select, but there Is nothing on screen.  The only way for me
to get out is to do a three finger solute and doan end program.   IS there
something I am missing here.  Worked fine before this last patch.  Have
spent the last 3 hours trying to find info on this.  I am about to download
the XP compatibility program so that the windows mode will work ( if I can
ever get there ).

Here is the info for the system that I can't get to work.

P3 1G ( set to default  usualy at 1125)
640 meg's ram
GF 4 Ti4600  (also set to default  normaly at   315, 744, 4xAA, 4xAS)
XP - home
2X80gig raid

Hope you all cam help.  I am starting to get fed up with the instability
after patches.  Arnt patches suposed to patch problems?

Thanks

Omiin
