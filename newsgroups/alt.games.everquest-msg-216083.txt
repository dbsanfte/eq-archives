rofl, i have played with pulers so idiotic that i have a spamkey that 
yells.gsays ans says NO MANA 25 times. Complain to me that you didnt see 
me gsay no mana,  hold the pull please=) I also have NO PULLING, OUT OF 
MANA hotkeys that repeats it in english, french german and spanish. 4 
times each language. IF the puller doesnt stop pulling at a politely and 
calmly said one in gsay 2 times, the 3d time i spam the heck out of the 
group and the area.  I originated the hotkeys when doing pick up groups 
in dreadlands. I would get into a pickup group of euros most of which 
didnt speak english. [i also keep french spanish and german dictionaries 
handy, and am able to muddle by in spanish and german  and speak a 
reasonable amount of french.]

I did get the reputation of keeping my groups alive through everythiing 
except that damned ikky monk wandering past. I still will get invited 
into groups because of my reputation as a cleric with good mana control 
and an understanding of how to learn the damage/heal patterns of my 
group members. Ask any healer....you can stay at 30% mana if you know 
exactly when to pop a celestial, or a remedy, or when you can let him 
drop to under 40 and do a CH. It is simple mana control. It also helps 
if you understand how much mana you get from 1 hit of a mod rod, and 
just when to mod yourself. I frequently will go into a grouping with a 
kei and 1 mod rod...and that 1 rod has kept things from being a total 
wipe by letting me pop a heal on the MT or even a pet at just the right 
time.
