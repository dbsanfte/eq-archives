It's not class based, it's race based, there are 9 gifts total, Gifts of the
Elves, Gifts of Man, and Gifts of the Halflings.  Basically all the races
that can be druids, excluding those cultureless half breeds of course.  (For
the humor impaired, that was a joke).  Three gifts from each of the three
races.  www.eqtraders.com has a decent writeup of the quest.
