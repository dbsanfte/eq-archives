What is there to inform? There have been 4 instances in the past 2
weeks of massive player drops. The fault hasn't been directly on their
computers. It's been somewhere up the line. No, they don't know
exactly where the problem was...just that there was a large drop.

The problem comes when every time Joe happens to go LD, and, by
coincidence, Dan does as well, they decide that it's VI's fault and
can't possibly be their system/ISP/region. It's the mentality the
whiners seem to hold that VI are a bunch incompetent morons...
