Kinda makes you wonder how people ever got around to those far away
zones unless they grouped with a Druid or Wizard a lot.  I started
post-Luclin so it wasn't all that bad.  But wow, if you wanted to get
a camp in Sebilis when you had camped the previous night in
Lavastorm...without a porter and without even spires to save you a
little time.

I hate boats.
