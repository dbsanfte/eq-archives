No; for gameplay purposes. Half the challenge is learning the 8 spells you
might need at any given moment and foregoing the others.

I would like to see the pet as a member of my "group".

My forage button is 'attack off, sit off, forage, attack on'. But they could
just as easily make the button grey-out to tell you you can't do it. It's
also quite annoying that if you forage while sitting, you can't re-attempt
it a second later after standing up, you have to wait the whole re-pop time.

Gameplay; part of the fun again.

Gameplay. There has to be a downside...
