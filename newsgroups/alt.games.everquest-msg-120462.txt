Something which occurred to me regarding wizard DD efficiency (perhaps
all caster DD, but I was thinking of wizards in particular)...

The problem we have at the moment is that wizards are great at doing a
ton of damage in a very short time, but weaker than most meleers at
*sustained* damage output.  Same with other casters, but other casters
have useful abilities beyond nuking, which wizards lack (porting aside).

To raise the sustained damage output of a wizard to be comparabale to
(say) a monk, you'd need to boost the mana/damage ratio of their nukes
significantly.  However, that would make them soloing gods: imagine a
class with monk-like damage output who virtually never needs to heal
(snared & rooted mobs don't get to hit you much).  So...

Give wizard nukes a bonus while grouped: the larger the group, the
bigger the bonus.  This could either be more damage or less mana per
cast, or perhaps even a bit of both.  The exact bonus would need a fair
bit of investigation: the intent being to make the sustained DPS of a
wizard somewhere in the region of a (averagely equipped) monk.  (Maybe
a bit better, maybe a bit worse).

This way, you get a more group-friendly class while leaving the solo
ability exactly as it stands now.
