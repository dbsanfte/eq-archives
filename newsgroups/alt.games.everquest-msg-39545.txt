And why did you have to camp for so long?

Because Verant want to have rare and prestigious items, instead of
everyone having exactly the same gear. That's a fundamental of the game,
not gonna change anymore than football is going to change to not being a
game played between two teams. 

Now, if you have a desirable item on a mob that is trivial for someone
to kill, then the only way to make it difficult to get is to make it
rare. Given (some) players tendency to camp for obscenely long amounts
of time ( I once tried camping an item, but gave up after half an hour.
No idea how or why people put up with that kind of BS), then the item is
only going to remain valuable if it only drops once every ultra-obscene
amount of time.

Compare other stuff, such as planar armour, the drops off Derakor the
Vindicator, WW dragons, CoM reavers etc. Those drop good loot really
commonly (several pieces every time in the case of Vind, and he's on a 4
hour spawn, so is essentially always up). There the difficulty is
actually getting the people together to kill the target.
So they don't need to be rare drops to stay valuable.

So if TCC had been in place, the fungus mutant could have been a tougher
than normal for its level spawn that required a good group, or multiple
groups, to kill. And it could have been on a 2 hour timer, with no place
holder (so it is always up when you arrive), and dropped the item every
time.

The bottom line is that the lack of TCC in the game is what forced you
to spend that time camping. Maybe you think everyone new buying the game
should be forced to suffer like you did. I don't.
