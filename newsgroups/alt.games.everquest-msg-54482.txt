Lot of great advise given here so far.  I'd like to offer a suggestion just
based on observation.

Runnyeye has some items you could consider, and your Primary could easily
pick up solo.  The zone is rarely utilized by the levels that can get XP
from it (at least on Druzzil Ro...YMMV), and the 3rd and 4th floor seem to
be dominated by soloists AKA farmers.
Sporestrand Shield:  Caster usable 5 AC  +2 INT/WIS +25 Mana.  From Sporali
Black Alloy Medallion:  6 AC +5 INT/WIS.  From named goblins
Dark Muslin Armor:  no stats, but beats Damask and Gossamer for AC.  from
4th floor goblin spellcasters

You could also bugger Lord Pickclaw for a Black Alloy Coif, which is good
resist gear for a warrior (8 ac +6 STR +6 all resists) and if you can
convince the Moldmaster to cough up his haste gloves, so much the better :)
