Aha, there we go, I thought it was mobs over level 50, and its over 54 
instead.  That would explain why the lower tier planes suck... and your 
observation that the goblin/mephit caves were still viable for exp 
because -they- are that high level matches my cleric's experience, the 
only real exp he could get prior to getting his POV flag was in limited 
areas like that.

I'll just have to level a little more to start seeing this...

...or talk people into hunting mephit meats.
