*ding* *ding* *ding*.  Remember this line, we'll come back
to it later.

Kurn's is a dungeon.  Verant has already stated that
there is now a higher ZEM (Zone Experience Modifier) for
pre-30 characters in dungeons.

Because now you're getting the new dungeon ZEM bonus.


>Now, Virginia, there *is* a dumbed down game. 

No, all you've proven is what we already knew:  "Yes,
Virginia, there is a post-patch dungeon bonus".

And encouraging people to dungeon-dive is not a "dumbed down
game".  What was "dumbed down" before was outdoor zones
that gave people almost the same ZEM as dungeons, which
left players fat and stupid after 45 levels of outdoor
exp grinding.

Now that people will be enticed to actually go into dungeons
because the reward now matches the greater risk inside
the dungeons, people will start to actually *learn*
how to pull properly, fight efficiently, and deal with
the sorts of situations that will "smarten them up" about
how to properly play their class.  That's the *opposite*
of dumbing down.
