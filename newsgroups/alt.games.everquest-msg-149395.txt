Recently I've been seeing severe (multiple second) lag occur somewhat
randomly on HP updates (mine and mobs) and, of all things, /assist.
The worst I've had happen was that my target switched to the player who
had agro'd an HG <after> I had hit the HG a couple times and it started
following me (about 4 or 5 seconds after hitting /assist).  On my server
what seems to work best when hunting HGs is to be aggressive but polite,
admit your mistakes and try to correct them, and just leave if there're
too damned many people there.  Oh, and if there're a couple Bards being
parasites, multi-kiting across the top of the hill to get as many HGs
as they can and not bothering to kill PHs (anything that isn't a guard
or part of the hasten cycle is a PH), one sometimes successful solution
is to stop killing PHs for a while so that you can rapidly kill off 30
or more PHs, hopefully triggerring way too many HGs for the Bards to
handle (not as hard as you might think, the best Bards appear to have
no need to go to Rathe Mtns for cash loot, and an unexpected stun
seems to be pretty rough on the "prettybard" wannabes *eg*).
