Huh, I could swear I remembered it being lore...  The memory is 
admittedly nearly two years old though, so perhaps (a) Verant fixed it or 
(b) I'm prematurely senile. :) I actually ended up whacking orc 2 for 
faction night before last, but only saw the scroll drop in the brief time 
I was there.  Doubt my Ikkie Monkie would have much luck ever doing this 
quest though. :)
