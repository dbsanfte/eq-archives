    Not me (thank goodness), but two I've seen. One person went LD on an
Efreeti raid, didn't come back until after everyone was gone. He almost made
it out, too - warriors have a LOT of HPs. The other person went LD in Hate
in Maestro's room, and wasn't able to get back to the game until after Hate
was upgraded. Took him a month to find a time when he could log in and drink
his Gate potion to escape.
