True enough, but consider this -- if it's possible to race through
content trivially, playes will "see it all", get bored, and leave. 

There's also some very worrying comments about PVP from the WoW
designers. One said, on the message boards, he sees no need for any
system to prevent high-level players from ganking newbies, since "if
they don't get any benefit from it, why would they do it?". This
demonstrates an ignorance of griefer psychology that you'd think
Blizzard -- well known for attracting the dregs of the online
community -- should not have. 

The boards are currently full of whiners screaming "Nerf this!" and
"My character is too weak!". Blizzard is discovering what they should
have known from the beginning -- a game cannot balance PVP and PVE. If
PVP is the intended endgame, then, the majority of gamers who are
non-PVP will leave. If PVE is the endgame, balancing for PVP will
destroy that. If Blizzard expects to have a satisfying PVE and PVP
endgame, I wish them luck.
