I agree wholeheartedly with you.  And no, I'm not gonna stop playing like
everybody seems to imply.  The changes they make certainly devalue all the
effort that an established character has exerted.  For instance, remove
the hell levels then a large amount of time spent getting thru all the
hell levels is all for naught.  Newer characters will have an easier ride
getting to where I am now.  Being lvl 60 is something that not everyone
should be able to do.  Sorry but that's my opinion.  The game would get
awful boring if everybody had a lvl 60.
