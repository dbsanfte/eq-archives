Another reason why they will want to do it... it will allow people to run 2
accounts on the one machine, and many people will subscibe to a second
account. I may have done this myself, had it been a couple of years ago, but
at this late stage in eq's life im not paying for character transfers to
other accounts. Maybe if they give me a free transfer, but im still
disinclined to play catchup on those with 2+ pc's and have beeen using it to
full advantage for the last 3 years.
