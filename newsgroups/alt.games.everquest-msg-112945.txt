So how would you define risk for a pre level 10 character?

I'm not entirely convinced based on my experience that this method is
actually faster.  Regardless of that, pre level 10, you are never at risk.
You cannot lose xp, you cannot lose equipment.  The only risk you run is
taking longer to level.

As I see it, if one is an exploit, so is the other.  Both reasons for
getting yourself killed are being used solely to save yourself some time.  I
don't honestly see either one as an exploit.

Before the changes, they were not quite as much of a joke as they are now.
