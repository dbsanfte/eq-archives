Good day-

I love sopping up the A Jus that is the AGE forums.

I'm up to lvl 26- maxed my hid-sneak-backstab skills.  For the life of
me I cannot get a consistent sneak attack.  I have the pause set at 30
which gives me about a 4 sec delay it seems- but it only works once in
a blue moon- and even then it's hardly anything to brag about.

Am I missinging something here.  I have the Fabled Dragon Dirk it
think its 11/21 or something.

How do you have your macro set- or am I just begining to understand
the nerf that is the rogue.

Armin
