I wasn't talking about the approximation.  I was talking about the 5% chance
when a mob hits their spawn point of them remembering anyway.  Doesn't
exist, never has.  In *every* instance where a mob actually makes it back to
their spawn point, they forget you, guaranteed.  There's a lot of side
issues that make this not always appear to be so, but once you understand
the side issues you realize that there really *are* absolutes in this game,
because it is a programming creation that plays by absolute rules.

Another aggro mob that hasn't made it back to its spawn point passes aggro
along, the mob is scripted (i.e., Vindi's "pets"), the mob simply can't make
it back to its spawn point (poor design, this buggy condition exists far
more than it should), etc., are the reasons why a mob might appear to have a
chance of remembering you after it has gotten back to its spawn point, but
once you recognize those conditions it's easy to see what actually happens.

Hell, for all we know that's exactly what the GM was talking about (GMs
aren't known for being the most astute, and are even less known for caring
enough to pay attention to what is actually being told to them).
