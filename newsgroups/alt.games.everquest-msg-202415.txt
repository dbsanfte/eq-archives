Let's see where, now.  And what old world zones will we not be able to use
any longer (because we WERE level appropriate for the zone) because of the
high-level invasion.

/yawn.  I had my spell books organized and could get to anything with ease.
This is for the lazy caster or the Ebayer that does not know the
organization of the char's book he just bought.

This is good.  Again, though, for someone that isn't organized it's a major
boon.  For me, I won't need to remember each spell set.

This is nice.  I've seen it on test and it really helps with the less used
spells (What does Dance of the Fireflies do, again? Oh, yeah, that's why i
never use it).

WTF?  I quit!  I NEED KEI TO PLAY!  Err, um, oh yeah, uh, this is a good
thing.  That's it.  That's the story and I'm sticking to it.  Oh, and I
logged all my toons in last night for KEI before the patch, hahahahaha and
nya nya nya to those that didn't (do I win for this one, Jim?)

Finally.  Er, wait, Conglaciation is one of the spells I don't have.  I'll
have to see if I can get it for less than 10K, now.

That should stop the /shout Thanks for the heal, whoever did it!  Now it
will be /shout Thanks for the heal Nice_Cleric_138!

This could be pretty good.  No more Siphon Life for 75hps, could it be Drain
Spirit (223 hp) or, Heaven forebid, Drain Soul (338hp) that my pet taps for?

Damn.  I didn't know.  No wonder it was so hard to conserve mana.  I needed
to be drunk.

Is this an optional patch zone or included?

Nice.  No more What's Fungal Dung for?  Now we will know if it's vendor
trash or something to throw on the Bazaar mule.
