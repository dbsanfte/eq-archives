This is something I expected ... but it can be workable if i get 10 lvls per
PL session, then stop for spell skill incs

On the server I am on frequently ... most dont have time for any newbie,
they arlready expect me to know my class in a grouping session ... I hae
shouted hundreds of times for groups: 50% of the time, i get asked to leave
because a more experienced player is available, and they dont have to time
to 'hold my hand' as they put it.  the other 50% of the time, no one is
looking for group members, so I am stuck soloing ... I started with a
warrior and quickly got discouraged at all the negative comments.  Next went
to an enchanter, that lasted to about 24th lvl ... I didn;t have thousands
of platinum to have a 255int, and KEI *always* ... then tried a cleric, grew
bored of sitting around and staring at the screen for umpteen battles n a
row.

So, solo classes seems to be the only method for me to get into the higher
levels, magicians are fun, necros are fun, the druid is fun but i hate the
under 20th lvl period ;) And my roommate has a 65 shaman on another server,
he suggested I try them, but I got to 27th lvl, and couldn't solo anything
at all :(

It is hard to find away to learn to group with any character when alot of
people will overlook you because your new to grouping ...

PS - I happen to be a fan of the dark side. Someone has to root for the bad
guys =)

thank for the info tho :)
