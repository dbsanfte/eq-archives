   I wasn't trying to judge you really, just that statement.  Like I
said, we all misspeak sometimes.  I certainly do.  Heck, if you stood by
that first post, then while I would still question it, I wouldn't
necessarily be condemning you.  I probably hold some goofball ideas that
other people would take issue with, and that's fine.  We don't all have
to think a like to be good people.

   Or something the random name generator might spit out.  Hmmm indeed. 
That would make a fine name for an alt.  Hmmm...  thanks for the idea!
