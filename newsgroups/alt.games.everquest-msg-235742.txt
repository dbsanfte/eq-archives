	Well, not really :-)  I'll almost always heal people if I notice 
they're hurt, but as someone else pointed out you do have to be careful
about faction and heal aggro.  I only buff people if I feel like it :-)
or they ask nicely AND I have mana and reagents to spare.  However, I
always rez when asked and never charge except for the time I had to run
all the way to Nurga and sneak past all the dumb badgers and goblins to
get to the corpse :-)

	As a cleric just put up LFG either /lfg and/or the LFG tool.  I
never wait more than a few minutes for (several!) invitations :-)  Quite
a change from my poor lonely druid :-)  Don't worry about messing up either.
Frankly, as a young cleric if you just watch health bars and get heals off
you'll be fine.  Since you wont be trying to time cheals your biggest
challenge will probably be dealing with heal aggro.  When you do pull aggro
resist the temptation to run around.  Just stand still until they get it
back or you have to hit DB :-)

	That being said don't be afraid to get in and melee or nuke!  Just
remember that your primary job is healing and dont get distracted or run 
yourself OOM.

>How long would I be expected to commit to a group? 

	I try to mentally commit to 2 hours per.  If I only have 45 minutes
or whatever I ask: "Is 45 minutes enough of a commitment?".  I've never
had anyone say "Well gee if you cant' play for 4 hours we'll just get
another cleric" :-)

>Is there usually an agreed playing time or goal that is set?

	OTOH if you join a raid or epic quest party you should expect 
a more open ended commitment.  ("HOW many black reavers do we have to kill??")
