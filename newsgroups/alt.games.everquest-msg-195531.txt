Prices I've seen on Karana recently are much lower (I've pretty much
abandoned Tunare server and Kaev, anybody want his stuff?), FV and Test
I won't compare because they have weird economies.

Ok, let's see if I can make my point without it coming off as an
"it's no fair!" whine...  The problem isn't that melees are too
weak, they are plenty strong, even way too strong in the case of
some twinks as you point out.  The problem isn't that the casters
are stronger than the melees, that has pretty much always been true
for most of the character population.  The problem is that casters
with KEI are not only functionally independent of melees (which is
bad) but are actually hindered in their progress when they group
with melees, which is just plain stupid.  I never realized just how
independent casters were until I started playing a Druid.  My Druid
has easily attainable gear for his server and has never had KEI, and
yet his ability to acquire xp and loot solo far exceeds what any of
my various melee characters have ever been able to do grouped.  With
KEI all casters gain this independence, and Druids become just plain
ridiculous.  With currently available gear and KEI a Cleric, the
ultimate dependent-on-a-group caster could easily solo to 50, and
laugh at the languishing melees while he's at it.  It's this loss
of interdependency, combined with the absurdity of those groups that
do exist rejecting Enchanters (because they all have KEI) as well as
any caster who hasn't gone and begged or bought a KEI.  And I watch
these groups playing ever so badly in their wonderful gear and not
paying any sort of penalty for this bad play, they crush the mobs
in spite of their idiocy, it hurts to watch.  So you're right, it
isn't <just> KEI, but imo KEI is by a substantial margin the worst
of it.

I already typed too much about that above.

It happens, we'll just have to try to keep it from becoming a habit.
