For so many years I admired Chomsky's academic accomplishments and
expertise and still do admire that part of who he is, BUT if we have
not reached an UNDERSTANDING by now it is doubtful that we ever will. 
Explain and explain, cry over and over that there has been
injustice--it won't wash......injustice is a fact of life.  The day
has come for all to put away the incantation of "poor us, we have been
treated badly by(...choose the group.) The Israelis have been accused
of doing that and see the reaction to that.

Chomsky has to also stop these appeals; all intelligent people have to
stop expecting that others will empathize with their cause if they do
not make a  gesture to solve their own problems in socially and
politically appropriate ways.  What is the pay-off of his actions? 
More and different prestige?  MONEY?? A sort of altruism that seems
misdirected? Building of his reputation for *good*??

(We) know there have been injustices, but choices were made that did
not get the outcomex that were desired.  No one is "entitled" to
choose to expect others to do what needs to be done for them. Tantrums
that reach such outlandish proportions simply will not be tolerated. 
The "borrowing" of words from persons who have fine reputations like
Chomsky lowers the esteem of those who participate in this activity.
