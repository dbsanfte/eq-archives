I thought it was pretty fucking funny.

But the analogy was there, some of us got it, perhaps you should lighten up?

Maybe because this isn't EQ Online for the Playstation?   Maybe the players
for EQ online adventures want to have the ability for new expansions and
content too eh?

It's quite different these days.  Back in the old days the game was new and
Allakazams, Casters Realm, and of course EQAtlas did not exist for people to
get quick map cheat sheets prior to roaming.   So what you are asking now is
redundant.  Cause I guarantee as a noob to the game, and I knew of EQAtlas I
would be going tthere to print out my very own map.

You know what?, Verant or SOE does NOT REQUIRE you to use the books or buy
POP, interesting huh?  Want to make that great trip like the good ole days,
while keepiing the "I want it now" people happy.  DONT USE IT!!!, It's
really very simple man.
