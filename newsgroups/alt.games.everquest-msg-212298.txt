Not at all. Even faith can be examined for rationality or consistency. 
In the final analysis matters of faith cannot be proved or disproved but 
   through examination you will face the consequences of your faith, and 
you may be forced to revise it.

For example:

Suppose I held by faith that the sky is a nice bright iridescent green.

Naturally you would tell me to take another look up, and so doing I see 
blue. Now I have two options, abandon my faith in bright green skies, or 
abandon my (previously unexamined and assumed) faith in the colour 
accuracy of my eyes.

Thereupon I make that choice, and by examination resolve the consistency 
of my faith.

Someone who has examined his faith can beleive in green skies and bad 
eyes, or blue skies and good eyes, but not good eyes and green skies.
