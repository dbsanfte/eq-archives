Blood Reaver, yes.  He's a Dragon.  If you run smack into Gore or
Wuoshi without a couple groups purposefully set to hunt them,
there's a good chance you are dead at 60, too.

I've been slammed around by Blood Reaver a number of times now,
both as a 52 cleric and a 26 Druid, death is not inevitable, you just
need to be alert and have an exit plan.  Druid keeps a number of
crap buffs up with SOW near the end of the list, so it doesn't
get dispelled.  Cleric keeps TBoots in slot two (symbol effect
strength in slot one) because he -can- put it back fast, and it
protects his more important buffs.  He also (again) curses the fact
that he hasn't got JBoots.

Other than that one mob (and another who is much harder, but
doesn't wander around) the high end mobs in the zone are around
level 40, its very similar to Dreadlands in degree of difficulty,
 but far better in terms of reward.
