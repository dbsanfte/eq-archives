I'd go for mana/HP/AC myself. I know other people have a taste for resists
but I consider resists to be mainly situational. No matter what you are
fighting, mana and HP have a use, resists _may_ not.
My immediate recommendation would be to bump WIS further and drop your 6wis
rings asap in favour of Jaded Velium Rings (ac5 30hp 30mana).
