I had EQ Classic installed. Modified the eqclient.ini file to change
that horridly hard-to-read blue to a lighter color. (I don't know WHAT
they were thinking. That color is not readable in full screen.)
Well, I installed the expansion today and it's back to that awful
blue.
I looked in the eqclient file and the code is NOT there. It is still
the purple code, but the color showing is blue  0,0,128 !
Did the expansion put the colors in some other file?
I'm gonna go blind trying to read this thing.

Any ideas, clues, helpful ideas appreciated.


Mandari, Druid
