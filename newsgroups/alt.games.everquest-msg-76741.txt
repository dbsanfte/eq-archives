In GD you could solo the Tizmak without too much problem the down side is
once you become KOS to them you will not be able to go AFK in GD. The Dwarf
Guards will not kill the Tizmak and they do have a tendancy to wander
around. Usually the Dwarf Guards will keep the area clear of Giants and
Kodiaks but will not do a thing agains the Tizmak.
