True enough. But even then; telling them a task is a solo quest system 
is immiedately going to open the can of worms I just did. You can't tell 
a newbie there is a solo quest system from level 5 to 65... and expect 
them to say... "oh, ok, thanks". And then go backing chasing spiderlings 
and batlings around... they're going to want to know more. Its not like 
the AA system which can be summarized as a series of unlockable 
abilities that you can start earning at 51st level. Newbies are far 
enough from 51st level that they can well afford to wait for more info.

I dunno. That's far too generic to be helpful. Are 'those people' 
newbies who don't know how to play? Or does 'those people' include 
expert players who still considered it outright impossible even heavily 
twinked to kill the 10 tightly packed highly social reds as a soloer, 
regardless of timeframe. If the faq is aimed at newbies then the 
assessment of the task system should be from a point of view where you 
don't have 200k worth of gear and a 65th druid on autofollow, of course.

I think a more helpful answer: "Most soloers cannot complete many of the 
tasks assigned at various levels because they are too difficuolt.  Maybe 
try a task if you are looking for a change of pace, but don't expect it 
to be completable on your own unless you are an expert playing a strong 
soloing class." (Hell *I* don't know enough about the task system to say 
anything really helpful about it ;) I wish someone *would*.)

Plus you say 'when they first added in sep04 some people felt they were 
too difficult... '... well what about NOW!? As interesting as OoW 
release trivia is I want to know about tasks NOW :) (granted its still 
SEP04... but that will pass...)

Its almost required. Things like lxp, aaxp, tasks, tribute, ldon points, 
pop flag progression, etc each could require mini-faqs.

Or just post the URL in your sig; and save every one the spam ;)

I think one area the FAQ is weak on is targeting its audience and its 
knowledge base. Is it a FAQ for eq noobs on how to play EQ? Is it a FAQ 
for usenet newbies on how to post on usenet (a.g.e)? Is it a FAQ for the 
established player who wants to start writing hotkey macros? Is it a FAQ 
for advanced technical tweaks... video card settings, alt-tab support in 
XP, etc... 

Its all good info... it just doesn't all belong in the same place... 
imho.

There should be some more separation.
