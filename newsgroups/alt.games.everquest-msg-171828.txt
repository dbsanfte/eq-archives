Wouldn't that criteria involve doing a certain percentage of the
damage to the mobs? What would be the minimum required amount be?
One-sixth? One-twelfth? The fact that they *do* provide evac and the
virtual elimination of running mobs and other things a mob does when
he gets to low hp should affect this requirement as well, shouldn't
it?

I have played a wizard (Why do people call them "wizzie", btw? Same
number of syllables as the correct term, yet it sounds more silly.
Bah, editorial comment withdrawn for another thread.) and I have
played alongside wizards. I see them as the ultimate mob de-buffer.
With a wizard in your group, you know all mobs you fight will have a
substantial amount less hp than were there no wizard in the group,
because you merely need to beat them down to that final nuke point
(with the wizard's helping in addition), and then poof - the fight is
over.

The only people I could possibly see who have any basis for excluding
wizards would be the extremist number crunchers, and only then because
they are dealing only with the raw numbers, not everything else that
is brought to the table. My only reservation is with substantially
lower level wizard compared to the rest of the group. Mobs resisting
all the wizard's spells is a real downer.
