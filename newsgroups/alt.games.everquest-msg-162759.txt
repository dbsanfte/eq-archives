Yeah, I understand the laws of probabilities and such. However, I made
four trips from the component vendor to the forge - each time carrying
all the components I could cram into all my packs - and *every* trip
back to sell the completed product I carried fewer than half the
number of bits that were possible for me to have made. I was in my
mid-20s when I started.

That just seems to be out of whack is all.
