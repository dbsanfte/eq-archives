Well, I am no expert but I did a WebFerret search and came up with this site
http://energycrisis.lbl.gov/ it shows the situation dynamically and, if you
follow the link under Forced and Planned outages to "here" you can then look
at an archive of relevant (I assume) data for the period that you are
interested in.

Hope that helps.
