Side tracking a little here, but one of the best reasons to "invest" in a
KEI is for tradeskilling. Forget the mana regen for a bit and look at the
increase in WIS/INT. If you are not at (or close to) 255 WIS/INT while
practicing tradeskills you are throwing plat away. This weekend happily
donated 50 plat for KEI on my Gnome Rogue (Can get Tinkering, Poison Making,
and one other tradeskill to 250 without any AA). +Int items for a Gnome
Rogue are much more expensive. Even with KEI he's only at 247 Int. Anyone
know of a good pair of pants with +Int that a Gnome Rogue can wear???

Of course as a Rouge he needs all that mana to cast all those l33t Uber
buffs :)
