replace a warrior with a paladin . The paladin can stun on incomming
allowing slow to be cast sooner and completely mitigating the unslowed
dammage most of the time. They tank 80% as well as a warrior so in total
take less dammage while being a main tank then a warrior does on anything
but an uber mob.

Necros are very nice and i certainly dont mind them taking a dps slot.
However if i have a choice of a dps necro and a dps (ranger,rogue, or
beastlord ) i will always take one of the latter ones .

A druids major contribution remains dammage (sub par ) , snare , healing,
evac. There are just to many other classes that do these and do them better.
Beastlords can slow well enough to make shamans less usefull then they used
to be. Paragon is also better than quiescence for bad overpulls.

Rangers are extreme dps. They have snare . They are aslo the best trackers
in the game. The ability of snare is always underappreciated.

Monks are decent dps and that is all they are. About 8 other classes are
decent dps and have so much more to offer in other abilities. Monks remain
screwed .
