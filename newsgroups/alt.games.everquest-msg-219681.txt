Out of curiosity (brought about mainly by this thread <g>) I pulled
out my 48 ranger last night. Grouped with 2 friends that also pulled
out lower lvl alts (53 cleric and 50 shaman) and headed to PoD. I
figured that would be a good test of ranger tanking ability (or shaman
slowing ability, depending on how you want to look at it). I did die
once when slow wore off at a really bad time with a red con that hit
for 260 but overall I was surprised at how well I tanked (ranger has
mainly been a solo character up to now). Admittedly, I was trying to
only pull the flies which are under 50th lvl and only hit for about
170 max. Our trio wouldn't have done nearly as well if we'd been
killing the mobs that hit for 250+ on a regular basis. 

I'm not sure if he'd be considered a serious twink or not, only item I
ever bought him worth more than a few hundred plat is a toland's
bracer. All the rest is hand-me-downs, junk I've picked up or gifts
from friends. He's at 900ac and 1800 hitpoints unbuffed. 

After the cleric left, the shaman and I went to Dulak to try and get
the drop for his stoicism quest. I tracked down a drunked pirate in
the middle of the zone, harmony pulled him out of the building,
invised and ran him to a safe spot where we killed him and looted the
quest piece. ... was a fun trip, I think I could get used to life as a
ranger <g>. 

Rgds, Frank
