Have you tried selling Gem studded chains?  Each one is a guaranteed
Celestial Robe at some point, as the Celestial Robe combine returns the
chain on a failure.  Costs 250ishpp per attempt.  I see them priced at 2kpp
in the bazaar, but that seems high, given that I also see the Robes priced
at 2kpp.  Even selling it at 1kpp, would be a nice profit.  I would not try
them until getting close to 250 skill though.
