This is just a problem with Drinal, they should sort it out soon. I noticed
when I was in Marr earlier, Synthan is standing near the coast in the north
part of the zone. Someone must have aggroed her and tried to run away. I was
planning to petition, but I was busy at the time, and plain forgot. They
should reset her soon - I'm surprised that GM never got back to you about
it.
I know shopkeepers won't serve when they're off their spot - how about quest
NPCs? Can you still hand in items for quests? If so, then it'll just take a
little more wandering around to get rid of the GLSs.

Good luck,
Rich
