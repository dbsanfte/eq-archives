I've started playing a Hafling Druid on the Bristlebane server.  I've made
it to level 5 finally but I am having a hell of a time raising money to get
my spells.  Does anyone have a tips on what or where to hunt near Misty
Thicket.  Or if someone is feeling generous maybe drop me a Plat or two?  Or
maybe even a guild that helps out some. TIA as usual

Silent B
