I've been playing the game for 3 years, but not a whole lot.. Just a bit =
here and there, maybe just once or twice a week.

After all this time, I have a Ranger up to level 41.

Most of the good stuff I was given (SSoY, Wurmslayer), or some higher =
ups helped me get (Ivy Etched Tunic, Silver Plated Leggins).

But even though I get some pretty nice stuff, I'm still wearing some of =
the first pieces of armor I got around level 5, such as Barbed =
Armplates.

So I'm asking for some freebies! :)

I'll take any Ivy Etched pieces you might feel like donating (I already =
have the tunic and two bracers), plus any weapons better than what I =
have (Ykesha, Wurmslayer).. Even a 2HS or 2HB weapon would be nice =
because my skill sucks in that.
