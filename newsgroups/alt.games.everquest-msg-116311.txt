Thank you everyone who replied to my question about using Gflux/CoH
to get a group to sky level, today I called a small raid up to sky,
we killed the reaver and he dropped a Jade Reaver for us :)  We
killed Neh too, but just an ORS and the Key of Torsis.

After our raid was cancelled Wed for lack of a rogue, we took
a single group to CoM to try and get in position to CoH a force
to sky.  After a bit of trial and error (ok, nasty trials and 
much error :) I was able to get on top of the building with the
locked door on the sky level.  I bound myself there, and then
succored out to the zone.

Today it took almost no time to get 14 folks up there, kill the
roamers on the bridge, kill the mobs in the house under us, then
pull from the last house into ours to take the mobs in the reaver
house.

Some things we learned -
First, it's easier to Gflux to the house in the CY, and run
from there with SoE/invis to the ramp, which avoids aggroing
stuff in the building at the bottom of the ramp.

Second, pull the roaming goos off the ramp from the CY, that
way the mage can CoH the party with plenty of time.

Third - the house at the top of the ramp is chock full of baddies,
you need to be able to clear it in 20min to avoid repops and 
head through.  No problem for a strong group, but we were 
understrength for this.  If it hadn't been for the fortuitous
circumstance of my buddy training the house away when I was too
far away to aggro, so I was able to head across and run around
it wiithout problem, we might not have succeeded yesterday.

Next, you gflux the mage onto the house with the locked door, 
allowing you to not only bypass the door, but it's a spot where
nothing aggros.  This is where I bound myself, and where I CoH
the raid to.

Truly we were a little overpowered for the reaver, with 14 people
50-55, but you can hardly say no to all the rangers and druids
who want to go :)  Or all the guildies who just want to help out,
for that matter.

On a side note, referencing the loot-whore thread.  The druid 
who won the roll found out how much effort our little group had
put out to get there, and chose to give up the JR to be rolled 
among the 2 rangers and 1 druid who were in that group.  It's 
times like those when you realize how lucky you are to be guilded
with good people :)  My RL buddy who gave me the item I traded
for my CoH, Mod Rod 2, and Phantasmal Protection spell (about 15k
or more worth of drop spells, at the prices I saw in the market
channel) won the second roll.  Karma in action :)

Makes those 4 deaths he suffered (2 unrezzed) to make it happen
worthwhile :)
  
Just a bit of a positive story - I'm feeling pretty good about myself
at the moment
