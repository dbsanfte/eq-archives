Take this as you will, but I wonder just how many people will wish to
come here to find such easy targets. Point being, the ng as you knew it
is gone. Even some off the old ones will likely come back now. Some of
you might consider moving on. Some say even Boss, Arlo, and even
Reptilian have notice to this place.
Now I only speak as one of those that was attacked upon entering this
ng. I did however warn of this. It's not like some people could not quit
professing their nerdhood so the place might calm down. I fear the old
timers will be outnumbered soon. It's not exactly a winnable situation.
