I wish I had your dilemas to deal with.  Can't offer any useful insights 
I'm afraid.  Guild I am in still does randoms among those that can and will 
use a drop.

I will say, I do understand their position re warriors, although, to be 
honest, our best equipped warrior has little trouble holding agro unless 
someone who can is actively trying to take it from him.  I can slow a mob 
on incoming, and rarely get hit even once with him tanking.  In a raid 
situation, I can slow early enough that there are no issues with him 
dropping, and I don't get agro.
