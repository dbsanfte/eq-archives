The AA XP is earned the same rate regardless of the level you're on.
It is much easier to gind group when you're level 80 and a good puller
but solo, it'd be harder to find decent AA Xp solo at level 80 than at
level 70.

I'd stick with AA XP until all damage migtation is done so you won't
bleed so much against harder mobs.

For XPing, I would suggest the middle area of GE, they are light blue
to 70 but very easy to handle
