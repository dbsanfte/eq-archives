Only one is correct when using the proper percentages given on
websites and in game - the monk's point.

I understand that you are continuing to miss the entire point.

That's because *they are the same*. See the math.

Yes, it would. Learn some more math please.

No, they won't, because those variables affect both measurements
exactly the same. It's not complicated at all.

It has been known to happen. When you actually use the proper
equations to prove me wrong, I will admit it. While you try to prove
your case through faulty math, though, don't hold your breath.
