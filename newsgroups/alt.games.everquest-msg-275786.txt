You can switch between the old system and the new one by selecting the
User Interface tab on the Options window. Under the Name and Chat
Bubble heading, you can toggle the NPC Evaluation drop-down between
Simple (new system) and Detailed (old system). It's not exactly the
old system, instead of solo/group it will say <blank>/Heroic. 

<blank> is to show that there is nothing under the name when it is a
solo mob.
