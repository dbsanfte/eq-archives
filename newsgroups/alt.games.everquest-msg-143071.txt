Heh, I already did.  But your arrow innovation is a fine idea.  If I can 
find a good way to incorporate it into my style, I will feel morally 
obliged to do so. :) Just think of it as borrowing a snippet of your .xml 
to improve my custom interface. :)

Mmm... top posting, posting in HTML, posting to whine about the GMs 
disagreeing with you, posting about what a lousy game EQ is and how we all 
have no lives and should quit, posting merely to disagree with or insult 
another poster without providing any evidence to back up your point...

Really, the occasional self-deprecating remark barely even registers on 
the Patheticometer.  Especially when it is so thoroughly outweighed by the 
vast numbers of ways in which you regulary demonstrate non-patheticosity.

---> Recently involved in a thousand-plus post multigroup flamewar about 
muppets... That alone should out-pathetic you by a good long ways. :)
