Ok, from what I have been told, and from what my personal tests confirmed,
here is the skinny on the swiftblade:

When it first came out the effect was a PROC that lasted a few minutes, and
effected both hands. The effect from all tests I saw seemed to vary with the
level of the user.

After VI saw how powerful this made this relatively easy to get item, it
was, of course!!! nerfed. Now its NOT a proc, its a full time effect. The
haste still seems to vary with the level of the weilder, giving a lvl 50
player around 35% haste. Rumor is at 60 the haste is near 70%, but that
didnt seem to be the case on my tests. The reason may be this tho...HERE'S
THE CATCH: the haste now only seems to effect the hand the weapon is in. I
cant confirm this 100% to be true, but it WOULD explain the wildly varying
test results on parsing I have both seen and experienced when using this
weapon. IMO test it for yourself, but from what I have seen the item, while
decent, isnt worth the money people are charging.
