I cant answer directly.  It does seem that all tradeskills require lots of
time and/or money to see a return.
However, I seem to make the most cash farming items for tradeskills.
Velium.   I hit Crystal Caverns with KEI...stay till KEI runs out, or, the
other farmers irk me....and I seem to be able to make between 2 and 4k in a
session.  Ill even strike deals with tradeskill people, just to unload the
stuff...25% off the going rate, etc.  I cant keep it in my inventory for to
long.
When I get bored killing miners....off I go to kill the crystal spiders for
their silk....that sells fast as well.
Perhaps there is other ways of making the pp in tradeskills....Im out to
make a few pp, and have fun too.
