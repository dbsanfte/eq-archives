The problem you're running into is that you are combining "spiderling
silk" if you are getting threads and bandages. You must combine "spider
silk" (which will come off the large and giant spiders, among others,
but not spiderlings, except in the Feerrott) in order to get silk
swatches. (Two silks per swatch, never fails, trivials around sixteen or
so.) These swatches, when combined with patterns, produce raw silk
armor. And by all means visit the link quoted above and print out the
guide. It will cover all these questions.
