Fortunately, I am in a guild with both a lvl 53 and 46 (working hard at 49)
cleric.  So I have someone who will help me, quite often unasked actually
too.  Last time my warrior died, the 46 cleric came over and revived
(whichever one it is) me, I certainly didn't ask, or expect it.  At that
level it really just doesn't take very long to earn the xp back.
