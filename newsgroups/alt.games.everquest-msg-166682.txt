My thoughts on the subject:
there is just a simple *gentlemens* agreement concerning camps and should be
respected as such as long as someone is not being greedy. Being greedy is a
nasty part of the game there has been many an occasion i have gone to othmir
in CS and saw one or more camps complete with warriors etc and started to
kill them to the sounds of "<insert name of camp here> is camped". now in my
opinion you can only take a camp if you are there waiting for it to pop to
use your dervs example you cannot possibly be at all the camps and therefore
cannot claim them.
