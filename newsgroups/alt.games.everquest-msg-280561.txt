Sure,but I am 67,as you could see in my posting.
For now there is only one place which makes me scream for mana and
where I wouldnt dream of meleeing,thats Tipt.
Last group I had there was War,Rng,Rng,Mag,Enc,Cle(me).One of the
Rangers and the Mage did not have the flag.Group decided to let the
War tank and use the charmed pet only for dps.In the average I throw
a HoT(480mana) and a Complete Heal(400 mana) per fight on the War.
This wouldnt have been too bad by itself,but constant early charm
breaks forced me to throw a lot of fast heals,I was constantly around
20m or 30m until the first trap spot,where we could recover after
clearing it,made me feel pretty uncomfortable the whole time.
Sadly we wiped at the 1st gate,partially my fault,puller brought 2 of
the undead(?) arisen Beludus,and instead of pressing the hotkey
for Heal over Time I tried to open the bazaar window(in vain).  =)
In the end we wiped because Fast Heals generated too much aggro,
I died with 50 mana left.
At least we got the FT2/Regen2 aug from the named,and some nice
AA xp from the expedition.
