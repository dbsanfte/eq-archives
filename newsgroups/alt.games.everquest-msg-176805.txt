Grrrr, I hate following myself up - it's the Usenet equivalent of
lighting your own farts.

Anyhoo, checked the bank on Test earlier today with the default UI
loaded, and the new bank slots have not appeared yet.  Been lots of
interesting looking files coming down from the patch server, though.
Also tried to look for Charm items (as if there'd be any yet, doh!),
but the word "Charm" does not appear in any of the combo boxes.  So it
looks like the odd change coming through due to patches to XML code,
but little else.
