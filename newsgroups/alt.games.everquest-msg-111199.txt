    A buddy once noticed his dwarf rogue looked like one of the Gunthak
Pirate models in Firiona Vie, so he got some Fine Steel Rapiers like they
have equipped and walked back and forth on the bridge out of town. Every so
often he'd stop, say "Arrr, I be a pirate," and dance a jig. He scared lots
of people, and some of them even thought he was an NPC!
