I've been lurking here on A.G.E for a while, and only post occasionally - so
occasionally that none of you probably know me. Anyway, I've been wondering,
are there any good free news servers? I use AOL (horrible POS) to view NGs, and
I hate it. I read a thread about good newsreaders, and downloaded a few, but I
can't find a good free server. The only ones I can seem to find are the "ACCESS
TO ALL NEWSGROUPS INCLUDING ADULT BINARIES! NO RESTRICTIONS! ONLY $10 MONTHLY"
type, and the type that local ISPs provide their users. Can anyone help me? I
really don't want to use AOL. 
Thanks
