I didn't mean to imply that twisting was as simple as pressing 1 2 3.

Its 1 (start song) wait for song to complete casting (man that casting
bar makes this soooo much easier than my first bard)

2 (clicking any song stops singing old song) and very quickly (but not
tooooo quickly) 2 again to start casting second song

Now wait for 2 to complete casting

3 3 stop singing 2 start cast 3

1 1

2 2

etc.

At the same time you need to be watching for an interrupt, which
will stop your cast midway thru.  Now you start your next song
(or restart your current one) with a single click rather than two;
double clicking will start and immediately stop cast!  But since the
interrupt may have been a stun, it may take several clicks before
you actually start, since you can't start while stunned.

A good rule of thumb is to just keep your song rotation up, ignoring
resists and interrupts, but there are circumstances where sticking
one song is more important than getting the rest of the rotation in,
Snare comes to mind as a priority in some circumstances.

Most songs last 3 tics and take 1 tic to cast, which is where the
triple twist comes in.  The mana song line is one exception, it
works on a "pulse" basis, instant effect on the tic.  This allows
you to stack multiple bards, since there is no "buff" icon up
which other bards will bounce off, but it also means a twist
with mana one in three will put out a third the mana flow that
singing mana constantly will.  A frequent downtime twist
is Hymn (heal) mana, wait two tics, Hymn. This keeps HP
regen up continuously and provides 2/3rd your maximum mana
output.
