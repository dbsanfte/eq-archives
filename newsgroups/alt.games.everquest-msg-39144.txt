Excellent - that's the rational reaction.  When you're done, stop
playing and move on.  If you're really adult about it, you don't even
need to post a rant about how evil Verant is for only giving you 2000
hours of enjoyable playtime (I'm estimating low here).

Most of the unhappiness I've seen in the higher-level game has come from
people no longer enjoying the game but not being able to admit it.
