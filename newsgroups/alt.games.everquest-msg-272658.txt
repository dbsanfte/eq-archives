I'm not sure how different the classes are, but the EQ2 classes are generally
divided by alignment.  Templar spells do not match up with Inquisitor spells.

Because in a situation where one of everything is the best, you do not have
real diversity.  You get situations such as Everquest's "Holy Trinity".  Where
90% of the groups are Warrior / Cleric / Enchanter +3.  (During PoP Knight /
Cleric / Enchanter +3)  If one class has a real substantial advantage, then
that will be the one tank class, and the others may as well not even exist for
the most part.   Their players will be few in numbers, and those who do
continue to play that class will be rarely seen or asked for in groups.

For a truly diverse game, the tank classes must be equally good, although they
should all play significantly differently, both playing as that class, and for
the people grouping with that class.  The healing classes must be equal and
interchangeable, requiring only adjustments to play style and tactics.  Same
with crowd control and dps.
