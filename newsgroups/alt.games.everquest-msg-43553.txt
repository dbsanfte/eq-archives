Dstep my friend I have bad news for you.

In DAoC the #1 complaint is the running to places.

It is SLOW. It is TEDIOUS. There may be bind stones in most villages
but that is offset by many hunting spots being a long ways from those
villages, and no bind stones in the frontier at ALL (which is good,
actually, for RvR reasons).

To sum up - travel is THE worst problem in DAoC and it will *not* be
changed in release.
