> Osama Bin Ladin was found hanged by two CNN journalists early Wedensday
evening.  As evidence they took several photos, some of which i have
included here.  As yet, this information has not hit the headlines due to
Bush wanting confirmation of his identity but the journalists have released
some early photos over the internet..
