   I've thought for a while (but don't recall if I've posted it) that EQ Live is
sorta a testing ground for some of the reported features of EQII.  The main
example of this is the instanced dungeons of LDoN, but I also think the new
combat systems and spell effects might be in this category as well.  In a sense,
if I'm right in any way, all of us who are actively playing are already in the
EQII beta.
