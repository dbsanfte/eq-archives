After moving from 24 to 26 in Warsliks (thanks Tukka), I have a feeling that
the giants will start playing out at 27.  Already the Greenwoods yield less
than half a blue per kill, and I rarely see Evergreens that are even con or
better.  The Forest Loop is great, but three levels of soloing giants has
yielded just the one (this morning), with a few Legchoppers and Hammers of
Smashing thrown in for good measure.

I'd really hate to get on the SK gnoll treadmill unless I have to, and would
like to see new places.  Which leads me to the question ... is there any
place on Velious that would be safe for a lvl 27 druid to solo, or should I
wait on those lvl 29 spells?  All advice/suggestions are appreciated. :-)

Thanks!
Crash
