I have a dark sense of humour... so a lot of people find what I deem
humourous to be offensive. As a solution, I put that tag (<Joking>) next to
lines that may be unduly cruel.

Some people like sexual jokes, while I find them tasteless and rude. On the
other hand, I laugh when people die horribly in movies or games. As you can
imagine, Braveheart, Saving Private Ryan, and The Patriot are hilarious to
me for all of the wrong reasons.

Besides, my joke is amusing because it's true... to me, at least.
