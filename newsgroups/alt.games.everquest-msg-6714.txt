My only trip to the overthere was at lvl 14 when I foolishly thought I could
make the solo run to FoB and Kurns tower.  I made to WW, scaring myself so badly
that I turned tail and went back to Oasis.  I handn't really considered going
back, but it sounds intriguing.  I have no experience there. Whereabouts is this
"ledge" and "corner" in the zone? And what would I be fighting there?

I was definitely considering CT after interesting tidbits were posted to our
guild boards about it.  (We're doing a raid there soon.)  But how is it for
pickup groups? I heard that it's usually pretty empty.
