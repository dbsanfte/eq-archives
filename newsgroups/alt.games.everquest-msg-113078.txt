The deep is a very fun place, but it is also a very hard place.  The shrooms
are the easiest things there, and believe me they are not the same as thier
gimpy fungus grove brothers.   They hit for 220 when they stop trying to slow
you and actually take a swing. The razorbeasts are even harder, same damage
potential and a faster swing rate.   The underbulks hit hard as well, and have
super AC.  Expect a lot of 12 and 1 damage hits.  The respawn time is very
fast, in the neighborhood of 10 to 12 minutes.   You need to keep moving once
you're inside, or get nailed with repops.    You can't really pick and choose
what mobs you fight... it's tightly packed and you're constantly breaking the
next area you want to move to.   Half of the spots spawn a random type, half
are set to certain ones.

We like to wander a bit, but for risk / reward, camping the Deranged Underbulk
is a pretty good deal, especially if you don't have the crowd control to
easily wander.  From the zone in, go right at the first turn, and left at the
next.   He spawns in the dead end maybe 25% of the time.  At least until we
finish outfitting the guild with the no-component Levitate and that
disgustingly good paladin / sk cloak / shield.

If you make it down to the bridge, beware, all is not as it seems.

Happy hunting : )
