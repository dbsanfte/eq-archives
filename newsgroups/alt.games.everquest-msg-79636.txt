Nothing I know of pre-velious either.  But there's more than the ring wars.

Kromriff military leggings (Fergul doesn't drop leggings until he respawns
in the quest)
Cloak of Truth (Arbogast and Miller don't drop parts for the cloak until
they go to the bank and come back out with weapons drawn)
Coldain Military Wristguard (the dwarf doesn't drop the bracer until you do
the quest and the BM attacks)
Part of the quests in Acrylia Caverns/ Grimling forest where you can't
target the grimling high priest in AC until you've put someone on the
"sacrifice" platform and tripped the trap, then killed a few dozen waves of
the skeletons. (well, not quite the same but similar)

And due to the fact that in all these instances, when they re-load loot,
they also respawn (if you're targeting one of the NPCs, you lose it and have
to reacquire target), yes, loot is loaded on spawn not death, other evidence
is that decaying skeletons drop weapons that they wield, and Shardwurms that
glow drop the glowing bile.
