I was hoping you'd follow up to my post, since I've been

Eh, I couldn't move in any direction... The wizard lev'd me, tried
to Force Shock me out, I tried sitting, ducking, jumping... Nothing.
I fit in there like a cork. For some reason there were 10 GMs on,
though, so the wait was short ;)

Yuck! We only had one on us, and the SK handled it before he fell
to meet his death amidst the alligators.

Hell yeah, I really want some of those potions! But I thought they
were lore? If not, I'll fill my bank account with them! And sure
it's easier if the Avatar is down, however, nobody ever goes to
CT anymore, so if he's up, he stays up...

Yup, that's where we went first, but didn't find any crusaders at
all. Oh well, we'll luck out sooner or later...

Yeah, I guess that's the smartest way to start out in there. It's
not exactly as forgiving a dungeon as Cazic is...

(Rune takes notes) I have an idea, I'll go to CoM at 40, then move
to LGuk at 45 for the frenzy camp!

Hehe, avoiding morons is a large incentive for doing dungeon groups.

Well, lucky for us, a friend's bard is catching up to us! We'll
see what happens when we add him to the mix.

Rune, appreciates all the info gathered in this thread
