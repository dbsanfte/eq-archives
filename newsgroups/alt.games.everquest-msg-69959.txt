I've seen Luclin run on a P4-1.5, 512, Raedon 8500 card at 1600x1200. Looks
ok to me. I used to run EQ also at 1600x1200 on my GF3-ti-500 and all the
addons worked just fine, never installed Luclin 'tho.
For the people who don't want to go with a new system you should probably
bypass Ti-500's and Raedons. Later model GF2's should be good with 64 mem.
The GF3 Ti-200 is a good choice aswell for it's price.

512Ram is sufficient...above it shouldn't improve SOL all that much. Your
bottle-neck is your system 1st, 2nd is video card. A newer RAMBUS system
would really speed things up, but do you want to spend the money for it?
