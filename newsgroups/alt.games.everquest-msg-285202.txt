*** Highlights ***

- The way that AA experience is granted within each con range has been 
adjusted. NPCs that are higher level within the con range will now give 
more AA experience than NPCs that are lower level, but con the same.
- In order for Sony Online Entertainment to provide you with the best 
possible customer service we will be integrating a new SOE Customer 
Service interface into EverQuest which will allow us to provide you with 
a Unified Front of customer support where all forms of service will have 
the same general look and feel in a centralized location. You'll also be 
able to view support and service requests in an archived history 
regardless of how you contacted us or what game you contacted us about! 
For more information on this change please read the announcement in "The 
Town Crier" on the EverQuest forums at http://eqforums.station.sony.com.


*** Items ***

- Warweaver has been corrected to be a Paladin / Shadowknight only 
weapon. Players who looted the item before the patch have had the item 
exchanged for a different weapon: Warsorrow.
- The damage ratios of several high-end TSS weapons have been retuned.
- The Cartographer's Loadstone has been modified so that stat increases 
are better spread over the quest's progression. The final stats are now 
achieved at the final step of the quest instead of the preceding step.


*** Tradeskills ***

- The recipe names for some of the poisons that use sketches have been 
made clearer.
- Some poison-making components have had their stack sizes adjusted.
- Fixed a misspelling in the title of Brodder's Lost Diaries.
- Enabled Fierce Heraldic for a more appropriate expansion on the 
progression servers.
- Crow in North Qeynos has decided to use the same supplier as the ones 
in Abysmal Sea and now has a full stock of his brew.
- Smith Gyasi in Crescent Reach should now properly get more supplies 
when you offer him a completed ore shipment.
- Halima and Baker Kosey now carry a supply of beans.
- Rylin Coil will now give players any missing Tinkering Mastery books 
if they have already completed the task.


*** Events ***

- The Muramite Proving Ground trials will properly flag everyone 
currently in the zone when a raid is successfully completed.
- The Stitch event should now spawn properly after the ambush event is 
completed.
- The Cursebearers in Inktu`ta should no longer warp shortly after spawning.


*** Quests ***

- Many of the Ashengate faction quests should take less time to complete.
- Fixed the combine for the Flowers for Veldyn task.
- Shryyn's Quest "A Fair Trade" is now repeatable. Since this is now 
repeatable the experience given upon completion has been reduced. 
Additionally the quest item is now lore.


*** Raids ***

- Made some fixes to the King Odeen raid in Valdeholm. He will take a 
little longer to escape and will give warnings if you have almost given 
him enough time to escape. When he does escape the mission will fail 
outright. Also corrected some errors with the Commander Clanghor (his 
assistants won't run off without him) and with the High Keepers. You 
will now have to defeat them before moving on to the next part of the 
event and their ability to heal has been removed.


*** NPCs***

- The inhabitants of Frostcrypt will be more likely to see invisible 
individuals than they did previously.
- Reduced the level of Expin in Greater Faydark so he can be 
successfully pick pocketed again.
- Mesa Snakes have a bit less poison than they used to have, though the 
effectiveness of the poison is the same.
- Librarian Hemfar in Crescent Reach should now be willing to offer you 
the charm reward for turning in artifacts. If you did not receive the 
offered reward, hail him again.
- The swarm pet from the Savage Platinum Fists now functions correctly.


*** AAs ***

- Corrected the description of Mercy Kill so it properly reflects that 
it works on NPCs below levels 66, 68, and 70.
- Adjusted the way that AA experience is granted within each con range. 
NPCs that are higher level within the con range will now give more AA 
experience than NPCs that are lower level, but con the same.
