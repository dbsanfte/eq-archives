I'd probably port someone for plat, as long as I wasn't occupied with
something else myself, too.

Anyhow, on a wider note, let us not forget here that biz's original
post merely pointed out the sheer laziness of the guy who asked for a
port merely to avoid a short run through safe turf.  A bit like the
guy on my server who was asking for a port from PoK to Lavastorm -
when the zone started laughing at him after his 3rd or 4th appeal, he
got huffy and said he just wanted to save himself the bother of the
run.  THAT's the kind of laziness bizbee was illustrating.

Rudeness was not mentioned by biz, nor any of the other baggage
attached retroactively to the post by everyone else.
