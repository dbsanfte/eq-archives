See, there's the problem *I* have with most swearing today.  It's the
mind-numbing banality.

I mean really, dork?  Couldn't you at the very least come up with, for
instance, "you chancre-coated feculent offspring of a toad"?

To me, the use of "fuck", "asshole", et cetera simply show an abysmal
lack of knowledge of the English language.

Which would you find more insulting, Drake, to be called an asshole,
or to be called a vomitous mass of sputum, with all the charm of a
gangrenous goat?

As for the original poster's complaint, I agree, there's too much
swearing, but even more, it's BORING swearing.
