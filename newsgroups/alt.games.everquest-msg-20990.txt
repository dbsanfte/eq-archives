Combining it into something stupid and having nothing to do with the world
of Norrath is against rules.  So, in MY mind I think your names violate
(simply because I don't "get" it) but I'd be shocked if you were made to
change it...I'd be shocked if someone petitioned you, even.

Catdog would violate,
Wardog would not.
