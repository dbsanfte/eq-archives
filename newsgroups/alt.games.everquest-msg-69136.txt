	They have a poor CR ability because THEY ARE NOT IN THE ZONE WITH THE
FRICKING CORPSE!  The bind rules THEMSELVES impede a fighter's corpse recovery
ability!

	I was out soloing in the Grey again today.  (Harder, but doable.)  Had I
died I would have had to run through Fungus, Twilight and Scarlet, and THEN
actually recover the corpse.  Had the 58 Druid or 60 Shaman out there died,
they would have had their corpses back in five minutes or less.  (I haven't
heard about Luclin having warped bind rules...if it does then the example
doesn't hold but the principle does under standard bind rules.)  A Monk would
not have a pleasant time doing this, crossing all those zones with no SoW, no
Lev, no invis.

	Take all of the difficulty you are ascribing to casters, and multiply by
the number of hostile zones between the fighter and his corpse.
