I contend that letting the market prices settle on pure supply and 
demand will ensure that items don't rot, and prices don't inflate.

You mentioned that the solitary mage who can outbid the other int 
casters because the market for "mage only items" is depressed so he 
automatically wins them at minimal expenditure, allowing him to build up 
  reserve rp against others in casters for multi-class drops.

This is a legitimate flaw of the pure market model.

One possible solution to that would be to institute two separate rp 
pools. a 'my class only pool', and a 'multi-class pool', and give one rp 
to each pool per raid.

One advantage to this is that it ensures that under-represented classes 
  do not get to build reserve rp to bid on multi-class items.

One disadvantage to this is that it simply dilutes the problem a bit, 
but doesn't eliminate it. If you have less monks and beastlords then 
warrior and rangers they'll still spend less multi-class rp on mnk/bst 
items than warr/rangers will spend on warr/rng items... and when an 
all/all drops the monks and beastlords will have more reserve rp.

This is a flaw of your system as well, btw, not just my proposed 
solution, and in fact exposes a fundamental imbalance of any sort of 
market system. The class system with restricted no drop items 
fundamentally creates a different market for each class and under 
represented classes will inevitably have an opportunity to accumulate 
more wealth.

Which leads me to consider queue based systems...
something along the lines of 'for every 20 raids' (or 10 or whatever) 
your name gets added to the queue. When an item drops, option to pick 
the item goes to each person in the queue in order, the person who 
selects it is removed from the queue.

People can be in the queue more than once. People in the queue more than 
once may only accept on their first entry. (To ensure the queue cycles).

People who raid often will cycle through the queue quite regularly. 
People who raid rarely will cycle through the queue more infrequently.

There are no rules about who can loot what. Period. Although peer 
pressure will keep abuse in check. If you want to have mains, first then 
alts that's fine by me.

Number of advantages: No points means no market issues. Person at the 
top of the queue gets first dibs. Very fair.

Several problems:
1) Initial Seeding the queue might be an issue... maybe not.. depending 
on how you handle number 2.
2) Handling the situation where nobody in the queue wants it (or nobody 
is in the queue, but several raid attendees not in the queue do want 
it...ranking them on their status towards earning a queue entry x/20 and 
resetting them to zero? both might work.
3) Queue management itself is no more work than rp totals management, 
but actually manually running through the queue to allocate loot could 
be tedious. (But I can think of several ways to alleviate it.)
4) Determining the number of raids required to get a queue entry is a 
bit arbitrary. You basically want to manage the queue length so that it 
is fairly stable in size.... hmmm... that sort of solves itself:

make the number of raids required to get a queue entry a function of the 
queue length, but fix it so that once you start working on a raid that 
total is fixed. (ie if you've got 3 out of 5 and somebody leaves the 
queue and the new computation is 7 raids, you still have 3/5 but the 
other guy is not 0/7.)

Something along the lines of raid_attendance/#gooditemsdroppedperraid. 
Say 50 people per raid & 5 items suggests you need 10 raids (call them 
10 raid points) to get into the queue. (Essentially 5 people will exit 
the queue each raid, so you want 'on average' 5 people to add to the 
queue each raid.)

It handles the economy problem quite neatly. The only 'unfair' effect is 
that the lone mage will still get all the mage drops, while the 6 
warriors will end up essentially rotating loot. The reality is that if 
there is only one mage and 6 warriors "The guild is going to uber equip 
that mage long before the warriors are all done. That's just a fact of 
life". But the good news is that the mage won't be accumulating rp to 
outbid others simply because his item economy is depressed.

Hmmm I pretty much made this mess up on the fly. I hereby submit it for 
criticism :)  I already concede its probably a little over-complicated 
to manage vis-a-vis traditional rp systems, but I contend that its more 
fair because it resolves the problem of 'a different market for each 
class allows some classes to accumulate wealth for broad-class items 
faster than others'

Anyways, as a mental exercise it amused me :) so it wasn't a total waste.

Simpler systems adapt better. :)

One comment you made was that bidding is between mains, apps/alts. But 
if the magician is bidding "to sell" on a mage-use droppable item then a 
warrior is free to bid against him. If the mage doesn't disclose that 
he's bidding to sell there is no way, except by 'loot council' for the 
warrior to challenge whether or not the mage is planning to use the item.

Further, your comments about peer pressure, while very much on the mark 
are inadequate. Many many people have an alt or friend the guild doesn't 
know about, enabling them to "covertly" sell the item.
