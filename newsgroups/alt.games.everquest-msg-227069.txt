If you're a tunnel rat, yes.     (I suppose thats bazaar rat these days.)

Killing a mob and getting an item that you will actually use is fun.   It's
a rare and special moment, that happens all too frequently in EQ.   Turning
every drop into the equivalent of vendor trash would make it a much poorer
game.


I'd much rather kill Vanikki and take a Willsapper off his still warm
corpse, and use it to kill the next creature and the next one and the next
after that, rather than looting some caster robe, setting up a vendor and
waiting for it to sell at an outragouesly high price, then waiting around
for someone caster to sell the same weapon to me at an equally outrageous
price.    Thats just not the kind of game I want to play.  (1)




(1) Yes, I'm aware Willsapper is no drop.  Feel free to substitute the
droppable weapon of your choice and the appropriate mob, the example does
not change.
