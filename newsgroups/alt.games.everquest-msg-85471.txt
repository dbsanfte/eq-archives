Every continent should be rearranged in such a way that every zone has mobs
3 levels higher than the last one.
They should all be in a row, starting with starting cities and ending up in
planes.

There should be no mob level mixing in any zone, i.e. no level 35 mobs in
the level 10-12 zone. All mobs should be stationary and have an aggro range
of 1 foot. No mob should be close enough to another mob to call for help at
any time. There can be no such thing as trains or wanderers.

No mob should ever run away, nor should they chase you when you run away.
They should not be able to heal at all, and they should stop attacking you
if your health gets below 50%.

Experience for every kill should be multiplied by 100. All mobs in every
zone should drop the best rare loot that can be had in that zone, and an
equivalent amount of plat too.

Helper NPC's should be spaced evenly along all zone walls so you can get a
free heal and buffs at any time.

Wouldn't the game be so much more fun if those were the rules?
