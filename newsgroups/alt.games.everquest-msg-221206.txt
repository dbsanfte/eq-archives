Actually I have seen people bitch about various different ones of those 
points as well.  Not as often I will admit, but people do bitch about it.  
They are all examples of how SoE has made the game far easier, including 
the various things done for newbies.  Personally, I don't like the game 
as much now as I did before they started turning the game the direction 
it is headed now.
