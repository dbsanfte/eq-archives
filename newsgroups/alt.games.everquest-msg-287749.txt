Indeed, though I don't usually find that's an issue.  If the group is
getting that large, chances are the new PC being added will more than
make up for the lost merc.  It did become an issue once when a party
member was bugged (or perhaps just confused); his merc had died or
something and even after waiting out the timer he couldn't "revive"
the merc, and unless the merc is active you can't dismiss it, so the
dead merc was taking up a party slot.

Usually, though, I'm happy to just take any comparable-level PC and not
bother with the merc as long as I have 3+ to activate leadership skills.
Last time I was killing worgs and wereorcs in Loping Plains, which I can
do with just cleric+monk but it's a lot easier adding the merc tank, I
had a guildie come along with a second high 70s cleric, and that was
enough that I just ran my basic two-box plus his cleric, no mercs, and
we did at least as well as two-box plus merc tank.  (He mostly went into
his "battle cleric" stance, with Vow of Victory and so on.)

Different point about mercs: last night I think I figured out how to keep
them from running off when the party is split up.  As mentioned earlier in
this thread, your merc won't follow you if you're tagged as Puller for the
group.  Instead, it sticks near someone else in the party.  I've seen my
merc go haring off across most of a zone to follow someone who was turning
in an update on a task, rather than staying near my cleric as the monk
goes off to pull.  I *think* what's happening is, at the moment I get
tagged as Puller, my merc looks around and picks the closest other party
member, and follows that person thereafter.
