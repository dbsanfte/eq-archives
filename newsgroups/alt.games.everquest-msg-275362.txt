I have 2 tradeskillers, a jeweller and a carpenter.  I can sell
jewellry fairly well, but you're right about furniture - I've sold 2
or 3 beds, compared to dozens of Lore bodyparts and collectables.

>I must admit though I love the warped bone and fir beds :) 

The only rares I have are the ones I've found - one Runnyeye and
Splitpaw they sell for at least 10g.

I have a bone bookcase, which is ugly (and doesn't hold books) and a
Fir bench.  I'm still in my starter apartment, so I'll have to wait
until I get a better place to see how they defray costs.

As for cash, I make a few gold a day, usually seling collectables,
Lore body parts, resources and Adept 1's.  I generally spend them on
Adept 1's and completing collections.

I recently have over 10g, for the first time every - I went to the
broker and spent about 8g on a couple of adept 1s and app 4s, some
Advanced Woodworking scrolls and better armour for my lvl 19 Cleric.

I actually only starting selling very recently - I had always assumed
you have to be online overnight for hours at a time to make any money,
but soon leaned you can make a fair amount fo cash in an hour or 2.

Bunnies aren't just cute like everybody supposes !
They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
