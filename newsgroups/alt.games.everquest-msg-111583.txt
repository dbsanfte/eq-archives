Being new on my server, after a mid-EQ move, I found myself in Qeynos,
feeling somewhat naked as I was slaying a_bat43 for the umpth time. As I
turned around to go kill a_bat56, a tall, dark, handsome Erudite stood
before me. He handed me a blackened crystalline robe, and told me to have
fun. I was gobsmacked... At level 3, I had this awesome robe. I thanked him
as best I could, and put it on. (Green does look good with red hair) Today,
I am level 32, and I am still wearing it, and I always tell people about
that nice guy that gave it to me. :o)
