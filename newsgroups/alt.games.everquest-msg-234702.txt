Background: Lvl 60 chanter, stat in question is CHA at 200 self
buffed.

While in an LDoN adv, I got a +5 CHA aug. It was an all slot aug.
After adv I went to bidbath and augmented an earring with a type 7
slot available, and it took (I saw augment on earring); however, it
didnt change my CHA stat at all! Now, the earring I aug'd was +5 CHA
to begin with, so should now be +10. I take off earring, see my CHA
fall to 195, put earring back on, and it goes back to 200 (not 205
like it is supposed to). I zoned, relogged, and made doubly-sure my
CHA COULD go over 200 my equipping 2 CHA steins. But it seems my aug
isnt affecting stats.

Any ideas?
