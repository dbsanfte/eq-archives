I have been trying to find Banshee Aura just so I can do this. I was told
that it really helps to have a damage shield with these guys because they
hit so fast.  At 24th level I still have not found the words for this 16th
level spell.  It is also a higher level SK spell, so I tried SK guilds too
but no luck.  Any idea where I can buy this spell???

By the way, I also tried the gypsies in Oasis and it is not there either.
