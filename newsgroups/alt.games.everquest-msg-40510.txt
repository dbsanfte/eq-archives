Totally depends on the 3D engine and how it makes use of your 3D cards
features. There's many 3D cards outperforming each other in two games,
because the engine works differently. Modern cards like NVidia's line
take more and more work off CPU, so you should be fine with any current
CPU, as even the lowest end 800+ MHz ones are blazing fast. As for
3D cards, a modern 'mid-level' card is an nvidia GeForce 2 MX 400.
It is faster than the old MX series and still relatively cheap. If
you want the biggest power, go GeForce2 (or 3 .. but 3 is sometimes
slower than 2 .. depends on the engine and features used). These
are expensive, though. I'd not buy any other brand. There are good other
cards, but it seems NVidia is more and more taking the lead (no, I am not
in any way affiliated with them).
