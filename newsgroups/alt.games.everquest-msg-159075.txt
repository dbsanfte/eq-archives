Would that be the same strategy guide that said SK's needed CHA and WIS,
that wizards got a locate corpse spell, and that at high levels a necro
could sit idely chatting whilst his pet destroyed the city guards?

That book was FULL of glaring errors, so a quote from it doesn't hold much
sway with me.

Also it wasnt made by VI, I got the impression it was feedback from beta
testers that made it into the character info/character tips/group/solo
tactics etc..
