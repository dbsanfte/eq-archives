Coming up on level 19 and have all spells but Celestial Remedy. Caster's
Realm shows it as a SOL (which I don't have) spell using 190 Mana for a
Single Target Heal@260 hp over 24 seconds.

C.R. shows my present level 14 Healing spell as using 60 Mana for a
Single Target Heal@100hp instantly. Even though the highest I've seen in
text is "healed for 92", isn't this still more mana efficient than Cel
Rem?

thanks
