Actually he hits really hard with that proc built in.  I forget if he
flurries or not, but quad hits at least.  4 procs for 500 each, plus 4 hits
for 200 each is a good 3000 damage per round.  (Assuming he takes all his
swings that round.)  If he flurries, add up to two hits for 4300 total
possible damage that round.

That shouldn't be enough that the paladins don't have time to LH before the
next round (1 secondish "cast time")... unless the raid leader told the
clerics not to buff, and only to CH.

The most dangerous parts of a raid are the first ten seconds, and any time
the MT dies.   If nobody is tanking and getting constant heals while doing
it, things fall apart very quickly, especially on a mob that does this much
damage.   I"m not suprised that the rest of the raid went down very quickly.
If the MT was over 55 though, that shouldn't have went like that.

I'm not sure why he was that easy for you.   Maybe you had some good
enchanters chain runing you (which would block the proc as well as the
damage) while you did it.  Unless I'm seriously misremembering though, the
General has /significant/ damage output, tied with Lhranc among Kunark/Epic
mobs, and second only to real VS (if you're not chain runing to block his
lifetaps).
