Mixed. Some improvement - some hassle. 

Pok seemed alot laggier yet the bazaar was smoother. Go figure. The
skys and all that were prettier and the new rain effects Ive seen are
cool, yet, it now rains indoors.

The real problem was getting stuck on geometry. Twice in Cazic thule
with 2 different characters at 2 different spots, we got stuck on
ladders. Not a real safe place to get stuck I might add. Read in the
patch message about the /rewind command and how its supposed to help
characters stuck in geometry, but when trying the command, we were
told it was an invalid command *shrugs*
