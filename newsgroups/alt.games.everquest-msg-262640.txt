I can't agree.

In fact, people voting for someone they knew damn well couldn't possibly 
win is what gave us King George in the first place; if the Nader voters 
had gone with their second choice, which most said was Gore, then we'd 
all be complaining about how poorly nonweird Al dealt with 9/11.

However, it is clear that the republicans know this, and are doing 
everything they can to give every potential Nader voter a way to not 
vote for the only real opponent to the boy king.

That said, I still think its reprehensible that democrats are working 
their tails off to prevent him being on the ballots, which strikes me as 
a sadly non democratic idea.
