    Raid XP is bizarre sometimes. I find if I can get on the hate list at
the right time I can get my group XP we don't otherwise deserve. Once in
NToV a warrior was offtanking an add, and I CHealed him once. As the rest of
the raid finished the first mob, the offtank warrior died and the raid group
engaged the mob. I cast one 60 damage stun on it to ensure I'd get the
faction hit. My group got XP. My group of a bard, four clerics (all others
healing, not nuking), and an AFK necro got XP. YOU explain it if it isn't
hate-related. :-)
