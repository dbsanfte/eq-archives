I have seen a few of the people that don't seem to have any curtesy at
all, asking for stuff all the time, i never think that i have asked
for a sow even though i got my lvl 5 wiz killed at the far end of
western karana, took me many tries to get to the corpse, but i did it,
my lvl 14 necro has now the ability to bind and i have noticed that
some people gladly pay you say 2pp for the help, others don't even
say thanks, and that has been people at say lvl 20+, that i consider
rude, okey that they don't shower me with money but thanks is in
order.

I try to help other newbies when i can, since i have been helped
myself, both with money and a fine steel great staff, and i have to
admit that it feels good to help someone out, say heal them when they
are in trouble so they can get the kill and xp instead of my slashing
the mon and get no xp.

I tried last night to give away some stuff, a cloth cape and a giant
snake fang(good weapon) i did send tell to a lvl 1 wiz but she never
even replied, made me somewhat angry.

I also helped a guy being a container while he logged of and logged
back on as another guy, for the trouble of holding 4 items for a short
while he gave me 50pp 120gp and buffs that made me like superman,
chloroplast and sow and strengthen and more, made it easy in bb
for a while until i got 4 of them gnolls at me at the same time.
