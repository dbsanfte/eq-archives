Well I've played this crazy game on and off since beta and yesterday finally
got my bard his journeyman boots.  For those non bards wondering, why the
frick would a bard need jboots?  It is to make 3 chant kiting MUCH easier
and a few mobs have a bad habit of trying to dispell Selos.

Anyhow, I started this quest just the other day.  In South Ro, I managed to
find the Ancient Cyclops in about 15 minutes and obtained the ring.  This
was the easiest part... then off to West commons... after rolling through 15
shadowmen, one finally dropped the rapier (wow are they FAST!)

Lastly, stupid hasten bootstrutter... 3 hours I waited for that little
dork.... I finally found him on track, turned in my 3250 gold (I did not use
plat) and got the boots... hurray!

Oh, I chant kited hasten afterwards for making me wait so long.
