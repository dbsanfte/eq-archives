From the shadows, the mysterious newshound007@freedom.net
(newshound007) (if that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

You can (on the OOT boat), but you had to find the right spot. It's
been a long time, though, so couldn't tell you where that spot was. I
just remember twitching around looking for it inch by inch near the

I've never tried in timo or erudxing.

They have to move, then they are visible.

Actually they didn't USE to. I have no idea what changed but they were
actually quite reliable at one time. Nowadays they are like
permabroken.

Ugh. The worst sort of people hung around there (druid rings at least)
- the beggar population. I used to dread porting into WC.
