So now enchanters are unable to solo - as effectively we can't do enough
damage. I have a mage friend who can solo in PoS for 7 % aa per kill and
doing 2 kills per 10 mins.  I maybe would have been able to match this with
CoD (if I was lucky) but now I have to out damage the pet to get a
reasonable amount of xp - seems they have just taken a lot of the fun from
chanters again - back to hasting and clarity.
