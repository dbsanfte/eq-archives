Straw man..  If other factors and considerations indicated such a
war/attack is possible and/or likely then certaintly a US pre-emptive
strike is logical and legitimate.

It would be.  The aftermath (as you describe it) would not be.

I can't..

I can't understand (and have stated so many times) how someone can
walk into a house and murder a woman and her three children.

I CAN understand why such an attack on the USS Liberty would be
launched.

If you are talking about the attack itself, I disagree.  If you are
discussing what occurred in the aftermath then, if what you describe
is accurate, then I would agree with you.

That one aspect of the attack is, you are correct.  IF it, in fact,
happened...

As long as you seperate the attack from what you described as the
aftermath, then I would agree with you..

The entire attack was NOT a war crime and/or atrocity..  The aftermath
as you describe it, would be.

I am saying it's possible.  Due to the cover-up, no one can be sure of

If we are talking about war crimes, you would be correct.

We are not..  Or at least, I am not...
