    There's a guild on my server that still has some hard feelings towards
my guild because of that "slight delay". We had just killed Aerin'Dar to
flag a large number of people, including many from other guilds. So we had a
silly number of people at the raid - close to 100. The end of the flagging
process involves heading down a ravine under where Aerin'Dar spawns, and
zoning into Halls of Honor. You must do this to get the HoH flag.

    About a minute before we zoned in, a smaller competitor had just started
the Rydda'Dar trial in HoH. They had never beaten it before, and given their
guild makeup it was a very tough encounter for them.

    They were wiped when 100 people all zoned in at once, causing a massive
amount of graphics lag. When they came back, all they saw were a bunch of
people mostly from two rival guilds there, and they assumed we'd done it to
grief them. Um, whoops?
