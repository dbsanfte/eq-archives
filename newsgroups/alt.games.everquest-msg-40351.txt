You can probably sell it for more. I paid 400 or 500 for mine.

If you want 'bank clutter', I have a small fine plate breastplate,
dyed black. I bought it last year on my birthday (wasn't having a good
day otherwise so I decided to splurge in game) and paid 200 pp for the
breastplate, then ran to halas and paid a shaman 150 pp to dye it
black. Not only did the shade turn out much lighter than anticipated
(it's slightly darker than dusty, but lighter than both charred and
enameled black) but the dusty BP has made it obsolete by better stats
and mimicking color - ANY color but the expensive black would more
than likely sell better :)
