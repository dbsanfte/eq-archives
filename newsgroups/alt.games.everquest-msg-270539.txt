I like EQ2.  I really do.  Sure, unless you have a decent machine to
run it on (I don't and can't afford to upgrade), the graphics on my
machine is worse than CoH or EQ1 ever was -- people are nearly
faceless, costumes look all grey unless you get up close, etc..   I
almost stop moving at all when I zone into Qeynos Harbor, or even
Castleview Hamlet during prime time.  And the combat and trade
systems itself feels more like whackamole than an rpg.  But still, the
world feels big, and some of the quests are kind of fun (Firemyst is a
blast).  

 BUT the community feeling is just not there.  The quest system
actually gives incentive to people to drop from groups early, leaving
fellow group members without healer, tank etc.  The tradeskill system
gives incentive to people to not produce trade items that other
tradeskill classes need, and instead create alts that can use them.
Elitism and intollerance are so rampant that when I appologized to
another group for accidentally pulling a mob that another group was
camping (we didn't know they were camping it) I got grief fro our tank
who proceded to drop from the group a minute later over nonsense.  No
one is recruiting to group -- I've seen groups prefer to wipe on the
same mobs over and over again sooner than to try to invite someone
else who's actually lfg.  And the rare times that I do get a group, I
feel like I'm treated like an npc or a pet.  I'm just a tool for
others to achieve their personal goals, and screw me if I happen to
need another nearby mob for my own quests.

Now, honestly, if I'm going to be exp grinding, the quality of the
group tends to be far better.  But I didnt' come to EQ2 to repeat the
same old combats over and over and over again.  Camping (as well as CH
chains and raiding) is what burned me out on EQ1 to begin with.

So my question is, does WoW have similar problems?  I am not a
Warcraft fan at all, so if I come to Warcraft, it won't be for the
graphics or for the world, but for a sense of community.  I don't want
to spend all day with LFG up soloing -- Soloing is fine to kill time
between groups, or when I'm home sick and don't want to inflict my
nyquil-soaked brain on others.  But it's not really why I play these
types of games.
