But I've long since stuck with EQ for friends not for content. If I 
could have switched them to AO i'd have done so. WoW is looking more and 
more like the place to be.

SOE has needed to get their act together for a long time. For the EQ 
diehards that aren't thinking of making the switch this is still good 
news... WoW will hopefully 'motivate' SOE into delivering a better 
product then they've felt compelled to historically.

And nothing to do with DX9 i suspect <grins>... in fact AL's goodbye eq 
site laments broken quests and endgame encounters not puddles with rain 
drop reflections in them <g>
