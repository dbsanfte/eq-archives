just don't take Magelo's numbers as Gospel:

Right now it's showing my BL at 3928 HP and I only have
3851.  I can't find a single item that's wrong, my Sta is
right and my stat food is right.

/puzzled

Prior to that it showed him at 3799 when he had 3800 even
(that little error wasn't a problem though).

Also, it won't calculate your AC and ATK exactly - that's
why they give you a fudge factor to adjust it by (it calculates
my AC 20 points lower than it is in game).
