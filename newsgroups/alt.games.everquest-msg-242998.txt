Unfortunately I think these days it's rather difficult to actually find
enough people to actually -get- groups with outside the "fast track". While
changes to the game itself may be somewhat to blame for this, I'd have to
say I think the primary cause is that the majority of low level characters
seem to be alts of high level characters, well equipped and aiming to just
level up. They're unlikely to care about loot so they go for maximum
experience.

Unfortunately as a newbie I suspect for a lot of people, once you find where
you can get groups, you go there and group, and so your gear suffers as the
high exp zones often seem to have subpar loot as you say.

If what seems to be the majority of existing players were a little less
concerned with optimal alt experience, I think the new players would get a
bit of an easier time of it in terms of learning the game, but I think
that's probably unrealistic to expect. I suspect that the worst "dumbing
down" of the game comes from finding yourself in groups of uber twinked low
level alts without having any real impetus to learning new things.

As for the changes to the game, sure there might be some dumbing down, but
there's also been a lot of smartening up. For example ( and there are many
more ), a game where you:

1/ Are required to go and read external forums to even be effective at your
class in many cases, due to lack of in game information and overly basic
documentation
2/ Buy spells without any idea of what they can actually do ( When I
started, I couldn't believe they did that. While exploratory it's rather
stupid as in a more real life situation you could just find out or ask your
guildmaster )
3/ Talk to Quest NPCs who give utterly vague and often relatively useless
information that give little idea of what where and who. ( "The only advice
I can give you is to look for ones such as yourself'" druid epic anyone? ...
Now go and talk to every NPC in every zone you can, ask them if they are one
such as yourself. What fun! :) ) and of course many other examples. These
could still use a lot of work.

...and similar obfuscations that made the game actually less immersive and
less informative, is not a smart game imo, it's a dumb game. Therefore I'm
grateful for a lot of the changes that have made the game more user friendly
for new players. I know that my definition is going to be different from
other people's of course. If products I worked on required people to find
their information outside the product as much as eq historically does I'd be
shot! If we treat new players well, help them out and give friendly advice
as well as alerting them to the pitfalls they could encounter as they level
up then I think it will do a lot for them. A few minutes out of optimal
experience never hurt me badly enough that I couldn't help out a real
newbie. Ironically the ones who are the most polite in my experience have
been these players as they don't even know what "SOW PLZ!" means :)

Just my 2c
