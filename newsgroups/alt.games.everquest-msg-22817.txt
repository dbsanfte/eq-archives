Really weird! I just bought a GeForce2 mx 64mg AGP slot card. That
was a step up from an ATI Rage Pro 12mb PCI card.

I've now spent 4 days updating my motherboard's drivers. Updating the
card's drivers, but still I have a problem!

After about 45 minutes of playing EverQuest FREEZES. The only way
to get out of the game is to physically REBOOT it.

I've never had this problem before with my old card. There aren't any
conflicts or any of the normal stuff. I work in the tech field so I at least
know what I am doing, but after all these updates and searching I'm
just beside myself. I even REINSTALLED EverQuest to see if something
was corrupt in game, but that didnt help. I also removed all instances of
my old ATI drivers, just in case if there was a driver conflict of some
sort.

Looks like I'm going back to Best Buy before I see Jurassic Park 3...

/sigh
