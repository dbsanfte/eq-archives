Aye, I agree.  Both sides make a point and don't feel either is without
merit, but it is the nature of the beast for the test server, when they do
something significant (change the GUI) and only do it to the test server
(only 1 test server up BTW) that server will get swamped.  It's not fair to
ask the whole community not to check it out.  At the same time I understand
why some may play on the test server as their main to always see the latest
things.  Those people are also the reason the test server works.  The people
who jump on the test server to check something out and get off are
contibuting very little to the development IMO except stress testing.

Bertoxx Server

All in all nothing new to say (just the obvious)
