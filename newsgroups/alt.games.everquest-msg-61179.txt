Ruins of Kunark:  Opened up the continent of Kunark.  New race:  Iksar
(lizard people).  Their starting city is Cabalis, and they are an evil race.
Their civilization is just starting to re-emerge after a long barbaric Dark
Age.  They can go from levels 1-60 just on Kunark, or so I've heard.  I
haven't explored it much, but I've heard others comment that all of Kunark
has a "Jurassic Park" feel to it.

Scars of Velious:  Opened up the continent of Velious.  Think:  Antarctica.
A group of Gnome Pirates established a route to this continent, where we
discover a band of lost Dwarves has established a tiny civilization of their
own.  They are in constant warfare with the Giants of Velious (who are much
more intelligent and civilized than their Antonican counterparts..they even
have their own city).  The giants are in constant warfare with the Dragons
of the land.  Very dangerous areas, neat loot.  Many say this expansion
embodies EQ the way it was meant to be.

Shadows of Luclin:  Yet to be released.  Opens up the Norrathian Moon for
adventuring.  Home of the Vah'shir, (the Kerrans, or Cat People).  New race,
new class (the Beastlord, Shaman/warrior hybrid), new stuff, new graphics.
