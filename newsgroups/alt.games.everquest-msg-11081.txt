While I certainly like the idea of a shorty being too short to use
that ladder, I have run into the same problem as a wood elf, and the
troll I was with also had the problem.  It was one of the more
frustrating things that happened to me, invis dropped, I run like
hell, hit the ladder and see a troll stuck at the top of the ladder.
I ask him to move, he says he's stuck, he moves, I can't get off the
ladder.  The frogs eventually kill us.  By the time I got back and
recovered my corpse I was able to get up the ladder fine.  It happened
to me one other time, and I was able to finally get up by jumping at
the top of the ladder, but that hadn't worked before.  I find that
Upper Guk has some rather interesting bugs that have been there for a
LONG time.  (There's a spot in the water under the spider crossroads
bridge that you hit and fall for 10k damage every time.  The really
annoying part is that it's way too close to the ladder that gets you
out of the water.  GMs gave me full-exp resses the 3 times it happened
to me with no questions asked.)
