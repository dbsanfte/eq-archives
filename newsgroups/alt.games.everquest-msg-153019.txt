I got a rather odd result today while factioning in Blackburrow.

I wandered down onto the bridge in the centre of BB, and proceeded to
pop Lifetap (5 point DD) on every gnoll currently engaged in combat.
So far, no problem.

A warrior had 2 on him, and was getting in trouble.  I popped both of
his opponents for the faction then, as the first one dropped, I hit
the second one with Darkness, followed by Fear.  It ran, and he
proceeded to beat it to death.

When it died, *I* got the credit for the kill.  Now, I did exactly 5
points of damage to that thing.  How'd I get the looting rights?
