Oh bloody hell, I (being a complete newbie to EQ) did the same thing with my
Wiz, I destroyed my note. Actually I as told to destroy it by another
player, (now I'm a bit wiser I think he meant my PoD book lol) anyway I
never gave my guild leader my note, hence I never received my newbie robe.

Do you really need to give a guild leader the note? does not giving him/her
it effect the game in the long run? as I'm now lvl 18 I've not noticed
anything amiss - but then again this is my first character, so I could be
missing something.

Any advice would stop my panic attack :)
