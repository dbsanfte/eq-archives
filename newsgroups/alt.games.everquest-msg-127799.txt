I thought about that.. what it came down to is that C# and .NET are the
tools I wanted to use and since I'm doing this for myself and giving this
away for free, well, I don't mind so much if people choose not to use it
because of the runtime.

If this was shareware or if I was trying to sell this then I may have chosen
to develop it in C++ instead.

On the other hand, the .NET runtime has been on Windows Update for a while,
and will probably be a standard part of preloaded systems in the near
future - I figure it's only a matter of time before everyone has it anyway.
