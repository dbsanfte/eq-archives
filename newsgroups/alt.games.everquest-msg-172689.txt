The original statement was:
    ...in a pickup group of strangers NBG is a lie used to
    promote the greed of players who only go where the loot they want
    drops.
There's no qualification there. No mention or allowance for cases where
it may be false. It's a generality; generalities are usually false and
disproven by a single counterexample - which he did.

So yes, it was generic ("Relating to or descriptive of an entire group
or class; general") but it was also an absolute in that it's an
unqualified statement *applied* to a generality.

To phrase something roughly equivalent using an everyday example...
    ...In politics politicians will do anything to stay in power.
To disprove, find a single politician who will not do anything to stay
in power. (Not hard... I hope.)

Inserting the word "typically" or "usually" (thus "NBG is typically a
lie...") would soften it to the point where a more general disproof would
be required.
