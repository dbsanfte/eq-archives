I dont understand the drive for intelligence on enchanters. My enchanters
level 40, with int of about 140 (I customized chr). I dont find my mana pool
to be a problem. Making my mana pool bigger isnt going to help me, yet
increasing my charisma certainly is. Id sooner have hit point gear than int
too.

Same is true of druids. It seems to be common thinking that druids need
heaps of wisdom. I guess they do if they are quad kiting, but im sure I
could get by on 140's wisdom if I were grouping. Again, I'd sooner have
armor class, hitpoints or something else useful (right click effects, worn
effects)
