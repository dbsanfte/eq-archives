I did a similar thing.  Though I was porting to Odus, but then got
"Loading...please wait!" and then say "You have entered the Great Divide."
Funny to see someone shouting to the zone asking (just to re-assure myself)
that they're seeing snow everywhere, and if Great divide is in Velious.
Then stating that they're only LV 12 (which follows by laughter).  Then
after asking (again in shout) where the porter to Luclin was, and finding
out there was a ring war going on, and again more shouting asking if anyone
near the portal ring can see through invis, then climbing the spire to have
a long lookout range, then more shouting about a herd of giants stomping my
way (which luckily turned & went up the mountain), followed by another shout
saying that I just remembered I was bound in Shadow Haven (zone next to
Nexus) & have gate as well.
    Someone volunteered to port me to Tox though (free).  I guess they
didn't go though?  They just cast port, and then when I accepted the
confirmation box, I guess they denied theirs?
