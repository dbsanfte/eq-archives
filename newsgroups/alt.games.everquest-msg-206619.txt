had a thought this morning, and couldn't find any info to verify it...is 
there a way to add your amount of mana to the playerinfo window?  I don't 
mean as a percent, but as an integer?

For example, if you have a total mana pool of 1000, could you have the 
bar,   the % and a number?  (say, half bar, 51%, 510)

I don't know that this would actually be beneficial, but it might be cool 
for a minute or two.

Just wondering about it.  SOMEWHERE the game (either server or client 
side) has to know the amount you have in integer form, so I figured maybe 
you could show it as such.
