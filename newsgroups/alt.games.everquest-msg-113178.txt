Indeed.  The limiting factor then becomes the spawn rate of the mobs
you're killing.  If you're continuously fighting with little to no
downtime, adding 1 high damage output member to the group will almost
certainly improve the XP flow.

On the other hand, if you're sitting around waiting for respawn, or
waiting for the puller to bring mobs back all time (often the case in
outdoor zones), adding a 6th member will likely slow your XP flow.
