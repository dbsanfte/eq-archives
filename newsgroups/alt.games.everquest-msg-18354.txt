I think the Dorf joke may predate Tim Conway's version.  I also know that a
bunch of people that were not fans of his have been using dorf in the AD&D
world for years.  Whether or not this was originally related to Conway's
humor or not, and just repeated by the unwashed, I do not know.  Dorf has
been used in Dragon magazine, gamer jokes, and so on, for a long time.  So
it migrated to EQ.  Oooh.  Big deal.

You should see teenagers chat messages.  You want to talk about hacked apart
and shortened words!
