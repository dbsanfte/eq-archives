}Except in many, many, many pieces instead of one piece.  

It is possible to do single-file .rars.  multi-part .zips are also 
possible.  

There are also .arc, .ace, .arj, .gzip, .tar, and about half a jillon 
others.  Well, actually, .tar just concatenates files without compression, 
and then it gets really complicated because gzipping .tars is common...

Why, oh why, can't we agree on a single standard for LZ compression?  And 
a single GPL-Licensed free utility for it? :) Yeah, I know about the 
copyright issues with the LZ compression algorithm, I'm just whining.

}(Note: I know this from downloading *anime*.  Not porn.  ...and don't ask 
}about that folder marked 'hentai'.)

Mmmm... Hentai. :)
