If you really have the ability to "use up" either hp or mana to win a
fight (and I can certainly believe SKs can do that) it seems like
maintaining even bars might be optimal, but not necessary.  Say you
get down to the point where you are almost oom but 75% health.  You
rest up till you are full health, 25% mana, and then the next fight
you "take it on the chin" more and use your melee to win instead of
your spells... knocking your health down more than your mana.
