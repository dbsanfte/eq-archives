How I use the different filters:

Tracksort normal
-Doing the forager or hunter cycle in Trakanon...Keep tracksort
normal.  When you kill your frog, hit track and the frog or better yet
named that you spawned is at the very top of the list.  (Also filter
green and lightblue out assuming most of the other frogs are green)
-Sitting at pretty much any camp where named mobs will pop.  Keep
track open, always, hitting track every time it refreshes.  Within a
second or two of a named popping, I can be off chasing it down even
while the group finishes the kill.
-Calling bullshit when someone claims they have been camping a spot
longer than someone else.  You can actually see when they entered the
zone reletive to when other PCs enter the zone...as long as neither is
in the group.
-Looking for corpses in those situations where you can track them. 
(Actually I havent seen a corpse on track in my group in a while, has
this been nerfed?).  Anyway, track normal and if someone just died
their corpse will be at the top of the list, listed in the color that
the player would /con if he were a NPC.
-Note that normal is perfect for hill giants in rathe.  We all know
they have a life expectancy of about 15 seconds.  That means that you
want to run toward the newest pop first, not the closest one.

Filtering colors
-Someone asks me to see if so-and-so is up.  I ask, "what level?". 
They reply, "40-ish".  Ok that is blue to me.  I then filter out
greens, lb, white, yellow, red, and players to make it much easier to
search for the MOB.
-Hunting in a zone where there are wide ranges of mob levels; sort out
all the greens...

Tracksort distance
-Chain pulling, either at 10% or just after death, find the closest
mob for the shortest pull with the fewest likely adds.
-Holding a contested spawn.  Just yesterday I was doing stormfeather
in Ice Clad Ocean.  (Got my EPoP woot).  Every 15 minutes it seems,
someone new zones in.  Hit "/" to see what level they are if possible.
 If they are 40 or higher, I assume they are not there for cougars and
I get worried about someone trying to KS.  So I sort normal and look
at their relative positions.  If they are lower on the list than say,
the soulbinder, then they are probably going to TOFS, waiting on Lodi,
or doing the 8th Shawl.  The important thing is I know how far they
are from me and I can keep hitting track to see if they are getting
closer or farther.

Tracksort rdistance.
-Useful if you are running toward someone or something while it is
beyond your range.  When it pops in to range, it will come up on track
near the top.

Most people have answered this well enough.  I will just say that
rangers are probably the best or second best melee soloers.  Bards
have some nice tools to get very good solo experience.  But they are
limited to certain parts of certain zones.  Besides, aggro kiting is
very dangerous.

My 59 ranger solos all the time.  Don't know about tier 2 and tier 3
but I can fearkite in PoD and PoN.  I can also get reasonably good exp
straight meleeing guards in PoJ.  I have even killed several High
Guardians of Justice (the level 60 guards) by snaring and kiting
around the entrance area.  Now considering the time it takes to kill
one and the danger involved to myself (and really everyone in the
zone) it is probably more efficient to kill blues.  But nothing is
more satisfying to me than killing a mob that is higher level,
especially with a melee class.
