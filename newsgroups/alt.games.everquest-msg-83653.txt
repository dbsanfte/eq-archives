Evil is...

Charming a bat and having him attack the Kelethin PoD, poor batty.  =(

Charming Mangler in Rivervale, scaring the shit out of newbies with him (he
gives bad RV faction when killed, the idea is for newbie rogues to
sneak/hide around him to get a note off the bed in the room he guards, but
someone inevitably aggroes him and runs around trying to get guards to help,
which they won't, and dying, then pissing some high level off when Mangler
attacks and they kill him and get bad faction)
To avoid the bad faction, target the PoD and type /pet kill.  Then get the
hell out of there.  (guards won't assist like in Kelethin)

Manaburn from a 60 wizzy in PvP (17k DD lure resist, why not call it PC DT?)

Having Booboo the bear pet take a harm/death touch.

Sitting an ogre or troll at the lavastorm zone out in Sol A  "move please mr
fatty"

Sitting an ogre or troll in the hall outside Frenzy in Lguk... with a wood
elf trapped in the corner behind him. (yes, they really do smell as bad as
they look)

Making something "immune to changes in movement speed" when you try to root
it, but only "your Ensnare has been resisted" all 7 fucking times you try to
snare it.   (yes, I cast snare 7 times before I tried root)

Rooting a charmed PC then killing him... even when he's green to you.

Not warning the zone when you kill Chief Ry'Gorr.

Training ALL the orcs in CC on the dorfs, then gating when they start to
arrive in town...

Training me with anything.  Ever.  (well, ok, exceptions for that dracnid, I
got a crystal webshield off him)

Pathing stupid skeletons into the CoM entry in EJ.

Giving any spells that made the druid class semi-desireable in a group away.
(pack spirit -> spirit of Bih'Li; RoTG -> Regrowth of Dar Khura)

Calling newbies to spec isle in Oasis to get buffs.  (Well, not really evil
but it seems like it at first)
