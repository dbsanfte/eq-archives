Actually this is kinda wrong. Many species are far closer to extinction than
you might realize. Many more species have had their populations decimated.
Human intervention is one of the primary causes of both the depletion and
erradication. On the other hand it probably dosent matter much since it is
fairly clear that species are supposed to go extinct all the time . You look
for fossils and almost all of those species have no living members today.

When I was young fish was considered a lower class food. Now it is
considered as a luxory food. Since I love fish this is somewhat annoying :)
