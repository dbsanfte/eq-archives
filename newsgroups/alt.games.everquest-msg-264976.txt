Hackmaster is waaay overpriced. unpack your first edition D&D books and 
you have approximatly the same thing, without the jokes built in. Add a 
few extra spells (Fireball mk2, fireball mk 3, etc..) and you are good 
to go.

I understand the hackmaster stuff is actually based on D&D first or 
second edition licensed from TSR.

I have gone through stages myself. My best two games I ever ran were an 
old D&D game that slid from the little grey books into First Edition. We 
picked me to run it, and I did.

My other monster epic game was my 6 year Robotech campaign... And man 
that game system sucked. (Palladium)

I've played so many systems I can't even begin to list them all... I 
have not seen a system on this list I'm not at least somewhat familier with.
My only problem with the Champions and Gurps systems is they always 
struck me as great game systems to have a computer do all the figuring 
for me.  That and you always got the guy that wants to massage the 
points (I will admit to having the tendancy myself) for maximum 
effectivness.

These days I've been toying with setting something up under Tri-stat, 
which is kind of a lite and fast point build system. I like having 
fights last 5 min (real time)
