I took up a tradeskill - smithing in my case.  Got it up to GM level, then
began taking orders.  I've earned perhaps 500K from my smithing and I
currently have 200K in the bank not doing much of anything.  I used it to
buy all my spells, including 80K for Hand of Virtue when I could have had it
for free if I'd just waited a couple of weeks.  =(

That's a big time sink and perhaps you don't want to go all the way to 250.
But you can make decent profits on smaller-scale stuff.  For example,
Celestial Essence is a no-fail combine.  You just need a mortar and pestle,
Celestial Solvent, and Scent of Marr, all sold in the Plane of Knowledge.
Costs about 3pp to make one Celestial Essence.  You can sell them for 5pp or
10pp each.  I know that when I need Celestial Essences, I'd much rather buy
them in quantity from someone who's already made them rather than go through
the time and effort of making them myself.  No, you're not going to make
hundred of thousands of plat this way, but it will be a steady income,
especially if you can leave a bazaar alt logged in all the time.

Leather padding is also a good thing to sell - just farm some pelts.  You'll
need to get tailoring up to around 50, which is very easy to do.  This you
can also sell for a small but steady profit by leaving a bazaar alt on all
the time.

Or you can just farm.  Sebilis used to be a great place to go and farm gems,
although I think it got nerfed by the plat farmers.  PoI has lots of good
cash drops if you can solo the mobs.  Then there's the old standby of Rathe
Mountains, where the hill giants drop a ton of plat if you don't mind
fighting off a couple of dozen other people with the same idea.
