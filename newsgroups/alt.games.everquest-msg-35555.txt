I took my troll warrior through there for the very first time last night. The lone
guard in front of the BB entrance tends to move around a bit, so it's easy to pass
him and stay out of his aggro range. For Bandl, it's a bit more of a problem. If you
can get a friends to pull a mammoth or something over there, you may get him far
enough off station. I just used an invis potion and ran past him.  Being a monk, you
can probably FD your way by if you need to.
