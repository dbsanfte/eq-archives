Just looked at it - the addition to the targetwindow xml file is pretty
straight forwards:

All that's needed is these 2 items -

	<Ui2DAnimation item = "A_TargetBox">
		<Cycle>false</Cycle>
		<Frames>
			<Texture>TargetBox.tga</Texture>
			<Location>
				<X>6</X>
				<Y>2</Y>
			</Location>
			<Size>
				<CX>116</CX>
				<CY>28</CY>
			</Size>
		</Frames>
	</Ui2DAnimation>

	<StaticAnimation item = "A_TargetBoxStaticAnim">
		<ScreenID>A_TargetBoxStaticAnim</ScreenID>
		<Animation>A_TargetBox</Animation>
	</StaticAnimation>



and 

		<Pieces>A_TargetBoxStaticAnim</Pieces>

in the pieces section.


Took all of 3 minutes to add it to my custom target window for the
UI I'm making.

Of course, I had to back it out again as it isn't live yet :)
