Where do the numbers come from?
Any official statement or info on this?

Did Hates Fury last night with my regular mid fifties group,
got 6 blues in 3 hours constantly moving and killing,pretty
disappointing,can do 2 hard Ldons in the same time,which 
give 4 blues each,not to speak of adv points and loot from
nameds.
And why do we have to move through a mix of live and
undead mobs,which are higher level than most mobs
in Hate's Fury, in Nadox to reach Hate's Fury ? - nice 
concept Sony.  :)
