Odd. I got this:

October 31th, 3:00 am
------------------------------

*By the pricking of my thumbs*

- A con man in The Temple of Solusek Ro has been warned by the gods
not to tease people about special weapons.
- Forest Barley can be found now, if you like that sort of thing.
- There are fewer blind frogloks in Guk.
- Small trees will fall more frequently in one of the Karanas
- Be careful in your travels over the next few days.  Something is
amiss on Norrath.

Trick or treat!

- The EverQuest Team


No idea what in the hell most of it means, though. A lot of the
"sounds" and "sndbk" files were updated. Wonder what was up with
that...
