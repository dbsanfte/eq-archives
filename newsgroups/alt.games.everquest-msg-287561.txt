Dear all,

My name is Matthew Ramsey and I am a social psychologist (and long
time gamer) with the University of New Hampshire.  We are currently
running a study on gaming and would like you to participate.


All participants can enter to receive a $25 gift certificate.

The link is: http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=oHBDmwHuC0ryuwyBCSc5KA_3d_3d


Thanks for your help!

Purpose:
With much of the recent research on gamming related to negative
outcomes (e.g., addiction and social isolation), we seek to examine
whether MMORPGs provide a social buffer against loneliness and lower
self-esteem in addition to providing a feeling of social support.
The UNH Institutional Review Board has assessed and accepted this
proposal.  There will be no risks beyond those encountered in everyday
conversation. This study will be completely confidential. No names
will be connected with any answers or opinions.  Participation in this
experiment will help assist research in psychology, which will
increase our understanding of the relation between online gaming and
social support.
