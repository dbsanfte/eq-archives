I'll try to time it tonight, but my machine is well above specs and the few
zones I've done last night actually ran >slower< with zone times.

Normally I had about 10 to 25 second zonetimes, now the first run was way
over 2 minutes (at least) and additional zones over the same zoneline
(trak-seb) still took roughly 1 minute.
I have no precise times here, but will try to get things together tonight.

I'm also mystified why EQ isn't just using more of my ram. I have 1.5gb,
which should hold all char models and probably a zone or 4. If the game
would keep the textures of the zone I'm in, the one I'm bound and fill the
rest of the memory with zones connected to the one I'm in, it could load
while you're running in a zone (low-priority load) and zone in seconds.

The last time I checked my memory via another computer while I was playing
EQ, only 650 MB was used...
