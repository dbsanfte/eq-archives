No, Mey has stated his (her?) point, it seemed like Mey had enough
experience with the spawn in question to know how it works.  Furthermore,
just about everyone else I know has the same opinion as to the frequency of
the Ragefire spawn.  It is not fixed, it is variable.  Yes, this is
different from most, if not all, other spawns in the game.  You disagree,
Mey has nothing more to add to what has been said, and refused to be drawn
into an "is too, is not" situation.
