Wait a second.  Let's explore that reasoning in a non-EQ situation, and see
what it sounds like.  Suppose I've got a cheap guitar...it cost $100, and
the top is plywood, and the tuning machines are plastic and not very good.
I paid for it myself.  That's the limit of my budget.

Some richer guitarist hears me playing, decides I have potential, but need
a better instrument or will be held back.  He gives me one of his old
instruments, which is a first class student instrument (say, something like
a Ramirez R2...worth about $1200).

By your reasoning, if I were to go to the beach or on a camping trip (where
the guitar is at reasonable risk of at least getting scratched up), I should
take the good guitar, because that is expendable, and leave the cheap one
safetly at home???
