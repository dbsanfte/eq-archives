Giants are terrible for this, for this reason I just know its going to
happen when any of the following occur

* people pull with snare, so the giant will only walk, no damage so
look like every other blinking giant in the zone...
* people stand on the hill to fight, get off the damn hill pull it
down, people wont think its free then.

We've all had it, I was there, it was probably down to around 60
health, Im standing bashing on it, hand to hand combat even, and some
"d00d" runs up starts casting on it, claims he "didnt see me" .. Im
sorry, IM BRIGHT RED HOW CAN YOU MISS ME??? And yes, then started
telling me *I* was the KSer.. Hmmmm...

Hes probably doing it like so many do to try and piss you off till you
leave the zone.  They try it on me, I just get grumpy back. 

As a bard my biggest annoyance is watching some low lvl bard go on the
kill run around grabbing a train of them and knowing hes not going to
make it, and knowing all the faces of other people watching as all the
giants follow this moron around and then he starts /y ing and then
imagining people laughing so much they cant see to help.. then of
course follows the abuse that no one helped him....

Theres plenty of spots to pull to down the sides of the hill, if
everyone did, it would be a much easier zone. Oh and of course pull
with some damage please.. That way its tagged..

(I have sent in feedbacks to SoE many times for there to be some
indication on the mob that its in battle with someone.. anything, a *
after its name, or something.. just so you know.. would make it so
much easier)
