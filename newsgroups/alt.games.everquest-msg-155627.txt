POTG does not stack with Aego or Heroism/heroic bonds
in addition to not stacking with BAOR.

This means that you can either choose

BAOR
Heroism
Symbol of Marzin

or you can chose
POTG
Symbol of Marzin

Aego is roughly the same buff as Heroism plus Symbol of Marzin, so another choice is

BAOR
Aego

Since as you've already noted, POTG is only 150 hp more than BAOR, the fact that it also
precludes Heroism/HB/Aego means that in fact you are throwing away a 400 hp buff to gain 150
hp.  Add in the vastly longer duration of Aego, and this spells a royal pain in the butt, as
a "fix"

While most spell casting classes are better off with POTG plus symbol (same HP, and more mana
regen) versus Aego, this is decidedly not true for clerics.  And since clerics are the only
class casting BAOR, its hard to see who benefits from this plan.

One possibility I haven't examined is that KF/POTG/Symbol may be superior to BAOR/Aego,
particularly now that clerics can make a significant melee contribution in small  groups.
I'm used to having Either KF OR POTG but not both at once as an option.  Since both KF and
POTG preclude BAOR, but not each other, this combination would probably be better assuming
you have constant access to both a druid and shaman to keep the darn buffs up.

Groups with Cleric/Druid/Shaman in them are not all that common, to my experience.
