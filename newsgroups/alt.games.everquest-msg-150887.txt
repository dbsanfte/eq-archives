Actually, if the truth be known, I'd port for nothing alot of the time just
to get to meet some of the people in Norrath.  I was just wondering if she
bestowed something nice on me or was she just giving me something worthless
in a tongue-in-cheek sort of way.

(I think the rarest thing I was ever given for a port was an emoted kiss
from a very nice dark elf lady.  Of course I let her know that it was worth
more than all the gold in Norrath.)
