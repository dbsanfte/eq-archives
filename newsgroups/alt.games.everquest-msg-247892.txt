I still have a number of the quest parts kicking around on one twink or 
another, been too lazy to dump them.  They don't sell well in the bazaar, 
due to the crappy stats of the rewards for the quests.  I'd bet that for 
less than the cost to buy the quest parts you could buy a better piece 
for the slot in question at this point.
