After going through two periods of account inactivity I started up again
last April.  Played full time from April to the end of August.  Then, after
seeing how SOE did not give a rip about their veteran players I did the
unmentionable thing.  I deleted my 63 Shadow Knight and 61 Monk.  Trust me.
If you really want to disconnect from this addition then deleting your toons
is the best way.  I tried SWG for awhile and then gave up after the first
free month was over.  When I am ready to experience my next MMORPG it will
not be with SOE.
