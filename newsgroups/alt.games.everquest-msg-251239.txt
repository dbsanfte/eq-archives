An analogy, without getting into such an emotion-laden subject as baby
killing...  it's also a personal pet peeve of mine.

The guy that stops and lets someone out of a parking lot.  He thinks he's
being polite.  I think he's a dick because he just was rude to the 10 people
behind him to be "nice" to the one he let out.

You call it utilitarian.  I prefer to think of myself as a "realist".  =)

Now, in the baby situation...  that's a very tough call.  I wouldn't want to
be the one that made that call, because either way there's going to be a
heaping helping of guilt to chew on.  Doctors *do* make similar calls all
the time, such as the recent story about the siamese twins that were
separated, knowing that it was possible for both to continue living joined,
and knowing that one of them would die after the separation (turns out both
died if I remember right, but one was a certainty).
