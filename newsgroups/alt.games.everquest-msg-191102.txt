The line with buffs is:
Breeze (+2 mana / tick, lvl 16 spell)
C1 = Clarity (+7 mana / tick, lvl 29 spell)
C2 = Clarity II (+11 mana / tick, lvl 54 spell)
C3 = Koadics Endless Intellect (+14 mana / tick, lvl 60 spell)
C4 = Tranquility (+16 mana / tick, lvl 63 spell)
C5 = Voice of Quellious (+18 mana / tick, lvl 65 spell)

People call it C1-5 because that's easy to remember and refering to. Most
people know KEi = C3, but don't ask them what the letters stand for :).
People like C3 the best because it stays so damn long (3 hours, the rest
last 2 hours or less).

Also, none of these buffs stack. C5 overwrite C4 etc. There are a few
enchanter buffs that stack next to C1 and C2 which don't stack with C3+
(basically, C3 is a 3 hour long single spell version for actually 3 other
buffs IIRC)
