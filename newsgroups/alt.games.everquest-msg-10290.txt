Run until you are far enough ahead to be out of casting range, stop (and
do the turn trick to make sure you are stopped), and start clicking BoF
or hitting the appropriate hot key so it starts casting as soon as the
mob enters spell range.  For mobs that run at normal speed, you should
have no trouble getting BoF on them before they are close enough for you
to catch yourself with the spell.

If you have a Staff of Temperate Flux, you can use it to judge the
distance.  Put it in a main inventory slot, and put that slot on a
hotkey, and then as you run away from the mob, just keep hitting the
SoTF hotkey a couple of times a second.  You'll get a message about
being out of range when you get far enough ahead.

Remember, BoF has a pretty small AoE range.  I've cast it on mobs that
were meleeing me, and not caught myself, if they were standing at the
edge of melee range.  You should be able to get any normal mob well
before they reach melee range.
