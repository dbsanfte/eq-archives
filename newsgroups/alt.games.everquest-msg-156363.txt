sorta makes me think of what happened to me the other morning.   Was
in Tenebrous Mountains... returning for my corpse after dieing in the
first grimling mine.     As Im looting my corpse I get whacked by lo
and behold  Grimling Runner... so I stand and start whooping up on him
and a mage nearby says  "You stole my runner"  and promptly nuukes the
runner to smithereenes.  

Well, I basicly gave the guy a WTF... and explained what happend...
His response was... Ive been waiting on him for an Hour.  
my response  "Your out of your friggin mind"  yeah I said frigging...
didnt want some stupid reason to report my ass.


o well.

some peeps are just fucked in the head.
