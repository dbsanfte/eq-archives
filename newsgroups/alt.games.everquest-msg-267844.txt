Yes, for the most part they are.   And secondly, if this is all your little
fit about posts not being labeled correctly, this is _not_ the way to convince
people to do it.

Good.  Go use it.   After all, it's an everquest group, not an EQ2 group!

It is obviously not being ignored.  The only obvious thing is that you're
overreacting over a few unmarked posts.

If a tree falls in the woods, and nobody is there to hear it... does it still
make a sound?

Or, put another way, if a discussion group exists on usenet, and nobody is
using it, who the fuck cares that it can still be accessed?

Theres no reason to go there if nobody is saying anything worth reading.   If
the groups don't have enough of a community for any interesting discussion to
form, they might as well not exist.

The reason for waiting has been explained to you several times.   If you don't
understand by now, you're obviously not going to.

1) You don't get to tell me to do anything.   Welcome to usenet.   And acting
like a self important jackass is not a good way to convince me to do it.

2)  It's not about balls, it's about doing whats best for the community.   The
fact that you don't understand that is sad, but it does explain your position
somewhat.

It risks the community that has formed here.

And for what?   For thier own identity?  I can only assume thats more of the
macho shit that makes you think this is all about who has bigger balls.   AGE
group members share an identity, which is part of what makes them a community.
Two smaller communities is not better than one single one, if neither has the
population to survive.  For a FAQ, which I already pointed out could be done
here just as easily?    For the chance that someone may use Google to search 5
years from now, instead of just asking the group or checking the FAQ?

Anyways, I think I'm probably about done with this discussion.    It's become
rather obvious that you're not listening to anything except what you want to
hear.
