Small correction - Katta Castellum merchants have formerly research only
spells for mages, chanters, and wizzys for levels 34 to 44, inclusive.
You're still on your own for levels 16 - 29, and for 49. And if you're a
necro, so far you're SoL although I kind of suspect they may be sold
somewhere on the moon and just undiscovered as yet. Katta and the
Tenebrous Mtns. are pretty goth places; a secret, well hidden necro
guild/vendor wouldn't surprise me a bit.
