Honestly, I don't think the game workings and rules should
necessarily be structured towards pleasing those people. If
it turns out pleasing them is the best way to make money,
sure. But it might not be.

No, it just cheapens it for people who care about that sort of thing.

Finding a cool magical item in a game is equivalent to winning
an Olympic medal? Not to me. It's not even a scale thing, it's
pure apples and oranges.

And how do you feel about the fact that anyone can go into
any gift shop in the world and buy a coffee mug or t-shirt
proclaiming them to be Father of the Year?
