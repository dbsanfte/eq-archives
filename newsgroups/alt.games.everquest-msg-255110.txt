Well, there's no way I know of, unless you accept some caveats:

1) If the only commands you want are for joining chat channels,
there's a command to specify those channels.

2) If you're willing to have it not be totally automatic, you can
just make one or more hotkeys that you always hit.  (Put them on
a separate hotkey bank if you don't need the commands to be handy
after startup.)

3) There might be a way to do it via a custom UI; I've never
tried setting up one of those.  But I wouldn't be surprised if
there's no way to do it, since providing a way to run commands
at startup would probably also mean there's a way to automate
running sequences of commands during the game, and I believe
that sort of things is limited to single hotkeys.
