 Not to mention this no longer works that well. Verant added a roamer or
two that pass by PoM cubby. It's probably possible if you're standing in
the very back not to get aggro, but one person not paying attention is
enough to get unintended aggro and make life painful. 

 Not to mention that's an exploit to skip content! Verant will ban you
for that!
