I'll give that a try, too. I've been trying to find a solution by
slogging through the old tech support website, but haven't had much
luck. Heh! Of course, I'm also starting to get a little impatient with
searching through all the archives.

Do you think it has anything to do with the fact that I'm using the
downloaded, Escape to Norrath version of the game? Heck, I can pick up
a CD of the original EQ for next to nothing if having those files might
help.
