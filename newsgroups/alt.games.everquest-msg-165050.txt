History's nice.  I'm actually quite fond of history.  However, we live in
today's world, not that of fifty years ago, or even twenty.  I do not
believe it's right to give prefferential treatment to people based on what
their parents went through.

You know I can't answer that question, as I'm not black.  However, ask JC
Watts, Ken Hamblin, Thomas Sowell, MMC (SW/AW) Keyes, or LT Willaims
(possibly LCDR by now) if they agree.  All of them are successful blacks who
weren't about to let their colour get in the way.  Hamblin and Sowell are
old enough to remember the "Colored" and "White" signs.  As Ken Hamblin what
he thinks about Affirmative Action.  He'll tell you that he's offended by
the very concept of it.

Yeah, there's racism in existance today, both white-on-black, and
black-on-white.  There is also tremendous oppertunity for those who can see
it.  This isn't the '70s, alot of things have changed.  Even if it were,
that does not give the government the right to discriminate.

Your point fails.  If Affirmative Action were ended today, would blacks be
forced to sit in the back of the busses?  That's FUD, and I don't buy it.

Also, not withstanding the fact that there are people who have had far worse
results from discrimination than I have, that still does not make any
discrimination right.

You would be surprised at how much things have settled.  I live in southern
Virginia, and have lived in South Carolina.  I've seen alot of what remains
of the great racism demon.  It's still there, but only as a shadow of it's
former self.  In no way does it justify the government violating the equal
protection clause.

Two wrongs make for nice "sensitivity," but they also hold the two races
apart.
