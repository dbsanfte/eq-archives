Once you get this spell never cast it on your group until you are at your zone
in point.  I joined a group the other day and it went like this:  Group was
full and GL was getting the mission.  I asked if anyone needed extended temp
because I did and would cast the group one if they did.  One guy responded that
he did and he was sitting right next to me.  Two others headed for the zone. 
So i get up and cast the group temp.  It took on 3 out of the 4 of us.  Cool. 
So we get our mission and run to the next zone.  We get to the zone in point
and the other 2 are sitting there.  The monk says he needs temp.  So I asked
why he didn't wait when I cast it before?  He said he was in /tell and hadn't
been paying attention.   So we get inside and within 10 minutes you guessed it,
the other guy was asking for temp.  About 20 minutes the last guy's virtue
faded and he wanted temp.  You can count on some variation of this scenario
happening about 1/2 the time.  
Sigh.
