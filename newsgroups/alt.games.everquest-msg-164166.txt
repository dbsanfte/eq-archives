Giggling manically and surrounded by armed hamsters,

No, I probably would have caught on eventually. But at the time I had
only been in serverwide.age a couple weeks, and you hadn't left a
million hints here either.

I'm not saying it *is* a male name. :-) Just that to the casual
observer, who probably doesn't read those sites, won't immediately
guess "female". I think its the "o" ending.

I am. So I didnt bother to change it this time.
