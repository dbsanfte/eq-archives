I recall the tunare puppet attacking me and I play a tunare cleric who
hasn't taken a single hit in PoG.

This still happens (or at least it did last time I was bound in PoM,
about a month ago). The thing is that in order to make the puppets stay
up so you can kill them you need to kill one of the audience. Otherwise
the puppets just despawn after a little while. When you have people
exping/farming the audience without killing the puppets more and more
will spawn on top of each other.
