Helping newbies travel can be fun.

I was helping some newbies get from GFay to Freeport once, and we happened
to port into WC right when a GM event was starting (werewolf invasion).
Herding several people who are not very good at "follow the wizard" through
a bunch of werewolves, in a zone that is about to crash from all the people
porting in, is interesting.

(Why does Verant hold events in a zone like WC, which has both wizard and
druid portals, and is one zone over from the main auction zone on many
servers?  It's hard to think of a zone in the game that is easier for large
numbers of people to quickly reach.  Do they forget that their zones crash
if too many people enter them?)
