  Well, what is the information for if not as a resource for roleplay?  I guess
lore has some value with regards to questing, but straight spoiler sites are a
better resource for straight questing.

  I don't really see the fact that the information is presented from an in
character (and somewhat biased) opinion as a real problem... afterall, even the
official Verant lore and histories have a bit of that.

  Maybe, but he's done a really great job of making a lot of the pieces fit
together, and makes references to a lot of other sources.  It may not be 100%
accurate, but a lot of this stuff Verant doesn't exactly spell out for us... I
think we're meant to try to fit the pieces together and make our own
interpretations, and this guy has done a terrific job of doing just that.
