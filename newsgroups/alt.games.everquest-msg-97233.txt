Exactly, "Iliketosing" is one that would get greased by a senior on
sight. And they hate having to waste time on garbage like that.

The warning comes because its assumed if you try eight or more names
all of which are violating the name guidelines you're probably trying
to bypass them. The guide lets one through, tells the player to stop
trying to evade the filter, and to delete the character. If they
refuse, then you are into warning territory. And the name will be
removed anyways.

They may be kids but they're expected to play by the same rules as
everyone else.
