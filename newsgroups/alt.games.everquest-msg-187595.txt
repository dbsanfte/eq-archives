Exactly. I do know that it was finally *fixed*, but that wasn't a ninja 
since it was announced in the patch message. Previously the wizard could 
have his/her nice, long, 45 minute levitation blown away by anyone 
casting a buff with a DS component involved on them. This could result 
in anything from annoyance to death, depending how high up you were at 
the time.
