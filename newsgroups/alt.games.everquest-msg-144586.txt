I, personally, prefer the ogre warrior shields.  The problem with
them, however, is they have low int, and thus, don't follow commands
very well.  Fortunately, I'm told warriors of other races end up
making good shields in the end game.

Good luck finding a good shield!

PS: This is a joke.  I mean no offense to those stupid ogre
meatshields.
