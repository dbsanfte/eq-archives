A while back I posted a poll on a number of class specific sites and asked
the various classes to rate their strengths and weaknesses based on a number
of different in-game aspects.  One of them was the ability to make money
with innate skills and another one was the ability to solo.  A lot of people
commented that neither of those abilities was very important to the overall
value of a class.  In fact some people objected completely to even including
making money with innate skills as having any importance whatsoever.
Soloing ability was considered to be of only medium importance, but the
greatest importance was given to how well a class stacks up on raids.

As for making money with trade skills, you don't need to umbue anything to
make money.
