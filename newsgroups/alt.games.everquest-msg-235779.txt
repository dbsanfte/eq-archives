Having played a Halfling Druid to 65, I don't have really any regrets.
The most outstanding difference as far as I can tell are the Charisma
differences. If you like to charm mobs and solo perhaps a bit more
then go Wood Elf. Otherwise I would lean more towards the halfling,
their base stats are so much better (which really does not matter if
twinked a bit). Although my druid pretty much soloed from level 1 to
60 rather easy (quad kiting rules), hence the boost in charisma really
did not matter. Yes charming a blood raven in PoN is nice but they
nerfed the heck out of the xp long ago.

Not sure about the xp angle differences play so much of a factor later
on but if you know where to go and what mobs to get that really plays
a small factor IMHO.

Misty Thicket is nice but grows old rather fast. Head to Kurns tower
(25% xp bonus?)at around 10 (if with a group) or 12 solo. You can
pretty much stay there till 17 or even low 20's if you know it well
enough (dining area nice, or basement with a necro rocks - just watch
trains). If not head over to PC and get a group, but that place is so
over camped. In the mid/upper 20's take on the giants in Warsilks
Woods at giant fort either solo or group (not great xp but loot is
nice) - also FM is nice with a group.

Good luck whatever you choose.
