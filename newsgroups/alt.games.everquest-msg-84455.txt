yes , but for me damn pally and beastmaster spells seem to drop at an
annoying frequency. Also we have killed a fair number of bosses and sub
bosses who have been particularly stingy. averaging one high level 60 spell
per pair of 60+ mobs and 75% of those have been useless pally or beatmaster.
Oddly enough havent seen remove greater curse yet .

> D) Keys to Vex Thal

So many stupid quest parts drop all over that imsure we have destroyed parts
needed for this key quest several times :p . As far as i know its still
broken.

You must have a low view of the evil them . I picture them more as down at
the local sports bar expounding commentary at great length about the
exploits of this person or that .
