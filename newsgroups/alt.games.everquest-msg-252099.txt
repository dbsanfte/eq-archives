  Have you played Rise of Nations?  I am not a huge fan of RTS's but it is
quite enjoyable for being a Civilization/RTS hybrid.

  Ubisoft or EIDOS are far more risk taking, but on the other hand Microsoft
has built up a reputation over the years of publishing polished games.
That, along with their name value, is why their games rarely get pushed to
the bargain bins quickly.

  Microsoft and EA's strategy, while not the greatest for gamers
necessarily, tends to produce companies and franchises that have staying
power.  Vivendi, on the other hand, has basicly "plundered" their IP looking
for a quick buck.
