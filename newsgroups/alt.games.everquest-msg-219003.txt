Heehee, thank you Richard...I was hoping at least one person would take
the stance of "gack, no, not a knight!" so I could get a close look at why
they say this...and having it come from a cleric is perfect.

As luck would have it, we have a 0.001% chance of ever getting to the
stages you mention we would need a warrior at.  (We are a Family Guild
With Teeth (TM)...probably looking at one Real RAid every 2 weeks or so,
with lots of 1-group dungeon crawls and mini-raids whenever needed.)  So
my friend's current preference for being able to rez and do other parlor
tricks won't hurt his status as MT.

Yay, life is good.  :) Now we just have a month of PowerLeveling to look
forward to. *gulp*
