This is almost certainly incompatible skins.  SOE made some fair-sized
changes to the UI, so your UI files need to be changed to match.  EQ will
still work with some UI errors, either giving you an out-of-date XML files
error, or reverting to the default skin.  Some errors, however, will kill EQ
and boot you to the desktop.  Sometimes you'll be booted to the desktop
whenever you zone or camp (lesser errors), and rarely, with very serious
errors, you'll be booted to the desktop as soon as you load the skin to
begin with.  Try using your default skin for all chars.  If you really like
the skin(s) you're using, post them here in a.g.e. in a zip file, and I'll
load them, fix them, and repost.
