Root has always broken easily, are you saying its happening more now
than ever?

I've seen no evidence of any change in spell fizzle rate.

I'd say Necro would be the most nerfed class... and still one of the
most powerful up thru the early 50s.

Wizzards would not be very high on the nerfed list, they've -always-
sucked, and I haven't seen much to suggest that they have gotten
any weaker.  I have found well played wizards to at least not be
a drain on a party, but I don't think this is due to Verant beefing em
up, but rather to players working hard to figure out how to make
themselves useful despite a poorly constructed class.
