I have seen something strange with the way my pet acts lately but this
was before the patch so it's in no way related to the patch.  If I have
a pet up and my brother (warrior) is fighting a mob with me and my
pet and I happen to go LD (which happens alot cause my ISP sucks)
my pet suddenly turns on my brother until it poofs (usually about
30 seconds).  But again, this has been going on for a while....pretty
strange tho.
