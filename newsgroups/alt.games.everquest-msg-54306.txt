/agree

Ranger is a great class for you.  And at the higher levels they can do
wicked damage with their arrows (course this only works once then it is
melee time for you).  Your offensive spells are weak in comparison to the
other hybrids though, and your buffs are really second rate too for the most
part... but it is definitely a very fun class to play.  My main is a cleric,
but my heart is with rangers... may have some difficulty finding groups
after level 50 though at times.
