Oh, I'm not disagreeing with the sentiment.   Don't really have an opinion
on that.

What I do take issue with is arguing your position based on "Someone you
don't know, who, trust me, is really really good at playing this class, once
mentioned in passing..."

*shrug*   I don't see many rangers rooting and soloing with bows.  And those
that are soloing don't seem to even approach the kill rate of either a
root-dot or quadding wizard / druid.   DT's claim was that they were
overpowered in soloing, because of bow usage, and arrows not breaking root.
"because his guildie told him so."

As a raid skill, it's quite a bit more powerful, IMO.  But that wasn't
really the topic of the thread.
