You can take up a trade skill, but they take a while to become 
profitable, and some are pretty complicated...

Baking might be the easiest skill to learn at an early level. I used to 
make a pretty good profit from it (30-40 pp per hour, plus an added bonus 
of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome!), but in the last patch they reduced the 
amount merchants pay for food, so I have no idea how profitable it is 
now...

Take a look at www.eqtraders.com and maybe youll find a skill that 
interests you.
