A few deaths long ago "scared" my Paladin off using this spell
for anything except the ultra-rare duel (maybe 5 per RL year,
all at guild events).  Do you really get significant mileage
out of it?  Even in outdoor zones I've fought in way too many
mobs seem social, and besides its duration is so short (I can
see using it with a soloing Shaman or Cleric to make it easier
to Gate when things go bad).
