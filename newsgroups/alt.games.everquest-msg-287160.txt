My son started this quest last year but didn't get far, ended up 
destroying the stocking.  He'd like to start again, but can't seem to 
get a new stocking to replace the one he destroyed.

I remember some of the missions for this event last  year being a lot of 
fun, even if I didn't need the rewards, and heck now that I have a 
cleric bot and my son's mage is 60, maybe I should revisit the old 
ones... looking forward to then new ones as well, even though they mean 
disrupting guild efforts to get Qvic armor and COA sigs done cause 
people will be off in nooks and crannies of Norrath doing silly 
Frostfell missions.

I don't know what that means, did I miss out on getting my SK or Cleric 
these spells?

Just removed, not replaced with something of equal utility for the class 
that can use the item?  Seems kind of lame.

Issue?  There's no issue.  Because you can skip the entire epic with the 
exception of the first step and the last step.  Its good to know that I 
wasn't helping that guy cheat the system but instead helping him work 
around a bugged epic.

OK now thats just weird, don't most mobs in the game reset their timers 
on server up?  Why this one obscure mob?

As a side note, we went and killed Shei yesterday for the first time, 
just as a lark since we had just cleared Qvic goats so we had a small 
raid formed and there was an hour before official raid time.  Tinker 
robe dropped and as the only gnome expressing an interest...

Nice for the Vah Shir leather and silk classes... ok, the leather class.

I keep hoping they'll fix the surviability of pets in general, more and 
more we're hitting targets where pets are just a joke... yes the SK pet 
is always a joke but now even beastlord/necro/mage ones are laughable.

Er, as in easier to get than before, or harder to get than before?

Again, whats properly mean?



Nothing about Unholy Aura, the discipline that continues to do nothing 
at all.
