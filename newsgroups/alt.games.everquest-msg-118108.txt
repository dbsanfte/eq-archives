Well, I just say, they're dead, so might as well not have been in
vain. Giants are my sworn enemies, so no issue there, and coldain skin
and gnome skin armors? I get those by killing people who have killed
coldain and gnomes and are my enemies.
Anyway, I don't have any plans about quadding othmir (my buddies!),
but what do you think those fezes are made of?

You would never catch me wearing Nature Walkers leathers, though. That
would mean aligning with the giants who are fighting my goddess. Tsk.

Nice stuff, I didn't have that much wis till I got my gloves at level
55 :) (Well, ok, I did, but I usually lost 10 wis by not wearing wis
tunic and pants due to looks)
Your resists are kind of meager, but so were mine at that level.
And, I can't really think of any upgrades you could buy or get without
at least a miniraid, especially since you want to raise your wis.
Shield of Bane Warding?

Allakhazam's is just fine. I had an old user account so I cooked up a
profile of my own (I can't seem to be able to set my tradeskills and
stuff, though, probably because I am not premium)

Kinda weird how they let you put up how much money you have, but can't
put your AC.
