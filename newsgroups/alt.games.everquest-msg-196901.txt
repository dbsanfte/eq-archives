    So it allows clerics with lesser skill to still come out as effective as
clerics that pay full attention. Bad clerics don't get better because they
never have to, second boxes are more than playable - as a cleric main you
find this a good thing? You're happy with people thinking a chimp could play
your class because, after all, you can second box clerics on raids and
they're just as good as a real cleric, right? You honestly believe that
being able to fine tune a heal to tenths of a second means anything when
human reaction time still throws a random 0.5 to 1 second blip in when a
spell is cast?

    Without /pause, someone has to judge when the appropriate amount of time
has passed before healing. During that interval they have to pay attention
to the cleric - try to do something else and you'll likely lose track of
time. With /pause and "Hit your CH key now" messages, a cleric just has to
see the "go now" message and hit their hotkey. That requires a lot less
effort. It dumbs down what we do. That is bad. Never mind how inflexible a
/pause command can make a CH hotkey.
