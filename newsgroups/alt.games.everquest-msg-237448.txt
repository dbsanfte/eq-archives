From the shadows, the mysterious Bebinn <1bebinn1@1msn1.1.com1> (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

On test, theres a fairly sizable community that testbuffs, goes red,
and PvPs all day in GFay. Seems to be a fairly sizable number of
people, too. Definately not normal test inhabitants; they behave like
only proddies can behave.

Not sure how in the world that got started. It seemed to have sprung
up without any of the normal test community noticing it at first. But
its definately a standard thing these days - gfay, lots of red people,
lots of moronic shouts, and lots and lots and lots of corpses strewn
everywhere around the lifts and the pok bok.
