At present, I'm thinking that the beetle eye quest(turn in 10 eyes
combined in a box), which still nets me almost 2 mini-bubbles per
turn-in, is not a bad way to earn exp for the rest of this level and the
next level or 2.  The problem is, the container you have to combine them
in is 'no-drop lore'.  So, with the other 4 containers I have, of
various sizes, by the time I have enough eyes to make 2 turn-ins, I'm
having to start dropping items that I could otherwise sell for money for
food, etc.

I was thinking that if I could get 3 10-slot containers to fill the
remaining inventory slots, I could carry and extra 20 beetle eyes and
all the extra loot.  I could make each trip to town a 4 turn-in trip. 
Plus, later on, the 10 slot containers are just handy to have.

If there's no 10 slot containers in the Dark Elf city, or nearby, I'll
just have to be satisfied with 3 8-slot tool boxes.  (The tool boxes are
cheaper than the backpacks and weigh the same.)
