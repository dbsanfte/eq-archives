I try not to train people at zonelines too, but they are basically putting
themselves into the situation by hunting there. A classic example is the
zone to dsp from me. Some hunt in the corridor, get trained and whine.
Others hunt a bit south of the zoneline and avoid the trains.

Also if training zone is something you do a lot, make a hotkey. Theres
several banks of them.
