If it is the stamina bar that you are worrying about then just make sure 
that you are over 100 Sta. Strength wont help unless this sword is so heavy 
that you are encumbered by carrying it and your armour.

Get gear with AC, AC, AC, HP&Sta, AC, AC, AC, I think I have the order 
right there. Perhaps you should look for some more AC items too.

There is a soft cap on AC but I dont think that you are going to hit it 
sub-40.
