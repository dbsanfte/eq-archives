I wish I was that organized. I had a friend who played EQ til he was level
58, I think, and he was much the samn way. I always admired it and wanted to
learn more about strategy. I read as much as possible on a character before
and after I create one, and I do know -something- about tactics. As for
going into places with no guards, I suppose I'll have to take that bridge
when I come to it.
