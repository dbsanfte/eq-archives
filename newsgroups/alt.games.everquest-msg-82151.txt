Not potential life. A potential human. Of course it's "alive" in some of
the biological senses, just like the epithelial cells in your
toothbrush. But neither is viable alone. Potential to be a functional
human.

Some fetuses are actively growing. What are they if they aren't growing,
as in the examples given? Are they then not human? Not life?

Unique *means* distinct. Um, *exactly* like the foot in the previous
analogy. It was the foot of an involuted twin that was being discussed -
with unique DNA. And what would a cloned human be? Identical DNA with
the donor - does that make it not human?

What does "100% life" mean? You're confusing a couple ideas here. A
fetus is not yet a viable human and as such is only a collection of
active cells - from a biological viewpoint. From a cultural viewpoint,
we have as a species, generally decided that there is an ethical
question about dealing with a *human* fetus that is different than
dealing with the fetuses of other creatures.

They're two different discussions. In the matter of biology, your
emotional points are irrelevant. In the matter of culture, they are
where they belong, but are stated in such loaded terms as to signal a
proclamation rather than a discussion.
