And the point of this game would be?

Heh since my char screen is full Im limited to 7 different classes +
one mule and my Bard is my current favorite tied with the Monk. And
one day soon the nerf bat may well swing on bards and not just by
accident next time. This isnt about class envy heck I like all of em
but one  I try very hard to misspell every chance I get. But thats
just cause I dont like theifs and rouges.

End game abilities are a good reason to play a class but I was not
really bitching about the wizzie nerf, least the AA points come back.
But the nerf coming for monks really has the potential foul up a whole
class to the core. 

The Monk/Mag nerf strike at the heart of how the end game has to be
played given the way verant has set it up. So we have to wait and see
but from the wording its gonna hurt bad and not just at high levels.
Heh was a lot of monk equipment in the bazaar last night, wonder why?

The whole point is VI can and does negate the work and time invested
in chars seemingly at random and often without warning. I mean why
change monks? Not like a group of 6 monks show up and take out dragons
or anything. Only place monks tank is in the lower end game or some
uber guild, or by accident . Ah well so who next?

Oh and DT you are so witty man you ma hero...
