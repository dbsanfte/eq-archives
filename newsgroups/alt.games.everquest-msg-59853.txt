Allakhazam'c has it at 2200 plus, EQPrices at 1500 (14 reports).  In my
experience, Allkhazam's is more accurate and EQprices is high.  Looking at
the data on Alla, though, I see 2 of of the 12 sales are absurdly high (10k
and 9k), 1 absurdly low (200pp), the rest average out to about 900pp (8k ttl
for 9 sales).  Based on both sets, you overpaid (probably by a lot).  Find
an EBay-idiot to sell to.
