<snip snip snip>

My recollection on how this works if there is no one around to say

"hey this is our camp"

it is open for all.

There is a way around this, have one of the folks who can cast bind, cast
bind
on themselves a short (beyond aggro) distance from where you are, and they
pop back there on death.  they can be the lone testament to the sacrifice
and ensuing corpse run.

Regards,

John
