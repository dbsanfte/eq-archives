I would suggest doing Severilous first as he is by far the easiest one. 
With a few Poison resist gear items and DMF you can get your resist high 
enough so that he's not much of an issue and he doesn't have many HP 
compared to the others.

Gore, OTOH, is one of the toughest dragons there are (unless you are uber 
65s with good gear). Her slow is a major PITA and she is kind of a crap 
shoot. One time you might do really well and kill her with little problem 
and the next she will own you for no apparent reason.

Talendor and Faydedar are also fairly easy. Talendor is like a beefed up 
Ragefire and more people usually die from his DoT after the fight is over 
than die during the actual fight.

Trakanon is a fun fight, but the big learning factor on him is how to deal 
with the Juggs and having the DPS to kill him before all the tanks get 
banished. He's easy to do now days if you have level 65 chars, but I'm 
thinking your guild must be mostly mid-50s based on the fact that you 
haven't done Kunark dragons yet.
