The thing is I'm not sure that the server knows when you have not
loaded the zone really until you actually show up, its very client
side. This is why when you teleport someone you see them grayed out
(they are still not quite in the zone) but if you do /who all
theirname it shows them as being in the zone. You see them in the zone
pretty much right when they show up but I thnk what you suggest would
entail continually checking on their status when a tell is sent which
would probably make for more overhead. The server is not even up on
you zoning at the same time as you are to the point where sometimes to
the server you "die" so you still zone and are not dead but all your
buffs are stripped and you might be at the safe point of the zone, its
like the server says "died in combat" then once you successfully zone
it says "oh, no they didn't" 

I'm guessing this is the same reason why what you suggest would not
work; the server is not continually checking on your status but finds
out AFTER the fact since the continual checking would be overhead. I
mean multiply it by 2,000 people playing at once, "has X player zoned
yet? no has X player zoned yet? No"

Yeah but see above (about more overhead) This would REALLY add more
overhead because ALL guild chat would have to be buffered on their
servers. Guild chat in general slows things down which I think is
exactly why they did that thing where if your guild has less than 10
active members its disbanded.

Both of these circumstances are taken care of by the players anyway in
the following ways:

"I just zoned."

"What? i zoned if anyone said something."
