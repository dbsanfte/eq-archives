I managed to complete Tipt at level 65 wearing a mixture of pre VT Ssra 
gear, and tier 1 PoP gear, without any charming of any mobs involved.  
Tipt is the only require flag to enter KT, although, at the time, it was 
not.  Our tank was a Time level raid geared Paladin, the rest of the 
group was a mixture of people with about my level of gear, and raid 
geared folks.  This does not help a tank get the flag much, but, the 
other classes do not need raid level gear to do Tipt without resorting to 
charming.

As mentioned above, you really only need the tank to be raid geared for 
this to work, alternatively, you can still use the charm method quite 
successfully, albeit with significantly reduced DPS from what you had 
before.

See above.
