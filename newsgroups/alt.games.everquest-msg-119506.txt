  I just tested this with my shadow knight.  Usually I feign using a social
that turns off autoattack, pauses for a fraction of a second, then casts the
spell.  I haven't had any problems getting attacked after a successful feign
when using this social in 20 levels of feigning.

  I just tried feigning using the normal spell gem while leaving autoattack
on, and twice I feigned successfully, and twice I continued to get attacked
by my target.  It did say that autoattack was turned off after I feigned,
but I kept getting attacked.  Apparently there is some lag time sometimes
between when it shuts off autoattack for you, and when you actually feign...
at least with the spell version of FD.
