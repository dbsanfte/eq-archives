   I was kinda wondering about this too.  It seems to me like our friend
is saying "I like playing a druid best, it is easy for me, and if you
don't have as easy a time of it then you are a moron".  
  Well, fine.  You're the expert.  Thanks for setting us straight.  
  I think that the easiest class for anyone to play is the class that
they enjoy the most.  It's just easier to play, and to level, when
you're having fun.  For some it is a druid.  For others a cleric or
monk.   I had a bear of time playing an enchanter to level 12, and hated
it.  Slowest exp I ever, ever got.  Would have taken me 15 years to get
to level 40.  And yet I see level 60 enchanters running around!  I must
be a colossal moron,  since I couldn't level as easily as they obviously
did!
