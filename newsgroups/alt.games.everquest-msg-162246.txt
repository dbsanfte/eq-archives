And just how long do you think it's taking a Ranger to shoot down
a rooted mob with arrows?  Dennis compared a single kill to a quad.
How long are you gonna take to recover from a quad? (not how long to
med empty to full, how long to be ready again after a typical quad).

If root is breaking every couple shots you've just hugely increased
the time it takes to kill, and added a lot of downtime besides.  So
you're saying the Ranger should have more trouble killing a low blue
than a Druid has with much tougher mob?
