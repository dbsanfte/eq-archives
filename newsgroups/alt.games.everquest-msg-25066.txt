There should be a rule that a level 20+ that act so stupid should be
permanently banned from any internet use, since he probably only know Eq
and EBay. *s*

Personally my druid got from level 24-28 in 4 days. 2 of the days i only
played around 1 hour each. Earned around 400pp in loot and FS weapons
too.
