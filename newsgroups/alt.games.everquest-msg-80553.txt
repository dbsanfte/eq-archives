I hunted cazic a lot in my mid 30's, 31-37 or so I think, and what
you want to do is get an enchanter, go to the pyramid/ziggurat off
the maze, get to the top, get a sowwed puller and have them collect
2 levels of the ziggurat at a time, pull em back , mez em up like
an a'la carte dinner selection, and keeeeel them.

Crusaders spawn all over the pyramid, and also in the corridors and
rooms above the Tae Ew throne room. (Take the door on the left
behind the tree if you're facing in from the Feerott zone hall).

These are probably safer than the sewers, as the crocs and golems
can be pretty mean, but its a while since I hunted there and if
you're all pushing 39 you can probably handle it ;)

Sui, who actually pulled the entire pyramid, and floor several
times, with particularly good enchanters.
