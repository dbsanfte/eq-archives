In other words, to offer up materials that are already available in a much
easier to access format (web pages) but through an archaic protocol (telnet),
meaning the users would have to learn a completely new, text-based internet
access mode to use it.

Sure, another old-style MUD/MUSH/whatever would be nice, but there are hundreds
out there, even web pages that review and rate them. And BBSes died for a reason
- they are much harder for the average user to use, and there are few standards
(and those that there were, were in heavy competition, almost to the point of
violence).

In other words, yes, it has been done, and done to death.

Not to be critical, but "them's the facts".

Cheers :)
