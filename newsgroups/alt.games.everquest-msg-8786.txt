Which means that you are mixing two roles.  Tank and Bulldog.  The Tank's
job is to keep the attention of all involved mobs.  He shifts targets as
required.  The Bulldog's job is to work on the designated target.  He
doesn't change targets (barring an add that becomes the new designated
target).  Everyone should be assisting the Bulldog.  The Bulldog should
ordinarily be your top damage dealer.  Rogues and monks make good bulldogs.
Warriors make good tanks.

This scheme is appropriate for enchanter-less fighting.  With an enchanter,
things change.

Don't Attack The Enchanter's Mob.

The chanter can deal with it himself.  He's got stun and mez.  And the
last thing he needs is some yahoo coming in and busting his mez just
as he finally gets it to stick.

Correct.  Big heal spell beats a taunt every time.

And now you've got the mob beating on a character who can take some
damage.  More importantly, it's not beating on the enchanter.  Which
means that the enchanter can get his mez off.

As Dan said, saving the cleric's life is the enchanter's job.

But... That's Not Your Job.  That's the enchanter's job.  Let him do it.
Taunting a MOB that's going to get mezzed or which has already been mezzed
is a waste of time.  (Unless, of course, the current designated target
goes down and the new designated target is mezzed.  Your enchanter will
be grateful for a little pre-taunting in that case).
