These spells are VASTLY different.

Harmony has the sole purpose of pulling- mez is primarily crowd control 
(although it can semi-reliably split pulls on blue mobs). Harmony you cast 
before a fight, whereas mez really shines during a fight when you get adds. 
Basically get all of your melees and offensive casters focused on ONE 
monster (targeting one person (the "Main Assist", usually the puller) and 
hitting a /assist hotkey) and then you can effectively stop time for the 
additional monsters. 

Say you have three melees, a healer, and you. The monsters come in, three 
of them. Without mez, you effectively have 3 simultaneous 1 on 1's with a 
bit of back row support from the casters. With mez used properly, you have 
three consecutive 3-on-1 fights, which are much better for everyone. 

If the mobs all have, say, 300 hit points, and each of your melees does 10 
damage per round(assuming all delays are 10 or something, just evenly 
spread across the board for this example). Now assume that the monsters 
also hit for 10 with a delay of 10. 

Without mez and everyone taking their own mob, the mobs will deal 900 
points of damage to your party. 

Without mez and everyone taking the same mob, the mobs will deal 600 points 
of damage to your party.

With mez and everyone taking the same mob, the mobs will deal 300 points of 
damage to your party.

As you can see, this is definitely preferable. Add to this the fact that 
sometimes you will get MUCH more dangerous mobs (IE casters- offensive 
spells and heals) with the warrior-types, and mez should ALWAYS be 
memorized. And I mean also.

It is also helpful if bad things happen in the middle of nowhere far from 
zone. An enchanter, with Mez and Memory Blur, can say "I wish I had not 
gotten into this fight" and actually remove themselves from it, without 
having to zone and without being on the monsters hate list.
