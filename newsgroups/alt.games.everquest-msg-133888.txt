I *did* buy actually, I saw someone auctioning it for I thought was a decent
price, sent them a tell and I bought it. I *do* want the spell but as I've
mentioned I'm desperately saving my cash for an item I've wanted for ages
now. I simply want my item more than I want the spell, nothing wrong in
that, many people buy things and then end up by selling them on. I can buy
the spell again at a later date, I can still Levitate even if I do use bat
wings. I just wanted to know the spell duration before I scribed this
seemingly valuable spell. Is it worth me scribing, probably not.

Thank you for the information though.

Regards,

Stevie.
