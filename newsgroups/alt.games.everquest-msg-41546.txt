Well you already asked 4 level 60 monks, and that wasn't enough?

I have played 2 monks; one I went with all STA, one I went all STR.
Under level 30, there was no appreciable difference. I'd suggest going
all STA if you plan on playing this char to 50+.

Of course, with a level 60 cleric powerlevelling you, it doesn't make a
damn bit of difference. Put all your points into CHA.
