OK  If this doesn't need to be replied to, then I won't reply to it...





Other then to say that you are dead on balls accurate.  And, as I
explained to RS, it shows the hypocracy of Lesa's postings...
She wants people to believe she is the perfect angel Rose, who lives
in a rose-colored where her kids are all genuises and lecture to
Stephen Hawking about the Theories Of All and she is soo good...

Yet, when lil ol' EQ comes along and shows her that her virgin snow
has a few tire tracks thru it, she proves that she get's as nasty as
anyone else..

Which is all fine and good if she would just acknowledge.. But the she
tries to lie and bluster her way thru it by dodging the issue at every
turn...


But you said this post didn't need replying to, so I won't reply to
it..   :^)
