I played EQ for years and in the end the direction they took EQ in of 
raiding (like having a freakin second job) and the evolving attitude of 
them stooping to take my soloing slacker money was why I left when WoW 
opened. Somehow SOE just couldn't understand that someone might want to 
go around, explore, fight monsters, casually interact with friends, and 
occasionally drop buffs on and save other people who had bit off more 
than they could chew.  Blizzard (WoW) seems to hve gotten that.  I play a 
pally who actually "gasp" hold his own in a fight and rescue people in 
trouble.

By the way, for the earlier thread on numbers, mmorpgcharts.com hasn't 
been updated yet reflect the china launch of WoW.  The subscription 
numbers are now in the 3.5 million range.

WoW is shallower than EQ right now but Blizzard is expanding the PvP 
areas and has made improvements to the UI without charging us for an 
expanison.  I'm sure when they do release the expansion it will once 
again set the new industry standard.
