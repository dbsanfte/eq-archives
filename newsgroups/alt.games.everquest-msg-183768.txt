--------------------------------------------
Here is some minor help in getting the new Heal spell for sham lvl 44 w/o
giving it totaly away.



(Hint #1)  u talk to the sea spirit <-- easyier to find with an euduring
breath item

(Hint #2) He gives u a riddle to solve, Not Hard if you are Observent<--
look closely

(Hint #3) Based on what you think the item is,(if u figured it out) search
for a matching name.


Hope this helps those who wish to solve a quest w/o it acaully being ruined.
