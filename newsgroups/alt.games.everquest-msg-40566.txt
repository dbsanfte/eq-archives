I'll just comment on the warriors, since that is what I play.

Much lower.  All warriors have is rate of attack and the button.   Other
classes usually get faster weapons, and the button isn't that great.  Almost
any melee class is able to taunt things off the warrior if they try.  The
challenge is getting them to understand that they generally shouldn't try.

Eh.  Throw in a 2 handed weapon.  The warrior will become near invisible,
without damaging melee output too seriously.

Lower.   Warriors do only average damage.   And if we're using our defensive
discipline, that average damage goes down to just above "dead in the water".
Don't get overly impressed by the criticals - they're flashy, but
insignificant in the grand scheme of things.   Too rare to count for much.

I'd say this should be a 1 or so.  I've seen a warrior with a ToD slow mobs
that the shaman was having no luck on.
