Cease is far and away the absolute best spell Paladin gets in the first
to spell circles.  Even against mobs that ignore stuns (most giants,
for example) stuns are still good for gaining agro, and Cease only costs
15 mana and is castable between swings.  I don't know if that is true
with mobs that are "immune to the stun effect of your spell", they
might not give a damn whether you throw a stun at them or not.

Oh, and the L15 Desist stun lasts longer than Cease, but it is slower
casting (1.8 sec) and that 0.3 second seems to make a big difference,
so I hardly ever have it mem'd.  It's cool to be able to load up five
stuns tho, now I need to find a fight where it's necessary. :)
