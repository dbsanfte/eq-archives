I killed a few Orc Pawns in West Commons and these are the faction hits:
Your faction with Death Fist Orcs Got worse!
Your faction with Death Fist Orcs Got better!
Your faction with Death Fist Orcs Got better!
Your faction with Death Fist Orcs Got better!
Your faction with Death Fist Orcs Got better!
