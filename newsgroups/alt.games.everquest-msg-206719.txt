Nope, go to the SOE everquest site and the password verification
area. They ask for one of the CD codes from your EQ cdroms to 
verifty your account, then you can change the password.

The simplest way is if your idiot brother did not change the
registration email, then the new code will be sent to the email
address you provided.


"If you have forgotten your password, please visit our Password
Recovery Page at
https://www2.station.sony.com/secure/en/retrieve/password.jsp. You
will be asked to fill out a form and your reset password will be
emailed to you at the email address you provided during registration.
In order for us to send you your new password, you will need the
following information when you fill out the form:

Your Station Name
Your ZIP/Postal Code
Your Birthdate (mm/dd/yy)

After you receive your new password, we strongly suggest that you
visit https://www.station.sony.com/secure/en/registration/view.jsp,
sign in, and change your password to something unique that only you
will know. We also suggest that after you have changed your password,
you write down your Station Name and password for future reference"
