Fired up a new character over the weekend, a Halfling Cleric.  I'm up to 5
now, and rather enjoying it.  Got all my spells for the level, full set of
leather gear, and a nice velium staff from my little bro.  What sort of
stuff should I be doing right now?  Should I be grouping yet, or is soloing
still the best option?  Where should I be hunting?  Should I stick in the
Thicket, or head over to EC?

More importantly, can any experienced Clerics offer some tips on playing the
class?  Both for my present level, and for the future?

Thanks.
