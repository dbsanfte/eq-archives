A few days ago, a discussion gave a Microsoft thread regarding memory over
512MB with Windows 98.

At the time, it didn't bother me as I didn't have the specs needed to be
affected by it.  I've now upgraded my system and think I'm being hassled by
the limitations.

Could someone please post the thread address?  All help gratefully received.
