I've found a new online game that only just started. It doesn't take
long to play each day (no advantage to those who log on for hours) and
its designed to help newcomers catch up quickly. Just click on
 http://www.savagearena.net/friend.cgi?by=QCO10505

It's free to join, easy to learn, you can join an alliance, make your
own alliance with friends, or just fight alone. Join now while its
only just started!

You can beat the crap out of your mates in duels either one on one or
en mass!!!

If you don't like it, you dont lose anything.
Give it a go!

It feels good beating up people you know!!!! LOL

It's worth a good look anyway!
