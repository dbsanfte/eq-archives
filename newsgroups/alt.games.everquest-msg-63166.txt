Does anybody else have a problem with the reverb going bananas in a few
locations (Feerott, bank in Rivervale, many tunnels) and starting a
shrieking feedback loop? It only happens occasionally, but it's really
annoying. I wonder if there is a way to turn reverb off, but leave
surround sound on... There is a driver update for SB Live! for XP on the
Microsoft site, but since the sound more or less works now, I'm
disinclined to mess with it.
