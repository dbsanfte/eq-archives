My druid partner soloed the camp quite happily with only occaisional
pleas for me to come rez her, in fact I eventually brought my 34 druid
in to camp in her safe spot and got him several pieces of her duplicate
equipment, since its no drop it was just going to rot.

Her spot was in, to the right, and past the rock guys in a corner, I've
literally gone afk for an hour in that corner (in an empty zone) and
not had an aggro, and never saw her get an add while root/DOT
kiting there.

She was 58 when she started there, 59 for the latter half of it, had
epic, as well... so maybe a partner would be in order if you are
55 and don't have epic.

Cavemen types near the zone aren't the target mobs, they are
largely useless for this question.  Find a druid who is already
doing the camp, and get some pointers. Since the exp sucks, you
won't have to wait too long to inherit the camp, or heck,
you could partner with him for training purposes and claim
only the parts he already has.
