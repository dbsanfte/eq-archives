Get a Tivo.  Seriously.  It will change the way you watch TV.

Been watching a lot of TV lately (http://www.cws.org/~moira/joemoira5.jpg),
and it's great to be able to stop the show when I need to pay attention to
the kid.  Plus, I never have to worry about missing shows that I like.  Just
tell Tivo about them, and they show up like magic.
