Damn it, I can't tell if you're whining or not, so I can't accuse
you of being a whiner!

Clearly, EQ needs a new class.  Whiner.  It should have all the
best skills and abilities of all the other classes rolled into
one.

This would facilitate unheard of reams of whining from every
other class in the game.  This would be followed by the Whiners
telling the whiners to stop whining and just play a Whiner
instead.

Then, every patch, the Whiner class should be nerfed hard.

This would facilitate whines (verb) from the Whiners (noun).
This would be followed by the whines from the non-Whiners
telling the Whiners to stop whining.

And then Kaev would post something pointlessly offensive.
But he does that anyway, so no change there.
