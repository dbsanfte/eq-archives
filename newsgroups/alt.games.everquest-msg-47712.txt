So? Tracking in PoG is not exactly rocket science.

Since most druids put out NO damage in PoG, this is a pointless advantage.
Plus, having to shift group composition around to get people in with the
wizard is pointless, distracting, and time consuming.

But you travel better than a cleric, shaman, mage, or necro.

You damage shield better than a cleric, wizard, shaman or necro

You mana regen better than a cleric, wizard, or mage...shamans and necros
too, if you discount their abilities for being self-only.

Trying to point out flaws in your class by bumping yourself up against the
main strengths of a specialist proves exactly nothing. A common arguement
about velious is that all you need are clerics, warriors, and
rogues...well:

rogues can't take hits like warriors, and can't heal like clerics so they
suck
warriors can't heal like clerics, and do less damage than rogues, so they
suck.
clerics can't hit anything, can't take hits like warriors, and can't avoid
being hit like rogues, so they suck.

In a generic "open slot" on any raid, there is no overpowering reason to
put ANY class there. If you want to argue specific raids and specific raid
compositions, fine...but you can make those same arguements to any class,
even the "essentials"...a raid of 36 people does not need 10 clerics.
