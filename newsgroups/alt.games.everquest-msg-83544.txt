Or more likely the corporate way of getting rid of visionaries who refuse 
to be sheep and follow the corporate philosophy.  Very few visionaries 
can stay in a stable company, nothing for them to do, and the company 
starts making changes based on customer input, which in many cases are 
diametrically opposed to the vision the visionary had in the first place.
