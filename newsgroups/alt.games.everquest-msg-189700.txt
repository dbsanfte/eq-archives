I'd focus on sta primarily, followed by str and wis evenly. The rest
aren't much to worry about...

>2) How do you re-charge magic items (mojo sticks)?

Most charged items can't be recharged. A few tinkered items can be by
adding a new mana battery. A couple other items I think have quests to
recharge them. But, in general, once they charges are gone, they're
gone for good.

Lake of Ill Omen, Aviaks in SKarana and Lake Rathe, Unrest. SolA, I
think? Nowhere will match the xp bonus of Paludal by a long shot,
though.
