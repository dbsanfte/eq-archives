Yeah, always watch out for this.  I had a double death in Kedge
(wipe-out after killing Phinny[1], then nuked by two seahorses that hadn't
pathed back on the CR) -- The cleric was _adamant_ that they had
rezzed each corpse once, but after asking them to rez both corpses
again ... well, as if by magic, I had the XP back ;)
