I'll use the lowest aggro spell of all, since I'm playing my warrior
on test these days. I'll use a bow if I have to, though I was hoping I
could just run up and whack one and not get the next pair behind it.

I tried that at 44 and what a disaster that was. I think I got half
the elementals in the dungeon. Haha! I had furball there to pull me
out, and was half expecting trouble anyways, so no damage done.

On test nowhere is crowded. Except Paludal I guess. And the tier two
pop zones. I don't anticipate problems, but I am going alone. 50
warrior and 40 druid on one computer (so no fancy moves).
