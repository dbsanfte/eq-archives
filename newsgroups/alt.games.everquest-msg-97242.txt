What an idiot, Dude u cant l-l@x0r evercrack dont be lame if you can
possibly help it. On the minute chance that you decide to go actually buy it
from the store you will see the account key however I encourage that you NOT
buy everquest. The real people who play everquest on this newsgroup have
problems with n00bs like you. Believe me your intelligence will be widely
known as soon as you start playing the game, watch out this guy will prolly
an ebay account and lose all of the characters phat lewtz then come on here
and gripe about losing all his gear and begging new gear.
