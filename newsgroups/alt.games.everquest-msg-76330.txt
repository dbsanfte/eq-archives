Although this effect is visible... it is an illusion, like the one that causes
real life alcoholics to die of hyperthermia while feeling "warmed" by
the alcohol lowering their body temperature.

If your wis is lowered, your mana pool is lowered.  Yes, a mana
pool half the size of your regular one regens to full twice as fast...
but "full" is only half your regular mana pool!

So there you sit, drunk as a monkey, unable to cast because you
are wobbling so, and when you -do- manage to cast, each of
your spells seems to eat twice the mana it used to!

As you recover wis, your mana pool does not automatically fill
in, instead you must regen the mana normally till you hit your new
pool max level.

This won't be visible with low AT, as you'll sober up more slowly
than mana regen, but with high AT its quite noticable.

For an easier demonstration, remove all your mana/wis gear,
then put it all back on.  If you started at FM before removing
items, you'll be amazed to see that ten seconds later, having
cast nothing at all, you are now at 50M!

Alcohol does the same thing, only you can't put the "gear" back
on as quickly.
