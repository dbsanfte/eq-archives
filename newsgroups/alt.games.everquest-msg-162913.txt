Not likely.   Unless you are talking about soloing  an untwinked player.
(And really, soloers get little sympathy from this warrior) For 5000 pp, you
can afford 62 SoW potions at 80 per shot.   You dont' need SoW if you're in
a group, unless there is no shaman, no druid, no ranger, no beastlord, and
you're pulling.    You don't need it in dungeon situations.   Actually, you
don't need it in so many situations, there would probably be times I'd
wonder why I'm bothering lugging the potions about.

Then by all means buy it.   You're paying for the convenience of it, and you
know that.   If he wants to do a little work rather than paying extra, he
definitely has that option.

Later he'll have to upgrade it anyways, and he will have spent 5k of cash,
which you say above he probably doesn't have, on a no drop item that has no
further use.

So gate, med up and remember to click your boots before beginning kiting
next time.   Or if you're a melee, die, get rezed by the cleric.  (Cause
since nobody is casting sow in the group, obviously you have a cleric
healing you) and remember to click them before you go out on a pull this
time.

Pre 50, I can count the number of times I was dispelled on a pull in an
outdoor zone on the fingers of one hand.   Hell, you could probably throw
the post 50 levels in there too and come up with the same result.

Oh don't get me wrong, I own a pair of T-boots on my rogue.   I knew I was
paying extra for the convenience of it, and went ahead with the purchase.

It's not the cost thats the issue when comparing to T-boots, it's finding
someone that is willing to sell a MQ of it, when you're ready to buy it.
Your hypothetical buyer is too lazy to hit the bazaar for SoW potions every
few days...  how likely is he going to be to auction for days on end to buy
a J-boots multiquest, when he can run pick up T-boots for the same price...
