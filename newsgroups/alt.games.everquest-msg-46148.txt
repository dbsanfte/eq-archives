When you kill something ld the body poofs so no loot :p

What should really be done is they should increase the caster ld abilities
to the point where the average caster avatar and the ld caster npc where
equivalent . It would mean that trivial mobs no longer killed ld casters
while letting only incompetent cheaters get a benifit from going ld
intentionally.
