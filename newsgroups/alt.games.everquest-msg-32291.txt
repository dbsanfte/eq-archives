I've run into this sometimes in groups.  Hard to really say where the
problem really resides.  Is the puller going nuts and overpulling
routinely.  He shoulldn't be bringing back more than the group can
handle.  Puller should be aware of group status and not be pulling
multiple reds constantly.  But then every so often things just go bad
and you have to deal as best you can.

Tanks should be the focus of aggro.  My main is a wiz and I seldom
have the rage of the mob on me because I try and nuke em gently.  I
seldom use my best nukes unless I'm sure it's gonna kill em outright.
But every once in a while that fails too and I'm looking at a good
beating.  I expect the tanks to pull the mobs off me but I also keep a
personal area damage and stun spell loaded to defend myself.  I also
have a hotkey set to let the group know I'm in trouble.  I don't stand
in the middle of the fight.  I cast and med from back away from the
front line of the fight.  I'm generally out of sight of the tanks. In
mid battle it's sometimes hard for the tanks to know everything going
on around them and behind them.  But, yes, if a mob they can see
suddenly starts running from their field of view they should at least
take a peek at where it's going.  Odds are really good they've decided
to snack on the back line people that are easier to chew on.

Anyway..... that's the consensus of thinking from all the voices in my
head..
