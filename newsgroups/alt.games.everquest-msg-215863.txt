Hmmm. That sounds right in line with regular broadband. Tell me, what 
technology is the wireless? Is it some sort of hotspot (802.11b) or 
something more exotic like celluar 1x.

Hotspot connections appear to sport similiar pricing as wired broadband, 
but range is limited, and you can't be mobile. 1x is through the 
cellular infrasructure, and at least here, is prohibitively expensive 
for bandwidth.
