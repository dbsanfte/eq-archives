I definatly agree in principle. I started a necro before SB opened (on
Drinal) and managed to have 100pp in the bank at level 9, with all my
spells and full armour, so I know the value of hunting there. However
the trains on FV and the sheer number of people makes it (IMHO)
somewhere between impossible and suicide for a level 5 enchanter. All of
the easiest mobs near the zone line are constantly either dead or caught
up in a train that has much harder mobs in it. Which means that I can't
kill anything and I get run over :-(

I imagine that if I could either get to level 8 or get a full group we
could just about survive quick raids, i.e. run in take out a few mobs
then dive back through the zone line. Ho humm.

I recon that this is probably the best bet however.

Jim
