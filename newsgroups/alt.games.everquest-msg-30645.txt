    So true. If I'm casting CHeal, it means we NEED mana efficiency for some
reason, and it's a sign of a problem.

    I don't see groups die from "cleric OOM" nearly as often as I see them
die from "WTF happened? Where did those ten mobs come from?" at high level.
Everyone has learned what they can and cannot pull out by then, and usually
it's easy to withdraw from a controlled situation.

    I dispute this. It MIGHT allow an enchanter more time before they get
desperate mezzing - enchanters, your comments. But Rune means diddly squat
to my ability to save them, because I don't even consider healing until
their life starts to drop. If a mob is swinging at an enchanter but their
life isn't dropping, I likely don't even KNOW they're being hit. So Rune
doesn't change my reaction time to damage an enchanter is taking. If
anything, it might mislead me - if a mob is tagging the ENCH for 300 per
round, and the Rune eats 200 before dropping, for the first few seconds I'm
going to underestimate the rate at which the enchanter is dying and possibly
attempt a heal that's too slow, like Divine Light.

>Another area that's been overlooked is the cleric's stun ability.  We seem

    It's the damage components on our stuns - gives the mob a second chance
to resist, essentially. Some high level clerics load only Stun and Stun
Command for this reason.

    Move to behind the fatty, facing his back, press F8. If you get a mob
with a changing life total, you have your man. That's assuming you didn't
target it as the pulls came in. Alternately, target the main tank and
/assist off him. If you're looking for off-mobs, get the tanks to slide the
mob to one side, or if you're the cleric move it there yourself with a large
stun's knockback effect.

    Try to move between the enchanter and the mob you wish to mez after you
stun it. Gives you a better chance of catching the aggro, which means the
mob is as good as asleep.
