I'll get it for you - promise.  I've downloaded the thing several times
since it released on 10/26 (around 9.2 mb or something) doing the Windows
Update/Creative update flipflop oh about 3 times now.

Unfortunately the Creative site is *terribly* taxed right now and has been
since the release of those drivers.  If you have an Audigy card it looks
like those are due late November.

Anyway, stay tuned.
