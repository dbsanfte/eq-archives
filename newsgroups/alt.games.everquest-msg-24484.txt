When I first started playing EQ it was really fun and exciting as a totally
ignorant newbie. As I gained some levels I set a few goals for myself and my
character. I wanted to do both Dragons, Vox and Naggy. I wanted to go to the
planes and see the gods.

Fighting dragons, facing powerful sorcerors, battling gods, seeking
treasures. This is what the game is about. Any really good RPG would have
this as a goal. I thought once I get to about level 50 I could do those
things. Well u can to an extent. Around 45 they might let you go on a dragon
raid, and of course there is a level 46 cap for the Planes, though that is a
level right after a hell level where you would lose a ton of xp when you
die, and you will die if u go to the planes.  But a low end 46 to early 50's
raid does not have the power to take Cazic Thule or Inny anymore. The levels
on them were raised awhile back, you need a majority of 55 plus players. For
raids on Velk the Sorceror u need 55 plus. To do ToV u need 55 plus,
Veeshans is 55 plus.

Getting the picture? People who say the fun of the game is level 1 to 40
dont know what they are talking about. Sure there is fun doing that. It can
also be very frustrating, some of the hardest level s are 40 to 51 because
of questing to obtain gear, difficulty of long quests, need for strong
guilds to obtain items etc. I once thought wow once I hit level 50 I can do
the things I want. Nope, in fact the game is designed for levels 58 to 60
this is when one can gain entrance to a truly Uber Guild and take down those
awesome mobs I dreamed about as a newbie. Im level 56 now, Ive done some of
those things such as Vox and Naggy raids (I'm too high now), I've fought in
Hate, Fear but never took down CT or Inny yet. There are many zones I havnt
been to, esp. in Velious. Goal now is to hit 60, find a stronger guild and
do the things I always wanted. Im ambitious and reaching the high end game
and fighting the uber mobs is what the game is designed for.
