Yep.   With the exception of Wakening Land, which was as (video) laggy as any
Kunark zone (it's actually smoothed out some since Luclin came out), the
velious zones learned the wavy tree lesson pretty well.  They tended to simple
ice covered surroundings, open for the most part, without a lot of landscape
that needs to be drawn in each zone.

Of course, you still do have to consider verant's oft repeated postion that
the video lag caused by the wavy trees was all in our heads, and didn't
actually exist.
