Actually, it doesn't even take combining special contributions.  Consider
two Warriors fighting as a pair, making sure to share damage (by each
tanking every other mob, or by taunting each mob off each other).  Twice the
damage output cuts the length of each fight in half, which means the mobs
total damage output is also cut in half.  Since that damage is shared, each
warrior takes 1/4 the damage he'd have taken soloing, so they have 1/4 the
downtime.  That should let them kill more than twice as many mobs per hour,
so even without a grouping bonus, they'd come out ahead.

Compare to two Wizards.  Again, the fights go twice as fast with two.  So,
each uses half the mana.  However, since the downtime for Wizards (other
than when something goes wrong) is entirely due to mana expenditure, rather
than to recover from anything the mob does over time, there is not that
extra factor of 1/2 that the two Warriors have, so in the case of two
Wizards, all they get is downtime being cut in 1/2.  So the best they get is
twice as many mobs per hour.  Without the grouping bonus, they might as well
just solo, unless they want to take mobs that are bigger than either can
solo.

One more case to consider now, with the new bonus system, is when you've got
a group of 5.  It would then be great to bring along one mule, if that mule
is high enough to get XP, because that XP will be free.
