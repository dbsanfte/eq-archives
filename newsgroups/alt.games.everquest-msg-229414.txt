Finally decided to claim my reward for buying the retail version of
LDoN, especially as the message to claim it wasn't showing up anymore.

After much wishy-washyness and some advice from a friend, I decided my
lower level cleric should have it (he's 14), but when I did the /claim
I was told that I had no pending rewards for the account.

First, the satchel had not been claimed.
Second, the message saying to /claim the satchel was missing since the
last patch.
Third, I do have a petition in about wanting to claim my satchel.

Kept that character on most of Sunday, but EQ was acting flaky, so GMs
must have been busy.

A formerly 14 cleric (Kurn's rules! Esp. with a really good group of
crazies<G>)
