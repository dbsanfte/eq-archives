Do not worry, someone that does not high-lvl friends and/or characters that
can give money, usually have the amount you describe. My lvl 27 shaman has
nothing special for her level, and has 180pp on the bank max, and i last
remembered she carried 30pp on her.

My other chars, a lvl 8 bard and a 14 wizard, also have amounts that are
quite normal for their level. My bard has 40pp because i could sell a HQ
Bear Skin in EC..... My wizard prolly has about the same.

The money will come.... and when you reach lvl 40 or so, you are rich enough
to twink a new character. And that is probably happened to the others of
your lvl, they got twinked by high lvl characters that can make money easy.
