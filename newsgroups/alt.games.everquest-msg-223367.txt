I hate the delay and also wish we could just request a certain type of
adventure and go do that.  It ends up that what you're offered is directly
proportional to the adventures you have or haven't done.

Has everyone in your group done a lot of slaughters?  Good luck getting one.
Done lots of collections, too?  Say hello to assassinations and rescues.
Either add some folks to your group who haven't done many of the kind you
want, or just do a few of your last choices to be offered your first choices
again.

I have no idea why they do that, except to make sure no one does their work
just on the "easier" ones like slaughter (which is still a strong challenge
due to the higher strenght/HP/AC of the mobs).
