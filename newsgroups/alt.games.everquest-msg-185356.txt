OK. I placed an order for this, went into EQ and it showed that ALL
expansions are enabled. Cool. Logged into server, was allowed to
create a Froglok. Nice. My first question is where do I find out how
to use the new features? Is there documentation somewhere that tells
me how to use the map, the tinting, etc.? And where are the new zones?
I started in Gukta and have gone to Innothule. Where is the
information on the new zones?

Also, is Innothule considered the Froglok newbie zone? I created a
Froglok Wizard (first attempt at a straight caster class) and it seems
I can't step too far away from the guards outside Gukta without
getting killed, repeatedly. I'm used to newbies zones like Greater
Faydark and Butcherblock; has Innothule been bumped up in difficulty?
