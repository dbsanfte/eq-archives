Um, I would of laughed at this person, you know you will be in HHK for a
while (seen people start here at 24 exactly and stay till 34ish).  If you
aint bound nearby it is your own fault. Yes the cleric should have some form
of mezz.

Why does a 30ish character need temp anyway, with that buff the cleric of a
similar level is almost redundant. Temp should be 34+ only IMO, maybe 40+
only.  It is too powerful for level 1+ (and I have used this on younger
characters myself, makes the game stupidly easy / boring).

By the way going through misty thicket / kithicor is a very quick way to
HHK, less than a 5 minute run.
