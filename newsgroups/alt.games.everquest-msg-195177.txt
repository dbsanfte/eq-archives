Correct, although weapon procs will hit him.  Have the clerics summon
hammers and tank!

Well, this is how we did it, pre-PoP.  Two groups of people hovering near
60.

Beastlord tanked Draz, with one cleric dedicated to healing the BST.
Casters were also casting on Draz, being sure not to over-aggro.

All the tanks focused on Draz's warder, which is a tough mob in its own
right.  The other cleric was dedicated towards healing the melees on the
warder.

After the warder went down, the melees used whatever proccing weapons they
had to fight Draz.  Both warder and Draz went down easily.

I'm not saying this is the best strategy; it's just the strategy we used.
Draz was never slowed, although I don't know if he's susceptible to PoP
slows or not.

If two groups of 60- people can take down Draz, one group of 65's with PoP
spells oughta be able to handle it easily.  Just make sure to have one tank
on the warder.

All in all, the BST epic is one of the easiest to get.  Almost as easy as
the cleric epic is now.  =)  Good luck in obtaining it!
