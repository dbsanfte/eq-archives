Get to the zone line of Paludal Caverns and the Nexus.  Loot rotting
corpses all the twinks leave laying around the bandit camps.  I still
do this with my 25 cleric.  Its amazing I can hit open corpses for
actual plat and gold.  You can also load up on the sullied weaps there
no one picks up.  Easy cash, just stay out of the way of the bandits.
Its seems these days not may people loot the low mobs at all.  I loot
everything!
