Sorry, just saw this: JekkeFILTER@from-nyc.co.uk  and since most email
addies containing .uk are from the UK, well anyway...  Now I know better.

I have no idea what you're talking about, but that is my own ignorance of
history apparently.

And, perhaps what I SHOULD have said to avoid any of this at all would have
been to say: "I was TOLD the Warrior Epic is broken.  Is this in fact true?"
Since I had no reason to doubt that the person who told me it was broken was
in error, I came here assuming that if it was broken, this would be the
place to find the answers.  This entire thread was a mistake on my part and
I'm very sorry I made the original post.

Thank you for all your assistance.
