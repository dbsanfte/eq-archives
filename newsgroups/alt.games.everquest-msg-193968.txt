Yeah, but the xp from duoing with a necro rocks.  Only real question is, 
why does a necro drag someone else along?  As for the buff thing, most of 
my buffs last long enough that it's not that much of an issue, and, most of 
the ones I use are group buffs, so I know when they run out, and don't 
often have to be reminded.
