because you can type a fair amount in each line...and I ask english 
speaking members of that language what is the best phrase to use for the 
language specific set of hotkeys.

and i dont use spaces on the NO MANA key, the others are a set of single 
language hot keys, as typically the problem is the puller, not the whole 
group. On SolRo there is a particular spanish speaking gnome SK that was 
heinously able to ignore me and keep pulling, even being spammed in 
spanish. after the 3d time grouped with him, I refuse to be in any group 
with him.

Now yesterday I grouped with a tank who didnt speak english for a hill 
of beans, but was very careful to check my mana and that of the other 
people in the group if there were more than 3 mobs that were next in the 
chute to be pulled. I will group with he and our wizzy again in a heartbeat.
