I tried a dish over at a friend's with EQ once via my laptop. Talk about
lag.

And of course the DSL service they don't provide any more was, well, DSL.

I'm in a similar boat, but in my state, ISDN is 'reasonable' ($43 a month
from the phone company, + ISP charges), and can be gotten anywahere the Baby
Bell has service.

So I've got 128k symmetric. My pings are actually lower than the average DSL
user (Sync instead of Async). But of course they are waay faster.
