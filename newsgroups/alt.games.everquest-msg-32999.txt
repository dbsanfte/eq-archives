Freeport is pretty much the city of choice for all
tradeskills, with the possible exception of halas for
pottery.

The one with the lowest trivial skill most likely.  if you
can forage, then start with making berry and fruit juices. 
Or auction to buy fruit and berry stacks.

I don't think there is a favorite.  Some people like
drinking some don't.  Most people in the game I know, don't
care.  As your alcohol tolerance goes up, some of the lower
end brews don't get you as drunk.  Ie with a high alcohol
tolerance it will take more bog juice to get a PC drunk,
than it will Ol' Tumjims.  Kinda like real life it takes
more beer than vodka to get someone drunk generally
speaking.

Not sure what you were looking for they didn't provide. 
They offer the trivial levels of each item, etc. 
Personally, I think they offer about the best site on
brewing I have found.
