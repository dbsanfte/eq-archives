How about a new type of spell, Moaning Ghost? You are struck dead, but instead
of going to your bind point, you end up in some nasty place naked and with no
gear. The bottom of Befallen would be good enough for that. (Oh, all you level

do that. And melees... how is your hand to hand? Feel up to getting the keys?)
