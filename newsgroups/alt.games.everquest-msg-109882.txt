Faster is better when I am the MA I use a lammy and a Blood Point when I am
just doing damage I use a Wurmy and a Blood Fire. When useing the fast
weapons and taunting it is very difficult to steal aggro and when useine the
higher damage stuff I rarely ever get hit. I have tested the damage output
with EQphaser and I do slightly more damage per sec with the slower higher
damage weapons.
