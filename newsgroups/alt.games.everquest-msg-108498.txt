Highkeep was one of my favorite hunting zones, but yeah, when it gets full,
it starts to suck.

Would've heavily recommended Cazic-Thule a few months ago, but now.... no.
(well, maybe a group outside now)

Might be able to get a group at HGs in Rathe Mtns, also inside Splitpaw or
Crystal Caverns on Velious, very unlikely, but possible that you could get a
group in Lguk.  Could also probably get a group in Iceclad hunting cougars.

Other than that, Welcome to Kunark.
