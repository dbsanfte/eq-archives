Well for that matter Harmony, although it is a spell, is unresistable - 
that's the whole point of it. The only way I could see it not working is if 
you can't actually get within spellcasting range to cast it in the first 
place without aggroing something. Sounds more likely that some friend of a 
friend said it didn't work because they are no bloody good at using harmony 
(there are a lot a bad druids out there unfortunately). Unless the mobs are 
actually giving some message that they're immune to it or somesuch.

What next? I'm waiting to hear something ridiculous like:

- Tashes reported not to work in the new CT
- Damageshields reported not to work in the new CT
- Corpse dragging reported not to work in the new CT, as in Kael etc

And I'm deliberately leaving those suggestions on their own seperate lines 
so some idiot can quote me out of context, oversnip, and start a panic :)
