Maximum exp for minimum downtime, use animals to your advantage. Snare, 
fear, and whack away. Fighting animals also ensures a getaway scheme- fear 
it and run like mad to the zone. ALWAYS zone after doing this, as many mobs 
consolidate hate lists and you can become Animal Enemy #1 reeeeal quick. 
Maybe not a big deal with bears, but trust me when I say this will SUCK 
when it comes to lions and other SoW-outrunnin' beasties.

At 14 you get Befriend Animal, Stinging Swarm, and SoW. These spells are 
essential to this method, and rake in the exp with minimal downtime 
(actually, the same downtime, but you get more kills in the process).

find a low blue or green mob that hits hard (around 17 griffawns are great 
for this!). Charm it. Send it after a red animal mob. Snare the mob, DoT 
it, and fear it while your pet tanks. Target your pet and sit down to 
meditate.

Your pet will chase the mob, hacking away on it. he will kill it or break 
charm. If it breaks charm, run like hell until you are out of range to cast 
charm, then start trying to cast it over and over. The mob will run into 
range and you can squeeze a charm off before he gets to you.

Always let the mob smack your pet until it is at 1/3 life or so. Then, when 
he breaks charm and you are starting to run low (1/2 or a little less) on 
mana, you can root the pet, nuke it, and get exp for it.

I can tell you that a blue or green con griffawn will eat three red con 
scythe beetles with no worries.
