> >>> what's so wrong with corpse runs??

Nothing.  They provide a tangible penalty for dying and that's important for
the game.  If this were a videogame and when you died you'd just have to
continue from where you left off (albeit with less experience) it would make
the death experience less of a hassle, and frankly, dying should be a
bothersome, unpleasant experience.

Why, I remember the time my necro innocently (as it were) took the boat to
FV for the first time.  There he was peering at the dock while still on the
boat when suddenly a guard jumped onto the boat and killed him.  That's
going to be a tricky extracation, I thought.  Actually, it was worse than I
expected because the corpse was no where to be found upon my return about 90
minutes later.  30 minutes of searching and it was finally recovered by a GM
who found it at the bottom of the sea at the zone edge (where the boat had
finally dropped it).  It was an unexpected 2.5 hours added to my evening's
adventuring because of an unexpected event (I didn't know I'd be KOS on a
new continent), and it was a hell of a lot of fun.  The adreniline, the
pounding heart, the rapid, furtile movements and frequent glances in all
directions.  This kind of surprise and suspense is why I enjoy the game.
Besides, occaisionally losing everything and starting over is also good for
the soul.

I know that it's an inconvenience to the players who want to race to the
highest level, or buy their uber loot, but for me corpse runs add a lot to
the game.  If you don't like corpseruns, go play some arcade game.
