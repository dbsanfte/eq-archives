If you have supposedly cancelled my postings here please explain why they are
all still showing up. Once again you mouth has overloaded you ass and you have
been busted. You have cancelled only the messages YOU posted yourself and now
can't lie your way out of it. It's pitiful that you post stuff on here about
your own kids (if you even have a daughter) in order to get sympathy, I don't
see how you can live with yourself after doing that.

Nope, although I am sure that's what you wish...  :^)

I have cancelled everyone of Goondi/MD's messages..  To do that, it
necessitates me changing my posting info..   I simply forgot to change
it back...  :^)

But, by all means, believe what you want..  You have never let
anything like facts get in your way of your spewage, so why start
now??  :^)
