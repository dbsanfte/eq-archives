Lmao thankgod I'm not the only one who does this, playing a dark elf cleric
as my main for a year then deciding on a whim to make a druid for when I
needed a break. At one point in time guildmate bellowed they needed coffins
(yes plural lol) and off I ran to neriak, didn't clue in till I heard blood
curdling screams from the guards and watched my hp bar begin to plummet and
finnally lay me to rest right at the zone line to neriak. Lovely people
sitting at the zone sent me numerous tells inquiring as to my mental state
which kept me laughing for hours.
