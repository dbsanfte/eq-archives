ahahahaahah, but this would be unfair to those who've already been through
the hell levels.
Would smoothing out this bug actually mean an instant boost in exp? Would my
lvl 32 ding 33 instantly (provided the exp shift pushed him along that
far)?Why would anyone mind getting free exp (sort off). I mean we've earned
it.

If smoothing over the hell levels means that everyone that's been through
them gains a level or part of a level, I don't see the problem. Everyone pre
51 will just gain a level, no problem there I venture. Everyone above will
still gain a level or aa point. The level 60's out there that can't gain a
level will just gain AA points. I still see no problem.
The only problem could occur when a lvl 60 get's all his aa points and
spends them all and can no longer advance in anyway shape or form. Indeed
those people will stand to loose out on the bargain. Then again, what do
they have to complain about really, they're there, they've arived, gave
over.

I might be missing the point though.
