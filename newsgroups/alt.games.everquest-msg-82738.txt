> - can you mule in Everquest ?

Sorry. Don't know what that is :)

> - how many accounts can you have ?

As much as you want to pay for. With one account you can make many
characters though, you can just play only one at a time.

> - is pvp possible ?

Yes, there are special PvP servers. You can also select to be a Player
Killer on other servers, but that is not going to be easy as you can't group
with non-Player Killers. PvP is best played on the three (or two can't
remember) PvP servers.

> - is it full of dupes and hacks already ?

No. Everquest is not yet hacked. Bugs are a different story, but Verant
patches almost weekly these days.

> - is it possible to solo ?

Yes. Depends a bit on which class you select, but you can solo a great deal
in Everquest if you prefer. Some classes you will need to group anyways
after a while to get the best experience without being smashed to pieces.

> - are there persons in the game who can kick/ban you / censor what you say
etc.?

Yes, called GMs. They can also help you with things if you do a /petition.
In general, being offensive (in language or in behaviour) can cost you your
account. If you are that type of person, perhaps EQ is not the best choice
for you. Verant is very aware that young teenagers play the game, and keep
an eye on things. Also, other players can use /petition to report a user
that is abusive or offensive.

> - do you have a stash /how big is the inv (compared to diablo 2 exp) ?

Depends on the Strenght a character has. Certain races and/or classes have
more strenght then others and therefore can carry more. Then there is also
the bank which hold just about everything you want. The bank has 8 slots,
but can hold 10-slot backpacks which therefore allows you to store 80 items
in the bank. Banks can be accesses in any city.


Hope this helps

Maarten
