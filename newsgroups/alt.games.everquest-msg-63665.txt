}In other words, I *was* just commenting on the analogy. Silly character
}names annoy you. Poor analogies annoy me :)

I find it debatable.  If a player gains absolutely no advantage by naming 
their character something obnoxious like Tigole Bitties, -why- do they 
insist on doing it, and why do they whine incessantly when called on it?  
If it gives them no advantage, it surely costs nothing for them to lose 
it.  there may not be as immediate an advantage that we can see, but they 
must see some advantage to it, or they'd go 'oh, this is agaist the rules. 
It may cause me grief later.  I better not do it.'  Well, unless they have 
the wisdom of fenceposts, which is always a realistic possibility.

But I do think the NFL socks analogy was far superior. :)
