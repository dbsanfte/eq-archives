Me too... but a bad one since it wasn't cash oriented, and thats the 
principle sort of cheating they seemed to be talking about.

OR maybe I was just misled by the thread title, and they were addressing 
a whole raft of sorts of cheating all at once.  For example, they seem 
to have stealth nerfed the whole "repeat part of the quest to build 
faction" approach to the shaman epic, although some time ago, perhaps 
they've done a bunch more of that sort of thing as well.

Splendid
