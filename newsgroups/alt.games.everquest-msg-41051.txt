All I have is a printed color copy, I don't think that it would survive the
transition back to digital form, being as all I have is a digital camera to
do that with.  Just did a quick search, didn't find that one, but the one at
eqatlas seems to be pretty good.  Searched some more, the one I use I got at
Eqmaps, but upon examination, the one at eqatlas looks better.   BTW, did
you want those steel toed boots back?
