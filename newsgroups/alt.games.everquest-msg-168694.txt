Since everyone else is too busy whapping over your HTML use I will try to
attempt the actual question.

Couple of things you migth want to check:

- You did not turn on some of the new models for Luclin in the Options

- You have been turned into a wolf by a druid (or any other form that is not
your character for that matter)
