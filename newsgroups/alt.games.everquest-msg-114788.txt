A friend of mine posted the following on our guild board:

Durgroz (the turn-in mob for the HS key) has been moved. He is now in the
center of the Swamp zone in a froglok village.

There are now 4 lvl 55 mobs where the low level mobs in the TT/Swamp river
tunnel used to be. They will aggro you and they will kill you horribly.

The do NOT see invis, so please spread the word quickly that if anyone is
going to run from Swamp to TT or vise versa, make sure you are Invis.
