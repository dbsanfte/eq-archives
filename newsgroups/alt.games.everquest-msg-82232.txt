Unless what people have said recently is true, and the naming policies have 
slackened to where you don't have to fake a "wedding" and "divorce" to get 
a new surname.  Seems like I've even read that in a patch message or 
something.

Apparently, it's pretty easy now to get your Surname changed.

I wouldn't pick a surname when you hit level 20.  Let one come to you, one 
that you -know- is it.
