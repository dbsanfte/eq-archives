    Used to be all of PoV was awesome, before the hordes came.

    Places I love going for XP:

-Carprin room in CoD. Lots of easy, high XP mobs, no traps or oddness like
in the Bubonian area, and the odd 20 K item drop. A 65 necromancer with the
65 charm spell can take one of these mobs to zone-in and get an AA every
*12* minutes.
-pit in Plane of Tactics. Great XP, and the drops are nice (ornate armour
molds, spectral parchments).

    I avoid HoH because it has the feel of a nerfed zone, and the kiters are
still a major hassle there. BoT is the personal playground of another guild,
so I don't go there either. Torment is a hole.

    James
