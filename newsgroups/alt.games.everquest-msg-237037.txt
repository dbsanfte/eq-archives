I love this quest. About once a month I take any lvl 1-9 (5-9 after i help
them get some XP so they don't die from the fall) that want to go on this
quest.  I think the first time I was running this quest I had about 35
players with me.  I always have them bind at the FM/OT zone, just in case we
loose someone on the way.  If i have players that are over lvl 10 that want
to do this quest I take my cleric with me and Rez them at the target mob,
should the invis wear off at the wrong time.

Other easy quests from PoK Are:
Fine Antique Ring which has Mana Preservation II on it.

And Fine Antique Corset Which also has Spell haste for those that don't want
to give up there Face slots.
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2198
Averything in these 2 can be bought in the bazaar/colected by a lvl 30+ in
under an hour.
