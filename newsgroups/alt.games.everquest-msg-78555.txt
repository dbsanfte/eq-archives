Here is what I have experienced. (please excuse the top/middle posting)

There is a very small chance of having sneak/hide (S/H) drop.  I can
remember it happening to me only one time without a Mob near.


>What happen if I take falling damage, does it go away?


Nope, taking falling damage still leaves you S/H. (unless you take 10,000,
then you will appear at the bind point total visible. ;-P

>What if I am Lev'd and it drops, and I accelerate rapidly to the ground?
>Does it drop then?


Not that I have seen.

>Do I ever get to go faster when I Hide / Sneak?


Try and be Sow'd when you have to S/H for any great distance.  At high
levels your sneak/hide speed increases up to where you will be running just
as fast S/H as visable.  Not sure on the exact levels though.


>So much to learn...>The Safehouse won't display properly on any of the

Personally, I skip the Safehouse menus and head straight for the Safehouse
message boards.  That is where all the information and good advice it.


Some other S/H info.

It used to be that when someone cast a spell on you, you would be visible.
They have fixed that now so that buffage/healing doesn't affect your
visibility.

Some mobs see through S/H.  Bats in Sol B,  Assassin in LGUK, Dragons  can
all see through S/H... HOWEVER, if you remain BEHIND the line of sight of
these mobs, you can stay alive.  I love to see screenshots of brave rogues
standing behind dragons and other Boss mobs with only sneak on.

Sneak / Hide isn't as reliable against mobs many levels higher than you.  If
your level 20 and the mob is level 40, there is a greater chance of you
becoming lunch.

Learn to con mobs with the "c" key rather than "right-click", if you
accidentally loot something, you will unhide and you will get creamed.

You can start sneak/hide while swimming... but!... you can start on land and
then go into the water S/H, you WILL swim SAH (Slow as Hell) though.

It is hard to be running, stop quickly and click Sneak/Hide.  The lag makes
the system think your still moving and you will get a failure. (similar to
casting while moving)   What I do is stop running, then tap a turn arrow
key.  This forces the system to accept a stop and turn before you send it
the sneak/hide. (again, casters use this method to insure their spells go
off.)

Hope these tips help.  If I am incorrect in my theories listed above...don't
worry.  People posting here LOVE to correct me. :-)
