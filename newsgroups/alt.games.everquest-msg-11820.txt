Level 30 gobs in ButcherBlock!? The previous gobs were levels 1-8 I would
guess. In fact the toughest MOB in BB is Peg Leg or the Undead King. IIRC
they are level 14 or lower.

Where are these gobs? Used to be a camp of goblin warriors near Peg Leg, a
camp of various gobs near the cross roads, and a camp of various gobs near
the chestboard plus a bunch of roamers. An some roaming aqua gobs by the
docks.
