Nope but GM's often interpret the rules differently to their colleagues.
Reading the naming policy I don't see how your name violates it.
Even the above mentioned use of d' does not fall into it as most people
reading would not see d'aigle as a title and the fact that it reads
coeurd'aigle looks fine to me (of course the name Plum Sucker would be
considered a suitable name by some people in this NG so my opinion is of
little consequence)
The problem you have now is that your name is likely marked and as such
you'll not be able to get it changed to Coeurd'aigle by any GM/Guide, worse
they may now see your other characters having that surname as a violation.
A bit stupid that someone trying to be inventive is penalised for a rule to
try a stop names like Ima Gudtank.
