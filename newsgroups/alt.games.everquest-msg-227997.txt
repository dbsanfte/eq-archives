I pointed out that his "savior" who had all sorts of great ideas was nothing
more than a babbling fool who didn't listen to his own developers and
apparently was only good at spending money without ever showing any progress
and making promises that his crew could never back up.  I never was
contending that Horizons became a good game or a revolutionary one as the
result of David Allen leaving and those horrible soulless corporate stooges
coming in, but I will note that they actually *have* put a game out, one
which may or may not be successful someday, but I don't particularly give a
shit.

David Allen's project ran out of money *three fucking years* before they had
*anything* that could be released beyond gussied up screenshots and wild,
unfeasible promises.

As for him supporting his particular contention, I'm sorry, but I'm not
seeing it.  I just see a guy who lapped up all of David Allen's bullshit and
is upset with the people who came in to clean it up.  He doesn't seem to
realize that there wouldn't be a Horizons at all if it had been left to
Allen.

I think there's a real issue to be made here about MMORPGs, but this guy's
not making it.

But since you read the whole article, show me the numbers the guy relies on
to make whatever point he's trying to make.  I was under the impression that
if this was some sort of numbers argument, the guy would get trounced.  You
can argue plenty of things against EQ, but numbers isn't one of them.
