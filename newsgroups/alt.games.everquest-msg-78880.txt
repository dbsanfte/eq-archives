What browsers do you have?  On my RedHat 7.2 system, it's fine in
Konqueror, Mozilla, links, and lynx.  Broken in Netscape (hangs at 8%
of every page, but is mostly OK if you click "stop").

There are some things that look broken, but that are actually ezboard
screwing up, such as threads that say they have several replies, but
show up with no replies when you enter the thread.
