No. it's pretty hard to get any plate for a *druid*: Getting plate for
a ranger is no more difficult than getting chain for a druid.

Ever seen a female iksar in SS warrior armor? For that matter, have
you ever looked at it with velious graphics on and luclin graphics
off? If it resembles a dusty, velious graphics will amend that.

SS druid armor used to be brown too (not leather brown like thurg
druid armor, but tinted brown). Woven grass? More like withered grass.
