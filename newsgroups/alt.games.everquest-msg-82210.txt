Oh, and for all of you folk who think this is an empty
thought experiment, I refer you to:

Spencer, R. "Parasitic Conjoined Twins: External, Internal
(Fetuses In Fetu and Teratomas), and Detached (Acardiacs).
Clinical Anatomy 14:428-444, 2001.


The "they are all completely human" crowd has a lot of 
explaining to do.

To quote from the article:

Parasitic twins are joined to an otherwise relatively
normal fetus (the autosite) in one of the same sites
of union as intact conjoined twins.  They usually consist
of externally attached supernumerary limbs, not infrequently
with some viscera, but very rarely with a functional heart
or brain... [Fetuses in fetu are partially involuted twins 
which exist as encapsulated masses inside the autosite]...  

... Acardiacs are attached to the autosite only by the
umbilical vessels on the placenta but without a direct
vascular connection to the placental circulation; therefore
they are prefused with "used blood".

end quote

So, all you "they are all completely human" folk.  Is that
third foot "less than human?"  Oops!  Can't say that or you're
a Nazi! Or does that foot deserve all the rights and privileges 
of a citizen? Oops!  Can't say that or you're and idiot.  Or
a fundamentalist.
