 Troll clans have long fought amongst themselves for the right to rule
their race. With the creation of the Night Keep, the Grobb clan firmly
established its dominance over the trolls. The Broken Skull clan was
driven from the city and built a stronghold of its own. Years later,
in a flood of brutish strength and cunning the trolls of the Broken
Skull clan returned, and by their actions forever changed Norrath.
