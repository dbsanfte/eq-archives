Correct.  They saw at eqtraders that they get more than a million hits
a month.  Looking at *just* the HTML for the front page, I see about
32k of text.  That's 32 gigabytes a month of bandwidth right there.

32 gigabytes a month is enough to get noticed by a hosting company.
For comparison, a dedicated T1 going flat out for a month can transfer
about 450 gigabytes.  That means just the front page text of eqtraders
consumes about 7% of a T1.  Not counting the 9/11 graphic on the page,
the logos and menus and stuff add another 12k or so.  I wonder how
many pages an average visitor visits?
