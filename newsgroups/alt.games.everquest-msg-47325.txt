Yeah, but it so "little" better that for the first time in a year and
a half I've played a character without infra (a barb shaman) on the FV
server and I feel blind as hell at night. I did not notice the
difference at all. I guess if you were playing right when they
switched it you might but otherwise non infra/ultra night vision is
still quite horrible. In a non lit tunnel like zoning out of halas at
night its totally pitch black and you could not see without a light
source. Meanwhile both my wood elf and dark elf hardly even notice
when its night (I have to often look at /time to tell)

So that guy playing the iksar still has a LARGE advantage.
