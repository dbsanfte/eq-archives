Well, I call all melee types "tanks", so more precise would be
"secondary melee" where it is assumed the MT is keeping aggro.

However, my Bard tanks quite well when teamed with a Shaman.  The
combination of Shaman slow + Selos Chain is huge.  I tanked for a
couple hours with a Shaman in DSP.  Non stop pulling of Zelniaks,
shrooms, and crawlers.  He would have to Greater heal me every 4 mobs
or so.
