   What is done is done.  We're glad you're with us now.

   I would guess more than 20%, certainly.  At 50%, I would hope that they
would start collapsing servers rather than just start pulling all the
plugs.  But of course, I don't know what SOE will really do.  I do think
that this shakedown is just a precursor, though.  When WoW/EQII comes out,
we might really find out what happens when these numbers become real.  Or
not... But one thing that seems certain to me is that enough people have
canceled that SOE got a loud wake up call, as evidenced by the push back
date of OoW and the recent summit.

   I can barely keep my chat straight playing a cleric, no way I would be
able to do it with a bard, this I know.  And while the idea of bard has
always been interesting to me, I simply don't really want to play that
"busy" of a character.

   Ya, that is what I was thinking.  This character, in all probability,
would just be an extended break from my cleric on FV.  I certainly can't
see getting her much higher than the fifties.  And if I ever did miss being
in high group demand, I could just always roll up a newbie cleric, I
suppose.  Though really, I don't want to have to deal with the cost of
DoTs.

   Morell Thule sounds as good a place as any to me.  The only problem is
that any character I start up will lag far behind any one you do.  I simply
don't level that fast, and it will be even slower now that I'm basically
off line Monday-Thursday do to this new job I have, plus playing CoH alot
also.  Plus, I don't want to seem like I'm looking for a start up hand out
from you (or any other agers).  So if I do come to MT, no putting 30K in a
trade window or anything!  (25k... maybe.  /giggle).

   Just tell you wife that you read that playing EQ with your kids is an
excellent way to keep them out of prison.  And for the other objection..
well... just give into the inevitable.  Your grandkids are going to be
brains floating in jars with electrodes attached to CPU's.  Accept it now,
and it will be much easier on you.
