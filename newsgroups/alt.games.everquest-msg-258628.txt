   Yep.  Like you Lance, I've only rarely disbanded Pain In the Neck
members.  But on the time or two that I did, there was much rejoicing in
group chat.  Seems that no bad how things get, the mentality is that "Well,
if this is too bad, then the leader will boot them".  Come to think of it,
I can't remember a time when I was a non-leader and suggested that someone
be booted.
