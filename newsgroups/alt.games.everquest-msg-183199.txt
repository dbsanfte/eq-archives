Well I made one just for kicks.  I won't play it for a few days just to let
the general "newness" die down.  Just logged in for a couple minutes to see
the mayhem.  Yes, it seems there were over 170 new froggies, all level 1 it
seemed....
The strange thing is, after scrolling through alllllllll the names after
doing /who, there was only *ONE* version of "Kermit".  I was very, very
surprised.

I did, however, spy a nice young lady frog with the name "Amphibia".  That
was at least a little creative.
