April 29th 2003

On Thursday I am buying a new Video card.
I called around to the local computer shop's to check
prices. I found a Geforce 4 Mx 4400 128mb card within my
price range. Now I am looking to buy a 128mb card the only thing
that got me thinking was aren't the Geforce 4 mx series. Just rebuilt
Geforce 2 card's with more memory. ok I may be wrong but I am not
really sure will I get good Graphic's performance from the MX 4400 I
do alot of highend gaming any help would be appreciated if anybody has
any information about this card.

Thanks in Advance
