Planar maps they don't have, and Muse explains why on the page.  As to
maps missing in Kunark there is VP, HS, and Chardok.  VP is pretty
obvious, HS was traditionally the most under-utilized high end
dungeon, and until the recent changes, Chardok was also very, very
empty.  Of course he is currently working on maps of VP and Chardok.  
Here are the Velious maps that are missing from EQMaps:  Skyshrine,
Dragon Necropolis, Siren's Grotto, Sleeper's Tomb, Temple of Veeshan,
and Velketor's Lab.  The only one of those zones that ANYONE below
level 50 would ever have a reason to explore is Skyshire.
There are still several maps in Luclin that are useful and not there
yet, especially Fungus Grove, since that is a travel zone.  However,
if eqatlas has a map of a given zone, chances are that it is the best
available map for tha zone.  (OK, there was a japanese site that had
really nice Kunark maps, but I can't find it.)
For someone fairly new to Everquest, looking to travel just about
anywhere, and interested in the location of vendors, landmarks, and
most camps, EQAtlas is the first, best choice.  For certain post-50
dungeons, or a second opinion, I check EQMaps, though I don't put a
lot of faith in many of their maps.
