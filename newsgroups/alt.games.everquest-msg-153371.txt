    When there's enough people there (and there sure is these days), there
aren't enough mobs up to cause the famous adds that you likely remember. I
can run from ME zone to Vex Thal without seeing anything up except for the
Massive Stone Guardians at VT. The random armour drops are a huge plus to
keep people there, too - a lot of it would be very nice for the Velk's
crowd.

    And this being an outdoor zone, nothing stops them from training the
zone, then coming back to do it again. With the new ability to see what
percent of a total bar of XP you just got per kill, a lot of folks have
stopped looking at overall XP/hour and focus on XP/kill. So they don't
notice that their XP is going slowly from training out, they just think it's
the best XP ever.
