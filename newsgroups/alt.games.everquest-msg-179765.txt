[1] Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good for a =
man not to touch a woman.

[2] Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, =
and let every woman have her own husband.

[3] Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise =
also the wife unto the husband.

There is something really soothing about this verse.


[4] The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and =
likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife.

[5] Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, =
that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together =
again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.

That sounds kind of fun actually.


[6] But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.

[7] For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath =
his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.

[8] I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if =
they abide even as I.

[9] But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to =
marry than to burn.

Basically says that if your body tells you that you want to have sex, =
then you should marry. Very important verse in my opinion, my entire =
generation rejected this concept (including me and I have paid a =
horrendous price as a result, essentially what amounts to 7 years of =
solitary confinement with only Satan himself to talk to, he's really =
entertaining actually, good at video games too).

Basically, if you are a Christian then God will send the perfect person =
for you at some time early in your life, I think most people probably =
reject them as they would reject paradise if it was presented to them. =
In my case there were some weird circumstances, but in my heart I had =
already rejected God, I suppose that maybe he wanted me to be the way I =
am now so I could do this, but he seems to be telling me that I was =
supposed to do this all along and if I had chosen differently, then I =
would have been significantly better although he says that I am doing =
quite well anyway. I guess what I'm saying is that I was given the word =
of God on a silver platter (although I was not raised in a Christian =
home), and I rejected most of it and completely exorcised God out of my =
life, but followed some of the ideas like remaining celibate until =
marriage and apparently am back in God's graces again doing what I was =
meant to do at this time.

Another important point is that if you are a Christian, then you must =
marry another Christian. If you do not then you will SUFFER THE FULL =
WRATH OF GOD NEARLY EVERY DAY OF YOUR LIFE WHILE YOU ARE MARRIED.

THE MOST WONDERFUL THING THAT CAN HAPPEN IN THE WORLD IS WHEN TWO =
CHRISTIANS MARRY, THERE IS PROBABLY CURSING AND GNASHING OF TEETH IN =
HELL WHENEVER THIS OCCURS.

How do I know this? Because neither of my parents were Christians the =
entire time I was raised and it took 10 years to have me, I was very =
sickly when I was born for years, and my entire life so far has been =
generally one long cursed existance starting the day I began puberty. I =
think my father is starting to be saved, but my mother will never be =
saved.  =20


[10] And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not =
the wife depart from her husband:

[11] But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled =
to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.

[12] But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife =
that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not =
put her away.

[13] And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he =
be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.

[14] For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the =
unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children =
unclean; but now are they holy.

This is true, but God will really bless two Christians when they marry, =
to the point they won't even have to try anymore, everything will just =
open before them assuming that is what God wants them to do.


[15] But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a =
sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to =
peace.

[16] For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? =
or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?

[17] But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called =
every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.

[18] Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become =
uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be =
circumcised.

[19] Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the =
keeping of the commandments of God.

[20] Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.

[21] Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou =
mayest be made=20
free, use it rather.

It would appear that God called me into service starting the first day =
of this year, almost as though I was looking through another set of =
eyes. I guess I was free to do whatever I wanted the rest of my life, I =
basically just spent my life learning about various things and trying to =
have a good generally clean time, although I have been known to =
occasionally perform feats of drinking immense quantities of alcohol, =
but not much anymore.


[22] For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's =
freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ's =
servant.

[23] Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.

[24] Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with =
God.

My experience with this has been accurate, if God is using you for some =
purpose, then you are generally free of most everything related to the =
world assuming that is what God wants for your life and he will give you =
what you want as long as that is what he wants as well which is always =
what is best for you and always what you really want. You also have to =
do everything he tells you to do, or at least make regular progress or =
he may find someone else. Apparently he says that he will want to use me =
for approximately 37 years, 3.5 years now as a prophet, seems to hint =
that I should be studying social sciences and military strategy, =
strategy in general, seems to suggest that if I applied at Stanford =
University and said who I was "End Times Prophet - A" and explained what =
I was doing briefly, I would get a full scholarship there to study =
social sciences, seemed to suggest that I should try to finish by Fall =
2005, teach one year of Jr.High so my old teacher can retire with =
dignity instead of teaching until he drops and then I suppose the =
rapture will occur in 2006 sometime and I'm not even really going to =
worry about that.=20

He also says that when you measure people in talents like in the verse, =
there are 1 talent people, 2 talent people, 5 talent people, etc. =
Apparently I was a 1 talent person who made 10. I was really motivated =
though.=20


[25] Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I =
give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be =
faithful.

[26] I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I =
say, that it is good for a man so to be.

[27] Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed =
from a wife? seek not a wife.

[28] But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, =
she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: =
but I spare you.

[29] But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that =
both they that have wives be as though they had none;

[30] And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, =
as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed =
not;

[31] And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of =
this world passeth away.

[32] But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried =
careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the =
Lord:

[33] But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, =
how he may please his wife.

[34] There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried =
woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in =
body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the =
world, how she may please her husband.

[35] And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare =
upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the =
Lord without distraction.

[36] But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his =
virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him =
do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry.

[37] Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no =
necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his =
heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.

[38] So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that =
giveth her not in marriage doeth better.

[39] The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if =
her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; =
only in the Lord.

[40] But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think =
also that I have the Spirit of God.


I am a Roman Catholic monastic nun. I know a lot of Protestants believe =
that Catholics are not Christian, but they are. I hope I have not =
scandalized too many people with my writings to Louis, but a nun is =
fully human who has made certain choices in order to serve the Kingdom =
of God. I am celibate and always will be, but I have the full range of =
human desires and longings too, I just choose not to act on some of =
them.
