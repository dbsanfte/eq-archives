You must've never tested DAoC, cause yeah it can be boring but they are
working on all that.  As for FORCED PVP, no they are not doing that.  I've
talked to programs before and was told that if one didn't want to PVP they
didn't have to, that they'd have dungeons in there for the higher lvls to
hunt in instead of PVP.  The game is really shaping up and I think I'd play
DAoC over AO any day.  AO from what I've test is good but nothing that I'm
gonna buy, at least not right away.
