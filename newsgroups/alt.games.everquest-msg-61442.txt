Doesn't sound like you've got the Velious GUI enhancements installed. 
Perhaps you installed from the CD, went through the patch but haven't 
actually activated the expansion - there is some screen somewhere (maybe in 
account or options or something, I can't remember), where you type in your 
CD-key for the Velious expansion to activate it and permanently register it 
to that particular account. You have done that bit, right?

Failing that, you have run the Velious patch program, not just the standard 
and Kunark ones?
