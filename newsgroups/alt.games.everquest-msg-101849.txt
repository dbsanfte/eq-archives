I precede the internet too, that's not the point.  In EQ, there are two
things: video slowdown (stutter, low FPS) and lag (missing packets,
latency).  People confuse the two quite often, that's my point :)  If you
turn all new models on and put clip plane at max and it looks like a
slideshow when you turn, that's video slowdown.   If you're meleeing a
running mob and he disappears for a second and jumps forward five feet,
that's lag, as the term is used in EQ.
