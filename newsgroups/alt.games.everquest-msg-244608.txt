Well, I wouldn't go straight for the 'if you're anon, you're acting
in a way you don't want other people to see' reason. In our guild,
we have a lot of clerics who go anon a lot of the time to keep from
getting constant (or near constant) tells asking for rezzes and heals.
I think there are other possible and non-criminal reasons for wanting
to go anon other than 'I wanna hide what I'm doing'.

Having said that, sounds like a silly reason to deguild. But, then
again, I've seen quite a few silly reasons (IMO) for deguilding in
the months I've been in a guild. 'I don't want to go to the website
so I'll just bug the heck out of everyone else asking them what's
going on and where to be and what to do. I don't want to have to
join *two* chat channels and you can't make me. The officers are
always telling us what to do or what not to do.' <grin>
