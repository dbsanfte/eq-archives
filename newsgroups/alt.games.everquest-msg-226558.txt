I totally agree.  My biggest problem?  My warrior doesn't *want* to have to
learn a bunch of new skills in order to be a warrior.  That's not what he
signed up for.  The way I see it, it just means a warrior is going to have to
work even HARDER.
I'm not asking that they nerf paladins, I'm just asking they don't make
warriors harder to play.  Honestly, if they add in a bunch of things I'm going
to have to work at, I'll start a paladin myself.  If I'm going to *work* at
being a fighter I want to heal, pacify and rez too.
My warrior has never had a problem getting a group, (I'm sure because of level
and twinkage), so the *problem* that they are trying to *fix* hasn't really hit
me yet.
