There was no encouragement to try to participate in the events. Otherwise he
would have said it. And when he says "these events are a little different
than gm events", why would he generalize it to that? Other than he assumes I
mean that I am only talking about GM events. Even on holiday events and such
where there is an invasion, by the time I even get there, some other people
come in and have already killed everything. I was reading on my guild
message board that there were werewolf spawns in WC that were dropping some
good midlvl stuff but in less than 10 minutes everything was dead. I don't
spend time in or near WC so it would take longer than 10 minutes for me to
get there ) even if I could get on.
