First, leave your current guild, preferably as smoothly and nicely as
possible, stay on good terms with the people you liked in it.

Second, stay unguilded for a while.  Its not really that bad being
unguilded, there's no need to jump at your first suitor like you
are in fear of becoming an old maid.  Particularly with the new
chat channels, you can really get most of the benefits of being
in a guild on raids and so forth anyway.

Third, start paying attention to people's guild tags as you group with
them, and go out of your way to group with a wide assortment
of people.  When you find some people you like that all seem
to have the same guild tag, see if you can arrange to go on some raids
with them and also make a point of seeking out other people from
the same guild and grouping with them where possible.  See if you
can find their web site, and go surf their board.  Try them out for
a while, while keeping your eyes open for other possibilities.

Fourth, check out /who all "guild name" and look at their participation
during the hours you play, and their level range.  Consider your
own leveling habits.  If you level slowly, a guild with a lot of people
your level and under will be one that you can stay with for quite a
while, before everyone has leveled up so far past you that you can't
keep up anymore.  If you level rapidly, one that has mostly people
higher level than you will last you longer, as you go from being low
man on the totem pole to one of the highest level guys there.

Fifth, don't take your guild too seriously at your level.  Very likely
you will leave it for another in your 50s, and probably again eventually
when you are 60.  Its just a sad fact of EQ dynamics that causes people
to move on to guilds that can do the higher level things, and even if you
don't feel that drive personally, eventually so many of your friends will
be in that higher level guild, and you'll be so awash in low levels you
don't know, that you'll feel its natural to move on anyway.  Even if
you don't change, guilds do, as you are noting now.
