Well, at least when you get to 57, the coffin is less expensive, and better
yet, stackable.  I've done the same thing when I had an extra coffin on me
in case of a death (it was at level 44 or 45, though).  Loot dropped into
it, and, when I did need to ude the coffin, I lost the 2 things in the
coffin.  For me, it was a realtively (20pp or so worth of drops) cheap
lesson.

And yes, the Coldain are rather easy to impress.
