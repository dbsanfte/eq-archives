I had practically the same problems when running AOL 7.0. I experienced about 5
times as much lag with 7.0. My hunch is that it has something to do with 7.0
requiring so much more system resources to run. It seems that each subsequent
version of AOL is a much bigger resource hog than the previous.

Incidentally, I experienced similar problems when I started running AOL 6.0,
which is why AOL 5.0 is what I use. Who needs flashier email?

And yeah... I plan on getting a real ISP soon.
