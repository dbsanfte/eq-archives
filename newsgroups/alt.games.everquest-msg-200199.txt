I don't know of any items that modify your melee skills, pretty sure
they're all capped at 255.

RBG is around 15k, I think, on my server. You could always head to Seb
and try for one, but it's pretty rare from what I've seen. Random drop
and in a lot of time in Seb, I think I've seen two drop. 

Alternately, maybe go for a Sash of the Dragonborn in HS, not quite as
good but it's pretty common. We seemed to get one almost every trip to
South Wing. You'll need a rogue to get you in but the zone is a blast
for a high 50s group with what are still some nice drops. 

Last option might be Fellspine in SG (34% haste?) if you're feeling
kinda suicidal. If you don't know the zone, it takes a bit of getting
used to, usually involving summoning corpses from far down below <g>.
I've duo'd what I think is the camp with a 65 sk but it was a near
thing on a couple of fights, the ones where the sirens would mez me
before I got all the mobs slowed. Then again, we were pulling 3 and 4
at a time without any kind of crowd control and there really wasn't
any need for that except boredom.

A good group of around 60th lvl can hold 4c. I'd bring an enchater
though, the casters can be annoying if you don't have Mez or a good
stunner. I've never seen the staff drop but haven't spent all that
much time in 4c. Judging from the name, it might drop off of the Amy
Knights at the very top though, in which case I dunno if one group can
do it. We camped the top with 10 people recently and it wasn't much
overkill even with a 65 cleric and 64 enchanter. Don't think I'd try
that w/o a really good group of low 60s. 

Rgds, Frank
