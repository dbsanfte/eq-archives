We chatted a couple of times a year ago or so.  You were in the middle of
your 4 month long /auc WTB Prestine Dragonscale Breastplate (or something)
and I /chatted with you to admire your tenacity :-)  Longest auction request
I ever saw...month after month... wtb...

I miss you folks too.  Like a good book, the memories will live forever.

>> did he post on these boards...?

I lived on these boards a few years ago :-)

These days, Orlun lives on the Sigil forums by day
http://www.sigilgames.com/ dreaming of MMOG ideas and enjoying actual
developer feedback.   By night, Orlun still lives... although he is a level
5 dwarven warrior blacksmith in Horizons.   There is rumors that Orlun the
rogue will be resserected for true in WoW for a stint before he finally
settles down for keeps in Sigilquest.   :-)

Orlun

ps  A few weeks ago, I actually got Aradune to refer to Sigil's new game as
Sigilquest! ROFL
