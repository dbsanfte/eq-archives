EQ weapons can not be sorted into a list. Period.

The idea is no go.

Gear is reasonably situational, both in terms of the mobs being fought, 
and the other gear currently being used. (e.g. a haste sword might be 
golden to someone without a haste item, but irrelevant to someone with a 
better haste item. Similarly some players need some stats and resists 
more than others depending on what else they are using.

Sometimes you want a light fast weapon (to proc or to generate aggro) 
sometimes you want a big slow weapon (to reduce aggro generation, or 
minimize the impact of a riposting damage shielded mob for example).

Add to that much equipment is no-drop or lore, so you can't 'bump' 
necessarily bump it to  other players either.

And finally some players who quested for 6 months to get some item may 
not want to just hand it over to someone else, and highlights that 
player acceptance issues are a separate problem from the technical ones.
