Hehe, if were talking about high places, check out the firt big mountain in FM
when you come from DL.

There are some nice Iksar statues on the top which im sure 99% of EQ players
never seen. Only found them by accident when chasing a giant.
And when youre there, try to see the northernmost lizard from behind, he have a
sword in his had, but from that angle it looks like its something else he have
in his hand *s*
