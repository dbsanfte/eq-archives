Just when I though Verant had it together and might do something right they
come up with this fiasco.  I reminds me of the old days before Kunark when
anything and everything did go wrong. Now in one night they have reverted to
that situation and maybe worse.  I find it doubtful that this is entirely an
overload problem, as overload should not stop the patch server from
disconnecting when turned off, nor is it apparent why the game should come
with a DirectX 8 install and require Direct X 8.1.  All this leads me to
believe that there are massive conflicts in the programming that are going
to take awhile to fix and that perhaps the download or world server is
simply not powerful enough to handle the demands of the new code.  It seems
to me that is Verant is expecting its player base to make substantial
revisions in their hardware, it might be wise for them to do the same thing
with the download and world servers which in the past have been one of the
weakest links in their system.  Hopefully, I will be proved wrong and when
the dust clears tomorrow all will be fine, but for now I doubt it, and
wonder if Brad was not wise to get out when he did and that somewhere he is
laughing himself silly as his former cohorts try to work their way out of
this mess.
