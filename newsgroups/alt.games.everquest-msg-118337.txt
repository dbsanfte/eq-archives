So, we ought not destroy life to survive? You realize that rules out
vegitables, too...

Biologically, our bodies are made to digest vegitables and meat. Our
bodies require the nutrition from both. Yes, there are substitutes,
but that doesn't by any means make it "wrong" to eat meat any more
than it makes it wrong to eat vegitables.

By the way, there's a difference between the behavioral quirks you
mentioned and self-preservation (feeding) habits.

Mm. Convenient.

Again, convenient. "Comfort". "Willpower". Amazing how humanitarian
convictions stop short at those cutoffs...

Do it for health reasons, but don't fool yourself into thinking you're
doing the world any favors by being a vegitarian.
