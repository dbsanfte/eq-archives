Book of Dark Bindings can be found in the Necro Guild in W. Cab.  Cost about
10pp IIRC and you need it starting at level 16.  As for the Concordance of
Research quest, i think that is just to pratice you research skill to get it
up to a descent level before trying it with you words.  I personally never
did the quest and haven't failed any of the spells that I researched.  I
keep on putting pratice points into it until I max it out for the level that
I am at.  As a side note, get a list of the spells that you can research and
the words required.  Start looking now, some are hard to find.  Nothing
worse then hitting a level and not being able tohave your new pet because
you can't find a Word of Extinct.
