}Now an additional question.  Has anyone tested whether the faction boost

Faction modifying items (such as the Amulet of the Haven or the Ghoul 
Lord's Scalp) generally only change how one, or a few select, factions 
perceive you.  So probably, it will only work with the key factions in the 
major city in GoD.
