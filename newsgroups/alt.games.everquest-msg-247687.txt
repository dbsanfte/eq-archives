When I was playing a druid I used to do that in the commons ppl would 
zone in and scream camp check and I'd yell DRUIDS! So they wouldn't kill 
them. I'm sure I'll be inundated with copy-&-paste-kid about how that's 
against a rule or something and have parts of the TOS hurled at me but 
*shrug* I imagine I'll manage to survive.
