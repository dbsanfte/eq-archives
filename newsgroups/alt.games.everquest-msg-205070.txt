Laws come directly from social mores.  Without the morals of society, murder
would be legal everywhere.  Drugs, everywhere.  Gang-fighting, everywhere.
Gambling, everywhere.  Prostitution, everywhere.  Theft, everywhere.
Slavery, everywhere.  Ponzi schemes, well, you get my point.  (Ok, some of
these would not be so bad.)  All of these come from the morality of the
local society.

See
http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/customer_service/cs_rules_of_conduct.jsp.
Rule 2 says "You may not use any sexually explicit, harmful, threatening,
abusive, defamatory, obscene, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive
language."  That would fit with your EQ rules = Law.  Rule 4 states, "You
may not violate any local, state, national or international law or
regulation."  Many states and localities have obscenity ordnances that would
prohibit some of the speech that you would want to say is OK.  And, claiming
ignorance of the law is not an excuse.  It may get you a warning without any
other sanctions, though.

Under the PnP, "5. You may not harass others.
"Harassment is defined as specifically targeting another player or group of
players to harm or inconvenience them. As harassment can take many forms,
the EQCSR involved will make a determination as to whether or not a
"reasonable person" would feel harassed and act accordingly."  If you don;t
care about what you are typing for all to see, some could construe that "as
specifically targeting another...group of players to...inconvenience them".
It would be a stretch, but interpretation of rules and laws is an art, not a
science.

I am not saying that you cannot engage in these activities, do it in
tells/group/guild mode with permission of all.
