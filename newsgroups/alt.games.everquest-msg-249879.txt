In the "Books vs. No Books" debate, your position is clear.  The question
that is more interesting is whether or not you think long-distance travel
could have been implemented better (and by better, I don't mean in the real-
world sense, I mean in the game-world sense).

Or do you like Norrath precisely as it is, with a great deal of mostly
abandoned content, no effort on the part of newbies to earn such
outrageously easy travel (other than coughing up the dough for the
expansion, etc.)?
