Yes, that was curious. I keep a stack of fishing bait on my character at
all times. (Heck, I even have it in my magelo profile). When I go
fishing, I make sure to buy more when I'm done. And when I'm not
fishing, that stack of Hintol's magical fishing bait is what stays on my
corpse if there's not rezzer immediately on hand.

Well, unless you want to count that ugly little incident in Seb two Trak
raids ago. Tarre summoned my corpse from Trak's lair to the Seb entry
hall. I looted it while standing next to a 62 epic Cleric. I mean, I
*LOOTED* it.

I just love doing several days of level 56 all over again for no damned
reason.  Raid brain... what can you do?

Nice of you to point it out, and so calmly too. I had already blown over
the previous poster's message because of that, and wouldn't have even
followed the conversation had you not done so.
