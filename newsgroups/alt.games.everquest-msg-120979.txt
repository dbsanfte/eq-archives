From some of your current posts, I'm tempted, but let's give you the
benefit of the doubt, shall we?

Ok. So you've been playing "on and off" for coming up on four years and
you've never even heard of the city of Thurgadin? Unless "on and off"
means five minutes before you open your christmas presents each year,
and no other time, then yes, you'll be on the idiot list.

Please inform us (without names, of course) as to the class and level of
your five highest characters. I'm curious how you don't even know of the
existance of that city?

Have you been paying the full subscription fee this whole time? Good
gawd, man, you could have been spending it on golf and had a two
handicap by now, given the time you must have spent playing!
