Im a halfling druid, with a human cleric friend, both 19.
We  have been hunting together only since around 15.
I have only killed a few bears and wolves, as I heard its not the done
thing.
Cleric has killed many bears and wolves in early levels around East and West
Commons.
While buying my 19 spells from Druid Ring merchant in North Karana, cleric
was peacefully sitting and waiting, when along came a wolf.
Wolf attacked Cleric, Druids attacked Cleric, Cleric died! I didnt even have
time to watch...

So questions are,

1, Is this a faction thing caused by Clerics early life of wolf bashing?

2, If so, can faction be improved, and how?

3, Or is it just that wolves will attack anything sat down, or even
standing,  apart from Druids?

4, Had we been grouped at the time, would Druids have also attacked me?

Any help would be appreciated as Im sure when I am high enough level to be
able to port group, the last thing I would wish is for any to be attacked on
arrival at Druid Rings?

Thankyou
Gibbakk
