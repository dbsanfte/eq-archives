I'm pretty sure your theory is correct.  I've done several experiments
involving cases where the server and my UI disagree on how much mana or
hp I have, and my UI updates only when forced to consult the server.

For instance, one experiment showed that the server tracks whether you're
medding (sitting) on a much finer level than the UI.  The UI updates your
mana once per tick, based on whether you're sitting or standing at that
moment.  I drove my mana way down, then set up an auto-fired hotkey that
made me sit down for a second just in time for the tick.  The UI showed
my mana going up as though I were medding the whole time, but when I cast
a level 1 spell my mana went down by many hundreds as the server updated
the figure on my UI.  Similarly, if I sat for five seconds and stood up
only for the ticks, the UI though my mana went up very slowly but when I
cast a spell my mana went UP a whole bunch.

One particularly annoying case (for me) is that the server and UI seem to
disagree on how hungry I can be and still have mana regen.  If I'm really
really hungry, I can't med or even get the 1/tick base regen, though spells
and items can still restore mana.  If I'm only a little hungry (just hungry
enough for my Stone of Defiance charm to activate), I get normal mana
regen.  Somewhere in between, the UI thinks my mana regen has stopped, but
the server thinks I'm okay, so when I cast a spell my mana goes up.
