To both you and hughes: The only "free speech violations" covered by the
First Amendment are restrictions imposed by Congress. Your employer as a
right to restrict anything you may say that would affect the company's
image. Many companies require that new hires sign a confidentiality
agreement as a condition of employment. These often restrict the employee
from discussing anything regarding the company in a public forum without
authorization from the company.

Thus, if an employee writes a letter to the local newspaper saying that the
company is somehow responsible for the death of another employee, then as
far as the Constitution is concerned, the company has every right to fire
the employee. Of course, we have whistleblower laws that will probably
protect him.

It's like I tell my brother (he never listens to me, so this is a constant
argument) the only reason that network television is censored is because
they censor themselves. There is no government  board keeping tabs on them
and if they wanted to they could start playing shows like "Oz", for example,
tomorrow.
