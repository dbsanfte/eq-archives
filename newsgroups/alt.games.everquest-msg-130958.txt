Hmm.  Why not both?  What is so inconceivable about an agency that is both 
accountable, and corrupt?  As longas you're only accountable to people who 
agree with you... 

Similarly and more importantly, I think it would be easy to be an agency 
that is both accountable to no one, and yet retains its integrity.

Hmm.  Doesthatmakeme a Sociocapitalist, then?  Or just a nut?
