I was checking out the different flavors of aviaks last night, and I had 
the darters pinpointed. I hunted the bandits along the river edge with 
my druid friend long ago, and they gave some really decent cash, if that 
hasn't been nerfed. I guess if I go there, I need to brush off my 
harmony. It's been a long time since I used it. Ok, I'll go to EC and 
kill bats, then wander over to SK and give it a try. I'm fairly 
cautious, since I hate dying, so hopefully I can avoid Cracktusk and the 
other guy (can't remember the name) who regularly pummels the unwary. 
Unfortunately, I have a tendency to freeze up when things start going 
badly, but I almost always remember that running can be your best 
friend, and knowing where the guards/zone line is is second in that line.

thanks,
geo
