The general rule is that a mob of level L gives this much XP: Z*L*L.  Z is
the "zone experience modifier", and is 75 for a typical outdoor zone.  Z is
the thing that Verant tunes to make some zones give better XP than others
with the same level mobs.

A level 60 and a level 52 get the same percent of an AAXP bubble from a kill
of a level X mob.  However, the level 60 can presumably, all other things
being equal, take the mobs down more efficiently, and so while the XP per
kill is the same, the level 60 should be able to kill more per hour, and so
will get AA dings faster.

(One complicating factor: there are bonuses for fighting yellows and reds
now.  For a mob that is between 52 and 60, the level 52 player might come
out ahead because of that, although I'm not sure if the bonuses apply at
level 52)
