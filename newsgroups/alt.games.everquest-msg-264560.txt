I do agree with you that the multiple names lighting up is a disappointment;
I'd rather get the nasty surprise.  As you say, that's one thing that
separates the good pullers from the bad.

However, there is something new in the system that definitely will require
smarter players versus button mashers.

I've now started grouping in some of my forays and I'm already seeing
something that shows a new version of lack of skill.

I didn't read the start of this thread, but I assume that the "heroic
opportunities" were described.  However, a quick recap:

I'm a fighter.  I have an assortment of skills / abilities to draw on during
a combat.  One of them, Kick, starts off a "heroic opportunity".  If Kick
gets through, I have a limited time to fire the next one in the chain, Wild
Swing.  If it gets through, I again have a limited time to fire the
(currently) last one in the chain, Taunt.  If *it* gets through, then some
effect goes off.  Which effect is chosen by the first 2 actions seems to be
randomly determined, either Crushing Anvil, Sky Cleave, or a temporary buff
I've forgotten the name of.

Now, here's where the skill is concerned - all the group members have the
same "heroic opportunity" running, whether or not they have skills that can
be used to respond to it.  And responding with the start of your own, or
with an inappropriate action, *kills* the opportunity.

Thus, I'll hit Kick, up comes the next step, and the mage fires off a spell
that cancels my sequence.  Or, he starts up his sequence, and I accidentally
cancel it.  Further, I've seen some squences start up which the other person
is the only one who can finish it, but he never does.  It sits there
counting down while he does nothing to complete it and get us some extra
damage.

Some of the sequences that the mage starts can be finished by him or by me,
and others require finishing steps by both of us.

In the long run what you'll be looking for is not people who can just
perform their own class actions in a useful manner, but who also are skilled
at the *group* actions.
