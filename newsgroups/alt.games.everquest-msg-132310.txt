First of all I got in,  in the middle of this post so I don't know 100% what
is going on.  However I know that the Imbue line of spells is at the very
least diety restricted.  (I tried to scribe a spell from Brell as a Cleric
of Tunare and was not allowed to do so) so it is **possible** that the
scribing of a spell could be restricted by race also.
