  If you're out of mana, you should be sitting down and medding back 
up--or if things are *that* bad, feigning death and (if you're a high 
enough level) getting ready to summon corpses and/or resurrect people. 
Necromancers suck copious amounts of ass at melee past the very earliest 
levels. They do piddling amounts of damage and when hit, go down like 
someone paid to take a dive in the first round.
