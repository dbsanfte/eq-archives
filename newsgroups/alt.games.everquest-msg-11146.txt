Can't speak for any servers besides Xev. I took a number of screenshots of both
CT and Firiona, the Unicorn, etc.  Was planning on processing them when I get
home today during patch time and posting them to our guild's website. Sadly,
that's members only, but if there's some outside interest here, I could
probably throw them up on my personal homepage for a while and post a link
here.

I think the fact that it *is* so accessible is why Verant chose it. It would be
available to people of most levels, not just the uberplayers. (As in, had they
chosen to hold it on the Plane of Fear, or something.)  And I can also see why
they might not bother to continue to do so. I was sickened by the whole thing.
