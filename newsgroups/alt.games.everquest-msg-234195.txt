Ok, I was look in google search looking for a place I could play
everquest for free. I found a few different ones. But I do not know
with one will be best. I will like to find some servers that are very
close to EQlive server. I know they can not be exactly like EQlive but
they have to be some that are close. So if someone could give me so
services that are free and have some servers that are very close to
EQlive place tell me thanks. Have a good day.
