Please explain to me how this is unlike a pet beating on an engaged
mob "forever" without the pet handler getting hit back?  The "nerf"
cry, if it exists anywhere outside SOE, amounts to whining that a
melee class has the ability to significantly hurt a mob without
direct risk to the character (an ability the Beastlord class was
given when it was created).  Endless Quiver is stupid, and it may
be that the damage a high-end Ranger can do is somewhat out of line
(maybe, I don't know), but what the hell does that have to do with
whether arrows break root?  Personally I think any damage (including
DoTs) except direct melee should have a chance to break root, but
that doesn't make it sensible to address a possible balance issue
with high level Ranger damage output by weakening some unrelated
aspect of the class.  Why don't they just do something sensible like
make EQ have a small (say 5%) chance of failing?  And while they're
at it, why don't they refrain from making any other changes so that
they can actually tell what effect their tinkering has, instead of
dumping a boatload of changes in and hoping that it'll all work out
ok once they've finally dealt with oversupply of bugs their shotgun
approach almost always produces?
