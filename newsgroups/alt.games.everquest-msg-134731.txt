You could be, if you would drop the concept of cradle to grave welfare,

Rot - you are displaying a typical liberal guilt complex. No one ever got
anywhere sacrificing themselves.

We dropped the third world debt to

None I hope. It promotes irresponsible behavior when you do not pay your
debts; and your debtors hate you for stealing their pride.

Self interest is the noblest interest. Yup every body is jealous because
America is so sucessful.

Tsk tsk. Whatever happened to the people that gave birth to Nelson,
Wellington, and Drake, ruled an Empire so that the sun never set on the
British soldier, gave some democracy and a sense of Britsh law and justice
to the world, and stood alone against Hitler. Did you become  wards of a
liberal nanny state where only the govt can do anything and now your are
unable to fight anymore? Surely not? I have watched you Parliament and it
seems the only question I hear is " What is the govt going to do about this
or that." Can you not do anything for yourselves anymore? Seems all you can
do is crticize and act supercilious. How sad for a once great people. My
greatest fear is that we will become too much of what you now are. A guilt
ridden giveaway socialist.
