 Ick.

Shroud of Veeshan from Phara Dar
Idol of the Underking from Master Yael (?)
Mask of Fall from Aaryonar

the only relatively easily obtainable one is probably the Mantle of
Gunthak, but they drop on mobs in Hate's Fury, so I have no idea how
difficult they may be to obtain.

Off hand, I'd see how much the IH-4 items (the player crafted pottery
one, Ceramic Totem of Rathe?) and shoot for that if the price is
comparable.
