Not to hijack the thread completely here, well, OK, maybe that is the idea
here.

I first saw them when I went to see Sinead O'Connor and The Chieftains.
Sinead and the Chieftains did not play together, did separate sets, were
never on stage together.  GBS, whom I had never heard of, was the opening
act.  They completely stole the show.  I have been a rabid fan ever since.
Unlike Sinead, they did come out and perform a couple of songs with The
Chieftains at the end of the show.

Seven Nations?
Dougie MacLean?
