I know I want to play a big mean Warrior.  I know people will say pick the one
I would have fun with, but I would have fun with either one, they're equally
big and nasty.  The question is, statwise and ability wise, which is better? 
It seems I can get them both to 90 agi and 80 dex.. at that point, the Troll
has 118 str and 137 stam, the ogre 140 str and 132 stamina.. is the 5 extra
stam worth sacraficing 22 str?  Is the regen worth losing not being stunned
from the front and the smaller exp penalty of the ogre? Anyone with more
experience than me have a clue.  As I said, all other things equal.. I would
enjoy either equally.
