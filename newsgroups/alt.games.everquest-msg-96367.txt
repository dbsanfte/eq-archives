While I am not a Necro, I have a Druid and an Enchanter.  As you get higher
up in levels, the money gets better, the key thing is...  penny pinching
and picking only the spells you need critically first.  For Enchanters,
jewelmaking is what will help finance you, but you focus heavily on
collecting and selling all the junk you can.  For Necros, best
recommendation, given you have a skelly pet, harvesting.  Even though the
spiders are green, harvesting silk from them will help out, same with wolf
skins and such.  Small change, over time becomes better pocket change.
Like for my most of my characters are Wood Elf/High Elf.  I milk Crushbone
as much as I can for the bracers, cloth armor and such.  For DEs, it would
be the snake skins, possibly fangs, but definitely the eggs.  Wolves, the
skins.  Not sure what else is there, but the thing is... You will be
looking seriously at milking whatever parts you pick up that sells.  It is
all small change, but better than just letting it rot with nothing to show
for it than experience.
