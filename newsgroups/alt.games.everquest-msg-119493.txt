You're confusing me.

I have been under the impression that time to rez expires is only
calculated while a character is on-line. Hence, if I die at 4 am, I
can log out and wait until the next evening when my favorite pet
cleric is online to rez me.

I also understood that the decay timer runs based on the 'corpse'
time, not the player time, so no matter what I do, eventually the
corpse will decay if I don't get back to it.

Am I incorrect?
