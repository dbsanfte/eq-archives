My only character is a level 14 druid.  Often I will observe players in battle
who
are in trouble.  I take great pleasure in helping them.  Perhaps that is because

I came to know this game through my ten-year-old.  We play it together often,
but he started it a few months before I did.  He would always tell me I should
"give that person strength of earth" or "skin like wood that guy" or just "buff
him quick, he's about to be killed."  He wants to help everyone, and because
of that I guess I do too.

Norrath is not so different from the real world in this regard. IMHO.
