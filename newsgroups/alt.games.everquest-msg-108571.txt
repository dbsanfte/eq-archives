Yes, he introduced variables.  What do you want him to do, make two level 
5 warriors with maxed defense, the exact same armor, weapon, and stats, 
and prove that they do in fact perform remarkably similarly in combat?  
You have to introduce some sort of variable in order to do -any- sort of 
interesting experiment at all.  He changed a few variables, then measured 
a few variables.  He observed that the 'AC' variable he measured did not 
correlate directly with the 'being hit' or 'taking damage' variables, and 
in fact in at least one case could result in an inverse correlation.

You do not have to have n equations and n variables in order for it to 
still be an interesting experiment.  It is possible with even -one- 
equation and n variables to determine some limits (or, more relevantly, to 
determine that expected limits are violated) on the behaviour of those 
variables.

}suggests that those variables are a *bigger* impact on the test results than
}the actual single variable he wanted to test.

So what you're saying here is that his experiment also reaffirms what is 
common knowledge, and that you have some sort of problem with this?  He 
was trying to prove that the tested variable had little or no impact.  How 
is other things having a bigger effect contradicting that in any way? 
*boggle*

}No, actually he wants to test whether a quarter and a penny come up heads
}the same frequency of times.  The penny he flips high into the air, the
}quarter he drops flat onto a table from an inch high.  If you bias the tests
}enough, you can in fact prove that quarters never ever land on tails.

I knew at the time it was not a perfect example, which is why I included 
the bit about the weighted coin at the end... but your example suggests an 
even better one.  Do the exact same experiment you have described... But 
the object of the experiment is not to prove that quarters never ever land 
on tails, but to prove that, through some variation in the act we refer to 
as 'flipping', it is possible to cause a coin to land the same way up 
a biased percentage of the time.  And the penny's a good control, but not 
strictly needed. :)

Common sense would dictate that if you have a higher AC stat, you would 
perform better in combat.  Beetmi proves, through variation of levels, 
armor, defense stat, etc, that it is possible to create a character that 
unexpectedly performs worse in combat despite having a higher AC stat.

Common sense would dictate that a coin will land heads up 50% of the time.  
It is possible, however, to 'flip' the coin differently, or modify the 
coin (soewhere I have a two-headed quarter... :) ) such that an unexpected 
non-50% heads condition occurs.

And if you still don't get it, mate, there's no hope. :)
