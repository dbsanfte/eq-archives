I have XP Pro as well.  Perhaps my video is involved, it's a laptop with 
a GeForce4 Go.  Or perhaps it's something else.  Fortunate that this 
patch had an uninstall available.  I'm just concerned that they will 
roll it into something that doesn't.  If no one else has this problem I 
guess I'll go ahead and install the patch on my other machines and see 
what happens.
