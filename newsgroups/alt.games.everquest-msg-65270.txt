Of all the complaints Ive seen the 'forced upgrade for those not buying
anything' is the one with most merit. Since contract cant override statute
if the messing around breaches trading laws it dont matter what you have
signed with Verant. Also since they have taken cash from some people thy
may well have a case...even if only for a refund for the time unavailable
to them. ie a month or two on a 6 month perpay. Most games that are
ultiplay of the Quake/halflife etc mill allow the use of seperate
non-publisher owned server so are in an entirely different class.

Now certainly many old games which run on older OS's and have multiplay
through the game and publisher are having to maintain legacy servers for
their old customers..especially if the game is still trading on budget
(otherwise n the UK they'd breach trading law)....It would be good to see
an old direct X/win95 legacy server maintained..static in time yes but
still available. Given its pay service then Verant has even more of a
issue especially with the requirements printed on the still currently sold 
trilogy (and I can see that getting them and their vendors in trouble in
the UK) combined with the fact that its multiplay only......this is
especially reinforced to my mine with the way that UO managed its
significant changes in gameplay.

On the other hand I know of no other game thats lasted as itself (rather
than truely advertised second gen material and new games) in such an
unchanged format..UO is the closest comparison and I dont think its fair
to compare with the 3d First person perspective and the required kit to
use those features..so it is something of a ground breaker and alone in
its field for its type, longevity and structure and hence how to deal with
the increasing requirements needed for the player driven demand for more
content etc and the capacity currently available for such new toys. Just
imagine if rather than release SoL and patching it on they decided that
things had gone far enough to justify an EQ2.....thats their ony other
real option.

While I'd suggest that upgradig is going to be worth it I would like to
see a legacy server established for those who are on older tech.
