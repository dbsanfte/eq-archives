I HOPE this was from Velk's<--->GD.

GREAT!  I asked to be last buffed during a Vox raid last night
so I wouldn't have to camp.  I've been having trouble getting
BACK with any character, LD or not.

> - Pets no longer pace.  Pets will now, when close to you, STOP.

I like that.  I don't even have a pet caster, but this is nice just
to see 'em settle down.

Yay! No more setting up a Naggy raid and finding out he was
killed 8 hours ago by the French Resistance </jk>.

I also like that.  Nice to actually have the chance to put that Legchopper
in place of a cockatrice beak :-).

I'm stunned.  WOHOOOOOO!

This is nice, too...no more worries about Faydedar NOT despawning and
NOT tracking in to the Iksar Master.  That was a 9-10 hour CR for some
folks last week.  At that point, you're not even worried about getting an
exp rez, you're just not wanting to lose your epic due to corpse rot :-).

That's GREAT!  Now you actually need the portal stone, and you don't
have to worry about getting ported just by running through at a bad time
(which doesn't happen, but I do know folks that have ported up by
accident while waiting on a friend).

/target Jobaber
/assist
;-)

Nice for smiths.  But I'm wondering about "limited supply" and how that
works?  A real lame-o will camp by the vendor before a patch and buy it
all up until next patch, I guess.

> - Batwing Pie, Bug Bites and Deadly Medley now exist

Can't wait to find those recipes.  Bug bites particularly sounds fun.

> - Increased the drop rates of cultural armor temper components

That's always a good thing.  Most cultural armors aren't worth it for
many races anyways, so I'm glad to see them make it easier for the
few cultural smiths out there.  I've still got 9 terrorantula silks in the
bank because I can't find a person who tailors culturally as an Erudite,
and I don't want to trash 'em because I know how rare Terrorantula
silks are (components from ONE rare spawn mob who only drops
a few at a time? That's just stupid).

Yay!.

That's just stupid.  I know why, it's because you could single pull
Phinny to the zone line in Kedge with an Eye.  What was dumb was
wizards have been complaining about  the eyes for 3 years now,
and they just changed it out of the blue.  Find a bug, tough luck.
Figure out a way to use a useless spell, it's an exploit and it will
be fixed.

> - Charm is immediately removed from charmed NPC's when the character that

That's great for bards, too (I hope)...good control of when to release
charm.

> - The damage component of Elnerick's Entombment of Ice no longer causes
the
> spell to have a chance at breaking its root component

That's always a good thing.  I remember not long ago how
druids NEVER used root because not only did it break snare,
but the root itself was often broken on the first tick from the initial
damage component.

No more Explulse Summoned on Lava Crawlers in Lavastorm.

It's about f'ing time.  It doesn't even really affect me much,
but not being able to charm a level 2 rockhopper with my druid
in Shadeweavers because "that spell only works on animals"
really chapped my ass.

> ** Zone Related **

This should be fun.

Faction with dinosaurs?

I know a bard who did some SERIOUSLY fast leveling there with
his AoE song because of that.  A LOT.

> - Added content in the Umbral Planes to make it more... entertaining

Seeing the oomlauts and then VI saying the word "entertaining"
scares the hell out of me.  Looks like I  won't be heading to
Umbral anytime soon.

"Entertaining" probably means 3 Death Touching mobs
at the zone in.  And a necro in the middle of the zone that
casts "summon corpse" on all people Death Touched.
Right next to the Soulbinder who randomly casts an
AoE "Bind Affinity" spell.
:-)

That's good.  "Where'd we get all these extra froggies?"
:-)

I see some REALLY sore vampires in the future...

But no, they still won't allow  you to pass the caps.  So you still
can't pick the N. FP bank door at level 40, you have to wait until
51, so nyah nyah :-).

All in all, nothing earth-shaking (besides the corpse timer...THAT'S
worth a 12 hour patch if it works correctly), but a decent patch.

No complaints here, and I AM looking forward to seeing reports of
what's so "entertaining" about UP.
:-)
