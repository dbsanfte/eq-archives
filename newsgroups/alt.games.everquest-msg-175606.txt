I can't vouch for the accuracy of those numbers, but, I understand that the
ZEM has been pretty well proven to exist with ShowEQ.  Each zone can give
you a different amount of xp for killing the exact same mob.  The amount of
xp you get is based on the level of the mob, what it cons to you, the zone
experience modifier, and your group/raid status.

That's often why people gravitate to certain zones.  There are other things
to consider, some types of mob are much easier to kill than others that are
exactly the same level, so, sometimes, it may be worthwhile to go to a zone
with "easy" mobs even though the zone modifier may not be as high.
