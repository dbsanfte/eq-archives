    He COULD be a dwarf cleric who didn't bring AGI up to 75 at creation,
and thus takes a 40 point AC hit. :-/

    As for AGI gear that doesn't suck as bad as Serps - try to find a
Bloodstone Eyepatch. All/All, drops in Mistmoore in the garden area (so not
as dangerous as the manor proper), weighs point one, and with AC 4 AGI 3 WIS
3 it's a pretty fair face item.
