I didn't say anything about rejecting a Ranger from tanking.  I stand
by my assertion that without extreme twinking the difference is quite
noticeable.

Significantly less HP intrinsic to the class, less AC on chain armor
than plate, inferior damage mitigation.  Unless you're twinked to
the point where mobs have a hard time hitting you (in which case the
AC advantage of plate gear is meaningless) it'll take more healing
to keep a Ranger up and you've got less slack in the way of HP when
things go sour.  That doesn't mean that a Ranger can't tank, or that
you should sit around with your thumb up your ass waiting for a plate
tank when there's a Ranger ready to go.  It does mean that, again
barring extreme twinking, a L35 Warrior or knight who has a clue how
to gear himself is going to noticeably out-tank a L35 Ranger against
appropriate level mobs, and the difference keeps growing from there.
