Yes and No. The point that I was trying to make is that when people state that the
TCC is there to stop farming, they are making a mistake. TCC does not stop farming
but only makes the worse offenders of farming that much more profitable. Farming
occurs when something has value to other players. The restrictions that TCC places
on zones, and subsequently the items that drop in those zones, increase the value of
those items by decreasing the number of suppliers. It gives the worse offenders of
farming, those with multiple accounts or large guilds, exclusive rights to the items
that have just now become more valuable since there are less suppliers. Standard
economic theory. Decrease the number of suppliers, you decrease the supply. Decrease
the supply and not decrease the demand, you increase the price.

Why do I ask? Past history has show many examples of items being placed in zones
that are clearly better then that majority of high levels can obtain else where. The
Droga zone is a premire example of this with the Idol of Thorn which is clearly an
item that should not be place in that zone. Yet it was. If future zones that plan to
be added are added with the TCC in place, it is extremely likely that a repeat
occurance of the Idol of Thorn example with Droga would occur but with the fact that
this time not everyone can go get the item. If Lucin is released with all of its
glorifed items that will attacked you and I to buy that expansion, there is a very
big chance they will place the Idol_of_Thorn_2 in some kitty zone on a mob that is
green to level 30 player. But if Lucin comes out with the TCC in place on that kitty
zone, you and I will not have the chance other then by buying it to gain that
Idol_of_Thorn_2. And if that item is like the Sleeves of Ancient and happens to be
No Drop, you and I will never have a chance to get it with our main character. Every
person that comes after us will have a better item then we could ever possibily
obtain. Is that fair? Is that right? IMO, it is not.
