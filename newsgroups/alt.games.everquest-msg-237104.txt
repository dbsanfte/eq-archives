At your level GoD isn't going to give you anything, even in the 50's
I'm not sure how good it will be.  From what I've seen so far its sort
of a combination of LDON in terms of Instanced zones & PoP in terms of
charachter flagging for zone progression.  Just like PoP its a race
between the major guilds to progress as far & as fast as possible. 
There are some nice quests turning up in the inital zones (stuff is
green / Lblue to 65 but hits pretty hard!) but I havn't done any of
these yet.
