Its a sorry Fact that Verant doesn't consider that being KSed if Cyrystic
hit Furgul first. Verant belives everything is Fair game no matter how much
work or time you put into a quest or camp if someone engages the final NPC
before you do its theirs, and if a GM witnesses you trying to outdamage him
could get a warning about KSing.
