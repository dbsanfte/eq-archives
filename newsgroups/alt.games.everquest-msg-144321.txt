Developers who actually want people to *use* the their sites
will make them compatible with *any* browser, no matter how old.
If a programmer spends 50% of his time trying to achieve this, he
must be doing something wrong.

When I find a site that just won't load with Netscape, I move on.
Several web retailers have lost my business because I couldn't
use their sites with Netscape 4.78 any more.  The more savvy
businessmes still get my dollars.  It's a competitive world; and
web developers that want to 'show off their chops' will do so by
allowing their clients to maximize their profits by catering to
the whims of all possible customers.
