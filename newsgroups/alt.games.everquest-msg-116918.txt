This is wrong.

Valor of Marr is 25%, my level 35 Shaman twink's haste spell is 30%
(Enchanters get it at 16, it's only 1 or 2% less when they get it) so
it's hardly surprising your self haste is overwritten by Quickness
using Verant's "interesting" spell stacking rules.

You are correct in that it only lasts about a third of the time
however, sucks when you're grouped with 5 melees (plus Dogdog) who all
chime in helpfully "haste down!" at once...
