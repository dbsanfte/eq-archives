Sounds as if the board is faulty to me. I put A7V8X in to replace a NEW
Leadtek board, and it works great, no hiccups whatsoever on a 2100XP+, 1GB
RAM win2k. Absolutely clean install, so perhaps you have a Monday board?
Don't need to prejudge a line of boards, but it hurts when it's your own
cash that's gone and your decision.
