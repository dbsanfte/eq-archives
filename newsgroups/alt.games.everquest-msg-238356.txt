Usually that's a good policy. For the most part though if SOE ever
shuts EQ down the CDs won't be useful for anything except coasters
anyways. 

And as long as SOE is running EQ you'll be able to get the software
via download. Basically, despite shelling out for the expansions and
getting a disc, you are really just buying a license codes. The data
on the physical disks is an obsolete snapshot of the fileset well
before they ever hit shelves... so SOE will always make the complete
_current_ fileset available for download since you can't connect and
run (stably if at all) without it.

So in this case, (and for other subscription based games that have no
single player or non-server multiplayer playability) owning the CDs is
pretty much a non-issue unless you happen to live on a 28.8 modem...
in which case they can save you some time.
