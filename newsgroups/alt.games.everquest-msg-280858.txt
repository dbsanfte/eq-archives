Agreed. And the hardened scammer won't blink. But theres no shortage of 
"criminal mastermind wannabes" who fold the moment their victims bite 
back.

I've known people running multiple boxes who've accidently activated the 
wrong account with a new expansion, and SOE CS has been gracious enough 
to resolve it with them. In this case CS should be willing (with some 
persistance) to at least move the expansions to a legitimate account he 
owns.

Precisely. Didn't I say that? Lol... no I didn't. I'd intended to. It 
was to be one of the acceptable "settlements". Scorched Earth!! If I 
can't have it NOONE CAN. :p

Actually it is strictly true. He purchased the expansions for his own 
usage. SOE has delivered them to another party, and presumably refuses 
to transfer them to an account in his name.

If I buy your computer, and expand it with a new scanner... and it turns 
out that the unit it really belonged to your company and they'd reported 
it as stolen, and the police swing by to confiscate it: 

The original owner doesn't have any claim to your scanner.
