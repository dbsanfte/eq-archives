I have found the best places to do drop transfers are underwater
like in innothule swamp or lake rathe.

Just get both characters there... (get loc of spot)
/sit and /camp first character with item then then drop item when you have 5secs
remaining, then quickly log the other character

I just transferred a groaning mace to my beastlord from my mage this morning.
Didn't use the underwater trick tho...
I just found a out of the way spot behind a BIG rock and dropped there... and logged
Bst and got it
