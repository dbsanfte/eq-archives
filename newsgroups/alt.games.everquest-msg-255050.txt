Your referring to an actual raid where the above would be true, because 
all 6 groups are engaging one or two mobs, and only the highest dps 
group gets the kill, while the support groups get zilch.

The scenario in question however is 6 groups essentially doing their own 
thing in Crushbone using a chat channel, vs the same 6 groups forming a 
raid.

The xp will be worse for everyone in the raid.
