Today? hardest to play would probably depend on your play preferences. If
you like to solo, then a tank or melee type. If you like to group, one of
the less appetizing in a group classes, such as...

Hell I don't really know if you are a grouper. I certainly don't have any
class on my 'I won't group with one of those' list. I mean yes I want a
Shadow Knight, Mage or Necromancer, Druid, Shaman, and Rogue to go with my
Enchanter, but I'll live with other combos.

As to why it's so fast? Depending on when you left, things have changed:
Luclin and later zones have Zone Experience Modifiers that are quite frankly
obscene compared to the challenge of the zones.
Below level 30 and in a dungeon? 2x experience per kill
Below level 10? 2x experience (which stacks with dungeon stuff. Little low
level dungeons are an express ride to 10 now. In Blackburrow I dinged from
1-5 in less than 30 kills testing a customer's machine to make sure their EQ
works. The only thing they do.)
They took out the experience penatly for hybrids. Shadowknights now earn xp
faster than they did before. Trolls still have an XP penalty for race
though.
Hell levels (30,35,40,45) are a thing of the past.
The group bonus has been really pushed up.
Total group size-Bonus before split
2- 20%
3- 40%
4- 60%
5- 80%
6- 80% but, instead of splitting Xp from a kill 6 ways (each gets 1/6 the
kills XP), they split it 5 ways to 6 people (each gets 1/5 the kills xp).
Under normal, non-incompetent-git circumstances, it should never hurt your
xp rate to add a 6th person to your 5 person group anymore. Even if it
doesn't speed you up one bit, it won't negativly impact the amount of xp you
gain.
Note I could be wrong there on the percents... I have not poked my nose into
that in months and months.

Finally, if you left say, 2 years ago, the game has become something
completely different than what it was. The additional spells and improved
equipment available to everyone has radically altered the balance of the
game. Even if you yourself don't have access to Luclin and the Bazaar, the
other 5 group members most likely do, and 3 of them are likely 2nd or later
characters run by experienced veterens of the game, and twinked if perhaps
not twinked to the gills.
