Buy from players?

Sarnak Ceremonial Chestplate, off of a rare spawn in Trak Teeth on
either the Hunter or Forager table, I forget. Costs something like
4-5kpp, gives regen (5hp per tick)

Fungus Covered Scale Tunic, off of the Myconid Spore King in Sebilis,
rare spawn rare drop. With the nerf to the drop rate it was going for
nearly 50kpp recently but rumors that it will be level limited have
pushed the price back down a bit (on some servers). Gives regrowth
(15hp per tick).

There's others, but if you had to ask the question, you'll probably
never see them.

Buy from Vendors?

Bark potion costs about 10pp. It roots you but gives you regrowth
(15hp per tick).
