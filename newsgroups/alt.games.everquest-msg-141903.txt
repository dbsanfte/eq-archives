How long do you 'blackscreen' after the splash screen after character
select before you get control of your character? If they're found a way
around loading 100s of map images into memory at login, and having them
sit there on the offchance you might want one, I'll be interested to
fiddle around and find out what they did.

It's quite possible, given EQ's fickleness for systems, that they are
still being loaded at the login time, but your particular system just
handles it better. Some people with awesome specs can't play with models
on, yet others with mediocre systems can play comfortably at 1200x1600
full models particles and spell effects. There's no real rhyme or reason
as to why.
