Just got this in the mail today:

"Greetings,

As a Lords of EverQuest(tm) player who took advantage of our offer to
participate in a special phase of the EverQuest II(r) beta, you DO NOT
have to apply for the beta on May 3rd, 2004.

We will send you an email in the future which will contain additional
instructions and information pertaining to the special phase of the
EverQuest II beta that you may participate in.

Thank you for playing Lords of EverQuest, and we look forward to your
participation in the EverQuest II beta.

-Sony Online Entertainment"


Any bets on how many days before the beta is over when this "Special"
phase is? Mine is 4. I wonder what would happen if I applied on May
3rd anyways.
