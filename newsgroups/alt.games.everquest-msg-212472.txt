I actually think you have managed to explain what you are trying to 
convey, the problem is that I don't agree with the conclusions that you 
come to as a result.  In fact, I feel that your argument brings about the 
opposite conclusion from what you are concluding.  As I understand it, 
you are saying that God created the entirety of the space-time continuum 
at once.  To me this means that there is even less possibility of free 
will, as everything is laid down in stone, so to speak, at the moment of 
creation.  No, I don't mean moment as in a moment of our space-time 
continuum, but rather from God's point of view.

If, instead, God created the entire universe at the beginning of what we 
call time, and allowed it to evolve from there, then, if we assume that 
he is not omniscient and omnipotent, then we can indeed have free will.

You are right however that I don't see much more being added to this 
particular topic, but rather, we are just restating our viewpoints.
