 Depends on if I have a Ranger nearby. If I can get Strength of Tunare
then I will go with SoV. SoV doesn't stack with Monk Epic but I can live
with that if I have SoT as well. If there's no SoT then I will request
VoG. It's getting hard to find an Enchanter that will cast VoG though
once they have SoV.
