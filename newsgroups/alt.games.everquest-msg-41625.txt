Yeah.  I sniggered hard at people who predicted the end of the world for New
Year's Eve of 1999 or 2000.  Let's see: we have a completely arbitrary
calendar based on when some dead religious guy supposedly lived and which is
inaccurate in that regard; the fact that at the turn of every century -- and
at several random points throughout -- you get these doomsayers who are
utterly certain the world will end; and last, but not least, the fact that
IT NEVER HAPPENS.  Funny how these wacko groups consider their calculations
to be irrefutable until they're proven wrong (by nothing more involved than
the next dawn), and then it's a case of, "Well, we made a mistake, HERE are
the irrefutable calculations!"  And, miraculously, the error they've
supposedly made is always a minus, never a plus.

The world's ending tomorrow?  Your Holy Scripture says so?  It has never
been proven wrong?  Call me a skeptic, but I'm making plans for next week.

D, whose theory is that the world will end in approximately 5 billion years,
when it is engulfed by Sol's nova stage.
