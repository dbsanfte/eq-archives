     Mobs swim as fast as they run.  You won't outswim them unless
they are snared.  I have seen a shaman's unsowed pet swim as fast as
the sow'd shaman ran with levitate; normally the pet would not have
kept up.

     It's like deciding that, since the mob is almost dead & I have
full health, I'll jump off this 500 foot cliff just to watch it splat.
The mob will follow you but it won't take any falling damage.
