Neither.

You need 2K mana at minimum.  If you have 2K, you'll be able to cast MGB.
If you have between 2K and 4K of mana, then all of your mana will be used.
If you have over 4K of mana, then only 4K will be used.

You do not need to have a full mana bar.  You just need to have medded up to
at least 2K.
