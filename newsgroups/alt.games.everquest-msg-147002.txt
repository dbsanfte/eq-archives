Which skills you do and don't need to put a point into confuse
me quite a bit.

I've played a druid (a different one) to 20, a wizard to 24,
and a mage to 30.  I'm almost sure I never put a point into
Channeling on any of them, yet I vividly recall the Channeling
skill going up.  (Okay, I'm unsure about the druid, but more
sure about the wizard and mage -- are wizards and mages born
with the basics of Channeling, whereas druids are not?)

Also, I never put points into 1HB, 1HS, etc.  I know must people
immediately dump 5 into one of those skills, but I don't even
put one point in.  Yet those skills also eventually jump to 1,
then 2, then 3, etc.

I've also been working on Tailoring a bit.  Never put a point
into that either, yet it's rising.

Is there a definintive list of skills you need to put a point
into, organized by class, out there somewhere?
