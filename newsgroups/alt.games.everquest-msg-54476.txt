Clear the castle in Crushbone and have it there.
Clear the spec tower in Oasis and have it there.

If you can get an enforcer squad to protect the guests, the Combine spires
in Dreadlands.

Or the Ice bridge in Velious (safe except for trains)
The inside of the Ry'gorr fort if you can get enough force together to keep
the chief and his cronies dead, as well as the avengers.
One of the empty ice halls in Crystal Caverns, or the Stalag terror stairs
as you come out of Frostone toward the Geo tunnels (right past the broken
bridge)
Or, the ready made wedding hall in Tower of Frozen Shadows, just make sure
you evict the wedding in progress, hehe.
