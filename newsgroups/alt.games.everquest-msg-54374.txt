Nope, you did not read it all:
http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/policies/naming_changes.jsp

"Conditions for Surname Changes:

Customer Service will change a players last name if the player
requests a change provided that the player is level 20+ and either the
surname, or the combination of the first name and surname requested
does not violate the Naming Policy.

The player is level 20+ andï¿½

Either the surname, or the combination of the first name and surname
violate the Naming Policy. 
Is getting married or divorced. 
Is entering or leaving a guild or family that shares a common surname.
Doesn't have a surname yet, or wishes their current surname to contain

The top part seems to suggest what you said, but you read on and it
says exactly what you need to modify it.

Oops okay now I see that the part I put in above is only on the page
with teh naming policy changes.. I guess they forgot to name it "old
policy there."

Okay The new page does indeed seem to say you can just change it for
whatever:

"Conditions for Surname Changes:

Customer Service may change a players last name if the player requests
a change provided that the player is level 20+ and either the surname,
or the combination of the first name and surname requested does not
violate the Naming Policy."
