You know, every time someone brings up this topic, someone else posts
something like this. I've petitioned a couple names before. I do it
first of all because it takes a whole 3 seconds, and second because
life is all about rules. If Verant had said 'Name your character
whatever you want' then I wouldn't care. But they didn't. Why should
someone get to break the rules that everyone has to play by? Want to
know what the last one was? An iksar monk with the name
Vegetathelizard or something like that. And I'm not sorry I did it,
either.
