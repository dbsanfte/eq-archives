I can see the argument about having to group is a good thing, last night our 
group had one of each main class which was great. The problem is the 
uncertainty of can or do this solo or must I grp for nearly all quest.

As for doing quest at the appropriate time often it is hard to be sure when 
the exact correct time is to get some xp but to be doable even with colour 
coding.

Perhaps it is me being moany but EQ2 seems to give you too much mob info but 
there is such a small difference in lvl wether it is a no xp and likely 
death.

Well I am going to log on now and decide wether to hunt solo or get a big 
group for Anders Blackhammer or a group for many of my other quest)
