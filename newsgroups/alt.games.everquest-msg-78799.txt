Druid warrior falls apart at the higher levels unless they stick to
animals exclusively. The druid will be forced to blow all his or her
mana and they will end up with downtime no matter what strategy they
use, other than fearing. Using yours, against L35 or so and higher
monsters, the tank will need multiple heals. Making the fight faster
(and reducing the damage the warrior takes) just means the druid is
using mana on dots or dd. Either way the druid ends up fairly low on
mana, low enough to need medding time beyond what is really efficient
for most other combos. (This does assume no or low level of twinking)

Druid mage was better.
