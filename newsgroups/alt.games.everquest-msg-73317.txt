Last night while helping rez folks out of VP, I found a new bard song bug, 
and I wonder if anyone else has seen it.  I was singing my level 55 mana 
song, Catata of Replenishment, and I was seeing the correct icon, and the 
correct song message, but my groupmates were getting another icon and song 
message.  I stopped and started the song, but they got the same message.  
One of them camped out and came back, still the same issue.  It finally 
cleared up when I camped out and came back.
I suspect it had something to do with the fact that I had been singing one 
of the new AE resist songs, but will need to do some more testing to 
narrow it down before I /bug it.  Has anyone else seen this or similar 
problems?
