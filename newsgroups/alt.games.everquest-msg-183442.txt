I guarantee that this is the first time DT and I have every been acused 
of being in the same "clique". No offense to DT, but we have not exactly 
seen eye to eye on more than one occasion. I was just enjoying his (or 
her? come to think of it, I don't know) toying with the poster. You, on 
the other hand, appear to have a very quick trigger - hmm, perhaps I 
should throw that particular stone.

Sure, we become a bit familiar with each other. Don't think that amounts 
to picking out china patterns together or anything. When you post, you 
put yourself at the mercy of everyone else's mood at the time. Come 
correct or risk getting flamed. I still get flamed on a regular basis. 
Get over it and stand by your opinions or settle for lurking.
