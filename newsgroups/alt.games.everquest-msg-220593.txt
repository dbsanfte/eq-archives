When I went to see Shrek, I was sitting waiting for the film to start
when a woman walked up and told me that her granddaughter thought I
looked exactly like Hagrid.

Given that we see Hagrid riding a motorcycle in the first movie, it's
a fairly good match.


By the way, you could have found this out a while ago as I'd put that
same picture up on www.eqfaces.com (Reyder Axeman on Xegony) and told
you lot about it.
