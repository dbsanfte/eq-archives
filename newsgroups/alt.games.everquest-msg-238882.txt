You were playing with morons then.  They had crap weapons.  They
didn't know what the Taunt button was for, so they avoided it (maybe
it was red, who knows?).  They were'nt casting at the start of the
fight.  Initial aggro on the puller is a bit extra, but a single snare
from the Ranger (along with actually turning on auto-attack) would
easily overcome it.

No, in hindsight, the second time you pulled and they didn't instantly
take aggro off you, you should have said "sorry guys, but I can't tank
AND heal AND pull all at the same time... I'm a grouping Cleric not a
solo Shaman...  I'm outa here" and gated away.

I can't imagine how the Shaman could've been using a level appropriate
slow without pulling aggro, from the way you've described the action.
