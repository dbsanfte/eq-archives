Well, the cleric is better at HP/AC, not sure how druid and shaman
compare in that department. Enchanters are your competition for the
other buffs. Basically, I think the important thing is to keep track
of what buffs enchanters can do and how they compare to yours.

I think the massive buffing role of the shaman is one reason a lot of
them don't know how to heal in a group - they've left it to clerics or
to druids. Few things irk me more than being grouped with a shaman who
won't chip in on my work as primary healer if needed, giving me (and
as a result the entire group) more downtime between hunts.
