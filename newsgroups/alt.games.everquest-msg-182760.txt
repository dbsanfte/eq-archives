I've noticed the people with absurdly low prices are generally stuck up a
pole or even inside a column!

With the assistence of a guide who summoned one out, i traded anyway, but
it's very frustrating and i can't petition every time. Still it was nice to
make a killer profit out of someone who seemed to be cheating the system.

I have 2 questions of this community:

1) How do they get themselves up there? It must be deliberate because their
prices are radically different to the main. If the problem occurred
randomly, surely their prices would have a normal variation?

2) How could the bazaar be changed to stop them doing it? removing the
poles?
