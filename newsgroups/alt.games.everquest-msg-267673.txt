Well, last time I posted here I was grumpy as all heck and my posts were
rather acidic to say the least.

For those who like to believe in karma - you will be happy to know that very
afternoon I started passing a kidney stone. Man - I have never had any pain
like that before. I didn't know what it was so tried to put up with the
abdominal pain for 3 hours before I started to realise I was in danger of
passing out - so I went into hospital.

Fearing the worse, ie, that the Doctor would pull my finger and a huge fart
would rip out and I would be left feeling like a twat for coming into
hospital for gas, I waited 3 hours to see a Doctor. Of course, the pain
vanished completely as soon as the doctor walked in the door. Typical, I was
left feeling like an idiot telling the doctor that I felt quite fine now
actually and it was proberly just gas or a monster shit brewing so sorry for
all the fuss.

I felt even stupider when she started ordering tests anyway - blood, urine
and catscan.

My nightmare was mounting... *assume Doctor Hibbard voice* ..."I see what we
have here, a case of one almighty noxious fart brewing. Ehehehe" - but to my
surpise the Doctor tells me I should have headed in right away as it was a
kidney stone.

Eh?

Doc: "The good news is you have started to pass it"
Me: " And there is bad news I take it?"
Doc: "The bad news is that there is 3 narrow places the stones can block at"
Me: "Don't the kidneys empty into the bladder?"
Doc: "Yes"
Me: "So this thing has to come out my pecker still?"
Doc: "Yes"
Me: *mega wince*

Anyway - I better get back to drinking my evening bucket of water whilst I
await the next two "narrow places the stone can block at"...

>.<
