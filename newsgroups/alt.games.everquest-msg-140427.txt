Periodically the Grimlings take over in Hollowshade Moor and the Owlbears
disappear. This is a real hassle for those of us who depend on Owlbear
products for our livelihood.

Is there any way to prevent this?

I've heard you can kill the grimling king to reset the whole thing but is
there any way to prevent it before they take over?
