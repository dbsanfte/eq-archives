Theres only one serious flaw with that pricing scheme and that is that
different pieces hold different values to monks based on how hard or easy it
is to obtain similar items.  For example, a Tunic is AC9 or 90pp by your
pricing strategy, but I can obtain a Formans or lockjaw for less and get
more AC and stats.  On the other hand the Pants are AC6 which you sell for
60pp, you simply cant find anything under 300pp around with comperable stats
for that slot.  Same goes for the Cloak and the Slippers.
