I'm leery of enticing into EverQuest someone whose idea of
leaving a game he doesn't like is to start swearing and
trying to make the lives of customer service and the people
around him miserable.

This lack of empathy for the human beings at the other end
of your keyboard (maybe not even fully realizing that there
are other human beings there) is an online sociopathy
brought about by the freedom from social consequences that
anonymous Internet interaction seems to be cultivating. It's
the reason for newsgroup trolls and flame wars, among other
things. It's obviously nothing near real-world sociopathy,
but even so, I'm not sure we need more people like this in
EverQuest.

But maybe answering your post will serve some benefit to the
other readers of this newsgroup.

The chief difference between EverQuest and the games you
mention is the orientation around teamwork in EverQuest.
Verant has realized that the real benefit of having an
_online_ game is the possibility to create challenges that
can only be overcome by cooperation among small to large
groups of people.

Most (social) human beings garner an immense satisfaction
from being part of a team that accomplishes something that
no single human being could have accomplished on his own.
The strength of this concept (coupled with a variable reward
mechanism) is probably the reason why EverQuest is more
popular than the other MMORPGs before it, and continues to
successfully fend off new copycats.

One of the essences of teamwork is specialization. Each
person on the team must have a role -- must provide
something that no one else provides. The inverse, when
everyone is equally good at everything, makes each person
just feel like a "human resource" who is interchangeable
with and replaceable by anyone else from the vast pool of
people. This is the reason for the class system.

Given a class system in EQ, you can't have one god-like
character who is the be all end all like you can in UO. Any
class you choose will have strengths and weaknesses. Your
job in a group (should you choose to group) or on a raid (at
high levels) will be determined primarily by your class:
Clerics are the acknowledged healers; Enchanters reign
supreme at mob control; Warriors absorb damage, etc.

While there are some classes that excel at self-sufficiency,
Necromancers and Druids for example, the tradeoff is that
these classes are often less desired for groups and raids.

The economy, which you ask about, is quite strong in EQ.
There are numerous rare and powerful magical items that
players continually buy and sell from one another. And good
gear is one of the few ways that players of the same class
distinguish themselves (other than pure skill at playing
their class). However, like all good economies, top
equipment in EQ is not easy to come by. Getting the best is
only accomplished through a significant investment of time.

Also, if you want it, there is music in EQ.

There are many things to do besides powerleveling in EQ,
such as the huge array of quests, but most of them don't
yield power or cash. So if you're looking for a shortcut to
the endgame, you most likely will be disappointed.

Equipment never wears out in EverQuest, but there is a
robust trade skill system that can used to make (mostly) low
end equipment.

Characters are (thankfully) pretty well locked within their
class abilities because of the class system, but you may
have up to 8 characters on each server if you want to
experience variety.

If you enjoy the Hobbesian spirit of random murder in UO, I
recommend playing on one of the PVP servers in EQ.
