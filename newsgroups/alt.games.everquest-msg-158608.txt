I worked on the Spiders along the west wall from zone in.  They are all
clerics or shamans.  Ice Comet hit for full force everytime.  Fire hit 50%
of the time, also they were invulnerable to the pullers arrows, but it did
cause aggro.

High MR and not stunnable, but snare-able

Bring a shaman with you, need to slow these buggers and the tank best be
bashing/slamming or you have to kill them two or three times.
