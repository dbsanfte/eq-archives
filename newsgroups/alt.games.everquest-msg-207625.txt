One more caveat:  I've run into a number of people who
began to have very frequent computer lockups or EQ crashes
after they upgraded to an uber video card.

After a lot of experimentation, we found that the
problem was, basically, their older CPUs couldn't keep
up with the faster video card.  As soon as we "detuned"
the video cards by turning off their 2x (or 4x) "turbo"
modes, the problems vanished (and video performance was
still lightyears beyond that of the old video cards
they had replaced).
