Was one in SK over the weekend and as far as i could tell just in the
area around the aviaks.

200+ normal green con skellies and zombies spawned, was nothing but a
kill fest and everyone was soon ankle deep in undeads. These mobs dtopped
normal loot for their type so the necros in zone were happy at least.
