Aye, and even with all this knowledge, I still almost died to a damn
named Druid yesterday.  Saw a long-time friend, ran over to say hello
to him, was talking when a cat started attacking him.  I backed up and
DoT'd the cat, then went back to talking to him.  A few seconds later
a bear started attacking him.  I didn't think, just backed up and
DoT'd, then got smacked hard by the druid.  I was able to get Selos up
and run away with about 1/2 bubble of health left.  I'm starting that
think that druids are up with Troll guards for my least favorite folks
in Norrath.
