I wonder if the ground spawn points listed are accurate. When I was
after Misty Acorns, I started a list of the locs where I found them,
but several people told me that the locations were random, and so a
list would be useless.

At the time, I wondered if that was true - Verant traditionally has
trouble with the Z-axis, and randomly placing the ground spawn would
require taking that axis into consideration.

Maybe I'll hunt around at the locations you referenced sometime, and
see what kind of results I get.
