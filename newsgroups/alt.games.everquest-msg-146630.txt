I was surprised to see you quote John Adams in
support of your view. 

"The doctrine of the divinity of Jesus is made a
convenient cover for absurdity."
John Adams

Adams also signed the Treaty of Tripoli. Article
11 states;
"The Government of the United States is not in any
sense founded on the Christian religion."

Do you have any evidence that it was founded as a
Christian nation?
