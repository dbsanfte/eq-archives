Nope. 75 is only critical for Agility because you take a HUGE
ac drop if its even 74, approximately 40 ac at level 60. 75 or above
is fine, in fact it hardly matters above 75.

Casters realm is pretty much right. Max stamina, then make agil a
minimum of 75 (possibly subracting some from sta if you don't have any
points) Everything else is fine. Dex hardly will play any role and
people certainly don't notice a detriment at 70. Besides that, even
cheap bazaar gear you are getting for AC/STA/HP for sks will often
have other things on it like agil/dex/int or anything else. A MOSS is
incredibly cheap in the bazaar now and has 10 int (mace of shadowed
soul)

Sta ends up being it, since its the only stat that really goes
directly into something noticeable that won't be raised by normal
SK gear so much.
