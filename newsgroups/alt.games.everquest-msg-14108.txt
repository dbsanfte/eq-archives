I couldn't agree with you more, Zach.

I'm planning my own dragon raid, and there are quite a few
possible tactics I'd like to try that seem perfectly reasonable
to me (i.e., they are the things I would attempt if I were
actually going to fight a dragon), but about which I constantly
have to try to second-guess whether Verant would view them
as tactics, or as "exploits".  Sadly, the more clever the
idea, the more likely it is to be considered an "exploit"
just because it is so unorthodox.

And it's not as simple as "asking Verant first", as another
poster suggested.  I know if I asked 10 Verant reps, I'd
get 10 different answers.  And even if all 10 said some
variation of "that sounds okay to us", I could *still*
get screwed if a GM who happened to observe the raid
came to a different personal conclusion than the 10
I happened to ask.

As you point out, trying to walk the line between
clever tactic and damnable exploit can be tough when
Verant doesn't even want to spell out exactly what
they consider to be exploits.  Verant's Catch-22 on
this matter isn't new with the Conquest flap, it's
so typical of them that here's a cartoon published
LAST YEAR on the very same problem:
   http://www.penny-arcade.com/view.php3?date=2000-10-11

Nor is it good that Verant likes to insta-ban people
for disagreeing with Verant's judgement call about
what's an exploit and what isn't.  It makes people
*really* nervous, which wouldn't be the case if
first or second offenses just got a "don't do that"
and a *clear* explanation of what people shouldn't
do in the future.

As I tried to explain to Verant several times before they
shut down their open forums, their real PR problem isn't
the nerfs or bans, it's about trust -- when they do
not sufficiently explain (or even attempt to bother
to justify) their actions, the player community
justifiably becomes nervous about what might
happen *next*, and whether it'll happen to *them*
next.  That sort of "walking on a minefield" feeling
is not conducive to happy customers, but Verant
has never made any effort to defuse it.  Usually,
in fact, their behavior only throws gasoline on it,
when a slightly different approach could go a LONG
way towards reassuring people instead of making them
even more apprehensive.

Verant has some of the most ham-handed public relations
I've ever seen.
