Now that's just mean.  Though I would like to have DC to use on him, I bet
he could tear through a spectre or SG even with full buffage (potc,
regrowth, 70% haste, sow, str, DS)

That said, once I get my archetype AA down, I plan on doing Innate Camo
first, then DC, then either Exodus or back to archetypes.  Probably do SCM2
and MC2 in arch first though.  Of course I'll need the obligatory run3 and
regen3 in general before that =P.

I really wish that Enhanced Root didn't suck, Quick Evac isn't much better,
when compared to Exodus, and MGB for druids is pretty much useless,
especially since shaman (who have much more use for MGB) get group regrowth
(and our BP click RotG doesn't work with MGB), SCRM isn't much better than
MGB either.  Other than Innate camo and Exodus, none of the class AA are
really all that great, DC is nice for showing off and VERY situational, I
guess Quick Damage could be useful, but I'd say it's a waste of points
unless you're grasping to get the Elder title (as opposed to the wonderful
Venerable title, which makes me think of herpes and gonorrhea, though I know
those are venereal =/ )
