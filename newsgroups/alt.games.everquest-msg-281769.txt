Until the new default UI came out I was using the slider timer at 
http://www.timermod.com/.  I didn't care for the new UI so I went back to 
the old one.  Now when I try to load the timer I go back to the new default 
UI.  The timer still works with the new UI but I don't care for the UI.  Any 
one have a fix that will let me use the old UI and the timer?
