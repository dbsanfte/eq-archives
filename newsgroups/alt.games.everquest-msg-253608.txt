Think monk without feign, rogue without backstab, ranger without utility.  I
think monks are lacking right now, but I think berserkers make monks look
good as far as having a class role.  In a game where the pure melee were
already complaining about severe balance problems, adding another pure melee
was just stupid.

As with most raiding guilds, on non-raiding days the twinks come out in
force.  There were several berserkers early on, a few that lasted a while,
two that made it into the 50s, and only one I've seen online in the past
month.

Just max out stamina.   =)

I always miss out on those bankers that are converting gold to platinum at a
