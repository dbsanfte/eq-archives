Right.  If you believe you have free will, you do.   Having someone
else know -- in advance -- the resulting decision doesn't change
it.

Object lessons are often for other people.  The death penalty,
for instance, is supposedly an object lesson:   if you kill someone,
you die too.   It sure doesn't teach the person to which it is
applied anything;  it (supposedly) does other people.

Yes and that's the whole basis of the argument.  You CAN
choose either way;  you have free will.   Foreknowledge of
a choice doesn't remove free will.

You're assuming the lack of free will.
