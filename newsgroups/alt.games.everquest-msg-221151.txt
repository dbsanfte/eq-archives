I'll start by saying that I'm not completely up on the details of the 
"unholy monk nerf". That said, didn't it mainly have to do with damage 
mitigation? If that is the case, I would have to say I think it was a 
good idea. I mean, a monk should be highly skilled at *avoiding* getting 
hit. However, once a blow lands, it should hurt like hell. After all, 
they're wearing nothing but a robe or cloth tunic. I can't imagine why 
monks should have much tanking ability at all.

Correct me if I'm wrong here.
