Is anyone else having problems with their log files?

I looked at mine today, which has been running since the birth of my
current main, and it just stops at July 30th.  No new entries after
that.  I started a new character this weekend and the log file doesn't
even exist for her.  I checked my ini file and logs are still set to
true.  So I was wondering if anyone had any ideas.
