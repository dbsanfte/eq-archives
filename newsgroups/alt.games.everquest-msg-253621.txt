Down is not up. Locked is Up but not accepting logins from most accounts
(accounts not flagged as getting passed locked). Most common reasons for a
'locked' state:
1. Fully up, but they are testing and don't want to endanger character data
on a potentially unstable machine, or allow 'ploiters' into the possibly
still exploitable playground.
2. Fully up, but the GM's want that Vox kill without having to share. ^_-
3. The world server is up but not enough zone servers are syncronized with
it yet for it to start allowing logins (needs 85% of the zones available
iirc).

Ahh the things you learn being a beta tester/test server player.

Since FV is it's own rules set, they may be having to test on it, rather
than bouncing Test Server every 5 min as usual. And it may be more difficult
due to (from what I understand) Test server actually has coded in tools for
testing, amazing as that may seem sometimes.
