Let sleeping dogs lie. Let your conscious be your guide. A bird in the hand
is worth two in the bush. We can keep going if you're going to push your
absurd I'm winning theme.

I'm not arguing at all... except about your notions. Because certainly
*you* don't know it. Neither do you know that the reasons you're giving
that "EQ2 Killed EQ1" are valid. They're circumspect and based on
assumptions and unknowns. And if you can't see that then you're not as
bright as I'm giving you credit for. I'll quote your number five to get you
started: "I'm going to take a wild stab in the dark, and guess roughly 0%."
Pretty solid numbers there, huh?

Hey nice sideskirt of the issue. Do you, for a fact, know what the planned
lifespan of EQ1 was? If so, what else can you tell us was going through
Brad's mind at the time?

And you're saying it isn't? I'll rebut that right now. Without *choice*
capitalism can not and will not work. How and why would one design a better
product when the choice is taken from the public to purchase said product?
