    I imagine they boosted stun resists to create more need for snare and to
try and make paladins less of a standard choice for LDoN groups. But since a
resisted spell generates almost as much aggro as an unresisted spell, and
people prefer paladins mostly for the ability to lock a mob onto the
paladin, the issue remains.

    And yes, specific spell lines can have higher/lower resists than other
effects on the same resist. Think of the Pacify line - no change was made to
it in terms of resist mods between when it was useless and now.
