Yep, that's why I chose Iksar for my Necromancer.  :)

Iksar regen can't quite keep up with Dark Pact when you're standing,
but you don't lose much health.  When you're sitting, though, your
health will regen (slowly) even with Dark Pact going.

Thanks for the Paineel suggestion, I'll try it.

: One of the biggest pains with Iksars is finding places to shop, so any
: new faction is good!  

It's a non-trivial handicap to overcome, but I think the race/class
combo is a lot of fun.

: If you can't quest for armor, then buy the good stuff in the Bazaar!

I prefer questing, but I'll buy stuff in the bazaar if necessary.
Something about earning it myself makes me feel warm and fuzzy.
