Well, actually, not true.  There is a bonus for having a group, it varies by
the number of players in the group.  At least Sony/VI says there is such a
thing, I suppose they could be lying, or wrong.  According to their numbers,
you do indeed get an added bonus for that 6th person.  Prior to that patch,
I understand there was a flat 2% per person bonus for a group, varying from
2% for two people to 10% for 6.  Now, they reward you for adding even more
people.

As I understand it, the grouping bonus should apply, and the xp that the 24
druid should have gotten would just vanish, so net effect is less xp for
each of the others than if the druid was not there.  Specifically this is
what they had to say for the January 14, 2001 patch:

Grouping Bonus

Following the next patch, the group bonus will be as follows:

2 person group - 2% total bonus.
3 person group - 6% total bonus.
4 person group - 10% total bonus.
5 person group - 14% total bonus.
6 person group - 20% total bonus.
This bonus is applied to the total experience reward for killing a creature
prior to distributing it to the group.

Many people have pointed out that when killing in a group you get less
experience per kill. This is of course true, but what is often missed is
that you can kill many more creatures, and creatures of a higher level when
in that group. For instance, a good two-person group should be able to kill
things of a higher level over twice as fast as a solo person should. Now,
we're going to give them even more of a bonus for doing so, and make it
easier for people to find pickup groups on the basis of getting higher
scaled bonus.
