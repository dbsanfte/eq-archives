Ok, so being level 45 until very recently didn't give me much of chance
to experience planes beyond Knowledge.  However, with some guild
grouping, I'm now level 48.  So last night a PoN group is forming up in
guild chat, and I got recruited as the tank for the group.

Already this is making me nervous.  I've never fought anything at the
level I'm going to see in PoN, and I've had very (big emphasis there)
little experience being MT/MA.  But I'm game.  It's a guild group, and
they asked *me*, after all!

I get directions, and it's a pretty straight shot, so it's only a few
seconds to get there.  We end up behind the hedge and I get buffed until
 my toes are about to explode out the front of my boots.  Granted, I've
never come close to having 4k hps before, but, as nervous as I am, I
still wonder if this'll be inadequate.

The rest of the group consisted of (if I remember right) mid-50s druid
and shaman, a 60-ish cleric, and a 65 beastlord.  There was a sixth
member, but I can't remember the class off the top of my head.

In any case, we started pulling, and single pulling where we were was
incredibly easy.  Banshees weren't too tough, they were only hitting in
the mid 100s, and rarely doing more than double-taps (triples only if I
have my back turned).  Nettling wraiths were more trouble in that they
hit me in the mid-200s and were hitting me more often.  Even then, the
group had no problem keeping up with the damage.  At least I didn't have
to worry any more about being able to take the heat.

Worry number 2, aggro, couldn't be put away so easy, though.  Once I got
aggro, keeping it wasn't too bad, but getting it in the first place was
difficult for me.  I know I don't have high aggro weapons (a lammy and a
centi short sword), but my beg is a 0, so I have that much going for me!
 Still, I had to take aggro back from whichever caster got it at the
beginning of each fight.

Even so, things went pretty well until our beast had to log and got a
druid for a replacement.  I pulled, someone took aggro, and ran.
Nothing quite like the sight of an elf kiting a dwarf around in circles
- even second hand!  Even that would have been ok, but we also got an
add.  A frantic few (loooooong) seconds later, someone had the bright
idea of rooting them and we got it under control.  One of the druids,
unfortunately, really pissed off one of the banshees - banshees summon.

One dead druid, two dead banshees, and a group recovering on the
hillside.  Who knows what would have happened then, except that the
cleric had to log, so the group broke up anyway.

All in all, it was an...exciting experience.  I learned some things, and
was probably totally oblivious to some things.  Still, it certainly
could have been a worse first outing!
