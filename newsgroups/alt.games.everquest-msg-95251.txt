Also, my druid has decent AC considering I'm pretty much in ghetto
gear anymore.  A year, year and a half ago his stuff was pretty damned
nice, but now after Velious and Luclin....

Anywho, I *MIGHT* be able to stand toe to toe with a CS wyvern for 30
seconds, if I'm fully buffed.  But on the rare occasion that I let
four of them get near me, I'll see a bubble and a half of health drop
off in one ROUND of attacks.  Seems like mobs hit a lot harder when
there are more than one of them beating on you.
