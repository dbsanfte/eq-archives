I was wondering if anyone knew about Sheila. How did you know? I should
think that just calling him that will be sufficient for him to plonk you.

And if I wasn't already in his killfile (from the UO group), merely
challenging him on his gender tends to send him in to a plonking frenzy.

I think we are in for an eventful few months.

(Oops.. I saw she plonked you a little further down the page.)
