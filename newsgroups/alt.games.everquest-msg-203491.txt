Yeah, I had the same experience on Xev too.

Also, not sure which ship it is, but one of the ships going through Erud's
Crossing was sailing through the center of the island. Very disturbing to
be medding on the docks after summoning 4 zillion items to find yourself
sailing through a volcano...

Ships are broken again! (Insert utter astonishment here) Probably something
to do with the new group xp changes >:)
