Not entirely related (to what is an excellent post, btw) but have you 
noticed a fairly large amount of 'childspeak' (as you call it here) in 
EverQuest 2? I've been suffering far too much of it in the game and it 
has sometimes made communication difficult for me.

It could of course just be me :-)
