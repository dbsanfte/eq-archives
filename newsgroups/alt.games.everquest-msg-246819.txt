But ya do. And God help you if you actually step out the door.
Heck, you're not even safe in your home come to think of it. Those 
windows are just glass after all, and we all know how easily glass can 
break don't we? And walls? They're not going to stop a shell are they? I 
don't think so. Time to move underground, disconnect your computer from 
any connection to the outside world. Pour cement in the floppy drive, 
USB ports, CDROM, and anything else that might be used as an input 
device, bye bye keyboard. No... won't work. Someone could open your case 
and put a different HD in or even worse ghost yours. You're going to 
have to encase the whole thing in cement then pour a few more just like 
it and mix them up every few days so nobody knows which one is the one 
with your computer in it and which are the fakes.
Now THAT'S security. Anything less is just pissing in the wind.
