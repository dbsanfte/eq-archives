There is no plat to be had in Oasis- those crocs don't drop much but meat.
The way I'd go, with Gather Shadows memmed, ride the moon to GFay, and run
through BBM to catch the boat to Freeport, then head throught N. Ro to
Oasis. Fewer zones to cross, and the most dangerous part is getting onto the
dock in BBM. Not sure what a Erud necro reception is like in FP, but my
necro inkie butt wasn't KOS even without faction work.

I did Oasis from 15 to about 18, then went to snack on garoyles in OOT. For
a while, I considered leveling only in OOT. One can also do sirens in OOT
around this level, but I'm not sure what they are exactly.

12 to 15ish I camped the Sisters on Sister Island. They drop some nice plat,
and the ocassional rusty Halberd, which my pets LOVED.
