If either of you are ever near Norway, stop by me so I can look at
your eyes :) (I'll be picking a master project for my BA in optometry
next spring, and I am hoping to get something related to either high
grade myopia or colorblindness)
I'll be having a gander at my retinas the next couple weeks, and hope
they look reasonably ok - they're noticeably stretched and right eye
has a fair bunch of floaters, but I am not aware of any actual damage
yet (-10.5 due to huge eyeballs, 20/12 with glasses)
By the way, Sean, did you know that when you look at the world, you
see it 'larger than life'?
