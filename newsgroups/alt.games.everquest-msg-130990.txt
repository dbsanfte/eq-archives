Please don't reply:
1. The original poster likely won't even return to see replies.
1b. Will chance starting flame wars if they do.
2. IF you do reply, at least snip the article, otherwise it is as if you are
helping distribute their message.
3 (most important). Many, including my, news server filters most of this
junk (while not having problems of accedently filtering normal stuff...I
think there might be a cross-post limit or something).  So if no one
replies, we never know it existed.
