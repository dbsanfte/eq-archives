This happens every patch day. It going to be a lot worse this time as it 
is in the middle of the holidays.

I usually forget about patch days altogether and go play squash/sit on 
the beach/go to the pub.

Try it, its much more fun than sitting in front of your PC for hours 
hitting the login button.
