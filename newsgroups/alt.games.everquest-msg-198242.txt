Bleh.. I already typed this once in another thread... /rude OE crashes.

When Jak (my shaman) was doing trials groups, he was level 61 with something
like 8 AA points.
He had a vindi BP and boots, no Skyshrine armour, and mostly a mix of Thurg
and random junk.

Something like 4.2kHP buffed; he did have torpor.

I think he was low end, even for a small guild like yours.
