Be careful! The next time you prick your finger, all those blood cells are
alive and contain human DNA. Don't you let one of them die! You could
POTENTIALLY clone a little you from that blood! And stop picking your
pimples! Every one of those nasty little bumps contains viral material that
is alive and contains human DNA (because that's how viruses replicate -- off
your own healthy cells and by "highjacking" human DNA). Don't you DARE take
any medication that might harm a single one of those viruses! That's murder!
Of course, the virus might kill you, but be brave. You're dying for the
cause.

The "Right to Life" loonies are all about sex. They're about sex they'll
never have because nobody in their right mind would want to mate with them.
They don't want the rest of us to have sex either, or most certainly, to
enjoy it. Most of all, they do NOT want women to have any rights. Even the
female ourangutans who wear print house dresses and call themselves "Right
to Life" (bombers and picketers and snide, vicious, stupid yellers at gates)
don't want women to have any rights over their own bodies and destinies.
Why, if women have THOSE rights then it doesn't give the "Right to Life"
morons an excuse to sit on their fat asses and whine about their lack of a
destiny. There are actually people out there DOING something with their
lives and they can't tolerate THAT!

Can they?
