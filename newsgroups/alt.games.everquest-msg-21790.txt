It's all a non-event to me.

If someone wants to sell their account or an item, they can do so easily,
(assuming it is worth any money), and there is not much anyone can do to
stop it.

Sony might say they will ban accounts that have been transferred, but I
really don't think they want to do it. I think they would rather have the
money coming in from an account, no matter how many times it may have been
transferred. If you were to supply them with incontrovertible proof, that it
had been sold, then I guess they would reluctantly take some action.

The EULA has zero effect on this. Sony can say what they want in the EULA,
but I doubt that most people who have sold their accounts have even read it.
In the real world it is redundant and of no consequence or relevance to the
selling of the account.

They may as well write the Second Commandment in it's place, but if they
think that's going to stop me making a graven image then they are sadly
mistaken.
