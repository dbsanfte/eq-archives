Pleasantly surprised to find this title in my local EB last night, I have
loved this series of games. I have always liked RPG that instead of just
creating a scripted adventure for you create an intricate world enviroment
for you to find adventure in.

The graphics in this game are just draw dropping, they make the Myst series
of games look neanderthal. It reminds me of ray traced images images except
everything is happening in real time. The down side of this is that it is
lucky I have an EQ SoL capable machine as I was looking for features to turn
down to pick up movement and frame rates. This is on a Athlon 1.2GHz, 768mb
pc133, GF3 ti 64mb machine too...

The sound was awesome, even the voiceovers weren't grating (well, it's only
been a day) though of course the music got turned off immediately. The
musics not bad at all, and soundwise coming out of a Audigy card it was
technically good - but since when do we play an RPG to listen to it's music?
I had an EQ deja-vu when I left the game running for dinner and a
thunderstorm happened in game, loud as and scared the cat witless... *grins*

I immediately ignored the storeyline and headed out of town to check out the
enviroment. There are different plants and fungi around that look like
integral parts of the scenery which upon clicking in you can harvest
different components for use in the alchemy skill. They aren't just random
"spawns" either, you find the fungi on rotting logs - everything is
seamless. The only thing I could think that was missing from this game was
clouds of insects and wind moving the foliage - but then again I don't have
a Silicon Graphics sticker on my box  so it's proberly just as well.

Well - that's all I better report on so far, because I didn't actually
*play* much in my 3 hours of it last night, I spent ages checking out things
like the raindrop pattern on the water - swimming around inside sunken ships
complete with strewn rotting furniture and barnacles and just watching the
stars appear in the as night approaches. Yes - stars. This simple thing (but
great looking) makes the game that much more immersive.

Anyway - can't wait to get home from work now and I have only been here
30mins, looks like I can take a well earned EQ sabbatical at last : )
