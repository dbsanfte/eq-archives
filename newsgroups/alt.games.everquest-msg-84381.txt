    I, and everyone else who ordered Kunark from their online store, got a
free month or three when the CDs arrived late. Didn't matter if they were
even one day late (like mine was), you got the free play time.

    They have to identify who was troubled first, though. In the case of
Luclin's release, how are they going to identify who was affected? Well, the
one plan they had (we'll refund your account fees in full, and delete your
character) did exactly that. It made sure that nobody that wasn't troubled
by this got a single thing.

    And the issue is making sure you sooth upset customers and only those
with reason to be upset. For whatever reason VI has decided that
accomplishments in game should come with a certain pride. Giving away
accompishments, even ones as small as a few bubs of XP, cheapens what they
don't want to see cheapened. And once you start talking about giving away
something outside of game, like cash or playtime, you really have to justify
why every cent/second is being given away to your bosses.

    By giving XP away to everyone, including people that didn't even log on
during the troubles, they're sending the message that XP isn't too valuable.
They can give it away to everyone, not just the people who got rolled back,
and not care too much. It's the integrity of the game he was talking about.
I'm not sure Mythic should care that the game be taken that seriously - it
is a game, after all - but there it is.
