I don't know if this would work for Clerics (probably not,
they might not be able to put out enough melee damage to make
it worthwhile), but Paladins can fear-kite Spectres pretty
efficiently, since they have Spook the Dead, and Spectres
are naturally a bit slow when they travel anyway so it's
easy to keep up with them even without a Snare.

Fear the Spectre, then run along behind it whacking on its
back with your sword.  Repeat when the Fear spell wears off.
