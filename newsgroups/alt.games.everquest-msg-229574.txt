I wouldn't participate in a lottery either.  I play the game for two
reasons - to escape/release stress and to kill time.  My objectives are
either to gain xp, farm for bazaar or trade-skill work (i.e. make money),
or explore.  My cash netted across all my characters is only about 3k... I
don't have cash to blow on casinos/lottery...  I'd rather buy a bunch of
buffs (I prefer to solo) and get to work...

If Verant is to bring back a casino or lottery, the vendors need to be in
many places - either home cities or in zones in the middle of nowhere,
preferably where you'd have to run through a cpl of old-world zones to get
there...  this way, folks would be traveling through these old areas, and
maybe do some questing, hunting, or grouping since their already there.

New features should be focused at spreading the population across existing
zones - to promote their use - rather than moving the population further
away to new, removed places.

A friend and I were perusing a map of Norrath that came with a pre-luclin
package - there are a bunch of named regions, lakes, features that do not
exist in the game.  These places should be created as zones adjacent to
existing old-world zones, for more advanced players...  Again, the idea to
keep exciting and meaningful game play in the world that we know, rather
than expanding the universe and creating ghost-zones on Norrath...
