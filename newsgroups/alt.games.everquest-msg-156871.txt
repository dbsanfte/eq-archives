>Why don't they just bite the bullet and revise this shit?

Well, I am hoping they will.  It is obvious which zones are underused.  Giving
them a higher experience bonus is great but not if there is nothing worthy to
hunt there.

We still explore.  Once it becomes obvious that we can't hunt an area because
of agro, terrain, whatever, we just move on.  Hence a bunch of empty zones.  
I'm not saying that all zones should be perfect, but EVERY zone should have
SOMETHING worthwhile.
