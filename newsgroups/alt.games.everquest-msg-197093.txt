Apparently you're the all knowing authority of what snot is worth.  My
guild is one of the oldest in the game, but with a high turnover rate
at the high end. It always has been that way... seems most like to go
the uber route.  ALl that aside, you clearly missed the point.   No
class should have to be mercifully pulled through.  And yes, I know
some shammies will write how they got through and were the hero of the
whole group...  Whatever.
