}the piece I swapped the most. Heh. 

Hmm, what can I remember of mine... it's been so long...

On my main, Newbie tunic -> Raw Silk! And then I died and the corpse 
rotted because I didn't understand the rule (because it was misprinted in 
my rulebook! ggah!), but the GM replaced it for me, yay! -> Robe of the 
Keeper (spiffy! I'm a pretty red color now, like the wine I'm named for!) 
-> Advisor's Robe (random present from someone quitting... seemed so uber 
then, -5- whole int! wow!) -> Blackened Crystalline, after much much 
hunting in CC for one -> Insidious Robe (from Hate... I was guest on a 
guildraid, but I was the only Enc there, woohoo! So I joined the guild... 
:) ) I had that one for a damn long time, I really liked being blue.  Then 
they introduced the new models with luclin and I was suddenly consigned to 
being puke green, ugh! - I also picked up a Tserrina's robe, but it 
ended up being mostly a fashion item -> Robe of Dark Beguilement (from 
Nathyn Illuminious in Katta). I was somewhat suspicious that all the other 
guild enchanters ganged up and insisted that I put my name in for it, but 
the +100 cha in one slot has really ended up working out well.  In fact, 
since then I've gotten that pretty purple robe from Rumblecrush and Ornate 
Silk, but I still wear the RoDB most of the time.  Except when I want to 
be a fashion victim or I want the ornate clicky.  I also grabbed Shainai's 
Nightie at some point, in case I ever get married and want to be the 
blushin' bride. :)

But it's amazing how times have changed... so far I've gone newbie tunic 
-> Robe of Concussion (for 15pp in bazaar! What a steal!) -> Robe of 
Tenancy (Think it was about 300pp).  And now I've been having lots of 
computer problems, so I've been mostly devoting my time to accumulating 
wealth in bazaar.  Should I get my old insidious robe back?  It was 1Kpp 
this morning... or do I save up... So many pretty robes for sale on FV. :)
