Math is also absolutely useless for interpreting it's own results.  When the
theory (math) doesn't correlate to the practice (real experience), the
theory must be revised.  In this case, the theory that must be revised is
the thought that simple Damage output is all there is in a group.

There are also those who stick their head in the sand and refuse to rely on
common sense, and observation.  They talk only about their theories and
equations.  They never go out and test them, or experience the world.  They
may have all the money, but their lives aren't very rich.

President Reagan once said that a Keynsian Economist is someone who would
look at real life and wonder if it would work in theory.  I think that
applies to more than just them.

Your math my be great in limited applications, but to be accurate, it has to
bring in all factors (even those that aren't quantifiable).  Restrict it too
much, and you end up thinking that clerics are useless, because they don't
add to the damage output.  Expand it too much, and the equation becomes too
complicated to be useful.
