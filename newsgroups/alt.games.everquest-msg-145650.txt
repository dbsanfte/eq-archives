I have a 36th Chanter on Povar. Hunt a lot of HGs in Rathe of late.

Some slows/debuffs will cause MOBs to arrgo on you. If I use some of the
higher level STR debuffs on HGs, they always arrgo on me, even when
engaged
by tanks. Solution was to drop to a lower level, save type of spell.

Also, I have found that if I sit and the MOB comes to track me down, I
either move
a little farther away to sit, if possible, or cast Memory Blur on him,
then sit.

If that helps you, great!

Well, it is almost impossible to tell the tanks "which one" when all the
mobs are
named the same. The best solution is have a main tank, and everyone (cept
you
of course), use ASSIST!!!! Then, you can target the MOBs not being
attacked (that
includes informing your DoT casters not to DOT the "extras" when they are
pulled),
and mez them.

I do have a hot key for group say that informs the group that I am mezzing
a "%T" (target
mob). This helps quite a bit.

As for the monk, I would have asked him if he has ever even heard of
/assist, hehe.

Hope that helps.

Yep, that is actually a good area to practice Chanter crowd control
skills.

Hehe, nicely said, Londriel, all of it. :)

Again, speaking for recent HG hunting experience in Rathe, Memory Blur is
your friend.

Druid buddy was out scouting for pulls, zone was very crowded, over 30
peeps.
He told me, "If you see an HG, pull it". So, I did.

Tried to root it first, resisted, of course, it zeroed in on me, my death
its sole and
only thought. So, I back up a bit (thank goodness for SoW), and cast
Memory Blur.
Stopped it, dead in its tracks. The Druid shows up by that time and gets a
snare, root,
two uber DoTs and, shortly after, with me Suffocating him and debuffing
him to a feeble
nub, he dies.

Since I could not mez HGs, Memory Blur has become my very good friend. :)

Oh, and you can try this trick with you pet on an HG to keep him alive
longer....

Cast your best Rune spell on the pet. Ensure the HG is rooted. Then,
debuff and
Suffocate (or other DoT) the HG, well out of harms way. By this time, you
will have
to re-cast Rune on your pet. Do so, then move to just within arrgo range
of the HG,
he will turn away from your pet for a bit (not hitting him any more), then
turn back.
You just move out and then just back into arrgo range, then back out. You
could
call it the "Arggo Range Hokie Pokie", in and out of arrgo range. Will
make your
pet last longer, basically making your pets damage a longer lasting DoT,
hehe.

Fare ye well in your travels, fellow Chanter!
