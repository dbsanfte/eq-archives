I don't get this static fantasy environment.  Static in what sense?  Seems
to me there is always new stuff going on, from new quests, new expansions,
and new equipment, and new abilities.  If it was static we would all be 50th
level... we wouldn't have the bazaar, AA points, or even /gems.  Also, how
is /gems part of the "fantasy" environment you want to stay "static".
I think I started coining inkies when i first started, although I have no
clue if I started it or was superceded by others.  The point of using these
nicknames is to show familiarity with these ideas, instead of walking around
clueless.  Camps have been getting nicknamed various things since the
beginning.  Orc hill or trainer's hill in CB is one example.  If your going
to get all upset over naming conventions, your just showing your newbieness
to the whole EQ experience.  You go ahead and concern yourselfs with naming
conventions, and complain when that wizzie is called such or that the local
tree hugger should be called a druid, because its commonly used to call
things by different names, and its not going to stop.  Heck, even Sony did
it to take the term from the Beastmaster movie and use Beastlord instead.
The point should be obvious and moot, but for a clueless newbie like
yourself, you probably want to continue to argue what many people have
obviously pointed out as very hard proven FACT.
