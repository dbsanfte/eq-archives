Popular, yes, but with too great a supply and many easy replacements.

Rogues are competing for a DPS slot against Monks, Rangers, Mages,
Beastlords, Wizards, and Necromancers.  And if you can't find any of those
looking for group, just grab an extra tank or an extra priest and you can
still do well enough.   Nobody sits around at zone because they don't have a
rogue available yet, as they might if they didn't have a tank, crowd
control, healer or slower.

The most frequent response to one of my shouts of "Level 61 Rogue looking
for group" is "lvl 63 rogue lfg"....
