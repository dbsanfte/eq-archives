Pretty much what others have said, yes, you can solo, but not like you could
in EQ. The game is designed to encourage grouping, so it's a lot more fun
and a lot easier to get things done in a group. When you do things for a
quest as part of a group, everyone in the group gets credit if they are
doing the same quest, so it's often easy to find a group to help you.

You can still solo, but you probably wouldn't want to solo your way through
levels 100% as it would get pretty boring. Solo MOB's are usually pretty
mundane, like bears, wolves, beetles, snakes etc.... and there is not a lot
of skill or tactics involved.
