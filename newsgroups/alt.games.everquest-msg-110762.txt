  Everyone should be non-KOS in Shadowhaven and the bazaar.  However, you
will have to do faction work before you can do business with the majority of
Shadowhaven merchants that I've encoutnered (a simple message running trip

  Depends on your class and deity, most likely.  My erudite shadow knight
was KOS in Highpass, but my Cazic-Thule worshipping erudite cleric friend
was dubious.
