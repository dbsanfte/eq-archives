I can't help with your main question. I do know that there is an
Enchanter spell vendor in Shadow Haven, however I cannot find the
vendors name. What spells other then the Luclin spells he/she has is
also a question I can't answer.

If someone can answer who the vendor is, I have another question to
add. I'm trying to get a couple of enchanter spells for a friend. Will
the vendor sell to me? (Wood Elf, Ranger)
