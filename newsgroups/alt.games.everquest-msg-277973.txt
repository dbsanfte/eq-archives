I think tradeskills have dropped from what it used to be.
1. Not as many people are involved in tradeskills since its easier to
purchase items from other players.
2. Most of the players involved in trade skills have moved beyond lower
level trade skills to higher levels skills.
3. There is not that much interest in making the items except to level
up to the higher skills

Personally, I do fletching, and my kids are doing jewelcrafting,
tinkering, and starting up pottery baking.

The sale of basic components is not consistent either from day to day.
Maybe you had a bad night.
