Nice retcon.

Here's the ori9ginal text
/agree This is THE reason I quit the game. I had an Illusion/Radiation 
Controller and on my last day, had a Blaster follow me around and 
after I had disposed of minor gang members and started in on the Boss, 
the Blaster would wipe him out in a few shots and I received little or 
no xp. I petitioned, and the answer was "You have no reason to 
petition, you received some xp" I logged then and there, terminated my 
account and have never regretted it. I probably would have quit 
eventually, but would have given it another month or two. As it 
stands, they got their usually small percentage of the game sale 
price, but no subscription revenue, as I quit within the free period.

He didn't send feedback, he sent a PETITION.
Please provide evidence that Cryptic/the GMs/CS are DELETING feedback.
You keep saying that, but you've never provide a shred of evidence to
support your allegation.

>My whole complaint from the beginning isn't that there is rampant

>strawman that xocyll would have you beleive).

That's a nice strawman you have there since i've never said anything of
the sort.
My consistent point is that YOU want to apply definitions and
conventions from outside CoH, to CoH in contravention of the actual
rules.

>seriously and not disregarding them out of hand as something the player

Gee too bad support never said what you keep alleging they said.

"You have no reason to petition, you received some xp" is not anywhere
near saying "Killstealing cannot occur in CoH".

What was KDragons response?

Was it "But he's following me around and doing it over and over again
and it's really annoying me."?

NO it was: I logged then and there, terminated my account and have never
regretted it.

So KDragon...
1. complained about something that's not an offence.
2. didn't complain about something that WAS an offence and would have
been dealt with had he complained about it.
3. logged off with no attempt to explain the situation.


KDragon did the equivalent of phoning the police and complaining that
his neighbor is listening to Rap Music, when what he really meant to
complain about was that the neighbor was playing his music at a very
high volume, in violation of the noise bylaws.

And when the cop says "listening to rap music isn't against the law",
KDragon slams down the phone and writes a letter to the editor of the
local paper complaining that the police aren't doing their job.

The editor reads the letter, laughs himself silly and decides not to run
it since it's absurd.
