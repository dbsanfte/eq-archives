>>He means that since rangers tend to get aggro and keep it, and yet
 have lower AC and HP than the sponges, they can really drag on
 the healers' mana resources.<<

Ah, that makes sense. I've never played a ranger, and I'm normally nominated
to do the pulling, so not much experience just waiting for mobs to roll in.

(invited into group.
 Me: so, whos the main assist?
GL: you)


 >>>SNIP<<<

 >>(Hmm, wait, I think you and I have different mental pictures.
 Here's what I see: ranger and sponge both toe to toe with the same
 mob, mob turns [naturally] to deal with the person hitting him the most
 often and doing the most damage.  That person stops swinging, the sponge
 keeps it up, while insulting the mob's lineage, begging from it, sitting
down
 between blows and quietly sobbing about how terrible his damage is and
 how quickly his friend is dying... until maybe the mob decides to give the
 nice sponge a little attention just so he doesn't get weepy)<<

Am I detecting sarcasm? I am, aren't I?

If the ranger is not the puller, then he should not get agroed often unless
he's standing in the wrong spot. Then again, this is just from my
experience. Now I can see that happening if a train comes in, and I
occasionally train greens just to clear out the area. (I'd rather take on 3
greens, short rest, then the blues ... instead of 3 greens AND the blue)

>> Noone mentioned a ranger's biggest job, Snare<<

Rangers can snare? Man, I need to group with Rangers more often.

>>>SNIP<<<

>> Another good person to make that call is the cleric; he generally has a
better idea of
 the pace the group can handle than anyone, and often its his mana that
 is the limiting factor for pull rate.<<

True, since the Cleric is also usually in the back observing everything,
while I'm usually observing a mobs belly button.

>> OOM is a dirty word, nooone should be saying it unless things just
 went very badly.  Generally in a steady pull situation, everyone should
 be floating between FM and 60M at fights end each time, that way you
 always have the capability to handle an overpull or take care of business
 if you get trained.  You see OOM in camps, where there is going to be
 an enforced wait till the next spawn, so casters can afford to burn heavy
 since the group won't be forced to wait on them to med.<<

We were doing orcs in HH, so once we trained (I don't think you can pull
just one out of thier, they seem to spawn in groups) we had a little time
for casters to med. Plus it didn't help that after the chanter mezzed all
but one mob, the wizzie started AoEs.

>>>SNIP<<<

Again, every group will be different, but hopefully you've gotten some bare
bones facts to help you in your grouping ventures.
