I overheard some people in the bazaar the other day confirming that
this was the cause. They also mentioned a fix, that I cannot confirm
works, but, someone stated that if you delete your bazaar files and
repatch, it fixes this. Havent done this myself or actually had this
happen to me so I cannot say if this really fixes it or not.
