This has come up on my server, the wyverns in cobalt scar are a very 
popular prey. They have about a 15 minute spawn timer. Being a cleric, I 
can root and nuke 3 before I have to stop and med. Druids and certain 
others can happily kite around groups of 4 in the time it can take me to 
do 2 and go on to the next batch until they clear the entire plateau and 
I have managed to get all of 4 or 5 done.

All I ask the zone for is the wyvern tower and the end wyvern [as long 
as it isnt Yvolcarn] and in general they are polite enough to leave them 
for me. Polite sharing. In return, they can get heals, temperence or 
blessing of faith and the occasional rez when things go south. At lower 
levels, in Paludal I have shared the corridor with the 3 shrooms and bug 
with people just fine, adding in pulling the phlargs from the cave at 
teh end of that corridor by discussing it with the people. [though i 
admit that being unemployed, I am frequently the first person there, and 
they are asking me to share=)]
