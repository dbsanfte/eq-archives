I have personally seen script material provided to EverQuest 2 GMs which 
specifically reference things called "Event Scrolls", which are designed to 
spawn mobs of varying sizes. These scripts call for the GMs to look for 
groups of adventurers in a certain level range, interact with them and then 
spawn "appropriate" mobs using the Event Scroll. This suggests not only that 
mob spawning may be posisble on a case-by-case basis, it also suggests that 
it's probably not something that is in the ordinary package of powers given 
to GMs.

I didn't ask for this material -- some well-connected individual provided it 
to me unsolicited -- but it was a pretty interesting peek at some insider 
activity. The scripts referred to Guides, Apprentice Guides and Guide+'s, 
each with differing degrees of authority over events. /shrug
