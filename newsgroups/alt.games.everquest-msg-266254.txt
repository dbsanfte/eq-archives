   Lenny suggested something similar.  My problem is that food poisoning
can range from fairly mild to outright deadly, and there's little one can
do to control the process.  I've made the decision that poisoning,
regardless of how it is achieved, is simply out.  My employer won't put in
a camera system to catch them/me, but homicide department just might dust
for prints.  Besides, I've got some sense of propriety here.  Making
someone seriously ill, or even killing them, is not a goal here.
