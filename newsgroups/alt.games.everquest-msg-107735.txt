It's true. I hate groups in which the only conversation is "pull. inc.
pull. inc." However, my constant twisting prevents me from fully
interacting in a group much of the time. I'll often just tell a group
when I join that if I don't answer right away to something, it's
because I'm busy doing things they can't see rather than because I'm
feeling anti-social. If I'm in a "safe" battle then I'll sometimes
skip a twist in order to get a comment in, but if it's a choice
between chatting and keeping the group supported, chatting loses out.
I do my chatting during downtime when I've got clarity song on
full-time. *heh*
