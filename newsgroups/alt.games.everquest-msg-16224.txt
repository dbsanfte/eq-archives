6. We may terminate this Agreement (including your Software license and
your Account) immediately(1) and without notice(1) if you breach this
Agreement or repeatedly infringe any third party intellectual property
rights, or if we are unable to verify or authenticate any information
you provide to us, or upon gameplay, chat or any player activity
whatsoever(2) which is, in our sole discretion(2), inappropriate(2)
and/or in violation of the spirit of the Game(2) as set forth in the
player rules of conduct, which are posted at www.everquest.com.

Note the areas marked (1), they pertain to VI's right to take action
immediately if they feel it is warranted, no prior offenses or warnings
required.  Now note the areas marked (2), they pertain to VI's right to
decide what they consider an offense.  Quite simply, they acted well
within their rights.  If you are seriously offended by their actions I
suggest you play another game, if you just wanted to stamp your feet,
well done.
