	Aye.  Pet classes IMHO have no excuse; if you're high enough lvl to
	solo HGs, your pet is likely strong enough to quickly solo all PHs
	except cyclops.  I'm constantly doing drive-bys on PHs with my pet. 
	My pet solos the cyclops too, but does take a nuke or heal.

	Considering the *extreme* disproportion of HGs that druids of a
	given level can and do take on they should legitimately be killing
	more PHs then anyone else, reguardless how "inconvenient" it is
	without a pet.

		Tracking: Find the new HG pops first.

		FoW: Get to the new HG pops first.

		Cheap mana snare: Drag new HG to their Rot Farm and threaten
		to /petition anyone that thinks a walking HG showing no dmg
		and a druid so far away /assist has no chance of working
		might actually be available to kill.

	Some classes are better at farming HGs then others; I'm fine with
	that.  The fact however, that at least on EMarr the farming druids
	also constantly bitch about KSing when A) they take far more HGs
	then any other class, B) don't kill PHs, C) "snare and run" such
	that it's nearly impossible to know if someone has the HG or if it's
	just wondering. -Personally I test fire a lvl 1 nuke, but really the
	druids need to stay with their damn mob, cause it to run (no snare),
	or do dmg.

	Fuck druids. :-P

: I don't see a 2.5 hour base duration regen buff in that list.

	True, but then casters can't bandage mana (well, actually non-Iksar
	necros can, indirectly).

	There are also regen potions.  AFAIK there are no crack potions. 
	I'd say the fact that all regen potions I know of suck ass and cost
	far, far too much is a bug, not a feature.

	I basically look at it this way; I think once a battle is finished,
	reguardless how close, there isn't any good game play reason for
	down time, solo or group.  What's the point in having 2k HP or 2K
	mana if you're forced to only use a tiny percent of it durring any
	given fight, or risk huge amounts of down time?  This goes for melee
	or caster alike.

	Down time is stupid.  If the fight is over and you're not dead, you
	should be able to get your HP and mana back in seconds, not tens of
	minutes.
