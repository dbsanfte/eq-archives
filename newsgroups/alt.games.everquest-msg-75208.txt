Capture that Flag (as we used to call it) is a game that consists of
2 teams (can be more but we always had 2).  Each team take a flag
and goes to what they hope is a well hidden location to plant there
flag.  The object is to find your opponents flag, take it back to
your home base (your flag).  This is a bit simplified, but will have
to do.

I used to love playing that game in the woods by my home town
(really they were IN my home town, hehe).  Had an old graveyard as
part of our field as well since the woods sort of went around it.
Perfect.  Naturally we played at night and almost always had 30 or
more of us out there getting crazy with our imaginations running
wild.

All that said, I can't seem to find time away from EQ to even try
DAOC.
