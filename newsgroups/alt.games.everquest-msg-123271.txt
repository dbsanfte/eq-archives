These items have always been available from all standard potion
vendors (the same guys that sell the invis potions) and retail off
most of them, assuming you have 105+ cha and good faction,
for 6pp.  The potion vendor in Shar Val seems to want a markup,
though, with good faction and 105 cha he still charged me
8pp.

They also drop off the first key guy in Befallen, which I used to
(and many still do) think was the only source for them  Everyone
should have one in the bank and another on their person, invaluable
in finding your own deeply lost body, and perhaps even handier
that of your buddy (the buddy system saves a long walk to the
bank from your bind spot and then back to your zone of death)...
well everyone but necros, bards and perhaps SK (I forget)
