Hmm. Maybe some information on the origin of the word "plonk" would help me 
to better understand the distinction you're making here. I've always 
thought that to plonk someone was to inform them that you were killfiling 
them. Why would one plonk and not follow it up with a killfiling? If they 
wouldn't, then can't one reasonably assume that if you plonk someone, 
you're also killfiling them, and therefore use the two terms 
interchangeably?

Or, are we splitting hairs here?
