If you're having a joke at my expense, haha.

If you're serious, please explain to what it is you're trying to
get at here.  Are you suggesting that players should go out of
their way to train themselves by pulling mobs across each other?
The "pop right out" deal with the Chief/Elites is caused by their
compensating for inadequacies of mob AI and pathing by having the
mob warp on top of you if it gets hung up on terrain for too long.
The other mobs that would chain agro on you are already there next
to the pull target and will chain on a puller who is not high
enough to get singles, the L61 who suggested this technique gets a
single pull because of level (somebody else said 55 is sufficient
to single-pull these mobs).  IIRC, you're highest level char is
mid-40s, so you may not have seen yet how level is crucial to
single-pulling.  The frenzy radius of a mob is affected by the
level of the character his buddy is agro'd on, the higher you
are the closer mobs have to be to one another before they'll
chain agro on you (this also applies to them agro'ing on you due
to proximity, the higher you are the closer you have to be).  It
becomes a lot more obvious an effect as you level into the 50s and
start finding it much easier to single pull some mobs.  Example,
at level 51 I could reliably single-pull even from tight groups in
LGuk, as long as none of the mobs I didn't want to pull was a Dar,
Bok, or named.  But all of those lower blue and green con mobs that
wouldn't chain on me would cheerfully jump all over me if I got too
close.  So the trick is to be high enough level and pull from range,
or if you can't get singles that way you have to use Lull/Harmony or
FD or some other trick to split the pull.
