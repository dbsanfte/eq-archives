Hmmm, sounds like the wheel fell off the "WOW is the best MMORPG ever
and everything else sucks" bandwagon.  Mind you, in my opinion, any
new MMORPG will have it's fair share of disasters when setting out, so
really, have a sense of proportion, guys.

I mean, after a few years of playing MMORPGS, you just have to take
the rough with the smooth - servers being down, patching the patch of
the last patch, that sort of thing.  Heck, maybe I'm just rational  ;)
