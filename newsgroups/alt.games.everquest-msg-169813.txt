Yeah, it seems to be utterly unpredictable and vary every third patch or 
so.  I've usually just gone with using one type of invis period and 
assuming it will hose me if I try to stack any of invis, improved invis, 
foliage shield, gather shadows, hide/sneak, etc without clicking off the 
previous method.

}indif to the gypsies 

Yeap.  Experience has led me to believe that the instant you see that 
message, there's about 15% odds it's gone haywire and you better (a) hope 
you didn't need invis right -now-, and (b) click it all off and start 
over.

I think there's a lot of merchants across Norrath who have some weird bias 
against rogues.  Go figure. :)

}However, when I had invis on and tried to hide, I got the "failed to
}hide yourself" message (which may just be random bad luck. My Hide skill
}is only 75), I still had the invis icon, but I was clearly visible. I
}had to click the icon off and re-hide to get invis again.

Yeah, that sounds like a perfect example of it. :)
