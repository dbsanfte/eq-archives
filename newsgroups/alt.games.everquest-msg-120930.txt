Wow, I hope we can get some confirmation on this soon. (I can see if I
have the right gear to test this tonight.) There's a lot of folks on
Graffes saying differently than you. i.e. the level III items won't work
on spells of level 44 and below.

I probably wasn't paying close enough attention last night, but my
Bracelet of woven grass (effect of Spell Haste I) was firing at least
every other time I cast gate. But I never saw it fire when I cast my
IC/GD port gate spells, or my group ports when I was giving rides to
friends. Must experiment more.
