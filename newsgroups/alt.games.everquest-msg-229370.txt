Taunt worked, on average, One time in three before.  90% reliable?  Wow. 
  Had no idea it ever worked that often, on mobs of any description.

Now that you get a message telling you when it works and when it 
doesn't, you are more aware of how rarely it does, and you can add some 
interesting insight if it is as dependant on the level of the target as 
it seems... but you'll want to do some rigorous experimenting and log 
file parsing to back this observation up.

Its possible that they did monkey with warrior, paladin and SK taunt 
such that it functions differently for the three classes, in fact its 
possible as far as I know that it always did function differently for 
the three classes; since we didn't have a really good way of verifying 
success rate before, only warriors really had any good numbers done on 
taunt.

This is because paladins and SK don't really need the taunt skill at 
all, they get their amazing aggro aquisition and holding capabilities 
mainly from spell casting... taunt working one time in three and getting 
you to highest level plus one point of hate, whereas stun or snare give 
huge aggro, often boosting you dozens of points over your competition, 
and working every time.  Taunt is nice if someone really shoots up the 
ladder past you, as it puts you back on top where your real aggro 
producers then boost you well over it again... but its not mission 
critical the way warrior taunt was.

Warriors now have some abilities that add taunt directly and reliably, 
it seems (a DOT type thing?) but I haven't seen any real discussion of 
how thats working out.

Splendid
