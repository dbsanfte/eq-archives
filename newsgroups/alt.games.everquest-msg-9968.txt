I have recently started two new characters, a
halfling rogue (now bound in Freeport) and a human
monk (still in Qeynos.)

Jumjumm (the rogue) just got pick lock and has a
set of lockpicks. Is there any place OTHER than
Befallen where he can practice? I don't much
relish the idea of sitting on the railroad tracks,
putting myself at risk (not to mention getting
others killed because I'm blocking their the only
escape path.) I've also been practicing my pick
pocket (got a "during combat" macro set up and it
works great.) At what point will I be able to
steal from non-humanoid, non-living critters? I've
heard others mentioning stealing the skin right of
a lion, but right now I've only had success (and
level increases regardless of success) from
goblins and orc with nothing from snakes, bats,
cats, zombies and skeletons.

Witte (the monk) is doing nicely, but has not had
a chance to practice safe fall. I assume that it
is just a matter of throwing myself from high
places? I've heard that you can do it from the
walk above the main Qeynos gate, but can't find
the way up there. There is the walk around the
arena, but dropping in like that to the PvP area
seems... well, stupid.
