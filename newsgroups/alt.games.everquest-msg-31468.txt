And that has exactly what to do with the "no oral sex" part? That
part, in itself, doesn't specify in public... so, the intent is not to
deter public indecency.

The rules are made for PCs, not NPCs. The people in charge of creating
the rules are not subject to those same rules.

....and how exactly did the EULA come in? Pulling stuff out of your
ass that's just completely ludicrous here. Really, that's low even for
you.

You've already seen it. In this thread. From the anti-petitioning
crowd. Or do lemmings not hear each other too well?

Something else I'd like to point out: I said it was every member of a
community's PLACE [....]. Not "duty", not "obligation", PLACE. Do I
need to spell out the difference?
