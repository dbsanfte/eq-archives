Considering all the different interpretations and variations that Word
has, it would seem that the concept of 'ultimate authority' is pretty
much meaningless in actual Christian application.

For example, Christians were quite happy to ignore the sixth and ninth
commandments under the guise of obeying Exodus 22:18 instead when it
served their purposes.

When you present a pet "sound bite philosophy" no one but you is
responsible for the fact that you don't like how other people react to
it.

Yeah, it loses that attractive edginess that comes from being released
of all responsibility to even attempt to treat others well.
