Yes, when I do have items to sell (which is rare), I use
a consignment shop near my home.  That way, I'm not bothered
with any phone calls, or anyone stopping by my house to see
the items, or haggling.

Ebay is probably the most successful cyber consignment shop
of all time.  Perhaps you've heard of it.  :)  And they even
let you keep your items listed when you're off-line!  Can
you imagine?!  :)

Hey, don't get me wrong, I like the bazaar.  It just seems
like yet another advantage going to lucky broadband customers
(like me).
