But in a 9 man group you could take on 3 even cons at the same time, who
ever said that the game had to be played traditionally like you always
played it taking "1 mob at a time"? Most of you guys seem so conservative
that i bet none of you would ever get a job as a designer for absolutely
anything on this planet. You guys are mostly consumers and it shows all too
well.

In fantasy books, how many times does the puller (?) pull 1 single mob to
the adventuring party? -none-
Usually its a gang of heroes vs. a gang of evil monsters. Perhaps this is
what SOE is trying to design. Sit in a dark room for 14 days and see what
you think, it might make you a more flashy person that can actually pull
chicks as easily you do mobs in EQ.
