I'm looking for a dead cheap, useless (to melee) book item that I can equip
in my avatar's hand.  I've heard of a couple that run for about 1k, but I
just want it for an 'in-town / EC' look.  As a rogue, and doin' alright for
my level, I get inspected *constantly*.  I prefer to leave my inspection
notice on (yes, I'm aware of it).

Presently, when in EC, I keep my Mask of Deception off so that I show as a
HEF and my Ry'Gorr mail looks more non-descript; I remove my helm, too.  I
have a CHA doll that I picked up off a Ferrott lizard so that it shows up as
an offhand totem.  And, recently, picked up a Glowing Torch while running a
test quest for my guild (long story).  So, all in all, I look like your run
of the mill druid.  *IF* I can find one, I'd like to replace the torch with
a book.

Suggestions?
