Compared to pretty much anything, really.

There are companies that release good hint guides
consistently. Prima is not one of them. The last few
Prima guides I've bought have been occupied in equal
parts by the stunningly obvious and rehashes of material
from the manual, with a maximum of perhaps half a page
of genuinely useful material.

With regards to Run Speed... a permanent SoW is
nothing to sneeze at.
