The situation you constructed is completely contrived.  Yes, you should make
an effort to max out your defensive skills, those might make the difference
in any number of fights, but there are no fights that are so close that
druid melee, of all things, is going to change the outcome.   If you want to
work on your melee skills and max them out,  then you should definitely do
so, as long as you're having fun.  But lets stop kidding ourselves.

Hitting and missing has no effect on weapon proc rate.

Hell, my rogue once had a weapon proc when she didn't even swing the weapon,
much less hit with it.
