 Good customer service?

 Verant patches the game, then tech support goes home at 5pm. Think about
it.
 Most ALL other gaming servers on the net offer 24 hour tech support. Also,
they usually beta a patch on a test server instead of doing a "Real Time"
release to all active servers.(MSNZone,VR1, and even DAOC)

 And as far as the Two GMs answering questions? Dude, I have not seen ONE
single GM that can answer any "Technical" questions as of yet. Check out the
Chat server once and you will soon find out its nothing more then a
playground and the GMs are holding conversations based on Music preferences,
T.V. Shows, and avoidance of any EQ based questions from players.
 Maybe I have only been on EQ a year, but the whole "Customer Service"
aspect you speak of simply doesn't exist in EQ.
