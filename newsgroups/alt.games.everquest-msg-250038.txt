Lake of ill omen is ok, mine soloed there. I think you can also solo
in the overthere up to about 23, then it will be all green or red so
move on to lake of ill omen.

Or you can go to luclin newb plus areas. Kos is not really an issue
for an SK, especially a troll. You are just GOING to be KOS in most
regular places, while you are totally non kos in the overthere or with
the Vah shir kitty people as well as the beginning luclin shadowhaven
zones and such.

Since everyone now gets the plane of knowledge, KOS is moot.
