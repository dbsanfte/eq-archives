Yep, that's about it.  Continue to bash mobs repeatedly and learn to
love it.  If you enjoy questing this isn't your game.  I thought EQ
was the best game out there until i tried others.  If you enjoy the
hack-n-slash, keep on going.  EQ is a great game, it's just not
designed as well as some of the newer ones in my opinion.
