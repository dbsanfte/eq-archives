Everquest is one of the first massive online games to make it to the 
main stream.  The interface and game mechanics shouldn't be challenging. 
  The things they've made easier help people learn how to play and have 
fun.  I started playing over three years ago on Quellious when no one 
could bind, port, or res.  I am glad I learned how I learned, but I am 
also glad that people can start now and not have to go through all the 
pain I went through.  It wasn't all necessary.

The game itself should be challenging.  Finding, pulling, and beating on 
an orc without getting an add on you should be challenging.  Battling 
your way through the lost dungeons should be challenging.  Hitting that 
"sense heading" hotkey five thousand times doesn't make the game more fun.

Mike
