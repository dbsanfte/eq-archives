   I read a couple of those "reviews".  They weren't reviews.  They were
either fanbois raving or disgruntled ex-EQlive players bitching about SOE
in general.

  That was pretty much my take.  The reviews have actually turned into a
weird sort of forum for people to discuss their opinions.  Too bad, it's
going to make it hard to sift through them when the real reviews start
being written after the game is actually released.

    That's certainly a possibility.  But then again, maybe not.  From what
I've heard from the playerbase, SWG was a flop.  But it is still selling
(for now), and therefore SOE considers it to be a success (for now).  And I
think that barring massive technical glitches, it will have a big launch. 
EQII have generated even more buzz than SWG did it seems to me, and it does
have that Everquest name to help it out.

   To be honest, while I certainly am interested in the launch, I am more
interested in what will be going with the game at its one year anniversary.
