I used to bitch and curse about the downtime in EQ. It seemed to me to be
blatently stupid and simply an excuse to make players hang around longer
and reduce the rate at which they could 'achieve'.

I spent 2 months in DAoC playing a Hibernian Bard. My reason for choosing
this was because, I had guessed that, since I would be playing off-peak
hours normally, a good group buffer/regen specialist would be well and
truely sort after at all times. I love to do everything in groups. Solo is
soooo boring.
Boy was I wrong. While a Bard is nice to have in a group in DAoC, players
innate regen makes Bards far less valuable than I had thought they would be.
Combine that with the whole other slew of problems people seemed to think
Hibernia had and the total over powering dominance of Midguard, left me
feeling pretty unhappy as a whole with DAoC.
I tried other classes and realms for a few weeks but I was pretty
disillusioned with the whole thing. Lack of content, no high-end encounters
to look forward to that sort of thing.
At the moment I think DAoCs weakness is its lack of content but that will be
solved with time. Hell EQ has almost 3 years over it. But I digress.

I think the downtime in EQ is only a PITA when you solo or have a badly
balanced group. SOE/VI have always said EQ is a social game and they
encourage grouping as much as possible. This I think is why EQs downtime is
pretty hefty. It forces people to group. I dont hate the downtime in EQ as
much as I used to.
Lotsa friends to talk to makes it pass quicker as well.

Dont mention Gems. Brad, how the hell did Gems ever get thought of? Sheesh,
you could have at least licensed the Tetris music so it could be played
while a PC played Gems. It was gimpy.

/em wanders off looking for his tetris music remix tape.
