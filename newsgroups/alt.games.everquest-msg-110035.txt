Even if you don't want the XP (or can't use it...CB belts aren't very good 
XP after level 8 or so), you can generally sell them for about 1pp/ea to 
other players who do.  It may take a couple days of tapping a "WTS" hotkey, 
but eventually someone will come and buy out your whole stock.  Nice way to 
save towards your first set of armor.
