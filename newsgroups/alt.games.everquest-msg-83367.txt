    Well, you may have done something "by accident" to lower Deeppockets
faction. But lucky for you, there's an easy way to raise it.

    Go into the Inn in town, and climb all the way to the top. That Inn is
also the Rogue's guild for the halflings, the rogues being the Deeppockets.
At the top of the inn are two NPCs. Ask one of them (can't remember which, I
think it's the non-vendor on the right) "Who is Stanos?" He'll give you a
little blurb about Stanos, and ask you if you want to help him. Using his
phrasing say that you'll help him (again, I apologize for not having the
exact phrase). Just saying that you'll help him raises Deeppockets faction.
So keep saying it until they all want to have your baby.

    And good luck with the Axe!
