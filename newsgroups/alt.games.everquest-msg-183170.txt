think many here will argue with that.

However, at 50 plat a pop, KEI isn't cheap, and planar groups in particular
often have poor loot. Expecting people to finish a group at a financial
loss is a little unreasonable.

If the melees *expect* casters to turn up with KEI, the casters should
receive corresponding compensation in their loot share, just as it's
reasonable for a cleric to receive compensation for peridot expenses.
(And just as, if a warrior provides peridots for cleric buffs, *that*
should also be compensated.)

If the group doesn't think the extra DPS (or safety) is worth the extra
expense... maybe they should think twice about complaining when a caster
does not have KEI.

Any caster worth their salt can play without KEI. To some extent it *is*
a crutch. If you feel incapable of grouping without it, there's a problem,
and it's probably not with the group. Thst's not saying that it's not
useful; just that it's exceedingly rare for it to be essential.

        ...Ronny
