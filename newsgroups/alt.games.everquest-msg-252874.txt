The court wouldn't force someone to pay $1k in exchange for nothing.  Since
that was never postulated, it's irrelevant.  You were buying a worthless
pebble, described in the advertisement as a worthless pebble, offered at
$1k, and you agreed to it.  That is "something" rather than nothing.  Please
try and at least stay within viewing distance of the actual discussion. 
Thus, arguing that the worthless pebble wasn't worth $1k to *you*, after
accepting by actions that it was worth $1k to *you* by purchasing it, in
front of a judge will elicit snickers and a judgment in favor of the
worthless-pebble-seller.  Your only hope is a shrink expert witness to come
in and testify that you are mentally incompetent.

Exactly.  You *agreed* to pay $1k for a "worthless pebble".  You weren't
misled.  That was your choice.  Value is set by the buyer for the most part,
in all aspects of life.  Courts will seldom interfere.

Any first year law student has heard the peppercorn example and would laugh
in your face at your ludicrous example.

Don't quote the case if you don't read the case.  It just gets you beat
down...

"The consideration of one cent will not support the promise of Schnell. It
is true, that as a general proposition, inadequacy of consideration will
*not* vitiate an agreement. Baker v. Roberts, 14 Ind. 552. But this doctrine
does not apply to a mere exchange of sums of money, of coin, whose value is
exactly fixed, but to the exchange of something of, in itself, indeterminate
value, for money, or, perhaps, for some other thing of indeterminate value."

Schnell v. Nell, 17 Ind. 29, (Ind. 1861) (emphasis added).

Read that real carefully and try to understand why that was probably the
absolute worst case you could have possibly referenced to try and support
your argument.

We've seen, above, how that comes out.  Sure you want me to "debunk" you
anymore (I really prefer the term "beat down", adds spice)?  =P

Fully aware.  The basics of how contracts operate are, however, universal
among all U.S. contract law.  You should be happy I quote UCC instead of
some local statutes, as with the UCC you at least have a *chance* of arguing
that the *actual* value of the "worthless pebble" is relevant.  Most courts
would still rule against you, but hey, a chance is better than no chance.

You have been beat down with your own case citation.  You have exhibited an
extreme lack of comprehension of the "legalese" of legal texts.  Sorry, but
this dance is over.  =P
