Well UBI screwed the shipping aspects of SOL up through out the world and
some retail places got it yesterday, but Best Buys chain only got it to some
of the stores drop shipped. Software ect in my town, 1 had it the other
didnt as of this morning!

Go figures, seem Verant needs to do an emergency patch even for shipping !
