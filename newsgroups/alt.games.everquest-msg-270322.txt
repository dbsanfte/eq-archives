Read the fine print at the bottom though. If the lag associated with the
new free subscribers interferes with the paying community they can, at any
time, revoke the free period. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, they're in

paying customers is just bad business. I'm just pointing it out now incase
they *do* have to cancel it at some point.
