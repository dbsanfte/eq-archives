Hehe, think again. The trade skills only become profitable with a
*huge* investment of time and plat. If you go into the trade skills
expecting to make money, you'll invariably be disappointed. However,
if you go into them just to have fun, then you'll have fun.

Should someone want a compass (unlikely because of the Sense Heading
skill), they will likely have already bought one from a merchant. And
I can only recall one instance where I saw someone selling a
telescope, which indicates they're not too popular either.
