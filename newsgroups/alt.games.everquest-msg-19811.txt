I usually cast SoW on anything I see running from something else :)  
Although the other day I saw a level 4 running from a coyote, and while I 
stood there stunned at a level 4 not being able to handle a coyote... I 
saw a madman go by :)  I knew I'd never be able to catch up, and she was 
good and far away from the madman anyway, so I rooted him.  Then I sent 
her a tell. "I rooted the madman. Want him?"  I got back: "NO!!!!!"  Oh 
well, I'll take him on, I'm uber now, they're all green to me anyway.

...

I used 3 or 4 spirit strikes, got him down not TOO bad then moved in for 
the kill.  "You punch a madman for 1 pt damage."

Oh crap.

I completely FORGOT I was on a corpse run, was naked, and now out of 
mana.  

/con

"A madman scowls at you, ready to attack.  Looks pretty risky."

Oh double crap.

Thank GOD, I was able to back up, and had just enough mana to cast tained 
breath so that when root finally broke, he took off and I was able to 
(verrrrrrry slowly) finish him off from the back. :)
