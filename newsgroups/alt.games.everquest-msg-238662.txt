Alt+V will bring up the adventure window, click on the right button and you
will get a list of you points and their distrubution among adventures.

Adventure Merchants in each of the Wayfarer Camps.  You may spend your
points in any camp, but the maximum single item value purchase is capped by
how many points you have earned in that adventure.  For example, you have
earned 100 points in NRo and 500 points in EC.  You have a total of 600
unspent points.  You may purchase twelve 50 point items in NRo, or one 500
point item in EC, but not a 600 point item in EC.

> 4. Someone always gets the mission - who of?

The group leader gets an adventure from the Adventure Recruiter in each of
the wayfarer camps.

http://www.cardplace.com/eq/ldon/list.cgi

points - including item values, stats,  and camps in which they are sold
