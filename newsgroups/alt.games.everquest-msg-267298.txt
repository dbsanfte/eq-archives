Each person needs to run through the dialogue.  Also, at least one person
needs to attack the gnome and get himself killed, along with no less than two
bards (who were playing AE mana.)  ...  well, ok, maybe that part isn't
strictly speaking necessary, but think of it as upholding tradition.

To get inside the factory, you need at least one person that has the flag to
open the factory door.  This one person can hold the door open for the entire
raid though.   The factory flag is gained by escorting the gnome in PoI to his
confrontation with the clockwork dragon.   (Don't ask me to spell the name...
something close to Xananamech.)

Those who don't have the factory flag are not required to get it ever.
Although it does mean that if/when they get down to Plane of Time key
combinations, they will have to beg grumpy dwarven warriors to come to PoI and
fight to the factory to let them in the door.
