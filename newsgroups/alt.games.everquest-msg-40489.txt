 DMF is good. It's worth at least a point.

 People need to not look at the four fights and say that's the Monk
epic. While those fights are fairly easy overall, completing the Robe of
the Lost Circle and Robe of the Whistling Fists are not a trivial task
and will take longer than a Saturday to complete. Although you can try
killing Qwinn or Zephyl for RotLC if they are still dropping it. Those
aren't exactly easy fights though.
