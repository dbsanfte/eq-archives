Soulfire has always been No Drop.

The existing problem with the Soulfire is that while no 
non-Paladin could ever actually wield it, its charges
of Complete Heal (instant-cast, nonetheless) could be
fired from inventory by any class.  So it was useless
as a sword to non-Paladins, but very useful as a
5-charge instant-CHeal item.

It's being changed so that only Paladins can use the
Complete Heal charges, although I don't know specifically
whether it's being done by making it necessary to equip
it before firing the CHeal, or by doing a class-check
when it's being right-clicked from inventory (or
wherever).
