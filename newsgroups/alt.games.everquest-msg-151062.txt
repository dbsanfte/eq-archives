Now, I'm at the level where I need advice on a hunting grounds.  What I'm ideally looking for is a spot that a puller can pull do, with a limited amount of adds.  A spot tailored to a tank, that has healers.  (Basically, I find it difficult to cast anything other than heals & buffs with the occasional DD/DoT thrown in).  Anyways, I suppose I should lay out the group setup...

Decent loot would be nice, but is not a priority.  Decent experience would be super, but again, that's not too important either (dark blues would be fine).  Outside zone would, of course, be preferred.

Tenebrous Mountains (Coterie camps) but didn't like it too much (because of adds - aliens and wolves always make things difficult at just the wrong time).  Rockhoppers never seem to be up when I check DSP, so have never done those.  Mons Letalis didn't work well for running three characters myself (but is nice when I find a 'real' group).  Maiden's Eye was a no-no running all three alone (seemed impossible to pull a single).

SW corner of Scarlet.  Park the casters on the rocks and pull to right
in front of them.
