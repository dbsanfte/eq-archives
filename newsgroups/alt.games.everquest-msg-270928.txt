3 months is exactly what it says. 3 months. Doesn't matter if you sign
on only one day during that period. Not sure what Canadian $
translates to in US $, so I can't really say if it sounds
reasonable... $23.33 per month...

It's generally cheaper to go with a credit card payment. Dunno if
Canadian banks have check cards, but here, at least, if your ATM card
has a Visa or Mastercard logo on it, you can use it as a credit card
to pay the fee, it just deducts straight from the bank rather than
from a line of credit.
