You can't claim camps in Everquest, much less camps you can't actually
be at. It sounds like you were in a good place to be in control of two
rooms, though.

Well no, but you did leave. It doesn't really matter why. If you are
trying to camp an area, which is unsupported in the first place, it is
silly to leave then still try to claim it. For all that guy knows you
just arrived.

Unless the guild was some lowbie guild, they'd laugh at you. As far as
leaving your kills alone, its good to just go to non newb areas.
Honestly I'm surprised you found other people in unrest at all. I
think its always empty when I've been there on the tribunal, as is
mistmore and such places. Sometimes its just bad luck getting kills
stolen, it happens much less at higher levels when things take longer
to kill. Then a guy has to do a lot more than hit something twice so
he is without excuse while you say 

"Umm no.. thats mine, yeah please stop okay? Ummm hello? Yeah, I'm
killing that thing, yeah that one, kay? Ok thanks, yeah have fun, no
no hard feelings, yeah say hi to the wife umkay? okay see ya, yeah
sure here is some sow, ummm ok buh bye.."
