Id like to see how someone as mature and clever like you handles it when
someone comes and steals your camp. Maybe (as you pointed out) youd start on
a more congenial tone. After that doesnt work what next? I guess since
reporting is too immature for you, youd just let them have the camp and
leave quietly? Or is there an option I missed?
You would get walked all over on our server with that attitude.
