Question: 
With religious diversity increasing, what are your thoughts on the
protection of religious freedom and the separation of church and
state? Should religions like Wicca be banned from recognition by the
military, as some legislators suggest?

Answer from George W. Bush:
Religious Freedom And Tolerance Is A Protected Right. I am committed
to the First Amendment principles of religious freedom, tolerance, and
diversity.

Whether Mormon, Methodist, Jewish, or Muslim, Americans should be able
to participate in their constitutional free exercise of religion. I do
not think witchcraft is a religion, and I do not think it is in any
way appropriate for the U.S. military to promote it.
