    My original character, troll SK, was soloing inside Upper Guk at 22 (I
don't count the low stuff right near zone). Go inside, go left at the fork,
cross the planks, and in the open room go out the exit with a plank leading
to a dirt floor. Set up shop in the corner, beside the plank. The three
frogs across from you are blue, and there's many other blue frogs nearby.
Depending on which way you pull from and how good a BST is at soloing, you
could pull the Squire PH, Realist PH, and Idealist PH to there. I doubt
you'll ever run out of frogs. There's one wanderer to worry about. Be sure
to have some way of stopping runners.

    As a troll, the OP wouldn't run into the faction campers. They AoE dead
frogs, and she wants to pillage and loot live frog homes.

    Personally, I don't like the live side. The corridors are too twisty,
even for me, and the spawn density is designed so pulls come in clumps.
There are rooms you can set up to pull, and zone in camping is possible, but
I don't see it as being very friendly to the soloist without snare.
