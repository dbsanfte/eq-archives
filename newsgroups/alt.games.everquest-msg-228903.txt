If you read his message, he's experienced two different problems.

The first is the normal "they are patching" nonsense where the game lies 
and claims to be having connection problems when its actually in mid 
patch.  I don't think he's got any complaint about that, just explaining 
that he did see it and it looked as it usually looks during a patch.

THEN he got this new problem, where the game connects, says the servers 
are up, but boom, he gets disconnected.  Repeatedly.  For hours.  So its 
not a fluke.

Its a new and different kind of messed up.

His question, and a valid one, is whether this is just some new kind of 
patch reaction that he's not seen previously, or whether he is somehow 
borked.

If there are lots of people logged on and happily playing, then he needs 
to look into fixing things on his end.  If nobody is getting in and 
everyone is getting this new weird message, then its something on SOE's 
end that will presumably get fixed in due order.

Splendid
