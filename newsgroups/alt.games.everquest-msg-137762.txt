that's very cool, i (and i'm sure others) had no idea . . . we'll come

i gotcha, i was just trying to refine the question . . .

rogues really can't make it too far, obviously

warriors can solo up to around 40 though, depending on gear and zone

soloing, to me, isn't "hey i can kill that mob by myself" - its "hey in 3
hours i can make more exp than your group!"

so for most classes, the latter statement is only made during a specific
level range


and that's just why i'm asking why *in general* there is thought to be a
class that can't solo, other than rogues (and i guessed it was clerics, but
hell, after that battle cleric post - anything can be possible)


for example, enchanters *could* root and nuke, but that's not going to hold
out well in the long run (time vs exp) . . . on the other hand, a mid-level
(i'd say 40ish is a safe bet) enchanter might notice that he can charm kite
one day, and make an easy run through exp for the rest of his career

paladins do NOT have the damage output to solo past 30ish, in my experience
. . . am i getting warmer? almost guessed it?
