I noticed something very important in your message. You took your own 
GROUP. Many of us don't have that luxury, so the only spot to find a 
group is really in PC (at least at the hours I play). Unfortunately for 
me, all my friends are level 65 and in the elemental planes, but I'm 
still having fun in zones I have never seen before with a new 
character/account.
