You'll do fine in Crystal Caverns, bind your Ranger in Thurgadin. If you
don't want to go there, then kill Snow Cougars in Ice Clad, also very good
exp. The Cougars are especially nice as you can go to the second isle and
stand at the first tree, pull a cougar and then panic animal, DoT and let
your Ranger friend beat on it as it runs, reapply fear as needed. Better
than Lake of Ill Manners incorporating Lake of Moron Doods
