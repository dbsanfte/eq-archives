Yeah. I'm just poking fun. I'm as guilty of it as the next guy. :)

To be sure.

But for that, you really just need to know RAM, CPU, and graphics card. 
Maybe motherboard. The rest is all pretty much fluff as far as EQ is 
concerned. *Anything* reasonable in terms of the rest of the parts as 
long as they aren't complete junk will perform much the same.

After all, there's a reason we don't see a lot of benchmarks rating 
Unreal Tournament framerates against various CPU heatsink adhesives.

In any case there is a limit to what is relevant, to what is useful, and 
to what is only required if you wanted to replicate his system down to 
the torque he used to tighten each die-cast steel fabricated screws with 
a Sears Craftman brand Philips driver, series 2B (made in 2001 and sold 
as part of the "Deluxe Driver Set" in the red box, part # 3324491.
