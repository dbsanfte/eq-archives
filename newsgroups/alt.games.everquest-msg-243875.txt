I ordered this product today.  LOL  I will get it sometime mid week.  Bought
another VCR to devote specifically to burning and am getting everything squared
away.  Keep my email handy, we'll keep in touch and I'll let you know if it is
worth the $280 I'm putting out for it.  Well, Ok, and the $60 for a new VCR,
and $14 for 5 DVD+R, and....  LOL

Anyway, hopefully by the end of next week, my daughter and my wedding will be
digitized!  =P

Thanks again everyone!
