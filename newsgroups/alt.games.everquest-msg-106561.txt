I was wondering if anyone had a look at the eqatlas.com review of the
edimensional 3d glasses.  you should.  i picked up a pair after
reading the review and i am truly blown away.  if you thought eq was
too addicting to begin with, these glasses truly bring the eq world to
life.  it's like you can reach out and touch things...very life-like. 
everyone should check them out. the 2d view didn't look so good at
first, but i learned how to tweak the settings so after a few minutes
you can get it looking much better.  if you have any questions, feel
free to email me at seetheflash00@yahoo.com.  i don't think I'll ever
take mine off and I am very pleased with the service and support I
got, so i'm happy to help anyone out who has questions.
