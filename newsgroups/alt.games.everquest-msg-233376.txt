(Heh, I snipped the post to somewhat change the thrust of it at this
point!)

Ah yes, the group  :D

While Enchanters can do superb crowd control duty, it also takes a
good group to take advantage of the Enchanter's crowd control efforts.
I have been in groups who cracked under pressure and just melee'd
anything in front of them.  They panic so much they never use an
'assist' button on the main tank and they ignore hotkeys like "I have
mezzed a <mobname> - you hit it you kill it."  I almost never use my
Enchanter with strangers because so few of them can work with an
Enchanter properly  ;)

Mind you, with a group of regular team-mates, and/or who know the
ropes, it can be a blast!
