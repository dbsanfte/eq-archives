After having EQ with only Kunark and Velious for so long, I picked up
the Platium set (EQ classic plus 7 expansions) and installed them in
the same directory as the original but when I run EQ, the server
screen only reports I have 2 expansion installed, not the 7 I just
got.

I could do a complete uninstall and then reinstall but I don't want to
lose the custom window setting, filters, colors, and such.  I hope
it's as simple as editing an ini file to point the expansion
correctly.
