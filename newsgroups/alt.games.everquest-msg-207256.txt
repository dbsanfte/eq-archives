Well, as someone who has got his Epic just yesterday, allow me to relate 
my experience while it's fresh.

1) Run around talking to NPCs.
2) Camp and kill some of the Corrupted mobs that a solo Druid can handle. 
Banter with the people camping Lord Bergurgle.
3) Go on a CoM "raid" with the guild. The quotes are there because five 
people doesn't fit my definition of "raid". Miss out on the only Jade 
Reaver that drops.
4) Bitch on /gu that I've missed out.
5) Only lvl 65 on the guild promises to help. To my amazement, he turns 
out to also have a monk in the local Uberguild. Tag along as the PoTime-
geared monk demolishes Reavers, Uulump, Fay, and assorted other epic 
mobs. Endure friendly jibes in a.g.e.
6) Tainted Seafury Cyclops refuses to spawn, despite multiple clearings. 
I thank Monk profusely and we call it a day.
7) Next day, on my own, try OOT again. Amazingly, tainted Seafury is up. 
Kill it... Buff up for Epic fight, my first with a summoning mob. Gasp 
at how much of a wuss the Corrupted turns out to be.
8) Head to Karnor's Castle. Track. VSR up. Tell guild to gather forces 
for a VSR raid. Hear crickets chirp. Track. VSR not up. ooc if the 
people who killed him would consider a MQ. Get a response, from a very 
nice fellow, it turns out. Scramble to vendorize all the stuff in my 
Bazaar mule. Scrape together 8k. Fellow accepts. Port to FV, do MQ. More 
turn-ins. Get Epic.

All in all, it was a chance to meet some very nice players, but while 
the quest itself is epic in scope, the implementation seems rather 
pedestrian. Like on most things, probably the only people to get the 
full effect of what an Epic quest was meant to be was probably the very 
first people to solve each quest. For the rest of us, it was only a 
checklist. This doesn't mean I'm not immensely grateful to all those 
players who helped me, of course...
