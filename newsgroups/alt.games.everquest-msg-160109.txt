 That's why life gets a little tougher for soloing Druids once they get
level 52. Since everything under that is blue (or green) you have no way
to know if the mob summons or not. 

 Mobs don't summon out of the blue though. So someone had to be fighting
him at the time if he summoned you. Summoning mobs only summon after
having taken some damage. If he was at 100% he would have just chased
after you and not summoned.
 
 If you don't like being forced to join a group I'd advise you not to
get above level 60 since once you get 61 about the only places you will
be able to solo, although there are exceptions, are Plane of Nightmare
and Plane of Disease.
