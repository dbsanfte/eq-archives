They do have a point though, the darkness line isn't a very mana
efficient spell for a necro, it might have a double resist check (I
think that was removed though), it doesn't break mez (and there's
definite advantages to snaring a mob before you breeak mez) and if you
don't need the long caster version there's still a 3+ minute snare for
30 mana. 

Really, the only advanatage of the darkness line is their huge agro, a
high end SK casting his best dark will mean a slower isn't gonna get
hit at the beginning of the fight.
