Also, keep in mind that there are 6 variations of fighter.  If you want a
character that dishes out more melee damage than a Guardian / Paladin / SK,
there is always the option to go Beserker / Monk / (evil monk).

If you've already chosen warrior, bezerker is still available.  You won't get
quite as heavy armor as a guardian, but you'll get all kinds of damage
attacks.

If you're interested in huge damage, then you might be happier as a scout or
mage archtype.  You'll lose a lot of survivability, but gain a bunch of
damage.
