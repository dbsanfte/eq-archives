I don't see much relation from the Doctrine and Covenants.  Also, not too
much in the Book of Mormon... I don't recall seeing anything in BSG that
reminds me of Alma, or King Noah.  No final battle of the magnitued of the
Nephites' last stand against the Lamanites.

What it does remind me of, though, is Church history.  The driving out from
New York, seeking a land to establish Zion.  The armada is nothing but a
stellar wagon train.
