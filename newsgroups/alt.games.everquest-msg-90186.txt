I've played all of these -- except Halfling rather than Human druid.

Agree 100% on the bard. I couldn't believe how well he soloed
with so little downtime. I went as far as level 22 with him
before going back to grouping with another character.

The druid is at a weak point in the teens. His offensive 
capability is still quite weak at this point. Unlike melees
trying to solo, the druid just gets better with age.

Ogre SK, so lovable, but all those HP and no way to heal
them other than wimpy little lifetaps...
