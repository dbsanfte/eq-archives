Before Velious (and particularly before Kunark) there used
to be a very clear upgrade path for all warriors. Now your
best upgrades depend heavily on what your guild is doing:

If you're in a very casual guild or no guild (no planes
raids), Royal Frosted Velium is the easiest, and it won't
hurt to hope for Cobalt drops while you exp in KC, but they
are pretty rare. You can also shoot for public Hate raids.

If you're in a basic Kunark guild, you might level a bit and
shoot for some Incarnadine from Chardok raids.

If you're in a Kunark dragon guild, you could level to 55
and go for Cobalt BP and Greaves.

If you're in a Velious Kael raiding guild, get that.

If you're in a PoG raiding guild, go PoG.

You get the idea.

As you get into mid 50s raiding, you may want some swappable
resistance also, such as: BD Gear or Diamond Rings.
