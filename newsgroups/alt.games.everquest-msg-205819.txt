If there was a way we would all do it, no one gets something for nothing or
no effort.

Best bet would be to farm DSP rockhoppers. Keep the LQ etc and turn them
into leather padding. Sell the padding and the Flawless, Superb etc hides
you get in bazaar while you sleep. Farming tradeskill components is a good
bazaar cash cow and most of it is off trivial mobs.
