Unfortunately, you're wrong - the changes are not restricted to test only.
Anyone who's using Verant's published (but "unsupported") server status
protocol (referenced at
http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/general/server_status_protocal.jsp
), see the "1 player" for *ALL* servers. The protocol doesn't seem to have
changed, it just now always returns "1" for that data field (with the
possible exception of "LOCKED" servers, which may still return "FFFF" -
haven't seen the data while a server's locked lately, so I don't know for
sure).

It's not just for the test server - the player counts for all of the servers
have been set to 1, making that information useless for anyone who is using
(or has written) an application implementing Verant's server status
protocol.
