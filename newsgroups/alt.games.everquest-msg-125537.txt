I two box a cleric with my monk.  I think the cleric was a good choice on
that because you can be brainless and hotkey the heals.  I don't know if I
could do that with another class (my friend two boxes a shamen and a rougue,
and it looks WAY to brain intensive for my personal taste), because of the
wider array of spells and group function they have.  My only advice is to
pick something with taunt because of adds and healing aggro.  It's hard to
get a pissed mob away from mine after an early CH, and even worse if she's
the first one on the hate list.
