Well, they're just started.  I assure you that within 30 seconds 
everything was dead.

> Why do they have a warrior (maybe to pull)

Yep, though to be more exact, they couldn't find a bard.  Because we were 
all tied up in the basement of KC by that warrior so he could get the easy 
exp.  AE pulling generally requires someone with enough HPs to survive 
aggroing 20-30 mobs.  Having a lot of HPs is useful, as is run speed 3, 
and the ability to aggro from a distance.  I personally use my AE 
slow/snare to pull for AE groups, though using the DoT version was a 
mistake.  :)

> Why do they have a Mage ( maybe that is all they could find)

It's a guild group.  That means fun is more important than maximum 
efficiency.  Though the level 59 Manastorm is really, really useful for AE 
exp groups.  Being able to do 2025 damage AND drain 150 mana from every 
mob is pretty damn nice.

The 3 Wizard group is more effecient.  However, the group that is there 
was more than powerful enough to keep a rather large area cleared.  Not 
every situation requires maximum effeciency.
