Why? It is very simple, my friend, and answered with a single word: Faction.
Faction with the local NPCs is useful, but faction with wandering players is far,
far better. True, many PCs seem to be on a "no faction list" (helping them does
nothing to improve your standing with them), but enough casters DO keep track of
such things that it is most definitely worth the effort.

My enchanter, Tvon, will generally cast breeze and serpent sight (a great spell
that gives infravision) any time his mana is not otherwise needed, just for that
reason, with preference to those casters who do charity work (he is particularly
attracted to "Free sow, heals and buffs at gate!") I hope that, some day, these
people will be there when I need a teleport or a rez or some buffs. And so far, it
has been paying off.
