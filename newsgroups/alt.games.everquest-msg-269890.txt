I'm not so sure why enchanters are regarded as hard to play/learn.
Agreed they are quite difficult in the levels up to 60. But then they
need gear as good as possible. Not only for mana regen - they have the
worst mana regen of all the int casters! - but for HP as well. Their
mezzes are costly so the role of train stoppers isn't going well without
quality gear and foci. Stuns are....well useless. There might be another
pb ae stun available now with a higher level cap though. But it's been
a while since I really played my chanter.

To sum it up chanters are buffers and slowers and mezz the occasional
add. Nothing to write home about. :/ If you want to have fun with an
enchanter I advise to start a new one too and adventure deep into
dungeons with a group. This is where I truly loved being an enchanter.
But since pop single pull groups I'd rather pick a shaman for a group
than a chanter. Though you could use charm in normal groups and play dps
class. But better have a snare class with you then...
