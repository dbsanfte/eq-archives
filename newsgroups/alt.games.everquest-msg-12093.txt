The only way you can move to another server is when they do a server split
and you can put yourself on the list to be moved (maybe) to the new server
to take some of the pressure off your current one.

I'm sure people have been moved to other servers but you'd have to find a GM
having a very good day and even then I doubt you'd have any success, unless
they're a personal friend of course hehe ... it's basically to stop people
with a bad rep on their current server moving to another and essentially
getting a clean sheet, it also stops high levels moving onto the odd brand
new server that appears and messing with the economy.
