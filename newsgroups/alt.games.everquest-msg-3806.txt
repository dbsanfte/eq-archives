	Oh, I realize that, but this is literally a black screen and
it shouldn't be like that.  I play on my bf's computer and can still
see just fine in the dark.  It's a little hazy, but it's not a black
screen.  We switched my monitor w/ his old computer's monitor and it
improved the brightness greatly.  Unfortunately, the monitor was old
and last night it gave out (we heard a pop and that was it).

	Oh yeah, I agree w/ you there.  That's something I'll just
slowly work my way into, once I've gotten a little more knowledgeable
w/ the game.

	*nod*  And I certainly fell to my death a few times, LOL.

	200MMX mHz, 64mb RAM, Win98, 4mb S3 Virge video card,
connection is DSL.  Lemme know if you need any other stats.  Can't
think of any off the top of my head at the moment.
