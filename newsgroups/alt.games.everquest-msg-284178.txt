Well, personally I wouldn't go that far - it's a way of doing it that
wouldn't appeal to me, but whatever floats their boat I suppose. 

Surely the members have more than one alt in their guild, so why the
imbalance in classes, I wonder?  On one server, for example, I have 8
different classes in the guild, so I'd have thought that the guild
members themselves would sort of "self-regulate" the ranks by making
alts in areas they feel they are lacking, if only to make it easier to
get a group with guildies.
