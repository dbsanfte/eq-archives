First, excuse me if some of the following facts and levels listed are
incorrect.  I am going on what I was told by the main assist so feel free to
correct me if i have some information wrong.

Saturday night I get a tell wondering if I would be interested in going on a
Kael raid.  I was standing in GD chatting with some high level friends who
had just finished the 10th ring quest so I decided to head over to Kael.  I
told the guild what I was up to and before I knew it, we had a full group
from my guild coming too.  The kael raid leader was kind enough to wait for
us to reach the staging area.   We meet about 25 other peeps and started
forming groups.  I was the only rogue there so I got put in the main assist
group with a 60 warlord.  The rest of the group included a 53 enchanter
(raidleader) 52 cleric, 51 shaman, and a 51 paladin.  Being my first raid in
Kael, I was understandably nervous but I figured a player has to do this
stuff to learn.   It was here that I finally learned we would be doing the
Riff cycles (?).

To sum that up, it is part of a ring quest and involves starting a chain
reaction of progressively harder giants to be killed in quick succession.
Lastly, the raid HAS to kill a coldain traitor before he runs away to get
the quest item.  If you manage to kill the coldain, the quest will reset
allowing the raid to begin again.

So, we started killing giants on the way to the Cycle area.   The light blue
giants would last for about 5 seconds with such a raiding force and I began
to feel a bit relieved and cocky.  Once we cleared the area where the Cycle
was to start, the Main Assist announced to the raid to get ready.   He than
started the cycle, pulling the first giant.   This one was easy and soon
fell.  It was a little freaky to see the next giant come running through the
far door that opened immediately upon the first giants death.  This one was
tougher than the first but was soon killed.   More and more, harder giants
came pouring into the room until we where facing a level 60, totally magic
resistant, giant.   This one was Tuff!  Killed our cleric almost immediately
and caused us to all start shouting in OOC "heal the MA!".  I was even
yelling in guild chat for our guilds participants to start healing the MA.
His health hovered around 1-2 bubbles for the next 2 minutes as he took most
of the damage and as all sorts of heals landed his way.  What fun.  I got
pelted a few times for around 150-200 but managed to evade most agro while
backstabbing away.
Eventually, the level 60 giant fell and spawned the traitor coldain.  I got
to him first and attacked, trying to keep him from running.   He hit hard
too, but soon the rest managed to draw agro and we managed to kill the quest
dwarf.

We congratulated each other, rezed our fallen, rolled for the drops and
prepared for another cycle.  Soon the main assist was fighting the first
giant in the cycle and we were into it again.   We got to the 4th or 5th
giant when the room started SPAWNING the normal giants!  Our enchanters
saved the day and started mezzing and charming the room spawns.  We managed
to live, kill the level 60 giant, and spawn the traitor coldain.  Sadly the
coldain managed to escape as most of us where still fighting room spawns.
This ended our raid as the cant be started again for 8 hours or so I was
told.  There where shouts of "why didn't you clear the room again before you
started the cycle?".  I ask my group (including the main assist and the raid
leader) if we started it too early, but I never got a reply.  We all started
to port out and the raid was over.

So, what was the answer?   Does the cycles restart on their own or did the
main assist start them too fast? Is it common to finish a cycle, med, clear
the room spawns, and the start the next cycle?

Thanks in advance for your answers or comments.
