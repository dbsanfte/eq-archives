I've read the Clavicula Salomonis, and the Occult Philosophy of
Agrippa, too. So I'm moderately familiar with the material.

Sure. He was a founder of one particular Wiccan tradition. Gardnerian
Wicca is just one of countless traditions, however.

Wicca is a religion - the Qabalah is a system of ceremonial magic.

Wicca draws on *many* sources for its rituals, pretty much entirely at
the whim of the individual practitioner or coven. While the Qabalah is
certainly a source of material for rituals in some Wiccan traditions,
it's by no means a corner stone, foundation, or necessary component of
any of them. Nor is it a contributor to the belief systems of Wicca -
modern Wicca traces its roots to countless pagan earth-based religions
and the traditions of witchcraft, not to Judaeo-Christian ceremonial
magic.

The Tetragrammaton is important in the Qabalah - it's utterly
meaningless to the Wiccan religion.
