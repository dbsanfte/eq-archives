In that situation, you would probably have a good case of negligence
on your hands. Any competant security system would have allready been
structured and compartmentalized to prevent such a situation. There is
no reason why a single employee regardless of level would have such
access. At the same time, any type of competant backup system should
be able to return characters to within a day of when the system died.
If Verant has neither, you shouldn't be playing EQ.
