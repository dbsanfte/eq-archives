Bod asked, "> Have you raided Onyxia? Are there any other high-level dragons 
or other
> suitable targets to raid in your game?"

Yeah, there is of course all the raids and instances that folk are doing 
over and over again to get their epic gear. I just don't have the time or 
the patience to do those aspects of the game. Take a good hour or two just 
forming a raiding party or Instance group...put everything else into the mix 
and 4 or 5 hours later you might get to "roll" on one piece of equipment 
that you might need.
WoW was very solo and casual pre-60..but at 60 the bottom falls out of that 
and you are left with either re-rolling another toon or doing the instance 
run over and over again.

I actually got more mileage from CoH which by nearly everyone's opinion was 
a very short-run game because of the "boredom" factor.

Oh well, DAoC still remains the MMORPG that brought me the most fun over a 
longer period of time...until ToA that is.
