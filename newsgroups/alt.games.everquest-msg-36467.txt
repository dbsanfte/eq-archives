> When do -you- know it's time to zone?

Some of these stories I've told before...

I know it is time to zone (or just generally RUN away) when:

The Half-Elven maiden says to you, "I'm not a slut! I just want to marry
SOMEONE (read "anyone") in-game."

The Ranger in your group is on the Enchanter in your group's /ignore list.

The bard says "I'll pull."

Multiple members of the group say, "Wizard!  Why aren't you up here
meleeing?!  Get off your ass and help tank!"

The Ranger who you've been following through the zone disappers, doesn't
respond when you say "I lost you." Then he says "Hello?  You going to help
me?"

This is time to hit "Gate"
The phone rings (IRL) when you're on the stairs in SOL A... SOWed.  (BTW
Your body and equipment do not incinerate... you can recover it...
eventually.)
