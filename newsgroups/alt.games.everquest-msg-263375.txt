As someone who has played a healer for most of my career in MMOGs, I just 
wanted to mention a couple of points regarding some important game dynamics 
for healers in this game:

There is no mana -- everyone uses and needs Power. This has multiple 
benefits. You know how in EverQuest once the tanks are healed, everyone has 
to wait for the healers to med and you're constantly getting annoyed at 
tanks who rush off to battle while you're half full? Well in this game, 
tanks can't tank if they're low on Power, their combat abilities require the 
use of Power, the same Power that is used by casters to cast their spells. 
This means that at the end of every battle, everyone is medding to regain 
Power and we healers no longer have to remind the everyone to wait. ;-)

Another benefit of this system is that there aren't as many items dropped 
that are caster or melee specific. Sure, the swords and armor will be, but 
any of the bracelets, rings, necklaces, earrings, secondaries, ranged, etc. 
that drop will generate OOOOOHHHS and AHHHHHS when everyone sees the +15 to 
Power and +15 to HP stats.
