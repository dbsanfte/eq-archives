We were around long before the 19th century.  Look at the advancements up to
then.  Republican form of government, medicine, innate human rights as
recognized (-not- granted) by the Constitution, the abolition of slavery...
By that time, we had gotten to a pretty advanced stage as a society.  Now,
when you look at society after the 19th centurey, you see civilization
having to come to terms with the technology we develop.  We have the destroy
much of ourselves (contrary to popular belief, this does not extend to
destroying the earth, or even humanity, that's just the sci-fi talking), and
yet we refrain from using it; the fact that we did not use nuclear weapons
in the Gulf War, or in Afghanistan shows our restraint.  We started out
polluting the environment, yet the atmosphere is continuously improving, as
we have pulled together to do the work that needs to be done.  Each time,
society is advancing as new pressures are introduced.  I'd say we're not
doing too badly.  Perhaps you can say where you think we've slipped.
