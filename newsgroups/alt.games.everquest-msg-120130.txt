I tried remapping my keyboard, found it much more trouble than simply
glancing up from the keyboard to make sure the chat cursor is activated
before I hit any key other than enter.  The last time I forgot was when
I went to see NPC trainer after making L30 on Kaev, about 2 years ago.

As a side note, way back when I started playing, before I understood
the difference between agro and faction, I deleted my original character
(L4 Paladin) and made Kaev after being killed for attacking my NPC
guildleader by accident.

Kaev <-- not a touch typist
