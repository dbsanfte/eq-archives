Today was the first day I attended an EQ wedding and was also the first
wedding I, being a cleric, presided over as the wedding minister.  :-)  I
played straightman to the smartasses in attendance.  Went for the heart-felt
speech with little humorous add-ins.  Had lots of compliments for what I did
and requests that I do their upcoming weddings.  Great time.  Great
role-playing experience.

However, I only had and thus could only wear my battle gear to the wedding.
A mismatch collection of different colored armor that I felt didn't add to
the occasion.  So...

What is a rather stylish complete outfit that would make a minister look
sharp and appropriate for a wedding?  I'm thinking ideally something along
the lines of a complete black outfit with a white collar or a respectable
robe with a slash around the neck and both tails down the front that a male
Halfling cleric can wear.  Ideally, it would be something easy to hunt for
or cheap to have made.  I'm only a 31 lvl cleric so I don't have a ton of
money to blow.  Only interested in things that would show up on my body ...
thus no need to list rings or such non-visible items.  Ideally all items can
fit all in one backpack that I can could then store in the bank for when I
need them to perform a wedding and only thus take up one of my bank slots.

Also, I'd like to have one of those books that lays open in your hand and
possibly a nice bishop-like staff.  Would want the staff to be vertical to
the ground during the ceremony and not looking as if it is about at crack
the bride or groom on the head.  Or do you have a better suggestion for what
I have in my hands?  Where can I easy hunt for or cheaply buy those?  Again,
like something sharp and appropriate for a wedding minister.

Lastly, what would be a good wedding gift from me, as the wedding minister,
to the bride and groom.  This time I went for humor and gave the groom a can
of worms and the bride a fishing pole.  Would like it to be humorous and
something they could either use or wouldn't feel bad destroying or selling.
