I DJ for the fun of it now. Was just using it as an example that I do
actually have a social life unrelated to EQ to counter the OP's
suggestion. The London goth scene has shrunk majorly over the last
decade, and where there used to be clubs 6-7 days a week, now there's
only weekends and my regular weeknight. I could've made a decent living
out of it a few years ago when I was resident main DJ at the biggest 80s
night in London (thx $$$ for playing junk I already owned or could pick
up at junk sales dead cheap), earning around $10k a year for a once a
week 3 hour slot, and if I'd expanded upon that or actually devoted the
time to promoting my own night, it would've been easy to give up the day
job. Trouble is, banks don't like giving mortgages on 'transient' jobs
like DJing heh.

Exactly, but they are just examples of the fact that EQ doesn't come
first all the time. Put a LOT of work into the flat and added 60% to
it's value in 18 months. Not quite the image of a financially dependant
teenager that was being protrayed.

(incidently, the 'child' is actually now 17 years old, employed fulltime
as a nurse, and she's either at her boyfriends, or he's round ours. Most
of the raising is already done hehe)
