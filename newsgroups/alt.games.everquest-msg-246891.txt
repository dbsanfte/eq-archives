That's true, I was simply responding to why increasing guide powers
might be a bad idea. The lack of GM prepense is why I'm a FORMER
guide. I got tired of having to tell people that I really had no idea
when a GM would be around to look into their problem because *I* was
the one who caught flak over it. It was bad enough when GMs were
around at predictable times...
