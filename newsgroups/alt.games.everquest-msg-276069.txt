As it happens, I was looking for Brother Zephyl in RM last night, and
of course Hasten Bootstrutter, the jboots guy, is one of the PHs.  And
of course, since I wanted Zephyl, I had to kill Bootstrutter three times.
(Back when I was looking for Bootstrutter for my own jboots, I kept
finding Zephyl.  Nature maintains her delicate balance. :-)

Anyway, each time Hasten turned up, I'd /ooc to check if anyone was there
for the jboots so they could talk to the guy before I killed him.  And
indeed, one group did come over and talked to him while I stood off to
the side with my Iksar (/emote eyes the tasty-looking gnome).  They had
two people there for jboots, and after a bit they said he'd screwed them
on the second one so they were all in favor of me killing him. :-)

Heh, it would certainly be more realistic if the guy no longer had a set
of boots to give you after someone else has gotten a set (until he respawns,
for instance), but that's no how things usually work.  And taking people's
stuff without giving the boots is pretty rude.  Yum, *crunchy* gnome!
