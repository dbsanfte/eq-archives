IMHO this one is simple. The one thing you are lacking is a damage
dealer to back up your warrior. (No, the druid doesn't count.) Go with
the monk. The bard can add a lot to any group, but with a chanter and a
cleric already in there, you'll get more utility out of a massive damage
dealer. The monk is your play here. Rouge or wiz would have been even
better, but a good monk will do the trick.
