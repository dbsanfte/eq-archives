Or, one could say that people running a split are the ones that do 
enough at work, school, or whatever that they don't want to spend their 
free time on another grind.  Perhaps they like the split simply because 
when they kill something they like to see both bars move rather than 
just one.  Maybe it makes them feel more productive, maybe it makes them 
feel like they're multitasking, or maybe they just think watching 2 bars 
move is more entertaining than watching one bar move.  I don't think it 
really has anything to do with playing the game effectively.  IMO, an 
effective player is one who plays their class in a way that benefits the 
group, whether that means they tank, heal, cc, dps, or whatever.  How 
fast someone pumps out the exp has nothing to do with how effective they 
are at playing the game.
