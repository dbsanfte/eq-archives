From my tailoring guide (just pasted here because I don't feel like
retyping it :)

Deluxe sewing kits, to the best of my knowledge, are not available for
purchase at any merchant. These ten slot kits came into existence with
a series of patches in May 2001 - at one point, all large sewing kits
were changed from having eight slots to having ten. This meant that if
you already owned a large sewing kit, it automatically became a ten
slot kit. Large sewing kits purchased during this time also had ten
slots. However, in a later patch at the end of the month, the large
sewing kits were changed back to the eight slot variety. Any existing
ten slot large sewing kit that characters owned were renamed to Deluxe
Sewing Kits, and stayed in the ten slot configuration. If you are
fortunate enough to have one or more of the Deluxe sewing kits, I
recommend that you hang on to them.



Note - the above *may* not be correct. I've heard from two people who
have found them for sale in FV. I'm planning on going there soon to
check for myself.
