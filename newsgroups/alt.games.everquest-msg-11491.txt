It's best to increase your primary stats most. You could increase your stats
with items and such, but it it's worthwhile to spend your initial stats on
the things you will use the most. It will help during low-mid levels and
will require less slots for stat increasers in those areas at high levels.

Str increases damage output and sta increases hitpoints per level. Trust me,
being a warrior you want as much of these as you can. Dex and agi are also
nice, but wis, int and cha are rather pointless to increase.

I've restarted my lvl 10 mage after I only put 10 points in int initially. I
don't know if this is true, but I really have the idea that I can cast more
with +25 int (max initial increase in a stat) even during my startup period.
