The quickest way to level is to power-level. In order to power-level,
you have to convince a higher level player to help you out. You don't
group with this person, you just have them stand by and assist you
while you fight. Healers make good powerlevelers, and also anyone that
can clear a mob's hate list can powerlevel.

If this is a problem for you, you might want to quit EQ now. The only
way to stay sane in EQ, is to not obsess about exp gain. It is slow to
level in EQ. Get used to it.
