Plus, Wizards get Staff of Temperate Flux, which, as a side effect, resets
the spell gems.  Cast fast casting nuke, then click on the SoTF, and the
spell gems are back, so you can cast the nuke again.  (This doesn't always
work--I haven't figured out a pattern yet, but it usually works).  (Of
course, each click of the SoTF screams "hate me!" at the mob...so don't do
this if you are one of those Wizards who starts nuking too early :-)).
