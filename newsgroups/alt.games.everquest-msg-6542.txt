The DEs are in/near a cabin a bit SW of Rivervale.  There's a point on the
map where the path dips south and then west again (towards FP).  If you
follow the south part, just after you crest the hill, you will find
LOADING... PLEASE WAIT.

I was making the run a week ago at 11am gametime.  I'm even a rogue and know
that our epic is done in Kith - but I assumed it was much more off the
beaten path.  Well, I see a cabin and then see a figure.  In the course of
one round, I'd been hit about 4 times for 1200+ dmg, including an 881 point
Harm Touch.  An all time record for most damage taken at once.  Hehe, I've
never even fallen for that much.

At night, obviously, it's much worse.  At least nothing saw through
Hide/Sneak (including the big baddies) at night.
