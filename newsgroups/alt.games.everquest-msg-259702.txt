The only thing that springs to mind is I see you're at 191 jewelcraft.
Might be worth considering working that up to close to 250 (Doesn't take
too long with JC.) and do your grandmaster's eyeglass. That will give
you 50 cha in your range slot, allowing you to switch the backslot
maybe, (Several decent ones available in bazaar.) and perhaps exchange
the 13 cha ring for something cheap with higher hp/mana. (Most of them
are expensive, of course, but there's the BoT one with 75hp/mana, 3 to
all stats.)

Just a thought, since I see you've focused on cha;) Oh, and it'll get
you a nifty grandmasters backpack as well, 100% WR, 10 slots giant:)

Oh, and just one more footnote, I see you're working on archetype AA 
skills, you might consider working Spell Casting Mastery up to 3, will 
save you a considerable amount of mana. (Think Graffe's parsed it out to 
20-30% average on all casts..! Didn't bother to look it up again tho, 
but I've noticed a considerable difference.)
