Interesting Name's I have seen over the past few weeks of players on
Everquest The Kane Bayle Server.

1.Ozzfest

2.Rollinadube.

3.Stainedmattress.

4.CrappedmaPants

Ok correct me if I'm wrong but isn't the naming policy in effect to
prevent names like this.  I love Everquest and I just bought Shadow's
of Luclin so I now have all the Expansion's.  Maybe it's just me but
these are name's that I don't want to see when role playing. you know
in other games like quake or somthing you expect it I just thought
here was diffrent.  Any thought's on This.
