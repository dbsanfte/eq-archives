It's just that, you heal someone else for a large amount, greater than Heal
Other, but you also hurt yourself, and for a length of time you cannot heal
yourself, and probably cannot be healed by any means I think.  I've noticed that
as I leveled up I heal more with it, haven't bothered looking at how much I've
damaged myself, as I only used it in emergency cases when someone is about to
die and the Aura won't save them.

I don't have it yet but the Teleport Ally was useful when I've seen it.  Seen it
used to quickly get a group to the same area, and if someone died and we have to
run retreat, seen it used to summon the corpse and then proceeded to rez that
person.

Fun game, but like you we'll see what happens when the free month is up.  But it
won't fully replace EQ.  Let's hope the PoK crash bug and other annoyances are
fixed by then.  By the way, I did get stuck a couple of times in CoH, jumping
around, trying to get to different places.  /stuck command works wonders.  Most
of the time it unstuck me a few feet away, one time, in the middle of Perez
Park, it threw my back by a zone in.  That was annoying as I then had to run
back to group.
