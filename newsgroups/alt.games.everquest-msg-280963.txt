You know, I have to admit, looking at the AA list and seeing another 50 
tanking AA's I need to spend to stay in top form, I feel more than a 
little disheartenened.

Particularly with the diminishing returns trend of tanking AA's - it's 
likely these will be 5 AA's per 0.5% of mitigation or avoidance, or 
worse. 50 AA's for 5% - the kind of advantage you have to be parsing 
logs to notice.

Oh and of course there's some cool AA's in there that I've wanted for 
ages, but I'll have to hold off on them until the 50 tankers are down.
