Not quite. It was mostly 'wannabe hackers' (or in the lingo: 'script 
kiddies') people who couldn't cut code... but who had too much time on 
their hands and used it to master the (not-quite)-arcane art of reading 
an extended ascii chart, and/or were of the (not-quite)-mensa level 
which gave them the insight that the letter 3 was an E backwards...(or 
more likely someone else told them... that is mostly how script-kiddies 
work)

'leet', which is elite.. but the people who called themselves 'l33t' ... 
weren't, just wished they were. Few, if any, self respecting hackers 
would call themselves l33t.
