Thanks for the support, but no, as a necro I'm afraid sitting staring
at a spellbook isn't a frequent occurance.

Allure of Death is an 8 mana per tick boost, at the expense of
8 hp a tick.

I can pretty much constant pull high blues sprinkled with yellows
as fast as I can find them, only time I'm looking at spell book
is when the dots (especially Leach) are on and the mob is
feared and the pet clearly has things under control.

In fact sitting still gets me in more trouble than constant pulling,
since Leach has a much shorter duration than Allure... so I
can easily end up hurt pretty badly if I'm not fighting something.

My goal here is less what either of you have guessed than this:
I like to... well, you could call it exploit if you wanted... utilize
the abilities of various classes.  In this case, we are talking about
essentially free experience.  There is a down side, skills don't
go up when you do this.  Its like loot based leveling; you level
up on bone chips or CB belts or GLS, and you have the levels
but not the skills to practically use them... niether in terms of
skill points nor in terms of the personal experience of having
done the work.

I'd strongly advise against the practice unless you are quite
cautious about it.  Luckily, this is my 14th or 15th character,
I already have a fairly good idea how things work.  I also
make a point of doing about half of each level straight, to learn
how things work and to cap off skills.

It amuses me to find little things like this that various characters
can and can't do, thats all.  In this instance, it amused me a
great deal to find that I -couldn't- do this!

I'm trying not to do Crushbone, Oasis, LOIO... even though
thats a fine progression that will rapidly take any character
to level 30, I've been there, done that.  So its been BB
(been a long time since I did the place), Warrens (sucks
for soloing, like Befallen its either green mobs or a cluster
of blues), Kurns (wow, thats a good one I'd never tried)
Overthere (similar to LOIO, but with a handy set of vendors
and a bank... since I'm evil), and now playing around looking
for another  good spot for a few levels.  I keep hitting KFC,
but really its nothing new to me, and isn't actually all that great.

Higher levels are interesting only in that thats where the next
spell rank comes in, and I can play around with those some.
Necro isn't a vocation (I think cleric is) its a fun toy for me
for a while now, when my RL is too busy for me to be able
to group.  Unfortunately, he's now at the point where he
can solo really well... when what I need is a class that -does-
have the "stare at the spell book blues" so I can play for a minute
and then go AFK for five.
