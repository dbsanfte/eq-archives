The most-uber guilds across all servers can go into Sleepers and not
have the power to take the 4th warder.

There isn't a level limit of 55 on any of those zone. 'u need' <sic> 46
plus to do those raids. If you want to win fights, you can substitute
numbers and skill for levels. We've had several sub-L55s on raids in
those zones, not being able to go sub-L55 is a factor of your contacts
rather than your level, and that won't change if you're L60. Not many
public raids on those places, so you still need a bunch of high level
friends to raid there, and *they* are the ones imposing the level
restrictions, not Verant


You have to remember, the mobs you are talking about are the toughest
mobs on Norrath. If you could take them with a raid of L46-50, then a
dozen or less L60s could just as easily take them before you can blink.
There *have* to be things that are taxing for L60s to tackle, and this
means near impossible for L46s. Complaining that you can't kill
everything in the game in your mid 40s is pointless
