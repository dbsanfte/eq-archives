Hi all,

I posted a week or so ago hopeing for suggestions on where to hunt for
equipment. Since then I have improved my equipment a bit (Some cunning
camping prepatch helped me get a Testament 30 seconds post patch),
however I am still worried that my equipment sucks :-(

Currently I have about 100pp in the bank, but I should be able to earn
some cash over the next few levels so what should I look to improve
first ? What can I hunt for / quest for myself ? What can I buy cheap
off high levelers ? This is my highest level char so I guess that funds
will be limited to sub 500pp total, bearing in mind that my level 29
spells are looming.

Well here is what I have atm :

Ears     : Electrum Jasper Ear AC:0 Wis:2 *2
Neck     : Black Iron Meddalion AC:0 Wis:3 Int:3
Face     : Banded AC:4
Helm     : Savant's Cap AC:2 Wis:3 Int:3
Fingers  : Silver Jasper rings AC:0 Wis:2 *2
Wrist1   : Jaded electrum bracer AC:2 Wis:0 HP:10 Mana:10
Wrist2   : Ivory Braclet AC:0 Wis:0 Agi:3 Mana:20
Arms     : Bronze AC:8 Wis:0
Hands    : Spit Paw Gloves AC:4 Wis:2 Dex:3
Sholders : Frozen Mantle AC:6 Wis:0 Mana:10
Chest    : Sarnak Emblasened Tabard AC:14 Wis:0 HP:10 SvP:10
Back     : Ringmail Cape AC:6 Wis:0
Waist    : Thick Leather Apron AC:8 Wis:0
Legs     : Ringmail Pants AC:7 Wis:0
Feet     : Banded Boots AC:6 Wis:0
Shield   : Testament of Vanear AC:0 Wis:10 Mana:10

Totals AC:67 Wis:26 Mana:50 
(Int:6 Agi:3 Dex:3 SvP:10 HP:20)

I guess that some things are obvious like improving the Face Arms Back
and Boots, but what to change to ?

Oh I'm a Dwarf so my STR is ok, but even with the +26 wis it is only
130-ish.
And my weapons are *really* bad, not even worth mentioning, so what
could I look for in my primary hand ?

Thanks to careful play I don't agro much so don't get hit often so ac is
not my main concern.

Where to hunt ideas would be good too, Loio is getting dull.

Any cules willingly taken.
