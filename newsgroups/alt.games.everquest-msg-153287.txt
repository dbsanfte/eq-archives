Ah, memories *g*  Strangely, I cannot remember how I 'learned' the
game.  My first character was an erudite enchanter, WAY the heck back.
Needless to say, she never even got her tunic.  Why?  Because I fell
into a pool of water somewhere in a dark room where I couldn't see,
and hey, my note, spells and candle were still on her body - yay for
THAT change, I tells ya...

Really, just use google to read the newsgroup.  I think we all share
the stuff worth sharing (and not :D) in here, and since most of us
don't ever leave except to play EQ, it's a simple matter of getting
hold of the author for permission to use said story.
