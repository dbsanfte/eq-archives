Yep, that was sort of my point.  Any old healer should be able to handle

Well, an average of 2 active mobs on a 50 pull means a 96% total stun
average, which makes my point even more strongly than my original
98% total stun figure.  Damage is happening.  Not a lot of it, no, but
some.  And it sure would suck to have that trickle of damage eventually
kill the stunners.

Yes and no.  As I said before, the time when I was healing when I did
this was not during the nuking segment... heck I was busy blowing
all my mana as fast as I could on PB AOE's myself.  No, it was during
the buildup, where we had 12 mobs, 24 mobs, 36 mobs, ok now we
have around 50 time to start nuking!  Getting mobs into postition took
a while, while the nuke portion didn't take long at all.  As I recall, I did
Unspoken Word, Upheaval, Word of Healing (little group heal to take
care of all the people taking damage while I ignored them) Upheaval again,
Remedy anyone who needs it... if anyone at all, Upheaval again and by
this point most mobs were dead, perhaps Celestial Elixer the puller who
is likely tanking the leftovers.

I wish I could, but my game time is pretty limitted just now, which is
part of why I'm on the newsgroup so much.  That will clear back up
in a bit, and I have several people interested in working on this, so
its just a question of time.  But I figure the more theory I can hash out
here beforehand the more prepared I'll be when the balloon goes up.
