I've got a 21" monitor (it's a bit of an old one, but still works & is in
good condition) that will not show a picture on EQ in 640x480 resolution.
    The problem is that I have to blindly navigate the license agreement
(TAB+ENTER), then either wait for hit space twice to get to the intro video,
hit enter or space to bypass that, then hit enter once on the first options
screen, hit enter again to close the "You're not using the latest driver"
screen, enter my password, hit enter to log in, hit enter again for server
select screen, then I see the screen flicker back to windows as it adjusts
for 800x600 resolution, and displays the EQ loading screen, then I see the
character select screen, select my character, don't see the next EQ loading
screen (just black screen again as earlier), and then get into EQ and am
able to view it because I'm running 800x600 size, but if I change to 640x480
I lose picture again & have to wait for the timeout to occur to change my
screen size back for me to 800x600, which does work though I've not tested
other resolutions yet above 800x600, though I do know that Windows won't
display in 640x480 either, it does the same thing, though I've not re-booted
yet to see if when Windows detects the new monitor if it is able to fix the
problem or if my computer's entire boot-up process won't be visible unless I
use my ATI All-in-Wonder Radeon 7500 to constantly do TV-OUT to my other
computer's (also ATI, but much older) card so I can get some picture in
640x480 if this does become a problem.
    Any suggestions?
