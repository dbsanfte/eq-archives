Anything you give a pet is gone as soon as the pet goes away.  There are
very few, very far between exceptions to this (which require making
a pet turn rogue then killing it).

Warders are summoned at a set level, and have skills appropriate to 
that level.  They don't get better until you get the next higher summons
and summon a higher level warder.

Pets keep their own delay regardless of what the weapon delay is.  There
are only a couple instances where giving pets  weapons improves their 
damage enough to compensate for the loss of the weapon -

1.  At very low levels (for BL's I'd say only the level 9 pet) a high
damage/delay 2 hander will boost their damage output.  For mage pets
this has always been the rusty 2hander available at Hallard's resales
in EFP (up to the level 12 pet)

2.  Weapons with procs on them, ranging from gnoll hide lariats (stun)
to Ykeshas, or mage summoned weapons (about the only ones I'd give a
BL pet are the level 63 Fists of Ixiblat - IIRC warders were made to 
be BL's in terms of their weapon skills, so you want to stay away from
1hs)

Warders are summoned at a fixed level, and are believed to be BL's,
so it would be reasonable that their weapon skills are the same as
a BL of their level.

It's been a while since I tracked this - do a search for
eqbeastlord - there's a forum for them.
