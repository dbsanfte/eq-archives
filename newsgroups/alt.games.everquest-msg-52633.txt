Nope, I belive he was right. As far as I can tell, if a mob has 100 hp and a
warrior takes down 99 of them, then a caster lets loose with any dd spell
that does more than 100 hp, he will get credit for the kill, even though it
took only 1 of those damage points to kill off the mob. I have been on both
ends of this, and I believe it to be the case.
