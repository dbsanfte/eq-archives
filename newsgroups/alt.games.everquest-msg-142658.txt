 Necro is a good choice for Balatin. Just as long as they charm it
instead of mezzing. The only bad choice for things like this, in my
opinion, is a bard, since they don't have fixed duration charm.

 Flute is for Whistling Fists quest and not the epic. Both are turnins
with Brother Balatin. It's been awhile since I've done it but I don't
think the flute was overly hard to get. Two bandit notes in Field of
Bone, turn them into someone in Cabilis and bing, new flute.

 I got lucky on Chardok piece and he ended up standing at the end of the
lev tunnel when we got there. I wasn't so lucky with Karnors piece
though. That took a few months.
