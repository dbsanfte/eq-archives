Why *should* you know, beyond what /con tells you? Most characters are
not mindreaders.

I like it the way it is. The only real problem was the factions didn't
interact with each other, so you could be great friends with the mage
guild and hated by the cleric guild of the same city, for example. The
solution was that mobs should be on more than one faction (different
than "alter" more than one faction, there's many of those).
