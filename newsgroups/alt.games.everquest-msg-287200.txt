Yes, I have had a look at that but unfortunately the problem there is that 
it would be illegal to use SOE's intellectual property this way and 
therefore even if they get it running it would not be up for long I don't 
think. I could be wrong about this too but it seems to me they (SOE) own 
EverQuest and nobody else can make some variant of it and release it without 
them closing it down.
