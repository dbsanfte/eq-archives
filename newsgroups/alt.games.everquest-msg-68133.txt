I think your being a bit harsh. I use the web a lot and I don't
disagree with you about the usefulness of the information. But to me
the guide books still have value. I used the Kunark 2nd edition
extensively __while in-game__ and will get the Luclin book also. I
think guide books and the web fill two different, complimentary rolls.
