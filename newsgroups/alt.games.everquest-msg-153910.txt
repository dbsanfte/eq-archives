Rouges are already broken, apparantly because nobody can
fucking spell that word.

Chaotic stab damage is always the same amount of damage,
and quite frankly, with a 16 dmg piercer 120 is around what
my regular triple/quad attacks are.

Chain a mistake?  Rogues have always been a chain-at-the-most
class, however in P&P games, you paid for it by having negatives
to sneaking and hiding...but at higher levels, even the negatives
were easily overcome AND you probably had enough magic armor
with bonuses and soundlessness that it didn't matter anyways...

Sorta like the fact that a level 18 rogue in EQ wearing nothing at
all can still fail a sneak or hide attempt, but a level 60 assassin
in plate-look armor chock-full of magical badassness doesn't.
Ever.
