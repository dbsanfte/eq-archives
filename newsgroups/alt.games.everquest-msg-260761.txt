If im assuming anything, and am wrong, go reply to my still un-answered post
from yesterday and tell me where i am wrong.  For that matter, reply to any
single post of mine where i expanded on why "any random bozo outpulls a monk
in any zone situation" is a wrong statement, made by a moron.

I replied with facts and experience, so just keep holding onto the "elitist"
ace card, that way you don't have to expand on any of your wrong claims and
bullshit posts either trying to be insulting, or just plain retarded.

Best puller doesn't come down to class. It comes down to skill, know-how,
and the right tools for the right environment.  these things change. Like i
said I gave 2 examples of zones in posts yesterday.  Put up, or shut the
fuck up.  Or i guess just keep playing your "ace" elitist card, so I know
you aren't in for a serious debate that merits my time and effort, and just
some random dipshit.
