Biz...

1) People have this information occasionally on EQ and regularly
on other services. It is useful, and nobody is suggesting locking
the VI reps in an icey room with ammonia until they provide it.

Grow up.

2) Other games do provide those numbers; at least last time I played
DAOC it did, Unreal it did, etc.

Sometimes you're so hardassed I wonder if you come to post here for
tension relief or something ;)
