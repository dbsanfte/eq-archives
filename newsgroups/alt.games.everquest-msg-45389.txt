There may be a way.

There's a nice little utility to make ICS configuration easier.  Can
be found here:
http://www.practicallynetworked.com/sharing/ics/icsconfiguration.htm

Download, install and then go here:
http://www.practicallynetworked.com/sharing/ics/icsconfig_maps_pg2.htm
and grab the Everquest .ics file.

Load that up and see what happens.

Some other (somewhat dated) ICS info can be found here as well:

Enjoy.
