I'm pretty partial to DE's because of the ease with which I can roleplay them.
Dwarves also, I'd love to RP.  The only other character I'd play would a be a
good erudite caster.  I can most easily roleplay these from my exp.  Halflings
I have trouble with, and I'd hate having to constantly be in troll and ogre
mode.  Although, a human or iksar would be a lot of fun. "Revelation of the
day: It's not the heat, it's the humidity."  I could live with a monk.
