Gnome football:  you can consent up to about 8 people (well you can consent
as many as you want but only the first 8 or so will be able to drag your
corpse).

Kill off a gnome for the "ball."  Put the gnome on the 50 yard line & the 2
teams try to drag it to their goal.  Do it in an Arena for added fun (PVP).

----
Drunken Gnaked Gnome Gnewbie races:
Level 1 gnomes, go PVP by turning in the book of discord to the Priest of
Discord.  This is essential as it prevents any sort of cheating (assuming,
of course, that you're not on a Zek server) because only other Reds can buff
PVP players...and how many of those have you seen outside the bazaar? :).

Anyway, first race is short.  Liquor up the gnomes & send them to the
Kelethin bank.  See how many fall off the lifts and go splat. :)

Much longer race...do either with or without liquor:  Send them to Erudin.

In either case, POK is NOT an allowed shortcut.
