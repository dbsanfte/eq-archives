If the servers have more than about 2200 people on them then you start
experiencing server lagg , And at some point you are going to start wanting
to play on the most crowded not the least crowded . There is an optimal
number of people , both more or less is bad.

For instance if I was giving advice on a server assuming you had no friends
to join it would be this . Find the server with a good balance between high
level and low level characters that has about 1500 people , never has more
than 2200, and has not been part of a server split .

Of course no such server is around but still maybe you get the point :)
