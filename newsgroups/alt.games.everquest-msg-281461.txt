	Ok, so, the group: ranger, warrior, cleric, chanter,shaman, and
rogue.  Ranger is pulling.  Ranger comes back with snared mobs, and
proceeds to keep aggro for long enough to require multiple heals.  Warrior
says in group "Can you use jolt, please?"  Ranger says "Sorry, don't
have spell slot open for it. Why don't you taunt?"

	Well, the warrior says he is taunting, but taunt fails a lot. 
The ranger basically says tough, too bad you're not uber :-)  Eventually
the cleric pulls heal aggro trying to keep the ranger puller/tank alive
and gets one rounded, the warrior says "bye, gonna go, ummm, work on
my baking or something..." and we break up.

	Soooooo... My question is WHAT spells could that ranger have
needed more than jolt and what could we have done here besides letting
the cleric pull? :-)  My understanding was that rangers ALWAYS used
jolt.

	I have a feeling this is a case of "I did 20 levels last week
so of course I know how to play my class"
