I'm never earned so much experience in such a short time on so many 
characters.  Neither has my wife.  We've never grouped as much as this, 
as often, with even our own guild, until LDoN.  I haven't seen this many 
people in guild at once before LDoN.  I have never seen people 'chain' 
grouping as much as this before.

I've met more other players in the past month and a bit than ever 
before, and grouped with them regularly more often than ever, and we've 
recruited more unguilded players to our guild than in any other month.

LDoN for *me* is the most accessible and most enjoyable expansion 
to-date.  I love it.
