My druid is level 52.
My wizard is level 48
My enchanter is level 57
My brother's cleric is 60 (of course I borrow him when I die)
MY cleric is level 30

I so rarely go /role that you might as well say I never do.
*I* can say "no, sorry," or ignore the tell altogether, if I either don't
have time or don't feel like helping.  I'm never rude (unless you consider
no answers rude, in which case I don't really give a damn :p ) I've found
that to be a necessary skill in life and EQ.  It's my feeling that only
pushovers hide.

Can I have 10 bucks please? :)

John?  Lokari?   Boy, it's gotten suddenly quiet....
