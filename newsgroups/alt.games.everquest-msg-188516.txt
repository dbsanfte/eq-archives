(snip big secrets about leather padding))
Then use the enter/return key to make paragraphs ;)

The leather padding route is fine but lately I've found that
components sell just as well and save time. I dumped all the hides I'd
saved, as well as silk(spiderling and spider), on a vendor at
reasonable prices while upping HQ bear and Cat. It all sold pretty
fast to people who were going to make padding with it or do something
else, such as backpacks or quivers. 

After being overnight in the bazaar afk, I usually wake up with 1 k
plat or more. I usually sell everything.
