Funny, seems to me you were talking about your accusation - "You
basically stranded 18 people". Clearly, though, he didn't strand them.
As Ben pointed out, many classes have the ability to gate, and thus
were not any more stranded than the druid. Those classes that don't
have gate were still blessed with perfectly functional legs, which
would easily carry them out.
