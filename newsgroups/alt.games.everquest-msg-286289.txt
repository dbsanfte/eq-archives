There is no problem with not medding up to full after each fight, as
long as each fight is easy enough to make that safe.  To a point, I
agree.  If I solo a light blue, and it takes me from full to 80% HP
and 60% mana, then on the next fight I'll cast fewer spells and take a
bit more damage, to end up 40% HP and 40% mana.  This isn't the issue
- it's exactly the kind of balancing that Lance suggested.

This does not stay all the same, when it comes time to med up.  Sure,
if I'm at 50% HP and 0% mana, I'll med up 50%, have half mana and then
be good to go, using less mana for this round of fights to try to
achieve "even bars" the next time around.  The inefficiency here is
that there is not zero cost for medding up.  You have to spend the 30
second out-of-combat wait time before the rapid med rates kick in.  If
I don't try to stop with even bars, I have to suffer that 30 second
induction time more often.

What has not yet been discussed is whether you can actually come out
ahead by using resources unequally.  For example, if I burn mana, can
I kill sufficiently more quickly that it's worth it for me to burn to
10% mana still with 90% HP?  At that point, do I kill faster by
medding to full then burning more mana, or letting a few chew down my
HP before medding again?  I'm guessing that for some pure casters/
priests (wizards spring to mind), burn&med might turn out to be
better, but I'm not sure that it is for hybrids.

My main is a beastlord; I plead ignorance of optimal soloing for other
classes.  Certainly as a 66 beastlord, I cannot increase my solo DPS
*that* much to make running myself empty of mana more efficient than
mowing through low light blues with minimum mana expenditure. A lot of
my DPS comes from swinging weapons (while necessarily getting swung
at), not just casting.  In short, I agree with Lance's theory, as it
applies to my beastlord.

I suspect this may not apply to, say, a higher level druid, who
generates most of his solo DPS through spells and wonders why he still
even carries weapons. :)  A few thwacks on my 55 druid's head remind
me to reach for the Root or Snare spellgem, not to come suicidally
close to dying in the name of efficiency. :)  I would guess that even
a shaman's melee DPS starts to become insignificant compared to spells
at some point.  Once that's true, then losing HP is bad.  Spells get
interrupted by melee strikes, slowing down DPS considerably.  For
example, soloing druids try to kite or root/dot while taking (ideally)
no melee damage because, for their skill set, it is most efficient,
even though they can heal themselves.
