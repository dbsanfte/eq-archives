There's been claims of mass account cancellation when EQ changed the
UI a year ago and broke so many of the older and custom UI.  There's
been threat of mass cancellation when SOE fixed a broken vet AA a
little over a month ago which inadverantly gave everyone the next AA
for free.

There always will be those outcry but rarely people actually cancel
the account over trival things.  Rollback due to accidental beta NPC
issue, yes but broken UI or petition isn't likely to get mass
cancellations.  

I mean the old system was broken anyway, half of the time you
petitioned for something they give canned reply that doesn't do shit.
When the GM actually do something about petition, and you got more
than cookies and milk, consider yourself lucky.  Once I tried to
petition for missing item (extremely rare no drop item that vanished
due to bug), the response was an explaination on how to upgrade the
PoR warhorse to a faster mount.  I think I still have a screenshot of
that response...
