OK, punish may not be the correct word, but I think a large number of 
players will use EXACTLY that term if it is implemented.  I personally 
have no problem with hell levels, but since I'm beyond them my opinion may 
mean less than usual.
The cleanest way to remove hell levels WITHOUT removing the total EXP 
required to reach 60 is to smooth out the hell multiplier.  Doing so would 
cause a *perceived* EXP loss for character in all levels 31+ OTHER than 
hell levels and the levels directly preceeding hell levels.  The hue and 
cry over this would be immense.  I hope this is just a rumor.
