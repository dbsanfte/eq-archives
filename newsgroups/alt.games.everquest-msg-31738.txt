Whats the punch line?
Almost as funny as youre election. Dont americans also have a habit of
portraying the japanese with thick lensed glasses and protuding teeth? Is the
nation denture fixated or something.
And i have to say american teeth are so ridicilously perfect as to look quite
absurd. When you guys smile you display what looks like a set of tomb stoned
size piano keys, so capped, polished and buffed they look utterly fake.
I would go into the loooong standing jokes we have at your expense but my
newseader will only permit posts under 500 lines in length.
