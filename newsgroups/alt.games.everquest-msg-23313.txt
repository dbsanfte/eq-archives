Can anyone give me some recommendations for a good weapon that I can buy for
my High Elf Lvl 14 Paladin?

I currently have a Velium Long Sword that was very kindly given to me at
Level 9, but since then my hitting has maxed out at about 12/13 HP.  I have
a SBS that I'd like to keep using so a single handed weapon is preferred.

I have about 70pp to spend.

Thanks for your help

Happy Hunting )
