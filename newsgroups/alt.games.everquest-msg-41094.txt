Well, consider Torpor, level 60 shaman healing spell.

It does a very nice amount of healing, 1200 points over 24 seconds, for a
piddly little 200 mana.   However it has a downside.  The person it is cast on
becomes snared, and has a 30% attack speed reduction for those 24 seconds.

If you could just click it off, the shaman could cast it on you when you were
down 600 hp or whatever, and you could cancel the spell after you were full,
and be attacking normal speed for the final 12 seconds.

With the current way it will work, Torpor will be one of the spells that lasts
24 seconds no matter what.
