And deny you the "joy" of experiencing BenInGodMode with a full
head of steam?  I can recall seeing precisely one instance where
he backed off after the thrashing began, and that was in a thread
where he was repeatedly contradicted by multple posters regarding
some flat assertion he made about voluntarily losing your surname.
And even then he switched without apology from "this is the way it
is" to "well all I was saying is that this is what happened to me".
Once he starts there's really not much point in replying, tho it
can be interesting to read the posts of the person he's inflicting
his special brand of "argument" on.  Sometimes he makes interesting
posts tho, so I can't bring myself to killfile him.  This group is
often a better source of entertainment than the game itself, and
he's not by any means unentertaining.
