Then I lose all my lewts and people laugh at me and call me gimp.

Hmm.. Kinda like I do to most other people...

When I'm wandering across the Druid's grove or eqdruids boards, I
compulsively hit everyone's profile, and I see, Hmm, epic, 2 potc
earrings... split paw gloves... mithril runed tunic... 6 wis rings...
gatorscale legs... GIMP.

But it's not like I actually reply and say "gimpdruid01, your gear sucks"

Though I do heartily enjoy verbally abusing the morons who want a kitty
litter shield to wear (shield of bane warding).

VIVA LA OOIV!
