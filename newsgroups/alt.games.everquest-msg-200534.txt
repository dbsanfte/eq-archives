    One of my guildmates has been working on a "dolls"-type interface for
creating EQ avatars. "Dolls" are generic bases, which are customized with
drag-and-drop items and drop-down menus for colours. Well, the project is
finally finished!

www.eqpixelarmy.com

    Once you've created your avatar, you can dump the screen to clipboard
(they explain how to do this in the forums, if you don't know how already)
and from the clipboard to your favourite paint program. A few quick tweaks
and you have yourself a very nice .sig for use on web message boards! The
detail is terrific, and the interface is really simple to use. The only
things I noticed missing so far are glowing balls and shields (as hand-held
items), and I've been told those are in the works. And since my guildmate
contributed a lot of the artwork, you DO have a lot of the high-end weapons
and held items like books on sticks, PoP weapons, even the Blade of War
model!

    Please check it out, and post your feedback! My guildmates have already
wasted countless man hours at work playing with it. ;-)
