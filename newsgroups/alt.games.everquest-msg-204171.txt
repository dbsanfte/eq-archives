Most bard haste songs take up the same slot as spell haste. There are
a few high level ones that do stack with both but those top out at
around 25%(?) haste. You do see some of the lower level haste songs
where the icons stack with haste spells, due to the fact that those
songs have other benefits that still kick in even if the haste part is
being overwritten by a faster spell.
