LOL!!  I'm gonna have to try that sometime.. :)

Here's my take on it...  If I'm camping a mob, and I have the mana to spare,
and someone comes up to me (I will not hunt someone down across the zone), I
will gladly buff them.  Provided they are polite to me, and don't act like
I'm -expected- to do so.  If the mob is about to spawn, I will ask them to
wait until I'm done.  Generally, I won't port if I'm camping a mob, because
9 times out of 10, the camp will be taken by the time I get back.
Exception:  Guildies, I will port.

Nothing hacks me off more then this scenario.  Just port in to WC:

LOADING... PLEASE WAIT.
soandso #1 tells you "Can you port me to BB plz"
soandso #2 tells you "I need a port to DL"
soandso #3 tells you "need sow for cr"
You have entered West Commons

Sheesh...  Not even zoned completely in, and getting pounded with
requests... :)
