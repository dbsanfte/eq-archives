I have been experimenting more with this since I posted, and turned on the 
badword filter on two characters in my fourbox army.


Those two characters, and only those two, have since that seen that 
happening a lot. First letter becomes a capital one, and last letter with 
the punctuation disappears.

The bad word filter is bad.
