Ever seen a drawing of your average cerebral neuron?
Anything that could synthetically replace them, one at a time, with
every single connection (there are more crosslinks in a human brain
than there are atoms in the universe, or something like that) working
as it should, would damn well *deserve* to be as conscious as the
original.
