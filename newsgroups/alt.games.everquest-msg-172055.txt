I was providing examples of nicknames in medieval literature.  I thought
that's what you asked for.

The distinction is blurry.  EQ isn't RL, but my experience of EQ is part of
my RL.  My natural proclivities will show themselves.

As mentioned before, it's a diminutive.  From dictionary.com:

2. Grammar. Of or being a suffix that indicates smallness or, by semantic
extension, qualities such as youth, familiarity, affection, or contempt,
as -let in booklet, -kin in lambkin, or -et in nymphet.

It sounds like you don't think fantasy characters should use diminutives,
but I can't figure out why that is.

I play because I like the people (and what they say).  The game itself is
boring and ugly compared to most popular video games.  If you don't like the
people and the things they say, why do you pay?

Again, you want EQ players to avoid diminutives.  Why?

I disagree.  I think you want to seem "cool" by showing your contempt for
nicknames.

If you derive self-worth, identity or individuality from EQ then I question
your level of maturity.

But that's exactly what happens outside EQ.  People make up new words to
replace perfectly functional old words.  Otherwise we wouldn't have Old,
Middle and Modern English, High and Low German, or Ancient and Modern Latin.

Why use the 1950's hip expression "sock hop" when "dance" would suffice?

What does an immersive RP experience sound like to you?  Is it one where
everyone uses the terms provided by Sony without modification or addition?
