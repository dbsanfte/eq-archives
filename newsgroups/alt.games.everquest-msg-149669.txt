DoT's do more damage per mana spent than nukes... but only if they
get to run out their full timer.  If the mobs are dying before DOT
duration
runs out, then you are likely going to get better damage per mana
ratio out of a nuke.  Then again, if mobs are dying that fast, its
probably
more worthwhile to use mana pumping it to the clerics or mezzing,
and just let your pet help melee.

Oh, don't let that stop you from putting the various "steal and give to
yourself (or your group)" spells, even though many have a DOT
effect, they are quite worthwhile no matter how long the mobs
live.
