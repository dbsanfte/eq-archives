For tradeskills, there are two checks made for each combine.  First, 
whether or not you have a successful combine and make what you are trying 
to make is a function entirely of your skill and the difficulty of the 
item in question.  There is still some debate about what the formula is, 
most of which can be found here:

The second check is to see whether or not you get a skill up, and this is 
where the stats come into play.  In general, the primary stat that matters 
is the higher of your WIS or INT.  It is known that STR is important for 
Smithing, and that DEX is important for fletching, jewelcraft, and 
-possibly- tailoring, but there is still some debate about exactly how:  
One school of thought maintains that (to use smithing as an example) the 
skill up check is made using the highest of INT, WIS, or STR.  The other 
school maintains that the check is against highest of INT or WIS, and then 
a secondary check is made against STR if it fails the first check.  In 
either case, there have been many successful smiths who only bothered to 
increase their STR and left INT and WIS alone.  My favorite are the 
'drunken smiths', who get as drunk as possible (which lowers your INT and 
WIS to practically nil, and raise your STR a few points) and then hang on 
to the forge with both hands and commence the combining. :)

I believe Verant has officially said that the first case is the truth 
(highest of the 3), but they have ben wrong about these things before, and 
plenty of people still insist it works the other way.  Some of them even 
provide very real-sounding evidence.  So my troll smith I'm vaguely 
planning is gonna be real strong and smart. :)

For any further tradeskill info you need, try www.eqtraders.com.  If you 
can't find it in the main board, and it isn't on the message board 
somewhere, odds are even Verant doesn't now. :)
