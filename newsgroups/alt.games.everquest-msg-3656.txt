It is fortunate because the world's best get to compete. It was
necessary because of cheating. "Amateurs" from countries like the
Soviet Union used to have jobs, they were Red Army Soldiers. Their
entire job consisted of training and competing in their respective
sports. Compare that with a hockey player from Canada. If he was an
amateur, he was either two young to play professionally, or just not
good enough.
