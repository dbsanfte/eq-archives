Thanks for all the responses seems like I did the right thing all said
and done - in answer to Morts could I have saved him - with great ease
I could have saved him I just didnt want too, he got us wiped out
three times although I didnt die the others did, it is only a game but
one person ruined three others game play - wish I did just disband him
though (why is there always a simple answer)
