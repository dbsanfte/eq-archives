Piffle....

It bothers this Necro to no end!  I usually /auc my ability to summon
corpses at the entrances to the planes so that everyone knows that I am
ready. willing and able (for the right cash cosideration) to summon a corpse
from under te feet of Ubermob_978.  I just lost a significant cash in-flow.
Guess I'll just start offering ports with my... Er, ok, Clarity 2 with
my...(WHAT?!?!?), umm, ok.  Maybe I'll just hunt for a while (if I remember
how).
