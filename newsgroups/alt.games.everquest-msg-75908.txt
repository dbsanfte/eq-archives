So, obviously, if you've never been on a Hole raid and never plan to,
this may not be the thread for you. ;-)

As the subject implies, I'd like yet another tip from you experienced
Hole raiders on the attack strategy for Yael. We've already determined
that we can have a level one halfling rogue camped down there to go in
and take the first DT after we clear the roamers. My question is, what's
next? Ideally, I'd like to see our guys fire a range weapon and try to
pull him closer to the tunnel, but will that work? Or will he just stand
there on his ramp and cast on us until his DT recycles? 

I guess rushing the ramp is doable, but my concern is that with a few
dozen bodies slamming around, somebody will wander into Nortlav's aggro
radius and drag him into the fight. And if that's the case...... fight
over.

So, how do you approach the initial attack on this guy once he shoots
his DT up front?
