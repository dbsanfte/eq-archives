anywhere if you have the money. there are dozens of different robes with
different looks around. some of the way different ones are Orcle Robe.
Shiney Metallic robe noble robe.
you might pick up the first for around 300pp
noble robe 100 or less... SMR is like 6k though.
once you get out into the work start isnspecting people and take note of the
roibe names
