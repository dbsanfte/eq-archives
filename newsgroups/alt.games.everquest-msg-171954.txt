49 selos and Battlecry of the Vah Shir are both minute+duration songs.  Bards
also frequently slap Aria of Eagles from SS boots on, and Shield of Flame off SS
bracers as well.  4 song twist is far from impossible, I do it all the time now
and I've never claimed to be a great bard.  This means 8 buffs from a single
bard is not at all out of the realm of possibility, in fact I also frequently
run Amplification, which means I've got 9 buff  slots spoken for if I'm running
buff only songs in my twist... of course thats self only (amp is) and I don't
actually do that, since at least one song I'm singing is almost always somethign
targetted at our victim.

Still, in a group I could see running selo/battlecry/haste/aria/SS DS/dex
song/DS song/resist song as a reasonable combination, if not for the fact that
this would leave only 6 slots open for buffs... when the new box comes in I'll
be one happy bard!

This is group dependant.  Often its true, sure.  But if your group is sitting
down waiting for mana to come back, with everone healed up and ready other than
that one item, then no.  Manaflow CAN be king, depends on the group.

Now thinking that if you aren't in a group where manaflow is king, then a bard
is a waste of your time, thats ignorant.  Bards can contribute in lots of other
ways, and in most groups you are better off with them doing so some if not all
the time.

Mansong stacks with KEI.  If you are using mana faster than you are regenning
it, then more mana flow means more dead mobs faster.  Mana flow is, in some
groups, THE defining facet of the game.  If you can't burn thru mana faster than
you make it back with KEI on, then yes, the manasinger isn't doing anything for
you... but if you can, and have been consistently, then a bard is a good way to
get even more mana.  Would you turn down Tranquility, or C5, wanting to keep KEI
instead?
