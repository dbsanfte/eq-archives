Just saw Lord of the Rings. Oh my bloody freaking hell. I went well beyond
loving it. It was just the way I imagined it all those years ago when
reading the books. And having always been a big fan of Legolas (quite
possibly the coolest guy ever) I can but conclude...

BEING A ELVEN RANGER ROCKS!!!!

See, this is the main advantage of being a ranger. Sure, you're class could
use a little work here and there. Sure, you're not going to be an eq god.
But you are a ranger. No matter what anybody will ever say about you in eq
again, you can just thumb your nose and say "ha, but I'm a ranger"

Now, if only I could convince Verant to make some long white hair graphic.
