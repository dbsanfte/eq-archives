The primary objective of the page is to be the EMarr forums. Ogmuk
likes a.g.e, Ogmuk decides to share a.g.e with the EMarr community
members that are unaware of it, and invariably people start using it
and forget (despite many, many mentions) that the one section of the
page that constitutes the a.g.e feed is NOT part of their usual little
playground, and come across as clueless when they post.

Lurkerr is a weirdass there too, incidentally.
