It was 4 years ago, but I remember distinctly :

Lost in FP

First boat trip

Lost in Kelethin (no lawn darts though)

Discovering that the maps in the manual
were WRONG

Dying and losing all the stuff I'd looted and
coin I'd made, and again, again and again because
I didn't know /loc and corpses poofed in 30min.

Finally finding the bank, saving enough cash
to get the #4 song so I'd never lose my corpse
again.

First venture out into EC - lions run as fast
as I do

Oh - I can't hit willowwisps.

Many, MANY MANY corpse runs into EC, frantically
trying to loot my corpse before something stumbled
on me and killed me (no /corpse command, no right
click to loot) 

Dinging level 9, dinging level 9, again - again
again.  Thought the name 989 studios was VERY 
appropriate about then, as that's what my level
did.

Learning to pull to the zone wall in EC to fight
so as to avoid adds

Noting that the icon for Selos was still up when
Jonthan's came on and wondering if both were actually
in effect at once - tested with Chant and Jonthan's
!! they do !!

Realizing that Snakes were always available - and that
my healsong with a lute was enough to keep me alive until
the poison passed (not anymore, that poison is 8 per tick
instead of 6 now)

Still dying MANY times because I thought I could finish
a fight with a snake and get my lute in hand before the
poison finished me.

Griffin - 'nuff said.
WC Griffin, HG - 'nuff said

typing "Hail" without hitting enter
 
accidentally hitting the hotkey for
CoD next to merchants.

Venturing into Highpass way too early
and getting backstabbed and dying on
my way out.

Going through Highpass at 16, getting
lost and going into a cave and getting
killed.

Making it though Highpass and lagging a
bit on the ramp at bard speed - SPLAT.

Making it to Qeynos finally, and having
to beg someone, ANYONE for a bind - paid
1pp of my very slim earnings for that.
Unlike KEI, you NEEDED to bind.

Spending my life savings at 9 on a tentacle
whip (magic) so I could hunt wisps - and
discovering the proc would freeze my songs.

Dropping the whip between hotkeyed inventory
boxes in a swap from instruments to weapons -
no confirmation box back then - never found it.

Training out of Befallen at 16 while trying 
to help a lower level recover her corpse, and
getting bugged (found myself in a room below
WC with pictures of a domestic cat on the wall,
GM came and got me out, but I was naked and he
couldn't find my body anywhere.  No reimburse-
ment policy back then.  The near complete suit
of banded, dragoon dirk and dwarven axe that
I'd spent almost all my savings (150pp) on were
gone for good)

All these deaths were at twice the death penalty
from before they REMOVED the death penalty for
1-10.  

No maps

Having skills lag is a result of making the first 10 levels too
easy.  My bard had 1hs, defense, offense and singing maxed by
about level 5.  If I'd known back then to get 1hb and piercing
up, they would have been trivial to max before 10.  I started a
bard on another server, to see if I could do it better with my
knowledge - and was able to max piercing, 1hb, 1hs, singing,
strings, percussion all by level 10.  I also maxed sense heading
(I started it back then with 20 points - SH increases mainly on
success, making the first skill gains VERY painful).  My shaman
had max Def, Off, 2hb, 1hb by 11 or 12 (started about 6mo after
release).

Sorry, but I have to agree with Graeme, the only way to make
1-10 more trivial than they are now is to make a /newbiebuff
command that makes them level 10 with all the appropriate skills
maxed and a set of newbie armor.

1-10 already go by too fast for many new players to learn some
really basic skills (both player and character).  When combined
with the zero penalty death brings, I'm suprised players don't
quit because it's too boring.  We've already seen what happens 
to the level 10 who suddenly had to find his body on death.  If
he'd learned that lesson with only his newbie gear on his body
(which respawned on you until level 4) it would have been far
less painful.
