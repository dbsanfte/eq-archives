Little note:  I go back to help pl a buddy in Oasis a bit last night and
this time I come back packin' trackin'.  I was able to pull, non-stop
caimans from WAY out in the water I was tracking while everyone else seemed
just as happy /ooc'n and /shout'ing about KS'ers and this and that.

Wondered a bit about tracking stuff out on the water.  Is levitate the way
to do it so I can pretty much run normal speed out across the water and
attack from the surface?  I kept getting chewed on a bit on the long pull
back to the beach.
