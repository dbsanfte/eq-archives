While it pains me to yet again admit the stupidity of myself and my
friends, we tried helping out on the monk quest mob in DL (the one that
kicked off this discussion, I think) this past weekend. We assembled a
nice little force there, with 60 cleric/tank, myself, and some other
friends there to stomp on the angry level 60 monk that spawns after the
turnin.

The guild monk we were helping asked for the creature to be mezzed for
the turnin. The mob was mezzed and ate the item. Monk lost flute, quest
failed.

The really pathetic part? We didnt' have a chanter there, so the mob was
mezzed by my wife's NECRO. We has somebody there who could have charmed
the mob in a heartbeat, and none of us thought to say, "Oh, wait. Don't
use screaming terror. Maybe we should charm it."

/sigh

Anyway, to answer the question being posed... No. You can't do that
turnin while that mob is mezzed. He's got to be charmed. This applies to
the Concussion skellie in CoM as well for us wizzies.
