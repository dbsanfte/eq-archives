This is only my opinion, but flame away if you must.

The tank's main job is not to do damage, that's secondary.  His main
job is to keep the mobs in a pull aggroed on him and not on the
casters.  Seems pretty self-evident, right?

However, 90% of the time, this is what you'll see, especially in
less-experienced groups:

Puller comes in with 3 mobs (let's assume mobs of equivalent level, so
there's no urgency in getting any particular one).  The tanks all,
quite rightly, start wailing away on the same one.  But they're
getting ganked, so the cleric has to cast a big heal or two.  Now the
two non-engaged mobs run over to Mr. Cleric and start beating the snot
out of him.  90% of the time, the tanks will simply ignore this until
the cleric actually says something and continue trying to kill the
first mob.  Watching how much they're hitting for or something.
Meanwhile, the poor cleric is trying to root, having it fail more
often than not, and is certainly no good to the party while he's
trying to get away from the mobs so he can heal.

This is just wrong.  You need to pay attention.  The moment the two
unengaged mobs leave, you should be asking yourself where they're
going, since in all likelihood they're going to beat the snot out of
someone in your party who can take getting hit even less than you can.

So in my opinion, at least one of the tanks should follow the other
two mobs the *instant* they leave and get them aggroed back on him.
An engaged caster is a useless caster.

Now sure, sometimes you have an enchanter you can rely on in
situations like that, and quite often the other casters will help out.
A good cleric will have enough AC and Defense that he can take a few
hits.  But way too often the tanks pay absolutely no attention and
then yell at the caster for running when they finally *do* realize
he's in trouble.  ("I can't help you if you run around"....to which my
reply is, why the hell didn't you help me *before* I got so low in hit
points that my only recourse is to run?)

I know there are going to be many posts telling me how this situation
can be handled, but that isn't the point.  I know it can be handled.
The point is that the bloody tanks should *help* handle it.

Flame away.
