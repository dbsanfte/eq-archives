I think it depends a lot on the situation.  If he's working and she's
a stay at home wife, I think he has every right to expect her to do
most of the housework.  Now on the other hand if they both work, they,
of course, should share the housework duties.  

Of course, my better half and I have a different problem, we fight
over who gets to use the computer to play EQ.  We're already saving up
to buy a second computer. :)
