Just a quick followup to say that I got email from SOE Support today
acknowledging that I was entitled to remain on the 6th Anniversary plan,
and directing me to a web page that would handle the details.  From what
they say, it sounds like they'll refund me for any unused portion of the
sub that I signed up for when the $99 rate failed to renew.  They also
offer an extra 30 days free as compensation.

So though I'm bugged by how long it took for them to handle this, and the
lack of visible response for the first several weeks of complaints, I have
to say I'm satisfied with the result.  (Well, assuming the process for
switching back to the $99 plan works as described!)

For those eligible to stay on the $99 plan, you've got a month in which to
take care of it.
