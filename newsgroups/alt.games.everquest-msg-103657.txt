Well, the ATK "stat" and the derived AC "stat" are an attempt by the
user interface to show you how strong your current combination of
stats, skills, gear, and buffs make you in melee.  The actual combat
mechanics are not quite as simple as a comparison between two numbers.
Your displayed AC considers Defense skill, Agility, AC from gear, and
AC from buffs.  But, as with ATK, there are apparently two different
aspects to your defense being shown as a single integrated value:
attack avoidance and damage mitigation.

You can see the dual nature of your AC in action by twinking a L1 with
some armor and then taking him out to his local newbie yard.  You can
easily get an AC of over 200 on this L1, and yet all the L1 mobs will
hit him with very nearly every attack as he has very little ability in
attack avoidance, but the mobs will rarely if ever do more than 1 hit
of damage because they aren't strong enough to overwhelm his armor's
damage mitigation.  Now repeat the experiment with a naked warrior who
displays the same AC as your twink and he will almost never get hit
since his naked AC reflects the attack avoidance from his Defense skill
and Agility, but on those rare occassions that the L1 mobs actually hit
him they will do normal damage because he has no damage mitigation from
armor.

As far as I can tell the ATK and AC benefits from buffs (other than
the indirect bonus from STR buffs) seem to apply to your hidden "to
hit" and "attack avoidance" "stats" respectively, while direct AC
bonuses from armor give you damage mitigation.

Also worth noting is that when the attacker's "to hit" is much better
or worse than the defender's attack avoidance this will also skew the
damage results (i.e. if a L30 Warrior attacks a L15 mob he will get a
lot of high damage results, while if he attacks a L45 mob he will get
mostly low damage results when he does score hits).

Finally, I have no idea whether the AC from non-armor gear (rings,
earrings, weapons, shields) affects avoidance or mitigation, nor for
that matter is it clear whether the very high AC values on magical
armor give you some mix of avoidance and mitigation, nor have I heard
of anybody trying to test this.

So, get your AC up with your gear and enjoy the fact that your SK's
spells help him outdamage those annoying goody-two-shoes Paladins, if
only by a tiny bit.
