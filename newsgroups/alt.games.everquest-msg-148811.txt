i dont know about that tyger from all that my programming friends tell me,
they dont do games cause theyre harder then hell.  and these guys are some
of em doing security systems for big buisnesses, programming assembly lines
and designing for defense dept (actually he didnt say it was harder he said
its a pain in the ass and the bennies arent near as good) just the opinions
ive heard on whether or not game designers could work in other places in
buisness
