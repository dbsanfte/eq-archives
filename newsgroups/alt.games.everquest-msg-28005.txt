Top of the Tower of Frozen Shadow.  You can't actually get to the top
of the tower (that I've found, anyway), but you can get awfully close.
Vertical position on /loc is over 1,000.  I got some lovely
screenshots up there.  The ground starts fading away very close to the
tower.

I also know a spot where, with Levitate, a lot of effort and running
around, you can reach a point where the ground directly below you gets
clipped.

Kithicor.

If you work at it, you can run branch to branch, moving East and
moving up.  You can eventually get so high that you can actually see
the *tops* of the Kith trees.  You also completely lose sight of the
ground below you.


Regarding The Hole.  I did the following with a Level 1 Shadowknight:
Jump in.  Start to Zone.  Disconnect the phone cord.  Wait a minute.
Reconnect.  Log back into the game.  Log back into the character.  You
will take a short (non-damaging) drop and be on the ground in The
Hole.

Unfortunately, I must have startled Master Yael, dropping in like that
unannounced.  I immediately thereafter took my personal record for
damage.  He cast some sort of fire-based damage spell on me and I very
promptly took 20K (20 thousand {20,000}) points of damage.
