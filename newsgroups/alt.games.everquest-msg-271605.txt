That's what I had thought myself, that perhaps D.J. liked being a
melee type class and that's why he picked a warrior, so a necro or
druid might not be his cup of tea for that reason (plus I think he
also said he didn't want an evil character which would rule out the
necro anyway, of course).  And beastlords indeed are great soloers,
and he could play a Barbarian or Vah Shir if he didn't want to be
evil.

How well do monks solo these days?  I would think they'd be easier to
solo with a warrior since they can BW to 70%, then use mend to get
back more HP, plus they can FD if they get in trouble, but then they
also have to watch their weight limit to avoid an AC hit, unlike other
melee type classes.
