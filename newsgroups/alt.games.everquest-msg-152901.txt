This would be interesting, as it would be a simple matter to die down
to 59 (worst hell level in game) and then AA for most of three hours,
and then rez myself back up to low 60.  The only 60 spell I regularly
use is Aego, which has a plenty long duration on it.  This would cost
me 4% of a death in 60, but if it meant double my normal AA progress,
it would be well worth it.
