Sarcastic answer, but he's right :-)

Levelling takes time, and the higher level you are, the longer it will take. If
you fight solo, you will have longer and longer recovery times. If you fight in
a group, you will be getting fewer experience points for each kill. One hour a
night is doable until about 6th or 7th level, but after that you really need
more time to see any improvement. And even then... why should it matter what
level you are? So long as you are having fun....
