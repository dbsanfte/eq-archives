At 8th level, my Erudite Enchanter did the first half of the Stein of
Maggok(sp) quest. This was before PoP, before Luclin. He did it on his
own two feet.

For those of you not familiar with the quest, I started in Erudin
where I picked up a bottle of beer (Erud's Tonic, I believe). From
there, I hopped the boat to South Qeynos, and hoofed it to Surefall
Glade to get a Flask of Nitrates. I took the Nitrates from Surefall to
A'kanon. That's right: From Surefall to A'kanon - foot powered all the
way. Surefall Glade to Qeynos Hills to West Karana to North Karana
(begged a SoW here) to East Karana, up the ramp to Highpass (btw, you
haven't played Everquest 'till you've hiked the ramp from East Karana
to Highpass) to Kithicor. I stopped off in Rivervale / Misty Thicket
to pick up some Honeyjum - another part of the quest. Back to Kithicor
to West Commonlands to East Commonlands to West Freeport to East
Freeport, boat to Ocean of Tears - stopping at Sister Isle to pick up
a Kiola Nut - on to Butcherblock to Greater Faydark to Lesser Faydark
to A'kanon. In A'kanon, turned in the Nitrates for some Regurgitonic.
Gate back to Qeynos and hoof it again to West Karanas to feed the
Regurgitonic to a dog to make him barf up a Koalindl Fish. Then, I
took the whole mess (Erud's Tonic, Kiola Nut, Honeyjum, Koalindl Fish)
back to East Freeport - on foot - to get my Compendium. I waited until
I was 12th level to take the Compendium to Oggok to get my Stein.

Compare that to the Tashania quest (29th level Enchanter Spell).
Starts in Temple of Solusek Ro. From there, you collect coins (ground
spawn) from A'kanon, Kaladim, Erudin, Qeynos, Halas, Oggok, Grobb,
Nariak, Felwith, and Freeport. Combine them in the quest supplied
container and take the result to High Keep, Neriak, Erudin, then,
finally, back to the Temple of Solusek Ro. PoP was out by the time I
did this quest and it took me about 15 minutes. Without PoP, it surely
would have taken hours.
