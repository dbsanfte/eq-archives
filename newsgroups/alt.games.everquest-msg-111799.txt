I believe you can't so it doesn't matter. Once again, its a totally
different character system, its set up totally differently, you have
class paths rather than a path, loot is totally different and decays,
levels possibly go up to 100 = why would they LET you transfer when it
would not be the SAME character anyone and the REASON why they are
building EQ2 is because EQ1 IS NOT upgradeable very much BECAUSE of
the characters and their staticness with the rest of the game engine?

The characters will be totally different = can't happen.
