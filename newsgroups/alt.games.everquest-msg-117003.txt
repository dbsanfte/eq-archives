Soloing, for the most part.  And soloing wasn't always boring ... in fact,
it was very exciting (no one to backstop me, can I really take that forest
giant greenwood at 24, that sort of thing).  At 44, though, it changed.  The
moment I purchased my 44 spells I ported to Surefall, ran to Everfrost, and
root/dotted a few IGs as a kind of rite of passage.  BTW, as an aside,
everyone rants and raves about the loot from IGs ... the first one I dropped
had 31 plat on him, and every one after that had 0 plat, little gold, and no
items.  Maybe I got the destitute ones .....

My druid's life as a hunter boils down to two choices ... root/dotting, or
quadding.  Oh boy, spirocs ... quadding.  Oh boy, frost giants ...
root/dotting.  Oh boy, forest giant hut in FV ... root/dotting at first,
quadding later.  Oh boy, seafuries ...root/dotting.  Get the idea? :-)

Or I could be my guild's porthound.  Whoo hoo ... yea rah.  My guild doesn't
have enough members over 50 to constitue a group, let alone a raid.  And
you're right, I don't have 8+ hours to spend raiding unless I want two upset
kiddos and one ~very~ torqued off wife. :-)

Maybe upper lvl druids are the thing for me.  I had a blast with him in his
20's and 30's.

That may well be another thing you've hit on there.  My goal was to get him
to 200 WIS ... damn the AC, full speed ahead.  Accomplished that at 47.  I
have no real desire to complete the druid epic ... the wep really does
nothing for me, as I haven't meleed a mob in so long I doubt I could swing
my Centi Warhammer, let alone a scimitar.

If I had a nickel for everytime I've come ~this close~ to deleting my SK
over his life, I'd not have to work for a few weeks.  The fact that he's a
SK be damned ... people seem to want cuddle up to an ogre, particularly when
I'm RPing him to the hilt.  Go figure .... :-)

I've been ignoring all of those threads ... as a 38 year old man with two
young sons, I have enough cause for my blood pressure to be eleveated. :-)
