Long memory over the past 7 years.  I usually try and log in a little 
before patch complete time, trying to get lucky.  Sometimes I get  in, 
which means early.  Often I can't get in, sometimes not for hours.  If 
you're claiming that this 75% chance of not being precisely on schedule 
has changed substantially and recently, well I'd have to see 
documentation to prove that, but if you can show it to me, I'll agree 
that I'm mistaken, that this particular solution would work now, 
although it hasn't in the past.

BUT the fact that the current patch is running over doesn't make a 
strong arguement in your favor.

Often.  Unless you can prove otherwise.  I'll set a number for you, if 
patches have been complete within 10 minutes of the posted estimate less 
than 33% of the time in the past two years, I'll withdraw my "often".

For "usually" to be wrong, I'd accept any figure less than 50% of the 
time, however, I didn't go with that standard (although I strongly 
suspect that it would have been accurate)

No, its not.  Beating my head against the wall would be trying to change 
something that in fact can't be changed.  Venting is letting off steam 
so the boiler doesn't explode.

Venting is healthy, beating your head against a wall is damaging.

My mistake, I thought you were trying to get somewhere.  Venting, I can 
get behind that, even if its venting about venting... although I claim 
moral superiority in that I'm venting about actual problems, which 
venting about venting is a logical inconsitency.  Which is OK, after 
all, a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.

Yes and no, I'm screaming into the wind, it doesn't really matter to me 
who can and can't see it... setting it down and releasing it is 
sufficient for my purposes.  I'll admit though, commiseration would be a 
bonus, as would constructive disagreement (which I thought you were 
attempting); show me a web page, for example, where the "real" 
information is posted, or some other viable workaround for the borked 
process I go thru now, I'd rather not have a complaint to vent about.

The official boards are another matter entirely, not that there's 
anything wrong with thread drift into that... but my point here is that 
I'm not trying to affect change, and don't have the illusion that 
anything I say here is likely to do so.

The Sony boards are crap.  They are censored, and not by some nuetral 
agency, but by the very company we're commenting on.  There may be 
useful information posted in there, but the administration is immoral, 
objectionable, degrading, un-american... I'm not getting the exact 
pejorative to come up, perhaps I'll think of it later.  I'll put it this 
way, I don't post on or read boards run by people who don't agree with 
me about what Freedom means.

I'll say it again, "this is Liberty Hall, we can spit on the floor and 
call the cat a bastard."  Thats what America was founded on, and I 
believe in those principles, not just for fellow americans, but, as you 
might have read "all men".

Even SOE customers.

Occaisionally in the status, I don't think I'll give you "often", which 
I'll define here as "more than 33% of the time, within 10 minutes"

As an example, today at 3:39 EST, 39 minutes post estimated completion 
time, we still see

Scheduled EverQuest Server Maintenance - 12/05/2006 4:00am
Downtime Update

All EverQuest servers will be coming down at 4:00 AM PST (-8 UTC) on 
Tuesday 12/05/2006 for a game update. Estimated downtime is 8 hours.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Oh, and yes, it still says "will be", which is more in the way of a pet 
peeve than an actual complaint

I'm ok with that, I just misunderstood your intentions.

Yeah, I play only about 7 months a year, being on the road and out of 
contact the rest of the time, and for a couple of the months I do play, 
I'm working during patch hours.  So its quite possible I've just missed 
seeing this happen... it sure LOOKED like an improvement.  Silly me, 
thinking they might have fixed something.

Well I was going to Vote you, since SOE had improved something, and I'd 
noted and posted about it.  But now we're even, since SOE hadn't 
improved after all, and I was wrong about them doing so...wait, no, now 
you're ahead since you informed me about my being wrong, and they are 
still... wrong.

Too bad there's no prize.
