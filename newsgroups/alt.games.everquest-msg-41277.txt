Nice to branch out to something a little less depressing.

I like the way you put "other than the indigs" in brackets. So, when you are
talking about the history of Australia, you are talking about the last 200
years as the only relevant ones. It is estimated the "indigs" were here for
between 40-60,000 years beforehand. Never mind, let us dismiss those 40,000
years and press on.

Now, just because convicts were transported here by the British, does not
not mean the whole continent was intended to be used as a prison colony.
Otherwise, the same could be said for America;

Go here

and read this;
"The Trans-Atlantic Market for British Convict Labour (1767-1775)

Approximately 50,000 British convicts were sentenced to servitude and
forcibly transported to America between 1718-75."
