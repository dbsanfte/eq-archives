  Mind quoting the relevant section(s)?  I haven't even tried RvR yet, but
the PvE portion has been slightly less annoying than EQ for me.  I'm not
sure it's necessarily *fun*, mind you, as the leveling treadmill is
essentially the same, but at least the downtime is less, and you can
effectively solo if you feel like it.
  However, I did play the Mythic game Spellbinder, which was basically
Unreal Tournament with crappy graphics, all spellcasters and character
advancement.  It was pretty fun, though, and since it appears some of DAoC
is cribbed from Spellbinder, I expect RvR will be ok too.  PvP death is
largely without penalty (no item loss, no xp loss), and it's consensual, as
it's area-based, so the comments about it being "another UO" are not quite
right.
  Anyway, I'm sticking with both for now, although it remains to be seen if
DAoC will be worth 12.95 a month.  I was about to cancel my EQ account,
actually, but that was the day they introduced the "play as a monster" thing
on Test, which was amusing enough to rekindle some interest.
