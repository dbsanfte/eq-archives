You must have worked up a pretty bad reputation for yourself if you can't
find a group as a 65 cleric.  Hell, I got a group yesterday with a 29
chanter and I didn't even have my LFG on...  Basically, in the past year or
year and a half I've started a necro, pally, bard, chanter, wiz, mage,
rogue, and monk and have been able to find groups for them all in cb, pc,
nl, ms, dsp, cc, gunthak, dulak, the planes, ldons, etc.  And most of them
aren't even guilded.

Howldog, you probably shouldn't listen to people like this.  I've got 8
characters who are all different levels and are spread over 3 different
servers and I have never had trouble finding a group.  I've started several
melees when I was either new to the server or poorer than dirt and I still
managed to get them armored up and get them some decent weapons.  Don't
worry about casters either.  Sure, they need new spells every 4 levels, but
they don't cost much and you should be able to make enough money from
whatever you happen to be looting at your level.

While I disagree with most of what he said, it is true that this is not a
solo-friendly game.  You will need to group, but as I've said grouping is
not a hard thing to do (unless you get yourself a bad reputation.  I know a
few people who no one will group with anymore because they are either
annoying or really bad at playing their class, but I won't mention any names
such as Cenlen).  If you are going to want to solo, there are classes that
can solo all the way up to 70, but I find soloing to be a little slow and
boring for my taste.
