I don't know where this rumor keeps coming from.

I have imported any number of items from Velious to
the world, given some to guildmates and sold others;
never have I had a single person complain that they
did not work for them, other than a level 12 who
said that his velium scmitar was not proc'ing.

I"m still looking for a definative answer on when
they -do- proc, but I can state for certain that
a coldain velium dagger procs a 12DD in the
hands of a level45 ranger who does not own
velious... as he was my original tester for the
very first velium weapon I imported.
