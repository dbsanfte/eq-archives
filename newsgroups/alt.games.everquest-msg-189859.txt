Heh.  Got a good laugh out of this.  Thanks.

Bards tank worse than rangers, maybe slightly better than rogues.  You
can heal, but at an astoundingly slow rate.  So as long as you can put
battles on pause for 5 minutes while the MT sits down and you play your
song, you guys make _great_ healers!

You guys are VERY good for very short term buffs, but you can't do huge
healing or damage all at once and your stuff doesn't last for longer than
a few minutes at best after you've switched songs.

That said, one of my favorite people to have around is a good bard.  You
didn't even mention a couple of the things they're incredibly good at:
buffs (melee, haste, resists) and crowd control.  Not to mention selo's
rocks my world.  I do have a screenshot of a lvl 62 Bard asking me for
SoW though *grin*.

PS: stfu and play the heart song, damnit.

What you said may be true for a high level bard but in the below 30's what I
said is quite applicable.
This was a newbie question thread after all.
True our heal is more like a group regen, but it works well and is quite
often underestimate by others.

Um, Quite agree with you though......  NO IDEA why a level 62 bard would
want SoW unless he was too busy twisting other songs to put Selo's into
it.....
