LOL!!!
I had three alts; warrior, sk and magician. My warrior and SK get
armor with some thought behind it and the occasional weapon upgrade,
and the magician gets haphazard twinking when I loot something she can
use or come across something really cheap (I once paid 800 for an
advisor robe and dustscryer's ball, which is the only time I have ever
bought her something expensive - and I kinda regret it now, since I
prefer the way she looks in gossimer or leather and haven't even begun
to consider wearing the advisor robe :) )
A couple days ago, I made myself a high elf cleric (she'll learn
smithing one day). I've dressed her up in the spare bits and pieces
from my other three alts and a couple pieces my main has had in bank
forever.  She has a shield, a couple blunt weapons and full visible
armor (mostly leather (black) with a black plate bp) except on her
head, and looks a damned cool :)
Um, anyway, sometimes it's just more fun to chuck a spare piece of
gear on an alt who could use it than it is to spend hours trying to
sell it to someone else.
