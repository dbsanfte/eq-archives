Significant update. The faction system that was recently added will bring 
with it something that's been conspicuously missing from combat: social 
aggro. This changes the current combat dynamic quite a bit as you will no 
longer be able to rely on the highlighted group names as the minimum pull. 
You will still have to fight the entire group that is identified, but if 
they are surrounded by faction friendly mobs you will also risk bringing 
them with the pull. A dev post this afternoon mentioned that NPCs are 
getting social flags now and that the system will be complete in the next 
couple of days.

So, looks like pulling tactics are going to be a factor after all.
