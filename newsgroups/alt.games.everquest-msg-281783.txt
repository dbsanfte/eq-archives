Seriously, that decision by Sony was ridiculous.  Utterly, obscenely,
insane.  So far I haven't seen the worst thing about it even mentioned.

What if somebody else does it too?

How many performance sapping, hard drive space consuming, memory eating
pieces of useless code am I going to have to go through to get to my
unprotected CD of pictures from the last family picnic?

What are the chances that the driver installed by Sony doesn't conflict with
the drivers installed by Atlantic, Columbia, Motown, and...  and Time Life
Books, and Encyclopedia Brittannica (you know it wouldn't be limited to
music CDs), and...  Fox and MGM (it's bound to be able to be used for DVDs
too).

I honestly think it should be prosecuted by whoever would do such a thing
(state attorney generals perhaps) under anti-hacking laws.
