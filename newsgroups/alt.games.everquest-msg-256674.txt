Aha, no, he's selfishly realized that the epic is a powerful tool in any 
hands, and is willing to lie cheat and steal his way into Tunare's good 
graces by any means necessary to get it... and doubtless will shortly 
thereafter be seen in POG thumbing his nose at the Lady as he helps 
slaughter her.

I'm suggesting that a Character is different from a class, and that it 
doesnt' have to involve playing a stereotypical member of that class in 
order to be legitimate role playing.  Playing Against Type is one way 
I've heard the idea described.

I can't say for sure that you aren't right, mind you, I'm just trying to 
suggest that there certainly are character choices you can make that 
might look a lot like those made by someone who is (like 99% of the 
players in the game) completely ignoring character issues in favor of 
just going for all the power they can, any way they feel like.

While a character who's gone over to the good side but who switches back 
to evil, performing vile and despicable acts in order to gain the favor 
of an evil god, certainly seems to fit your complaint, I don't see how 
an good person gone evil can be banned from pretending to good, even if 
it does involve killing other evil people to "prove" it... this is the 
asymmetrical nature of good and evil at work; evil can pretend to good 
much better than good pretends to evil, but at the same time good is 
rarely betrayed by good, while evil betrays evil at the drop off a hat.

I too doubt it, but I'm attempting to give him the benefit of the doubt, 
he has yet to actually say anything that will pin him down as betraying 
the practices and ethics of an evil organization.

Personally, I've found that adhering to personal character ethics, even 
ones I've chosen myself, is the path of the outcast in EQ, or at least 
it once was; I ended up abandoning a couple characters because we got to 
a point where I was supposed to switch from coldain faction and COV 
faction to killing COV dragons and Coldain plus the Dain, and liking 
giants.  I just wouldn't do it, and ended up making a second character 
and leveling him up in order to rejoin the guild as a giant friend... by 
which point they were doing something which -that- character refused to 
do (I forget what).

Perhaps I could go back to those characters now and skip over the SOV 
content by going directly on into POP/GOD stuff, but I just feel burned 
over the very nature of the three major SOV factions for anyone playing 
someone who doesn't betray his allies.
