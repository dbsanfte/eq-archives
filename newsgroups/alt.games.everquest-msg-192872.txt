You lose the mouse??? THat happened to me when they added windowed mode
for the login section.....Ive not tried and alt shift R routine to give me
a mouse back, but rather with my Zone Alarm (freebie version) simplyuse
ALT-(whatever the underlined letter is on the dialogue box you want) to
click the bits (in my case Alt-R to tick the check box for yes always
doing this in the future and Alt-Y for clicking YES).
