Your original post was Friday at 2pm.  By my clock, it's been 74 hours.  
-Never- is significantly longer than 74 hours.  People do other things, 
you know, besides sitting here thinking up clever replies to your posts.  
For myself, in that time, I've been to 3 rehearsals, remodelled a webpage,  
and spent a nice evening at a pub.  If it really warrants a reply, I'm 
sure Ben will be along in a bit to get to it.  Oh look, there he is...

}I didn't accuse them of not listening.  I asked if they did.  I never got a
}reply from them.  The reply I did get accused me of accusing them of not
}listening when I clearly asked if they did (the words were in the form of a
}question, even ending with a "?").

Are you still beating your wife?

It's just a question, see?  It even has a '?' at the end.
