I know that you can use commands such as /book and /sit, but is there a
command that will do any of the following?

1. Remove a spell from a slot

2. Add a spell to a slot

It seems that this would be possible looking at all of the macros that
people are setting up for casting and auctioning.  This would be very handy
to set up in order to swap some spells in and out of the active spells list.

If not, well then that is more clicking away to add to the carpal tunnel :)

Thanks in advance.

Brian
