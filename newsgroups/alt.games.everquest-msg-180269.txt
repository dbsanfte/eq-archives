There are two 10-slot kits available in Kaladim I believe.  I'm not
sure if they will hand the kits out if you aren't the right race, but
they will give them to you regardless of your class.

Qeynos has a "tax collection" quest for which you get a 10-slot box
that hold small items, perfect for research items, spell scrolls, and
gems.  

If you can tailor, combine a thick grizly bear skin and a silk cord in
a sewing kit to make a 10-slot potion bag.
