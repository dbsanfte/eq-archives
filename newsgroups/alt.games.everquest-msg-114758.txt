To make it a bit more difficult, you will not get a message on a failed
attempt telling you that it was trivial.  You will only get a message
telling you that it is trivial on a successful attempt.  OTOH, once it is
trivial, your success rate is fairly high, so it should not take too many
attempts to find out.  Another solution is to just get the trivial
information off the web, Lokari has an excellent tailoring site at
www.lokari.net, as does www.eqtraders.com.
