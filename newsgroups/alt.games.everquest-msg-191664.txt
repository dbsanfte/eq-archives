I know this isn't going to help, but you will not be able to play EQ with
that card until you find drivers for it that support at least DX8.  I did
find something that said open dxdiag disable direct3d and then enable it
again.  Then run the test to see if you get it to run the DX8 and DX9 test.
See if EQ works after doing this.
