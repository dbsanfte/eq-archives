Well this is where you ALL get it wrong...


I managed to break a CD just the other day, Operation Flashpoint in a DVD
style case where the central "gripping" spindle thingie was a little TOO
resiliant for the CD.

Lazy old me took the cd out of the case without pressing on the centre, i.e
by just pulling the top - and the CD split (I cracked fully all the way
across the radius on one side. I didnt even pull it that hard either.

So, it can be done - and quite easily as well.....
