Friend of mine has to be careful about which first-person games he plays
because the geometry makes him sick sometimes.  Doom was ok (way back then),
but others make himm ill after 15-20mins.

Perhaps the geometry has had a fundamental change in EQ (Engine change,
Luclin maybe?) and you suffer from the same motion-sickness he  has?

bummer :(
