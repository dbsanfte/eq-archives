So, out of curiosity, I did a search on Lucy, and, only weapon that a 
level 21 BL could wield in one hand that it came up with was Soul 
Devourer, a 100dmg/10dly NO RENT one hand slash weapon.  Next closest was 
a 1hb, 30dmg/40dly, -1 damage bonus at level 21.  So, having a really 
tough time seeing how a level 21 BL was hitting regularly for 80.  I 
could see it on max hits, but not normal hits.
