Spent the last 5 hours camping for Large Yellowjackets in Misty Thicket (if
you can call it camping...  I had friendly druids tracking them all over the
place, and only sat at the place I knew they spawned, near the hill), so I
could get the two tergites for my Stoutdeacon Greaves.  Killed up to 6 of
the blasted things in a row, no tergites.  I was close to breaking down and
smashing something.

And there are people out there who do this for 30 hours on VS, and lord only
knows how long Ragefire?  Suddenly I doubt I'll ever have the patience for
the high-end game...

Anyone have any advice for dealing with the mind-numbing stress of camping a
mob?  'cuz I'm gonna have to start right back up tomorrow...
