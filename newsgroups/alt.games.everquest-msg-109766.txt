  In my experience, names are available as soon as you delete the character.
Recently I meant to create a wood elven bard, but I accidentally created a
wood elven rogue. :P  A couple minutes into the game I realized my mistake,
camped out, and deleted the character.  Took me about 30 seconds to recreate
the character, and the name was accepted immediately.

  I've also heard a GM say in chat that usually names are available as soon
as you delete a character with that name.  There may be a slight delay
before the purge, but I don't think it's more than 15 minutes.
