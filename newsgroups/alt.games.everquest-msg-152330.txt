Hey, Ben. Can you help out some of the backwoods folks on a less
developed server for a minute? (I sort of already said I was going to
come ask you for some straight dope on a question, not to put you on the
spot or anything. /grin )

There's a thread on our server boards right now regarding the sleeper.
It started out as a "what happens after PoP release to ST" sort of
thing, but devolved into a lot of speculation about "killing the
sleeper" etc. etc. with what looked to be blatant misinformation.  Of
course, this is Xev, and nobody there's ever seen the sleeper awake,
(still snoozing) and tons of guesswork.

Some of these include people stating that Sleeper stays in ST after
awakening, you can take multiple tries at killing him, that he can't
appear in any zone but ST even when awakened, all sorts of stuff. Being
the only person I know how to personally contact who's actually seen the
bastard, and in fact fought him, I figured you'd be a good "from the
horse's mouth" sourse of info.

You may have to waste a moment registering for the stupid YaBB board we
use, but I'd appreciate it. Be nice to see straight answers, and I'd be
very grateful for your time in educating the "backwater hicks".
