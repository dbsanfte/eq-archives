SOE nerfed twinking.  Now if you equip your character with anything the game
doesn't consider "realistic" for your level, you don't get any experience
unless you swim to the middle of OOT, go to the bottom, bind yourself, sit
down, and walk away from your keyboard for 6 hours.  When you get back
you'll see a major change in your exp bar.

Well, actually I'm not sure if you can even bind yourself underwater, or if
you lose exp when you drown.  Doesn't matter.  You should try it anyway,
then come back and post about it.
