A close second is sound drivers.  Try creating a junk file
in your Everquest directory named "nosound.txt", then run
Everquest (whenever EQ detects that file being present, it
skips doing any sound generation in the game).

If that magically cures the crashes, time to upgrade the
sound driver.  Or just live without sound, but personally
I can't stand playing without sound on.

Don't forget to erase the nosound.txt file when you want
to re-enable sound or try out your new sound driver, if
that's the problem.
