Hint: PvP games aren't all that popular. What was the #1 complaint people
had about UO? PKs. What are the least populated EQ/AC servers? PvP ones.

I don't count Counterstrike, Starcraft, Unreal, or basically any non-RPG
game for judging popularity, because the nature of the games is completely
different.

The losers having less fun than the winners != the winners having fun.
