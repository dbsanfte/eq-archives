Sleeper's Tomb is the holy grail. Intended to keep the uber-uber-guilds
happy. As long as the sleeper hasn't been slain there is still an objective
in the game to be made. I think that if some guild finally defeats it, there
will probably be an even worse end-boss.
Because, face it, the Sleeper is the final boss, the Alpha Centauri in
Civilization, the Diablo in Diablo (1 and 2 :), the Olympic medal in sports,
etc. You can play on, but you've made the ultimate target in the game.

Kilmir, dreaming of a raid on that place.
