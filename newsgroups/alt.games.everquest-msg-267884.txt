True.
However I find that turning the texture resolution way up kills 
performance on my 128M FX5900 card but doesn't make nearly as much 
difference on my 256MB Radeon mobility 9800.

I know the 9800 mobility is faster but turning up the texture resolution 
makes much less *difference* on this card which I imagine is mostly due 
to it having enough texture memory to hold the textures...
