Clerics sacrifice a lot to be the best at healing... solo ability, utility,
and damage, to name the most important.

Druids sacrifice some groupability to be great soloists. Why should they get
to be excellent in groups and solo when Clerics cannot get the same
convenience? Playing a Druid is about as close to playing in God Mode in EQ.

Until Clerics are tolerable soloists, Druids are over-powered in comparison.
(At least with the current spell sets)

Too bad I'm not a Cleric, huh? This doesn't exactly effect me, but it is
wrong that Clerics have to get the shaft over this.

In exp groups, damage stacks - healing doesn't.

The least you could do is lay some newspaper down. Now who is the loser that
has to clean the blood up?

A common myth is that Clerics always have groups... heh, unfortunately for
Clerics that is simply not true. Most Clerics spend hours at a time LFG
while other classes at least have the choice to solo adequately. Not all
Clerics are 56+ so the gimp melee isn't exactly an option.

To tell the truth, Aegolism isn't all it's cracked up to be. At 54, Clerics
can pretty much cast the buffs that make up Aegolism - it just takes more
buff slots and doesn't last quite as long.

Paladins can cast Symbol of Naltron and Resurrection, which is fine, but if
you have a high level Paladin and Druid in the group, you pretty much have
Cleric security while adding more damage and value to the group.

Or if you really must have Aegolism and 96% rezzes just bug that level 60
Cleric LFG at the zone line... the sad thing is, I see that all the time on
my server.
