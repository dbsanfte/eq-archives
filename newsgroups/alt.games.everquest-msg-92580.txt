Wow, talk about medication.  I asked a simple question and you went off and
made it sound like an attack.  Whatever.

I'll rephrase:  the original poster mentioned poor customer service.  Are
you supporting his allegations that HE received poor service or are you
going off-topic by making statements to the affect that some people get poor
service?  Being off-topic isn't a crime, I was asking if you knew something
about the treatment he received, or if I could simply disregard your post.

As to accusations and allegations I've made about you, I have no idea what
you're talking about.  If you'd refresh my mind I'll address them.
