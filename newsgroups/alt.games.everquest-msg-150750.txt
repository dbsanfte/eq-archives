In article <amv4cv$k60$1@news.hccnet.nl>, r.hoogenboom@hccnet.nl says...

But a druid has to cast snare 4 times, lets go through this scenario
(1) Druid casts snare on first mob, then waits 4 seconds for the recast 
whilst mob is wandering towards you.
(2) Druid casts on 2nd mob then waits 4 secs for recast, 1st mob 
advances even nearer, you move back to counter
(3) Druid casts on 3rd mob then waits 4 secs for recast,1st and 2nd mobs 
move nearer, you move back to counter
(4) Druid casts on 4th mob then waits 4 secs for recast,1st,2nd and 3rd 
mobs move closer, you move back to counter

Now at this stage its around 16 seconds since you cast on the first mob
That gives you 1 minute 14 seconds before you snare runs out on the 
first mob and you need to recast it
But which of the 4 needs to be targetted for the recast? they all look 
the same. Then 4 seconds after the first you have to do the second and 
so on
Result dead druid for taking on more than he can handle when the snares 
start breaking and he cant put them back quick enough

I realise ensnare lasts 9-10 mins so this no longer becomes an issue but 
prior to that snare isnt just gonna cut it for quad kiting
