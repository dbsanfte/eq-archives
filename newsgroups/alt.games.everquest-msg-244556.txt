You're posting this the day after a patch day. On patch day, you can 
expect all the raiding guilds to be on standby, if not actively raiding, 
to move on targets of opportunity as they pop.  If the person is in a 
raiding guild, they should definitely either not take an adventure when 
they are on holding status, or should at least make it VERY clear to 
their adventure group that it's possible that they might have to leave 
on short notice.

But you have a right to be disgruntled that the person didn't warn you 
ahead of time, I agree.

Exactly the opposite. They should make it clear that members should 
balance their time so as to not put them at risk of screwing over others 
in pick-up groups as much as possible, but that the guild comes first.

You get caught doing that in our guild (and the majority of raiding 
guiilds, I'm positive) and you'll find yourself untagged in short order.
