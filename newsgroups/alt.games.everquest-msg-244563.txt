Monks FD.  And hit things.

Hell, necros got all that, not to mention shadowknights and bards.

What makes a monk unique?  I feel some deja vu since I think this is where
this thread started from...  Monks used to be unique in that they could FD
on-the-fly.  Now bards can do that...  even better.  That was it.  Other
than FD, monks were a decent melee class, able to tank reasonably well and
put out good damage.  Monks have since been passed in the damage ranking by
quite a few, and passed in the tanking ranking by damn near everybody.  :)
