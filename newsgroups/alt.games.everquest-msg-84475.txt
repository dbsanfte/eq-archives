At these levels, the con of the mob makes zero difference to chances of
success.  The statue would destroy the Guardian in seconds, even tho it cons
higher.....

Statue hits for over 1k, hits very fast, and has several hundred thousand
hitpoints (he is slowable though)

If you can't kill Derakor the Vindicator, don't plan on taking the Statue
down (besides, Vindi guards the way to the statue)

When your monks have more experience pulling prots (ie can single pull 1
from the 3 in the doorway in a timely fashion by themself) they may be in a
position to try and pull Vindi, before then though and they are never going
to split Vindi from his guards (2 level 60 temple guards)

Do you guys try the clerics and (minds gone blank atm) in the 2 rooms either
side of the 3 prots inside?   They are a better challenge while a guild gets
used to higher level kael raids
