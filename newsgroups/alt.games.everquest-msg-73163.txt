Recently I got a larger HD and I moved my two smaller drives to the one
larger one. The second drive had EQ on it and it was drive E:\ so after I
moved everything from E: over I went to the registry, did search on E:\ and
EverQuest and Luclin and everything else I could think of and changed the
drive letter to C:\. The game started dropping me to desktop for no apparent
reason, sometimes when I zone it dropped me, sometimes just sitting around
doing nothing BAM, I get dropped to desktop. So I re-installed EQ since when
I tried to re-install Luclin it insisted that the game was still on E:\.

Loaded all 5 disks, downloaded all the patches over night (28.8 connection),
game worked great for a while but now it's doing the same thing it was doing
before. Sometimes I get dropped to desktop just logging in, and it's really
annoying. Anyone know what the problem might be, or know anything I can do
to fix this problem?
