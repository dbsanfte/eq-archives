Yep that is the reality it just wasn't the scenario given.
If you'd said "I want to transfer a character from someone elses, unused,
account to my own but Verant won't let me" Then there'd be no arguement,
we'd have all replied, them's the breaks. Those guidlines are there to
disuade from the trade of characters/accounts and cut down on the grief that
heads Verants CS department (or whoever it is who answers the phones) when
one of these deals turns sour.

Account C is there because you should have access to Person A's details, so
much so that you can create an account that would meet the criteria set by
VI to allow the transfer to go ahead. Had you not mentioned sisters,
brothers and selling of accounts none of this thread would have happened.
We all know what the guidelines are for Character Transfers and Name Changes
we also know there are sometimes ways around them, especially if the
original owner is a Friend or relative.
