Her previous cyber lover, some Dark Elf Cleric, had left the game.  There
was an evening I remember where she made it a point to tell me he had come
back, and that he was in the same zone we were in.  That's when I asked her
what his name was, and she told me.  I had the opportunity RIGHT THERE to
ask him about her, and I never cared to.  I asked her if he was bothering
her.  She told me no, and then inserted something like, "He probably has
another woman following him around".  I had no clue what the frickafrack she
was talking about, so I asked we continue to our target zone.

No, I did not.  I was upset because when I tried to be the "friend" we
mutually decided we should be for one another, I realized that she didn't
want me as a friend.  Friends chat with each other in the game on occasion.
Friends don't avoid each other's tells, and use lame excuses, and I'm
talking about sending the same question 3 or 4 times and getting no response
or a long, lame excuse instead of just answering the question with a short
answer.  And this was the last straw...I had logged in one night, early
February, and was trying to plan what to do in the game for the next few
hours.  I shot her a tell and asked her what was up.  I got the
sec....sec...sec...busy atm...sec...usual replies and then finally, she told
me she was doing an LDoN adventure.  Again, keep in mind this was coming
from a woman who, months earlier, had no problem reading and responding to
my tells and grouping at the same time.  She told me she was grouping with a
bunch of strangers, that she had formed the group herself.  I told her I was
proud of her for taking the leadership role, and we joked back and forth,
and things actually seemed to be going ok.  A few mins of conversation and I
told her I was going afk and asked if she wanted to group with me after her
current LDoN.  She said sure!, which character you wanna play with?  I said
any of them, I don't care.  I came back from afk, was eating while she
finished the adventure.  A few mins. later I asked which character should I
bring in to play with her, and I got something like this, "I'm getting c3ed
atm and I'm going to go again with this group."  THAT is the infuriating
quality I'm talking about.  Why not just tell me up front, why play the
games?  And why not send me a tell and tell me, instead of have me guessing
WTF was up
with her plans?.  I had to always come asking her.  Are we still on?  Are
you on drugs?
Did you change your mind or something?
She didn't give a simple reason, such as she had changed her mind.
Instead she told me that she thought I was just joking about grouping with
her.  WTF?   That's when I told her that I was done with the gameplaying and
all the other crap, and that I was going to play with people who actually
cared about me in some way or another.  I received the response, "ok", and
that was it.

If you want a guy to get lost in EQ ladies, just SAY SO.

I believe he may have been surprised, but not outraged.  I didn't get the
impression he was the kind of guy to file for divorce because his wife was
cyber whoring with men in EQ.  I did, however, get the impression he was a
much nicer guy than she described him to be to me, and he needed to realize,
whether he cared or not, that his wife was doing what she was doing.  It is
then, of course, up to him to take it how he does, either with concern or
with nonchalance.

Yuppers, and better yet...I can avoid married women both in future online
games and in real life.  /grin
