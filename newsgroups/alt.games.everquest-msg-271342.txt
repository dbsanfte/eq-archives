You will find that even fully buffed with the best buffs you can get, 
eventually, your warrior will not be able to solo effectively.  That is 
just the reality of a warrior.  If you want to be sure that you can solo 
effectively right up to level 70, then you should consider a different 
class.  A beastlord is an excellent choice for that.

I certainly won't dispute that, just give you the warning above, that, 
eventually, you will reach a level where you just can't do it anymore in 
any effective manner.  That is just the reality of playing a warrior.  It 
applies even more so to someone who is not dressed in the best raid gear 
they can get.
