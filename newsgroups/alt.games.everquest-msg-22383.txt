The parser is an amazing program and I'm grateful that this most Gnomish of
Gnomes has made it available to the rest of us at such a reasonable price!

I will upgrade immediately.

A feature I would like to see--being that I'm a Mage that solos with my Pet
most of the time--is a read-out of my Pet...her damage done, taken, spells,
etc.

Thanks, Joe
