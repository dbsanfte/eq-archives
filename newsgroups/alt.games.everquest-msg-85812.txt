Here's how I view spoiler sites:  They are like 1) hanging out at the
taverns of Norrath between your adventuring, hearing word-of-mouth from
other adventurers what they've discovered, and 2) like consulting the wise
Sages to see what they know about the local lore and legends.

The spoiler sites make up for the fact that these information sources are
not available in the game, and would be available if Norrath were a 'real
place.'
