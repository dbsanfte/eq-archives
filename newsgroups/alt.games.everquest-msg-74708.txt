Can't speak for Gix, I can gank him silly now at 38.  But Dragoon Zytl is a
fucking bastard.

Back at 32 or so, I was buffing my friends newbie alt monk, and sat down
near the inn to med, and Zytl comes up and hits me with his sword, I try to
snare, resist, try again, resist, shout "Zytl train", run off in what I
think is the EC zone direction, GET FUCKING SNARED, run around like a
chicken with my head cut off dotted snared and getting beat on, end up at
the druid ring /y spamming, die, come back to WC ring via self port in time
to see him killing the last of the buff beggars that hang out at the druid
ring (haha) and a pile of corpses.  I drag my corpse off to kithicor to loot
it.  God I hate that bastard, I spent about an hour with a melee lizard a
week or two later hunting him and gix down.
