Hi All

Some info on the XP Potion Treasure Hunt.  Anything with a question
mark is not known for sure, but I was merely piecing together /ooc and
guild chat where people were linking the items.  I admit I hadn't a
clue on what most of these were! Hope it helps a bit, and forgive me
if anything proves incorrect.  

The various Hunt Items are No-Drop, naturally.Someone linked the
potion just as I was logging out, but in the few seconds I saw it I
noticed the duration was 15 minutes (not 30, as patch said, but what
the heck, I'm not complaining) but it was NOT Lore, so you could grab
2 or 3 of each item and just see the NPC for the bag after you
collected the stuff  :))  I can't recall noting if said potion was
No-Drop, but I assume it will be.
