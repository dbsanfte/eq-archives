That's nothing.  In another MMORPG I play, when you reach level 50, you are
allowed to start new characters at level 20.  I was in a lowbie dungeon
(~10-20) with my level 50 character, showing a friend who was playing a
level 15 around.  I got a tell from someone who had just died asking me if I
could go create a Cleric, /level to 20, and come to the dungeon to res him!

Even worse, all a res would do in that game is save him a few silver at an
NPC healer to buy back the CON points you lose for an unresed death, plus
the travel time to run back to the dungeon.  Since his travel time would be
no more than the travel time it would have taken for me to get a Cleric
there, he would actually have lost time, so all he would have really saved
was a few silver--at his level no more than what he could pick up in 10
minutes of killing easy mobs for loot.
