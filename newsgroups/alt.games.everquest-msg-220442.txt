I dunno about CT, but he's correct about LDoN.  Every named I've
ever fought in a L55 mission Enraged, and all mobs in those missions
except assassination targets (L56) are under L55.  The minor named
hit for like 20 - 200 and are not gonna kill you if you're using a
2-hander, but might drop a half-dead dual-wielder.  The asassination
targets will hit hard enough (over 200) and often enough to kill a
hasted dual-wielding Ranger almost as fast as a pet though (seen it
happen), but again probably not gonna drop someone using a 2-hander
unless they're half-dead already.
