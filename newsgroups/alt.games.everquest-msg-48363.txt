One of the rare times an assumption won't make an "ass" out of you.

Any broadband option at all, even ISDN, is superior to satellite. Sat is
mediocre download rates (400kbps last time I looked) and you're -still-
saddled with a dial-up because satellite is one way. You have to use the
dial-up connection for your uplink which means that although you would be
able to see things "pop" quicker on the screen, you'd still be hampered by
your uplink lag.

Get cable, ISDN, DSL - anything at all. Satellite simply is NOT worth
it. (For gaming. If you were a casual internet user the situation is not
the same)
