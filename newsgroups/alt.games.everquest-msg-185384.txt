then it clearly wasn't my night.

Earlier, I was playing in Dreadlands... the server (The Rathe) crashed at
least three times while I was online... It would dump about 3/4 of the
players in the zone - apparently happening all over the world too.

Here's me, lvl 35, low level for the zone, running to join a group - when I
arrived, the entire party is sitting there with 'LD'  floating above their
heads..  later, with another group, we're fighting (what to me was) a yellow
mob and whack - we both go LD, leaving our poor cleric caught with his pants
down.

He claims we continued to fight the thing till it died (no apparent XP gain
tho! G!) and then popped outta existence.  handy, eh?  G!
