Check out www.graffe.com, a resource for wizard stuff.  You can also see
http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/ and view equipment that other players
have. For example, my charcter is at
http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=51869.


As for equipment, have you looked into the staff of the wheel quest, the
staff is +10 int.
You should beable to fight in DT in lowerguk, and get a runed crowl (+9
int).

The great owoomp in Timourus deep drops +5int earings and +3int face item.

If you want to have something made, have a jewler cook up a velium saphire
neclace, +8int +8str.
