<---not a practice catholic...but if memory serves me right...they old
testament is considered done away with, as christ brought a new law.
Therefore the rules and prescribed methods of dealing with things is not
still followed.  In fact most "modern" day christians believe that half of
deut and numbers etc. were not "god" inspired holy writ but rules set up by
the priest class to enforce their political power.
