They did this last year. So I guess we can look forward to Werewolves
flooding WC, uber-guilds flooding into WC, followed by the zone
crashing. Last years Halloween made me pine for the undead invasion of
Qeynos Hills from two years ago. I had a great time with that one,
though I think I was about the only one in this newsgroup. Work
Halloween night so I guess I'll miss whatever they do, but as last
years was weak, I suspect other then small group events, nothing will
happen.

<hint Verant> Maybe pick an under utilize zone, have some sort of
undead or "monster" invasion. People won't bitch much about "being"
cut off from other zones and allow for something "seasonal" for most
levels then the usual lawn trash and static MoB spawn of the zone.
