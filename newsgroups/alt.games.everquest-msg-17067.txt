Ranger is prob using a dmg shield which enhances aggro, and/or using the
taunt button. Rangers low AC means they begin to take severe beating at
higher levels and your friend is making that discovery. Against hard hitting
mobs I suggest your ranger is told not to taunt and to not use a dmg shield.
Rangers can level fast and solo pretty well at lower levels, but because
they deal out a lot of dmg and have low ac they take a serious pounding at
higher levels. Suggest he/she back off some when taking such a pounding that
it results in near death and try to not generate aggro thru dmg shields et
al.
