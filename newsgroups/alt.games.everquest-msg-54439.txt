Ummm, no.
Your PRIMARY job is to keep the mob's aggro.  The fact that you can
absorb damage is secondary.  Besides, at higher levels you have /disc
defensive anyways.

You know, there's a very good reason why warriors are the only class
to get 230 Taunt skill...while several other classes get the same
Defense skill cap as warriors....

A no meleer at level 60 can hit the haste cap without at least a
dragon level haste item + enchanter haste buff.

If you really think a warrior cannot generate damage, you're smoking
crack.  A fully hasted warrior armed with a Krez's Flame + Primal can
generate absolutely SICK amount of damage.  It's not a macho thing,
it's a direct impact on the effectiveness of the tank.

Ever seen a non-hasted tank in a group with a monk/rogue with a dragon
level haste item?  Hint:  Clerics won't be casting many CH on the
tank.
