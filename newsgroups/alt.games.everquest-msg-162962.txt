On my level 50 Ranger?  No, I haven't looked at his archery DPS,
mainly because I don't really use his archery as a main form of
combat.  At this point, his skill is maxed.  If I'm soloing, I use
archery to pull.  I have used archery to soften up a mob before I move
in to melee, but this is the exception.

I *DID* see a ranger in PoI the other day who, in the space of about
10 seconds, got bow hits for 1100, 800, and 600.  So, for a limited
amount of time, the ranger was doing somewhere in the neighbor hood of
250ish DPS.  

BEFORE you jump my shit:  No I didn't have it logged, and now I didn't
have a stopwatch.  No I haven't run exhaustive logs.  But, from
everything I've heard, including stuff from a couple 60ish rangers,
this isn't all that uncommon.  My experience could have been a fluke.
If you wanna dismiss my far from scientific numbers, I wouldn't hold
it against you.

I still say you're wrong though.  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)
