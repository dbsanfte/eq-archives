    They spawn fast, die quick, and there's a zone XP bonus on top of the
dungeon bonus. ;-)

    What tactics have you been using? I want to get my 31 ENCH up to 34 for
Enchant Platinum, and I want to avoid the hassles of LFG'ing all the time at
mid levels. Do you think a 31 enchanter could hold the camp? And if you get
legs, stop camping. You can usually either trade legs for arms straight up,
or sell the legs for enough to buy arms.
