I decided early on to stick with 1hb weapons with my wizard.  That leaves
the off hand for holding another item later on.  Everyone told me not to
worry about weapons because I wouldn't need to fight, but at 14 I still
melee when soloing in order to reduce downtime.  Getting HP & Mana both down
to
50 recovers a lot faster than going oom to kill a mob but still having full
health.

I used a cracked staff until 12 and had just started looking to buy a magic
1hb in E
Commons.  Luckily, a wonderful high lvl caster gave me a Staff of Writhing
in
the FP bank one day so I am using that now, even though it has a -9 CHA stat
on it.

I would definately look for some kind of magic weapon as you will most
likely hunting wisps come lvl 10 or so.
