Did you look into your newbie quest?  eqtraders.com has the best listing 
under quests.

I do know that halfling cultural tailoring includes a 100% WR backpack. 
  I want the bag so bad I can taste it.  Takes a high tailor skill and I 
don't have the patience to have more than one character be a tailor. 
Anyway, the bag takes a shitload of Dire wolf furs, forages in Thurg, 
EW, other IC zones I believe.
