Thing is, though, what if you were comparing leveling a L25 EQ2 character
now to leveling a L25 EQ1 character 5 years ago?  Can you honestly say that
5 years ago, less than ONE MONTH after the game opened, that people were
breezing through Level 25, and some people were already up to Level 40?

Problem is that I doubt you can answer the above question.  I honestly doubt
that anyone can, unless they start up a bona-fide original-code server and
allow only true newbies (well, say, newbies with UO and M59 experience) onto
it.

Honestly, I think your comparison here is an apples / oranges thing.
