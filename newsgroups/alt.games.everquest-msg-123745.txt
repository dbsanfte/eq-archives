'Tis the season, apparently.

I've had the same dial-up ISP for about ten years now,
a local Houston company.  I kept the service even after
I got cablemodem service, both so that my email address
would remain unchanged, and so that I could use the
dial-up as backup whenever the cablemodem service
hiccupped.

The middle of last week, I couldn't retrieve my email.
I figured they were just having technical problems and
it would be back up shortly.  I called them and left
a message on their voicemail (they're a small shop, they
often don't have anyone to play receptionist).

Then days passed...  Still no service...  Still no
return call...

They'd always been very responsive before, and I was
on a first-name basis with their tech guy since I
had called from time to time over the years, and
steered a bunch of new clients their way.  I'd never
had to wait more than 4 hours for a callback before.
I had even spoken with them two weeks previously,
and they had just installed a new server system.

I finally drove over to where their offices were,
and found an empty office suite.  I located the
building management phone number from a nearby
for lease sign in the same complex, and called
to get more info.  They said that the ISP company
had just disappeared one day, left no forwarding 
address, and apparently still owed the building
managers money.

I suspect my dcd@firstnethou.com email box is
now dead forever, along with my web files...

Sheesh.
