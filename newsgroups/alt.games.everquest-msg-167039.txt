HOT spells are buffs, and the check for hate does indeed come at the moment the
spell lands, not later.  On the other hand, the duration is only what, 24
seconds?  Half that is likely to be gone by the time your target first gets hit.

This is absolutely false.  Landing a heal on a FD person does NOT break FD.  In
fact, I absolutely refuse to ever heal a monk pulller who isn't lying on the
ground successfully FDd.  He can die first.  This is because heals (and other
spells, buffs, whatever) not only do not break FD, but do not transfer any hate
to the caster if the monk is FD when it hits.  Many higher level mobs remember
the monk, and will return to him when he stands up from FD, but will not hate
the healer.

One good way to wipe a high level raid is to heal a standing monk... and then
discover that the cleric can't ditch aggro at all, so the twenty mobs that have
the monk on their hate list can't be eliminated except by the cleric running
away from the raid and into certain death as a sacrifice, hoping that the mobs
aren't yet within aggro range of anyone else.

Lets see, another observation.  Remedy is NOT the HOT line.  Remedy and Ethereal
Remedy are fast small direct heals.  What you are looking for is Celestial
Healing, Celestial Elixer, Supernal Elixer.

Important time is when the spell lands.  So your monk can get SE, then stand up
and continue pulling, still getting continuous heals, without transferrring hate
to the cleric.

I believe Naggy AE (like many indoor AE's) is line of sight.  This means that
rather than trying to get Naggy at maximum range, you want him near a corner, so
healers (who's spells are NOT line of sight but ARE short range) can hide around
the corner and heal.  I don't recall using that strategy doing him, but that was
ages ago.  It is a key element of Temple of Veeshan dragon slaying, however.
