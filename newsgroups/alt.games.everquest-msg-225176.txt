I dunno, given when warriors were made that was exactly what they were
supposed to do, it would seem that if you wanted to have 80 more
functions you shouldnt have picked warrior but SK or Pally or
something. It would be like buying a push bike and complaining you had
to peddle..

I pulled out my War on test, killed a whole bunch of stuff, the window
did nothing.  Need to find those books by the sounds of it.. now that
will be interesting......
