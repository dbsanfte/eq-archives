I know Sony used gold, platinum, and titanium.  And it's quite likely
there will be a few more expansions before SOE kills EQ for good so
dunno where would they get the next few valuable minerals next.  Maybe
they could name the next one blue diamond since it's valuable on some
bazaar (MS has them for over 500pp each)
