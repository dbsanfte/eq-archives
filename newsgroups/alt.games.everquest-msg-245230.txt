My experience with enchanters has been watching them solo the caves in DSP
at a lower level than I am. I don't mean individual spawns. My monk can solo
a light blue 'hopper, and could probaby solo a DB if he didn't get any adds
and he was lucky with fear. This guys was soloing loads of red mobs at the
same time.

I've also seen necros soloing in PoJ. One guy went from 55 to 60 in 5 days.
He just ran as the mob sufferred his dots, and as he put it, it doesn't
matter what a mob's DPS is if he can never touch you.

My experience is that monks with great gear might be useful to guilds,
raids, etc, but the description of th monk was clear from day one: they were
not supposed to be as gear dependent as the other classes, hence the weight
limits that made the class painfully poor at money making. Whilst I realise
the 'early' (pre-aa) levels are long forgotten to most people here, I can
testify that the description put out by Sony of the monk is that of someone
who can solo, who doesn't need to be rich, who does a lot of damage with
their bare fists and feet, and disarm an enemy to put them in their place,
and that description is totally misleading.

I don't know exactly what monks are supposed to be but they have drifted far
away from the vision of ascetic martial artist, and that's a shame because
having 'character' makes the game fun, rather than a grind to get things so
you can tell your mates how uber you are.

Tobalus, 56 Druid, Rodcet Nife
Eski, 55 Monk, same.
