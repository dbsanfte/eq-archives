Know what you mean. I quit eq after a year and a half and thought
Conquest of camelot was like eq but better and made it as a beta
tester and afraid to said that game was all show. Gameplay was very
boring. Was lacking the charm of eq. Cool seeing 5 goblins attacking a
poor little sarsak :) And have to say I'm starting to miss EQ and will
probably go back..

If they'd cut downtime in half and make the game a bit better for
soloing it be unbeatable!!

Only Eq can make your nervous about venturing in a new place.
