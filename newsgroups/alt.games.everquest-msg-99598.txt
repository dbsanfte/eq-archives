The spectre lifetap has an insanely short range, like 5-10 feet or
so. Go ahead and root-rot them, I root-nuked them without being hit
by their spells for quite a while when they were blue. Spectre spells
are probably disease and magic based, although I can't remember the
correct resists offhand. This'll be a moot point with their short
range, though.

Hmm, thinking about it, I *fear*-kited them, so I might be mistaken
about the short range. But still, Spectre lifetap is like 38 points
max. or so, so should be eminently survivable.

Another point, though: The spectre caves have really bad pathing and
spectres agro through walls, and then despawn when they try to walk
through the walls (or worse, warp right on top of you). At least,
the pathing was a problem last time I was there.
