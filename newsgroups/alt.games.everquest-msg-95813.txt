A couple I had noticed a few months ago was the buff one. It also did it
with heals and pvp.

Also, before they patched the lev thing (not sure about the rest i am about
to post), if you have the horse model turned off, lev and sow work normally.
Meanwhile, you are riding a horse to those who have the horse models on with
full sow speed and lev.
