Their level 30 spells.  A 45 point Lifedrain (a huge spell for them
since it reduces downtime), a pet that can take more than 1 blow, a
new DOT (heat Blood), invisibility (very nice for SKs since they are
often unwelcome many places) and feign death (makes SKs fearless since
they can get out of most situations).
