Now I see you're actually trying to contribute to the group with this and
other posts.  You have a lot of ground to make up for.  Time will tell
if you're genuine or just trying to lull us, and the new folks, in so you can
shock us all with more drivel at a later time.  We'll see.  Time will tell.
Till then, I'll keep you out of my killfile till I see which way you go.  Not
that it matters to you.
