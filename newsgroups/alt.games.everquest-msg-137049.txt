Ok, so you tried magic-based and cold-based.  Did you try fire or whatever
the lightning based things are called?  My wizzy is 51 but I'm hardly an
expert, but these things stood out.

Also, although I'm sure by now you know better, but you DO know that if a
critter is in water/lava you have to be in the same place?  And if the water
is shallow that adds problems to the mix. :p  The fact that you did get IC
off on him tells me you likely knew this but I figured I'd say something
anyway since I think your main is a big ugly melee, isn't it?
