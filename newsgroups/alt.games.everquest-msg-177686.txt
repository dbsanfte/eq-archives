You enter CC from the back of the Ry'Gorr fort in EW. You have to run
through the main gates, then around the buiding in the center. In back
you will find a small building with a door made of bars (like a jail
cell). Open the door and step inside. In the back of the room is a
white crystal. You click on the crystal to zone into CC (like a PoK
book). I know the above sounds like a trick or scam, but it really is
how you get to CC :-). When you exit CC you will zone into EW outside
of the Ry'Gorr fort in a small hut that is usually safe (50% of the
time). Be ready to run if you can't zone invis.

Once inside CC you will be at the top of the "well". The first half of
the zone is filled with Orcs. If you run through that half, you will
go through a series of tunnels that wind down and through the well,
eventually ending up at the bottom. From the bottom you head our of
the cave(blueish grey rocks) area into the snowy/ice area leading to
the Dwarf town and the rest of the zone.

If you have invis and lev, it is much easier to just drop down the
well. If you have safe fall or a lot of HPs you can drop down the
well, if you are careful to land on the criss-crossing bridges. You do
NOT want to fall all the way down without stopping on the bndges. The
farther you fall in EQ (ie time spent in the air) the more damage you
take.

I spent a lot of time hunting in CC with my retired monk. I don't
remember anything seeing through invis (I'd use potions or get a
superior camo from my druid on a second account) , but then again I
could always Feign Death if I was spotted.
