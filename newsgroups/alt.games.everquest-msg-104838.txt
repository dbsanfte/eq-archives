Wrong. Cheals start before the mob is aggroed.

Another NT on each flurry helps, yes, for the MA who is being chealed.
I specified trying to heal rampage victims. Chloroblast is utterly
useless in keeping rampage victims alive. Nature's Touch cannot cut it
either.

Take last night. We killed Rhag 2 with 3 clerics, 1 shaman and 1 druid
as healers. The tanks did their job and got aggro. I tried to keep 1
of those tanks alive (not the MA obviously). He had 5600 hps. I am
level 60 with 2 levels of crit heals and 3740 mana. At one point a
cleric had to drop from the cheal rotation briefly to keep him
standing. Nature's Touch just couldn't cut it. 

Now in places like HoT I am almost always PH for a group and have zero
difficulty keeping my group alive, with mana and time to spare to heal
the shamans or chanters who get aggro or the SA if we're split
tanking. At the next level of difficulty I might as well play
someone's cleric and leave my druid behind.

To put things in perspective, I think the two classes who DESPERATELY
need help at the end game are necros and magicians. Both are vital to
the end game but I feel so sorry for them. Necros are mana batteries
and that is just not a lot of fun. Magicians spend the bulk of their
time summoning mod rods and items, and can rarely use pets because of
atrocious pathing problems. They need tweaking first, before any other
class.
