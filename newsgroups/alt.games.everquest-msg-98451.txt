They still HAVE to go from 1-10.
They still HAVE to watch were they're sitting.
They still HAVE to look for the occasional griffon. 
None of this has changed!
At least now they can actually look for griffons while medding instead of
finding out it's there because it's wacking on you.

>Why bother learning the lesson now? 

If they don't learn it now (and i'm guessing most will) they ain't gonna get
much above lvl 10 are they?

You suggest in a previous post that they should just skip 1-10 all together and
start at lvl 11 - so when exactly are they going to learn those important
lessons then?

By allowing them to lvl faster you're not taking away those lessons, maybe in
the case of corpse recovery you're postponing the lesson a little, which (IMO)
isn't such a good idea but the lesson is still there to be learnt and anybody
who wants to play IS going to learn those lesson regardless and definately
before they lose true newbie status.
