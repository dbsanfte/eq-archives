I wanted to announce the release of a new Everquest web site,
EQWire.com.

http://eqwire.com/

This website dynamically pulls news from the major Everquest community
web sites and displays it with the most current news at the top.  The
purpose is to offer a quick view of what is happening in the larger
Everquest community.

EQWire is based on the latest news covering the full Everquest
community.  We tried to pick out the top sites that offer Everquest
news that everyone is interested in.  If you don't see a site listed
that you think applies to the whole community, please let us know. 
Send an email to admin@eqwire.com with the URL of the site you'd like
to suggest.

If you run an Everquest community website with frequently updated
news, you can add your source by sending an email to admin@eqwire.com
with the URL of your website.  No work will need to be done on the
site to facilitate this service.
