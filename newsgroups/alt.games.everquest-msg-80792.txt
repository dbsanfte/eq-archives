Not even close to dominant. In fact sometimes it is difficult to 
find a ranger to do recon around the portal keeps.

Nearly everyone has a ranger, but not that many are developed beyond
lvl 10. It take a certain kind of person to develop a ranger to the 
point where they are effective in RvR. In PvE ranger are in the same
boat as an eldrich, they usually don't add much to a group, and 
will often take away from a group.

I hang in the frontier quite a bit, trust me, nobody is harvesting
realm points any more. From what I have seen even the sucessful 
stealth types are only getting a few kills before they run off or 
are hunted down.

In RvR skirmishes, archers are a factor, as they should be, but a 
solo archer dies fast and often.
