Hi all,
A long, long time ago - possibly even in a galaxy far, far away - I
played Everquest. Now at the time, Everquest was young and there were
no expansion packs. I played an Erudite Necro - and managed to get him
up to around 23 - before chucking it all in. Levlling up in Toxxulia
and that damn Kerran dungeon really took it out of me. I went on to
play a Barbarian Shaman - which was a lot more fun. The Tribunal bless
the makers of Blackburrow!

Anyway - I drifted away from Everquest, but recently I've been told
that not only is there a new Erudite city - Painell? But that we also
have a new set of dungeons to take the place of Toxxulia/Kerran
dungeon.

So I was wondering if this was the case, and how other Erudite Necros
felt about how this has affected them. Is playing an Erudite Nec a lot
more fun now? Is it faster to level? IS IT FUN?

Any information would be greatly appreciated, as Im thinking of
signing back up if it seems worth it.
Thanks
Mike
