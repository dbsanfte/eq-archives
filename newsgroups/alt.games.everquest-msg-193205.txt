This made me laugh, I was going to send you an email about it, but decided
to instead reply to group because I was giving out too much personal info
and didn't wanna bore you to tears.
Being an Enchanter, I won't argue with you, if they lowered KEI or took it
out, wouldn't bother me.  But I'm 65th, perhaps they should redistribute the
spells more appropriately like they ended up doing for the graduated cleric
rez spells.  Like 1 mana regen at 1st, 4th, or 8th. 2 at a certain level,
all the way up to 65th with 18 mana regen.  I don't even have breeze in my
spell book personally, because they hadn't even invented it before I was
29th with clarity, which was placed while I was squating in 25ish range
enjoying the new areas there.  Nowadays, I really am not super interested in
the new content at least in land mass.  why do I care if they are adding
planes with (renames) of gods.  Of course I do have all the expansions and
am cleared for HoH and the other decent 3rd tier one after the 2nd tier from
POS one above that, jeez, forgot the fricking name, ah yes, BOT.  gah.  Hate
forgetting names to junk.
What I think all of EQers and most people would agree with is the ability to
actually feel like your playing the game that was more interactive, meaning
like you could actually have some effect on the game.  For example, Building
land that you could actually put realstate on with objects that were
completely cosmetic for looks to that said house.  like tints to PAINT the
house, etc.  oh wait, they did tints in Ykesha of whatever.  and how hard is
it to make preset patterned buildings.
make about 1 building type that had your own personal bank account.  oh
wait, they already doubled spaces in banks.  but why the frick banks?
because it was super easy to code.  would be much more impressive and fun
and probably bring a ton more people to add the ability to have your own
unique bank in this one spot in the new land, that this bank wasn't
connected to the one with 16 slots (8 without Yak exp)  chances of them
doing this, slim.  they are adding this to EQ 2, I guess.  other factors
though makes EQ 2 less attractive, one being no transfer from the 1st ( at
least the current subscriber base).  sorry about rehashing old topics
though, this has been said like umpteen different times on here, its not a
new idea.

I played UO third dawn and the one before it.  the first one was way way too
slow, so I dumped it, although I never bothered to return the disk.
obviously my internet connection speed at that time wasn't up to the task,
and was my fault, so not returning the disk makes sense.  UO:Third Dawn had
some great graphics, although ultimately the graphics is why I left.  I
missed the concept of rares, which was basically as far as I was concerned
fluff.  Nice thing about UO:Third Dawn was the implemented idea I have about
housing.  of course EQ would have to not exactly copy the established
UO:Third Dawn system.  That is if they ever bother to do it, which
appearantly they have no intention of doing, since they are putting this
high desirable feature in EQ 2.  I'm wondering spell slots in EQ 2??  and
bag limits.
Funny that they had 16 slot bags in Beta for EQ, and yet in the actual
subscription, HARD limit is 10.  so space changing isn't alot of coding?

Yea, on the Bristlebane server it was one of the few items that actually
rised in price, and has
avoided the standard deflationary economy.
