Most guilds who were constantly keeping RZ dead to block others, suddenly
lost all interest once he was in a state of constant repopping, and being
unable to keep dead (hence other guilds could progress into the elementals)

On Prexus, guild1 killed every RZtW pop... said they needed the loot..
bitched and whined when guild2 tried to "zerg" RZtW (page 2 of that thread I
linked you)..   RZtW had a life expectancy of minutes.

Once guild2 were able to take proper shots at him (and kill him) because of
the repopping, and gained access to the elementals, they suddenly lost all
interest in RZtW....

Hes up for days on end now... and Im sure that won't change until the next
guild tries to kill him, whilst a guild is still farming elementals

I do think LC had their own interests in mind when making any kind of
"deal".. and they did try to cockblock rivals, but I won't flame them for
it.

Every server has it... most guilds do it.  Its been done to us, we do it to
others.. to me its just normal every day life.   Protect your own interests,
cuz you can be sure no other guild gives a damn about them

Start reading prexus flames board...  this will just be every day shit thats
not even a big deal anymore :)
