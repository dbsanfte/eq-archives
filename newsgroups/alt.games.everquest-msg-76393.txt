A guildie of mine can't get rid of the ginger haired female barbarian
with the red face paint, which she consideres the ugliest. She used to
be blonde with blue stripes and can't get it back.

The key to avoid messing with your old face is to not change the
'face' option itself (note that this is the only thing not changed by
the face randomizer). Hairstyle, hair color, eye color and whatever
beard options male characters have are all safe to change.

The changing window is also opened by typing /facepick - the Face
button (and AA button) is only available to people using the Velious
interface.
