I went from dial-up to PacBell aDSL and have been quite happy.  Cable
was not available at the time and I've had no reason to want to dump
my DSL.

A gating factor to leaving DSL is that I'm about 200 cable yards from
the switch.  I don't see me dropping them unless that changes.

As for gaming, I've played at a friend who has cable and he's played
on my DSL.  Neither of us noticed any difference in EQ.
