  Without having reverse engineered the patching program, my guess is that
this is roughly what happens.  I doubt they have only one patch server.  The
patch program probably connects to one of several servers to download the
patches.  Allowing us to download them via http/ftp clients of our choosing
would be nice, but it wouldn't fix the problem.  The bottleneck appears to
mainly be THEIR servers on THEIR end.  The only thing they could do to
remedy the situation is: A) Buy more servers/bandwidth or B) Make their
files available to 3rd party servers.  Option A, according to their web
site, is currently underway, and Option B is not a favorable solution for
Verant because then they partially lose control over the manner in which
their files are distributed.  Verant obviously does not want to endorse
downloading files from 3rd party servers, because then somebody might try to
hold them liable when a virus appears on somebody's server that's
distributing EQ files, ect.

  Though under current circumstances, I sure wish of someplace else that I
could download these files from.
