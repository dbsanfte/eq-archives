Sure, and so do I... but this was a discussion about balance, which generally
means people talking about the 'optimal', i.e. 'what your role in a group
that did care only about the numbers would be'.

I dont see sharing out core abilities while leaving one class as premier at
it as a bad thing, and, frankly knowing plenty of clerics (ok, so my game
is all generally around 50-60) who duo just fine and so forth I dont have
much sympathy for the screaming.

Now, you can say your group never waits LFG for a cleric; true... most of the
clerics I know never are, and never will be, LFG either - they have friends
and guildies they could always get a group with, even if their best heal was
minor healing.

But thats not the point of this discussion, as I see it... *grin*
