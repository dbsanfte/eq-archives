Most of the people that go online and claim others they meet there are
nerds, geeks and have no life are actually incredibly successful, self made
millionaires (they're often quite a guy) who have wives and/or girlfriends
who are models, drive Sports cars or Corvettes and play paintball at
competition level. They are actually trying to help you find a life,
girlfriend, purpose to live other than your nerdy online game.
You should really be gratefull this youngster had seen this at an early age
and tried to help you before he went out and partied with this jetset
friends.
