My Iksar Shadow Knight made his level 22 training run back home to
Kunark last night.  I was 2 1/2 blues short of level 22 when I hit the
beach in The Overthere.

I ran to the giant Iksar statue outside the Warslick's Woods zone
boundry and began stalking Kunark Rhino's and Sarnaks.

15 minutes and 4 kills later, I dinged 22.

I killed 2 rhinos, a sarnak conscript, and a cockatrice (forgot breed)

I remained in the zone another 20 minutes and continued to kill
sabertooths, flunkies, and another rhino before I made my mad-dash
through Warslick's to Cabilis.

When I arrived in Cabilis, I had 3 full blues into level 22.

I had just left the new zone, Stonebrunt Mountains, before I started
making my way toward Kunark.  My Iksar has been land-locked on Odus
for the past 4 weeks.

I can honestly say, that I gained more experience in the last hour I
was online last night, than I have in the past week of playing 3-4
hours every night.

Needless to say, I will linger around in The Overthere for few more
hunts before I make my way back to Antonica...my buddy has 2 levels on
me and I'm gonna catch up to him before you can say "Iksar's Rule!"
