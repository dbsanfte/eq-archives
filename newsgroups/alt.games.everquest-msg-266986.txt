Played on one of the RP servers (don't remember the name it is the Sony 
designated RP server) and Butcherblock. Had no issues.
My machine:
    P4 3.02 HT
    2G RAM (maybe this is a deciding factor)
    6800 GeForce Ultra 128M
    1280x1024 but in windowed mode. So can popup browser over the top.
Turned graphics up to the highest settings and had some hickups, took off 
shadows (everything else maxed) and all is good.
Decent machine, but not the best there is.

Wife's machine is a P4 1.8 same config otherwise and she only complained 
about lag until she realized she did not have her keyboard mapping right 
(was clicking keys that "did nothing because of lag" that in reality just 
"did nothing" :) )
