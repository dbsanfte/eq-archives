Never seen the movie :) And I apologize for being so bristly about it, but
where I live (Alabama) I get preached at every time anyone finds out my
religious preference (don't flaunt it but I dont make a secret of it either)
and I just left a really snert and troll filled IRC chat that started off as
an introduction to Asatru for young adults , and turned into a shit-slinging
fest.

Anyway, Ben, sorry for getting my neck-hairs up about your comment, I didnt
realize it came from a movie. Accept my apologies.
