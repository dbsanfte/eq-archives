I had an interesting idea about this....
Make it so you have to exit through the same portal you entered.
That way POK is always close, but you cant use it to travel.
All I ask is they do away with the boats. I dont mind running through
several zones, and I dont mind the boat ride so much.
Sitting waiting for the boat isnt much fun tho.
