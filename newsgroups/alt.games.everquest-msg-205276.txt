If I may make a suggestion: at level 24 you get Wolf Form.  The
combination of Wolf Form, Harmony, and the porcupine method in
the Estate of Unrest is VERY effective and will take you into
your 30's.  You'll get plenty of loot and this method will also
help increase your offensive and defensive skills.

You may be asking yourself, "Why is Wolf Form necessary?"  It's
because the undead don't aggro on druids in wolf form.  You can
enter the Estate of Unrest in relative safety and apply Harmony
liberally to anything near the mob you've targeted.  Slap on
your damage shields and melee away.

Another advantage to the Estate of Unrest is you can probably
easily find a group if you're not in the mood to solo.  But the
soloing there is very effective for druids who are 24+.
