    The Warrens used to have the trivial loot code. The devs didn't want
items from The Warrens to end up on vendors where others who couldn't camp
them could snap them up. So the merchants have no purchase memory. When the
newspaper vendors were put in across the world, the person putting them in
forgot about the "no purchase memory" thing in Paineel and that's why that
vendor has space for stuff bought. Since the TLC is now dead, there's no
reason to fix the newspaper vendor.

    And Paineel has always been crappy for tradeskills. I was hoping back
when some of the other evil cities were fixed that Paineel would be fixed,
but no dice.
