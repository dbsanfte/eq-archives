I think that they may see it as detrimental to the game because the player
can essentially make money while they are asleep / offline etc much like the
tradeskill macroing, and therefore not what Sony are going to want to see
due to making plat with no real time expenditure from the player. I think
there's the potential for them to lump unattended tradeskill macroing and
this sort of macroing in the same boat. If both actions are automated,
unattended and make money, I guess I can see why they might liken them.

Of course if they didn't accept trades... then it'd be a different question
I imagine. That's really all I could think of off the top of my head.
