If it makes you feel any better, I have a similar problem on my PII
400 (640 Meg Ram, 64 Meg ATi 7200). My connection goes link dead in EQ
up to three or four times an hour, and thats using a 512K broad band
connection.

Everything else is fine, except Everquest.

I am using win 2K, and have completely reinstalled the OS, so that
there is nothing installed except EQ (before I did that I could not
even find the patch server)
