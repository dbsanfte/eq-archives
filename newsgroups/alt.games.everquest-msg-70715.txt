Huh?  The fungi tunic is used to decrease downtime;  so's the
meditate skill.  Would you think playing a druid suddenly got
more fun if VI removed the meditate skill from druids?   If I'd
bought a fungi for an alt, it's *sole* purpose would be to reduce
downtime, the part of the game I (and I'd guess most people)
find the least fun.
