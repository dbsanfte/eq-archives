Ram first, vid card second, cpu is probably more than fine.

I'm on a tnt 16 meg agp with 575 mbytes of ram, p2 400. Getting up to
384 meg of ram with luclin was about the best improvement for me so I
added some more which did not make much of a difference. Now the only
bottleneck for me is the vidcard for the most part and a geforce 64
meg of some kind would improve things greatly. At both 384 and 575 I
have all luclin models on and social animations, with texture mem set
to low. Texture mem setting to low uses a ton of less memory. Now that
umbra works for me that helps me a LOT also, but I think some amd
users still have trouble with umbra and possibly geforces with umbra.

If I were you I'd go another 256 meg dimm or whatever first, making
you have 512 meg of ram. I'd then suggest limiting vcache to 32 meg or
64 meg max or whatever or it tends to get huge with win 98 (what you
are probably using) I'm doing well in 98 with 575 meg of ram and a
cache limitation of 32 meg in EQ.
