Well, sort of.  You can add the other skills to the 10 slot hot button bank.
To do that you just left click the button until the hot button appears on
your cursor.  Then you drop that into the hot button slot where you want it.
Then if you want to replace that slot on your combat or skills button bank,
just select another skill for that spot.  A lot of people dont even use the
built in 6 slot hot button banks becuase they like to mix and match the
things they need the most on their 10 slot customizable hot button bank.
