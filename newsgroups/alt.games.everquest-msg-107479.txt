Just purchased EQ. Installed and got the DX 8.1 upgrade message. Went to
Verant's web site and was instructed to reinstall video and sound drivers
after upgrading DX to 8.1. I already have the newest drivers and Microsoft
has no such requirement.

So, has anyone not reinstalled drivers after the DX upgrade with or without
problems running EQ? If so, please let me know.

Thank you.

Bob C
