i know a lot of people don't have it

it's not crucial

but for those that have it, especially the advanced channelling focus
aa's...

is it worth the aa cost?

does it make a noticeable difference?

do you recommend it?

and if it is worth getting, what classes would benefit from it most? and
don't say 'people who solo' because that's a separate question...
