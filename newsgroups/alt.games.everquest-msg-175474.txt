Does that go for your sentence as well?

I was just looking for the facts

Just the facts ma'am.

What figures did you use to work out that China is
the largest producer of pollution, and that the US
is not in the top ten?

I have to admit I like your style, in covering all
bases.

 You seem to be saying;

1. The US is not the world's biggest producer of
pollution

2, Even if it is the biggest producer, it is very
nice pollution, as pollution goes.

3. Whatever sort of pollution it is, it is hardly
worth bothering about.

Why would you want to reduce CO2 emissions?
