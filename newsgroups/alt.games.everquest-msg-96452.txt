    That doesn't help. One of the things I've found frustrating about the
new graphics is how it's changed how I look to others versus how I look to
myself. The face change REALLY gets me - my non-SoL look is now a beardless
dwarf female, which destroyed 60 levels of pride and perseverance in the
face of countless "/em hands you a razor" emotes and taunting. I enjoyed
looking different, and looking "like a real dwarf lass should!" Now, half
the people out there don't see that when they look at me and have no idea
why I'm talking about my beard.

    The same is true of the gnome shadow knights. It doesn't matter what *I*
see, if everyone else can't see me looking like Dark Helmet then it's
pointless to act like I do. I think that's the one thing about the new
models that gets me the most - they're not updated old models, but
completely new models. In some cases that's neat (the custom helm look for
dwarf females is awesome), but in many cases it just stinks.
