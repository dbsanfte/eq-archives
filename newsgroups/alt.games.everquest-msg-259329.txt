I think unintended utility is a perfectly good description of an 
exploit, and applies to pet pulling perfectly.

Your counter-argument misses the mark, alleging that pets are a 
hindrance in raids does not somehow make pet pulling less of an exploit.

They are separate issues.

Consider SOEs position on Pet Canni... its the same argument really. 
Extra utility from utiliy deprived pets.


On the flip side, their -is- possibly a counterbalancing argument that 
argues in favour of pet pulling as legit. The very same mechanics that 
enable pet pulling make pets very dangerous to use at low levels.

Consider a 15th level mage in the warrens: the pet will pull swarms of 
adds that would have not jumped the PC. Worse the adds are all 
runners... and will run at 50% health (very quickly pulling swarms 
more)...

FWIW I'm not convinced that either should happen. I think mobs should 
react to the pet as if its your level, and your faction if its engaged. 
And should ignore it completely if its not engaged.
