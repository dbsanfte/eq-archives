Well, personally i got a level 63 druid and a 56 monk. And you know 
what? I got money, lots of them. Not bought, but MADE. Made my first 10K 
with my level 18 rogue, and my druid can make 3K+ a day soloing in the 
right spots while making XP. That kinda collide with your wierd post.
Someone ALWAYS been selling stuff on Ebay and places like that, and you 
know what, the game havent died in the last 3 years from that.

Yantis dont use corrupt GMs to get money. What he does is buying stuff 
cheap, and selling high. Just like everyone else can do. Example, i 
bougth a Horn of Hsagera for 50K a while back, and managed to trade it 
for the Boots of Flowing Slime, which goes for 75-85K on my server. 
thats a easy 25-35K profit, which i then can us to buy other cheap stuff 
and sell that for normal prices. Thats the easiest way to make money in 
EQ. Buy low, and sell high. Harder with bazaar (the bazaar really ruined 
the economy, since everyone just see what item XX is selling for, and 
sell it for 1pp less, crashing the market for all but the rare items, 
which in turn hurt the newbies money making abilities, since their loot 
is close to unsellable).

What you totally ignore in your post is the fact that pp and items are 
NOT gonna leave the game again once its in. When a mob drop 3pp, you got 
3pp more in cash flow on the server. That cause inflation, and the 
prices drop, apart on the rare items that are so popular that the 
sellers can keep charging high prices (if a item only drop once a week, 
theres a LOT less competition on selling it). Sony have added the horses 
and drogmors to the game to try and get rid of some money, but the fact 
remains that at some time, you cant really use your PP for anything any 
more, because theres no big sellable upgrades. And then you have a 
potential ebay seller, since he can have for maybe 500$ in the bank just 
lying there he cant use for anything. Then he go sell to Yantis for 
maybe 400$, since he just wanna get rid of it. Yantis then sell for 
500$, and made a nice little 100$ profit.

Personally ill give you 3 on the troll scale, since you DID manage to 
get a lot of answers, and answer to the posts to keep the thread going, 
but since you done nothing but give out unsupported claims (i can do 
that too. Yantis cant fly. A rock cant fly. Thus Yantis must be a rock), 
but it dont really help your case. Now go away and troll somewhere else.
