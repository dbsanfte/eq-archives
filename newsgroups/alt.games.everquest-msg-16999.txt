I've been in Mistmoore. I've also had to pick through the pile of high
twenties to high thirties corpses to find mine and drag it back to the
cleric at that zone line. <grin> This is noplace for a level 1 to "hang
around" waiting for a free drop. It's a nice theory, but I'd love to see
the experiment of somebody actually trying it.
  That being said, there are certainly a lot of other pieces which
nobody but a warrior would want where a clever invis fist level could
grab the goods. (Griffon eye, bundle of optic nerves, aviak charm) but
the dark circlet, fire totem and frost totem would also be dicey for our
intrepid 1st level to loot. This would be a *really* great guild event
for somebody to hold. Everyone create a 1st level warrior, don't kill
anything so you stay at level one, and see how many pieces of crafted
armor you can get. I may have to suggest this.

I don't know, but if you did you'd probably make about seven levels at
once. Interesting thought on powerleveling. Hrmmmm.

Ah, and theres' the meat of it then. I will certainly agree with you
that a level one can do any quest that doesn't involve going to the
planes, providing they have a lot of uberlevel friends to effectively do
the quest for them. A level 1 player could also kill Vox when you look
at it in that light. However, there are many many quests that a level
one player can not do on their own, no matter how much money and
ubertwinkgear they may have.
