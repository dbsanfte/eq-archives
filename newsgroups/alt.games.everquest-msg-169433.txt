Yesterday was grouped in Great Divide when our druid's health started
dropping even though there were no nearby MOBs. They were being hit with
Wrath repeatedly. When he untargeted to use the autotarget-attacking-MOB
feature we all assisted him... and the attacking wurm was out of range
of our nukes.

In the end he zoned. Shortly thereafter my cleric was similarly attacked,
probably because I had been healing the druid.

Eventually we all zoned out to Thurg. (And EQ crashed to desktop for me,
which has been happening more often since PoP, but the group was winding
down anyhow.)

I figure the MOB will die no later than the next patch anyway...

At minimum I think they're allowing casting through obstacles at any range.

        ...Ronny
