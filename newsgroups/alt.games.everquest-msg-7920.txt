NOT ONLY!!! Did I make level 15 in Crushbone, but my group totally rocked in
the castle. We even got trained by Crush himself, and killed him. I went
back and forth mezz'ing the lego's and the oracles. Eventually, he died with
noone in the party dying. But then, we totally got trained by his troops.
Horrable train; lasted longer than I cared to stay on. I lived the whole
time. I had full HP actually, until I was running to the zone invis'ed and
one of them saw me, hit me, and they all beat the snot out of me. It looked
like a train from BlackBurrow. It was huge!!! Anyway, I got hit through the
zone wall with like 1 HP left. I popped up in GF in the dead middle of the
zone. Loc: 20, -10, 0. I had 1 HP when I got there. Our ranger tracked me
down and healed me. It was amazing. I thanked my god for it. Now, I am lvl
15, have a half bubble into it. And I'm ready to keep kicking the crush's
ass. I think I can still do that until I'm 16. I got half a bubble for
almost no fighting. King Crush watch out! Hehe...
