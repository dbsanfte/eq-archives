I have pretty much strictly soloed my enchanter, so I have had no trouble
reaching 23 so far, as I have not had to deal with bonehead groupmates.
Sure, I've died a few times, but it only takes one or two kills to make up
the xp at this level.

As for the druid, I ran into the problem of getting bored with him, and
abandoned him a long time ago, then, recently, I picked him back up again,
and quickly put 4 levels on him.  Paludal Caverns is just amazing xp.  I am
working on trying to get him to the group port level.
