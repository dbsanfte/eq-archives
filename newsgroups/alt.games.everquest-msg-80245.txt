I got to wondering how my necro would handle that while in there the
other day with my warrior. I do the pulling there, and the one crusader
(wandering) will path up into the hallway. I'm often able to pull him
alone. That just leaves the other two, one cruiser and one warrior. 

If I was going to try it with a necro, it seems like you could edge up
close enough to target one and ST him and run to the water. The other
would follow, and the ST'd one would stay there? Sounds like it might
work, anyway.

As to the Rock Golem? Solo? I'd hate to try it in that small space with
any class that couldn't be 100% positive of rooting him for a LONG time.
He's a bit of a bastard.
