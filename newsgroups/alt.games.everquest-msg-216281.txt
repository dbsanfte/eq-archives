While this can be a problem, it isn't one thats based on the class, its based on
play style.  Necro mez is better than bard mez, although bards are better at CC
because they can also use charm as part of the package.

100 compared to 125.  Ranger track is 200, which is a much bigger jump over 125
than 125 is over 100.  Plus rangers get all the track sorts, while druids and
bards are stuck with "last popped, first on list", and the ability to include or
exclude players.  There's little practical difference between druid and bard
track, except for a few spots where the bard isn't quite able to get close
enough to see a rare spawn without aggroing mobs; SORZ comes to mind.
Fortunately, I was able to scout that spawn with an Eye of Zomm off my SS helm;
but a druid could just stand there on the bridge out of range of the guardians
and hit track.

I thought bard track capped at 75, imagine my surprise when it kept going up.
