We had Fear scheduled as a guild thing.  I didn't expect her up but was
thrilled to see her.  All throughout the day I was getting tells from
enchanters who just wanted to come up and take the critter...didn't want to
intrude on our raid.

I had one offer me 200,000p to back away and let her get it.  I have 2k in
the bank...that's a lot of money to me...BUT, I'd lose my guild if I even
CONSIDERED selling my epic.
