No, it was -NOT- said that updates would be posted in the patcher.
Just that updates would be given. -WHERE- was never mentioned. You
assumed they meant in the patcher window. Clearly you assumed wrong,
even if it seemed logical.

Alright, fine. Give me the fucking quote where they said "Updates will
be given -IN THE PATCHER- every hour."

Didn't think so. Shut the fuck up.
