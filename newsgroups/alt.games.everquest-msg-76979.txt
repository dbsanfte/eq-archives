I wrote the message boards for our Guild in PHP / PostGres originally.  I 
also did the membership roster, News, events, buy / sell / trade board, and 
everything else that way.  Almost 100% of the text on the web page was in 
the database.  Since Cox@home frowns on you running your own servers, I had 
to shut it down.  It was damned slick, if I may say so myself.

I did find a provider that uses PHP and I believe Postgres ( maybe MySQL, 
too ).  For 7-8 dollars a month, you can use Powweb.com and get all of 
this.  At this time, I'm not going to pay that for our guild web page, but 
if people want to donate for it, I will redo the whole thing again and put 
it there.  I use Powweb for a company's web site that I coded, and have no 
problems at all with them.

If I weren't just out of range for DSL, I would switch so I could run my 
own servers again.  Friggin' Cox.
