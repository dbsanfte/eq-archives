Not sure what the auction price is now, but when I bought one about 6 months
ago for my Pally it was approx 2500p....I know prices have dropped, but I
bet you can get minimum 1000p for it and prob more like 1500-2000 or trade
for equipment around that price....EXCELLENT pick up in my opinion, and I
bet the person sold it VERY much by accident........
