After asking about it here, I started the quest for the cloak of truth 
in Katta for my cleric twink a few days ago. I've done the initial 
running around, talking to NPC's, etc. and gotten to the stage where I 
have to get the book off the desk in the locked room where the vampire 
guardian spawns fifteen seconds after you enter.

I got a rogue friend to go with my cleric, he picked the lock, and the 
book was not there. We checked all over the desk where it's supposed to 
be, the two bedside stands, the bookshelf, etc. No book that can be 
picked up. (There is one book lying flat on the desk, but it's just a 
graphic, and the quest info I read specifically said that's not it 
anyway.) I have camped there in the room and logged back in several 
times over two days, and no book has appeared. Once I tripped the trap 
by accident and had to gate out before the vampire arrived. The rogue 
came back with me again later, opened the door, and that time we even 
killed the vampire and searched the room at great length. (The vampire 
actually dropped some Rog/Bard shoes that were an upgrade for him, so it 
wasn't a total loss!) But still no book.

Is the published quest info wrong? Has the book been moved to a 
different location? (I've searched all three rooms on that floor near 
the guy who is the owner of it.) Might it be bugged, or just some 
hideous, week long respawn time on the book?

Any thoughts or help appreciated.
