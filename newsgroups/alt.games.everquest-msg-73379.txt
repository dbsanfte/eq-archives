Dunno, it just gets to be a pain to spend the first ten minutes in FV trying
to get a bind.  And then there are always fun things like trying to get
bound in Qeynos, and seeing that there isn't a single caster in the zone
who's capable.  Would it really have killed Verant to give hybrids the
ability?  But it really doesn't matter now, they've fixed the problem.
Sure, there are still some places that aren't covered by the NPC's, but the
major ones are, and enough that you can run around Norath with some bit of
security.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.

Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
