Oh, dear. James has lost his temper, and I can see this is going to take
some time. 
*sigh*
Cutting through hypocricy always takes such a deressingly sharp knife.

Nope. Haven't been there. As to your <snipped> points about "how much
time it takes"... do you want it or not? Risk vs. reward, right? RIGHT?
Others may still want the reward. Again... "nuff said". [ick]

Kills me to do it, but I'm going to go further than this. The reason it
kills me is that you just proved everything you are arguing against. If
seeing a statue trapped in his bubble is .... what was it again? Refresh
my memory..

> coolest parts of the zone.

Ah! So seeing something that doesn't result in PH4T L3WtZ can be the
"coolest part of the zone"?  We may be getting somewhere. For those too
bored to read further, that's the end of the argument, James. Waking the
sleeper, seeing the script that you "boo hoo" below, and being the ones
to do it and experience it for the only time on the server, that's the
reward. You've already admitted it right there without intending to.
ANYBODY could see the stupid statue sleeping in the bubble if they can
get the keys and kill a couple warders. So if that's the "coolest part
of the zone" to you, then the final script is even cooler. End of
debate. But I'll press on to the rest of the boohooism because your
sudden 180 degree turnaround and sudden anger fascinates me.
(I think most folks can stop reading at this point.)

[Yawn...] Yes. We along with anyone with a character over fifty and a
chance in hell of getting in a guild that might someday take down a
first brood has already researched it and read it.

Lovely try, if inept. If you are capable of putting together an ST team,
then giving up those items isn't huge because you could get more. How?
SAME WAY YOU DID LAST TIME! Hello? Is this on?

Ahhhhhhh.... why do you go? For the PH4T L3WTz? Oh. I guess so. Well,
everyone does, but also for other goals. And you know that too.

I'm flattered. Even touched. Or wait.... maybe frightened. Somebody you
only know from a stupid fucking USENET GROUP, and FIVE MINUTES talking
to one of your level three alts at the GBay spires made you change your
WHOLE NORRATHIAN PHILOLOPHY????????????/

And suddenly all your "holier than thou" fucking bullshit about how
raiding guilds are crap, a waste of your time, etc. is out the window.
Right? RIGHT?
Sad, James......... very sad.

Well, you sure showed me. What was that you killed the other day? The
AOW, wasn't it? Nice xp group. Oh, yeah. we camp him all the time. Great
xp and not bad loot. Pfffffft.

Yep. you've shown you were more full of shit than a Christmas Goose on

Gee, and which stupid green troll was the one trying to tell you it's

Exactly. And you know that too. It's a lot more than your little
boohooist snide comments. It's doing something nobody else has done.
Sadly, it cut you out of the PH4T L3WTz, which thus far has been your
ONLY argument against doing it.

See above. Non Loot Rewards. (NLR). You used to believe in those.

Ah, but if they HAD released the sleeper with a *DIFFERNT* tactic, then
that would be ok, right? [Yawn] Hey, James. Did you develop that "lame
archery tactic"? I thought not. Don't act so fucking superior.

ahhhhhhh... and here we see the root of the boohooism. You had to
"FORCE" the rotation agreement, eh? Oh yeah. Everyone else sucks. You
guys are angels. You're so full of shit your eye's could be mined as a
natural resource. But yet below, you talk dismissively of the peons who
come after you when there are "too many" folks to have a rotation. Your
hypocricy sickens me, James. There's enough to FORCE a rotation if it's
YOU. But later? Pfffft. Right. Well guess what? You were the ones who
were too late and "pfffft" on your server for the sleeper.

Nope. Bzzzzt. Totally wrong. Weak and lame. You are making a judgement
on ANY group of up to hundreds of end game players who decide to finish
the Sleeper script. I'm only deciding that YOU are a pompous hypocrite
for being a boohooist if they achieved it.

Nothing if all you want is fat loot and other non-loot acomplishments
mean nothing to you. But you pay your ten bucks like anybody else.
Enjoy.

So.......... you were going to pharm the warders with a new strategy
that had never been tried? Would this get you more loot? Kill a bigger
mob? Would it... oh, never mind. It wouldnt'.

Produce some numbers that show that a signifigant portion of all EQ
players get ST keys, and I will not only apologize here, but show up on
the server you name with the character named as you demand, and kiss
your ass in public. Otherwise, your hypocratic bullshit still piles up
to astounding proprotions. I know how many people play on OUR server. I
know how many have ST keys within one dozen. Five percent is actually
HIGH. On some older servers, possibly more. But not much. Bring me the
head of the enemy, James. 5% is a generous number.

Yeah. You pissed them off with your forced rotation on an even smaller
loot zone. They punished you. But they still got the big prize. Looks
like "competition" for the big prize to me, and you pushed their
tolerance. Different story on every server, same result. Your canoe has
no paddles.

You aren't that dense. Please stop pretending you are. The *technical*
challenge to waking the sleeper may be killing the warders. The *reward*
is in DOING IT. And again, you know that. You're just floundering here
now.

The words of the true boohooist. Had it BEEN you, you'd have been in
here and everywhere else crowing. And you know that too.

Yep. It tells me you were so pissed off at the fat loot you wouldn't get
that you stayed away. [Yawn]

AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!! So let me see... HOW did they know
this? Because somebody DID IT. Ok, let me ask you. Is it safe to assume
that in your pompous glory, you'll at least give a pass to the guild
that did it on the first server for the first time? Were THEY ok in your
book? But the ones who wanted to do it on the second server
were............. "assholes". Right? Hypocrite.

You pompous ass. Fine. By your definition, then the people who wake the
sleeper first have determined that the number TWO is "too big". You
happen to be, what? Five, on your server? So is SIX too big? Ten?
Twenty?

Hypocrite.

Fine. Blame server lifetime spawns of the sleeper on your boohooist
argument. Every word of your "defense" shows me that everything is ok as
long as you get to the loot first, and everybody who comes later is "too
late and too many" etc. and anyone who takes something before you is a
greedy asshole.
 BULL......... FUCKING ......... SHIT.......... HYPOCRITE


I'm done with this. You noramlly discuss things fairly rationally and
are a good debate opponent. Now you want to get all pissy because I
pointed out that the person who trashed raid guilds here just killed the
AOW and is a whiner about not being able to farm primal. And the real
killer is that you want to blame ME for your poor, sorry ass being
"forced" to go join a raid guild. 

Very sad.
