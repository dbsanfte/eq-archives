Last night I dusted off my warrior.  Its been awhile, so I pick up a group
in the corner in the Overthere.  Had one heck of a puller (Ranger btw) and
she'd come back with 4 or more sometimes.  Using that assist key (targeting
her) we beat them down like a quisinart. (pardon my spelling)  As things get
going I take a look to see that my group is 2 monks, the ranger and I with
the rangers sister as the cleric.  Not only did we kick some major butt, the
exp was flying, and the cleric barely had to heal us.  She even rounded up a
few stragglers that wandered off.

Normally in a group, if we've got casters that are getting beat on they have
some sort of hot key set up for the group to let us know "Hey get over
here!!  The critter is wacking on me!"  Not always, but most of the time
anyway.  Unless I'm in a dungeon where its a little more difficult to tell,
I can usually turn around and give the critter a few wacks to get its
attention again.  Hopefully by then we've got it rooted, so the caster can
back up a little bit and won't get hurt more.

The running around with the mob on you like someone set your pants on fire
only gives you the chance to aggro another critter, especially in a dungeon.
Get that hot key set up.  Sometimes we warriors just need a kick in the
pants to notice your getting hurt.  In the thick of battle with 4 mobs all
beating on us we don't always notice that extra one that came in to see
what's going on.

My 2cps worth, no flames intended, only opinions from a warrior.  And BTW
big hugs to the Kree family last night from the Grand Norathian Vanguard on
Brell.  I had a blast!
