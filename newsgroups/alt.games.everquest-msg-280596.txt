Thats an interesting chart, but where is the source data coming from? 
And why doesn't it show the latest data point for some of the games, 
including the most interesting one, EQI?  On the chart it looks as 
though its currently just as popular as WOW... until you realize that 
the last data point for it is from Jan 05 (or no, they aren't really on 
the points marked, it looks more like Octoberish), instead of the Jul 05 
point (well maybe its May 05) that WOW ends with.
