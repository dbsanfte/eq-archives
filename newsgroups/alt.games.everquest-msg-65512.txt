Ran into a bizarre thing last night. Tried to start EQ again after my
umpteenth hardware/configuration change, and got booted to desktop with
a message that I was out of room on my C: drive.  C: is just where I
keep my operating system and small stuff. EQ actually lives in D: where
I have tons of room. I go to "My Computer" to glance at C: and sure
enough, I have this whopping big folder named "EQBackup". I was in no
mood to even fuck around at that point, and I just deleted the sumbitch.
Logged in and all went back to normal.

But I've been playing a bit over a year and never saw that before. Is
this new, or did some setting change to make it start backing stuff up
to the C: drive by default? Can I change this? It's a pain in the ass.
