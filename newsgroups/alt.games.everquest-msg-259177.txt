We exhibit the same symptoms:   I also go back about four items on most
anything I buy.  I don't peel off the circular seals on games for fear of
box damage.  Instead, I very carefully slit the top seal with a pen-knife.
Needless to say, all documentation and promotional literature stays with the
box (I used to photocopy game manuals to study and mark-up), plus original
receipts, return-receipts for price matches, etc.  In the day of the big
boxes, I used to add floppies with patches, walkthroughs, and forum posts
with general game info.  Strat guides I keep separate, except for the one
for BG2 which fits very nicely into the collectors edition box.

The worst nightmare scenario with a game was BG1 with that bloody stupid,
useless CD folder those cheap bastards used.  I opened the box and to, my
horror, all the CD's were rolling around loose!  A couple of them were
pretty well scratched-up, but, fortunately, everything ran ok.  The CD's
immediately went into jewel cases.

As for my kid:  he immediately throws away the box and misplaces the manual
w/i a couple of days.  All he cares about is the game CD.  Odd. :)
