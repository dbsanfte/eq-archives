correction:
it was not the bearskin potion bag, it was the tailored large bag.  i also
made one of these but i did it right before i left the game so didn't have
time to check.  i guess i'll have to check again tomorrow.  but i would
still like to know how (or if it is even possible to) make magic items with
tailoring.

sorry for the miscommunication.
