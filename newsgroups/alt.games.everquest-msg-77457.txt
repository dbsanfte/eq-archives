Hunh? That is crazy. Before I'd do that I'd make it the guild NUMBER
ONE JOB to power level that 39 cleric to 49. Sorry, but I don't want
my epic wielding high level clerics in my guild to take 50 percent xp
resses when I want them to either level or to remain level 60.

yep, good advice. As a druid with 2 or 3 casters to heal I've let
casters actually die in order to chloroblast the MT before a complete
heal chain had a chance to hit him. Several other druids were doing
the same thing. You can't heal the MT "too much", the entire raid
depends on that guy not dying. The instant he dies even if you have
backup ones its often all over since there is a reason why that guy
was the MT.

yep, people do have to potty though sometimes ;)
I've seen uber guilds who had no afk rules but unless they all have
catheters or something I don't get it. Paying attention and not
complaining are a huge part of a raid.
