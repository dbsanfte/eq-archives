> What's the difference between PC2100 and PC1600 memory?


From the Mushkiin web site:What is PC1600 DDR SDRAM?

   PC1600 is the common name for the JEDEC specification for 184pin DDR
(Double Data Rate) SDRAM which runs at a 100MHz bus speed (200MHz double
data rate). Rather than continue with traditional naming conventions and
call the memory PC200, nomenclature has been adapted to reflect the data
rate of the memory in MB/second, in this case 1600 MB/sec (1.6GB/sec).
PC1600 DDR is designed to be used with processors which run at a core
frequency of 100MHz. Unlike standard SDRAM motherboards which allowed one to
run the memory asynchronously where the CPU could be at 100MHz while the
memory was at 133MHz, most DDR motherboards run the memory at the same FSB
as the CPU.

      PC1600 uses "DDR-200" chips which is a catchall bin for 100MHz DDR
chips at any CAS latency. Mushkin's PC1600 DDR SDRAMs are programmed for CAS
2.5-3-3 latency via the SPD (serial presence detect) EEPROM. Please consult
our DDR mainboard qualification page to see a list of chipsets which have
been approved as compatible with our DDR modules. We have selected a series
of popular mainboards to represent each chipset.



      What is PC2100 DDR SDRAM?


      DDR (double data rate) SDRAM is the latest evolution in random access
memory (RAM) technology. All SDRAM operates on a system frequency or "bus"
speed measured in mega hertz (MHz). Traditional SDRAM used only the rising
edge of the clock cycle to transfer data. The new DDR SDRAM transfers data
on both the rising and falling edge of the clock. PC2100 is the common name
for the JEDEC specification for DDR which runs on a 133MHz bus speed (266MHz
double data rate). The chips themselves are named in a more conventional way
as "DDR-233" where the name reflects their MHz speed, the modules however
are named for the effective data transfer of 2100 MB/sec (2.1 GB/sec) on a
64-bit bus.

      PC2100 DDR uses either DDR-266a or DDR-266b chips. The DDR-266a chips
are the fastest bin rated for CAS2 operation at 266MHz, we use those on our
High Performance DDR SDRAM and our 512mb Special DDR SDRAM. DDR-266B chips
are rated for CAS2.5 at 266MHz operation. The chips on our Special DDR are
rated DDR-266b (except for the 512mb Special DDR). These modules are
programmed for CAS 2.5-3-3 operation at 266MHz via the serial presence
detect (SPD) EEPROM. PC2100 DDR is designed for use with CPUs which run on a
133MHz FSB (266MHz DDR). Although the increase in bus speed from 200MHz to
266MHz does translate to an increase in performance, a much larger gain
comes from using DDR which runs at lower latencies. If the fastest possible
performance from your system is important to you, we recommend using our
High Performance DDR with the lower latencies.
