That just ices it for me.  The SOE Gods have gone too far.  I buy the game from
them and pay  them a monthly fee and then  they change the ground rules for my
Druid at 55?  Or my Monk at 38? No thank you. The arrogant pricks.

PoP it seems to me is primarily oriented toward the high end game but, they
have made it an excruiatingly slow process for the *average* payer to get
there.  They want to nerf the game? Reduce NPC AC and HPs by 10 percent or
more; allow the casual player (most of the EQ player universe) to level  level,
don't penalize a peep becuase Soloing is his preferred mode of playing or  lose
the player base.

I have yet to buy PoP as I am seriously considering dropping EQ totally.
