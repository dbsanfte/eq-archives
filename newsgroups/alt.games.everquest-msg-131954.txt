Basically the setting determines how much of your system RAM the video 
card can use for storing textures. When AGP came out this was supposed 
to be a great thing, but in practice the performance was still rather 
poor because of the bottleneck between the AGP bus and the FSB. So if 
your video card has enough RAM (64MB or more for high detail Luclin 
textures) you don't need to worry about this, otherwise set it to 64MB 
and that should be enough.
