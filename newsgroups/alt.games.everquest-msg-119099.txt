I love Agent with a passion that is disturbing to even me.  I use to
as my main Newsreader AND email client.  Two main things about it for
me are 1) No friggin HTML (HTML in email is like giving a Tourettes
suffer a bullhorn), and 2) It can be layed out so you don't have to us
a friggin pane view.

Anyway, Agent can be a little duanting to a real internet newbie, but
to anybody with even a little expericance its not all that hard to
master.
