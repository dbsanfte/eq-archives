I did check as listed below, this quest is still active.  Giving the bag of
bread loaves to Morpa (sp?) did in crease my faction with oggok merchants,
guards and with clurg, plus 2pp 4gp.  But, since I hunted in Runnyeye for a few
days and only saw like 3 bags of bread, it is an impractical way to increase
Oggok faction unless your really desperate.
