LO

I trying to buy EQ over in the UK, does anybody know where I can buy
it!
Ive scoured shops etc and cant find it, mail order places dont seem to
stock it and cant order it and the link to buy EQ from
www.everquest.com want to charge me $80 to ship it over the Atlantic
on top of the $40 to buy it :(

Any Help Greatly Appreciated
