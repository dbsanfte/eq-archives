My assertion already conceded that its -mathematically- possible, so no 
points there :D

I pointed at the practical problem of driving 3' apart (and the implied 
perfectly synchronous driving required to maintain that). Your solution 
-would- eliminate the 3' apart, but would require driving almost just as 
perfect.

While it would prevent the 'waves' in the reality your solution would 
still have an internal ripple effect.

The interesting part however, is that your solution wouldn't actually 
increase the flow of traffic. Car 100 would start -really- slow, and 
accelerate really slow... instead of waiting 2 minutes and accelerating 
at normal speed. Net difference is none.
