Well, yeah.  That was the plan for my Druid's only trip to PoN

thus far.  It turns out that combining a "hare" who doesn't
know the local pathing, a group of pet handlers who are equally
ignorant, and several other groups roaming hither and yon with
their kites, doesn't work very well at all.  And that's putting
it as nicely as I can.  Even if it had gone well tho, I doubt
I'd be much interested in going back.  I find kiting to be the
worst sort of boring there is, nothing interesting happens but
you have to pay attention all the time, it's got to be the most
unfun way to grind xp there is (and that's saying something).
