I would recomend going into everfrost and hunting mammoths all the way
to 29. The experiance rocks and the tusk sell for 6 - 10 plat
depending on the vendor and your chr. Take only 1 bag to store food
and drink in with you and leave all your other slots open because the
tusks wont stack. Then just snare, fear dot, and beat on them. You
might also be able to find an enchanter fighting Ice giants to give ya
clarity and insight which makes for little downtime.

I made 500 plat and 2 levels last weekend and should hit 29 by this
sunday.

Peace
