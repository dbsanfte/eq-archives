Is it that much of a difference?

I am looking at getting my resists from 92 Cold, 47 Fire up to 100+ on both
of them.

Will I seriously be better off going in at 56 with 92 Cold, 47 Fire than
going in at level 55 with 100+ on both?

I am pretty sure I can hit those resists fast now having done a bit more
research, just have to buy up some components, and get a mage summoned item
or two for the raid, so actually, looks like it won't have to take a
backseat after all.  But I am still curious about just how much of a
difference level makes vs resists.
