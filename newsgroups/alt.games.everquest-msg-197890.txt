There might actually be some validity to this. Quite a while ago,
there was a problem on Bristlebane where the spawn times in L Guk
suddenly changed to 40+ minutes. After a couple of months, it was
fixed and the loggon message gave the reasons for the problem as
faulty hardware that overloaded the zone, and the first thing that the
server did to compensate was to spawn mobs more slowly. 

Given that same logic, take a newbie zone like G Fey on day one of a
server opening, overload the zone with 200 players, add a shitload of
unlooted corpses and it _might_ be possible that mobs will spawn more
slowly.
