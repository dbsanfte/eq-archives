I've recently started playing EverQuest again after a long absence and am
enjoying my return. I left just before Kunark and left behind a level 21
Barb Shaman. Somehow my character survived all those years away and I'm back
on the same account and have been able to start playing again (hit 24 in
Paludal Caverns my 2nd night back!) without starting over as a complete
newbie (well, ok, I'm still a newbie, just not a level 1 newbie which means
that I don't have to kill rats anymore, yay!). I bought all of the
expansions so I'm really enjoying the new graphics, UI and benefits of PoK,
etc.

I notice there's a new premium service called "Legends" and although it
seems expensive, the feature list sounds very intriguing. That is, if
there's actually critical mass on the servers. I'm thinking primarily of the
advantages of playing with a more serious crowd, fewer annoying characters,
more adventures, and perhaps other advantages. First question: is this
realistic or am I fantasizing? Does the quality of the playing field
actually improve with the higher investment required, or do morons still
flood the chat channels with rants about KS'ing, etc.?

Second question, are there many players playing in this world? So far I
haven't had trouble finding groups for my little 24 Shaman, but it's
borderline with everyone 50+. I gotta think the Legends world is even
slimmer pickens and since anyone can move their characters over, it seems
even more likely to be top heavy.

Thoughts?
