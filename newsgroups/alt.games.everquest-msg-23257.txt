That's the funniest part in the entire exchange:  Bizbee
frequently feels the need to post over-the-top flames
at countless targets, tells people not to breed and it's
too bad the target's father had bred, etc. etc..

But the moment I point out that he over-flames at times,
and he asks me to cite examples and I do so, he goes
ballistic, whines that I'm not being fair, and killfiles me.

I've never seen a more stark example of "can dish it out
but can't take it".

You'd think he'd realize that if he's going to flame,
he'd better be willing to field return fire, *or* if he
can't stand to have people criticize his posts, then
he ought to extend others the same courtesy.

Anything else is not only hypocritical, but pathetic
as well.

And to add to the pathetic-quotient, after killfiling
me, he has now spent several posts making childish
snipes like "I would respond to this post, but I
wouldn't want Danny to accuse me of flaming again"
(how ironic).

He's apparently not mature enough to realize if he
killfiles someone to avoid further conflict, it's
puerile for him to keep sniping from behind the
"safety" of his killfile.

I had actually gained a lot of respect for Bizbee
over the past several months (the vast majority of my
responses to his posts had been friendly and even
complimentary), but then he goes and starts acting
like a first-grader again.

Sigh.

I don't know what his problem is, but he clearly
has one, and for his own peace of mind, I hope he
learns how to deal with it.
