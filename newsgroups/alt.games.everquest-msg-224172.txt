Pay attention to how the messages come in.  People forming groups seldom use
/say because it's so short-ranged.  If you see in your chatbox "Rhian shouts
'Forming a group, levels 6 to 12' everyone in the zone hears it, and if you
just type 'hey Rhian I'm interested' then unless I'm standing next to you I
won't hear it.  Try typing "/tell Rhian I'm a level 5 warrior, where do  you
want to meet up?'" you're much more likely to get a response.  If you want
the whole zone to hear your comments, use /shout or /ooc.

And whatever you do - if you want to be taken seriously, try, try, please
TRY to avoid dewd l33t sp34k.
