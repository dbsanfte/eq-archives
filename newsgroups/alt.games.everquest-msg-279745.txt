"Added"?  That part was there whether it was explicitly stated or not, at
least for anyone with a modicum of intelligence and common sense.

WoW won't exactly get harder as the game matures and the twinking/power
leveling reach EQ proportions.  =P

There are plenty who do, though few who do it completely without twinking at
all.  It is frighteningly obvious that you haven't legitimately leveled in a
long time.  I'm known for my ego, but your egocentric blinders astound even
me.

Or, to put it another way, it took me about as much actual time to get from
65 to 70 when OoW was released as it took me to get from zero to 60 in WoW
when it was released, and in EQ I already had good gear, a working knowledge
of the game, etc.

Without doubt EQ is more time consuming.  Equally without doubt, EQ is a
*harder* game.  In WoW, as I mentioned, one can play with reckless abandon
and not only never lose ground, but actually advance at a frenetic pace.  In
EQ, playing with reckless abandon, unless you are playing in areas far below
your power level, is a recipe for disaster.

I like cheese.
