As many have said...  WHY OH WHY are you running OUT of a zone with a bank,
across 3 zones to bank in gnomeville? unless you are KOS in Kelethin and
felwithe, EITHER of those is closer than the route you have chosen.

As an Aside, Druids don't port to steamfont to bank... at least not if they
have circle of Misty Thicket.
