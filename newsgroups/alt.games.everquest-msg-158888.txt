I'm in serious need of armor upgrades so heading to kael would be for that
reason and that reason only. I've heard that the gaurds at the arena
entrance drop the quest armor peices and so that would be my target.  My
brother (54 Warrior) and I (55 Shaman) would be the only two going.  I know
I could slow these mobs and that I could ghettomez the add (I know I'll get
two gaurds on pull no matter what) and I'm sure we could handle the two
alone.  Question is, if for some reason we have to run because it's just too
much for us at some point or somebody trains us, do the giants run faster
than Run1?  Thanks for any info possible.
