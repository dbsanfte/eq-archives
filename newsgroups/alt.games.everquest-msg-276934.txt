Against the EULA. Not against the game's rules.

That said: Kill stealing is prohibited in modern MMORPGs by "locking"
mobs; bad language is often caught by swear filters etc. So some
elements of this are entering game rules as well. For instance in WoW
you cannot train mobs on someone, because once they get tired of
chasing you they run back to where they were before you pulled them.

It's not irrelevant, because this entire tirade has roots in whether a
purchased item gives someone an unfair advantage over others, i.e.
"cheating". And it does not: That item could just as well have been
obtained by the character through "normal" means, camping, questing,
whatever. The item is in the game, after transfer one character has
it, the other doesn't.

And items follow in-game rules, so they are relevant.

And I say there are differences between the EULA (governing player
actions) and the rules that affect what the characters and their
equipment can do.

Obtaining an item through the game's built-in trade system is not
against the rules. The external money being transferred is.

The point was that buying that sword does not give your character any
"extra" abilities (which would have been cheating in the "extra queens
on chessboard" sense). That was the point of my remark about wielding
the purchased sword in addition to whatever you already used.

*sigh* It's not a sword, it's data in a database that was added when
the first player had done a time-consuming act completed the act.
Getting the "sword" is a consequence of spending that time. No other
resource is part of obtaining the "sword".

The person buying the sword now does not have to spend that time, so
that is in effect what he is buying. Catasses versus casuals and all
that. You can compare it to the difference between golfers who walk
(takes time) versus those that use golf carts (saves time, costs
money).

But reading different books.

Car theft is very different from license violations. What "argument"
are you looking for? You made no argument worth countering, but an
irrelevant comparison.

> Can you see the difference? 

Yes, the exchange of money outside the game is against the EULA. The
exchange of the item, IN ISOLATION, is not against the rules, and DOES
NOT give any advantages that can be considered "cheating". For
instance, it's common for players who quit the game to give away stuff
from their characters - should that be banned as well?

> So what makes EQ different? Why do you figure its ok to cheat in EQ?

The exchange of items is not cheating! If it was, the game would not
have player-to-player trade built in. This is why really powerful
items often are non-tradable: The GAME RULES want the player to invest
the required time to get it.
