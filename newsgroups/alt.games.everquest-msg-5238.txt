Must be different to DeVir on Bristlebane, I've seen them shouting for new
members in EC, only requirement there was being a DE, at least thats how it
appeared.
Not saying they're not all great guys, erm ok I am I had a mouthful abuse
from one of them of, apparently I'm a moron who shouldn't play the game as I
wouldn't pay 900pp for a SMALL crafted BP, I was dumb because Small is
obviously more desirable, eh? Plus, it also costs more to get it reduced in
size, double eh?  I may be a moron but certainly not for the reasons given
:ï¿½)
The rest seem ok tho.

I am certain they'd understand, maybe inventing a story line for it if they
are really into role-playing. It'd be better for you to let them know why
you have vanished from the face of norrath.
Only thing I can see as a problem is they may ask you to get to 10th before
allowing you back in the guild but leveling to ten is pretty quick when you
do it a second time around.
