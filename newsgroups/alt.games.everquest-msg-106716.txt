A little bit OT but what the hey...I'm telling everyone...read on :)

Last night (April 15 2002), myself (51 ranger) and some guildies
(including a 55 ranger) went to CoM.  The entire group was: 51, 55
Rangers.  54 Warr, 52 Rogue, 52 Chanter and 50 Cleric.

We got to the reaver part, and after clearing up inside, we pulled
one. Bingo! It dropped a JR straight away. Never heard of that before.
It had been previously decided that the 55 ranger would get the first
JR as he was closer to finishing his epic than I was. Anyway...up pops
a second reaver...we kill it...and you'd never guess what it dropped?

That's right, folks...a second JR! I'm still grinning like a Cheshire
cat while typing this, I can tell you!

Tzen, 51 ranger and proud owner of a Jade Reaver!
