Just to play Devil's advocate here, your statement that computer
gaming has never been cheap, it always requires a higher end system to
keep up with the latest games, is not true.  This, in fact, did not
occur until the birth of Microsoft, and the then dominance of IBM and
their PC line of computers.  And even then, machines with supposedly
much lesser specs far outperformed the PC's and MS OS's in game
performance. (read Atari, Apple AND Commodore)

Now, to get back to reality, because the Intel standard and Microsoft
have become the defacto dominating forces in the market, you, and
everyone else is exactly right.  Upgrading is a way of life, and will
be for a still undetermined amount of time.  95, while definately
groundbreaking (unless, of course, if one compared it to already
existing Mac OS's) is well past its' prime. 98 is getting very close,
but, for a Microsoft product, built on a dinosaur shell, it is rock
solid stable if properly tuned... a great gaming OS.  When it comes
right down to it, the ONLY reason someone should be running 95 is if
they are on a 486 or older system, and only because they won't run 98
properly.

As for hardware upgrades, no, it isn't gumball machine money, but $50
for a GeForce MX card won't break the bank either... and I know that,
at least in the US, you can get PC133 256mb SDRAM for as little as $25
retail (with rebate) from both CompUSA and Best Buys on any given
weekend.  And I paid a whole $35 for my Duron 700 chip at a local
computer show a year ago... far less than I ever paid for my first
Seagate ST128 drive (a whopping 10mb hd, retailed for $700 when it hit
the streets, got a deep discount of $400 on it )

And lets face it... if you can plunk down $30 for an expansion, plus
however much you put into the original and other expansions, and then
spend $120 a year to play, complaining about an OS upgrade or hardware
upgrade costing too much is about as meaningful as farting in the
wind...
