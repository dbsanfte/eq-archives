There is a big difference between network lag and video lag.  If you're 
really experiencing a network lag problem, you should see very high ping 
times, and most likely packetloss.  If you're not seeing that, it's most 
likely video lag, which could be caused by a number of issues, but is 
likely related to your computer.
Do a ctrl-alt-del and see what programs are running.  On my win98 EQ box 
(pII-400, 384meg RAM, GeForce2 200) I only have Explorer and Systray 
running, compared to 15-20 programs for most people.  I can run Luclin 
well with about 1/2 new models and low textures.  I have very little video 
lag, so Verant must not hate me.  :)  Seriously, check your OS, see what 
other applications are running, especially on your work box.
