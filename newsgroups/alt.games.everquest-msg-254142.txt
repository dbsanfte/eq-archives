This may have been their reasoning. However in the instance I'm
referring to we were in PoI at the entrance. It was a judgment call on
their part, but I think it was a bad call. I was keeping a group going
in PoI for several hours with lots of turn over (a raiding night, I
suppose) we were doing very well with only an occasional death
(chanter once, and myself once) but there was a world of difference in
the different tanks/pullers we had.

This happened a while back.

The instance I was referring to with the snare, was a SK who was the
main tank at the time, refused to use the snare because it would slow
down pulls. This would not have been a big problem, except those mobs
in PoI hit HARD. Since it took a little while before the SK got agro,
I couldn't slow them immediately. (He would try to cast darkness on
the mob once it arrived, but he was getting interrupted a lot.) Which
meant that the SK was loosing a lot of health before I could get one
to stick. In some cases when I'd get a resist or two, I'd have to wait
even longer before I could make a second attempt. In many cases it the
mob was down to 30% with our high DPS group before I could get one to
stick, which meant the low level cleric had to cast several heals to
keep the tank alive during the battle. The net effect was that we were
having to slow down pulls anyway for the cleric to regain mana. Since
the mobs in PoI (at least the ones we were fighting) don't run, there
was no point in not snaring them with darkness. Of course, on those
occasions where the MT was going down in life too fast and I simply
had to cast my slows too quickly, I would get agro, and in one case I
died.

Contrast that with a guldie SK I would do small groups with all the
time. He would snare the mob as it was pulled, or if someone else was
pulling would snare it before it arrived in camp. (He would even snare
the mobs in PoI on the pull, which definitely made the longer pulls
take a while to get to the group.) This slowed down the pulls, but
meant that I could slow, malo, cripple, and dot the mob, while the
other casters (and paper melee) could go whole hog as well, which made
it drop faster, which meant we could go after the next mob that much
faster. (and consequently made the cleric use less mana)

*shrug* I'm sure that there are legitimate reasons for not using a
snare on the pull, and if the net effect is positive, I have no
problem with it. Problem is in the cases I'm referring to the net
effect was not positive. In many cases, the tanks don't think outside
their narrow field of view or take in to consideration what the other
members have to do to deal with their lack of agro. As I said matter
of skill and also of knowledge.

Again, there are reasons that someone might legitimately take these
tactics. There are a lot of tactics that people might take in
particular circumstances, that would be utter stupidity under normal
conditions.

Again a particular instance, the revolving PoI group I mentioned
earlier. The main tank was selected because he was a Pally, and all
the other melees we had were a monk and a ranger. Obviously the Pally
should be taking the brunt of the damage. (Indeed I asked him to join
as MT, which he did not express any reservations to.) Now he may
legitimately had reason for concern due to the previously mentioned
hard hitting mobs in PoI, but if he would have just got agro with a
few stuns I could have slowed the mob before it chewed through 1/2 his
hit points. As it was the agro kept ping ponging between him, the monk
(who would promptly FD), the ranger (who took considerable damage
before we could get the mob off of him), the cleric (! because he had
to heal him so often), the wizard (luckily it only happened once, and
the ranger was able to pull the mob off of him before he died), and me
(because with the alarming rate his HP were going down I needed to
Slow the mobs ASAP).

Apparently he was not all that well equipped, because he was taking a
lot of damage, and he apparently didn't trust the cleric's ability to
keep him alive. (Witness several occasions where the Pally went to
less than 10% HP.) However, if he had just listened to me and stunned
the damn mobs a few times, I could have slowed, crippled, dotted, and
even maloed the mob for the wizard, without getting agro. I know this,
because one of my guldies is a Pally. While she is significantly
higher level than he, and better equipped (though not uber equipped,
after all she was unguilded until she joined us, and we aren't a
raiding guild) she would stun the mobs a few times, and I could do
what ever I needed to, and the cleric was always FM. Though the pally
would have to med every few fights to get her mana back (she didn't
have any mind candy). This slowed down the pulls, but was a lot safer,
and we could have our guldie SK take over tank duties while she
medded.

Back to the PoI group I mentioned originally. We only had one bad
Pally, and two bad SK's (one of which listened to me and started
snaring) and the other tank/pullers we had were just fine. Which is
why this particular day stands out in my memory as a contrast between
good handling of agro and bad.
