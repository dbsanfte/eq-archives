The need for new content at low levels has been mentioned by players
on the official EQ forums as a way to attract new players. The
Drakkin/Crescent Reach/TSS was the one expansion to do that. The
rest have all been for toons over 60th level. 

Oh yeah, they changed the UI to 'attract new players'. Thats just
sad. But it did get me to start using an interface from
eqinterface.com
