That's a great idea if it was that easy.  When I played EQ2 I spent
hours with the LFG flag on.  Or shouting in a zone for group members.
I'd say an hour spent soloing is an hour better spent than the hour
spent shouting for group members.

The game isn't about other players - its about what EVERY game is
about.  Its about having fun.  I agree that the presence of other
players and the interaction with them can greatly improve that fun, but
they are just a means to an end.  The end being fun.

IMO, group experience debt isn't a detrimental feature.  Its a group
effort and the group should work to keep all its members alive.  The
experience debt HELPS the person who died by splitting the debt between
the whole group.  It doesn't add up to much unless there are only a few
people in the group - this should be encouraging larger groups.

I agree with this - the player doesn't always know what is best for the
game.  People have a problem soloing when they can't find a group and
so they assume soloing should be made more fun - a better solution
would possibly be to make groups easier to find.
