I'm wondering if anybody can help me to find a merchant in SH or the Bazaar
that sells Pumice stones and cloudy potions.
Spent an hour or so last night looking to no avail.
Also couldn't find anyone selling throwing stars.
In the end I had to port back to Cabilis via nexus and it took me an hour
all up.
