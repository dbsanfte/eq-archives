Hmm, you might want to try kiting HG's in Rathe Mountains.

It's rather simple, druid snares a giant, pisses it off REAL good then
starts running circles.
The warrior hits it from behind and backs off whenever he gets aggro (don't
taunt, the war doesn't want aggro) and the druid nukes / dots to get it's
attention again.


Aside from that I'm not so familiar with cash spots around those levels. I
mostly leveled asap till 34 or so in SK then went to velious (IC, EW, CC,
GD, all good hunting zones around that level).
