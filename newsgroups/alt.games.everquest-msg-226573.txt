I'm often grouped with a paladin and I love having one around. You're
tied with SK as the best tank in the game for exp groups, have heals
that complement a shaman or druid well (admittedly people don't pick a
pally for healing in a group) and you can rez so a group doesn't need
a cleric. What's there not to like? <g>
