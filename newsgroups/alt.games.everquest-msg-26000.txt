Last time I checked I was glares (I don't know if you start off scowling)
with 161 +Yelinak faction hits (mostly from doing Emil's report quest - bind
in SS, gate to WL, find Eysa, gate back, rinse and repeat ad nauseum until
someone kills Emil).

Used to be that the armour quest mobs were on Yelinak faction but now they
are all on CoV, so I'm not sure there is any point any more. Not like you
can accidentally run into him while roaming SS...
