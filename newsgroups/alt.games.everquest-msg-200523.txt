Gotta be alert for your opportunities also.  Sometimes the Cleric gets
to nuke situationally, especially at lower level.  Playing in a lo/mid
20s group in LOIO (Stromm server, no twinks) the other day the Warrior
brought in a big overpull.  So my Druid DS'd Warrior, DS'd self, and
stepped into the melee chain healing the Warrior until I had agro, then
chain healing myself.  The Cleric, an alert veteran player, realized
what I was up to the moment I DS'd myself (I'm not a speed typer, was
depending on Cleric to know not to heal on the pull as I did not have
time to explain) and started nuking as soon as my first heal landed on
the Warrior.  With everybody assisting off the Warrior the mobs went
down fast and as my Defense and Channelling are maxed I never fell
below 40% health.  Was great fun.

But don't fall asleep!  And remember, everybody loves you.  ;)
