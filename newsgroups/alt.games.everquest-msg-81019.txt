That's what you get for trying a price guide that's
on the web instead of your own server's auction
guide.

Pick can go for 400-1000 on E. Marr.  Decent
damage, non-magical, common as all
get-out.

Shaded Dagger can sell for 4000-6000.  It
would be even more if the Sv. vs Fire wasn't
a -5.  11/22 is a great main hand weapon,
but absolutely rocks and rolls off-hand, too.
Feel sorry for the idjits with a Trak Tooth
main and this off-hand now (Trak Tooth is
main only...would suck to have your better
damage dealer off-hand :-)  ).  It looks like
a Walrus tooth, which is also kinda neat.

Sharpened Velium spear, with the same
exact damage/delay as the Shaded Dagger,
and NO OTHER STATS will go for 10-14 kpp.
Why? It looks uber as well as being a good
weapon.  You get 90% of the functionality of
the shaded dagger, and you get to have folks
think you're in some uber guild at the same
time, and get to answer lots of gear questions
(which seems kinda dumb to me, but I don't
have extra 10's of kpp to throw around, either).

Jagged Ice Shard is almost the same as
the Mining pick, with an additional 60 pt
DD proc at level 48.  It generally goes for about
3-4 kpp more than the Pick for a couple of
reasons.  It's not the proc (which is really  nice
with a higher level character...that proc is like
another free piercing attack ), it's for the way it
looks, and the fact that it's magical.
