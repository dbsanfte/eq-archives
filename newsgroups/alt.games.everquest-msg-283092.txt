Would anyone be willing to help out a poor college student studying
MMOs? :)

I'm currently seeking people over the age of 18 who have had dreams
related to MMOs. If you have ever dreamed that you were in the game or
that parts of the game were in your real life, then I would like to ask
you some questions about your experiences. Your information and
responses will be kept confidential.

If you are willing to be interviewed about your thoughts on this topic,
please email me at eqearlgrey@yahoo.com.

Alternatively, you can help me out by taking this 10-minute survey.

I appreciate your contribution to my research. At the conclusion of my
project, I will post a link to my paper, as well as the papers of my
classmates. For more details about our course and the research project,

Thanks in advance for your time.
