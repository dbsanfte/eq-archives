Some of us just get a bit worried when the tank falls down to 10% or 5%
health, and that CHeal has not landed yet, so yes, we do toss on a quick
heal.  Given that my quick heal is all of 428hp, it's not going to
significantly impact the efficiency of a cleric CH.  Only times I use my
gimp CH is when I am main healer, or when the cleric is lom, and I have
discussed it with him.
