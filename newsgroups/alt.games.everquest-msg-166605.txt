Funny, I know a LOT of people that find it extremely easy to RP in EQ.
The fact that people choose not to RP in the game doesn't mean it's
not a fantasy RP, nor does it mean it's not geared toward RP. The
problem isn't with the game, frankly. The problem is with YOU.

Honestly, no computer game will ever manage to make the "ideal" RP
environment. Well, not while still being enjoyable to play except in
certain situations, that is.
