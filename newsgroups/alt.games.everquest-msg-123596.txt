The OS that I have heard the least number of complaints about for running EQ
is Win98.  I'm not talking about which OS is best to run on your computer in
general, but rather, which on is best to run for EQ specifically.  That
being said, I run Win2k, sound problems and all, because it is by far the
most reliable Windoze I have ever used.  I have not upgraded to XP yet
because I have had no reason to move away from Win2k.  Others have
complained here about issues with XP and sound, and I know 2k has sound
issues.  Windows me, well, I don't hear much disagreement about staying away
from that one.
