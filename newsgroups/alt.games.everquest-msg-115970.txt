It is a personal choice....

Some monks will train all of their skills to max as they level. The
only advantage to this is personal satisfaction. Dragon Punch is used
post 50 with one of the monk disciplines (Ashen Hand), so if you plan
on taking your monk that high you will want to keep it maxed once you
acquire the skill.

For the most efficient fighting you will want to use the attack with
the best damage to delay ratio (just like a weapon). Once you get
Flying Kick (30 or 35 I can't remember offhand) you will use it the
most. It hits hard and has a decent refresh time.
