I'm curious what classes can handle fairly large camps solo.

I just watched a 53 Bard take pretty much all the lowest level flies in POD
at once.  As a 60 Wizard whose mana pool is not quite deep enough to quad
there safely, I can make a dent of about 3 in the fly population.  If I
could quad, it's possible I could keep 8 cleared.

Earlier, I had checked the Tro Jeg camp on top of the mesa in SD, and one 65
Enchanter had killed everything on the mesa.  I can keep about three or four
mobs clear here, non-quadding.
