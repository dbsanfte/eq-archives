Is she the Necro in EFp sewers? If so... BWAHAHA! (j/k)

Solo against non-healing casters...
MR buff, root, dot, dot, Wind Nuke (knockback will prolly break root, but
will also interrupt his casting) root... retreat and wait for wind nuke to
recycle.

Solo against healers...
MR buff, wind nuke, snare, wind nuke, fire nuke, repeat until dead... as
fast as you can take him down.

Solo against pet class caster...
MR buff, snare pet, wind nuke caster, summon-nuke pet, root caster, dot
caster, dot caster, drag pet out of casters range and try to kill it before
root breaks... then treat caster as non-healer.

If you're Feared or Charmed... just suck it up. If you have to, retreat and
med up before trying again.

If there's one available, try charming your own greenie animal and set it on
the caster (interrupts caster, and distracts his pet)

If you suspect you'll be Dispelled... load up Fire, Cold, Disease and Poison
buffs first.. then Enduring Breath, Strength Buff, Thistle/Spike line
Armour, Skin Like X, MR buff.
SoW/WolfForm goes last... if he can dispell thru to your Skin Like X before
you kill him, it might be your last chance to zone.

Although WHY you're still trying to solo casters instead of quadding
helpless melee critters is beyond me ;o)
