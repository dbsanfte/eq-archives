While EQ can be made to run on linux, its not exactly the simplest thing 
in the world.

If I bought programY for windows, and it was patched and stopped 
working. I would expect programY's developers to fix the problem and 
issue a new patch. We all would. In fact, ideally we would never even 
see the buggy version because it would be contained by developerY's in 
house testing.

If Sony breaks EQ for Transgamings Winex (now Cedega) then its up to 
Transgaming to play catch up, and fix it. This model of software 
maintenance is inherently far less reliable. We -know- there is no 
testing against winex in advance of patch releases, so the liklihood of 
'emergency damage control' by Transgaming is inevitable, with no 
expectation it can even be prevented.

As long as SOE doesn't test with transgaming, the linux support of EQ 
will be inherently less reliable than the Windows version.

That said, Transgaming is doing a marvelous job at letting us choose our 
OSes on their own merits without being quite so constrained by the 
respective software libraries.
