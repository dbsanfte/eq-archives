Hi folks,

Just thought i'd give this a try befor my account disappears. I have an EQ
account...that I am no longer interested in keepng. As of now...my account
is not payed up..and I have 3 months left to re-activate it.
here's what I have (on Quellious server).

52 necromancer with some decent stuff
46 Rogue (only few items...rest is on ranger further down)
46 Beastlord with some decent stuff...including Tarmok battlestaff.
36 Ranger with Wurmslayer....Centi Longsword....some decent gear on him as
well...(barb tunic, hard clay bracer...silver chitin handwraps...lots of
stuff)
20 Druid some newbie stuff....most spells
18 mage nothing on him
15 warrior few items on him...not much
6 wizzard (froggy) few newbie items on hm as well.

the Necro, Bst and Ranger is in same guild (will have to disband from guild)

Rogue is in another guild (was not active in that guild for long
time...cause i didnt play the rogue no more)

Im sure that this wil be looked on as a scam im sure....but if i dont sell
this account, i'm just giving it to a friend at work (his wife plays...and
she would like to have it)

I also have a 29 Beastlord on Veeshan server (he on guild as well...some
friends of mine actually)

I am located in Sudbury, Ontario if anyone in local area reads this and want
to e-mail me for more info.

that said....matters not to me if i get an offer or not...as....I am getting
rid of the account  one way or another.

I can be reached at alvinfelix1@sympatico.ca

thank you for your're concideration :-)
Alvin Felix
