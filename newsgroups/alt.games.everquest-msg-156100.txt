No I'm sorry but your the one that don't know what your talking about.

Before the patch,

Ranger:
Dodge 170
Defense 220
Parry 220
Riposte 150

Paladin
Dodge 155
Defense 252
Parry 205
Riposte 200

Monk
Dodge 230
Defense 252
Block 230
Riposte 225


Add to this the fact that higher level monks usually had a lot more AC
(thanks to natural AC being very high) than the ranger or even paladin could
ever hope to get from equipment.  (If you don't believe me then just go
check the magelo profile system for some)

The monk took way less damage per second than anyone save a warrior.

I have tanked the same mobs with my ranger (now level 54) as I did with the
monk and the difference was huge.

Most higher level people I know saw this change coming.

Also look at this from :

"In addition to my ranger main (55), I have a monk alt (50). He doesn't get
played near as much, and his gear is *very* mediocre.
.....
Ok, here was the results: My monk had 970 AC, and my ranger 950 AC. Now what
the heck!?!? My monk who is 6 levels lower with 1/10 the money invested and
inferior armor has more AC than my ranger?!?!? I also noticed that my monk
got hit MUCH less often for overall less per damage per hit. So this tells
me that they have different mitigation and avoidance abilities than rangers.
They also get higher skill caps in their defensive skills.

So overall, my monk was arguably a better tank than my ranger despite being
quite a bit lower in level and under-equipped. I could take my monk into KC
and get a group and not get any laughs when someone ask that I be the main
tank. My ranger, 6 levels higher and better equipped, would get laughed at
if someone suggested it.... and they had due cause. To this day my ranger
can still get his butthole chewed by a regular ol' xp group pull.

I can remember a time when my monk died and had to run across DL back to KC
naked... got jumped by a drolvarg gnasher (I know not an extremely hard
mob), and just for kicks I engaged him NAKED to see how long I'd last with
monk innate defense and my fists. I KILLED it. Naked. Completely naked and
using a mend. I was *maybe* level 45 at the time and the mob was dark blue
to me.... "
