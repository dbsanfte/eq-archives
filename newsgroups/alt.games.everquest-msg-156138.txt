Yeah im starting to think its more about my preference really as necros 
in general are an overpowered class
Why is it that gnomes are not kos in as many places as erudites then?
Anyone know the order from most to least kos for each of the necro 
races?
Would humans be the least kos? then maybe gnomes? with iksars as the 
worst followed by erudites maybe?
Can gnomes go through Qeynos without being kos by most npcs including 
the guards? Are they conned as apprehensive?
This post has brought up something i didnt know about necros, i was 
under the impression they were kos everywhere other than maybe the 
nexus, bazaar and there hometown and was interested to find killing the 
gnolls in bb will make you non kos in qeynos eventually.
While this makes sense i just though as you were an evil class 
automatically and that this couldnt change by faction alone, im glad to 
see the web site i read this on was wrong
