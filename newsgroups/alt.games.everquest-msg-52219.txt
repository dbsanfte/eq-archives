The middle ground is apathy.

I have no intention of ever buying or selling, for real money, any item or
account in EQ. It is, however, a matter of supreme indifference to me,
whether others choose to do so.

I see it as a victimless crime, and although people have said, that e-bayers
buying lvl 60 accounts are responsible for the deaths of other, similarly
high level characters, I have not seen any evidence that this has happened
with any regularity, or even happened at all.

As I said, it is only an opinion. I think that they say one thing publicly,
but do something quite differently privately.

The main reason for my opinion is, human nature. Would they rather have
someone quit the game and lose the account dollars each month, or would they
have the account sold to someone else and still have the money coming in?

If their (Sony) face is rubbed in it, then they will probably ban an
account, but I don't think they would be spending too much money trying to
find out who has bought accounts and who hasn't. Where would the profit be?
