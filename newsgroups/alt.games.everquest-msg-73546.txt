Hello, 

I was wondering if anyone else has this problem.  Several days ago I noticed the
in-game music began sounding garbled.  Auto-attack sounds horrible, and the
background music hiccups and stutters through thick static.  Oddly enough,
"natural sounds" in the game (insects, footsteps, etc.) seem unaffected.  It is
possible to play EQ without optimal sound, but doing so isn't nearly as nice and
it certainly detracts from the ambience.  Naturally I assumed the problem was on
my end, since I have had numerous problems in the original EQ since the Luclin
expansion.  I asked a friend who plays and he reported having the same sound
problems.  He told me Soundblaster cards (which about are equipped in about 90%
of computers) are now incompatible with EQ.  He made some reference to Verant
"being aware of the problem" but it's been a week now and the sound still sucks.
Does anyone know what's going on here?  Anyone else having these sound problems?
Do y'all think Verant is going to fix this, or is everyone with a soundblaster
card going to have to get a new sound card installed?  That would seem quite
unfair to me personally, since I just dragged my computer to the shop for a RAM
upgrade and a new video card.  At this rate EQ is getting somewhat expensive to
play, but I love it too much to give it up.  Any thoughts out there?
