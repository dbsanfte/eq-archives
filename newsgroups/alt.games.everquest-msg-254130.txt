Hiya, 

  I've got a couple of questions that I can't figure out, none are
really related, hence the somewhat vague title <g>.

First of all, my main just got the 'Health of Target's Target'
leadership AA. Is there a keyboard shotcut to open/close this
targetting window? I can do it by making a hotkey but it gets to be a
pain to explain how to do that in all the groups. I'd prefer to be
able to tell them to press ALT-T (or whatever) to open that window
instead.

Second, my warrior just got his melee discipline at lvl 52, Evasive I
think it's called. From my somewhat limited testing, this seems to act
the same way that I've had defensive explained to me. It seems to cut
both my damage and the damage done to me by about half for 3 minutes
(with a 7 minute recast time).  What exactly are the
advantages/disadvantages of this over the other defensive disciplines,
especially defensive. 

Finally, is there any good info out there on Ferubi? We've spent some
time pulling the sewer part of the zone but haven't ventured out of
that area. Looks like a nice exp zone, at least comparable to Tier3
PoP but kinda boring. 

Are there any named that pop in the sewers? 

Is there an easy way to get out of the sewers to the rest of the zone?
Our one expedition further in brought us to a named mob that sees
invis and had 3 pets. Since it was getting close to the end of the
night and we didn't have anyone with summon corpse, we didn't try him
but I'm wondering whether the rest of the zone is worth exploring for
someone who doesn't raid but does have a regular group capable of
doing hard LDoNs (shaman, cleric, druid, monk, bst, paladin). 

Thanks in advance for any help. 

Rgds, Frank
