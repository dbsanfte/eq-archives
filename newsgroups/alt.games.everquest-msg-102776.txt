It's a pay site, but on the front page if you click "map listing by zone" on
the right hand bar, you can see all of their maps, and some of the chardok
ones are fairly high quality fare also.

The first and second maps are kind of crappy; third is good for zone layout
but only has 2 spawns listed, and neither of them are royals (Korocust and
Niblek); fourth is nice design, has royals on it (though queen isn't quite
right); fifth is good looking and has all of the spawns inside the royal
area labelled on it, which is very useful; sixth and seventh are average,
good layout and look, labelled royals but nothing great.

In other words, just go for the fifth set for what you need.

work for the site.
