Are you on a horse by chance? I have had issues with targeting and
casting on my pet when on horseback on a side of a hill. I would have
to dismount to cast the spell. This happened to me in Maidens Eye.

When the pet is damaged in anyway by the mob he will turn back to
attack. If he is doted he will keep re engaging the mob. I have found
that if 2 or more mobs are beating on your dog its pretty tough to get
him to back off.

I think the lvl 44+ pets all duel wield and the lvl 49 and 55 pets are
able to tank for a bit without dying.
