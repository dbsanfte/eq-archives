No, the basis in the problem is in the reasons why people like bin
Laden start their terrorism efforts in the first place. Those reasons
are NOT religious. They are political.

In any event you don't stamp out religious extremism by attacking a
state that has done nothing but fight them while propping up another
state that actively harbors and supports them.

Do you defeat a snake by chopping off his tail bit by bit?

No. You go for the head. The leaders, not the troops. In this case,
that means going after the problems that cause the leaders to rise.
Those reasons are political.

So, to take the analogy further, in the "war on drugs", you believe
its better to focus on the end user instead of the drug makers? That
is what you are arguing here.

The thing is the problem is what caused the fertile ground for Hitler
to arise in the first place. Had Germany not been put in a position
that guaranteed it would arise again in hostility, WW2 may never have
happened.

And so with the Middle East. If the US wasn't sticking their nose
where it wasn't wanted in the name of... whatever they will call their
control of Saudi Arabia and backing of Israel, the fertile ground
would not be there for bin Laden's. Believing it would anyways is
veiled racism.

I hope you are not a doctor, because you are addressing symptoms, not
the disease.

So many people claim that the US doesn't care about the oil there. In
that case, explain why they are there at all, and not in the dozens of
other places in the world in the exact same situation CNN doesn't see
fit to report on?

Propoganda isn't a new concept.

There *was* a choice involved but it was made twenty years earlier,
and France and Britain chose the same solution the US is choosing now
- to try to squelch Germany for the forseeable future.

Twenty years later it sets off a war that was directly responsible for
at least 50 million people killed.

Will history repeat itself? It's still early enough to avoid it. The
same 'choice' has not yet been made. But Bush is going the exact same
direction.

Maybe in 2025 we can talk about this again.

You grossly underestimate the US's role in why they hate you. It
wasn't unilateral.
