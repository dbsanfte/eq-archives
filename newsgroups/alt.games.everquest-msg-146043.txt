The paladin has a lot more to complain about than does the
warrior, here.  I do strongly doubt the part about clerics tanking
(meaning sponging) nearly as well as a paladin, though, with
lower AC, lower HP, lower capped dodge, no parry, no riposte,
a comperably equipped cleric (in terms of uberness that is) is
not going to make any more of a substitute for a sponge than
is a rogue.  CAN you get by with a rogue or cleric as sponge?
Maybe while taking on light blues with a slower on duty... but
they just nerfed light blues as an option!
