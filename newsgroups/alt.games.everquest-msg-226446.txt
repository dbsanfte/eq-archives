    In general, no. Microsoft is your classic example of tying. They bundle
together a million different services in their OS, which discourages
consumers from getting those services from other providers. Why go to many
different vendors to get the same services that one vendor offers? Here at
work, I've turned away several companies that provide filtered water
services and several companies that offer coffee and coffee supplies. Why?
Our current vendor supplies both, and throws in the water service for free
(except for servicing twice yearly). The water companies can't possibly
compete with "free", and the coffee companies can't compete without being
able to offer me a water service or coffee for so cheap that I can get an
outside water service (with the usual up-front fees) and still save enough
overall that the hassle of switching is worthwhile.

    Tying only works when one of the services is highly valued, or when both
are valued. It's the first situation that gets people steamed, as they're
being forced into getting something they don't want if they want to get the
highly valued service. In this case, getting into the beta is the highly
valued service.
