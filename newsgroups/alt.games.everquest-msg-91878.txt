Clerics are good investments for guilds to make, and maybe
she's just gotten luckier with invites than you were. Is
there some reason she isn't playing on your server where you
can mentor and advise her a bit? (Level 9 isn't too late for
her to start fresh.)

Anyway, I wouldn't overthink this decision that much at
Level 9. Joining a guild isn't the end of the world; and it
won't be the end of her EQ career. Most players (even very
loyal ones) are members of several guilds over their EQ
career. And most people aren't going to hold against her
what guild she was in from level 9 to 30 or whatever. If the
people in these guilds are bad apples she'll know (and can
leave) long before then.

The goal of joining your first guild is just to get a feel
for _what a guild is_: how to communicate in that channel
without being a blabbermouth, figuring out what officers
are, seeing how intra and interguild disputes are resolved,
learning about guild politics, and building some lasting
friendships and connections. Guilds don't really become that
important until you start raiding and working on your epic,
which is 50+ stuff. Plenty of time before then.
