I am thinking of making one of these.  Are they a class that can
solo easily?   I have couple group dependent classes and a Bard and
a Necro, but I have gotten both of them to the point I am kind of
tired of playing them (both near, but not quite to 60).  The fire is
still there for my group characters (warrior and rogue) but for
those times when a group seems to long in coming I would like a new
solo class.  I do not want a druid (had one shortly and I just hated
the tree-huggin bastard).  Thanks for all input.
