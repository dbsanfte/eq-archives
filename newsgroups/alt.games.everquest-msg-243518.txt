: And you'll find.. when all is said and done, that people can and

Oh, good.  I was worried that I was seeing things when I saw that Iksar
driving the SUV at soccer practise, yesterday.

: Why is it so shocking that items gravitate in and out of the
: Everquest world and are bought and sold using real life money?

Not shocking.  Sad and annoying.  It's never shocking that people care
nothing for anyone other than themselves.  Selfishness seems to be the
all-encompassing feeling among so many.

: Is it
: that your brain has been conditioned to reject any world that has been
: defined as a 'game'? How real does it have to be before you begin to
: accept it as truth? Does it have to be as real as say the one depicted
: in The Matrix?

Ah, You are deluded.  My suggestion is to turn off the TV and the computers
where you linve before you get sucked in (a la TRON).

: One where all your senses have been stripped and

No, I refuse to accept it.  It's attitudes like that that lead to genocide.
Oh wait, too much hyberbole in that one.  I'll just say that accept that
which is unacceptable is both weak and foolish.  If you want something to
change for the better, would you just accept the status quo?  If your
landlord decided to be greedy and not fix the plumbing, not replace the
carpet, not fumigate should there be an infestation, not keep up the
landscaping, etc, and still raise the rent, would you just accept it?  Of
course you would.  He's just being greedy.  Accept it.
