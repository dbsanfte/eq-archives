My Druid killed him when he was lvl 17 or so.  I was also near Derv 3 when I
spotted him.  Took some effort to kill him, but I did it without dying (yay)
and looted a Scarab Ring.  It was the first really interesting thing my
Druid ever looted, and I was VERY proud of it!  That was back in the days
before Bazaar was around and magic items were hard to come by for young
players.

I still have the Scarab Ring in my inventory today, as a reminder of my
first good loot!  Today I'm a level 50 Druid. )
