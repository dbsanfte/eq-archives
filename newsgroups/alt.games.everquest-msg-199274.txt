EQ is full of STR items, but STA items are much harder to find and are
much more expensive. I would personally put the points in STA (I have
a retured 53 monk that went all STR)

When you equip look for items with...

Hitpoints (you can never have too many)
AC (the higher your total AC the better)
STA
Resists (not really much of an issue until you hit the mid-high levels
