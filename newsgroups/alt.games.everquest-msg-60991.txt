This is indeed how multiquesting works, and it can work even if
you do the different parts with your own characters and have to log
out to switch.

Each character needs to have sufficient faction to do the quest, or
their part won't register.  The character doing the final handin will
be the only one to get the item and faction, although if grouped they
will split exp with the group.

Unfortunately, there are some quests which cannot be MQ'd,
most are fairly easy to spot.  If a quest involves you getting a
no drop container in which you must combine several no drop
items, resulting in another no drop item, and that item is the
only thing you need to turn in, then there is no way to multiquest
it.

I may be remembering a different quest, but I think the one you
are talking about is one of the latter, where you need to put
both heads in a box and combine it, then turn that in.

What you could do, though, is position your cleric near the
Corflunk spawn, log out, log in  your paladin and kill him,
then quickly switch back to your cleric to loot the head.
Now you would have a single character with both parts...
is the resultant armor no-drop?  If not, you can then hand
it over to your paladin and congratulate yourself on getting
around your problem!  If it is, then you get to find out if
Bloodforge will fit a gnome...
