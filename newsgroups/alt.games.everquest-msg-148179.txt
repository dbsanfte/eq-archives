Just make sure you have a second person who can root. Root both mobs at
once then kite the pets well away. (If you get far enough away before
root breaks, the skeletons wont' even bother following you.) The pets
are wimps and can easily be kited down without snaring them if you have
SoW on, or buy a sow potion. Once the pets are gone, you can root one
skellie again and take on the other with your friends. The mage pet
should be ok to tank for most of the fight. Not sure how good the BL's
warder is at that point.

Keep trying and refining your tactics. Kind of a challenge for that
small of a party at your level, but that's what makes it fun. Oh, if you
use the root and kite, you may want to camp everyone out and back in
between pulls to clear the aggro list.
