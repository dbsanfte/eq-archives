Id have to disagree... but I do not have your eyes... the colors are
not that close by far...  Are you color blind?  is your monitor blury?
finger prints on monitor?   Honestly, the amount of change in the Con
color in the Chat box is so minimal...  I actualy found it easier to
read... and have complained (feedback) on numerous occasions about how
dark it actualy was...  So dark it blended in with a black
background..

but again.. thats my opinion...
