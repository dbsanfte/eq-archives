Ahhh, wish you'd said hi! I finally hooked up tonight with Lance (Spendid
One, 52 Gnomage) and we played a couple of adventures together. It's fun
meeting the a.g.e. folks ingame (especially if they know more about the game
than I do, which is most of them). Lance and I both are going to be parked
at 52 for a little while waiting for some friends to catch up. Soon as you
hit 47, let me know and let's do an adventure together!
