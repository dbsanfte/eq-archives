Its not verant so much as regional problems in areas all over.
Verant has to depend on the internet also.

Usually when I have trouble in EQ I also have trouble on about half the
websites I go to regularly but the other half work fine, that is usually
a clue that its a regional thing with routers somewhere or just the
internet in general.

The problem is that the internet is not really set up to have 75,000
people or something all connected to this one location. When Everquest
first came out they had to totally rebuild the pipe going to them and of
course they had no idea that they'd have a problem. The thing is, this
can only get worse unless they upgrade to a point where it doesn't all
over the country. I mean, what happens when you have tons of traffic for
this mmorpg over here and for this one over here and for this one over
here.

I mean good god.. if Everquest and such have problems think of what will
happen when the Sims Online comes out which is a much more general
interest title. It should give all new meaning to the phrase "internet
bottlenecks" when a million people all try to get in at the same time.
