I'd think a shaman would work very well, actually.  Shaman get
very nice melee buffs, and the rogue is the ultimate damage
producer, so he'll benefit more from those buffs than anyone.  My
experience with a shaman is that they make quite decent sponges,
probably better than any class who doesn't have a healer for
support; in fact once they get up to pet level (34) they end up
standing in front of mobs because they are better at taking
damage than the pet, even though eventally the pet does much more
damage than they do.

At any rate, a rogue partner would mean massively boosting this
particular style of play; shaman sponges the damage while the
rogue stands on the opposite side (later accompanied by the pet)
and dishes it out to the mob.

You won't have "real" crowd control, but you'll have root, or the
pet can off tank, or heck, even the rogue can off tank if it
comes to that, shaman buffed and a slowed mob even a rogue can
tank if he must.  Shaman are also "real" healers; not the best,
but much better than rangers or paladins, and with shaman mana
flow their relatively poor healing is made up for in the long run
by the massive amounts of mana they have available.
