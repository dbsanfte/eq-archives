Trying to get a handle on how many people are having this issue and what
hardware they have.
I have a K7S5A mainboard with an Athlon 1600+ processor
Radeon 8500 video
Did have a SB live value card but took it out to see if was issue - on on
board now
I have acable modem
And I am running 98se

My machine freezes up in from a few seconds to hours.  and generally cleanly
to the desktop with the right click on desktop menu up - prolly becasue I
steer with the mouse.  I would also like to test other apps with directX 8.1
to see if my hardware crashes in them.

If you crash to desktop please respond in the newsgroup.
