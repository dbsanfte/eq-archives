I am thinking about getting a Rubi BP for my Half Elf 56 War, but I am not sure what it
would do for him. I copied the date following from the Allakhazam site. What does  (L1)
mean? Does this mean 3 HP per tick? I have read somewhere that these items regen at 5 HP
per tick, and another place said 8 HP per tick. The char's normal unbuffed regen rate is 6
HP per tick. What would be the total regen rate with the Rubi BP?
