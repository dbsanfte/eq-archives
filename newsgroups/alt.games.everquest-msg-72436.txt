First off, go back and check your logs to see if you actually got any
points up on your 1HS doing this (it'll be a serious fucking bug if it
did go up).

Second, who cares?
At level 56, do you really think you're gonna be meleeing anything?
That right click dot off your scimmy is gonna generate more damage
than you melee ever will.
