Part of the reason I picked a ranger (and druid) was that they could solo
during the late night hours when no one else was on.  (There is NOTHING BETTER
than being one of 8 people in the entire Eastern Wastes at 4 in the morning,
soloing blue rygorrs, drinking coffee, very peaceful way to start the day). 
Being able to harmony is part of the package, it's how we hunt.
That's like nerfing a warriors attacking skill and then telling them "hey learn
to live with it, rangers have always lived with it."  The obvious response is
"but warriors are SUPPOSED to be able to do REAL damage".  
Since there IS a "higher level harmony", some of this is a moot point.  
It had enterred my thoughts that there were going to be a few MORE wasted zones
as everyone flocks back to Karnor's Castle and Overthere to find groups. 
The crowds, the yelling, trains.... YUCK!
