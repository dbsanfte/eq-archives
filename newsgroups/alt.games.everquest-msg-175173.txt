It doesn't matter if it's their stuff or not, they may not -require- a 
search, period, unless an arrest has been performed (by a police officer 
or citizen's arrest), 'probable cause' exists (ie, there is reasonable 
suspicion of wrongdoing), the item is in plain sight (hence it isn't a 
real search at all), or they have a warrant.  They can, of course, ask 
politely to perform a search at any point, at which point it'sa search 
with consent.  Sorry, but I don't consent.  My lawyer friends would make 
fun of me.

Note that none of the above four conditions exist in a normal transaction.
