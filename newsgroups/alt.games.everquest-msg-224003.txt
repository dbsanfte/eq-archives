Not in my experience, and it doesn't protect them from a failed record.

We sometimes come to the conclusion as a group it may be better to head 
back, get another adventure, rather than struggle on, but I've never had 
someone leave on their own because we weren't going to succeed.

Rescue = find a mob, walk them back to the exit without them dying. 
Involves killing everything up to that mob to make the walk out easy.

Assassinate = killing mobs until the target spawns, killing everything 
up to the target, killing the target.

Collection = killing enough mobs to get enough drops.

Slaughter = killing a specified number of mobs.

Yep, all varied ;)

You can Rescue/Assassinate using the sneak approach if you wish.

The only true sin, is the act that injures others.
