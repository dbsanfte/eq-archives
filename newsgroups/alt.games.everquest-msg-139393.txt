Really?  Then why don't you ever post them?

}The problem is, you and your loony friends never acknowledge because
}it shows your posts for the lies that they are...

Oh, I see, you must have cancelled them.  I have yet to see you post 
anything that shows that anyone else in any of these threads is a 'liar'. 
It would be enough if you even posted something that suggested they might 
be in error, but you seem to have a problem actually posting things that 
might constitute 'evidence'.

}Just FYI, there are much earlier posts from Lesa and BS that are
}personal attacks..

Really?  The posts I referenced precede any posts they have made at all 
that were crossposted to alt.dss.hack.  I notice, however, that you don't 
deny that your own post, or Mr. Wizzard's, was insulting.

}I have NEVER, EVER, NOT ONCE went on the offensive and attacked
}anyone..  That is a statement that you can take to the bank..

This is directly contradicted by the evidence I have provided.

}Anyone that I have ever attacked, has always attacked me or my family
}first...

This is directly contradicted by the evidence I have provided.

}>}Don't let the door hit you on your ample ass on the way out...
}>Oh, hey, look!  Another personal attack!  But God forbid you should be 
}>repaid in kind, or the whining will never cease.
}As I said, I did not draw first blood...  But when attacked I will
}aggressively respond in kind...
}If Lesa didn't want this to be a personal attack-fest, then she should
}not have started the attacks...

This is directly contradicted by the evidence I have provided.

}I could make fun of this GNOME thing, but that would be WAY too
}easy...  :^)

Feel free.  If I didn't consider it fun, I wouldn't be a proper gnome.
