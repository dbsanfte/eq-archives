Yes, at least I think so.

SoW is faster apparently based upon alteration skill. Therefore a
caster who has alteration at the level of say 50, would make a faster
sow with the potion than a person at level 50 with no alteration
skill... or perhaps I am high.

I got that impression because I had a troll sk (gets alteration
actually...) who used an sow potion at level 5 and was quite slow but
actually raised alteration skill when she used it (like you would from
casting a spell)
