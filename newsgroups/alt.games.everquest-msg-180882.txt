I used to work at a grocery store. I tell you, I got a kick out of it
every time I saw the cop putting a ticket on someone's window for
that. people are nasty about it when they get caught, too. One lady
got to her car just as the cop was leaving and shouted after him "I
hope you get cancer someday!". Geez, people, it's your own damn
fault...
