  Hiya Lance!  Good to see you back.

   I have the same urge, I must admit.  I still love playing a cleric.  
But having a "main", meant that I felt obliged to  get her decked out in
decent equipment, which meant that I spent alot of time "working" to
restock myself for the bazaar so that I could afford some of the nicer
things. And I got burned out on the whole "EQ as a part time job" thing.

   Again, same.  And it seems that at least on FV, whatever guild I'm
generally starts to go to hell just about the time I start needing a guild
most for grouping and stuff.  Though this time, I think that there might be
several guilds across all servers that might be in trouble.

   Yah... I have very mixed feeling about this.  My account is still
active, and lately I have been getting the urge to fire up and play.  But
I've just not sure what I want to play, or where.   Maybe a reasonable cure
would be for me to start out another character on a new server, and this
time take a "Vow of poverty" ie make a decision to not spend large chunks
of time farming or making stuff to bazaar.  Hmmm... Maybe start a new class
somewhere, something that isn't as group dependent as my cleric is. 
Problem is, I can't think of anything I'd really like to try that I haven't
done already.  Bard does seem interesting to me, but I tend to be pretty
chatty, and I don't know that this would fit in well with my play style. 
Or I could try a druid somewhere, the one priest class that I've never
really played.  Maybe a rouge or Beastlord?  /sigh. 

   I don't know.  I don't want to stay away from EQ forever, at least not
at this point.  I don't want to play a character that I'll have to spend
alot of time farming to equip with either equipment or reagents.  And I
don't want to have to spend hours waiting on a group, either.  I fear the
lower levels of EQ are not like they were when I started out.  I don't know
what I want to do, or on what server I want to do it (but it can't be FV,
since no way am I going to delete Teapray, and I've canceled my third
account).
