With a game as sophisticated as this one is, you'd think it wouldn't
be that hard to create a decent /help command, and keep the text help

Come on Verant... it's just a small bit of word crafting!

They seem to love writing fantasy storylines for the new goobers they
add to the game, but can't manage even a 3rd rate user's manual.  Ugh.
