Happily working along in BOT today, had a wizard drop out and get
replaced by a new one.

As usual, I shot him a tell, "do you have Virtue?"

"I'm fine thanks" he says.  I don't think much of it, buff lasts
over 2 hours with no equipment or AA to extend it, frequently
people do have Virtue when they show up to play, just as I often
have KEI.

We do several pulls, then the ranger gets a pathing problem and
ends up with three mobs.  Things are touch and go, and there's no
chance even with the SE I led in with that Cheal is going to make
it on the MA... no problem, this is why I love DvA, emergencies.
Duck out of the CHeal, slap DvA.

The two mobs that havent' been mezed  yet both turn around and
pound the new wizard to a fine paste.. everyone else had between
three and four bubs of HP left after DvA, he had less than one!

Come to find out he did Not have Virtue or any other HP buff, he
merely was sure enough of his ability to control aggro that he
expected to not get hit over and above his epic rune.

Well the nice thing about being 65 is that such things warrant no
more than a chuckle, rez, buff up (including Virtue this time)
and back to work.

Point being, if you are a cleric, make sure they really have the
buff you asked about.  If you aren't a cleric, and one asks if
you have the buff, don't try to be manly about it, if we think
you need it, we might just know something you don't!
