That 15 wisdom drop would seriously suck for training tradeskills.  Maybe
after I get my epic I'll consider it.  I never see my shield for sale, so
not sure what the going price is now, but I have given serious thought to
selling it in the past in order to finance tradeskills.  At the time I
considered it, it was still around 25k.  I guess I can check into prices on
EMarr.
