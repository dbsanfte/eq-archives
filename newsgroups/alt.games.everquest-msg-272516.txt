I have to start out by saying I am biased ;)

Alot depends on trust - if it's a regular guild or pick-up group it can work
well to have the scout pull.

With a group of mobs I can pretty much assume if I pull that the aggro of
the first mob will always be on me, and if I can get through that I can do
the other good stuff later.
Unfortunately it takes some time before other classes are aware of what you
can do because they have grouped with some that haven't met their
expectations, and some people don't realise some of the abilities we have
can drop aggro from us too.
We had a fairly even group at the scarecrows near TS station where I got to
pull, the enchanter mezzed the add ...it was great... made me tank for a day
(okay, maybe a few hours...I am over that joke where a rnager walked into a
bar....).

Like anyone used a ranges weapon, when the main tank pulls I still do a
wounding arrow or other ranged shot to get my attack up as the main tank
normally gets aggro back before the mob hits the main group.

Keep having a go though, I'm sure when you get it down pat you will be
invited to alot better quality groups =)
