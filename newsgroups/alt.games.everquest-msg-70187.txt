Rallos Zek is an "Evil" god in the world of Everquest. So it should
not be surprising that non-evil races/guards want to kill a follower
of RZ.

If you picked RZ for role-playing reasons, then you will have to
accept that some NPCs will hate you. Most guards throughout Norrath
are levels 35-50+, so "out-leveling" thier aggression is not a viable
option.

One option is to  raise your faction with the guards that hate you.
You basically need to kill some creature that they hate that will
improve your reputation with them (you will get a message when you
kill something telling you which factions go up or down). This can be
a LONG and TEDIOUS process depending on how "Kill on Sight" you are.
Also some factions cannot be raised, no matter what you do.

The safest route is to go Agnostic. Many people do this to avoid the
downsides of choosing a religion. 

In the end it all depends on how "YOU" want to play your character. I
suggest you do some research on the following sites:

www.everlore.com
eq.castersrealm.com
www.everquest.com
