The challenges high level casters have finding their spells are no different
than high level melee types finding armor.   It means tons of camping and
the winning a roll against all the other melees for the armor or quest
items.

In fact I rather enjoy watching casters work for their spells since they
like to camp items for melees classes (that they can't use) and sell it to
them.
