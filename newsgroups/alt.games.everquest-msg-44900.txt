Anyone

Saw an /ooc last night in Everfrost.  "What is an unstable gate?  What am I
doing wrong?"

As if the casting time isn't long enough, they have to nerf it's chance of
working, too.  I guess the non-gating classes are getting balanced up by the
nerfing of the gaters.

No matter, I never mem gate in battle situations.  Don't have the room as a
chanter.
