Man!  You guys are extremely defensive here.  I do recall saying that

"If you really are actually having fun, then keep playing but I always got
the impression that EQ turned in to a frustrating job rather than a game."

geez. Sorry.
People DO do things that they don't like exspecialy if they expect them to
change.  I was always hoping that by leveling up or getting new
equipmnent/spells, the game would eventually be fun.  It didn't.

And I KNOW that I'm not the only one.  All you have to do is read the boards
on various EQ sites to see that many keep on playing and hating it
simoultaneously.
