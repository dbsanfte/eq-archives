Hello, EverQuest fans! I am looking for EverQuest players who would
like to share their stories about EQ. Specifically, I have a survey
that I'm hoping you'll take a few minutes to fill out. It's very brief
and totally anonymous. I'm attempting to figure out, via the survey,
what aspects of EQ people find most intriguing and why it is so
"addicting"!

Please visit students.washington.edu/jneils and click on the survey
link if you are interested. (You must be 18 or older, please.)

Background: I'm enrolled in the class "Ethnography of Online Role
Playing Games" at the Univeristy of Washington. (Ethnography is the
study of populations of people by becoming part of that population.)
Playing EQ is a requirement of the class, and though I had my doubts
-- severe doubts -- it's been FASCINATING. I now have to include
myself among those who are completely fascinated with the game,
especially the social aspect. I have 4 characters, two each on the
Karana server and the Saryrn servers. My favorite is a level 7
Halfling Druid, and I can't wait to be done with the class so that I
can focus more on leveling and learning the RP aspects of EQ!

In any case, the final project is due next week, so please check out
the survey soon. Though many of my friends in EQ have promised to do
so, very few are delivering. (Why take a survey when you can play the
game?!) I think the message boards might be more successful in getting
participants. Please, Please, Please, if you play EQ -- 1 hour a month
or 100 hours a week -- please take a minute to check it out. Or send
me an e-mail if you want more info. My e-mail is on the above link so
please send me any questions, comments, or additional stories. We'd
love to hear from you, even beyond the survey answers! Expand on what
you like about the game, what you've found interesting...whatever.
Thanks a million!
