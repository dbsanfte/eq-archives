    Remember when players complained that if their newbie monk last his
corpse they couldn't do any of the further quests? Quests were put in
Cabilis for each of the classes to get the newbie item from scratch. So if a
softskin is willing to put in the time (same as an Iksar getting faction for
those dratted headbands), they can get the shackles. The foraged items were
even made droppable to allow it.

    And, of course, the level 62 monk in DL also happened to (pre-last
night's DL adjustment, no idea if he still does) drop the last shackle in
the series (Tynnonium, comes after Steel) about as often as Brothers Z and Q
drop the robe. Except the DL monk was on a static 30 minute timer. So if you
are a human monk, you could skip the faction part just like an Iksar doing
his epic.
