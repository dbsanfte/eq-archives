Actually, I've sorted it.  And it's rather embarrassing.

See, someone around here hasn't been paying attention to the new UI.  Need I
say more?

Well, for those who haven't messed about with it, the new chat windows
contain a menu allowing you to select your language.  It appears that at
some point while experimenting I'd selected Thieves' Cant, forgotten about
it, and any /language commands I was putting in to try to get back to Common
were REPORTING that I'd got back to Common, but being immediately overridden
by the menu and put back to Thieves' Cant.  What fun.

Note to Verant:  Remove /language command, as is now redundant, and an error
message would have been more use.

I gather the complete lack of speech last night was some kind of glitch, and
it seems to have resolved itself.

I feel remarkably foolish now...
