Defenders receive by far the most effect out of the power (A base 12.5%).
Controllers come in a distant second (around 9%?), while everyone else only
derives a base 7.5% benefit. However, this can be very substantial,
particularly for Maneuvers. Consider that SR Scrappers bread and butter
defense, Focused Fighting, appears to only offer ~10-12% defense bonus, only
applies that bonus to melee, and only applies it to the Scrapper possessing
the power. A Defender with Maneuvers effectively gets a slightly better
combination of both Focused Fighting and Focused Senses, providing double
the slot allocation utility, and the Defender also applies this bonus to
everyone in the group. Even more significantly, it stacks iteratively, so a
group of 3 Defenders with Maneuvers (completely unenhanced) each derive a
37.5% Defense Buff, reducing white minion attacks to a 12.5% chance to hit.
That's huge. An Invuln Scrapper selecting Stealth and Maneuvers has superior
defense buffs to a Reflex Scrapper with Focused Fighting and Focused Senses.
He'll also be more desirable to team with, since his Maneuver bonus is
shared love.

In general, Defense buffs are easy to acquire from the power pools, whereas
damage resistance is not, making the former dramatically inferior to the
latter as a secondary.
