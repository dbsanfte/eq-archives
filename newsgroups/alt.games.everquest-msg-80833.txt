I am planning on reformatting my hard drive and i wanted to ask you all what
neccassary steps i should do before hand to insure i dont loose vital eq
data....

What should i back up and so forth..
I really dont want to do this but i am starting to have more and more EQ
problems and i think that a fresh HD and Reload may be the best thing for my
unstable Eq-mental health :)

Any other tips for reformatting would be helpful also ....

Thank you

    -kris
