    Kael armour has the highest AC of the three quest armours, and is
considered "best" for tanks. Being on Kael faction also gives you a LOT more
things you can kill - dwarves, dragons in several zones, quality named mobs
in ToV. If you're with the dwarves, you usually end up also being with the
dragons, and all you get from that choice is some of the ToV quests (which
produce items that are arguably better than NToV analogs, but which are MUCH
MUCH more difficult to complete).
