*First post here, bear with me*

I'm currently a level 54 Ranger, and can pretty much back up the whole fear
kiting jazz.

That is our one true strength for a good long while...in my own playing, i'm
guilded, but solo 90% of the time i play, because of bad experiences nearly
every time i group(hot head mages deciding to pull, tanks not letting the
cleric rest between chains, that sort of stuff that gets people killed real
quick like...)

I'm currently hunting JPF, griffons & anacondas...ahh...exp grinding...fun...

Anyway...a basic hunting guide for rangers, from my point of reference would
be:
4-17 Blackburrow, if you can't find it, ask, it's a great zone, loads of
grouping chances, and once you get your spells at level 9, you can solo pull
the elite ledge and basically just sit back and level for a few hours.(I took
about 6 hours give or take from 9-17, and only hung in that long because i
wanted to be dual weilding by the time i hit PC.)

17-23 Paludal Caverns, Luclin...about 3 hours, 2 or under if you've got a good,
well balanced group at b2...fun, exciting, great place to learn your role in a
group, and always a great place to save for your bazaar shopping sprees...

23-33 I did my time in South Karana, right outside Splitpaw. Camped either a
spire, or the northern hill, right by a little pine tree. Great visibility to
watch for adds, easy to pull a passing gnoll, or the one on the northern hill,
and butcher the poor bugger.(get Temp first, this is an hp nightmare, be sure
to burn mana on your healing spells between pulls, practice bind wounds, during
the fights, nuke often to build your evocation...)

33-44 Now, most people might wander over to DSP after the fun times in
SK...instead, head to Surefall Glade, then on to Jaggedpine Forest.
If you have a map, or you use the Blackburrow basement entrance, find the cave
with the Brell Gnolls, then move right along past them to the basilisk
cave...set-up a little camping spot, and start pulling and fear kiting. Exp is
pretty fast throughout, there's virtually no competition for turf, the gnolls
nearby are nice enough to have a bank and shops waiting when your pack gets
loaded, and the forages are great fodder to sell to hard working cooks, as well
as the countless Basilisk eggs you'll be gathering as you hunt.
44-54, Basilisks pretty much dry up for exp once you hit 44, so it's off to
find bigger game, namely griffawns. Hunt 'em down, watch for nearby griffawns
and griffons, and rake in some easy exp with fear kiting.
At 48, start mixing griffons in, when you get Wolf Form, be sure to ALWAYS hunt
jpf wolfed, it really cuts down on griffon adds(if you have the cash for a
Lupine Dagger, or buddies willing to help you hunt one down, get it, you can
start G. Wolfing at 45, very very handy, really cuts down on add-based
frustration)
By 52, you should be able to pick up anacondas pretty easily, in addition to
griffons, griffawns will have dried up for exp around 49. Poachers are good if
you want to take your chances, or try out root and shoot, but i advise against
even wasting your time without a few packs full of fletching supplies or a
Tolan's Bracer, you'll burn too many arrows for too little damage, not really
worth it out of a group.

Well, that's where this ranger is so far, still loving JPF, and looking forward
to 55...one of these days...(21.5 Levels squeezed out of one zone isn't half
bad...)

Good luck, good hunting, and sorry i kinda got carried away there...
