If you used all the copies of your Service Level Agreement that guarantees
100% uptime on your systems as toilet paper, maybe you could afford to play
EQ with the savings, because that's all they're bloody well good for.

100% uptime doesn't exist, and if you're any kind of Sys Admin you'd damn
well know that shit happens beyond your control.

Purely on attitudes, you should try being a stock boy yourself.
