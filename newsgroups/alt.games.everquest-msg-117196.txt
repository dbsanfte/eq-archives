Not ALWAYS - but in the vast majority of cases it is.

The practice of Seppuku can be reasoned out, but *only* within the context
of a given cultural upbringing.  To me, the practice seems irrational in the
extreme.

Yes, you probably could.  Unless you could demonstrate that their employers
knowingly and wilfully denied them the protective equipment they needed to
prevent it, in which case by all means sue the employers.  But despite what
these ambulance-chasing vulture lawyers are telling me on every TV channel
throughout the day, I firmly believe that an 'accident' is just that - that
some things CAN happen without anybody being to blame.  If an employee is
injured in the line of duty then it is up to the company to support them,
whether or not it is due to the company's negligence.  But to use a game as
a scapegoat, and to attack its manufacturer, is to protect the people who
really SHOULD be answering the questions.  In this case, the people who
should have seen the effects the game was having on his already troubled
mind.
