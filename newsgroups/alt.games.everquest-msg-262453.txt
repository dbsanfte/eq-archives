    (A) The guild has been told that anyone giving people grief on XP days 
for not helping with an epic will be dealt with severely. We have XP days so 
we can get everyone up to 70 and with as many AA's as humanly possible 
before we start raiding serious zones like Riftseeker's, not so people can 
dick around getting Quarm-level loot (Epic 1.5's).
    (B) Once per week, we're going to have Epic Days. The whole day's 
raiding will be centered around epic kills. Priority will be given based on 
closeness to completion (which I disagree with, I think it's a mixed 
message), and on how clearly you explain what you need to officers in your 
written submission. Anyone who wants a kill scheduled on Epic Day needs to 
e-mail a written submission to the officers saying how close they are, what 
needs to be killed, where, details of the encounter, approximate force 
required, etc. The officers didn't want to do this, by the way, but soon 
realized as you did that without this we'd never get people doing XP.

    I've put off doing any of my epic until later. Epic 1.5 isn't much 
better than my Aegis of Blackscales, and you gain a much larger amount of 
power from doing AA's at this point. I've done more AA's so far in OoW than 
I did in all of GoD, 19 this weekend alone. We found a nice safe pull spot 
in Riftseeker's where we can get 5% AA per kill, level 69 and 70 runes off 
nameds that hit no harder than regular mobs, and there's a named near our 
camp which drops a non-Lore 65 MANA augment, Back, Neck, Waist, Shoulder 
slots only. I've upped my pool by 180 (had to remove an old 15 mana aug) 
just by getting those augs on the weekend - none of the other casters that 
got their epics can say that.

    I'm hoping that in the future we also start having "Signet Days" and 
"MPG Trial Days", just to get everyone through those and flagged to move on 
in OoW. OoW looks like it has awesome loot in nifty encounters (one we did 
on the weekend is like a giant game of "Simon Says") - I want to do that 
ASAP.
