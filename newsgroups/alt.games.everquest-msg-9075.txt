* jaZZmanian Devil
| I suspect we're suffering from some miscommunication here on a couple
| of points to come, but this is certainly one of them. I specifically
| included that particular strategy *because* I had a chanter in my
| group all weekend.  We had a set deal. Everyone attacks the same mob
| I'm on. She mezz's the rest as well as she can. However, if one of
| them is *BEATING ON HER* then it's *obviously* not mezzed, now is it?
| And if it's continuously whacking on her, then no matter how good her
| channeling skill is, the odds of her getting off another successful
| mezz on it are significantly decreased.  So yes, I will pull off the
| primary target and hit the one attacking the casters, including the
| chanter. If it's beating on somebody, then it's *not mezzed*.  That
| seems pretty obvious.  And as to the equally obvious response of,
| "Well, she might be in the process of mezzing it right then." that's a
| chance I'll take. Once it's safely back beating on me, she can mezz it
| again at her leizure.

My chanter is only level 42, but the common plan goes like this:

Plan A: Mez creature.
Plan B: Tash, mez.
Plan C: Tash, little stun, big stun, mez.
Plan D: "Guys, ON THIS %t. NOW."

Comments:
Mez (at level 42, that is "Entrance") takes 2.5 seconds to cast.
Tash takes 1 second to cast.
Level 4 stun takes 1 second to cast.
Level 20 stun takes 1.5 seconds to cast.

A normal everyday mob has an attack cycle of 3 seconds.

The chance is getting off an Entrance in between attacks is quite good once
you get the timing.  If you get hit, chances of getting it off is still
there.

Tash, mez tactics is for when a mob does not want to be mez'ed.  Typically,
this is when the chanter is much lower than the rest of the group (39
chanter in Frenzy, LGuk comes to mind :)  Mob can be beating on chanter or
someone else.

Tash, little stun, big stun, mez is for those low delay, hard hitting ones
who really, really insists on not being mez'ed.
Frenzy with FBSS, mobs that has had a shammie mob walking by recently are
examples of that.  You need that tash to stick to get in the stuns and mez.
Typically now the chanter will take damage, but guess what, chanter still
manages to fix this mess without the tanks swapping targets.

Plan D.  The "nothing I can do to this mob" option.  In 42 levels, I have
seen it about 5 times.  Again it is a sign of chanter being too low level
for the place.  This basically requires the entire group to swap targets.
I had the pleasure of having a big troll SK with me at the time, and Harm
Touch does wonders in this case.


But why is it wrong to hit a mob the chanter tries to mez?  Because
a mob hates everything a chanter tries to do to it with a passion.
While you keep trying to get it off, that mob is still beating on the
chanter, and you are keeping the chanter off using his best tool.
And your tools are not good enough to get it off.


| That does nothing but solidify my point. Warrior: High HP, High A/C,
| doesn't get hit as often for as much damage.  Chanter: Pretty high HP,
| Crappy A/C.  *Can* take a bunch of damage, but then will require that
| much MORE mana from the cleric to keep her ass alive, leaving that
| much less healing mana for me. This, I think we can agree, would be
| classified as "A Bad Thing".  :-)

No.  To get you completely healed takes 400 mana.  At level 42, that would
be about 2-2.5k hp healed.  Nice efficieny, really.  Keep that chanter
alive, and you will find yourself at 50% haste, you can focus on one mob
at a time (one mob mez'ed is 240 dmg/3 sec less), and in certain fights,
you will find your opponent at 50% slowdown.  So instead of fighting two
bloodthirsty ghouls doing potentially 480 dmg every 3 sec, you fight
one at half speed, 120 dmg/3 sec, *and* you deal significantly more
yourself (as well as the other tanks in the group, of course).


| I also apologize for the broken record thing, but if the critter is
| beating on somebody, be it the enchanter or any other caster, it's not
| asleep. It's fully awake and attacking. It is simply *not mezzed*.

No, it is "wating in line" :)  Just stay off it, trust your enchanter.


| And as soon as the critter is asleep, I won't worry about it anymore
| until it wakes up or become's it's turn for me to bash it. :-)

Good.  Now if you could stand next to it and cycle that taunt button a
few times before attacking as well, you would notice your chanter needing
less healing :)


| I *never* just taunt. I'm hitting as fast as I can while
| taunting. Another thing I probably should have, but failed to point
| out is that our chanters both had had a hotkey saying /%t is being
| mezzed. Don't attack it.  If they were going to mezz the one I was
| attacking, I switch targets again.

Generally, don't.  If there are two or three targets on top of each
other, I target one, pull an AE chain, and see if the HP meter starts going
down.  If it does, try to target something else, if it doesn't, mez it.
Names sometimes work, but quite often you get two similar mobs.

| If we make the assumption that I'm going to stand there and let the
| chanter get beat on, yes. I'll agree with you there.

In my spell book, I have by far more spells to prevent damage than to cause
it.  Heck I even try to line them up so it is easy to pick the next.  But
all in all, you are making my job harder when you try to help me.


* jaZZmanian Devil
| <skip scenario> Your scenarios do an admirable job of pointing out how
| important it is to have an enchanter in a dungeon group as you get
| higher in levels, which I have agreed with wholeheartedly since the
| discussion began. I did not, however, speculate on the difference in
| outcome between my dragging the mob of the enchanter or letting her
| get wailed on.

Ok, allow me to try:
It takes at least two cycles of taunt from a warrior to keep the mob from
going for the chanter after a mez provided chanter has done anything else
to annoy mob.  While in that time, there is nothing you can do to prevent
that chanter from taking damage.  Chanter has tools to prevent this, but
you are keeping him from using them.

* jaZZmanian Devil

Not necessarily.  Others have responded to you on this, and I do not
often call for the next target, but when I do, there is a reason.
I could do the "Please guys, you see that bloodthirsty ghoul over there?
Well, he was a bitch to mez and he will no doubt beat the crap out of me
when he wakes up in 15 seconds, so if you please could go over there and
taunt him a few times and then kill him, I would be most delighted", but
more typically, you will see me walking over to him and hail him about 10
times.
I try to always remez so that I have time for one tash and an additional
mez in case a mob resists the first, but that is a load of mana that is
really wasted if said mob is woken up 5 seconds later.
(But your list of priorities are good normally.)
