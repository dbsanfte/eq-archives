Does anyone know of a good website to use to find out what quests looted
items are for?  I've tried Allakhazam for a few different things I've found
that are "No-Drop" and I can't find them in quest search by item.  Couple
examples would be Large Fire Beetle Sternite, Calcified Skull, and Old
Silver Coin . . . Any help would be greatly appreciated!!!

As you can see, I'm kind of new :)
