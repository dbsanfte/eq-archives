This directly contradicts my experience.  Repeated testing in the
field, specifically as a level 18 thru 21 druid, shows that I can
reasonably reliably stick snare to red mobs (almost no difference
in stick % between a blue and red mob) and yet have trouble
sticking root even to blue mobs.  Specifically, the mobs in
question are aviaks, more specifically my principle target
over that time frame, rooks.  I find I was able to stick snare
to red to me rooks (must have been level 21 or 22) when I
was 18, and even now at level 21 have trouble sticking root
to blue rooks, have since they started turning occaisionally blue
at 20 (so must have been the 19 ones)

Similarly, I've started going after Harriers wholesale now,
and find that root is unlikely at best, while snare sticks about
2/3rds the time, which means one or two casts and I'm up
and running.

It is entirely possible that if snare is never upgraded, that when
better roots come out this situation will reverse itself.  At lower
levels, though, I can say unequivacably that I've had much better
stick rates with snare.

Hmm, I'll also note that I've never even considered taking the
root/dot method up without also snaring the mob.  I know that
some dinosaurs who ran their characters during the "root overwrites
snare" days are probably sneering at me, but the power of snare
to keep me from getting killed when root breaks is so great and
snare so inexpensive and long lasting, I just can't see it.  Since
I'm casting snare anyway, the difference with the root method is
that it simply means more mana spent.

Its true, DOTs have better mana efficiency and don't appear to
have partial hits.  At least I don't get any message telling me they
are doing partial damage, but then again I don't get -any- message
telling me how much damage they do.  Nukes, though, are doing
the job, and doing it quickly.  I've killed rooks since they were
red, and am now killing harriers which are also red, using snare/nuke,
and med after; its doing the job.  I'll try to do a root/DOT kill
and time that versus a snare/nuke, both starting FM and medding
back to FM.   My bet would be that snare/nuke is going to win
-at my level-... Once a second DOT line comes in the picture
milage may vary.

Again, at low levels, I seriously doubt that there's anything more efficient
than porcupining.  I've had four yellows pound away on me till near death,
with a snare and a DOT on each so they politely drop dead after trying
to run.  Between melee and the DS, they all pretty much killed themselves,
I ended the battle at half mana and half health.  Treeform, and both
bars would regen in about the same time.  Now as I level up, mob
HP go up faster than DS damage, and mob damage gets higher
because my AC isn't keeping pace, and because they are higher level.
Its hasn't been spectacularly efficient since hitting level 18 or so, although
I think some of that is in the mob... recall that I said "mobs that don't hit
hard..."
when clearing out darters and egrets, for example, this is still the way to go,
barely costs me any mana at all to porcy em to death, I end the fight down
two bubs of HP but I ignore it since with snare/nuke I'm not -using- HP anyway,
and gradually catch up while medding back -that- mana loss.

I think a lot of your truisms probably -are- accurate... at higher levels.  Since
we level up so quickly, you may have forgotten another truism: Verant Teaches
Us Wrong.  Very often, class after class you'll find that the -most- efficient
tactics at very low levels are the -least- efficient at high levels.  Thus, your
advice must take into consideration the relative levels of the characters and
their targets.
