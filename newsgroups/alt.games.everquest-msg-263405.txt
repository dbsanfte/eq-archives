Thanks again for the write up. A couple of questions for you:

1. How long did the entire zone take to complete?

2. If you zone out, does the entire thing reset? I.e. you can't start 
back where you left off? WoW is implementing raid-zones that are "casual 
friendly" that allows you to pick up where you left off. Soft of like an 
instanced version of say, North ToV where the bosses you already killed 
stay dead for like a week, but some of the roaming yard trash might 
respawn.

3. Does power regen in combat and do you get stuck in the EQ1 mold of 
sit/med/stand/cast/sit/med...?
