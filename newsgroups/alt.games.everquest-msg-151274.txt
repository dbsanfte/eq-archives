    Not gonna happen.. It's been over a month of this, and no signs of him
letting up.

    I highly doubt he has the means or resources to a) find out who I am,
IRL, and b) find where I live, and c) get to where I live with a bomb.. Not
really worried about that... but he's seriously hampering the enjoyment
factor.. Heh.. :)

    Well, reason it's against our guild policy to go /anon is that we *want*
our guild to be visible.  Not necessarily to say "Look what we did!"  (we
aren't an uber guild, by any stretch of the imagination), but to say "Look
what kind of people they are..."  We aren't cocky arrogant S.O.Bs like so
many guilds are...

    Personally, I would be extatic if I never saw him again...  I'm not "out
to get" him...  That would imply that I gave a rat's arse about him.  If he
leaves me alone, I'll leave him alone.. But, by the same token, I want to
send a message that this will no longer be tolerated.
