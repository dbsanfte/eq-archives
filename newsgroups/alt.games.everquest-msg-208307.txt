Im not sure "complain" is the right word, but let me clarify here.

Im refering to "real" monks, the guys who've been playing their class to a
high level for a long time, raid pullers and the like.  The people most
justified to talk on this.  Im NOT refering to the shit-fest that is
Monkly-business; that board can teach necros and mages a thing or two about
whining!

EW, Dorf bodyguard camp.   Kael, the first 2 mobs on Tormy ramp (on the very
