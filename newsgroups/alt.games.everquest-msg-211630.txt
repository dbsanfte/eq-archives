you can also root/fear/stun/nuke them. I soloed my cleric from 50 to 51 at
the dreadlands. i would hit them with the 220 damage stun spell, root them,
fear them, nuke with retribution, stun them, root them and reapeat until
dead. you can pick up a dark ember in bazaar cheap if you want to hit on
them at low health when they begin to flee. nice weapon with a decent proc.
or get a group to camp the enraged soulstealer in dulak and get yourself a
soulstripper.
