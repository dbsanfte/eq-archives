I measure run speed 3 times.  Once with 70 agility, once with 105 agility,
and once with 105 agility reduced to 76 with encumberance.
70 agi    2368/82sec = 28.9/sec
105agi    2369/82sec = 28.9/sec
76agi (encumbered) 2366/109sec = 21.7/sec

Conclusion:  Encumberance affects run speed.  Agility does not.
