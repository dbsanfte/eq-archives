There is actually backup servers (and the workaround some people used
appears to use one of them). Test has its own login server, as do the
Euroservers on a different provider (so I am told, I've never logged
into that one).

Who knows what broke. It seems very likely to be a hardware problem
and might be in front of the login server (like a router), not the
login server itself. But everyone is in Vegas.

It'll be nice when they fix it, though.. login troubles put a big dent
in our VT raid today, we only got to temeriel before having to stop
because of lateness.
