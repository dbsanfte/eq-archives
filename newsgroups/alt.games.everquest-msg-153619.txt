MB is virtually zero agro, so you won't die.. the problem is its LESS mana
efficient than casting regular nukes.

When you could all MB at the very start of the fight, use a mod rod to be
back to fm, and then nuke regularly, you were doing your regular damage plus
8-20k MB damage

Now?  Well after the nerf you will be doing less damage with MB than if you
had zero AA skills... VI does it a fucking gain
