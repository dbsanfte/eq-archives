Excellent!

Katta is out of the way, of course, but worth it for a piercer thats so 
spectacularly bad, yet fast.

Of course the picture doesn't show it as BER weildable, and it looks 
suspiciously like a one handed weapon... the text does list it as 
Berserker, which is nice because there's not much out there with vampire 
bane and there's a mob in TM that requires that.

When not fighting vampires though, its even worse than my prized 
abandoned orc shovel :)
