You obviously play a WAY different game of Sims than I do.

*sim whines about having to go*
"use toilet"
*sim heads for bathroom, just starts to sit down, guest wanders in, sim 
jumps up and curses*
*guest won't move from in front of door*
*sim pees on floor*
*sim whines about being hungry*
*get sim with high cooking skill (:-O are those batwing crunchies they're 
making??) to cook meal*
*get meal served*
*watch whining sim head to fridge and pull out $5 bag of snacks while $20 
dinner rots on table right next to sim*
*sim whines about being bored*
*send sim to watch tv*
*car for work arrives*
*click in futility to try and force sim away from tv. steam inwardly as 
sim continues watching television*
*send sim to pool to swim. remove all ladders. add expansion to 
graveyard.*
