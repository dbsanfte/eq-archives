I know they read here like once a month, but on the off chance they
are reading, or the more likely chance that some of you are playing
both games (I know Alex is), i recommend the AO strategy guide, BIG
TIME.  Just enough information to get you on your feet, helpul maps,
decent nano charts etc.  And they cuts it off just before too much
spoiler.  I rarely even look at hint books with the info on the
internet being so timely and free, but this is one time my $15 extra
was well  worth it.

And for all of you who heard the horror stories about the launch, be
aware that it is MUCH improved, with still a ways to go.

Check it out,
