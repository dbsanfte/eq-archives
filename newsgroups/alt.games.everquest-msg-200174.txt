Hello, all. I've got a level 34 Ranger on the Bristlebane server, and I've
been incredibly bored with him. I don't know of any good places to hunt, and
even when I'm in a group, my Ranger sucks. Should I just retire him and pick
up a new main or keep at it? He was my first real character, and I probably
didn't do very good in creating him and picking out gear. I don't feel like
starting a ranger all over again, even if I'll do a better job the second
time around. So, what do you guys think? Are Rangers really ranger (What my
friend calls useless things. "That's really ranger.") and should I give him
up, or should I find a new place to hunt and keep at it?

Also, I've got a 22 monk and it's a real bitch trying to find those skulking
brutlings in Warslik's. Any idea on the area they spawn in? I've gotten
vague tips to look around a "bandit lake" or something, but I haven't any
clue where that is. And there's always the problem of roaming giants, so
should I wait to finish my shackle quest until I'm a higher level?

Thanks for all your help.
