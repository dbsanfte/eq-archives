You will only get the Velious user interface if your screen is set above
640x480, so check that first. I didn't even realize that the game could go
back to the old interface. I recently did a fresh install of WinXP, and went
back and reinstalled EQ from the CDs and went through all the patches (cable
modem, so not bad at all.) As soon as I logged in I had the updated
interface.

So, my guess is that you are in a 640x480 resolution. Pump it up to at least
800x600 and you should see the Velious UI.

Good luck,

Lefty
