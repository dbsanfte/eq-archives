I would have gone anon from the first minute I came in and then ignored 
or turned off guild chat.  You have a right to play the game as you 
wish. Just because the guild has a 'Raid Policy' doesn't mean you have 
to be with them 24-7.  My guild does not rule my life.  If they are that 
controlling, you don't need the problems and are better off without them.
