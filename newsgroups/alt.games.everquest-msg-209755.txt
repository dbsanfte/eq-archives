That said, I am currently at 100% leveling exp, having just gotten AA8 at 
100% AA. I leveled to 51, went 100%, got to Run 3 (valuable to anyone but 
as a pulling monk its a nobrainer) and then leveled to 55... Now I have 
Regen3 and Crits, and I plan to leave AA alone until I hit 60. Then I will 
probably go 30% AA or so.
