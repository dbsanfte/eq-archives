Perhaps your funding didn't fly?  Or maybe you didn't thoroughly read
and comprehend the terms of a sale before clicking, "Submit."  After
all, you were prejudiced towards a negative experience, so why take
any steps that a reasonable person would take to ensure a positive
experience.

Or maybe you're one of those people that think their (comparatively
small) purchase somehow entitles them to a place in line ahead of
those who have been waiting for assistance with their (much larger)
purchases.

Whatever.

I've been buying from MySuperSales for years and I've never had any
trouble.  As recently as last week I purchased several hundred
thousand PP in EQL to bulk up my game toons, traders and barter
buyers.  Their deliveries have always been very quick, and the
communication excellent.
