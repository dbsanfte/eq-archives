Just want to get a few opinions...

How much is a rez worth to you? Specifically a 49+ rez....

Some poeple say its only mana...  However my mana is very important to my
group/guild.

How about when the cleric has to disrupt the enjoyment of the game (I know I
never HAVE TO rez anyone, but I do whenever I am able) or travel great
distances...  Whats it worth then?

And isnt rezzing a way for a cleric to make a few bucks?  Kind of like a
druid/wizzard does by porting?
