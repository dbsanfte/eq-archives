Hey im about to hit level 13 as a ranger and I am hunting for giant field
rats. No experience and all the fun I could be having is spent trying to
find spiderlings and stinking giant field rats with no whiskers. They are
the hardest drop to find and Im getting tired as all my friends hit 15th and
Im stuck hunting rats.
