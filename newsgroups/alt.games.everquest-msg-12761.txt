Nothing. They start strong and they stay strong. But their strength is more
apparent in solo combat than it is in group situations.

Added to that, since they're KOS almost everywhere, faction is usually of
little to no concern when deciding what to hunt.

If you're looking for a class that can be equally at home in either
situation though, the Necro is a fine choice
