Well some classes do real damage with a bow.  Namely rangers.  I don't doubt
there is a real argument for rangers to stay well back and fire arrows, but
it doesnt hold true for other classes.

If your "strat" for a mob involves every melee staying out of AE range and
throwing shurikens / knives / arrows (maybe 3 dps!) while a warrior, casters
and pets kill it... well its a) an incredibly gimp guild  b) incredibly gimp
tactics

If any melee other than a ranger is asked to stay 300 feet back and throw
stuff, there is no point them even being there.

Either devise a strat that allows your *guild* to all participate, or find a
real guild that allows you to actually contribute on a mob.

Walls, positioning, hiding, correct group formations, RC, cures, ae's etc
etc.. all things you can use on the very mobs you named (and imo should use)

So no, a gimp guild requiring every melee to stay out of every mobs ae range
is not a valid argument for paladins needing a) an archery skill or b) a
bow.
