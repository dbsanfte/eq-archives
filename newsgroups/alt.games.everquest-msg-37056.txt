I've occasionally ( when bored and medding ) picked on people over the
meaning of "need" when they /ooc "NEED A SOW/PORT/CLARITY!!!!". No,
you don't "need" those things. You can hunt and survive without them.
I do it all the time. Quite effectively. You "need" food, air, water,
etc. You "WANT" SOW/port/clarity.
