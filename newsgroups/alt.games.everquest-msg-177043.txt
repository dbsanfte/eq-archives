Faith and patience

It's only a game, I'll still get through my problems if you lose, I'm not
going to quit doing this either as I realize being a prophet isn't really
about predicting the future although that is a part of it. It's really not
that big of a deal, it's just a game and the fate of the world doesn't lie
upon its outcome.
