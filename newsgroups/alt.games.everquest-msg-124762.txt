Unless there's a new one, I know the "sploit" at the well that the OP is
talking about, and the reason that the GM isn't doing anything is that
it's pretty questionable as an exploit. Hardly foolproof or safe, and
downright deadly if you fuck it up. I haven't even bothered trying it.
There's easier ways to make a buck in this game.
