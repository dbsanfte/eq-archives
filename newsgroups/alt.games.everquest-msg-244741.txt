Can you hold multiple foraged items on the cursor at one time?  I know that
when I tradeskill items.  I can get 2 items (ie the combine plus the
returned item)  but was not aware that forage would allow that.  I assumed
it would give you the "you can't hold another item" message.

Very interesting idea, and sounds like it may work.
