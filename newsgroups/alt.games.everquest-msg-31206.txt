You're really mistaken if you think a ranger with a decent bow can't
generate HUGE damage using just a bow.

Remember, this is damage from outside melee range meaning the relative
aggro you generate is significantly lower than the warrior standing
toe to toe smacking away.

Primal bow + Avatar + haste cap + Trueshot == Sick damage.

There's a damn good reason why when our ranger get within melee range
of Yelinak after triggering this combo, they stand a very good chance
of turning into ranger paste...Yelinak HATES people generating that
much damage.
