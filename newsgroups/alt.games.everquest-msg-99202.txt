At level 48 you should move the characters to Emerald Jungle.  Set up either 
right near the Trak's Teeth zone line or in front of the tunnel to City of Mist.  
Make sure your bard has a good magic drum, Nostrolo's Tambourine at least, a 
Walrus Skin Drum if you can buy one for a reasonable price.  Memorize your three 
target DoTs (Fufil's Curtailing Chant, Tuyen's Chant of Flame, and Tuyen's Chant 
of Frost), selos, your regen song, manasong, amplification, and the level 34 
Cantata.
Bard tracks to a blue mob, hits it with one pulse of a DoT, tracks back to the 
druid, and pulls the mob back.  Druid snares AND roots the mob, sits back down.  
Bard twists the DoTs until the mob is dead.  The bard should be able to do about 
1600pts/minute in DoT damage with a Nostrolo Tambourine, 1700 with a Walrus 
Skin Drum.  The druid can drop a DoT or two on to speed up the process, just 
don't steal the kill.  
You should be able to get at least 20 kills an hour this way, more if the bard 
goes out hunting for more when the mob is at 1/4 health and the druid DoTs then.  
Of course you don't want to be grouped, or the druid will take a significant 
portion of the exp.  If the druid runs low on mana, group up for a couple 
minutes, have the bard twist Cantata, Amplification, Clarity, Cantata, Clarity, 
Clarity, repeat.  That will give you almost C3 level mana regen. 
One other way to do it IF you are good at running the druid is to have the bard 
group with you, put you on auto-follow, and just sing manasong as you quad-kite.  
You'll take 55% of the exp, but the 45% the bard is getting can be quite 
significant.  From your message though, I suspect that you're not an experienced 
quad-kiter.  :)
