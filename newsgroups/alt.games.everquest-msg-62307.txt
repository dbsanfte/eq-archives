Unfortunately, the ad people are becoming smarter and more insidious.
We have a continual problem at home with this because some ad banner
company has figured out how to put a delay into their script.
EVERYTHING will be shut down except EQ, you're in the middle of a
fight, and suddenly EQ minimizes and an ad window from nowhere pops up
with all of the resultant in-game havoc.

I hate to point fingers but I've only ever seen it happen after
accessing Allakhazam. I usually just recommend that the family reboot
the computer before running EQ.

/nod I did this after I realized the problem wasn't just a one-time
fluke and it helped our situation, at the expense of disabling so many
websites that I eventually just turned it back on so the family would
stop complaining about it.

I guess the point of this is that the original poster might NOT have
Explorer running. Anyone else experiencing this?
