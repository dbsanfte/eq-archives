Anything is arguable.. but you'd have to argue long and hard to convince
me of that.  I soloed at least half of each level from 44 to 60, and a good
deal prior to that.  All you need is a movement speed boost, either
buying SOW, SOW potions, or TBoots/JBoots, and its a simple matter
to root, nuke, run, root, nuke, run... elementary kiting.  Root is cheap, and
cleric DD ratios don't suck all that bad.

Compare to a warrior or better still a rogue?  Main reason clerics don't solo
is not that they can't, but that they tend to find groups so easily that
there's
no reason to.

> 2)Unstackable in exp groups unlike melee.

You don't really want more than one of most melee classes in a group
either.  You got cleric, chanter, porter to start with, leaving 3 slots open.
Now you want a sponge... but paladin, warrior, and shadowknight
damage output sort of suck, so you only want one of the above.  That only
leaves two slots and half the classes in the game to pick from.  I guess
you -could- take two of something, while you wouldn't want a second
cleric so much... but it isn't really that big a deal.

I remember when clerics were valued; back when they were one
of the rarest classes out there, and tank gear wasn't up to enough
HP and damage amelioration that a shaman slow/heal combo
wasn't usually sufficient.  Now you'll frequently see clerics of
all levels LFG just as long as anyone else.  Fortunately, since
we -can- solo quite happily, there's no need for us to whine.

Where clerics are needed is not in exp groups, its in raids.  Sadly,
raids don't give clerics much exp, since whatever group they
are in is short one damage producer, so they are rarely in the
KS group.  Thus, making them "vital" doesn't really do them
much good at all.
