Yes, you must be if this is a fairly frequent result of grouping in Sebilis.
Either you leave after a half a hour or your group members aren't giving you
the gems.

There is only three or so times I actually walked out rich, or rather, 3-5k
richer than what I went in (mind you, RICHER, as in AFTER expenses, ie.
Peridot consumption), not because I was scammed or short changed in any way,
shape or form.. but simply because every member (alteast those that spoke
up) in the group insisted that I get ALL ruby crowns/sapphire
necklaces/common gems (fire opals, fire emeralds, etc, basically anything
but Jacinths, Black Sapphires, Diamonds and Blue Diamonds), despite aguing
the issue once each grouping.

In most situations...(keeping in mind Im fortunate enough to own an
Enchanter as well with high CHA along with its beneficial spells for
buying/selling)

Stack of Peridots = 210pp (or ONE ruby crown and fire opal drop)

Symbol of Marzin (54+ seems to be the common level in which a cleric will
have any or better chances of finding a group in Seb, atleast on my server)
lasts one hour.

Assuming everyone is given Symbol (which I do unless its presented to me
that I dont have to bother, fine I wont object) thats 5 peridots or 52pp 5gp
spent (or less than ONE fire opal).

Within that hour I can EASILY, at just about ANY camp, get one fire opal
(not to mention a whole lot more gems and "things") to cover the expenses.

I'm sure those that never really thought about it are beginning to see the
clear picture.  Clerics if given EVERY "common" gem and jewel type item
(ruby crowns and sapphire necklaces, as well as amulets those are nice money
as well) WILL walk out of there many pp's to the plus.  Do I think this is
right as a Cleric?  No way in hell.  I dont agree totally with the "choose
your class, choose your income" theory.  I believe the PROPER thing to do is
collect what is needed to cover expenses for the night/groupage then alpha
the rest, though that is my opinion. <shrug>  Will it ever happen?  Probably
not a chance in hell, but... there's for wishful thinking.
