Basically, all of the above items, if you had phrased them seriously 
rather than try to take the piss. Restrictions on free speech, on 
women's rights, on anti-discrimination measures, on civil rights; 
general rollback of environmental protection and safety and public 
health regulations; a free rein for Big Business to do whatever they 
want, wherever they want, and get away with it; increased influence of 
Christian fundamentalism in school curricula; further erosion of the 
separation between Church and State... And probably quite a few more I'm 
not paranoid enough to imagine yet.

Admittedly, what some of us are scared of is what some others look 
forward to, but there you have it.
