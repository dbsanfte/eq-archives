So full of mis-information I don't know where to start...........

Epic has 4300hp, does 70DPS melee, 20DPS from procs - procs that
don't land on 60+ mobs (the standard for PoP tier2+ xp groups).

61 air has 3800hp, does 70DPS melee, a few more from stuns and
sword procs - since it's level 60 they land on 60+ mobs regularly.
Un-fearable, enrages, better mitigation/avoidance than epic.  
With Flameshield of Ro, only 5pts of ds seperate if from epic.

62 water has 3300hp, does 90DPS melee, a few more from ice nukes
and sword procs - since it's level 60 they land on 60+ mobs.

63 pet is a useless pile of steaming offal, but it's that poorly
conceived wizard pet concept.

Even mages focusing on AA are going to be grouping in Tier2+ pop,
to do otherwise is just plain stupid.  Taking on mobs within 5
levels of you grants a huge bonus to xp (nearly twice as much for
mobs at the bottom end, scaling upward as they get higher level)

The only place epic is better is soloing low 50's mobs.  These
mobs have no high con bonus, and soloing gets no grouping bonus, 
and you probably aren't in PoP with its (still) higher ZEMs.

Whip out 62 water, get in a group in Tier2+ PoP and yank in an
AA every 1.5hours like I did yesterday.
