It would shock me to hear that it wouldn't work, since it does work with
Win2k and XP is simply an upgrade to Win2k.

If you have a nice sound card though, sound on Win2k isn't as nice as it is
on Win98.

I might also caution you about using beta software as important as an
operating system if you aren't well-versed in what exactly that software IS.
You'll just be asking for trouble.
