Was it just a bit of fun or a "norm" on pulls?   Sounds a very messy and
time consuming way of pulling it :)

Fun is always good tho.  We had a wizard MA for The Statue of Rallos Zek
last night... the amazing thing is, he actually stayed alive for like 4%
(impressive on a mob with the HP of statue heh).. I think till the 4th or so
flurry

Snare.. hmm I didn't think it would land.. especially when all the bard
would have usd for debufs is oos.  Who knows though!

On mobs like that (well Vindi is the best example of it)  FD has zero use
once the mob is engaged, so no matter how many times you FD, you still get
rampaged all fight.

Generally when we have say 2-3 clerics at a raid (basically every single
cleric there is on the rotation) I pull it, then I run far far away and
feign.  It means missing the fight (I run in to disc it then run back out)
but hey.. survival must come first!

I know you guys debuff him on the pull, but I really dont think hes that
explosive on damage.

We used to kill him with 30 or so and usually have various people die on
engaging, so the time we had 21ish and were being raced by 2 other guilds to
him, I thought we were pulling him a lil unprepared.

We had 1 warrior, 1 shaman (me, had just arrived and was still buffing
people when he got to camp), and in the end the only death was my shaman (go
rampage).. I did slow him first time tho :)
