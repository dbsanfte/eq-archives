And I really don't see peoples issues here. The game is as hard as you want
it to be. If you feel like soloing Venril Sathir naked as a level 1, then
do it. If you feel like killing a level 1 mob equipping a Palladius Axe
of Slaughter, so be it. If you enjoy it. I enjoy twinking a real lot, I 
liek zooming through elvels, soloing things, which I could not without.
And the game is FAR from being ended in 4 days, me wondering where my money
went. What is all those Antitwinking whiner people's point? People getting
*their* items easier than they got them? Take a break from the game if such
a thing upsets you. I also never saw a guy with uber stuff emptying my hunting
grounds without me being able to find an alternative. Just being upset because
somebody got something cooler than you and is 50 levels lower? You start
early being grumpy old men.
