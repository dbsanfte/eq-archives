Hi All

Here is the heads up on a patch from the EQ Tech Forum plus a snippet 
from What's next.

First Patch

----------------------------- Insert Text 
--------------------------------

On 3/30/2004 at 4am all English Servers will be coming down for a 
Scheduled update

On Tuesday, March 30, 2004 at 4am pst (-8 UTC), all english language 
everquest servers (all but Kael Drakkal and Sebilis) will be coming down 
for a scheduled update. Estimated downtime is 3 hours.

------------------------- End Insert ------------------------------

Hopefully it will (Takes Deep Breath) Fix the patch of the patch of the 
fault in the DX9 implementation that is causing the video lag in even 
the old world to be almost unplayable.

As an added bonus I noticed on test. They have added the files for a 
zone called "Shadow Rest" the other day. It could be for the following, 
from the Future Developments Corner?

March and Beyond

Upcoming for March and April 2004

Graveyard Zone

Tired of losing your corpse?  The current EQ system removes corpses from 
the game after a week to reduce clutter and potential video lag.  But we 
know there are times when your character dies and you just can't get it 
right away.  Next thing you know a day turns into a week and BAM!  Your 
corpse is gone.  Since we can't leave the corpses sitting in game 
indefinitely, some inventive folks here have come up with another 
option.

We plan to create a "graveyard" zone that will only work if your corpse 
has decayed and disappeared.  If you have lost your corpse due to decay 
in other parts of Norrath, you will be allowed to enter this zone and 
reclaim it.

This is just one of the things slated to come out of the EQ Live 
laboratory.  Watch for other exciting announcements in the weeks ahead.

Well if they don't fix the video lag. This place will be well used. It's 
taking me 5mins to cross PoK from Ak'Anon stone to bank with SoW :(

I hate to think how long a corpse run would be to an outer zone!!!
