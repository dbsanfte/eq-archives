Hi all,

I have many ALTs (some that I haven't messed with in months) and I
have found that at least 3 of them are not logging in anymore, and
crash EQ to the desktop.  I have tried removing the INI's from the EQ
directory but that doesn't help anymore.  It happened a while ago and
that helped before.

GM's and Customer Service has not been at all helpful.  THey were able
to log them in and zone them to a safe spot zone, so I know the
characters work.  But I can't log them in.

Any ideas?
