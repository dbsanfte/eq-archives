Actually, I have no time to invest into the game leveling.  I do though,
have disposable income that I can spend to compensate someone for taking the
time to get me what I need.  I have read the EULA, that is why I am offering
PP for the items and cash for their time.

It is all opportunity costs (for those of you who haven't attended 9th grade
yet, look it up in the dictionary).   I'd rather spend my time working and
making money, then leveling and gaining armor or weapons for my character.
When I do have free time, about 2 or 3 hours a week, I would like to play
EQ.  I love certain aspects of the game but I don't care about guilds or
high level raids, just something I can do during my free time.

I find that most people are jealous cause they can't afford to do what I do,
so they spend the 500 +hours to level and play their characters, and then
bitch about someone trying to take a short cut.  I love playing EQ on my
terms, not yours.  So, keep bitching like little kids, cause I don't give a
rat's ass.  Pathetic that you people waste your time on a thread like this
that doesn't concern you...  Go get a life.
