Are you certain that this is how it works?  I would expect that if you buy
the first level of regen, then you will get 2 additional points of HP back
per tick, over and above your racial norm.  If this is not the way it works,
then, yes, it needs to be fixed.  I do not agree that you should get double
the regen for the AA points.  The other thing I question is whether or not
it costs you more for AA points than it costs others.  Your cost to level is
higher, but that does not mean that your cost for AA points is also higher.
As I understand it, each AA point costs a fixed amount of xp, which is
equivalent to leveling from 50 to 51, or 51 to 52, whichever it is.  The
question is do they base all AA points on the cost of a human leveling, or
on the cost of the particular race leveling?
