Just to let you know the real Reg LeCrisp is actually me. This guy
from comcast has been impersonating me for over a year now. I didn't
know he was doing it anywhere other than rec.games.ultima.online
though. 

Sigh, I've only been reading here a little while and I've never even
been to the everquest group. How nice to have my reputation
pre-ruined.

I post from Sympatico. Accept no substitutes. :)
