This is correct.  Many rares are up immediately, however others have
a delay built in.  On still others, they added in a random delay
factor, to prevent people knowing just when they will be up.
Still others are not static spawn at all, but reside on a list with
placeholders, and won't spawn at all based on the fact that the
server repoped, the chance that they did so is the same as
it would be when you kill something in their PH cycle.

The cleric epic mob was particularly annoying, as he would
spawn between 3 and 5 days after repop... and when they
do a "real" patch, this frequently cascades into "fix the patch"
patches for several days afterwards, each time resetting the
timer before he'd popped at all.

Sadly, I don't know any of the details you are looking for below,
although I think the minis and VSR pop instantly on repop.
