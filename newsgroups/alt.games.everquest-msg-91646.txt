Which brings to mind another question, we have been discussing here in my
little EQ community :
Is it faster to max out a skill (let's use Tailoring as an example) by
taking it in small steps? For example, if money was no object, could I
advance my skill just as fast by starting out making an item that trivials
at 200, as I could by first making something that trivials at 30, then
another item that trivials at 50, then 70, then 100 etc.?
Because, in a desperate attempt to max out my 2HB, I used a 2HB staff
recently, once I got the mobs to snare scare.(My 2HB is every bit as bad as
my 1HS). I could NEVER hit them, and I didn't raise my 2HB skill one single
point.
So that's why I was wondering if it was "too late", so to speak...
