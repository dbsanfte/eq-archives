I'd been soloing with my monk in Marus Seru lately.

Go out, pull something, beat it to death, bind wound to half, wait for mend
to pop, mend, and repeat.  It was nice, steady exp, but it had a slight
holdup at waiting for that mend button to pop.

Then my wife says "Hey, you're about the level of my druid, let's group."

It was non-stop death-dealing.  She'd pretty much med, heal, snare, and keep
a damage shield up on me.  I'd beat the mobs to death.  Even with the exp
split, I was moving faster than I was solo because there was no more
downtime waiting for mend.

I got through level 29 in one 5-hour play session.  As in, I leveled, then 5
hours later leveled again.

So I'd recommend monk/druid, but if you're looking for something different,
monk/shaman would work too.
