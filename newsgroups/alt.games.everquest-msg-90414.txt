  Because it's a silly idea for a newsgroup.  First, many people won't realize
the newsgroup exists.  Second, it's a pretty narrow topic... guilds.  Granted,
there are a lot of guild related issues that could be potentially discussed, but
those fit in well enough here.

  The only reason a person would care to advertise for their guild and post
their manifesto, ect. is with the purpose of drawing interest from players
looking for a guild, or guilds looking for allies... and a general newsgroup
kind of sucks for that, since it's not server specific, like lots of web boards
out there.  You have a much better chance of hitting your target audience
posting on a server specific EQ web board, where "server politics" are discussed
along with general EQ issues among players who are all on the same server.
