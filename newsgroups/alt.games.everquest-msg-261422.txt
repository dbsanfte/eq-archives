Anyone know why they care about that?  I can understand that kind of
restriction when your competitors don't know that you have a product in
development, or don't know that you are at the testing stage.  But everyone
knows Sony is developing EQ2 (hell, they've given interviews about it, have
a website, and have shown it at tradeshows).  They had an open sign up for
beta, so everyone knows the beta is near.
