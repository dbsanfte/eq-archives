It used to be, before they made regular food and drink edible (so to speak.)
It was nice sitting with my warrior friends and being able to sip my berry
juice while they were downing that wisdom inhibiting demon rum :-) Now, I
think it is more a curiosity and possibly low end help in getting your brewing
started. Why bother hunting or buying snake scales for bog juice when A)
druids and rangers really shouldn't drink the stuff in the first place and B)
we already likely have stacks of pods and fruit?
