The EULA makes it clear that children are indeed allowed to
play the game, merely that adults must be responsible for
their presence there.  Your point is incorrect, rather than
"very valid" it is of marginal interest.

Children are not allowed to be in automobiles by themselves
in the state of Pennsylvania.  Does this mean that you are
entitled to kill any child you find in a car?  Hmm, well A)
you aren't entitled to do something to a child just because
his parents seem to think its ok, and B) his parents may
be in the car with him, I didn't mention that one way or
the other, if they are he's not in violation of the law at all,
not that this has any effect one way or the other.

Children play EQ.  With or without the permission and
supervision of their parents.  By the rules, or in violation
of them.  Simple fact is, they do.  So the question isn't
one of "should they be there" or "do their parents have
any right to get mad, since they should have understood
the risks" but rather the simpler one of "is it a good idea
to swear in front of children?"

Personally, I say the Brell with them, its better than
learning it in the gutters.  But thats not the question
you were trying to dictate an answer to.

Fucking Moron.
