I cheated. 

DLed the files (yeah, all 2gb) burnt to cd, borrowed an account key and
went exploring. Will be buying several copies soon as the shops get
them, just for the account keys.

Beats the hell outta me why you can't simply buy an account key online,
and just let everyone else worry about bandwidth problems DLing. Even
have online credit card registration, alongside the key input method.
Sure, it takes a while DLing that much, but that's not VI's problem.
Everyone would have to buy at least one copy anyway, since you can't DL
the whole thing any more, so they'd save making and shipping a
bucketload of CDs to people buying multiple boxes for all their
accounts.
