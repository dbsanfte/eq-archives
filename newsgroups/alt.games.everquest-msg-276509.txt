Hm, you say that as though it's different from what I said, so I'm
curious what the difference is.  I did actually think that AC past
the cap (1300 or so, I said) had some effect (i.e., was mitigated,
but not necessarily eliminated); I'm willing to believe it has zero
effect.  And I referred to it as "your chance of getting hit"; am I
getting confused as to what AC affects?  Does it affect how much
damage you take from a hit as well as the chance of being hit?  Or
even instead of it?

In any case, the short answer is still the same as what I said: AC
over about 1300 (ok, 1400) is nearly useless (maybe totally useless)
to monks, and that's what the AC mitigation nerf refers to.  Right?
