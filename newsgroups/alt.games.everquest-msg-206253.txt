If I understand this correctly all European Union member states now have to
pay Vat @ 17.5% on online 'virtual' services delivered from outside the
European Union. Don't those players on the new UBISoft servers already have
this Vat included in their subscription fee. So, why not have SOE re-open
the free /movelog service to it's Euro members - kill two birds with one
stone.

Just a suggestion and I'm probably waaaay off the mark but if we can clarify
it I might contact SOE and suggest this to them - can but try :-)
