Primal Essence, the LOY 44 spell for mages, is a HOT, and one that I 
used a lot; not because it was highly efficient, but because of the long 
recast times on my other heals, it increase my HPS output to enough to 
keep pets alive while tanking unslowed mobs (course I have no slow, so 
most of the time if my pet is tanking, the mob is unslowed)

I've always wondered, though, why it isn't more efficient, as a tradeoff 
for the disadvantages of it being a HOT instead of a simple heal.

It also irritates me that there's only one version of the spell, the 44 
one, while clerics get useful versions of their HOT line over most of 
their lives.

Not that its crippling or anything, but its an interesting tool that 
appears long after we start, then as we level up it gets to the point 
where its pretty much useless again and never gets replaced.  Why bother 
teaching us how to use a tool that's only going to become a joke?

What would be the point of that?  I didn't expect something in line with 
the reduction of Unswerving Hammer of Faith (went from something like 
600 mana to something like 150 mana), but 5 mana isn't even a 1% change!

If I'd done that small a change I'd be embarassed to even mention it.

Hmmm, wonder if its droppable on FV?  Could be a little pocket industry 
generating charms... course you'd have to do it on a second account, as 
there's only one character per account, and if you don't have a second 
account to benefit from the charm generator...

Ah, I see, I've only been on a few days since that point and didn't 
think anything about the DS messages going to main; I think I have it 
set up that way anyway; all melee messages to main, spell casting 
messages and chat to a secondary.

But I did fool around with it back in the day, I guess when it still worked.
