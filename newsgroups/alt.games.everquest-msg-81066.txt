Is anyone playing SoL on a laptop? I will be purchasing one very soon,
and I am hoping to find one that will play EQ well.  The Dell i8100
looks interesting (but didn't they used to offer 1GB of RAM?).

I have heard, however, that the ATI cards in laptops are having
trouble with EQ. I don't know if that is just the Rage series or the
new Radeon 7500 mobile.  Are the GeForce2 Go chipsets handling it ok?

Thanks!
