Some less expensive options:
Braided Cinch Cord
Velium Rose ring
Velium Star Ruby Veil
Velium Sapphire Neclace
Gold Cats Eye Bracelet
Giant Scalemail Leggings
Molten Cloak

More Expensive:
GEB's
Pick a robe - SMR, Ice Silk (my personal fave), Bonecaster
Thurg quest Cap and Glove
Golden Bracer

I have had all of these at one point in time and still do have alot of it as you
can see:

All my stats are right but cannot get AC and ATK to sync up right. AC is 502.
INT is actually 266 but I haven't messed with him in a while and I need to
replace a few pieces for less INT and get some more AC and HP.
