     Somehow, finding a suitable poor thing and setting up the scene sounds like
it might take even more time away from my EQ playing.  And it may take a while
to pay off, too.  After all, this is SoCal, where we don't get older, we just
get facelifts.  Also, Lenny is going to be back in my RL, I think he might have
even more objections to this little, but ambitious, plan.
