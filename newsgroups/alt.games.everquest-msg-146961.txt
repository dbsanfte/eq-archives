I don't even know what the Wizards/Casters guild in Neriak are called to 
tell you where to start there.
I am pretty certain Wolf form doesn't work on the Neriak Guards and even if 
it did the druid will have to zone in with as it drops when you zone.
Getting faction with outer guard is pretty easy (kill the Halflings in 
Nektolus) getting faction inner guard and traders isn't too hard, it's a 
simple whine quest...getting faction with the Wizard Guild leader isn't 
likely to be as fun.

My only suggestion is to get a friend to buy them for you. You could ask a 
stranger to do it for you but it's a risk (expecially with so many Brits on 
the server) and you could end up losing your money...the other option is to 
find the approx cost of the spells, double it and offer to pay that for 
them at EC zone, pointing out the cost of the spell at a vendor...You may 
get some takers looking to make a quick easy profit.
