/sigh :o)

AB is in London, England...
2 Movelogs... hugely overcrowded towards the high-end

KB is in Amsterdam, Netherlands (that's Holland)
non-split... apparently there is a low population.


Then there's the Ubisoft servers...
Venril Sathir... English speaking, based in London (co-sited with AB, I
believe)... go, go New Dawn Ascended ;o)
Keal Drakkel... German speaking
Sebilis... French speaking

These are currently in 'open' Beta Test and are scheduled to go live
sometime after November 21st... when they will become (according to latest
FAQ publish Nov 5th) non-split servers, with the usual restrictions on
character transfers (6 month quarantine, chars will arrive stripped)

If there is sufficient demand, the 2nd server opened in each language will
be limited to a free /movelog of 1000, on a first-come-first-served basis.

Players who have already purchased the US version of PoP will have access to
the UbiSoft servers... new customers from EU countries will have to purchase
the 'new' Ubisoft Gold Edition of EQ (Classic, Kunark, Velious and Luclin)
and there will be a seperate Planes of Power available, compatible with both
US edition and Ubisoft edition games.



There... I think that covers everything ;o)
