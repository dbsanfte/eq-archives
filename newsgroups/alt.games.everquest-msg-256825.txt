I play EQ (and most games) with the sound off.  I just can't stand the 
repetitive sounds drumming at me again and again; plus I used to play 
while watching the kids when they were infants, and sound is a very 
important thing when doing that; little noises can mean a lot, worse, 
lack of noise can mean real trouble.

Voice acting in a game doesn't wreck it for me since I generally never 
know its there... but anything in the game that -requires- me to listen 
instead of relying on my eyes does wreck it, as I'm not going to hear it.
