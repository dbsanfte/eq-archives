First - here is a chart of weapon bonuses by level/weapon delay

http://lucy.allakhazam.com/dmgbonus.html

Second - only melee/hybrids get that - int and wis casters (Necro,
Mage, 'chanter, Wizard, Druid, Cleric, Shaman) do not.

Third - it's only on the primary hand, not the off hand (no bonus
for the off hand.)

So, if you are a priest or int caster, then simply compare the number
Damage/Delay of the 2 weapons.  The higher number is the weapon that
does more damage over time.

As for how much damage it does, that varies as you go up in level.

There are a couple of formulas, one is for the modal damage (the number
you see most often in a histogram) and one is for max damage (this varies
with str as well as level).  

Modal damage for the offhand of a melee, or any priest/int caster weapon 
is 2*damage

Modal damage for a weapon is ((2*damage)+bonus) - if you divide by the
delay you get a number that is useful for comparing weapons.

For instance Razor sharp claws are 14 dam/21 delay and a Waning Light
Katar is 16 dam/22 delay - which is the better primary hand weapon?

Note that for weapons of 21 and 22 delay, in the hands of a 65th level
character, the bonus is 14

RSC = ((2*14)+14)/21 = 2.0
WLK = ((2*16)+14)/22 = 2.1

So, the WLK is marginally better in the primary hand

As for max damage, I can't remember it, and it doesn't matter much because
those numbers are outliers in a histogram, and upping max damage (by 
boosting STR) does little to increase your actual DPS (damage per second).
