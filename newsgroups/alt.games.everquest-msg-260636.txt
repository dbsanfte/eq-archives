Point taken.  Like i said, I had reservations when I heard of the boards
existance too.  Theres a reason im not a part of the monkly-bus community
though, and if feigned didn't have the ruleset it did, the rest wouldn't be
a part of it either.

Call it discrimination against noobs! But hey.. we get no spam, no moronic
posting, no pointless race comparison shit.. all the plusses of a class
board, without the common downsides =)
