   You know, you seem like you might be a nice enough guy given the
right circumstances.  And you started with a valid point, imo.  There
should be some sort of balance struck where new and/or popular software
pushes the envelope a tad, else we might all still be stuck playing
pong.

    Believe me, I know that Dark Tyger is pretty good at pushing
people's buttons.   He's even gotten a rise or two out of me, and I
don't exactly have the shortest fuse around here.  But this whole
"You're a lazy slimeball if you can't afford a great computer system"
attitude you seem to be espousing is awfully off putting.  Believe it or
not, someone can be hard working, not blowing all their money on crack,
not be irresponsible in _any_ way, and still not be able to afford a
great system.  And I personally do not think that because _you_ happen
to have a nice box, means you are any better than anyone else,  even if
they happen to be using a Vic20.  

   So should EQ be geared towards those that have Vic20's then?  I don't
think so.  Should it accommodate people who have the very best machines
money can buy, and to hell with the rest?  I don't think that's
reasonable either.  And I don't think that that fact that you bought a
nice machine means you "deserve" a damned thing.
