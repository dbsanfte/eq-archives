Ohh I see, so what you're trying to say is that you're the sort of bigot 
who thinks that what goes on in other people's bedrooms is somehow your 
business?  Whassamatter?  Did his wife sleep with yours?

}Go to alt.swingers and do a google search for EQ from about a
}year ago, that's about the time they finally ran them out of that newsgroup.

So, you're teling me that alt.swingers is full of people who don't condone 
wife-swapping?  Now... that's just bloody peculiar.
