Misty Acorns have 2 uses that I have known of.
#1 They are used in some brewing recipies
#2 They are used in one of the Stein Quests (Stein of Moggok I believe)
As far as price.... My little halfling druid seems to find them continually
down in one corner of Misty and has sold for for as little as 5gp to as high
as 25pp each, it all depends on the buyer.  I usually wait to sell them
until i hear someone is in need of them on one of the /auction or /ooc
channels and ask them what they think is fair, this usually yields a high
price.
But then again I've also managed to sell giant bat wings for 5pp each and a
full set of buffs, so it all depends on the buyer and what they wish to pay.
