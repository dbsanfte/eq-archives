What is her race?  That may preclude her from using certain items.  What
items does she have now? Split paw gloves give +2 WIS and can usually be had
for 5-7pp.
Consider also mana items.  Until level 30 (or thereabouts) most mana items
will offer more mana for spell casting than WIS items would.  The benefit of
WIS items though, is her WIS-based skills would improve faster with WIS
items - but that comes with a higher cost.
You could help her do the Testament of Vanear (sp?) quest, which nets a +10
WIS +10 mana second-hand-slot book!  Many clerics and druids carry that book
well into their forties.
