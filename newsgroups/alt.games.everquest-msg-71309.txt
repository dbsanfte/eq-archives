What level is your Druid? If you can solo (or get some friends) and go
to Najena or Unrest, some nice lowbie necro usable armor drops there.
(Damned if I remember the exact names just now, but you'll know it when
you see it.) Otherwise raw silk will likely do you just fine.

If your Druid is uber and has a lot of friends, you could go for set of
Flayed. Even better.
