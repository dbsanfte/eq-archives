Had someone in EC (shock!) begging for items as he had just reactivated his
account. Feeling generous I thought I'd check what level and class and see
if I could help (thought perhaps a mid level character who had ditched all
his gear for whatever reason I could help with some spare items)

Hmmm, so how are we supposed to tell what he could use...I investigate
further.
/guildstatus Beggar_01
Beggar_01 is a member of Evermore

Riiight

When questioned about why he didn't ask his guild for help he replies that
he has been helped out enough already by his guild. Now he obviously feels
it's time for the populace of EC to help him out, I guess at least he had
the "good grace" to go anon and not obviously tarnish his guilds name.
