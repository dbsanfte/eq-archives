Or even a druid. Or even a 51 shaman... although I continue to maintain that
healing is -not- my job, I'm there to slow slow slow and anything else I
contribute is gravy.  Greater Healing as the main heal in POP?  The mobs hit
for more damage than I'm capable of restoring with one cast, don't be silly.

Now that said, I've done it several times since hitting 46, -if- I can land
slow, -if- the CC is there so there's a single mob being killed by the group,
-if- the MA can keep aggro while Stoicism is upon him, I can actually be
slower and healer for first tier yard trash groups; its a stretch but it
certainly isn't undoable.
