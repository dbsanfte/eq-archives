aahhhh hahahah  I hadn't even checked back on this post for a while, & I
must say I am quite surprised at the responses!   I was not quoting VI
rules, I go by server etiquette.  Must be different on other servers.   HH
has spawn areas as does Guk, Seb & a buncha others. These spawns get
"camped" & thats the way it is.   Sure, some noob can wander in & sit down
on a spawn spot & wait for it to pop & say *it agroed me! Now its MINE!* &
any decent group would just grab it back & kill it.     If I am camping a
spawn with my wife & someone comes & grabs my spawn, I sure as hell nuke it
& grab it back.  OHHH   he hit it 1st!     ROFL   If I can't get it back,
then I will send that player a tell & let him know (in a civil manner) that
the spawn is camped.  Usually thats that.  NP  (unless its a weekender
*shudder*)

EQ is made up of mostly groups or soloists camping spawns.  I have never
petitioned over a players behavior, there are better, more effective ways of
handling it.   One thing for sure is that although HH has problems like
that, like OS Paw & other lower level places, as we level & go to higher
level zones (like Seb, Charduk, ect...) these "KS" issues become rare.
People's reputations become more important..  Quoting VI rules, attempting
to force shares, frogjumping groups, these things really do matter post 50.
Players with bad reps don't get groups, get /guildremoved & cant get into a
good guild.

Quote VI rules, I guess his group KS'd.    OHh.... wait...  VI rules
again...  he should have requested a share 1st, worked it out, thats play
nice right?

regards
Bruin
(think I better save this post, I will prolly need it again)
