Okay I have a pretty nice Video card, Voodoo 5, and I want to play in the
higher resolutions, but I can only do that in the transparent windows or
with no windows? Would the only way to get the fully windowed mode into a
higher resolution is to change the same screen size option and shrink it
down?

If so, then I would rather play in the transparent window mode.

How does one med bring up the spell book when in the transparent view mode,
since there is no book to click on.

Also how does one change chat mode from group to say since you cant click on
the chat window like in the full window mode?
