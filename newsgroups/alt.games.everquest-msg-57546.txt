   Well the dust has settled and nearly a week has passed and seeing the
thread of responses prompts me to reply.   First of all the dwarven guild
has reamained eerily silent and has not contacted any of my guild (to the
best of my knowledge ) yet.  I assume that theyre just gonna go on with life
as if nothing happened.
                                       The good versus the bad.

The bad
     I, and o couple of my guildies have received private tells condemning
our action.  We have been told that it was in bas taste and that we should
not have atacked during a wedding.  These tells were very few however. On
the dwarven webpage, we have been listed as an enemy guild(ominous music yet
again) which means that their membership is forbidden from helping any
member of my guild( OOOOH Tragedy ).  On the list of villains I have the
honorable distinction of being number one.  Beneath my name is a list of
infamies and not nice adjectives that would make your skin crwal.
Unfortunately for them, infamy rocks too.
The good
   My guild is a better fighting unit for it.  Loyalty to our guild is at an
all time high, though loyalty was never realluy a problem anyway.  Not one
of my guildmembers had any problems with the actions taken and the ONLY
negative in that is disappointment that the war was ended too soon.   Guild
applications are flowing in nicely now.  Most members have received requests
about joining the guild.  Due however to counter spying we are only
accepting 6 of the applicants.  It's niceto be able to choose quality.  When
I speak of quality I can honestly say hihest quality.  3 of the 6 new
members joining are very well known on my server and will only add to the
prestige of our guild.  The prestige of our guild has escalated too.  Recall
that a year ago we were a stagnant guild losing our high members and
recruitong low members.  2 of those former members have expressed interest
in returning, but as it is a rule that once you go you cannot return, I am
unable to comply. Two guilds, (one of power) have expressed a desire to ally
with us.  One of which I will be considering.  ALL in all I would say that
the benefits to the guild have far outweighed the negatives and as this was
a guild related issue, I call it a success.
    As to the charges that it is innappropriate to attack during the wedding
I say this.  Where else is an enemy going to have the opportunity to strike
the high command and a good number of the troops as well.  To me it would be
the equivalent of not disrupting a Binladen wedding during Ramadan.  Yeah
the moment isnt right.  K it might not be the most moral thing to do.  But
ALL my trrops came home decorated and the enemy was brought to its knees.
This is war.  War is hell.  I laid it at their doorstep.  I can say with
reasonable surity that their guild will not be involving themselves in a war
in the near future.  I, however cannot say the same of mine.  Some of the
membership has developed a taste for blood and I think at this time, I could
lead them anywhere.
   As the whole issue stemmed from a lack of guild unity and a desire to
create a strong guild, I call the action a complete success. I dare say that
afterthe induction of our newest members(which will be done in Kaladim)  we
will be one of the strongest guilds on the server.  That folks, as a good
guildmaster, is my primary aim, and we have nearly achieved it.  I
appreciate all the support  and I even appreciate the negative criticism.
