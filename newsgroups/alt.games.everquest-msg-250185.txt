I've just started visiting PON as my first venture into the planes but
am a bit disillusioned they there seems to be no loot there ?

I've been killing the birds (blood ravens ?) .. the treants and those
spider looking thingies... so far have maybe killed 10 but not a
single one of the has dropped a thing. Zero plat.

I thought the planes would have decent loot and plat but it's not
looking that way so far. I need to save up to buy some better gear now
but with the creatures in pon not dropping anything i'll have to find
somewhere else I guess.

Cheers,
