Doh, trick I didn't think of: Reclaim the nearly dead pet.  Once, this 
would have returned practically no mana at all, since reclaim was based 
on HP, but since the recent nerf, it would have returned 75% of the cost 
of a new pet, at the cost of a second or two of additional pet life from 
me reclaiming before it was quite dead.

Not a huge benefit considering the massive ill effect of the nerf on my 
general mana flow... but I should have thought of it.

Splendid
