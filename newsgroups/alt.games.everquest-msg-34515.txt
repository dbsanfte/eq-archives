Not "on the weilder" necessarily.. many (as you note below) proc
on your target.  I can think of at least a couple, though, that
-sound- good, until you find that they -do- proc on the weilder;
the Traitors dagger, which spins you around if it goes off, and
a weapon I forget the name of, that procs Nullify Magic... again
on the weilder.

Most weapons that have a proc do so only if the weilder
meets a minimum level, I don't know what the minimum
is for that Lupine Dagger, but its probably not going to work
on anyone low level enough to still be asking what a proc is.
