No, it's not that simple. If it were, then the BABS would be the choice
hands down. However, since weapons with a delay of 40 or greater get a
damage bonus, that brings them closer together. Throw in the stats, if
you're just short of a crossover number in one category, and you might
want to go with BoX. However, for pure damage, the dmg/minute rating of
the babs still comes out to be a sliver higher.
