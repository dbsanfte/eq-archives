The thing is, if you are PvP on a non-PvP server, you cannot be buffed
or healed by anyone who is not also PvP.  Since the average server
has perhaps ten people on it who are PvP, versus a couple thousand
who are not, this definately restricts your possibilities.

Levels range from 1 to 60, and the viable PvP combat range is only
people within three or four levels of yourself, so the odds of finding
someone also wearing a PvP tag at your level are quite small.  PvP
doesn't give you experience or loot, it just sucks down the mana
and HP, or possibly kills you and leaves you with a walk to your
body.  On the PvP servers, there is the opportunity to loot your
victims for one of their items and/or their cash, at least.

If you want some PvP on a nominally non PvP server, you can
invite someone to duel; if they accept this makes you both
temporarily PvP, immune to outside buffs and so forth till the
fight is over, which happens when someone dies, logs, or
zones.

ALternately, you can go into one of the various arena areas,
which makes you free game to anyone; this is the principle way
you see more than one-on-one PvP action on a non-PvP server.

There is yet another option, the guild war, where everyone in
one guild becomes a target for everyone in another guild for
a specified amount of time.  I've never been in  a guild that
has done this, nor have I ever seen it done on Morel Thule,
but I did see it a couple times on Luclin.  Of course it could
be going on around me and I'd never notice if people weren't
talking about it in shout or /ooc.
