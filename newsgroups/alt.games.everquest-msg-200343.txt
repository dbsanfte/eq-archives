I suggest you get SOMEWHERE else. The mobs right outside your starting
city are designed for starting characters, so by level 5 you should
begin moving to other zones.  Getting a partner or a group lets you
take on tougher monsters, so you might be able to take on the things
that kill you if you get at least another person to help.

Learn to con the mobs.  Target a mob, then press "C" to con it. 
If it is amiable don't attack; it likes you. Faction can sometimes be
a bitch to fix.

If it is red or yellow, don't attack unless you have help.  Yellows
are a level or so above you and can usually be taken by a group of
players your own level. Reds -- well you don't really know how red it
is do you? -- so be prepared to die or get a huge chunk of experience.

If it is white and alone, you may succeed in killing it solo ---
depends on your gear. A trip to the bazaar if you have Luclin can get
you some nice gear inexpensively.  Sell spider silks in the bazaar to
get the money to buy the gear you want. 

If it is blue or light blue, you will get exp for killing it. Light
blues give much less exp than dark blues.  

If it is green leave it alone unless it has a weapon or shield you
want to sell or can drop silk to sell in the bazaar; it won't give you
experience and the cash it has will probably be less than the
experience giving monsters.
