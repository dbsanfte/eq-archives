Good God man, get a life. This is an EverQuest group. We don't care what, or
why you have a fascination for this guy. Please take this suggestion and get
help. No really, this cyber stalking is just plain weird. Have you re-read
your post?? You just searched through all his posts to find out at what time
he made the posts. Does this not sound a little obsessive??

And for the umpteenth time, quit crossposting.

PLONK!
