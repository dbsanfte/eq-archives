I wear a few pieces of Ry'Gorr but there are no Ry'Gorr boots. I wore
Dwarven work boots till I got the dreadscale. The boots are worth the effort
but just barely with the chance to get 1 or 2 earrings. BTW the Earrings and
daggers drop from the casters and mainly from the higher level ones. The
tabards and swords drop from just about any but the berserkers I believe.
Players are totally amazed that I wear 2 when they say they camped it for
long times and never gotten one.

Just to make sure I spent all my time working the 7 spawn ruin in the NE
corner of the zone. No guards ever come there and the wanderers are all very
low green so hardly any adds from your pulls.
