I mentioned social with my maby bard as I was referring to her abilities
rather than playing coversation abilities. Ability to heal, regen mana,
invis, travel quick and the relative lack of faction issues make bards good
for certain rescue jobs.

Also, sometimes I just like to sit back on a character and help others out
instead of the normal xp grinding. In the past I have logged on a Shammy for
this role but once you ooc you are buffing or healing at a location.

After playing a zone for a while you normally know who the
good/bad/solo/group players are. On the bard in the Paludal for example, I
would send the solo'ers (especially mellee) I recognise as not jerkish a
tell that that could pop over for a heal song at any time.

Every now and again you end up with a nice little healing huddle where your
just parked on your butt, mandolin in had playing a single song. You have
time to talk and get to know others players out of the pressure of an XP
grind group. A real nice atmosphere.

The jerky-boy instant gratification type have no time for bard healing
anyway, so you don't come accross them very often either.
