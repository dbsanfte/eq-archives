While passing time with not being able to login I am reading older posts
that I wanted to comment on

Internet Connection

I use dial-up because I live in the country..Not even 56k dial up..We are
talking 26.4 and sometimes 28.8. Amazingly I have no problems and no
apparent lag :))!

Graphics Cards

I am running a Radeon 9000 with 64 meg of memory..The game looks just fine
:)!!!

So resource wise I am grateful that I can run such a wonderful game with
borderline equipment.  As for Everquest 2 I don't think I will even be in
the same ball park to run that LOL
