Hehe, i owe you CAN actually work, believe it or not.

I zoned into SS once (Yvolcarn wanted to play, i didnt), and while 
medding up i talked to a nice level 60 ogre warrior about the bother 
with having to port to CS every time i had to zone to SS, and about how 
hard the quest for the SS key way.
He told me to go kil the dragon, but im on Thurg/CoV faction, so told 
him i couldnt do that.
Then he offered to go kil the dragon for me for the key. So we went to 
the dragon, i buffed him all up, he attacked the dragon, but some sentry 
addded, so after he killed the sentry we ran to the zone.
Zoned in again, buffed up again, and he ran and killed the dragon (i 
logged to clear aggro, didnt want faction hit for healing him), and i 
got to loot my key.
Told him he gets free port whenever im in zone, and he forgot all about it.
Ported him 3 times so far, no charge, and every time i thank him for the 
key again. :)
