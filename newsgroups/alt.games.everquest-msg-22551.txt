Getting a sow and levitate makes it an easy trip.  It's best if you can get
someone to cast them on you right before you zone into Tum or after you zone
in, so they don't wear off before you get to the firepot room.
The LOC is -12261, +4390.  Should be in the southwest area of the zone. Be
sure you have a  good map of the room so you don't end up using the wrong
pot and end up in somewhere you are KOS. You will see four spires sticking
up out of the water, just swim down to the base of the spires and into the
hole.  There is a drop to the floor once you enter the room, though I don't
know what damage it will do since I've always had levitate on, but it
doesn't seem that far to fall.
One other thing, there is a dragon that occasionally will be in the area.  I
don't know the spawn rate, but I was told that it's approximately every
couple of weeks (can't verify that tho).  I've used the room a load of times
and have been fortunate enough to never see the dragon.

I suppose you could swim the whole way, I've never done it that way.  Seems
to me it would be one hell of a swim, but at least you swimming skill would
go up.

1.While in the room, facing north, pots are left to right; Grobb, Oggok,
Euridin
2. Facing East, left to right; Neriak, Kelethin, Felwith
3. Facing south, left to right; Halas, Freeport, Cabalis
4. Facing west, left to right; Kaladim, Ak'anon, Rivervale

I've used every good aligned pot and never had any trouble.  Just double
check you are facing the right pot before you double click it.

Hope this helps.
