but like you say i probable have to upgrade my system, which means
motherboard chip memory dance, which is like always causes money to be a
problem SIGH. good thing ill be getting work soon so lack of decent CPU and
memory wont be a problem. will i be able to keep my Voodoo 3 running it
seems to be ok. dam the new ui default of lucin and not being able to change
it to the old one even if Lucin expansion is not present. any more
sugestions would be appreciated if the majority say upgrade time i might
have to try the pity of my dear old parents who live elsewhere. Thanks again
hope i get this fixed before the gamecard runs out SIGH
