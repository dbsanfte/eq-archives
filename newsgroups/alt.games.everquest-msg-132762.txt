Yes, exactly, and I thought it was a totally cool idea so I made a 
half-hearted attempt to put a bit more flesh on it. :)

Another argument for God's complexity/simplicity:  Genesis tells us that 
God created man in his own image.  Now, we could go up and down the scale 
about what exactly that means, but it seems to me that it at least implies 
that God is within an order of magnitude of as complex as man.

Now, being a remarkably self-centered species, we tend to have a very 
strong sense that we are very, very complex.  I mean, if we weren't -much- 
more complex than say, dolphins, how could we have achieved so much?  I 
mean, there's the wheel, New York, wars, and so on, whereas all dolphins 
have ever done is muck about in the water.  Conversely, dolphins may feel 
they are -much- more complex than humans -for precisely the same reasons-. 
(With apologies to the late Mr. Adams.)

Personally, I don't think humans are much more complex than say, a 
mollusc, or a redwood.  All we really are is a complicated way of turning 
food into waste, stored energy into heat.  Sure, we have really impressive 
and complex mating calls, and can have really, really, interesting 
thoughts.  But we really have very little evidence that redwoods don't 
have similarly complex thoughts.  Just because we don't speak redwood very 
well, and it takes them lifetimes to get through a sentence.

The most persuasive argument to me is, yes, this is a very, very, complex 
and interesting universe.  That may or may not imply a creator, your call.
If it does, it seems to me rather pompous to think that such a creator 
would give half a damn about the actions of some comparatively tiny and 
simple species like man, that will probably only be around for a mere blip 
on the cosmic timescale anyway.  He'd be more likely to be concered with, 
say, the morals of stars or galaxies, or the antisocial behaviours of 
leptons, than whether Crazy Hank the Plumber conformed to the norms of his 
society.  Or even whether humanity as a whole were a benefit to their 
biosphere, or destroyed it utterly.  Or whether the biosphere itself 
adequately processed the sun's light into entropy.  On the scale of a 
putative creator's interest, such variables are probably either way too 
small or way too big to be relevant.

If we assume a creator, it seems logical to me that He must either be 
simple, in the way that a quark is simple, or complex, in the way that the 
entirety of spacetime is complex.  Putting Him on the middle ground just 
doesn't make a lot of sense to me.  If He really -is- only interested in 
humanity and his works, why make such a huge and interesting universe to 
put him in?  What use could the quasars possibly be?  Is there really a 
point to the black holes?  Or did he just use way too large a beaker? 
"Oops, only got a 2-yottaliter beaker, I guess I better whip up an entire 
batch of universe..." :)  And, on the other end, there's the GUT, and 
subatomic particles, which both seem to suggest that the creation of the 
universe may have been a trivially simple act.  "Hm, one batch of quarks 
of various types and set a few constants, and there you go!"

But obviously, if it's turtles all the way down, there has to be a turtle 
that's closest to us, right?  And it could be turtles all the way up as 
well.  Maybe that's why humans spend so much time trying to shell each 
other over who's following the wrong turtle.

All praise great A'tuin.
