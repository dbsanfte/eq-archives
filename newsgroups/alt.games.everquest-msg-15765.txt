With the revamping of several zones has come great (as in "large", not "Wow!
Great!") changes. Runnyeye is certainly a whole new ball game now. Putting the
better loot in there has certainly turned it into a farmer's paradise, sadly, so
full groups of lower level characters who could get good xp will likely have a
harder time getting a shot at those items.  Also, when the type/level of mobs
change, the "ideal" player level to tackle the dungeon changes. I expect this is
going to settle out as a higher level dungeon than it was.
  Other recent changes have made various zones a "whole new ballgame".  Najena
on the top floor used to be *THE* spot in Eastern Antonica for low/mid teens
clerics and pallies and such. Plentuful undead, along with other mobs in a
fairly consistent level range.  Good hunting in a relatively small dungeon floor
with a zone you could easily run to when in too much trouble.  Now, suddenly,
there are four big ass skeletons that range up to as high as level 28.  Unless
there's a higher level person in there killing them off for nobleman hilts or
xp, you've got a lot of very surprised (and often very dead) mid teens players
in there. Three of the skellies are either in the entry area, or in aggro range
of the paths to the rooms with the fun mobs in them. (Tentacle terror room,
elemental room, hall leading to bonecracker and traz.)  The zone is no longer a
very safe place for the levels it once was.
   They yard in Unrest is in a similar situation.
