Apologies if I misunderstood. You seemed to be unhappy
about being unable to offer the service to your friends.
That struck me as skewed, but it seems I was wrong
about the position you were taking.

I can understand both motives. It's nice to be able to offer
something; having that something given away for free
feels unfair, even when there's no real loss. If I've offered
somebody a rez, and they get one elsewhere, I feel cheated -
even though I've lost nothing and presumably the rezzee is
happy. But human beings aren't entirely logical. Including
myself.

I actually agree on this, believe it or not. I play a Cleric as my main;
I don't mind rez requests when I'm ungrouped, will even hunt down
the corpse, but they are a *royal* pain when grouped as my downtime
becomes *group* downtime, which is just unfair. When grouped, I'll
usually *demand* a donation and split it with the group (or at least
ask if they want a share). Whereas normally I'll rez for free (to the
extent of cancelling a trade window with cash in it) when solo
in the same zone.

In any case, I'd usually prefer it if people could get a rez elsewhere
and leave me and my group alone. :-)

The situation is almost exactly comparable to the situation with Druids
and ports. (Except that for a PoK port I'd have to run several zones first,
which won't work for rezzes due to corpses not being able to zone.
But the PoK graveyard may balance this to some extent.)

You were given the level-58 (?) 3000-HP heal not too long ago.
I'd hardly call that nothing; it's made high-level druids much more
attractive for the high-end game. Admittedly in levels 40-57 or
so Druids have become much less powerful recently, due to
the Harmony nerf.

I must admit to an irrational sense of satisfaction with that nerf,
as the cleric Lull line has always been much riskier, and
clerics have less opportunity to run from a bad pull. But that
feeling *is* irrational - having the spell available to druids
didn't cost me anything, and made the game much easier
for druids and those grouped with druids.

At the very high levels, clerics have lost their monopoly on
healing... but Yaulp V and the proccing hammers have balanced
this to some extent.

Very true. I don't have any real experience with the high-end game
so I don't know how useful the Druid "Jack of all trades" is at
those levels. Certainly in the mid-levels it looks like druids are
finding it harder to group. (Of course a cleric/druid duo is
difficult to play well, so it's not something I've had much chance
to judge.)

OTOH, Druids are *much* easier to solo than clerics. <shrug>.

I get the feeling that people are thinking you're being
less reasonable than is actually the case. :-)
