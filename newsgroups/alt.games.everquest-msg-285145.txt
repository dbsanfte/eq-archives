 Not gonna happen. Eq doesn't have the numbers WoW has nor do they
bother to enforce their rules even when you provide all the required
information regarding the offending player. They don't care.

In short they want subscribers money and banning defeats that. The
plat farmers and other bastards that ruin EQ most likely have multiple
accounts.
