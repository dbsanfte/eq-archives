That's what I understood so far, from discussions on
bigger raids (necro is my main and only character above 20),
though I haven't even been on a planer raid (you might have guessed)...

And that's what I really dislike, but I kinda guess we have to pay
a price for being able to solo reds (depends on the kind of mob, yes)
through almost all the levels...

What I think should primarily befixed, and could, without
makind necro that much too strong, is the pet pathing you mentioned...
Plus I would be willing to lose some nukes and therefore make necros
pets the strongest pets in game...
Because I really think that necros are - from traditional fantasy p.o.v. -
THE pet class, before all others....

Maybe even decrease power on our dots, to get us better pets.

I don't want to just sit back and relax while my pet is doing all the
work, but at the moment, without even bothering to pull a pet,
for a necro at my level with Jboots, its just:
pull a blue up to yellow con with Darkness, and
either it sticks, and you own them, or it gets resisted and
you'd better run....

I don't need to be _that_ powerful without a pet, but then
make a pet more of a use in dungeons and plane raids...

OR - but that concerns all casters - make mobs less resistant
to damage-dealing magic....

Where's the sense in all those great dots, if not a single one
will do any good on an uber mob?


Just my 2p,


   Lars
