Well yes, I could do this, but to me, when I *know* that my Legends account
is still active I'd feel a bit cheated paying to play on Legends yet playing
on my old server. I just really want to cancel out of Legends, move back and
get back to a stable economy, good friends, a decent guild, and to me, a
better playing environment.

Thank you though ...

Stevie.
