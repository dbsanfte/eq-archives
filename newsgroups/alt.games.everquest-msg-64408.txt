I had a feeling the patch servers would be clogged today but you'd
think Verant would have also been expecting this.  What a bunch of
doofheads.

On top of that, they include print on the bottom of the box so small
you need a microscope to notice that...SURPRISE!....are going to
charge us "additional fees" for playing Luclin.

What conniving corporate shills!


Ok, I feel better now.
