I posted about this earlier but my news server did some nasty things recently so
I'm not sure if the post made it to the group.
I have a level 9 Gnome wizard and what I wanted to know was, are Area Effect or
Personal Area Direct Damage spells worth having and, if so, what would be the
best level to start using them?
Also, is it worth getting Shadow Step if you've already got Fade?

Thanks in advance. :)
