Why assume that?  They give no indication at all, seems stupid to me
to bitch before you have the first clue that there's anything to bitch
about.  And before any Necros/SKs jump up to whine, I have no sympathy,
my Snares and Roots had Extended Affliction, Affliction Efficiency,
and Affliction Haste nerfed out from under them months ago.  They
overlooked you guys the first time around, so you got lucky for a while,
pretty pathetic to whine about them finally noticing that they only hit
half the target they were aiming at.
