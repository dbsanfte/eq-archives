    Doesn't even have to be "buffed to the gills", though. Join group, put
up HB, if you have it and you think it might be needed / will pay for itself
with efficient CH's put up symbol/Naltron's Mark. Well over 500 mana -
having clarity so I can recover that might help, since healers are the
weakest link in the downtime cycle. Whereas putting 50% haste on all the
tanks is only as efficient as a 33% slowdown at reducing downtime, which is
Tepid Deeds at the level an ENCH first gets it.

    Heh, define "need". Requires, if all things go according to plan? Sure,
/agree. But desires to the point that they'll start doing dysfunctional
things without it? Hmm. My rogue is a sissy - level 54, still in all
Ravenscale (so mid-800's base AC), 1600 HPs base or so. With HP buffs, I
pull Velk's spiders non-stop. With full buffs, I main-tanked for one group
that couldn't find a tank to save their lives. As soon as one healer decided
I didn't need HP buffs, I stopped pulling. I'm not going out to find things
that double for 100 and backstab when there might not be a tank in camp to
evade onto when I get there, and when /disc counter only lasts 6 seconds.
Did the group suffer because there wasn't multiple pullers? You've been in
Velk's when it gets busy - what do you think?

    One of the biggest functions of a cleric is morale officer. "Ah, the
cleric is here, nobody will die!" Even if you know your class and abilities
to the point that you're confident in everything you do, don't assume the
others in group with you are too. Well, unless you brought along guildmates,
in your case. 8)

    Must be nice. Me, I end up in whatever group I can get in, so I have
bards main-tanking that don't know how to hold aggro, or knights without
haste items that think spells are for special occasions only, or even better
I pull and come back to find I'm the only tank that's back in camp. Or the
second spider comes in behind me, what with the weird corner pathing, and
decides since I'm closest that I'm the snack food of the day.
