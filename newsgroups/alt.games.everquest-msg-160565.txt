Well, if the PHs are as weak as you say, yes a full group could
easily handle it.  And if the AC is 35ish a trio of Warrior,
Cleric, Wizard might be able to cope.  But you did specificly
say <not> SRo, and you did specify the trio, so the full group
and SRo examples aren't germane to our argument.  :-p

Well, a 34 Wizard is a lot more powerful than a 29 Wizard, and the
difference in strength would be most obvious when comparing their
ability vs. a 35ish mob.  And I've certainly never seen any char
under 35 or so with JBoots who wasn't a strikingly obvious twink.
So I'll stand by my original statement, and if ever I meet an
exception I'll apologize to the individual in question should they
be offended by my generalization.
