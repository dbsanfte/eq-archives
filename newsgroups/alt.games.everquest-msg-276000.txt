Personally it's exactly what I thought it would be, more quick and easy 
dungeons with extra items that you can only get by buying the pack.

There are so many bugs and details that need completing it annoys me that 
SoE are putting resources into this at all. I could name at least 25 
problems with just the carpenter class, will these getting fixed, no lets 
just create a new dungeon instead.

I'm amazed at the lvl needed to play this as well. My highest guy is 24, I 
would have thought that if SoE wanted to add extra content it would be for 
15-30 level players, not the people who rush through the game power 
levelling.
