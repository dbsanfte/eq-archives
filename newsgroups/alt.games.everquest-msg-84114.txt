What a lovely discussion. Of course, in this case (as somebody who's
actually had to *work* at the endless process of getting a guild [x2] in
synch enough to get anything accomplished) it's pretty obvious. Biz, you
state you've *never* been in, nor shall you *ever* be, in a Guild. I'm
thinking you might not be the ideal expert witness to call in on this
one.

We catch somebody running around without guild chat on, there's going to
be some discussion. It's nothing at all to mentally filter out all the
"blather" but still be able to be on the lookout for when somebody
shouts to the guild, "RAGEFIRE HAS SPAWNED. DROP EVERYTHING AND GET HERE
NOW!"

You can't be bothered with that kind of "blather"? So glad you took the
time to apply. Good luck in your solo career. :-)

Let's assume you *were* guilded. When exactly would you turn guild chat
on? When *you* needed something? And if you didn't, and never know
what's going on unless somebody sent you a /tell, why exactly would you
be in this guild again?
