I was wondering if anyone would want to trade a City Of Heroes account
for a EQ account?

52 DE necromancer (with Jboots)
32 bard (with Jboots and mask of deception)
and a 15 rogue all on Rallos Zek
Plains of Power, Legacy of Yekesh, ruins of kunark, shadows of luc,
scars of velious enabled

I dont play EQ anymore and just want to try out City Of Heroes

Anyone up for a swap?
