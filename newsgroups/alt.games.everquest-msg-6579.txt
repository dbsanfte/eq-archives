Am i lucky or what.... i come home from work, and connect my business laptop
next to my home machines. I can play AND use e-mail, icq, eq-websites, etc
at the same time..... usually i do not even bother to connect it, but if i
know i'm gonna play for a while, and i need the maps or the quest-info....
i'll just do that.
