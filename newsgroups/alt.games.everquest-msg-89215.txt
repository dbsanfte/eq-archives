Thanks for the very quick answer.  I found in Paludal I could solo pull from
the bandit camps and handle 3 blue bandits at a time if over half full on
mana. Pulling single blues was almost non stop for about 5 in a row before
needing a med - I love this class : )

I think I will try a similar starting method in this zone as it sounds very
promising. Normally I search for a camp with an add free area nearby to pull
too. Then I watch others to see if particular mobs from the camp can be
peeled away relatively ease without disturbing the whole mass - most people
don't mind if I let them know what I am doing, especially if I throw a few
heals around during thier downtime. In zones with camps that can't be
"peeled" I just pull wanderers to a relative safe spot.

Thanks again - sounds like a nice zone : )
