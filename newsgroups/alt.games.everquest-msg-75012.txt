500pp per hour with invis? hmm dream on.
Get a few more levels with the wiz, and go kill hill giants in RM. maybe if
its not busy you can quad them.
If you want money now, running ports would be as fast as anything. Go sit
outside velks and charge 50p per.
A lot of people there want porting to trak area (sebilis), and im not sure
when/if wizards get that port.
