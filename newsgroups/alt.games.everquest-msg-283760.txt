Because as everybody knows, better graphics means better game.

I played EQ2 from the day it came out, after playing EQ1 from the velious 
expansion.     After 6 months of playing EQ2, i left , the game, dynamics 
and everything but the graphics were nothing compared to EQ1, which i 
returned to.  Don't forget that whilst EQ1 might not have the best graphics 
in a MMORPG, it does have years and years of content and a very good 
lore/background to it, it also seems to be sparse of the kiddies that WOW 
has attracted and in my opinion after playing Meridian59/UO/EQ1/EQ2/WOW, EQ1 
still gives me the most fun.
