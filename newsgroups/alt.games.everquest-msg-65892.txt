Yes, as far as  I know, in the UK it is the retailer that is at fault if
your game does not work (under the  conditions stated on the box), however I
think that they must offer to repair or replace the item (customers choice)
or offer a refund. If the servers have changed and you have Windows95 then
it is no longer fit for purpose. I am not sure how long this would last - at
least a year but probably not much longer.

As for the $10 per month, again if you had paid in advance then you should
get yer cash back, but as for everything else, I think it would be safe to
assume that you have had the utility provided, and no claim could be made.

Imagine if by some freakish luck someone "did" successfully win a case
though! Hmm Sony have to pay a small amount out to a load of people..say
$100 to 400000 subscribers..result big hit on the accounts - head bean
counter tells em to switch off the servers.

1 person..yay! I won I got $100 !!  I pwn j00 Verant
399999 people...aaaaaaaaaaahhh..no EQ!!!
