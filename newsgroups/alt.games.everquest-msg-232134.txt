Beta server was brought down yesterday (which meant test server
essentially crashed without warning just as I was about to get a flag
I had been trying for months to get, farkin GMs) so apparently
everyone had to bring themselves up to directx9.

I guess it might become a requirement from the expansion on. I
actually thought it had been required for a long time now, guess not.
