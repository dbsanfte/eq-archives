Dont try to convince them Martin, they dont get it, never will. 

Most of these people are regurgitating furor's "sound bites" or just
flat lying. Monks know whats happened  and as time goes on most will
not be on. Seen and heard of many raids this week where NONE of the
monks were present or on as alts as I was. Most of these had.... well
lets just say bad pulls, CRs from hell, and/or TPW.  SKs just were not
made to do this as well as monks and many wont touch the job on
difficult pulls without a lot of convincing. Good luck to them though
they will need it.

As for myself yesterday was my last death march ie last pull . My only
regret is the time invested and deaths to deliver good pulls to these
people that have turned on us out of jealousy. I urge no one to follow
suit although many have and many more will. 

The one thing that upsets me slightly is that they, verant developers,
will blame all the cancellations on the 48 Hours piece when the real
reason will be people have had it.

Good luck to you Martin  if you continue, and perhaps someday monks
will be fixed, but I somehow doubt this will be the case. Either way
Ive done with verant, they are destroying the game piece by piece and
theres nothing we can do about it. So instead of clinging to a sinking
ship I will let everything I've done the last year rot in a canceled
account. 

To the brainless that means no you cant have my stuff, doesn't even
really belong to us anyway. So post your barbs, throw the smart assed
comments, wont matter cause in the end you wont be playing EQ much
longer, and theres nothing you can do about that.

Good luck monks it was a hoot and the best class to play see ya on
another game one day perhaps.
