Yup! the caverns rock, i made 4 levels very quickly and must have made
approx 12kpp and still have a few items in the bank.

A tip for those wishing to go, the orc miners drop stackable velium bits.
KEEP THESE! Very high level chars come into the zone and offer serious
amounts for them as they are a pain to farm and essential for the new
tailoring recipes
