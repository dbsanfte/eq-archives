Gonna tell you a little secret.  While downloading patches happens at near
lightspeed it seems on various broadband connects, recently while my local
@home provider was doing router upgrades, I had to resort back to my 56k
dialup for a couple of weeks.

Difference playing EQ on a P3 1GHz on 56k instead of 3mb Cable - zero.  The
zoning times are *no* different on my side, and if there is a difference,
it's so unnoteworthy that I can't detect it.
