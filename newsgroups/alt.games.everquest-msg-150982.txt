Hi folks !

This last patch sux my wetass   !!

EQ aint working 12 h after cause i get still lockups, freeze and soo
on..cant see mobs closer then 10 yards.

And cause of a bunch of whining druids, Clerics aint needed any longer
betwenn 50-59.

1 exemple, in KC you often see chars from 48-60, if you get a 58druid who
can heal for 2900 if you got a Tank around 55 he prob have somewhere between
2900-4k HP ( depends on race and gear )
Who the heck will need a Cleric here then ?
Ok for rezz but if you got a good pally he can do that job and help with
kills.
Soo now to the point what shall the clerics do ? shouldnt they be the
healers ?
Why do druids got almost all advances now ?
exempel: Druid - Wizzi

Druid: Got sow, regen, heal ( almost CH nwo ) DOTs, pretty good DS, can
port.
Wizzy: no sow, no regen, no heal, no DOT, DS that do 5dmg at lvl 39 ( where
i am now ) and can port.
Ok i blast harder, but as all know root is best when you just blast and can
outrun em but root dont hold target soo good.
So i get smacked alot but cant heal or use regen.

Its not about wizzi ->Druid thing its just that when they got them to heal
2900 now they stealing Clerics job and they will be sitting like ducks LFG,
and they cant solo aswell as druids.
If they get ( almost CH ) then remove ports, Sow or regen.

My guild lost one cleric right after patch because of this and that will be
others too.
