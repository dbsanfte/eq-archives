The /con system only tells you relative *level*.  But as you've
discovered, some types of mobs are a lot stronger (or weaker)
at a given level than others.

And it should be no surprise that *giants* are stronger than
equal-leveled rats or whatnot.

Just wait until you meet dragons...

Learning which mobs are stronger/weaker for a given level
(and which other abilities or weaknesses they have versus
other mob types) is all part of the bigger picture of
learning how to succeed in the world of Norrath.
