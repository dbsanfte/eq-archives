so how *do* most guilds do this?

i was in a guild, 2boxing on raids, and my alt got the same dkp as everyone
else

but i was told that my alt would never get to loot anything .....

however, that was *after* i told them that i was 2boxing (they didn't know,
or they didn't know quite who was 2boxing who)

anyway, the dkp wasn't completely worthless because on one random PoFear
raid, i got to loot the tear for my shammy's epic (completing it) because my
shammy had higher dkp than another shaman (who was a main) . . .

my shaman was often the only shaman at raids, so shaman buffs fell on his
shoulder's (and that can be a real pain)

so how does it work with other guilds? other servers (mine is horrible at
the high end) ?

curious,

fenninro.sanbo/faza/90 other bots
