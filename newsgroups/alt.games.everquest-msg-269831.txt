The Steelwarriors arguments derived mainly from extensive parsing done by
folks like Bruutal and Frodlin.  I trust measured numbers way more than
RandomDev_00 saying he "knows" the formula.  Fenyman once said "It doesn't
matter how smart you are or how beautiful your theory is.  If it doesn't
agree with experiments it's wrong".  For a raid war at the end of a ch-chain
the only question is "Do I have enuf hp to live to the next ch?"

Seriously tho, as a rule of thumb, if your getting hit modal is above the
mean, go for AC, if under HP.
