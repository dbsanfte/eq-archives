Ok, so the Bloodsabres hate me.  I don't hold it against them, I'm sure I 
gave them good reason at some point or another.  But, it make is where I 
can't start on my epic.  I've done parts here and there, but I can't get 
Jeb's Seal because of a faction issue.

Short form: Talk to a gal ( on Bloodsabres Faction ) in the Qeynos 
Underground, and get Empty Ink Vial from her.  Take it to LGuk and charm 
the Scribe and give it to him and receive Ink of the Dark.  Turn in the Ink 
along with 2 other items to get Jeb's Seal.

Pretty straight-forward, except the bint and all of her friends in her area 
( quite a few of them ) all hate me, I guess because I have a sweet-looking 
tinted robe and they don't.  I think she's level 61, can't remember off-
hand.  No chance I can charm her even if I could split her away from her 
posse.

So, I know that I can have someone else get the vial from her, charm the 
scribe, then MQ Jeb's Seal with me.  That requires an Enchanter who is OK 
with the Bloodsabres who doesn't mind spending the time in LGuk with me.  
Unfortunately, the chanters I know aren't in good with the Bloodsabres.

The big question: If I create an Evil enchanter on my 2nd account and get 
the vial, then take both of us to LGuk, ME charm the Scribe, can my Mule 
chanter do the turn-in with indifferent faction to the Scribe and get the 
Ink back?

I plan on trying this relatively soon, but won't waste the time if someone 
knows it can't be done in this manner.

My other options are to get that BS BS faction up, although it's bottomed, 
or have the Mule chanter become loved by the Dead frogs.
