I haven't gone from anything to anything. I'd still wager that the
majority of players play it *only* online. No, I'm not going to say
"you're right", because that would be saying WC/SC/etc are NOT online
games, and they most definately ARE. The fact that they can be played
offline as well doesn't change that.
