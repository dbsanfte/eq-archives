How the fuck can you "missapply" Darwins teachings ??
If you sit around, be stupid, let people mow you
over, run from war, over time, sorry, your genes
will be OUT of the pool!

"better" in what sence?  in the sence that it makes you 
"feel" good, or in the sence that it ensures survival
of the fittest for the race?  Shit, if the fate of
the human race gene pool is a bunch of "feel goods",
the race is *defenetly* doomed!
