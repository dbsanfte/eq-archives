Nawww, ca-mon now....
The difference being is that Herby's flood pants are a "visable" difference.
Its a visual difference as a result of his concious behavior - much like
thoes who dye their hair pink, wear high-heel tennis shoes, and have more
metal embedded in their skin than all the welded patches on my old work
pickup truck.  Can *he* "reasonably" expect to get equal respect/treatment ??
(er, well, outside of the metal detector people at the airport that is ...)
