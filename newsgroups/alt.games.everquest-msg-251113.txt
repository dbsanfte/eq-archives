rofl, you *can* gate into skyshrine by touching the port statue 
in the tower...but you do sort of have to be either invis or non 
kos to dragonkin as you pop into a courtyard full of them.

I happen to not be kos in skyshrine, and do my best to stay that 
way. I have the way through  Kael memorized and can run it like 
nobody's business ... sort of circumspectly sneak my way through 
until almost through then DA and run like hell woth a sow potion. 
I hate the invis potions, and sometimes don't bother with the 
gnomish vanishing device if I am low on charges =) That's how I 
got such good SS faction, killing giants on my way through=)
