  There's a quest in the Stonebrunt mountains that allows you to turn in
that weapon for another one that is identical, except it has a +3 to all
resists, which is kind of nice.

  For a better weapon, I don't know.  Screaming Mace?  Sap of Piety?  In my
opinion there isn't much reason to melee from here on out, unless you are
"porcupining" for Defense/Dodge skill increases.
