We've seen *some* of that, but sounds like not as much. (Then again, 
Tarrew is a really ancient server. In fact, our server was a split and 
merge server created from Povar and Tarrew, and we've been around for 
several years now.) Of our top three guilds (the ones who have killed 
Quarm and are fighting GoD) the number one guild still seems to be 
closed off and doing business as usual. The other two have both, in very 
recent times, posted to the server boards with open recruiting again. I 
know, through a friend, that at least one of them has been calling off 
raids on occasion for lack of bodies.

In the next tier down, we had one of the non-Quarm Time guilds just 
disband recently, though they immediately reformed in a much smaller 
state. It sounded like lack of membership online for raids was a big 
factor there.

Our guild is, intentionally, one of the smallest raiding guilds on the 
server, so the loss of *anybody* is noticable. And yes, recently we've 
had to app a few more folks. However, on our boards, there has been a 
lot discussion from people who are still playing "to kill time until WoW 
is released." And it's not a small number. There have been rather 
chilling comments from others worrying that, when WoW goes to general 
release, we could be screwed.

Yeah, I'd say numbers are declining. The thing is, I don't think they 
are declining that much faster (in terms of people leaving) than they 
historically have been. The difference is that there aren't enough new 
people starting to play. That might be from the age of the game, 
competition, or just a saturated market. I don't know. But if you keep 
bleeding off players from the high end an don't replace the supply with 
newbies coming in and up through the ranks, your'e eventually goind to 
bleed out.
