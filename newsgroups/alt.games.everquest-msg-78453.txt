 Rain/Snow has never stopped me from quading. Never.

Um... Wizard's don't begin by snaring one. They gather first, then snare all
4.

A miracle that happens with great frequency whenever I quad. I like those
kinds of miracles. Oh and again, Wizards don't snare each mob individually
ya dolt.

Hmmm.. Ignorance of how Wizards quad, the "difficulty" of pulling near the
Othmirs (I always do the quad on the beach. No Othmir agro yet). Blah, blah,
blah... Make a character on Drinal. I'll escort you to a safe place in CS
and you can watch me quad and maybe learn something.
