I don't think there'll be any problem using
a PCI GF2 card, Jazz.  NLX refers to the 
formfactor (shape) only.  Just like in my
machine, you should be able to remove the
agp card, slap in a pci card and be good
to go.  

Quick bit of troubleshooting advice if you
try this.  I think PCI video cards are 
sensitive to which slot their in.  (IIRC)
They prefer the top slot on at/atx boards.
Try it in the top slot on the riser first,
if that doesn't work, try the bottom slot.

I've been soloing my mage this morning, so
during med breaks I've checked the web.  I
sure can't seem to find any *decent* NLX/AGP
cards.  So the pci GF2 64mb card may be your
best bet.
