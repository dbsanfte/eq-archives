It should be pointed out what caused this.  Remember how every now and again
a patch will screw up and suddenly orc pawns are dropping like 50pp and high
level gear?  Well this happened on the Test server awhile back and nobody
reported it.  Now you could say, Why should they report it?  It was Verant's
screw up, not ours.  But this is the Test server where people are expected
to OMG test the code and report any bugs.  Well the GM's were all pissed
about this and were going to wipe all of the characters, but after an uproar
from all of the players on test, they "merely" did an equipment wipe.  This
was all told to me by a guy who has been on Test for ages and was actually
very helpful to the Necro that I started there ages back.  Anyway, just
thought I'd share this bit of info.
