Much better.  You made your point without whining, thus avoiding
my normal response to whining:  allowing my "inner asshole" to run
free.

Now to address what you said above:  argument by analogy is flawed
from the start.  It's one thing to use an analogy to illustrate a
point argued by other means (i.e. to increase the odds that your
argument will be understood), and another entirely to attempt to
prove a point with an analogy.  Analogies don't prove anything.
To make matters worse, when you rely on analogies to argue with,
you will find yourself reaching further and further out into left
field as the argument continues, making yourself look more and more
foolish (been there, done that, the T-shirt was full of holes).
So, instead of trying to think of an improved analogy, you should
work on the logic of your argument.  Improving your logic requires
you to examine your claims critically.  Responding emotionally to
external criticism with obviously flawed analogies that you hope
convey how you "feel" about it does not advance your argument.

Oh, and don't worry about responding "in kind" to my "insulting
manner"...  sticks and stones may break my bones, but a usenet
flame will never harm me.
