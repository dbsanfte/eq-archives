Yes indeed, it sucks with the most almighty suckiness of any
spell in the entire game.  With what other spell can you
spam dozens of players for an extended repeated period
of time, without even having to be nearby?

Griefers have been known to use the spell to get people to
abandon camps... other than this I've seen noone use one
for any reason.  If there is a use for the line on a PvP server, then
it ought to be a spell usable only there... but I can't offhand
think of a use even there.

Spam spam spam spam, eggs, and spam.
