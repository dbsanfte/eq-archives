That happens at times, and that sounds like a good plan on your part.  My
comment was more directed at Dan and him saying that they had to have at
least two rogues scheduled to show up if they wanted to have a chance at
having one there.  I absolutely agree that RL takes priority, and sometimes,
things will even come up at the last minute, and a person will be a noshow.
I think that we have one rogue in the guild that is CoM capable, and she has
never failed to show up if she has said she will be there.  We have
cancelled CoM once or twice due to the fact that we knew ahead of time that
she would be unable to make it.
