Basically, if you are not of a level that will gain exp (and I assume if you
are in group and one of the group is too high) you will not be able to loot
the mobs "special" drops. You'll still get the coin and usual toot but
nothing else. I believe it was enforced to try and keep low level zones for
low level characters. If you want an example of why this was done, pop into
the liberated citadel of Runnyeye and type / <enter> at 45 I am often the
lowest in the zone.

What I don't understand is why people complain about this? Even those
farming in Runnyeye said that the loot rules for level appropriate zones
were a good idea and that Runnyeye should have been done the same way
(Although I still think the zone is too hard for the levels it's aimed at)
High(er) level characters will still hunt newbie zones/dungeons for faction
but at least there is no point them taking the best spawns.
