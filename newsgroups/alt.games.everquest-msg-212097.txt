The zone entrance is in Sol B in a somewhat interesting spot neat
what is known on my server as "Bat 3".  Zoning into Sol C for the
first time on the night it opened (once they patched the entrance in,
heh) was also not unlike hitting Karnor's Castle on day one.  Trains
and bodies galore.  If you have ANY issues getting to the zone in
you're gonna die for sure inside.

Lootwise we got a decent MNK/BST two hander which rotted as it was
bugged at the time and flagged None/None, a really decent dual wield
class 1 hander for the mob it dropped off, some belt which was crap
and an ok earring with regen on it from the named spider ring event
mob which would have been nice for people suitably geared.  Keep
killing the little spiders to make her (with spiders it's usually a
her I find) targetable.

Everything resisted fire and some mobs summoned, not too much lava
but painful if you did fall into it.  Getting on for half the mobs
saw through invis but most of it didn't hit as hard as you might be
used to in PoP.
