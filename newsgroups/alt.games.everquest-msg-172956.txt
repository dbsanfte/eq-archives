The old ways of communication shall not be revered, but shall be used and a
new form of communication will emerge, and only those who have kept and
remembered the 4 forms of communication will persever unto the end. The
three forms of communication which shall be kept are spiritual, written, and
scientific visual which is my domain and which only I can read for now but
will be taught to all and used and enjoyed. Only the "one" who is the master
of all 4 will be the one at the end, one which has not been discovered but
will be discovered at the end of time which shall be in 1000 years.
