Nope, not at all.  Read the new CS policies.  Basically you can change
a surname for any reason as long as you don't violate the naming
policy.  Log on, make sure you're going to be on for several hours,
/petition to change your surname.  You should get a response from
someone fairly soon, explain your request (I would like to be Gnosh
Gnish instead of Gnosh Monster, as I feel Gnosh Monster is a silly
name), and then accept that they are unable to help and must escalate
to a senior GM.  Once a senior GM is available, they'll send you a
tell, repeat your reasons, and they'll change the surname.  Hell,
they'll even totally remove your surname if you ask nicely.

Arolpin
no surname needed
