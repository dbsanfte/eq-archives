You *really* see a point in requiring the player to mash the stupid sense
heading button 5000 times before he is able to tell which way he's going?
Requiring a monk to spend 3 hours doing nothing but falling over dead before
Feign Death is up to a reasonable level?  You really like that people sit
around and summon 5000 gallons of water before they're able to cast XXX
conjuration spell without fizzling 30 times?

I don't think anyone is really talking about the trade skills here, which
seems to be the only thing you're commenting on.   Just the stupid useless
skills and the really shitty to raise ones.
