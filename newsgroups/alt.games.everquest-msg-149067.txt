In the almost two years now that I have been playing, I have petitioned a
total of about 6 times.  That's an average of 3 times a year, or about 0.25
per month.  So, the CS cost for me would be $0.625.  So, your point was what
again?  Oh, double check that math by the way, 10 minutes would be $4.17,
bringing the cost of my petitions up to about $1.04/month.  So that still
leave them with $11.91 for paying the developers, maintaining the servers,
paying the rest of the staff, and a profit.  (Actually less in my case, as I
pay 6 months at a time, but still around $11/month just from me).
