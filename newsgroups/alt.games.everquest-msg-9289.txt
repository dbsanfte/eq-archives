I HATED grammar and English class.  Absolutely DESPISED it.  When I started
college I did not understand why - while majoring in Business Management
*yawn* - I had to take it.  It didn't seem to make any sense, and I was
rather vocal about it (but I did take the courses, I wasn't militant).

Of course, NOW the reason is obvious.  Good written communication skills are
an essential part of life for EVERYONE reading this post.  Much more
important than the trig, geometry, chemistry, world history, etc. they made
me take in school, though all of those classes were more to my taste.

I've always been a good speller (though I hated spelling bees, and I ALWAYS
have auto-spell check on, if given that option).

I didn't take an interest in grammar until I met a cute girl that liked it.
<g>  I'm NOT a grammar nazi...hell, if someone tried to explain a passive v.
active sentence (or whatever it's called), or tried to explain a dangling
participle I'd either shoot them or myself.   And I know not to start a
sentence with a conjunction (Conjunction Junction, What's Your Function?)
such as "and," and I know not to end a sentence or sentence fragment with
the preposition (at least, I think that's what "to" is) such as "to,"
although I suppose in this case I didn't just break the rule.

The only misspelling that I'd consider a constant peeve is "a lot."  NO ONE
knows that it's two words!!  ARGH!!

For most stupid abbreviations I just judge the person to be stupid, lazy or
where English is not their primary language.   Hey, I'm allowed.  There's no
debating it...I think they're (except foreigners) stupid.  Thousands of
people may disagree, but I don't care.

But yeah, I do tend to get a little tired of seeing people not drop an "e"
when they should, or not adding a consonant when they should.   I just hope
that they're in the technical field at work and never have to write
anything.  I find it hard to take anyone TOO seriously who doesn't even have
a basic concept of spelling or grammar (btw, I am well aware that this
sentence is worded poorly, but I don't know how to fix it).

Oh, and I make WAY too many parenthetical comments (although that's obvious
by now, eh?).

I think it'd be hypocritical of me to make too many posts about a subject
where I'm obviously lacking knowledge.  But yeah, occasionally I have to say
something.  Too many people think "poped," "dieing" and "giveing" are words,
and when *I* learned how to spell these correctly by 3rd grade sometimes
they just get to me (another badly worded sentence).

But hey, you asked. ;)
