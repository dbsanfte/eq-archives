It didn't have the same graphic as a wand of the ice storm. I know a wand of
the ice storm looks like, and other than being about the same color, it
looked nothing like it. The item in question looked like a torch made of
crystal or ice with flames (the same color as the torch, so I guess it was
ice or crystal flames) and smoke, just like a normal torch. Not those weird
`blue snowballs' floating around the tip.
Unfortunately, I was having lag issues so I couldn't take a pic or target
the person to get their name so I could ask them what it was, and they left
the bank before the lag spike stopped. :(
  Haven't seen another item like it since. So I'm assuming its either a very
rare drop or a prize from a GM event, or something.

(I see any cool-looking items I've never seen before, I'm taking a pic
asap!)
