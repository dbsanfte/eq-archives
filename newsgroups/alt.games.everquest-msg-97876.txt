Hmmmm, let's see ... I spent from 24 through 29 or so in Warsliks Wood at
the Forest Giant fort, first working the perimeter giants then pulling from
inside the fort itself.  Good XP ... loot ranged from nothing to a few plat
to the occasional Legchopper (36 plat in Rivervale).  In all the time I was
at the giants, one Forest Loop dropped.

At 29 the XP started to thin out there, and I went to the Crazed Gobs in
Butcherblock.  That's a great camp ... fixed spawn points, no adds, lots of
room to kite, guards close by, obscene loot for the level.  If the gobs were
camped, I'd head to Iceclad for snow cougars or Eastern Wastes for walruses
(walrii??).

Then a 34, you get Lighting Strike and Quad Kiting takes hold of your life.
Back to the spire gnolls in SK or Crazed Gobs to get comfortable with
quadding.  Quadding the gobs played out at about 37.

From there, I went to FV and quadded Drolvargs and/or camped the Forest
Giants near the Swamp of No Hope zone.  I still do that from time to time,
but my main focus now is Spirocs in Tim Deep.  At lvl 42 with a WIS of 189,
I've just gotten enough mana scraped up to be able to quad the Lightfoot.
Take care when working the Spiroc Provens though, run backwards while kiting
them.  They backstab for 300 a pop.

There are other things out there to do ... I'll sometimes work the Mountain
Giants in Dreadlands or Hill Giants in the Karanas.  I've also taken some
time out for questing WIS gear.

Hope that helps!
Crash
