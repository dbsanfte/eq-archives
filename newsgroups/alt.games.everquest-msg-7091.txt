I heartily recommend Cazic Thule.  I spent 15 levels there (granted, I'm a
SK and wanted a full set of darkforge, but there's still mighty xp and cash
to be had in that place).  I think it's a great
dungeon-that's-not-a-dungeon: plenty of sectioned off areas where you can
fight and not worry about other people's trains (except the zone and
courtyard, just the opposite there) and xp can keep you happy all the way up
to upper 30's, where you'll still get xp but won't be quite as fast.
All the lizzies are warriors or clerics (except the named or crusaders) and
many of them carry fine steel.  Being a fattie, you can sell nearby at the
outdoor ogre vendors and bank in Ogguk.  I also usually didn't have too much
problem finding groups there.
