I started at 49 and the malachite issue is an annoyance as is the pain in
the butt of having two pet spell slots - one for the combat pet and one for
the regen pet (I never fell in love with the 49 earth or MSII pet for
xping), but even before level 49 I was already carrying around two backpacks
of malachite (sometimes more).  At 49, I upped it to three to five backpacks
of malachite.  Leaves you less space to loot, but heck I wasn't whacking
anything that had nice drops anyway.  I haven't played my magician in a bit,
but IIRC I could probably go from one bub to approaching full mana in no
more than 10 casts (non uber gear - 180 to 190 int), probably 8 would get me
close.  I wish I had tracked how many malachite I used per hour, but I never
really considered it a burden - I never rushed through my entire malachite
supply in one hunting session.  I usually figured that for the 50pp I would
use for a C3, I could buy malachite and have mana regen more under my
control - I could determine when to do it.  With C3, I always feel pressured
to make the most of every minute.  If someone contacts me in game or out of
game, I'm grumbling because my C3 time is going to waste.  With pet-canni,
if I can find a safe place to put up, I can chill for a bit.


That said, elemental pact, especially, and suspend minion (not that I'll
probably see either AA) would take pet-canni to the next level.
