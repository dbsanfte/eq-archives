Silver plate would be Crystal Chitin, which in fact doesn't look silver on 
Humans, but dull grey, and that's the reason I'm not wearing more of it 
(well, and also because it costs a lot of money :). The plate I *really* 
lust after would be a full set of Golden Efreeti armor. /drool

I know there is a Druid useable whip, a tail from some wurm or another... 
If this is the one you are talking about, I didn't know it could be wielded 
in the off hand. I don't suppose it can actually be *used*, though. =)
