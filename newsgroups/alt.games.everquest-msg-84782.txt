    Before Hate was changed, we found that of the two mobs that guarded
Maestro (either a Spite or a Cleric), one would drop the class-appropriate
BP (Rune Etched or Ethereal Mist) like clockwork. Our guild wasn't the only
one that noticed this, too. I have NO idea if those mobs are still there -
haven't been back since the changes - but it's something to keep in mind.
