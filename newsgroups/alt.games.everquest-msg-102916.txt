any quest can be multiquested, the same code runs every quest.

which is basically,

1) wait for item
2) do i need item for quest? yes - goto 4, no goto 3
3) destroy item say "thanks"
4) do i have all items for a quest?  yes, goto 6, no goto 5
5) say "thanks", goto 1
6) say "thanks", give reward to whoever gave me this item, goto 1

even if you give a quest mob all the items, he goes through this
individually for every item you give him (yes, thats why he says
thanks 4 times when you give him 4 gnoll teeth).  Whoever
gives the last item and triggers the quest reward is the one to
get it.
