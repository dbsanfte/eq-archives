Yes England is part of Europe and we drive on the left, well done. This is
what Lance meant when he suggested that "Euro's" would train the wrong way
(left and not right) What Carlo was pointing out is that the REST of Europe
(you'll notice that the UK is a little, overpopulated, overpriced island off
the coast of France) drive on the Right (as do the US) so therefore by
saying "Euro's" he should really be talking about to the majority not the
minority (the UK)

Yes it would and it would also be foolish to mention television shows like
Springer, considering we tried to recreate the same program over here, as we
have with many US tv shows.

Not even close, Lance suggested that Euro's would turn the opposite
direction because of their/our driving laws, Carlo pointed out that the
Majority of Europe have similar driving laws to the US and drive on the
Right (Except Italy where the traffic laws just appear to be a FFA)
Unlikely a French man pissed him off, more likely an overly defensive,
misguidedly patrioc Brit decided to make something out of nothing.
