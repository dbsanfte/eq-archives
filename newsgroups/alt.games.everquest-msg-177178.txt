Here's my two bits on your questions:

Some ppl roleplay, others don't.  The Frionia Vie Server limits you to one
character and has been dubbed "a roleplay server".  The character limit is
to help keep twinks from poping up like daisies.

kewl d00ds and such still exist, but added zones seem to keep'em spread out.

Always a tough call, 15mins aint much time to do much considering what it
takes to get to some zones.  Pre level 50 sure, you could head into a zone
and kill some mobs and such, but getting groups usually takes time.

Some new features in the new Planes have graveyards that your body will pop
to once you die, xp loss is stil a pain, but the "new" CR's make death a bit
more palettable.

Guilds are important especially to high end content and zones.  They require
a certain finesse that is not for all, but their help can be pivotal in
bigger gear, loot and quests.

Not sure how bad it was, but many zones are now all-but abandon leaving them
free for the picking.  Everyone like new gear and platium coin, so that
greed is always present.

There is a great feature available with the Shadows of Luclin expasion that
will let you go AFK and leave your wares on display for ppl to buy.  This
makes many, many items avaiable to broswe and buy, and haggling does happen,
but not in the automated "trader mode".  Easy to get equipment with only a
few coins.

Sounds like you got a raw deal there, but Verrant is now solely Sony Online
Entertainment, and the rollbacks (when they do happen) only move you back a
few minutes, not levels.

Death always sucks, but with the risk the reward just aint worth it!

Good luck with your decisoin, it's worlds better than when I started, and
just keeps improving!
