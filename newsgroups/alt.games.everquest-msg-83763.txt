Of course I said that, but with all the foaming at the mouth, it was 
overlooked.  Maybe jaZZ will be able to not share his password with anyone 
other than georg, but right there he is sharing his password, with someone 
that he must trust.
The thing that really gets me is that Bizbee freely admits that he gives 
the keys to his house to a 15-year old kid, yet can't trust the password 
to a GAME to his closest and most trusted friends?  Folks, it's a game, 
the worst thing that could happen is that you lose your account.  It's a 
game.  People freely share access to their house and cars and personal 
belongings, but then become absolute tinfoil-hat wearing fanatics when it 
comes to sharing access to a virtual game world.  IT'S A GAME.  It has no 
real value (well, the recently published study on the economy of Norrath 
notwithstanding) and no real worth.  It's a game.  Sharing your password 
with people you trust is no more risky than sharing anything else with 
people you trust, except that I can't think of a single way that even the 
most slimesucking personal-injury lawyer could sue you for something that 
happened to your friend when he was using your account.  It's a game.
