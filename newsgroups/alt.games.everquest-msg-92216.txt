Sean,

Well there's a difference between picking up aggro while
fighting and leaving the party to actively pull something.
Bards are *very rarely* the right choice of puller for exp
groups, for the reasons you list and others. However, Bards
are used to pull sometimes in raid situations (multiple
groups, not for exp) when the following conditions are met:

+ The raid is in a zone that is considered to be "outdoors"
+ The distance that mobs need to be pulled is large
+ The mobs move very quickly (SoW+)
+ The mobs have a tendency to dispell the puller
+ Particular mobs need to be tracked for pulling

In these cases, the Bard's fast speed, tracking, and
immunity to being dispelled can be an advantage. Under these
conditions, I have seen Bards pull for raids in both Fear
and Western Wastes. However, no one should ever pull on a
raid unless they are very familiar with the zone and raid
goals, and then only if asked to by the raid leader.

> But my question is basically how true is this "I won't

It's really more of a preference issue than anything else.
And not just your preference, but what the party
wants/needs. Frankly, I think a Bard will always do the most
damage with decent weapons and will spend most of their time
with weapons even at high levels. However, I've played with
some great bards who don't use weapons often, and some great
bards who always use weapons. Maybe the real skill is
knowing when to switch.

(As a credibility issue my alt is a 53 Bard.)
