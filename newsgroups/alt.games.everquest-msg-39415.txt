Not quite true.  From last night in East Freeport:

[Wed Sep 05 03:28:12 2001] Orc Apprentice scowls at you, 
ready to attack -- looks like you would have the upper 
hand.
[Wed Sep 05 03:28:54 2001] You begin casting Minor 
Illusion.
[Wed Sep 05 03:28:57 2001] You feel different.
[Wed Sep 05 03:28:59 2001] Orc Apprentice looks your way 
apprehensively -- looks like you would have the upper 
hand.
[Wed Sep 05 03:29:18 2001] Your illusion fades.
[Wed Sep 05 03:29:23 2001] Orc Apprentice scowls at you, 
ready to attack -- looks like you would have the upper 
hand.

out early :)
