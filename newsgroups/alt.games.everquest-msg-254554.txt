I did some experimentation after the "radical change" and posted some
numbers.  Here's a link to that thread in Google:  http://tinyurl.com/5wv5n

The executive summary is:

- Standing regen is higher than it used to be; my monk in particular
  was getting 8/tick standing (unbuffed).

- Sitting adds a small amount to regen at first.  For casters, even
  the small amount can be noticeable, but for melee it's quite small
  at first.

- After 1 minute of sitting you may see a very small increase to the
  regen per tick.  After 2 minutes you'll see a much larger jump.
  Each minute after that adds another large jump.

Throw in bandages and the odd extra healing from Focussed Will or
Tribute or other buffs, and I rarely see more than 3-4 minutes of
downtime, and usually much less.
