OK fair enough for flaming me on that. I didn't mean to come off sounding
"im so uber", although it did seem that way. Anyways, my offer still stands
and anyone that wants to group is welcome to. I didn't mean to piss of the
"purists". So it seems im the noob har har.
So no, i don't have any high characters and im not that twinked, i did
accept some plat from a friend.
*Dodges flying tomatoes*

But I have had fun lately hunting dungeons, im really starting to hate the
outdoor zones. It's been much more fun getting a group and going to some
obscure dungeon that no one goes to. I guess thats the reason for wanting a
seasoned group.
