Tell me, where did he say that? Now, he does imply (and I quite
wholeheartedly agree) that the majority of immature twits are in
school. But nowhere did he say EVERYONE in school was immature.

Incidently, the classes you're taking and your performance in them in
no way indicates maturity. Maturity and intelligence are two different
things. I know plenty of highly intelligent adults (yes, even some
40+) who act like juvenile idiots... Frankly, the mention of the
classes is just pointless dick-measuring.
