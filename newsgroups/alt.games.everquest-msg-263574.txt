Automated selling doesn't necessarily ruin an economy.

DAoC has had consignment merchants ever since they added player housing, and
it hasn't killed the economy.  Comparing stuff from long before that to now,
it looks like the DAoC economy has remained pretty stable long term, both
before and after the addition of the consignment merchants.

Consignment merchants are expensive, though, so they are not something
everyone can use.  Perhaps that makes a difference?  (To get a consignment
merchant, you need a house (1p for the smallest, if I recall correctly), a
lot for the house (0.3p minimum), a porch to place the merchant on (0.5p),
and the merchant himself (1p, I think)...that's 2.8p, which in DAoC is a
lot.  My Necro could have done it by the low 40's, but Necros have almost no
equipment to buy.  Someone who actually needs to keep up armor and weapons
would find that to be a lot of money).
