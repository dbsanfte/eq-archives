Thing you have to understand, is that the servers are staffed by Volunteer
Guides.  That means they are players who volunteer their time.  They aren't
employed staff and only have hours that they volunteer to help out.  Some
of those hours don't always coincide with your hours.

Another problem, is the people you are competing with for a Guide's
Attention.  Remember, you are one in 1k+ players on your server.  That
means maybe...  1 to 2 percent of the population is petitioning about
something, ranging from Ksing, Training, lost items, broken quests, or
broken something.  In some cases, said people will either be slow in their
responses back to the Guide or GM in question, or worse yet...  Spend a
large deal of the time arguing the case to convince the Guide or GM
otherwise, and in some cases still not get what they want.  At the same
time, those time consuming petitions eat away at the time that the Guide
has set aside to help users.  And while you have been playing for 8 hours
and 30 minutes, some guides spend probably about 30 to 40 minutes with one
petitioner for one of the reasons above.  Or spending about 20 to 30
minutes trying to observe or get details on something in question.

Remember, these guides are players, not paid employees of verant.  GMs
don't pop on until around 3pm or so PST time, which is about 5:00pm CST,
6pm EST.  From there, you guys can figure out the appropriate time zones
from there.
