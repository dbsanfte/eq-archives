Honestly, I can't imagine why clerics wouldn't be overjoyed at tanks that
come ready-Temped.  The lower level spells don't last all that long, still
have a reagent, and cost, comparitively speaking, quite a lot of mana.

So what you're saying is that there's no risk at all anyway, right?  Thus,
any discussion of "strategy" as a reason for not getting Temp is just a lot
of hot air...

You have 30 levels and a couple hundred AAs to go before that would ever be
an issue.  =)
