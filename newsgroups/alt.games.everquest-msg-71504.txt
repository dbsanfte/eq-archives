I apologize jaZZ.  I am always in a hurry when typing and seldom take the
time to proof-read my post as good as I would like too.  On top of that, I
am not the best spellar<sic> to begin with so I appreciate these little "ass
chewings" to remind me in the future.  I will never spell "beggar" as
"begger" again after that little "butt munching" post I got a few months ago
and I suspect I won't be misspelling aggro from now on either.  ;-)

Orlun, Xev
