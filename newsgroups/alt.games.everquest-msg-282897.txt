Ninja looting does not have to be a non-group member, it could be
anyone.  Some people have given examples of ninja looting someone
elses kills after a timer expires but that's not the only case.

If a looting order or procedure is defined for the group and someone
loots outside of it, that's ninja looting.

If, in FFA looting, someone is always looting because they are right
clicking the mob as it falls, that too is ninja looting.

In both cases there needs to be intention to make it a potentially
punishable offense; intention to loot out of turn or before anyone
else.  Sometimes people just click the wrong thing or hit the wrong
button, no biggie if it's fairly isolated.

These are just my personal definitions but they've been widely
accepted in groups I've been a part of.
