Around level 16 or so I'm thinking about taking my
cleric over to the gnome city to do a quest for the
Iniates Symbol of Bertoxxulous. My cleric is a priest
of that diety, so I'd really like to do the quest.

Will he be KOS in the city in Steamfont?

I play on Vallon Zek, so I already know I'll have
a slew of gnomes trying to slaughter me. We all
know how those gnomes are!

Needless to say, I WILL do the quest. No matter
what I have to do.
