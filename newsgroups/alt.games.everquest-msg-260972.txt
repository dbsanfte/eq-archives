I think you miss his point.  He's saying that at levels 5-50 (or 
wherever you put the lower level range) the tasks are essentially 
impossible; kill a bunch of red mobs, meanwhile at level 65 they are 
relatively easy; kill a bunch of light blue mobs.

Since he's in the 5-50 range, the tasks system is unappealing, and since 
the rest of the OOW expansion isn't useful to him, he feels snookered 
because he bought it largely because the task system was hyped as 
something for people of almost all levels (tutorial till 5th, then tasks 
from then on) who are looking for soloable content.

I have no experience with the task system myself, so I can't speak to 
the his objections, but I don't think what you said speaks to them either.

Raiding old content?
