There was an argument on one message board where someone agreed that the Mud
term MOB meant Mobile OBject, but
that MOB in MMOGs doesn't mean that.
It means Man Or Beast.
This was a several hundred post thread.

I think he got that from a shadowbane dev he said.

The devs on the game we were talking about didn't have a clue where that
came from, they still define it as Mobile OBject.
