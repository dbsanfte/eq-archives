I don't have to make assumptions: The OP stated: "Sony has suckered
you and your friends into grinding grey cons endlessly for no reward.
And you must continue to do this simply to avoid punishment. Spare me
the RP crap about helping your city. Let's face it: if your a patron
your Sony's ultimate sucker."

It doesn't matter what else your guild does (assuming it has any time 
left over from "endlessly grinding greys".) Its also fair to assume from 
the tone that grinding greys is not particuarly interesting.

Apparently the distinction between them is too subtle for you. Here let 
me spell it out in small words:

1) I get that you want to display your tag.

2) I do not get why it is so *important* to you. So important that you 
are telling people not to play the game because of it. So important that 
if you do play the game you will be suckered into endlessly grinding 
greys.

> Make up your mind John Kerry.

The difference being that Kerry is accused of changing his stance on the 
same issue. I expressed two different stances on two different issues.

Of course, as far as actual flip-flopping... Bush did that too, from 
"We're gonna get that evil Osama" to "Osama's not really that 
important" back to "Osama is a top priority in our fight against 
terrorism..." but hey if it makes you feel superior to ignore that go 
nuts. 

At least you accused me of being Kerry, which given the US presidential 
canditates you had to choose from... I'll take as a compliment.
