Problem I have had is coming back down.  They combined the odus and
(?)velious, but don't always announce which one is next.  So what you have
to do is watch out for the (x)spire is casting message and run off if it's
the wrong one.  If you are not paying close enough attention you wind up on
odus and then have to wait for a ride up and then another ride down.
