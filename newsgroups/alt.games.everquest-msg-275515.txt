Yeah, I think its just carpenters that are having a hard time. My would
be provisoner is actually better of at his level (fuel cost 2c less)
and has no trouble levelling up and making pristines. Most of the new
recipes are white (even) and need few combines. In an hour I can make a
stack to twenty and get about 60% exp. No idea about the market value
since I normally use them myself but I'm led to believe food and
drink is a very lucrative market.
