I've decided to leave my Wizard for a while and start a new character,
really just to give myself a bit of a diversion. I've chosen an Enchanter,
mainly because people tell me that they're rather hard to solo at times, and
I love to solo.

So, to my question: From what I read, if the Enchanter pet does more than
50% to a mob, the pet gets 50% experience. My problem is, my pet seems to do
rather a lot of damage, which in-turn is stopping me from gaining full
experience per kill. As I have no control over my summoned pet, I'm
wondering if I cast a DoT, such as Choke, then root the mob before it hits
me, the choke will do its maximum damage whilst the mob is rooted, that way,
the mob won't hit me sparking my pet into action? Would this work, or will
each time choke hits the mob for damage root will break much like the rain
for the Wizard would break root.

Many thanks in advance ..

Stevie.
