If I stand for a while and just cast spells, all works properly, however, if
I am sitting and stand up to cast a spell, the spell "lags".. it doesnt seem
to start casting until the little spell timer gauge is a few bubbles
through. Sometimes its really bad and the timer window will finish
completely before the spell starts casting. I also notice that when I stand
up to cast spells, my lag meter often jumps up over 1000 ms.

As I say, no problems if I dont sit. My ping meter will sit at a steady 200
ms (im in .au). If I ping patch.everquest.com, the connection looks perfect.
No packet loss and very consistent pings.
Another thing... ive only had this problem since getting cable. i was on a
56k dial up.
Ive tried adjusting datarate.txt high and low, and adjusting my default tcp
receive window, but neither of these make any difference.

My ping meters left hand side develops these gaps for a second or two, then
fills up. It appears as if my pc is delaying incoming or outgoing data, so
its happening in chunks, rather than a smooth flow.

If anyone has any ideas Id love to hear them.
