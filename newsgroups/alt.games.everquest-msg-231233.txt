Nah, because at some point you have to exchange it via paypal or
something yourself. Meanwhile, it may have lost cash value over time.
This method would be too risky in ways you have not considered. SOE
can get wind of it and delete the plat at any time,  the value can
drop too much, etc. Its just not a good place to "hold" money.

Ah, yeah same here. I don't think it will ever be that way either
since as you say its just not stable. They will stick to what they
know, real cash and investments.
