Amen!  It makes you wonder if the programming required for archery is simply
too complex to be properly implemented.

In my youth I played Asheron's Call (AC1?) and archery was also horrible.
In the case of AC, though, the problem was reversed.  Archery was better -- 
much better -- than melee.  In AC everyone wanted to be an archer.  Poor AI
and poor level design opened the way for any number of archery exploits.

I don't think any of us want that.  But a happy medium would sure be nice.
