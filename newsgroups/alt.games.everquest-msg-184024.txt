Checked out eqtraders.com for info on this.  Gonna cost about 30pp for 
each one, and you need decent pottery skill and decent brewing or 
alchemy skill to make one.  Be prepared to lose quite a few if you don't 
have good skill on them, I'm at triv on the brewing portion and only 
made 6 out of 20, ouch.  Guess I'll work on brewing before I make more. 
  If you want to buy them, I've seen them starting at 40pp, those people 
aren't making much on each, more usual is around 50 or 60pp
