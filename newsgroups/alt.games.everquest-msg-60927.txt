Yeah, easy to avoid abuse: Make xp level-relative:
No matter at WHAT level you donate any give item to your god,
you will always get the same amount of - lets say - percent
of a blue bub for your current level:

Who would try to exploit this, if you got like 1 blue bub for
each armor piece of ro?
BUT - in a hell level, when you finally found better amor,
you might be tempted to turn in your complete armour of ro for
about 1.5 - 2 yellers...

some dagger of marnek - quarter of a blue bub,
a shadowbound robe - half a blue,
golden efreeti boots - 1.5 blues,

something along those lines....

The experience has to be visible, but not exploitable.

Or maybe - to prevent high levels from buying up large
stocks of lowbie items to gather xp - if you donate a ridiculously
low value item for your level, you will not get xp, but lose faction
with your gods main faction, for offending your god with
such a miserable offer of your loyalty

Should be doable.
Plus, since I only see positive responses here - why isn't
Verant working on that yet? Someone please forward
this thread to the responsible staff :)
