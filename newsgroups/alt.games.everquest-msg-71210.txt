Forest Loops, then Gold Black-Sapphire once you've gotten over 200 wis

Velium Fire-Opal or Velium Jade when you have WIS to spare

Are these stats right?  I don't think so.  Its a good choice regardless.

> Platinum Ruby Veil 7STR 7 WIS
I would seriously think about something with AC.  I saw a couple interesting
(and achievable at your level) options pop up on allakhazam over the last week.

This is crap.  Got one and destroyed it a few minutes later.  Runed Circlet
or Nightshade Wreath.  Alternately think about Imbued Enchanted Dwarf Plate
or get yerself to hate and hope for an EM Helmet.

These are both good

> Platinum armband 3STR 3WIS
Something with AC.  I wouldn't care if it has wis or not.

> Polished bone bracer 2AC 3WIS 3INT
Another Bracer of the Reverent at minimum.

> Adamite Epaulets 9AC 7WIS
> Chestplate of the Constant 20AC 8STA 5SvMagic
These are both fine, though there are a number of options for chestplate.
EBCP or something.

> Mammoth Hide Cloak 7AC 4WIS 5SvCold
Good, but Studded Acrylla is 7AC, 10WIS and some other stuff.  Will be pricey
though (probably 4k minimum) unless you make it yourself, as its the best
piece of Acrylla leather.  If you've got a good tailor skill, the zones you
have to hunt for materials would be ones that you'd actually get XP in.

> Fine Steel Girdle 9AC
Cenobite Belt from FM rare cycle?

> Gatorscale leggings 7AC 4WIS 15 HP
> Boots of the Reliant 11AC 6SvDisease
Boots for a cleric have always been a big puzzle.  GEBs or Imbued Enchanted
Dwarf Plate.  You'll probably have to spend about the same amount if you're
buying them, I'd rather have the dwarf plate.

> Springwood Club 5WIS 5STR 5INT (who cares what the dam/del ratio is- I'm
> not fighting anyway)
Do Paw of Oppolla quest, 9ac, 9wis and some other stats.

> Testament of Vanear 10WIS 10 Mana
Charred Guardian Shield will only lose you 1 wis and get you 10ac.

> Small Wisdom Diety 2WIS
The 3wis 3ac and saves seal that you get for doing the baking part of third
shawl quest.
