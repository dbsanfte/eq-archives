The safe spot is usually around (0,0) for the zone.  Whether that is
actually safe or not depends on the zone.

The way to get Verant to fix these bugs is to find a way to use them.
They fix holes fast when people find one accross the zone from the safe
spot, and start using it as a quick port across the zone. :-)
