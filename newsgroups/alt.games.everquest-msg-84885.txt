You will not evade me, "WBrownlee" <xenochryst@worldnet.att.net>:

Newsflash, honey... you ARE rather temperamental, whether it's a
matter of swooning over Legolas and exuding utter cheerfulness in
posts where you're happy, or going ballistic over a guardkiller and
over this question. (It takes one to know one; I just tend to hide it
better from places like usenet.)

Honestly, I have no idea what you expected to get from this thread.
You've been given the answer several times in multiple fashions and
all you do is scream (yes, scream) that you're being attacked for
asking and that nobody is answering you.

If you're being attacked for anything, it's for the screaming, not for
asking in the first place.
