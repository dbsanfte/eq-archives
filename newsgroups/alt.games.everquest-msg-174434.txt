A couple of you guys told me about buying the gold edition which had
all the expansions combined into one. I just got a message from a
local company here who have told me that the gold edition does -not-
include POP:

>the EQ gold we have from the OZ distributors Ubi_Soft does not have Planes of Power

>If you have any other question or require more information please let me know.  

>Thanks for asking us at Games Warehouse.

It's ridiculous that I cannot just buy one package to play this game.
I'm not bloody made of money and I will not spend a bloody fortune
buying 3 or 4 software packages to play a game that I would also need
to pay $30 AUS a month to play.

Who the hell is running this game ? I've been playing UO since it
started and every time a new expansion comes out if you buy the game
it includes -everything- for a single cheap as dirt purchase. $10 I
paid for the last expansion.

I've really been enjoying EQ but i'm not going to be ripped off. Gees
do they think we are all bloody millionaires ?

Not happy.
