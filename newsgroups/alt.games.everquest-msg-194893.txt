I think we're at 4 50+ shaman, now and 2 can be counted on to be there, I 
think.  There's a druid in my guild that is always assigned to me and never 
lets me die.  He's amazing.  We'll probably have 3-4 Clerics on the trip, 
so that will free up Shamen to slow.

At raid launch, we'll probably have a 57 ENC and a 53 ENC ( that's the way 
it's looking, now ).  The first time I did Chardok, I was about level 47 or 
49 and resists were very very rare for me in King room.  I have no idea 
why, since they were all red, but the other chanters I talked to before and 
after all agreed the resists were abnormally low in there.  No complaints.

We'll do him twice, I think.  If enough people want to stay for a 3rd, we 
can do it, but I don't think people will if we end up having to fight our 
way in.

Our last raid had 2 wipes there.  I don't remember what the first one was 
caused from, but I think the second one was because of a Sarnak falling in 
the pit coming from the room east of the Library and then training the 
Overking's room on us.  Maybe TH remembers more vividly, it was his Clicky 
raid =)

We'll have at least 8 people there that can Pacify.  I'm may suggest we 
pacify the room ( rogue / bindsight / pacify or wake ) and single King to 
the hall.  This strat has worked for people before, and if everyone does 
their job, it can work for us.  It requires more luck than the brute force 
method.  I'll decide when we get there, depending on how the raid is going.  
I don't like doing anything that could potentially aggro the Queen room =)

Thanks for the input here and on your other post.
