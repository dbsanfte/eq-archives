My level 5 Druid went from using a Cracked Staff to using a Velium
Warhammer. Missed a chance at a Coldain Velium Scimitar.....(the ONLY
Coldain Velium weapon I've EVER seen for sale anywhere, but the vendor was
afk and I was 10pp short; would've offered some spiderling silks to make up
the difference if they hadn't been afk)

If you have SoL, go to the Bazaar and see what you can find. You might be
able to find a scimitar or other Druid-usable 1hs weapon cheap.

If you don't have SoL.....find someone you trust that does and have them
check out the situation for you, or make a trip to Freeport. I don't
remember the shop (maybe Groflah's Forge in North Freeport), but there's one
there that has scimitars at a reasonable price. Granted, they're
non-magical, but still nice to use to get your skill up.
