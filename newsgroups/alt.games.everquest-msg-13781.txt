And who would you respect as a citing authority? FBI? Not going to investigate.
Local Police? Not going to investigate. Verant? Not going to investigate. 

In short, the only 'authorities' on these issues aren't going to investigate.

And when someone does report that no one knew or could have known their
password, you and others scoff and say, "they probably gave it away."

Can you read? I've know people to steal accounts so they could just send prank
e-mail.

Stolen credit cards get investigated by law enforcement. Stolen EQ, UO, and AC
accounts do not. There is zero risk by stealing one of these. In terms of risks
vs rewards, that makes this a lot more profitable.

"Stupidity is the most common element in the 
Universe, and one of the most destructive.
Fortunately, it tends to form a solid bond with
laziness, which is the second most common.
Without the abundance of laziness in the universe,
we might all be dead."
