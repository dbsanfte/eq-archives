While this is logical, and top posting is hard to get used to for 
someone used to the reverse, its still not the worst posting system.

I reserve that for a newsgroup with no conventions at all; top and 
bottom posting mixed... if I join a newsgroup where everyone top posts, 
I'm not going to start bottom posting just because I feel its better; 
I'll top post too.

If top posting is driving on the left, and bottom posting is driving on 
the right, then what is mixed posting?  Collisions!

Hmm, a better analogy might be the English and Metric systems.  Clearly 
the metric system is superior, but if you are in a country that uses the 
English system, you need to use that or be very clear that you are being 
contrary.  Since the USA lost a very expensive spacecraft due to mixed 
measuring systems, I think that lesson is pretty clear.

ps; ever read Dhalgren?  Fun... but I wouldn't want to read every book 
that way.
