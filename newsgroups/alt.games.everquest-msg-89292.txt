Sounds like you have better gear than I did at your level.  I did not head
to EC to do some shopping until level 35.  At that level I was in Rathe Mtns
(still am) and finally making money.  So don't get too discouraged.  You're
geared fine for your level.  Definitely do the Testament of Vanear quest as
the others mentioned.  It can be done at level 17 and is a great item to
have.
