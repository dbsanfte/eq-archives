A level 51 druid friend of mine just learned that same lesson last night. :)

Ok, here's the deal.

On the Old World (original 3 continents) you're NOT KOS in most places.  The
only places I know you're KOS are Everfrost (and Halas, I assume), and
Nektulos/Neriak.

In Oggok you're dubious or better (perhaps apprehensive) to the merchant
right at the zone...I think you're KOS to any evil guard in any evil town.

Kunark and Velious?  Wolf form is less than useful...seems you're KOS pretty
much everywhere you're normally safe without wolf form.

Unrest...feel free to wander around that zone all you want.  You'll be
indifferent to everybody.  That DOES NOT mean you make a great puller...hit
a critter and the one next to it will join it.  It does make you a good
scout though and PERHAPS a good puller (that just depends on your skill).
