Read my original comment again, Kaev.  I never said, or even implied,
those two things are the same.  I said what I meant, and I meant what
I said, and I still stand by it.  If you're still subscribing, you've
given SOE a loud and clear message that the bugs are acceptable.

Sorry, but I can only give your troll 1 out of 10.  Next time, try to
be less obvious when you put words into the mouths of other people.
The troll will come off better.

: Looks to me like your logic has worse flaws than the latest patch cycle.

Looks to me like you're not applying any logic at all.
