I've been away fighting in Kunark, mainly Sarnaks and Giants for many
levels. However today I returned to my home town of Qeynos to assist a
friend. We were wandering thru the streets near the Priest of Discord, when
'Lieutenant Dargark' or similar aggroed me!! i took 780 damage from his
first spell and 280 from his second before I zoned with 156 to spare. My
faction with the Qeynos guards is impeccable (ally), so why did I get
attacked by random?! I checked the text log to see if I had maybe
accidentally attacked him but I hadn't. I just got called an infidel and
nuked!!
