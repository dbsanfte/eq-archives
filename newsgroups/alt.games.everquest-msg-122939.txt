The reason I originally took up tradeskills at all was so that I could make
cool armor for myself.  The reason I continue with tradeskills is in part to
be able to complete the shawl quests, and in part to be able to make some
cool stuff.  I will not be likely to be making any of the real high end
cultural stuff soon, as it is way too expensive to get the components.  What
I will be able to do is provide my guild with someone who can do the
combines to create some of these items.  I do find levelling the tradeskills
mind numbing at times, but I do enjoy actually achieving some goal with
them.
