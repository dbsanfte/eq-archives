I almost never use DoTs in LDoN, if we aren't killing fast enough for the 
DoT to be inefficient, then we are likely not succeeding anyway.  I buff, I 
slow, I heal at times, and I use my crappy DD and not so crappy rain 
spells.  DoTs I will use on a boss mob if I have a good agro holder tanking 
it.
