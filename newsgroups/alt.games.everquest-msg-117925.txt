I kinda like the hammer.  It sucks compared with every other pet in the
game, but it's not 100% useless.  When you need to kill a lot of greens
(questing, trade skills...) without going OOM, the pet is the way to do
it: it can't tank, but a cleric can, and mobs will always try to hit
you in preference to the pet when you're in range.
