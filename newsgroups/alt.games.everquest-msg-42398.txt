Hi, I had problems last year due to phone line noise. Have you tried 
taking your computer to a friends or relations house and trying to 
connect ?
  Presume you have run a trace route to the server to identify at what 
point you get packet loss. Perhaps one of the routers is being 
overloaded and does not have enough bandwidth.
Try  running the trace route using the different ISP's.
Lag and packet loss problems can be difficult to track down, but you 
have to  eliminate your computer and local phone lines first.
Good luck
Kevin
