Quite rightly, because of what you have done to
the victim. Not only have you robbed him, you have
also made a deliberate selection because of his
race.

It is not "more" punishable, it is in addition to
the greed motive.

Yes, it would be.

How can the method be the same, when he picks one
because of her race?

You are confusing justice with the law.

I am sure she would, but this is not just about
the victim, it is also about the criminal, and the
crimes he has committed. 

And, given your earlier statement, that you have
nothing against sentencing guidelines that take
into account racial hatred, presumably you
wouldn't mind if he got the extra years for the
racially motivated crime, as long as their was no
specific law to convict him.

She might tell you to shove it, too.
