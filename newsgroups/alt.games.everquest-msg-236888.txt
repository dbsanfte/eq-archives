	I would ask them why their god chose to answer their probably small and
petty request while ignoring, say, the pleas of a mother in some war-torn
nation whose daughter was moments away from being gang-raped.

	Mu.  I have no prayers.

	Old story, probably false but I like it anyway :-) :  the French
astronomer Laplace wrote a great treatise on astronomy, and Napoleon called
him to the imperial court to be praised for it.  When Lapace was presented,
Napoleon said "I have read your work, and it is excellent, but I see no
mention in it of the Almighty."  Laplace said "sire, I had no need of that
hypothesis".

	We don't need gods to explain the universe any more.

|it... I'd be skeptical that you would believe for a talking fish.

	How about changing the gravitational constant of the universe for a start?
