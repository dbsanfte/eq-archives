Try as I might, I see no incentive for Verant.
Only for you.

And, even if it were incentive, how would Verant
benefit from such a display?

Perhaps you could try and get the law changed, so
that EULA-breakers could be forced to wear a
placard stating "I have no honour.... I broke my
EULA". Being a decorated war-hero would,
obviously, be no exemption.
