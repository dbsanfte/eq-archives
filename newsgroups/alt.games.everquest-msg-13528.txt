According to Verant, they themselves woke up the sleeper accidently. Maybe
by GM-killing the last warder or something.

However, THE SLEEPER IS SUPPOSED TO KILL EVERYTHING IN THE ZONE. That is
part of what he does. What I read is that when FoH woke him up, like 30
red-to-a-60 crystal golems spawned and immediately started attacking the
sleeper, who proceeded to wipe them all out without taking any measurable
damage on his hp bar.

The whole plotline is that the dragons want him asleep...he wants to get
payback against his tormentors, so he proceeds to kill every living thing
in the zone, be it PC or NPC.
