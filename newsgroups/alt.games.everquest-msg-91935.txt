Very true, if I'm not doing anything, I happily rez those who
need. Unless I'm about to log; sorry, but I'll not extend my
playtime for strangers. Hell, if I see a corpse with just a
couple minutes gone from its rez timer, I'll shoot a tell to
the owner, asking if he needs a rez. Why not? Will save that
guy some time, and I'm not using my mana for anything else...

No flames from this cleric. If I get cash for a rez, that cash
is split evenly with my group. They have to wait, too, so it's
only fair. My mana is my group's, not mine alone. And I always
ask the group first, to make sure they're Ok with me rezzing
outsiders.

If I'm ungrouped and not busy, I could care less whether I'm
paid or not. If I rez you while I'm busy and you're not in my
group and/or guild, and you don't offer me at least a token
payment? You'll have to look elsewhere for the next rez. All
that said, I never ask for payment up front. But I don't get
why asking for payment gets to you, the time the cleric gives
you is his own, and if he wants to put a pricetag on his time,
why shouldn't he be allowed that?

Rune, has no blacklist, so probably rezzed people who he swore
he would never rez again anyway, heh
