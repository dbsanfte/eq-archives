}>It only works with 'soulbound' keys.
}It's not that simple.  For example, the Tower of Frozen
}Shadow keys are not soulbound, but they go onto the
}keyring as well.

Went to ToFS last night, with one character with 2nd floor key, and one 
without.  clicked on the mirror, both went up.  deleted the key, ran 
around to the front again, clicked and both went up.  So it still takes 
your group, even if it's only on your keyring.

Then went to befallen and najena, and can confirm that the first befallen 
key and all najena keys cannot be added to your keyring.  Bother. :)
