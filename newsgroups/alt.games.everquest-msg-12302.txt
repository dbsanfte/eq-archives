PD is the archetypical wannabe uber guild. They're quite willing to
shit all over everyone when they want something. KSing, training, no
tactic is too low for them. Once they've pharmed what they want, they
whine that they're not given proper respect because they quit KSing
and training people in that zone, but people still remember it for
some reason. 

They're kind of a third rate FoH in that regard. At least when FoH
were training people in the planes they were the first to do so.
