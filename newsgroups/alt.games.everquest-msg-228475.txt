Here's how it was explained to me.  The buff icon lasts 48 seconds, 
however, once it wears off, the mob only slowly regains its "hearing"; 
every 48 seconds it gains another chunk, so that it takes 5 minutes to 
work all the way back up to its fully unlulled state from something that 
reduced its aggro radius to zero.

Apparantly there was somethign to do with AA, where one designed to make 
effects last longer was actually making pacification last longer but 
work correctly, so it would last a minute and then the mob would snap to 
full aggro radius, where someone without the AA casting the same spell 
on the same mob would experience a working duration of 5 minutes!  This 
is where I first heard about this odditiy; they announced that they were 
fixing this problem.  To me it seemed that they were re-breaking it, 
restoring its bugged condition to the people with the AA, instead of 
fixing it by making the effect last only 48 seconds as you might expect 
for people without the AA... but thats not the direction they went.

This means to me that "fixing" bard lull to 18 seconds (which of course 
should be its duration, as with almost all things bardly) is a direct 
reversal of their fix to AA enhanced Lull line!

To be fair, bard lull should last 18 seconds, then decay as normal lull 
but at 18 second intervals, so it would last 1.875 minutes (assuming the 
5 minute thing is literally correct, which is unlikely)

At any rate, to test this idea, what you'd want to do is find a mob and 
locate its max aggro range, then lull it, step just inside that range, 
and wait, see how long it takes.  Use a variety of lulls, in theory, the 
low level one that barely reduces aggro range at all will wear off 
quickly, but the higher level ones will last longer and longer.

Then, use the lowest level lull, and find the point at which the mob 
will aggro anyway.  Use a higher level lull, move in to that "anyway" 
point, and see if the mob aggros on you sooner than it did when you used 
the same lull but sat out at the max aggro range on him with no lull on 
at all.
