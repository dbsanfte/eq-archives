LOL, as a monk, I assume you to most of the pulling?
For a mere 3 points you can get latent jboots (run speed 3). Never wears
off, never gets dispelled, doesn't take a buff slot, and works
irrespective of indoor/outdoor zones. That AA skill alone will keep you
steps ahead of most mobs in the game, meaning you don't get hit running
mobs back to camp. Saving many many deaths for you, and much healing for
the group. Another 3 points and you can get 3hp per tick extra regen -
useful while you're FD waiting for mobs to split. Another 12 points for
another 3 hps per tick.
