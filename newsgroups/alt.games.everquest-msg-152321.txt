Havent noticed any tradeskill failures due to lag (and with 224 
tailoring and owning 8th shawl, i should have seen some indication of 
the problem)
There was/were 1 tradeskill problem that were either lag caused or a 
bug. If you used/use (havent tried in a while, got tired of the problem, 
so not sure if its still there) the forge at horse vendors in bazaar and 
were using Acrylia + Chisel to make the acrylia smaller, i 2 times went 
LD, either to lag or bug, RIGHT after pressing combine and getting 
success message.
When i logged back, both times both chisel and result were gone. Not in 
inventory, not in forge, not in hand. One of the times i even had a 
guildie sitting waiting on me to finish, so i know noone got near the 
forge before i got back, so items werent taken from there by someone else.
