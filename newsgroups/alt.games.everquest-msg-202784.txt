Anybody know of a list of minimum levels to receive buffs in the wake of the
patch? Not just KEI, but the mgb spells of various classes, the beastlord
spirit line of mana/hp group regen buffs, etc.?

Or is it now simply related to the spell's level maybe -- so for instance if
KEI won't stick on anyone below 45, does that mean that Spiritual Light
(lvl44 bst spell) won't stick on anyone below 29?
