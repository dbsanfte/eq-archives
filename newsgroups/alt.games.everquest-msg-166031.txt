If that's his reasoning, an apology on that point may be in order. However,
I don't quite think that was his point - it's not really like Bizbee to post
anything like that. Although now he'll post that it was simply to spite me.

About the bots, I know how bots get addresses, but it's honestly not that
hard to delete the little spam I get. Of course, I wouldn't miss the chance
to kill a spammer and wear his/her rib cage like a vest...

Besides, a little porn email never hurt anyone! Well, unless you get that
weird porn spam...
