I got the LOY expansion pretty much to use the LFG tool, as well as the 
mapping side. The maps are fine but as of yet I have not found any 
players through the LFG tool. Even though the tool looks good and seems 
the perfect answer for players looking for group. Maybe i'm the only one 
:(

Is it because i'm still to low. I'm a level 15 shammy, still don't 
understand why people at lower levels don't use it? Or do they not know 
how it works?
