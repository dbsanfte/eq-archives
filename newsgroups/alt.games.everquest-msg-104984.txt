    There it is. In my experiences Indifferent or better is required.

    Some start other than Indifferent, and some get that way from killing
Sol Ro mobs. Some get that way from hailing the efreeti in the back of the
temple once (hailing him lowers Temple faction a full notch).

    Try and get the quest from the NPC using the keyphrases beforehand. If
he'll give it to you, you can do the quest. Or /con a NPC - if you're lower
than Indifferent you might want to do some faction work beforehand.

    There's a wizard NPC behind Ortallius in SRo. For every 2 pp? you hand
him he gives you a random spell scroll (level 16ish, bias to wizard nukes)
and Temple of Sol Ro faction. Can pump faction here very quickly given the
coin.
