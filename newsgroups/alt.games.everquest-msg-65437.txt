The best way is to take your keyboard apart and put tape between the 
connectors so that it can never work.

Unless you actually use that key outside of EQ, then go with the software 
solution.  Look on Winfiles.com, tucows.com, or the such for a fix.  You 
can also do a search in this NG on Google.com to find many threads on this 
which have links to the software you are asking about.
