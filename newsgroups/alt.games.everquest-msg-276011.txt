I like the premise, but vampires are just fun no matter what :P  You
are correct though, at $4.95 it is pretty cheap.  If the adventures are
linked like they claim, it could really be a blast.  As for WoW, a few
of my friends (RL friends) that left for WoW when it first came out
started trickling back into EQ2.  So far the complaints I heard were
that it was pretty fun, but also really shallow.  If EQ2 does a good
job with this adventure pack as the first one, it might win back more
of the people that it lost.

I didn't see the level limits like one of the previous posters
mentioned.  Although, with level 45 as the top end, I don't think it
will gray out until you hit 50.  I'm 47 currently, but a lot of my
friends are the high 30s, low 40s, so I should still be able to
contribute in there (and not gray everything out).  My brother just hit
25 and he is excited and pre-ordered also, so I'm not sure how much the
level limits are going to hurt the sales.  I do wonder if these are
going to be a time-limited offering or a forever deal.  I haven't seen
any word either way on that.
