Eh, Win2K was originally going to be where XP is now, but MS chickened out and
released the pile of refuse called ME (due to a few outstanding compatibility
issues, I believe).  The only time things break are due to drivers or the game
itself being written poorly, Win2K itself supports everything it needs to.

Anyway, I actually fixed my problems with the latest Detonator drivers... not
sure what did it.  I did two things at once: switched my AGP port to 2x in the
BIOS, and uninstalled my sound card and moved it to a different slot.  (I have
a piece of junk PCI64, but it works well when it's happy, but its drivers are
flaky and don't deal with Win2K's PCI steering all that well.)  But now
everything is happy in Win2K land again, with better performance than ever.

Return to Wolfenstein works well too :)  (That stupid game kept me from
playing EQ last night, heheh).
