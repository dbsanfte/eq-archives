I have only been asked if I am really a female once, and only
indirectly. I was invited to a group, one of the warriors seemed to
take a liking to my character's appearance or something and decided to
ask me to marry him immediately after I'd joined. One of the other
group members hoped I was a woman :) This was followed by the warrior
chain kneeling to propose, something he did for quite a while every
time he saw me.

I've found proposals to be much more common than the 'real gender'
question. I've had guys offer me engagement/wedding rings twice, and a
friend keeps suggesting I ask him to marry me as a joke (so that  I
can get his cool last name) However, my friends usually figure out
pretty fast what I am and don't have to ask :)
