They can't stop you from saying something like 'pussy', but the
profanity filter is there for those who don't want to hear it.
Your right to free speech stops at the other guy's ears; they have 
a right to choose not to hear it, and Blizzard has the right
to choose not to carry it. 

In this case, you intentionally bypassed the profanity filter,
by encoding the word using other glyphs. I'm surprised that the
other person chose to petition, but they did and Blizzard backed
them up.  If you don't like the way Blizzard handled this, then you
can stop giving them money. It sounds like you've done that, so huzzah.
Bully for you!
