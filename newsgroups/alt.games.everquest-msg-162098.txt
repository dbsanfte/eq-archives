Most definitely.

At a skill of 117 in tailoring, I did two quick combines, got Shawl 5, then
Shawl 6, both on my first attempt, even got a skillup on the 6th shawl
combine.  I then proceeded to make myself an Arctic Wyvern cloak, at
tailoring 118.  I did fail the two attempts at an Arctic Wyvern Tunic
though.

Oh, Also got my Blessed Fishing Pole on my first attempt with a skill of 165
in Fishing.

To make up for it, I had a GM smith attempt my sickle combines for me, all
three attempts failed.  Prior to that, I had a 218 smith try twice as well,
and fail them.

Sometimes you get amazingly lucky, sometimes you get amazingly unlucky.
