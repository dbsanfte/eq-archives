Better yet

for wis under 200 every 5pts = your level in mana.
wis over 200 = 5.6mana per point.

This just came up today - cleric had a shoulder
with +2 wis on it, and the shoulder dropped off
the princess on Island 1 in PoA - with 50 mana
on them (among other things).

Cleric is level 50, so if he has <= 200 wis,
the 2 wis is only 20 mana - the new shoulders
are better in that regard (and many others).

He actually has 220ish wis, so the 2 wis was
about 12 mana, so the new shoulders were an
even better deal.
