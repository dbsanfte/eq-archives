You're nuts...  but bolts used to have all those problems (all the same
problems as arrows for the most part).  DX9 changed things, many for the
worse, a few for the better.  You can still miss with a bolt and hit
something else, but as far as I can tell it will happen *only* if the mob
dies after a bolt is cast but before it connects.  Arrows and bolts are much
safer to use in crowds these days.
