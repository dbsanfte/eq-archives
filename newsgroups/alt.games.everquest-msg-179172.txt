Well... You could stop feeding it, or perhaps administer it a deadly 
poison, drown it, choke it, or beat it with a blunt instrument until it 
shuffles off its mortal coil.

Seriously now... If you are talking about the new armor dyes that come 
with LoY, I'm afraid you are out of luck. They basically let you overlay 
a tint over the existing texture, so if the robe is plain, solid black, 
nothing you add over that will show up. If you had a Flowing Black Robe, 
which is black with some highlights and detailing, then the dye will 
show up over those, not over the black.
