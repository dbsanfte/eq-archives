: fixing the under-level buff exploit.

	Once upon a time (before Velious) four of my friends and I jumped
	(back) into EQ and all started new chars.  We had fun and pain for
	about six months or so, some more some less, none of us getting to
	any 'uber' levels.  For myself I played a DE Necro to lvl 22.  I
	loved my necro...until lvl 20, at which point my new Allure spell
	basically made my char almost completely un-fun.

	Knowing far more about the game at this point I knew what I really
	wanted was to be an Iksar necro, but the thought of starting over
	and putting the relatively huge amount of work required to get an
	Iksar upto 20 at the time.  I couldn't even hand down my l33t raw
	silk armor I had made myself.  I quit EQ.  Pretty much all my
	friends did as well save for one who went nutty playing three comps
	at once (still does to this day).

	Fast forward about a year.  Luclin came out in the interm and PoP
	just came out.  I decide all games suck and I'll try again to get my
	Iksar necro.  Finding both KEI and Palvadol(sp?) Caverns I managed
	to get my "replacement" necro upto the levels of my original
	casually in a matter of a couple weeks (took me the better part of
	six months the first time).

	PC insane exp stops at lvl 25, but that's fine.  EQ really isn't EQ
	until about lvl 20 or so.  Yes, I know there are still other major
	shifts later, but 20-30 for most classes is when they really "come
	into their own" and can actually be played.

	I now 2box a 35 monk and 31 necro, I never pickup KEI or whatever
	and I don't feel a loss by it.  My point however, is that having
	done the "low level raw start" once I'm glad I did it...but I'd
	never do it again.  If KEI and similar and the major exp in PC were
	removed, I'd never start another char in EQ.  If I felt the need to
	try another class I'd honestly buy an account in such a case over
	going through newbie life again.

	I tried to start a new char on the non-transfer server...  Got to
	level 5 cleric after a week.  The only thing it did is make me
	wonder how I ever got my first non-twink necro to 22.  I guess I was
	younger then and valued my time less.
