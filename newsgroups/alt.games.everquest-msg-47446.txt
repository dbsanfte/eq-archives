Did a lot of reasearch yesterday from just about anywhere that would talk
about quad-kiting.  Got home from work last night and decided to try my hand
at quad'n some Tizmaks or snow cougars.

The first run was pretty scary btw, I had only intended on pulling one Tizzy
to see how mana would fair simply lightning striking the thing to death, but
in a burst of courage, I pulled the first one off a way, ran back and laid a
snare on the 2nd one.  Level 35 dru btw - so I'm not fresh into the
Lightning Strike, but never used it during 34 when I first got it.
Anyway...what a rush!  Once I got the hang for packing the mobs into a
little cluster, it was almost too easy.

I never did a quad during the evening but did do 3 tiz's at once on a couple
of occasions.  Kinda funny too, several folks wandering past from the ring
in GD would stop and watch - maybe trying to figure out if it was just a
glitch or if I really DID have a little litter of Tizmaks chasing me.

For the experienced quadders amongst you, does quad/multi-kiting even out -
mana/downtime-wise for you?  I was burning through my full mana on most of
these - or close to it - but it seemed to me that with 3 or 4, this
techinique would really start to pay off.  As far as exp, I had just dinged
35 the night before, and finished a several hour play session last night
with almost a full yellow in this hell level - seemed pretty decent to me
since the single solo pulls of Tizzy's only made a little blue etching in
the exp bar - the couple I did solo ahead of time to see how the exp was.

Thanks in advance for any input.
