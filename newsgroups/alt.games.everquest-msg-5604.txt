Hi Darren.

First off, thanks for the non-condescending reply.  A little kindness goes a
long way.  Now, since I love a good debate, here's my reply to you.

True, anonymity is limited.  But for someone to actually take the time to
hunt down another for posting something they didn't like on a public video
game news forum is bordering on infancy.  It wouldn't be too difficult for
someone to mask their ISP while posting though (but that's really beside the
point).  I don't condone what Zeppo did.  I'm simply pointing out a
precedence where a TOC violation took place.  The exact same violation
occurred again with Matt Frisch, yet certain members of this community are
quick to overlook it because they know Frisch in one way or another.  If
consistency is to be maintained and these people wish to not be viewed as
hypocrites, they should report Frisch, as well.
