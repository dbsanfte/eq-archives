    No kidding. New players seem to get sucked in by it a lot.

    They didn't want invulnerable healers. Listen to the complaints about
cross-teaming from some Zeks to know what would result if buffs/heals could
cross from blues to reds. As for having the PvP option on a blue server....
well, they have PvP servers now, and they know how few people want PvP. I
have to agree with you - nuke the PoD.
