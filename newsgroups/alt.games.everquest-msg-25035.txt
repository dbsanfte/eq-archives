After some experimentation, I've determined that the keyboard stays active
after I've accidentally minimized EQ. I've been fortunate in that it's only
happened
in places where it's safe for me to camp.

I just click on the EQ button on the task bar. You can tell when EQ has control
because the mouse pointer disappears. I then hit /sit followed by /camp, wait
for
the "choose a character" music, and kill it from the Task Manager. It hasn't
happened
in a long time. I would probably use "/camp desktop" now that I know about that
command.

If you're a decent typist and you minized during a battle or other awkward
situation, you could at least type your predicament to your group members so
they'd know what's going on. Conceivably, you could even cast spells or use
abilities via the /cast and /doability commands until the battle was over and
camp out afterward.

It might be an interesting experience  playing blind and deaf but I
don't intend to try it anytime soon. :-)
