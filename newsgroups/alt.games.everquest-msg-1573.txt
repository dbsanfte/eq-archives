I made tons o' dough with my Druid at the giant fort in FM. They drop an avg
of 2pp each and regularly have axes, swords, picks, tunics, gold medallions,
pearl earrings etc. which sell between 11pp and 65pp to merchants.

At 31 I grouped, then at 34 I partnered with a cleric. We would ping-pong
until we couldn't carry anymore, then I would TP to a Druid Ring to sell (NK
gave me the best prices), then return for more mayhem.

Of course being a Druid there is almost nothing worth having that I can
afford that I can't get myself. Runed Mithril Bracers are nice though.
