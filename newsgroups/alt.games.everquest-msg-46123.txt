We have *NEVER* gotten a class specific stuff from those $%#@%$@
Defenders.

If they actually had a chance of loading something like a ring of
superiority, it would be worth the hassle of killing them.  But chain
flurrying, double 700 per pop drakes that load crap just plain annoys
the hell outta me.  Sometimes we lose more to these drakes than we do
to some of the dragons in that zone.

Aside for the ranger only bow, almost every class specific stuff is
decent.  The Ring of Superiority is nice as well.

And even the ranger bow is nice for twinkies...which reminds me, I
really should get my warrior twinkie over there as the next warrior
only necklace will rot.
