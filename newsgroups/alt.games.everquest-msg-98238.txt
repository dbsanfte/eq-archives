I dunno, jazz... I'm a Tunare Druid and I wouldn't miss rezes if Shammies
got them. Rallos Zek ONLY has Ogre Shammies as their priests... not even
Human Clerics can follow RZ (which is a pain in the ass if your looking for
Jade Imbues) :o)

If Pallies can cast Rezes, then Shammies should too, I guess... but NOT
Beastlords :o)
