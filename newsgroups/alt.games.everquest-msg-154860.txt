    Stormhammer name changes are free, once every four months... every four
months, once.... once in four months... think I said it enough?
    If you do create a Legends account and move your characters there, you
can have each of the characters names changed for no additional cost, every
four months. Why bother with all the create one with the same name crap?
Move them to Legends, arrange them the way you want to, cancel and move back
to yer regular server. Be aware, it can take up to a month and a half to
have them moved back after you cancel, even though the average is 3 weeks,
but moving them there only takes a few hours.
    You may find Legends alot more quiet and the gm's alot more amiable and
helpful, so if ya stay a while I won't hold it against you. I was there for
8 months myself.
