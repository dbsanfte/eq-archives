Oh, shush now!  Here you're trying to interject logic into MY rambling!!

;-)

The big deal in my case is that it's not just I, but most the buddies I
adventure with who will not be able to play EQ as it is for the next few
weeks/months.  If we want to keep adventuring together in the meantime, our
option is to move to a text MUD, or go for a lower end game, such as
Asheron's Call.

(or roleplay as a gang of LSD addicts.....)

As for UO?   ewwwwwwww.....

The big deal for Verant in this case is that if they lose customers to
another game, even for a month or two, the chances of gaining them back
diminish.

I was very involved in the previous game I played.  When that one became
unplayable for me, I "temporarily" switched to EQ.  I haven't been back
there since.  It's possible EQ may have just permanently lost many players
this week.... not because they pissed them off, but because they will not be
able to play until they upgrade.  In the mean time, they'll probably find
something else to play, and that increases the risk that they may never come
back.......
