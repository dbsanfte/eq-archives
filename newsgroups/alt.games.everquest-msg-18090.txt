You're forgetting just one little thing:  the law of supply and demand. 
Jewlery is a fairly difficult skill, and is hideously expensive to learn. 
(Especially for non-enchanters, since they have to sell all their
non-magical practice junk back at a loss.)  Therefore, there aren't a lot
of highly skilled enchanters running around.  Therefore, the ones that
*are* making high end items (Vellium and Platinum, rare gems and such) can
pretty much charge *WHATEVER THEY WANT.*  If you don't like paying 1,500 pp
for an earring that costs 300pp in materials, feel free to spend the 4000pp
on materials to get your Jewelry skill to the point where you can make your
own.  And good luck talking an Enchanter into enchanting the metal for you.
