After taking 6 months off I have started EQ back up.  The POP expansion is
what convinced me to come back.  The other night I was in Everfrost and saw
the wolves up there.  They looked like they had Tiger Stripes of orange and
black.  If this is a bug then any help in fixing would be welcomed.  If not
then I need to speak with those crazy Shamans and get them to turn the
wolves back to their warm, cuddly selves.
