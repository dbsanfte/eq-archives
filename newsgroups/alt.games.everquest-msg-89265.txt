The list keeper (group leader, usually) just keeps a list on paper
and calls for the person on top of the list when a spot opens up.
If they're honest that is, and don't shuffle the list to accomodate
friends or classes that he/she feels they need.

There's no reason to put up with this BS any more, IMHO. With all 
of the expansions, and especially with easy travel through the
Nexus, why should anyone sit and wait to get into an xp group?
Especially High Pass, which was always a zoo to begin with.
