I'd guess that 95+ % of wizards that solo post-50 or so have either Tboots
or Jboots (or a lot of sow potions), they also get a snare spell (which is a
bit less efficient than druid snare, because it's an aoe, then they just run
around and nuke, run around, nuke, run around, nuke, never being in melee
range, druid's can do the same thing, albeit with slightly less efficiency
due to less efficient spells.

This same technique can be easily adapted from killing 1 thing, to killing
up to 4 things, but this restricts potential targets also, since the nukes
that you can use to kill 1 thing are usually more efficient than the ones
that work on all 4 (and in the case of druids, the 4 target spells are
outdoors only), the key is to run around and 'group' all 4 targets up into a
tight bundle (while snared for druids, and prior to snare for wizards, since
it's easier to group them unsnared, and wizards get an aoe snare), then
start nuking and running.  (this is the basic of quad-kiting)
