And usenet is comparatively free, and the experience of a news reader
app is the difference between hotmail and and a real mail client... no
comparison really.

The real question is *why* do you have such a busy site if the primary
objective of this page is redundantly giving access to something
that's already free and readily accessible to the vast majority of
people that should have it. People at work where its blocked don't
count... they're already misappropriating resourcs...

This may not be true with the particular program you are affliated
with but normally you can specify that certain specific ads are
inappropriate on your site... be they competitors ads for example, or
ads that say offensive to your sites objective (breast milk
substitutes on a site dedicated to  'breast feeding is good for your
baby'  ... or... inducements to perform bannable offenses in the game
the site is dedicated to.

Googles terms are based on maxim 'don't be evil'... I'd be surprised
if they are forcing ads on you that you actively object to. I've
always found them a pleasure to deal with.
