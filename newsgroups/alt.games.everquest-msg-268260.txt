Perhaps thats Oakmyst.  They might have capped the fish at a reasonable
amount, I'm not sure since I don't really gather there.  The zone is too small
with too few spawn points for any serious gathering.

Pass through Forest ruins and Peat Bog though, you will see fish stacked 4
deep on top of each other, 12 or 15 fish spawn points in each little pool.
(Forest ruins especially, since there are two ponds.) and when all the fish
are up, you'll see a very, very limited number of metal / wood / stone /
trapping nodes spawning around the zone.

Personally, my theory of what is hapening is this.   Tradeskill nodes have a
designated spawn area, rather than specific spawn points.  Within each spawn
area, there can be X number of tradeskill nodes up, of any type.  If the node
is a fish, it is placed specificly in the water portion of the spawn area.  In
smaller zones like Forest ruins, the tradeskill spawn area can be as big as
the zone is, in bigger zones multiple areas are used.   Clearing a tradeskill
node of any type in the area will cause another to respawn in a few minutes in
the same general spawn area.

I haven't gathered much in Antonica, but I am venturing there now to gather.
Several things did strike me about the trip though.   All of the tradeskill
resources were in the center of the zone, and the waters were full of fish.
Typing it out there doesn't give a sense of the extremeness of what I
witnessed though.  You would walk along the coastline and the *entire* shore
would be absolutely covered in fish.   Stacked 4 deep.. the names so close
that moving your cursor 4 pixels will highlight 3 or 4 different nodes.
Then for about 3 screenlengths inside from the shore, absolutely zero
tradeskill nodes.   Then the center of the zone which was spawning every kind
of node (except fish, since no water) and respawning fairly fast.

One of these days I hope to catch a pristine antonica, right after the server
comes up, to see where the tradeskill nodes begin distributed.  If nodes begin
covering the whole land, but in the "respawn zones" which overlap the ocean,
eventually all the land ones get cleared and respawn in the ocean.  With the
center zone being the only one that can't go completely to fish because of no
water.  (Although it does go 75% to shrubs at times. :P)   Or possibly it
begins like that, and there are no spawning areas near the shore.  Which would
argue for a static number of fish spawn points.


It's all guessing at this point, but being EQ, and knowing how they did the
placeholder / spawn areas in EQ1... I don't think it's an unreasonable guess.
I haven't seen anything official on it first hand (since I don't read any
official forums) but all the second hand info I've heard is either
inconclusive or supports the "fish overcrowding" theory.  Not sure I trust the
sources who have said it though, so... if  you know of any dev posts on the
subject, please, please point me at them.
