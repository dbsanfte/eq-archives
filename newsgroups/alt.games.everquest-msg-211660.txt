Was the ranger using melee or bow?  Was he leaving before the mob
died to pull the next mob?  I find that my friend (65 ranger, EQ/
AM3, ~1700 atk) does superb sustained damage if he's not the puller
and using his bow, but if he's the puller he loses 35% of his potential
damage (in HoH he leaves when the mob is at 35% to pull the next).
If, for any reason, he can't use his bow then he has his DPS cut
nearly in half.
