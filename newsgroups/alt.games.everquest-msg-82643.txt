Half the wanted babies aren't nurtured with any diligence.  Maybe we should
kill those, too?  Or maybe we should insist that the woman live with the
concequences of her action, instead of making the most defenceless of humans
pay for her foolishness.  The fact that the baby's not wanted does not
justify killing it.

No, the fact is, I see the issue for what it is.  Of course, since my view
differs from yours, it's impossible that mine could be well reasoned, right?

Really?  I know alot of unwanted children who were raised in healthy
environments.  Seems like you're over generalizing.  Not everyone's prone to
criminal neglect.

Oh, well hey, if we're killing them for their own good, I'm all for that!
Sheesh!  How about we give them a chance to make it?  Or are you saying that
the possiblity of "sliding to the wrong end" is justification for killing
them?

So, we just kill them early on?  How about we insist both men and women not
go around killing children, and lock up the ones that can't live with that
concept?

You make a fetish of whether or not the child can survive on it's own.  How
about a patient on life support?  How about a kid on a dialasys machine?
How about the wounded soldier on the battlefield, awaiting treatment?  Would
they all die, were they not to recieve help?  If you're ever in an accident,
remind me to tell the paramedics not to worry about you, since you're not
"viable."  How does the fact that the child is dependant on the mother make
it not a human?

It is a moth at that stage of development.

If you're going to use rape as a global justification for abortion, then you
need to prove that it's a global cause for pregnancy.

> about the ones that are pregnant because their contraceptives failed and

This is the weakest argument yet.  So, the contraceptive failed?  That's too
bad.  You engaged in sex, the leading cause of pregnancy, of your own free
will.  You take the concequences if your protection was inadequate.  Let me
put it another way.  If some guy was to take out a gun, engage the safety,
and attempt to fire it into his head, relying on the safety to keep him
alive... would you pitty him if he killed himself?

> it endangers their health or their life? What about the ones that might

Health and life is pretty much considered an acceptable reason for abortion
by even the most ardent pro-lifers.  It comes down to a choice of which life
you save, which should not be the government's decision.

> be retarded and unable to care for the baby?

Put it up for adoption?  The waiting list for people wanting to adopt even
retarded children far exceeds the number of children available for adoption.

> Is there never a circumstance when an abortion is reasonable? Would you

Life of the mother.  Even in that, I recognize that we are taking a life.

Yes, I did.  I don't hold the child's sperm donor (I refuse to use the word
'father' to describe him) against the child, who happens to be my god-child.
Neither does the mother.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
