I have 3 wisdom casters around the same level, with 130, 163 and 175
wisdom.  They all do just fine.

As far as I know the speed at which you regain mana is determined by
your meditation skill, not your total mana.  (No doubt someone will
correct me if I'm wrong.)  So in a group that's constantly pulling you
don't have to worry about the total number much, as long as you have
enough mana to get through each fight.  In these normal situations your
140 should be more than enough.  

High wisdom means you can do more damage (or healing) in a short time,
and that you have longer down time for medding after that.  So it's
great for solo work and emergencies.
