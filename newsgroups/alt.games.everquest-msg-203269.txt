<<<<<<<Pulp - I understand your frustration, really I do, but several people
HAVE addressed your "pesky little problem" as you so quaintly put it. 
But here, let me state it, out loud in front of everyone:

1. KEI on low level characters means an increased chance that someone
with less skill will level too fast, without learning the basic
composition/role of his class.  This means more basically unskilled
players in dangerous zones, which increases the cahnce of undue risk
to players WITH skill.  Granted, a player with enough skill,
intelligence, and cunning will usually find a way to deal with the
problem anyway, but the point is that skilled players should not HAVE
to deal with it.  Note:  I am not saying that YOU are an unskilled
player - but we're not looking at just you here, but at a large group
of players who are, in general, unskilled and a danger to people in
the zones in which they play. For good examples, see Dreadlands,
Karnor's Castle, Plane of Nightmare, Bastion of Thunder...the problem
has extended itself all the way to Tier 2 planes, and now with the
opening of several planes to everyone of either level 55 or 62
depending on the zone, we can expect that it will extend into Tier 3
before long as well.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Unfortunately, I think that the point you make here doesn't really work because
all of the zones that you're talking about are zones that 46 and above will be
in.  The low levels getting KEI that everyone seems to keep referencing aren't
going to be in those zones and the people that are in those zones are still
going to have the ability to get KEI so taking it away from low levels doesn't
really accomplish anything in this argument.  And I'm sorry but you can change
the names of the zones and it does make a difference.  At least on my server,
there definitely isn't a shortage of places to play that aren't overrun by low
levels with KEI.  I can go to a multitude of low level zones and or dungeons
and see five or six people in the zone.  It's a huge world now.

<<<<<<<2.  The difference between 4 and 14 mana per tick is minor when one's
mana pool is considerable, but for a level 20 or lower caster, the
results are dramatic.  Who needs skill when you have KEI?  So, it
leads to the above problem on a grand scale.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Well I still have to disagree with you because I don't see the above as being a
problem.  All this skill talk and not knowing how to play your class is quite a
bit overrated in my opinion.  I don't find the game that difficult.  At times
I've found it to be very slow, but never too difficult.  

<<<<<<In conclusion, to answer your question, "how does it hurt anyone to
have me and my group with KEI?", the answer is that it probably does
not hurt anyone in your specific case (although I cannot say that this
point is definite, never having observed your playing skills). 
However, the complaints are not about you specifically, but about
anyone who has used KEI to level without increasing his skill level,
thus making many zones far more dangerous than they have to be.  The
discernible majority of players who have become newbies since the
advent of KEI lack skill, and several of the people who played before
KEI but could not level without it also lack skill.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

I at least thank you for recognizing the fact that it's entirely possible that
me and my group having KEI doesn't hurt anyone because that's the case. Me and
my group  have been fighting in Tower of Frozen shadows for the last week and
we haven't seen another soul while we were in there.  We weren't bothering
anyone.  Half the guys in my group want to quit now because they don't like how
slow the game can be without KEI and I don't blame them.  I just haven't seen
any of the problems that people describe.  Most of the complaints can be easily
solved by /ignore or just moving and aren't gonna be fixed by taking KEI out
anyway.  

<<<<<<Last thing:  this post has not been intended as an attack; merely an
explanation of why KEI on low level characters is a threat to game
integrity, as well as being a threat to the fun had by players who
actually ARE skilled from bothering to learn the basics of mana
management and class structure.>>>>>

I appreciate that you weren't attacking as I'm sure that I have been guilty of
unwarranted attacks on some.  I apologize to those I may have offended.  I feel
strongly about the game and meant nothing personal.
