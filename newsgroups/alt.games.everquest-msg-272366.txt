Not that I've seen.   EQ is definitely easier to solo -- IF
you play a solo class.   EQ2 is definitely easier to solo
IF you don't.

IOW, in EQ, there were some classes which were VERY
difficult to solo -- rogues, for instance.   (Yes, it COULD
be done, but people row boats across the Atlantic too...)
In EQ2, *everyone* CAN solo -- but it's not as nearly as
fast as grouping.
