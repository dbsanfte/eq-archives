It doesn't look like it's going to be as bad as I thought it would be after 
more reading.  Thanks for the explanations.

I was beginning to think no more scares like pulling from the third floor 
of Unrest to the wall and Dizi waiting outside to mez one-two-five(?)or 
more pulls but never knowing and hands shaking over the mezz key as the 
puller's health bar plummets.  That was 100% fun, action, trauma, fear all 
rolled into one.
