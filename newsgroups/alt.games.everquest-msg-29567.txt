Hmm... see, I wondered about the teleport thing, but before he got to 
Qeynos he came up, inspected me, and said something about how I was doing 
so much better than he was - and all I had was the staff and the veil!  
So I figured he wasn't a twink, and didn't really have any 'connections'.  
(I don't know about others, but the friends I have even *outside* the 
guild can't seem to leave a new character of mine alone :) )

Oh oh THAT was the other question I had - I can't find any info on forage 
- is that an Iksar trait or a monk trait?  Can it be upped?  Because I 
haven't really worked on forage with the monk yet, but I gave up with my 
wood elf characters because it was so pitifully bleak in the pickings, 
and I remember reading somewhere that if it's a race-specific trait, 
forage never goes up in skill.

Ooh - now I'm tempted to hit Blackburrow...  any idea about the places 
where Iksars (assuming they're nice little monks instead of mean old 
necros) *aren't* KOS on Antonica, btw?
