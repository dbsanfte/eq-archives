  I suppose you're right that FPSes and offline RPGs are a much more
controlled environment, thus the polygon counts and textures can be higher
individual objects because each "zone" will have a totally fixed next of
objects.

  Still though, the system requirements worry me.  Like I said, I have had
bad experiences playing at Verant's "recommended" requirements in the
past... I expect that people playing below those requirements are not going
to be very happy with the performance they get.

  Also, I could care less about polygon counts and texture sizes.  What
matters to me is whether or not things LOOK good.  If their artists don't do
a good job and end up "squandering" their license to make huge textures and
high polygon counts, we'll have a less than perfect looking game and poor
performance to boot.  Personally, I could care less about the visual aspect
of EQ at this point.  Yes, I'd like things to look good, but I'd much rather
be able to enjoy playing at a decent frame rate for a change, without having
to worry about upgrading my system a year out.

  I'll reserve final judgement until I see how the game actually performs
and see how it actually looks in action.
