Don't forget "Shadowbane r0><><0rz - EQ sv><><0rz".

Been playing EQ since Dec 99 and haven't jumped ship.  I'm just a
casual player with my main being a 66 Cleric.

I'm still doing stuff in game that I thought I'd never get to see.  I
don't care if my equipment is crap compared to the raiders.  I get by
and so does my groups.  The added levels and newer abilities definately
help for seeing stuff this hasn't gone light blue yet.  Plus it's fun
taking out what used to be old raid mobs with a single group. Still
gets the adrenaline pumping when you scrape through a battle and see
that you only have 132 hp's left as the mob dies.

The new expansion should prove more interesting and appealing that GoD
and OoW...although I'm getting to explore some of those as well.  Penty
to do and still plenty of people around on EMarr/MT at least.
