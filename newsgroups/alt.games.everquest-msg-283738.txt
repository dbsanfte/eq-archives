Hi,

I am new to these boards and new to the eq life as a Ranger (Level 36 last
night).  I have been using EQTraders as my primary source for bringing up my
tradeskills.  I would like to make Taelosian Blended Cinnamon Coffee.  I am
stuck on moldy tea leaf.  According to EQTraders it can be foraged in
Barindu, Ferubi, Natimbi, Nedaria's Landing, Qinimi, Riwwi, Sewers of
Nihilia, Uqua and Yxtta. Well, I am only 36 so I thought Nedaria's Landing
might be a safe bet.  That way I could also get some anaconda meat.  I have
been there for hours and hours and hours.  I got tons of plant shoots (which
I can use to bring up baking skills) but not one moldy tea leaf.  Is there a
part of the zone where it might drop more frequently?

Thanks for your time and attention
