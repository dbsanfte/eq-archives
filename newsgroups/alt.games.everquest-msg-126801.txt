 A level 6 mob is still level 6 despite whatever buffs it has from being
charmed.

 As others have said this isn't really anything new. Druids have been
charming and buffing animals since forever. My opinion is that while it
may be funny to some it's still a rather lame thing to do. Sure if you
take out a few newbie twinks big deal. But there are true newbies still
out there and the low levels still suck, despite the recent changes.
