Last night I was in this great group fighting dervs in Ro.  We were doing really well.  By the end I had leveled twice and only a
couple people died.  (Once was my fault, I couldn't target them quick enough to lay hands and save them.)

I should add that I'm a level 11 Paladin.  I had been tanking but when I started I was level 9 and I wasn't the primary tank.  I
almost never took any damage.  I taunted like crazy but never successfully.

At one point some people left and there were fewer of us and I wast the primary tank for a little while.  I ran in on a caster and
he started doing damage to me at 35 points a pop.  There were others and no one was fighting this caster but me.  I was getting
killed.

I layed hands on myself and kept fighting thinking others would jump in soon enough to kill this guy.  I had one bubble of HP left
and I panicked.  I started running away, trying to get away from him.  I got healed a couple times then ran back in again.

I got smacked twice and started running agin, but this time he followed me.  I couldn't shake him and I was running circles around
my group.  Finally he was killed.  I was down to nothing.  I used a lay on hands.  I was running for my life!

Someone said - A few tips - yell for help.  Also, stand still long enought for us to heal you or to get a chance to taunt him away
from you.

I really didn't feel I had time for that.  I thought that if he got in another couple shots I was dead.  If I stood still long
enough for me to inform them and for them to get in there, try to heal me, taunt him away, etc... I'd be dead.

How should I handle being the tank and down to my last bubble and a half.  That's usually when I get worried.  Or is it Everquest
etiquite that tanks die more often?  I liked playing in the group and I don't want to get a bad rap as a bad group player cause I
haul ass when I think I'm going to die.

How do I play well with others?
