So by your definition: If a person does not want to be a twink and they want to
get a desired item for their lower level character that they may already possess
with a higher level character, they must first sell said item to a third party
or vendor and then by it back from them with their alternate character. If a
person already possesses an item, why must they be forced to sell said item to
someone else just to have to turn around it buy it back (usually at higher
price)? And if they are not required to sell at item before the item gets to
their alternate character, what is the difference between someone that buys an
item they would not be able to kill the mob that drops it and that of a person
receive said item from one of their characters that DID kill the mob? All these
things against twinks is of the nature that it is ok for people to possess items
they cannot get themselves with their character so long as they cannot get the
items themselves with ANY of their characters. You can have item if you cannot
kill the mob at all with any of your characters, otherwise you are bad. At least
that is what I am always reading out of most of the complaints against twinking.
