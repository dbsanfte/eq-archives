I just wanted to be the first to point out that you are an idiot.

Please, learn to snip out the irrelevant sections of a post you are
responding too, it would have been extremely easy to miss your response
buried in the middle of an 18kb post.

I don't know anything at all about her, but, IF your assessment of her is
correct, I do agree with your response, regardless of how poorly it was
posted.
