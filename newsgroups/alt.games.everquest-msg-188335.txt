Sheesh ya didnt have to bring up the Monk nerf , that wound had almost
healed. Just for your info though SoE has admitted they made an error
with the monk nerf and would look into the situation, HA dont hold
your breath.

Seriously if SoE sees a class is being under-played then they begin
the process of un-nerfing it, since in all prob they caused the
situation in the first place. Pallys, Rangers, and Necros are prime
examples of this. On the other hand if a class is over-played like
monks were....well lets just say it wasnt good if you had a monk.

So like good little sheep we are guilded by the nerf bat to the
classes they wish played. Thus the reason for interest in Pallys.
