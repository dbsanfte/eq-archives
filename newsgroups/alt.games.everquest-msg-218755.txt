Having watched my wife play her druid to 65, I disagree with your 
assessement of healing.  I think druids are at least on a par with 
shaman in this role, they get some very fast casting heals at higher 
levels which augment their set of spells very well.  It may also be 
important to take into account what else the characters are doing - you 
really want to think hard before having your main slower also be your 
primary healer.
