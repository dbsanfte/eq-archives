50K pp is about 2000 dead hill giants if you think in terms of pure cash
loot.  If a guy was very interested in playing this game a lot, he could
kill 20 HGs a day every day for about 3 months and buy whatever you saw for
sale.  I haven't ever done that, and have never had more than about 7k at
any time in my main's life, but it is definitely an attainable goal.
