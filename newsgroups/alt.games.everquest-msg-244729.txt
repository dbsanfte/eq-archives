Subject: What's a Boat Gnome?

     Read the patch update and I'm not paying much attention I guess but I have
no idea what this means.  Does anyone really use the boats anymore?  I have to
consider the boats as a means of travel to be probably the longest lasting and
greatest flop in Everquest.  I'm sure there are quite a few that other people
can think of but, for me, the boats were an unbelievable dissapointment.  I
could never figure out why back in the old days before pok, when people
actually needed the boats, a player would have to sit on the docks for 15 to 20
minutes to wait for the next boat.  What a frustrating and aggravating
experience that was.  
     I think I just hijacked my own thread there.  Sorry, anyway, what the heck
is a boat gnome?
