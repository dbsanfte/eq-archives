Hmmm...Spectres should be blue to the bard.  How about doing this at the
cave to the Fear portal?  There are around half a dozen or more Spectres
in there.  Spectres only have about 1600 HP, and are on a little over 5
minute spawn cycle, so from the numbers above, it looks like you could
way more than 20/hour...60/hour looks doable!
