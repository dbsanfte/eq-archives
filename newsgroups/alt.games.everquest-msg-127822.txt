Having the source available makes it more likely that some one who does
understand will look at it. It also means that if it is found to do something
it can be directly attributed to him. And, thirdly, since the program is
only reading /loc's out of the log it should be fairly easy to check.

These are probably the files, massaged from the game data, that produced
those nice 3D map images someone posted months ago. At the time I don't
think they named or mentioned how they'd generated the data.
