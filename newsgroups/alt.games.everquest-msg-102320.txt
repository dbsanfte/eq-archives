I dont know what its like on your server, but on mith marr the amount
of coin dropped in netherbian lair has dropped significantly.  i was
soloing netherbians, trogs, and teh sporelings thursday night.
sporelings dropped around 5pp each, trogs were about 4-5, and
netherbians were dropping like 2-4pp.  From friday nght on, im lucky
to get 1pp from a sporeling, a few gold from trogs, and some silver
from the netherbians.  i rememnber readin back in the day that the
more a mob is killed, the less coin it will drop.  this seems to bring
truth to that, although it doesnt make sense it would drop that
quickly without verant doin somethin.  just my 2cp
