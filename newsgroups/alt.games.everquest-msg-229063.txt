With the last patch, you can now buy containers in the bazaar. Player
vendors can turn their containers into an npc (dont recall the name -
see the patch message) and get a token which they sell in the bazaar-
when you buy the token, you go to same npc and get your container.
Pretty cool - about time too.

Ever play Diablo 2? Kinda like that - you either get an augment to
drop or purchase one with LDON points. Then go to a "birdbath" looking
thing at an LDON camp - put the item in with the augment - hit combine
and presto - your item is augmented. Keep in mind there are different
types of augments - before you spend your hard earned points - be sure
you can use it. Most existing items in the game have type 7 slots (off
hand i know that Gnome cultural armor doesnt have any slots). You can
remove the augment later using a solvent purchased at a magus at an
LDON camp - but you dont get the augment back.

See above. Augments are LDON only either purchased using LDON points
or dropped in an LDON dungeon (as of now - who knows with future
expansions coming).

Never played a ranger. You might try Marus Seru. Most people hack it
out in Paladul Caverns till 24 or so, but be original! Be a pepper!
Try something different!
