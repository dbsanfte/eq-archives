I recommend saving them.  If you should find yourself in the position
of wanting to develop a long unused skill at higher level you'll likely
be very happy that you can spend those points and a little cash to
get the skill up into usable range quickly.  You don't mention your
class, but this is especially true of melee skills, which can only be
raised in combat against xp-giving mobs (yes, there are "scams" using
pets and the like, but they just reduce/eliminate the risk of death,
they don't change the fact that it can take a very long and tedious
time to raise a weapon skill).
