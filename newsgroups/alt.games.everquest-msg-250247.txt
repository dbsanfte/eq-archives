This list != the list that's been handed out IMO, as the vast
majority of the feedback presented to them at the summit
was put aside for them to read later, but I will agree to
disagree and we will see what they come out with in their
official statement further down the line.

"At the end of the summit, the SOE staff had a meeting and
released this sheet at dinner..."

Heh, OK, point taken, slight linguistic problem there, as a
northerner I took "dinner" to mean mid-day meal, but fair
enough. It doesn't change the fact that it was in response to
what was TALKED about during the day and was only
the stuff that could be fixed QUICKLY. I'm sure that leaves
out a lot of stuff for the midlevel.

Most people who were there agree that the list came out
of the discussions that were had, rather than the bulk of
the stuff that was given to them hard-copy, but come on,
we've said this enough times now.

To be honest? I couldn't give a rat's about the motivation
for them doing it, I'm almost 100% sure it is a mainly financial
one, but if it gets the job done, so be it. Smedley acknowledged
that this whole process is 2 years late... I agree that they had
the information and the opportunity for a long time now, and
should have done something with it. Perhaps this is, as one
staffer was reported to have said off the record, that for the
first time people are leaving with somewhere else to go, and it's
lit a fire under them. I'm still inclined to believe given the
unusually candid nature of the process here that they're on the
level. Either that or it's really sick PR... if that makes me naive
in your eyes fine :) If nothing gets done, I will be the first to admit
it, when the time comes, but until then I'll keep sending my
feedback.

I think it says something about you that you would think that
because my opinion differs from yours, I must be an "insider".
But no, I've had enough second-hand experience of the games
industry to know it's not a job I could do.
