    The rumour is that since XP was "too easy" to obtain, especially for
people flagged to go into the Plane of Valor, that various nerfs will be
enacted. Some of the rumours include:

(1) HPs doubled on all mobs in PoV.
(2) Many mobs to be given the ability to summon.
(3) The "high level mob XP bonus" to be scaled back.
(4) The levels of PoV mobs to be decreased, while still at the same
difficulty.

    Guess we'll see what happens, huh?
