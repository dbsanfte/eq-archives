My tactic.  Basically snare, root, dot and get out of range of them.
Reapply. When you think the mob is low enough let lose with all your
nukes. Make sure you are buffed up and hopefully have some type of
regen on. I do not care much about interupting there cast because I
find it to be hopeless one on one.  I beat the crap out of Sarnaks
with that tactic.  If you are indoors get a group.

If the caster has a pet. Snare the Caster and let pet haul ass after
you. Run Run SNARE, Root go back to Caster and kick his but as I
described at top.

Nothing is for sure but I am a totally ill-equiped Druid at level 60.
Now I just do raids when a group lets me in, heal low-bies and see the
world.  Ohh and PL my Warrior.
