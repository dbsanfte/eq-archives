Sounds like a bad reason for a feature: force people to wait a long time for
the one they want so that they will give up in disgust and try one they
don't want. I would prefer to see a better balance in adventure types such
that every one of them would be appealing to roughly the same number of
players. Hopefully they're working on tweaking the balance toward this goal.
