My rogue...

Heres his Magelo: http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=569520

earting from yeli too)
Neck: Bloodshrine Necklace
Face: faceguard of bentos the hero
Head: Mithril Helm
Fingers: Velium fire wedding rings
Bracers: Silver chitin wristband
              Bracelet of fortitude
Arms: Hardened grey flesh sleeves
Hands: Crystal chitin gloves
Shoulders: Barbed dragonscale pauldrons
Chest: Fungi
Back: Cloak of flames

Primary: The horn of Hsagra
Secondary: Long sword of Ethereal Energy
Range: Some crappy bow with 200 range

Masks: Mask of deception
            Burnoose of the Halfbreed

He started off as a twink, pretty nicely geared, but now he's almost 50 (lvl
47, 2 days /played wee) and well, the gear isn't so hot anymore.

Some slots suck, some are ok, some will need changing/replacing based on
completed quests (e.g epic, BoB)

Basically looking for input on what slots to replace, and with what.  The
stuff that comes to mind for me is replacing his fungi with..... something.
Possibly changing his bracers to BoB (which is best, rogue wise).. cloak, im
not sure about - thats linked in with epic anyway.

His ears and neck suck, his mask is ok..  helm is decent, but im sure theres
better.  Im not sure if theres a better bow to go for, or its time to forget
about archery and get a nice hp/stats item there?

I bought the tae ew chain legs last night, 8kpp - was debating those, or
mylokar (didn't see what made mylok worth 15kpp tho - just the min level ?)

Shoulders- these are a crappy slot to upgrade imo (at least from my monks
perspective).. with avatar his melee stats are all maxed (str,agi, dex) and
buffed, his sta is 220 or so

He isn't gonna be getting high end loot and vexthal Veng gear, I do have a
small circle of friends to drop smaller targets that might offer an upgrade
tho.

These are: 65monk, 65shaman, 65chanterx2, 65cleric x2, 62 cleric, 60cleric,
60warrior, 65ranger, 55bard

(62 cleric, 1x65 chanter, 65 shaman, 55 bard = bots)..  I may be able to
rely on other guildies for specific things,  but the classes above are
really my limit on "raid" targets (upgrades for the warrior, a ranger twink
of the cleric, and clerics would be nice too..  as its a group thing we all
should benefit)

And in regards to his epic.. I know its not one of the most involving epics,
but im also not one of the most patient people...  h8 camps, h8 farming, h8
anything that takes time!!

I want to set myself a challenge of finishing his epic, from start to
finish, in a day.  This is dependent upon guild raids.. but the target date
is likely to be next weekend.

Any tips hints or tricks that could improve my "epic in a day" chances?
And then should that be successful..  what about weapons?  Epic mainhand I
understand, but thats gonna make 1 of my other weapons useless (or maybe
even both of them, I dunno)

Also, I only have 2 illusion masks..  which of the rest are best to get
myself, and which should I just try and buy?

And utility stuff.. I know mechanical lockpicks have a +lockpick mod, isnt
there gloves or something too?  What all gives skill mods that are
applicable to rogues?

Money isn't an issue..  but I'll be hard pushed spending 300k on like, an
AoW mask, when the most I've ever spent on my monk for a single item is
like, 80k..

Long post..  but grateful for any feedback and info!

Thanks
