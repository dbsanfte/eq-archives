As I said before, it appears a list of general who's online is
separate from a list of who's in a particular zone. In a /who all,
you're querieing (Okay, sue me. My spellchecker won't turn anything up
and I'm not sure how it's spelled really. Toss me a hand?) the former
list.

Problem here is, it's one of those cases where I understand the issue
but can't rightly explain it. ;-p
