I'm always skeptical of those numbers for some reason. I've had several 
pages up of various sorts, and they never suggest that the non-IE market 
share is that big. Granted I'm not the most hit site out there, or even 
close, (I can't use my site stats to check this because they count me so 
they're all skewed up hehehe get it... skewed... OK. nevermind *sigh*) 
but my numbers IRL tend to show a big lead for IE (again, my site won't 
work now because I buggered the counter and it counts my hits and 
shouldn't.)
