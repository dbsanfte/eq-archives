/sigh
Well sure, but I was replying to Graeme's assertion, not to the OP.
And while many (most?) players don't have a bazaar trader up all the
time, all it would take is one 6 day stretch where you did keep a
trader on to render your connection useless for the remainder of
that month.  That's the problem with ## hours/month plans, they just
don't serve you well when, for whatever reason, your usage spikes.
