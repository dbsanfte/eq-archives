}I have killed the ac 3 times in sro with my druid. Each time i was
}just porting in and going to oasis. First time i was kiting a SG and
}got jumped by the AC too. I was about 40m and blew the rest of my mana
}on resisted nukes on the AC. I had to kill both with the dot from my
}es vambraces but not beofre they almost killed me. Second time I was
}pling a guildie and got jumped by the AC. And the third time i was
}running thruthe zone to oasis and saw it on track. First time i was
}about lvl 40 and last time about lvl 49. And each time it seemed very
}highly MR and a hard kill for a green mob. Thank goodness for MQing.

Actually, he isn't that high MR.  He's high FR.  Scoriae never lands, but Ice 
or Dementia kicks his ass.
