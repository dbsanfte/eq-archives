You know... This sounds almost like an arguement one of the directors in my
company said to my boss about getting hardware for their statistics guy:

"I don't see why we can't get hardware for this guy, a person who will be
doing work and requires this hardware that will save thousands of dollars in
research in house that we spend with another company?"

My boss responded back:

"Just because the guy will save us money in the long run, doesn't mean we
have the money now to spend on it right this moment to get him this
hardware."

Where is the analogy, you ask?  You are currently saying, "Why should I pay
$3 more for no improvement?"  So you are telling us right now, you are
paying $3 more and supposing nothing has happened what so ever.  Ok...  But
then...  This is saying the same thing, "We should be spending money that we
are going to save..."  We haven't exactly seen the outcome of increases yet.
Service is trying to be maintained as best as possible, perhaps an
improvement might happen with the increase.  One will never know, but we
can't claim it won't change unless we try.
