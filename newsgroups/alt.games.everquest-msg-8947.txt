Last week there must have been something in the stars...my guild and I would
pickup some of the most bizarre characters into our groups...we had this one
kid when we hunted in PAW, who I shit you not, was the biggest coward I had
ever seen...we thought he was just roleplaying and making us laugh, but as
soon as someone shouted train...he gated out. I was like "where'd he go?"
and he answered "I got scared and gated" I was like "well get back in here
you wussy" which he replied "I'm on my way but I was bound in OT"

Oman...we were laughing so hard we were in tears...he finally made it back
but wouldn't come back into paw...instead he made the mistake of saying "I'm
not coming back in there...it's too dangerous...so I'm just gonna sit at the
zone line and soak up the exp if you don't mind."

Group leader: You are the weakest link, goodbye!
