I've been seeing a lot of blue names on Rallos Zek that I've never
seen before. I know for a fact that it's possible to change your name
(know a guy this happened to). I don't doubt people are switching
servers, too. There have been some people that have disappeared,
claiming to have transferred to a blue server. I don't know any of
them very well, though.
