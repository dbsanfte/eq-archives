    Holy crap Ben, usually you write good stuff, but this is utter shite
mate.

    I guess I'd be what you might call a whining casual, and there isn't a
single thing in that list I even like, let alone asked for.

    Tier 2/3 exp requested by casuals? When they came out we couldn't even
access those zones.

    Maybe there is a specific set of "casuals" that want everything handed
to them on a silver platter who have requested all this shit and ruined EQ.
I don't believe it, but if you want to you certainly can - what you can't do
is lump everyone who doesn't raid 3x a week in an uberguild in with this
category of person. Not without looking like a class A twit.
