Im a 60 monk.

I don't think healing mobs works, and buffing only works if they are charmed
first

With him always grouping that wouldn't really cause a problem (tho if I
could use my cleric and keep casting cheal it would be pretty damn funny)

How many mobs can a bard ....crowd control when all hell breaks lose and
somehow hangon?  And whats the absolute maximum at level 60?

Im well aware that outdoors I don't have a chance in hell of catching him...
Whats the most mobs a bard can kite outdoors though?
