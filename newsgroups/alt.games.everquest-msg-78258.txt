Subject: What would be a good dex item for a Warrior?

I've got a L10 Human Warrior of Mithaniel Marr, wearing a Serpentine Bracer on
one wrist and a Erollisi Bracer on the other. His dex is 78 with them on. I
would like to replace the Erollisi Bracer with another one that boosts dex, but
I don't want another Serpentine Bracer. What would be a good dex boost item for
the wrist that I could buy for around 150pp, if any?

I can afford to change his mask, belt or one of his rings, if there's a better
item that would fit in one of those slots. 

(I need to boost dex because I have two different weapons with procs)
