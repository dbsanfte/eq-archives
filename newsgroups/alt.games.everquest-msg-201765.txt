From days of Table top RP I have don't actually have any good memories of
D&D...mainly because when I played I was very young and as I grew up and the
group I was with moved to other games it became apparent how crap the system
was...Oddly they still use the (d20) system and worse, have ported to other
games that once had better systems /shrug.

Best RP memories were early days of Vampire TM, although I felt that our
GM's insistance of using all the Worlds of Darkness(tm)..kinda Cheapened
things and SLA Industries, still my favourite.
