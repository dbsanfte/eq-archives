Just looking around to see if there are others In Rockhampton and in
surrounding areas that play EQ?  We are two (2) guys that have Characters on
the Lanys T'Vyl Server and we would like to meet others that play in Rocky
or in other areas.  We can't be the only 2 in Central Queensland that play
EQ.



We are genuine so get back to us rockycub@optusnet.com.au



Cheers

Steve
