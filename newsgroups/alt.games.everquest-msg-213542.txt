Also, since you're not longer KoS, you can get into skyshrine to turn in 
giant warrior helms and frost and storm giant toes to Lieutenant Melvin (or 
something, take the first right after you enter from the WL side, you can't 
miss him).

Took girlfriend's monk from scowling to dubious with a couple bags of 
those.  The helms are much better hits than the toes, 20 toes didn't get 
her to apprehensive from wherever she was in dubious.  Check your bazaar 
for the helms, you might be able to get some at a reasonable price.
