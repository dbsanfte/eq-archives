I havent' argued hate OR fear. I've argued that you're either:

A>  a pussy who doesn't love his loved ones enough to be willing to
defend them

-OR_

B> An idiot who has been so brainwashed by the liberal agenda that he
doesn't understand REAL LIFE. Bad things happen in real life and
sometimes a person has to be willing to defend himself. I have knife
scars to prove that. I also have a friend who's still alive after a
home invasion due tot he fact that he was armed. If he were in your
world, who knows what would have happened. But I guarantee it wouldn't
have been good.
