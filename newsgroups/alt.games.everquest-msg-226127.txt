Most spells drop off exp mobs, there's no money needed to buy them. 
Sure, you -can- buy them if you are swimming in cash, but you don't have 
to.  The exception to that seems to be the 65 spells and some of the 60 
spells, which drop off raid level mobs... that might be a reason to stop 
at 64, but not to stop at 61.  From 61 to 65, you are seeing spells that 
are better than the 60 ones you are missing, but dropping off mobs you 
are killing in a single group.

OK< they dont' really drop, of course, but the ethereal and spectral 
parchments you hand in to get them do.  My mage got his first ethereal 
parchment at level 50 in an exp group in the low 50s.  By the time you 
are 65 you'll be refusing rolls on ethereal parchments because you have 
all your 61 62 spells and think its fair to let the less fortunate get 
the chance.

Even if you take the cash approach, at level 65 your earning potential 
is much higher than at 61, even if you somehow manage to have only level 
61 spells.  People won't know you are so woefully underequipped, and 
you'll have more HP, more mana, better resists, and get resisted less, 
and many of your spells will have a larger effect at 65 than at 61. 
Since leveling from 61 to 65 is a cakewalk, about as hard as leveling 41 
to 45, instead of the hardship the 50s levels can be, there's little 
reason not to do it, unless there's some favorite camp of yours that is 
currently barely dark blue and which will become cyan or green as you 
level up further.
