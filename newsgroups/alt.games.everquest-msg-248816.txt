    Hmmm.  I wonder how many cancellations and how low the number of
pre-orders of OoW were that prompted them to finally start?  And it was
weird for me reading that.  It almost seemed like he, or one of his
underlings, had been reading some of the recent "is EQ dying" type threads
that have been going on here.  I have my doubts that that might have been
the case.  It seems more likely that they've been deleting (I assume they
would delete them) a large number of those types of posts on their official
forums.

   So any idea who the players are they are inviting to speak to the
developers?  I haven't gotten mine yet.  Have any agers?  Personally, I
think they're going to be asking key members in power guilds.  And while
they certainly should have a voice, it would also be nice if they were
seeking out and talking to a few non-power, but still long time players.  

   All in all I feel this is a good thing.  I just wonder how much change
is really going to come from it.
