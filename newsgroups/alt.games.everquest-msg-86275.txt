Speaking as another 25 Beastlord, you may wish to consider hotkeying
/pet back off.  In the situation described, I'll just start mashing
that hotkey.  If you only hit it once, the pet will turn around to go
back to guard spot, then get hit, then start fighting again.  So you
keep hitting the hotkey and the pet DOES eventually get back to where
it should be.

Worst case, I'll stand there and absorb some damage (while walking
backwards) at the same time I'm hitting /pet back off.

It works.  Really!
