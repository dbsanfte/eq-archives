...or, things that "they" neglected to to you about on your
flight to Norrath....
The shops, inns, etc do not really exist. At least the ones in the
East Commonlands (which is about as far as I've gotten, having launched
my first character in Freeport).
I knew something was up when I kept seeing the snakes slither through when I
am haggling with the merchants...but to be attacked by BEARS and LIONS
when I am INSIDE a tightly shuttered place of business is intolerable!
The authorities shall hear about this outrage!  The construction guilds
will be soundly disciplined!  [ I particularly  liked the Invisible Lioness
in one shop...now that was confusing...]
After the gods have remedied the crummy ethereal buildings, then they can
get to work
on repairing the ethereal trees...which the creatures are also walking
through.
Highly irregular you know...must put a stop to this sort of thing as
well...a good
creation is a disciplined creation...
