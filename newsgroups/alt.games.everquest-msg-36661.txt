  If your an Elf or an Erudite.... They seem to go out of there way to mess
with you... Especially Azzar. My friend had the same problem as an elf. It
took us forever to get him in and getting out we had to get a port.
  As far as it being low level... It aint. Don't buy the hype. They say 5th
level..... The halls are littered with the corpses of 5th level Heretics
trying to hunt in there. Defiantly one of if not the most annoying places
I've ever been to in EQ. But worth it once you get the hang of it.
