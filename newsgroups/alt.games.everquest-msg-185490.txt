Except that unless they have really finally fixed serverside filtering, you 
are not really reducing bandwidth, just no longer displaying the spam.  One 
possibility is that with the badwords filter on (seems LoY turned it on for 
most if not all folks), the links get mangled, perhaps the mangled links 
have something to do with it.  I noticed that my links now display 
correctly after having turned off the filter.
