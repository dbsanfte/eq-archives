    Hello there!  Yep, hunting greenies for a quest piece is perhaps the
definitive EQ experience.  Good luck with getting your drops!  If you want
tips and a good selection of EQ links, you might wan to visit the
alt.games.everquest FAQ, which I have linked in my sig.  A bit wordy, but
full of good information and even a tips section.
