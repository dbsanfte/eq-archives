No when you try to ration something it causes scarcity. You tell the owner
that he can only sell one gallon and only for a buck and suddenly he and
every other man like him sells none. Then the people who cannot get out of
dodge die. Happens each and every time. Then the socialists who of course
love everybody best sit back and lament the terrible tradegy where so many
people lost there lives.
