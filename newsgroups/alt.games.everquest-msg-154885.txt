Losing the head of the guild is a terrible blow to any guild. I
watched how it destroyed my first guild and my current guild has a
problem the leader stepped down over the "uber issue" and it's affects
on our relationships between lower and higher level members and
raiding. In both cases, Guildleader/officer bickering played a role.

Not much you can do but rebuild. Trouble is you have officers who act
like guild leaders from time to time which undermines your authority
as they put their priorities ahead of yours. In some ways you are
titular head since your authority seems to flow from them, which makes
you the "fall guy" when it all falls apart or doesn't go the way the
officers think it ought to. As far as I am concerned, you are the
guild leader, what you say goes, if need be fire and promote new
officers. Get officers who agree with your vision of where the guild
is to go.

Better you fail because you choose a path and it didn't pan out versus
officers bickering over what they think you ought to do. If officers
don't like the direction they can do the guild a favor and step down.
Officers need to help execute your vision, not run or tell you how to
run the guild.

I can't begin to tell you how many bad officers I have run across in
guilds. They offer little support, no raid ideas, and just whine and
moan about whether they think things are going right.
