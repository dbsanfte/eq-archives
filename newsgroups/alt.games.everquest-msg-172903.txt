The next age will be created using things I currently have no understanding
of, as this age has been created using things the old creator has no
understanding of and created by a man who will be more impressive than I,
and will come from my seed and my Queen who has already been chosen, and
whose people shall rule the new Earth, because they have been seen as worthy
in my eyes, but the other people shall not pass away but flourish in their
kind as their works are also good and the pleasures of their wisdom and
temples of the spirit also good and pleasurable to behold.
