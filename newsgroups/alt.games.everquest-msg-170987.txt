No, No, No... Make them.  They're actually cheaper thet way (24-28cp for 5
arrows).  You should use a looted hunting bow, though as they are the lowest
damage bows out there.  Problem is range (hunting bow 50 range and arrows
are 50 range).  You can up it to range 150 arrows for not too much more.
The plus side is that your fletching will go to about 56 with the long range
1 damage arrows (field pt/wood shaft/small nock/parabolic fletching).
