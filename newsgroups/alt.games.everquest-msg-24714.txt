Not really.

I think that Ishva is the really badass looking blue on blue robe isn't it?
Hmm...
That is very appealing...what items should I get to get back up to 200 int if I
get an isvha? Currently if I take away the Crystalline robe I'm at 196 int. The
cha is cool, too.

Yup, already changed the ones on my list to wolf-hide.

I dunno, under a certain point they really are life-savers...and I've noticed
that all the uber guild chanters have a set on, too. What would you suggest
instead? Moonstone Rings? I can see that since I have ~200 int.

Doesn't hugely matter, I have 200+ int with nightshade or runed circlet.

Thanks, they seemed very stat-economical at 7 each.

CB belts to 12 and group in oasis from there. Of course there will be a brief
period of casting low level spells to raise skill.

Many thanks for the advice. Also, I am going to post the current hotkey ideas I
have for my enc below...I'm sure they'll get changed a bit so go ahead and
start suggesting...I made them thinking of what I've seen encs do in groups of
mine as well as looking at the enc spells

1- single target mez (/g <| Attempting to Mez %T |>)
2- ae mez (/g <| Attempting to Mez EVERYTHING |>)
3- tash (/g <| Attempting to Tash %T |>)
4- slow (/g <| Attempting to Slow %T |>)
5- mem blur (/g <| Attempting to Mem Blur %T |>)
6- break (/g <| Break mez of %T at will |>)
7- ouch (/g <| %T is trying to eat my face! Get it off! |>)
8- l/o om (/g <| Low/out of mana, careful! |>)
9- stun (/g <| Attempting to stun EVERYTHING! |>)
10-  root (/g <| Attempting to root %T |>)

Thanks a ton for the help and tips and advice and things of that nature, highly
appreciated.
