This has happened to me several times:

- Tank makes disasterously bad pull.
- I cast Lessor Succor.
- Party wipes in less than 10 seconds.
- The group messages start coming in: "Why the HELL didn't you EVAC?!"
- My mind thinks, "It's not an instant cast spell, you dimwit."
- I type, "I cast it right away.  The party wiped before it went off."

Similar experiences have occurred where I just couldn't channel it
through my beating and group members got mad.
