Watch the quoting please :)   I didn't say a monk without primal is a
"fucking liability", some other whining dipshit did.

How do you know the damage was the same?   What weapons were they both

Also ambidex only has 1 level, thinking off the top of my head here, 2hb has
3 levels (or 5.. i'll check when I get home)
