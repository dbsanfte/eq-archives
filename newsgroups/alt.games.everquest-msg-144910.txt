Showing up somewhere with the wrong spells memmed and stumbling
into the mobs on autopilot, or having invis drop while naked are not
fair tests of your capabilities.  Raptors will be challenging, but I don't

think impossible or even outrageous for your combo, I used to tank
unslowed raptors when I was a 54 cleric with a 52 ranger buddy doing
damage dealing, I must have had around 900AC and 2500hp and certainly
less damage mitigation than you have already, of course with only a
warrior
and a shaman pet to do damage things won't fall down as quickly (I
assure you I outdamage a shaman pet and this particular ranger desperately

outdamages a 50 warrior who didn't put "twinked" in his self description)
unless the shaman starts spending mana on things other than haste, slow,
and heals.  On the other hand, if things get rough you can always root
and rot/potshot.  Point is, raptors certainly can be single pulled even
without
harmony (I know, ranger has harmony... but mostly we didn't bother, and
I pulled to help me keep aggro)

Don't see the EW entrance done much, no idea how well you can
single pull there.  The WL side, though, should be about your level,
you can do a bunch of singles outside, other than the entrance pair
which you'd have to break with harmony initially or inside you can
pull several singles but might occaisionally get doubles; root mez
or zone split or something if that happens.

Try the entrance to the Hole.  Elementals come in pairs, so shaman will
have to play "mezzer" keeping one out of the fight with root.  But they
are a timed spawn, so once you initially split the pairs you can keep them

split.  Then its an easy matter to do a cycle of 2, 4, 6, or 8, depending
on how fast you can kill them.  If you aren't dead set against other
people, you will likely be able to add members in to your group in
order to give you access to the other half the entrance, which is to say
any of the 8 spawn you weren't already handling, then a two spawn
of crusaders, a roaming crusader, and then.. what is it, a two spawn
of crusaders and a rock golem?  A really good group can also grab
a couple more rock golems out of the tower still without going over
the ledge, and I've seen at least one group capable of pulling stuff
from below the ledge up to fight, although they had abandoned the
entrance mobs by then.  At any rate, the entrance mobs are earth
elementals, and the exp bonus in the Hole makes them really good
kills if you can handle them.  You might even see loot, there's a
really nice bow (part of ranger epic I think, but its no drop, so loot it
if there's no ranger around) some of the best melee shoulders in the
game (IGS) and Iron Oxides, which are selling for upwards of 500pp
each these days; all rare drops, but they certainly give you something
to hope for..
