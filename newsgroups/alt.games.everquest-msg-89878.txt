Hell.  If 40,000 people actually did respond, then everyone that should read
this and send me $1.00 (shipping and handling), I will send to you the
secret to leveling 1-60 in ONE DAY -and- as an added bonus, I will send you
the Beastlords EPIC secret, thats RIGHT, it HAS been completed, though
people are keeping it a secret in order to get YOU HARD EARNED MONEY!  Dont
pay someone fortunes to get information that should remain free, you are
only paying for the photocopy of this information.

Please send a SASE (self addressed stamped envelope) to:

Igotz Yomuny
1421 Skamerc Lane
Dummas, AZ 31120-1421


Actually, I could only wish people were so naive, hell, I wish only 5% of
the EQ players were that naive.  I wouldnt mind $20,000 in my pocket.
