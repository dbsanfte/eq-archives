Could have been because of the classes I was playing, I guess...played a 
druid, an enchanter, and a summoner...all level 11 when I quit playing. 
Well, 'quit' playing is kinda strong, perhaps when I 'suspended playing for 
a while' would be better. :) I was starting up a bard, but hadn't even 
gotten him off the newbie island yet when I returned first to PlanetSide 
then to EQ1 (or EQLive if you prefer). But honestly, I never found the 
yellow and orange mobs all that tough to kill...died a few times while 
fighting them, but for the most part, managed to kill them pretty easily.
