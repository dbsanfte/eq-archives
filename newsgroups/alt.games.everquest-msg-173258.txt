I had KEI cast on my 16 Druid a while back. Actually, I was looking to trade
SOW for "Any" mana buff so I could sit and work on deficient casting skills
(conjuration in particular, but the others too). A rather nice 60+ chanter
had me come over and dropped C3 on me as part of his "paying" run, and I
gave SOW in return (some trade!).

He did it not to help my hunting, but to work on my skills. By sitting there
and casting conjure food and conjure drink half a billion times as well as
some other spells, I got something like 120 skillups out of that KEI. I just
sat in various newbie zones casting Skin Like Rock (Abjuration improvements)
and SOW on the newbs - plus gave them stacks of food and drink to preserve
their newbie supplies (hope they remembered to move my food/drink to the top
of the list).

Anyway, I got tons of skillups, killed virtually zero mobs (did drop
stinging swarm on several greenies while working on conjuration), and helped
countless lowbie toons. I remember how much I appreciated the "Free Buffs"
when I was first starting out and even now when starting a new toon - it's
nice to drop in and return the favor from time to time. I'll have to do
something like that again when that druid makes 30 or 40. lol.
