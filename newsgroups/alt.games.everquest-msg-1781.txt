Okey, having done some preliminary research, the sphinx is NOT a statue, but is
in fact a mob. Level 40.  So is it wandering around there? Pretty stationary?
Will it just randomly aggro on innocent little basilisk hunting wizards?
Everything else about this zone looks pretty good.
   Also the route there doesn't look too fearsome. Since I'm already in oasis, I
guess I can just run through S.Ro, then along the right wall of Innothule and
take the road throuh Feeroot to the LR zone?  I've only ever been to Innothule
once before, and that was just back and forth from Guk. Any good pointes on this
run at my level?
