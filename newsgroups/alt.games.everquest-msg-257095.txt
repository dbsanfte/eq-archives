I can list one blatant example off the top of my head.  As mentioned
in the post where I mistakenly ranted about Channelling Focus as if
it were Persistent casting, the AA Spell Casting Subtlety is beyond
stupid for SKs.  SKs are tanks that depend on their spells for aggro,
making all of their spells produce less +hate weakens the character.
SCS is worse than worthless to SKs, it has a negative value.

And you say you're a Paladin, please describe a real (not imaginary,
but actual and verifiable) gameplay benefit from Act of Valor.  For
that matter, what is the benefit of +INT to a Paladin?  +WIS for an
SK?
