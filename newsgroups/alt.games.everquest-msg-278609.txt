If you want to explore new area's EQ2 IS for you. Like someone else
said, if you catch agro from something, just run from it. My main is a
27 paladin, and I have fully explored Zek, Enchanted lands, Rivervale,
and a few others. 

EQ2 was revamped to where there are TONS of solo mobs now. Infact, it
is kinda sad how many solo mobs there are now. Alot of the group mobs
are now solo mobs, so that was kinda disheartening. 

From what I hear about WoW, it is fun....  for the first few weeks.
After you reach the highest level (which is easy and quick to do) there
is nothing else to do. I have 9 RL friends that all joined WoW when it
came out. After 2 months they had all quit because it was boring. Oh,
that and if it is a busy night, you have to wait in line to play.
