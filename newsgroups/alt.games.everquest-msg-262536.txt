Lets substitute all the 2nd person references 'you' to 3rd person 'he' 
shall we. This isn't my argument; I'm just the guy that sorted out the 
tax bracket numbers.

FWIW I think the 100k guy was a bad example. If it were my argument, I'd 
note that the average american makes more like 32k and deal with him. He 
doesn't have the dispoable income to save much, nor is he a homeowner. 
He's a lower tax bracket sure, but he's bitten much harder by the 
licensing, registration, & regulatory fees, tolls, parking, exise taxes, 
sales taxes, levies, speeding tickets and so on because many of those do 
not scale with income much, and so impact lower income groups harder (as 
a % of their income). Verizon Wireless' fine print discloses taxes may 
be up to 30% of your phone bill for example.

Plus you have to factor a percentage of proxy taxes (taxes paid by 
businesses which are ultimately paid by joe-average in the form of 
higher prices (e.g. duties, excise tax paid on fuel transporting 
goods,...etc)

When its all said and done, will it be 50%? I couldn't say, but 50% will 
definately be within striking distance.
