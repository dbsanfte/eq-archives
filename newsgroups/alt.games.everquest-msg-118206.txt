Used to be I would go to Orc Hill and Crushbone and hand the orcs therein
either Fine Steel or Velium weapons.  Down-side:  NPCs can proc a weapon
regardless of level (sometimes newbies/lowbies get lit up by velium shards).
Up-side: Killing an orc often meant gaining a magic weapon, or at least fine
steel.  Since they patched that up, They won't take the weapons anymore.
After another patch, they would again, but I think it has since been
re-patched.
