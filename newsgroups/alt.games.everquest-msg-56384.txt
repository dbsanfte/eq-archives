This was my only complaint on the patch. I just NOW got my druids forage
ability well above 100 and started foraging up the "good" stuff. Now I'll
get more food.

Don't they realize that those with skill over 100 ALREADY have enough food
to feed an army? I've already banked an entire backpack full of fruits,
berries, and veggies for when I decide to skill-up my brewing. Besides the
bank I'm packing a stack of roots, rabbit meat, veggies, and three stacks
of pods-o-water. I DON'T NEED ANY MORE FRIGGEN FOOD!
