At the time, there was no "honorable" method of getting it.  That was
Verant's bone-headed idea.  I don't think players should be penalized
because the developers didn't have a clue at the time.  As soon as the quest
was implimented, yes, they were responsible.  Added to the above penalties,
I think having the Pally-killer ghoulbane should make the Paladin KOS in the
Plane of Growth, and if you try to turn it in for your Firey Avenger....
stand by.

Depends on what race you play.  Each race has a different vision of what a
rogue should be.  Still, if you removed backstab, what use would the rogue
be in combat?

"Tribal Healer" is not the same thing as a healer for only the tribe.  A
navy Hospital Corpsman (HM) may be the navy and marine's healer, but they
can still patch up a soldier or even an enemy combatant with little trouble.

Depends.  Some priests are called only to preach to their parisoners, but
some are missionaries, doing works outside their area.  Clerics could hold
both as a calling.

Looking at some of the faction trouble my Warrior of Zek had, I wonder at
times.  Still, who best to raise an army of the dead, than the god who most
likely made them dead.
