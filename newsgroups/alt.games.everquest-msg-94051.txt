This may not have anything to do with it.. but I also hate it when you do a
shout that you have a bad mob following you to the guards, and to get out of
the way... the guards take your train down .. then you still shout
sorry(even though you shouted train) and ppl shout that you almost killed
them.. the whole time the mob was on my tail!!!  ok.. how the hell did the
mob stop chasing me...attack them.. then catch up to me again and get killed
by the guards that I pulled them to? hmmm I think it is just the idiots that
like to make you feel bad for something you didn't do.. thinking you didn't
pay attention to your mob following you!

just a funny situation that happened to me recently ;-)
