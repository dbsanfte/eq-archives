Points totals are lower for lower level groups.  I've never
failed to complete a mission within allotted time.  But the
highest number of points I've gotten was as a 38 in a group
averaging 36 on a "hard" mission; I got 5 points.  While lower
level, I got as few as 3 points, and I've also gotten 4 points. 
So apparantly in your 30s, the range is 3 to 5 per mission...
which means a LONG time if you are shooting for some of those
1400+ point drops.

I'm not entirely sure exactly what point totals are given at
various levels for various level groups, though, I could have
said "400 and 300" and still the rest of my post would stand; the
points don't seem to be different for a 4 man, 5 man, or 6 man
group if all other factors remain the same

Splendid
