Nope. No mana cost reduction at all. The necklace only glows
when you cast a spell that uses a component. Just every once in
while no component is used. Seems to be about 1 in 10 or so.

See above. Since the spell makes enchanted velium bars if
you get one without using up a regular velium bar as the component
you have essentially created an enchanted bar for FREE.
