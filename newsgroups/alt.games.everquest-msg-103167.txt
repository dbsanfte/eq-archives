Agreed.

Since a ranger is effectively a cross between druid & warrior, both of
which halflings can be, I don't see why a halfling ranger is so
difficult to accept.  There's the argument that halflings are too urban
and stay-at-home, but that isn't really true.  Druids are certainly
outdoor types.  Ranger is not such a huge leap.

Not to mention the ranger guild just one zone away - why wouldn't
halflings have some communications with the Kithicor ranger guild?
Doesn't the character description when you create a halfling ranger
actually mention this, along with the impetus provided by the pickclaw
takeover of Runnyeye to train up some halfling scouts?
