I top post. Why? This way people read what is most current. If they want to
know more about theongoing discussion, they can scroll down and review the
past.

No need to "correct" this post, as to me it is "correct" already. It's what
*I* prefer. If you like bottom posting, fine. It's not for me. I like to see
the posters msg up front. If I want to review what someone else said, I'll
scroll.
