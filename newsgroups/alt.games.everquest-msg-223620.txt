Fyi - below are not porions but healing items I have heard of or seen:

Actually, my friend Jason got a scroll of some sorts in the CoM that
had a group heal on it fer 300 hp er so, right click 3-5 charges or
something. I did however see some bad boy rogue in seru the other day
killing guards and he had some item that allowed him to heal himself
after each group of guards. I forgot to send him a tell though and ask
about it. I was just passing threw and just thought it was odd that he
kept casting it like 10+ times and it seemed to be non expendable. If
anyone knows what he could be useing please let me know.

I was also told that gnomes can make a light healing, healing or so
kinda healing machine with like 10 charges but you have to get a class
7 mana battery to recharge it (kinda like the shrink machines). I am
not sure about this item at all though because I have no tinkerer or
anything, just word of mouth, no verification. If you have info on
this, it may be nice to know fer soloers :)

Personally a nice ikky or fungi would be better then any potion you
could get. Just slap it on when in downtime for the effects.
