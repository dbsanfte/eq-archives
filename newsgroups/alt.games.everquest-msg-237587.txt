Okay, so quite an interesting discussion (to me, at least) is going on
in another thread regarding whether or not God exists and what
characteristics he possesses.

There didn't seem to be a good place to inject this comment, so I've
started a new thread.  This message is intended to explain one of the
fundamental reasons I tend to believe in God, which astute readers will
probably rightfully analyze as 'wishful thinking'.

In a nutshell, I want free will.  I don't like the idea that we're all
just mindless automatons bouncing around in a universe, following the
laws of nature without any real, true, underlying choice in the matter.

I think only God can grant free will -- an agent that lives outside the
laws of the universe as we know them -- something well beyond our ability
to comprehend due to the limited nature of our intellect.  If God doesn't
exist, then free will doesn't exist, which means the fact that I'd post
this message, word for word, keystroke for keystroke, eyeblink for eyeblink,
tired due to insomnia, was fated since the beginning of time, unavoidable,
and every semblence of me thinking I have a personal choice in the matter
is nothing more than an illusion.

At an emotional level, I can't accept that.  For me at least, it leads to
the conclusion that the universe is ultimately meaningless, and to apply
meaning to anything is just a localized acceptance of the illusion, almost
a psychiatric disorder to accept unreality as reality, the unreality being
that you actually do have a choice in the matter, and you're not a mindless
automaton.

Okay, I babbled enough, hope this makes sense.  Belief in free will, which
is akin to belief in magic, can only be accompanied by belief in God, the
only agent capable of granting free will.  That is another reason I believe
in God, a purely selfish reason, and perhaps an emotional crutch, but no
more crutch I think, than atheists who accept the illusion of free will and
insist that's no problem.
