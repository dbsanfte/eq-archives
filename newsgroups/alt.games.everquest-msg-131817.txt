Ouch.

I survived my self-root with the two Drolvargs (heals always seem to
channel pretty well and the root broke early).  But the time I was
getting used to a new spell loadout, got disoriented by a lag spike,
and rooted myself next to a Drachnid and in the wander path of two
more didn't go so well... they rooted me (twice) after my root broke
and, well, with three blue mobs beating on me while I'm poisoned my
life expectancy begins to resemble that of a machine-gun team in a
firefight.
