Seconded. I've started three dark elves in Nektulos and it's not so bad.
The newbie log is relatively safe and the wolves and moss snakes are nice
easy kills up to level 3. Sure, you quickly learn what `social mob' means
but that's a good lesson anyway.

But Toxx, oh my god that's awful. 20 steps away from the newbie guards
and you can't even see them anymore. The environment is dark, foggy,
hilly and contains lots of identical tree's so you can get ambushed
easily. Add in wandering reds (Kobolds, Poachers, skeletons) right near
the newbie area and it can turn fatal real quick. Plus the guards won't
help you with poachers.

Add in that the prey is very sparse, poor, hard to see and the
zone is generally empty. And heck, most of the erudites are spell
casters who are fragile enough at low levels.

The only good thing is the boat to Queynos is close and relatively
short duration.
