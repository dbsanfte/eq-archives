East Commons the other day I'm sitting around auctioning for something.  
I was low on mana because I'd just a) helped a lower-level get his corpse 
back in Oasis and responded to several /yells on the way in and back and 
b) sat at the West Freeport gate and handed out binds and sows till my 
breeze and mana ran out.  I'm switching between meditating, checking my 
inventory and my experience and my skills, and reading from a list of 
notes next to me on tailoring:

him: 'Can you sow?'
me: (checking his level) 'yes - 1P'
him: 'Lil hard died - oh well shows how stupid people ar '
me: (not understanding half of his reply but getting the idea he's not 
the type of person I'm into helping) 'uh - what?'
him: 'If you didnt notice i was NAKED then you have problems'
me: 'considering I haven't SEEN you yet, you're not too bright yourself.'
him: 'I was standin in front of you while you were STANDING up so dont 
try that'

...

Remember, this was in the *East Commons tunnel*, where it's hard enough 
finding someone when you're LOOKING FOR THEM TO BEGIN WITH.  I told him I 
didn't look at every idiot to cross my path and he didn't reply but... 
sheesh.  I still don't understand why he looked at me, then *walked out 
of my sight*, *then* asked for the SoW. 

/em shakes her head in confusion

Oh, and there was someone who asked awhile ago what, say, monks were 
supposed to offer in return for SoW - I've been SoWing most monks I've 
noticed lately - does that help? :)
