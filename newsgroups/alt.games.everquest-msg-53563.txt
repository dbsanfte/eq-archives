The Elemental Maelstrom is a uncommon drop of Shardwurms in GD and a common
one in the higher level dungeons on velious. I got mine after 2 hours of
wurm hunting in GD so it's really not that hard to get it yourself.

Shard of the Core and MSII are a lot more uncommon. Never even saw a /auc
for Shard, but MSII often pops up in EC.
