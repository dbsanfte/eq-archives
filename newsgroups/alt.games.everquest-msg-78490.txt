What's your dex before any goodie adjsutments?  As long as it's 75 or above,
I would't worry much about it.  At your level, I'd go with Cutthroat Dervish
Rings, as much for the 1 AC as for the +2  Dex.

On my Barbarian Warrior, his main concern dexterity-wise is trying to get
his archery up.  Because his base dx is only 70, he gets penalized on
skill-ups in missile weapons.

Oh, and as far as mask items... go get a couple mammoth meats from
Everfrost, then head down to Velious to do the quest for the Cougarskin
mask.... stop at the gnome pirate outpost to buy one of the whatever-quality
cougarskin it is that you need (usually can find one at the vendors), then
do the quest for the mask with the snow gnolls.... it's decent dex item, and
AC 6.  As long as something doesn't get you on your way to the snow gnolls,
it's a very, very, easy quest.
