Well it's true I won't rez him again.  He doesn't have a great rep, and has
never been a friend of mine.. and one less person to rez him when his fat
ass takes one of his 10 daily 10k falls will maybe teach him a lil lesson.

I warned him while he was ksing one of my spiders with his group that he
knew it wasn't in his best interests "huh? i didn't pull. im just killing my
groups spiders..."  no dumbass, you see my bitching in /say cuz your pos
bard keeps ganking my spiders.  If he really believed that, he must have
thought his bard was super man.. not only continous pulling, but getting the
mob to 10/15% hp before taking it back to the group too...
