I will be leading a couple of raids for learning pourposes, but still want
to go after some loot for the level's.  I want to teach mob placement, and
pull techniques, so the area has to have a safe room that I can sett up in.
I was thinking of the checkerboard room, LVL 2 in Dalnir for later, after I
have instilled good raid tech in my fellow raiders, as this is a 35 -35
area.  What I need to know is where to take a group of LVL 15 - 25 with a
couple of 35+ for backup, that I can still get loot that will entice my
members into showing up for the raid.

As always I look forward to your idea's.
