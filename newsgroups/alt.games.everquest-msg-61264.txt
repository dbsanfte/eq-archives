you can get your CPU info out of DXDiag, your ram, and right click on My
Computer, go to properties, then the Performance tab, that also says your
ram there.. but go to Device manager. that tells you about every device on
your system, and you should be able to get your videos memory level by going
to its properties (under display adapters), then Details. Good luck
upgrading...
