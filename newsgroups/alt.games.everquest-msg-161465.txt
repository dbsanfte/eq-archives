Heh, watch the accounting more carefully.  Why is the deficit there?
Because Bush isn't playing the shell game with the budget, we're seeing
things as they are.  Clinton's "surplus" was bullshit.  As far as your
little education snipe, Texas has gone from 49'th in the nation up to 40th
(actually, not too sure on how much it climbed, but climb it did).  Sure,
40th may not be that good, but you have to take time to get the products of
the previous administration up to where they need to be.  Of course, if
you're looking for an excuse to bash Bush, little things like that really
don't matter.
