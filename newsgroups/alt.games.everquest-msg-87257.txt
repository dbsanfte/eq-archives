High-dmg piercers *will* give you beautifully high backstabs, *but* you've
got to bear in mind that (I'm making up combos of #s) a 14/40 weapon will
give huge backstabs but that 40 delay would rob you of a LOT of regular
attacks.  Balance =)

Enjoy the soloing while you can.  Soloable mobs later on are extremely rare
and usually only for those who are twinked up with regen equipment, etc.  I
had enough groups where I'd do the odd bits of tanking to keep my defense
going pretty well, and then spent most of 40 soloing to max it up totally.
We aren't tanks, but it *is* worth keeping defenses maxed up (less dmg later
on)
