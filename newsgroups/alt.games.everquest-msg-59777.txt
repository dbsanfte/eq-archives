Ok,

Someone that plays once a week is playing REGULARLY, albeit once a
week. If there are other people who play at the same time, they could
group regularly and might even call themselves a guild, or be part of
a larger guild.

Its not that unlikely a situation, given the large population of
gamers in EQ, some of whom may only play once a week.

Thanks,
LF
