Just hand her the ring.

I recall at one time there were supposed to be some kind of faction hits
involved with the squad ring. Could be lowered faction only on getting it
rather then recharging it. Just recharged one an no faction changes.

As relatively worthless as they are, mine actually saved my druids life the
other day. One in a million shot. Got mobbed, beat feet, hit from behind
with a spell that knocked him unconcious. Apparently I was so far away from
the mobs when the spell hit, I was outside of their aggressive range. Soon
as I revived and stood up, hit the ring for what could have been maybe 15
hit points from the looks of my health bar. Back in the saddle again! Ran to
zone with a half dozen baddies in close pursuit.
