    It was my understanding that AC1, and many other "skill tree" systems,
have abilities raised only by spending level-dependent skill points. That's
not what I want at all, as it leads to "optimal templates" and what not.
What I'd like to see is more like the EQ system, where skills raise as you
use them, and skill caps are level-dependent. So if you want to Mend
reliably, you strip down to leather armour and Mend. Put a few restrictions
on when skills can raise, similar to the restrictions on weapon skills in EQ
(not on a hate list? can't Mend for skill), and depending on the skillup
rate you can have players making serious choices at every level as to how
they play the game.

    As another poster said, that doesn't really change what you can do by
much. Either way you're still banging away at the mob with weapons, you
still have the same spells/abilities available, and unless your gear is very
odd your tanking ability will still be roughly the same.

    Most systems I've seen where optimal paths exist involve games where
players become locked into a progression path (skill point allocation), and
where soloing is viable. I propose neither.
