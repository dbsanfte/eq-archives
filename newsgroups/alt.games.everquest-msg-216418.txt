   Naw.  I often use poorly chosen words, and regret it later.  But I
didn't want to see this turn into a "us versus them" discussion where I
was on a different side from everyone who plays and likes EQ-L.  

    I can understand the reasons others are skeptical about the quality
of EQII, or wouldn't want to play it for other reasons.  EQ-L is still a
dynamic and evolving game.  I just think that EQ-L will bear looking at.
