I'd guess that the lvl 56 part has a lot to do with that. Judging from
some experience at lower leves with alts, (tegular) LDoN becomes a lot
easier at 65 and people tend not to worry as much about Crowd Control.
Handling a 4 or 5 pull without an enchanter or cleric isn't hard at
that level. 

Rgds, Frank.
