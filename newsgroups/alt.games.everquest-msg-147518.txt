Just to be sure to clear this up here.  Serverwide channels are accessible
from all EQ servers, so, a serverwide Taxi channel would be pretty useless.
Regular chat channels are accessible only on your server, and most servers
have some type of taxi channel.  Usually the password is the same as the
channel name.  On E Marr, it is taxi:taxi.  Some servers don't have one at
all, and some have a different name for it.
