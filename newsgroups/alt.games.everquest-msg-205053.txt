level 46   for "real" epic  they are coded the same as old world planes  my
ranger was epiced at 46.

as for paladins  i saw a lvl 6  with a Soulfire , the first of theyre 3 epic
swords. they can do this because  the items to turn in are droppable so they
have the baby pally run arouns get the notes then give them the droppable
part and viola , soulfire ala carte
