Actually, as a shadowknight you can simply give up AC for resist.

Resists are needed primarily for dragons - who use AE breath weapons.
While their melee attacks are formidable, the melee damage a dragon on
one person is *far* outweighed by the potential havoc a powerful breath
weapon can wreak on *everyone* at once.

Besides, on any ubermob you should be using single tank tactics if
possible - and warriors do that, not shadowknights or paladins.  So
unless you're the main tank, AC should be irrelevant.  If we're talking
about dragons like Vox or Naggy, their melee attack is pretty weak
anyway, and a few points of AC makes little difference, but a few
points of the right resistances makes a lot of difference.

Planar armour has some OK resists (usually one resist per piece), but
player-made jewellery is by far the easiest to obtain, assuming you
have the money.
