Any class can be played in a boring, mind numbing, less than useful
fashion. Wizards too. If you wizard in a dungeon group is only sitting
and nuking at half, then it's less than they could do. (Though the
damage and fight stopping ability are nice.)

Depends on the area, though. Remember that our snare is an AoE and in
some cases this can be a Very Bad Thing (TM). he he. But yes, helping
with snare duty is a big plus where appropriate.

Root (or in my case, Enstill) is in the first slot of my spell gems. Has
been since the day I got it. Still is today. Whether grouping, duoing,
or solo quadding, I always wind up using root. For instance, when I'm
rounding up a quad of ulthorks, I'll often aggro a fifth one, or a
walrus or something. Not time to panic. I run my herd *well* away from
my quadding area, target the unwanted add in 3rd person view, get ahead
of them and root it. Enstill is horrible for root nuking because it
seems to break so easily when the mobs hit, but it lasts forever if the
mob is left undisturbed. I then turn and run my remaining flock back to
my normal quadding area where I snare and proceed as usual. Even when
enstill breaks, I'm past the mobs "aw, fuck it" range, so it stays away.
This often involves camping after the quad, however, to clear the aggro
he's now shared with every other mob on the plains.

If in a duo with my necro partner I will run by her and root the add in
front of her and continue away with my quad. She can easily gain aggro
on the add and get the pet on it. The necro can solo most any single
mob, and I just do the quad as per normal.

In dungeon groups I'll usually nuke aggro an add, run it off a short
distance, root it, and go back to the group.

Tishan's clash. We get it early and keep it memmed for all dungeon
activities with groups, though I find it of little use in outdoor
solo/quadding engagements, so rarely have it memmed then. There's more
stuns, but that's a nice, low level, fast casting one that also does
some DD at the same time.

Actually you covered most of them. The rest of the ones I use are more
situation specific things, or stuff to do for people in non-hunting
situations. (Identify, bind, etc.) Your point about comparing to the
monk is well taken, though.  The necro and I have given up trying to
find a group tactic where we both work on the same mob, or try to have
both of us hitting a quad. The results are uniformly bad to disastrous.
So now we group up on one spot, I pull quads and time it so I drop the
kills in front of her so she shares the xp, and she single pulls one
after another, killing them in front of me while I med. I'd estimate
that I can so a few more mobs per time period than her, but not that
many. It's a good system which has been working for us.

And yes, I long since concluded that the OP really doesn't play his/her
wizard very effectively or to their full potential if they see them as
that broken. Our guild is busting ass to try to level up more wizards
into the high fifties/sixty, and actively recruiting to get more. Our
goal is to eventually have a MB burn down team in place, but a pack of
wizards on *any* raid, even where Manaburn isn't an issue, can be a Very
Good Thing (TM) and they kick ass solo or in xp groups as well.
