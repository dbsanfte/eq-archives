Warrior is heavily dependant on gear, and heavily dependant on groups, both 
of which are going to be tough for you.
Id consider trying a different class... something that can solo and doesnt 
need good gear.

Later if you decide you like the game and want to get more expansions, they 
a warior then maybe.

Classes I would suggest are... Beastlord/Druid/necro. (druid is probably the 
easiest)

A good quick way to make money early on is the bard mail quest.
Talk to ton twostring in the freeport bard guild (west end of north 
freeport).
Run the mail to and fro between freeport and kelethin. use the POK books of 
course.
You should be able to get a druid outfitted in leather in an hour or so.

Normally I wouldnt recommend the newbie armor quests, as farming platinum 
and buying in bazaar is quicker.... however without the bazaar... shrug.
Maybe you could ask a friend to go shopping for you?
If you post what server your on, you may get help here.
