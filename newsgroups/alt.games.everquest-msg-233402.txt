dot = Peridot (in this case) a reagent used up when casting
Temperance/Aegolism/Virtue (among many others)

DoT = Damage over Time in other situations  That's a spell that
takes from 18seconds to 2 minutes to do its full damage.

Ext KEI is Extended Koadics Endless Intellect.

KEI is a level 60 spell that boosts mana regen by 14 per tick,
int and wis by 25 and mana pool by 250.  Base duration is
2.5 hours.  With spell casting reinforcemnt it gets longer:

SCR 1 (5%)  = 2 hours, 37.5 minutes
SCR 2 (15%) = 2 hours, 52.5 minutes
SCR 3 (30%) = 3 hours, 15 minutes
SCR Mastery (50%) = 3 hours, 45 minutes

Add in a buff extender focus like the mage summoned mantle (15%) and
it goes to 4 hours, 7.5 minutes

If they have the 8th shawl (20%) it hits its max at 4 and 13 minutes.
