While I agree that you can't "camp" something remotely, VI does not
recognize "camp" claims. So, if you had been sitting in a camp 4 hours
waiting on a spawn, or sitting in frenzy killing spawns, and someone else
comes along and wants to "share" the camp you must share (according to the
PnP rules). That one little lame rule is how VI has relieved GM's of the
burden of deciding who is in the right and being accused of playing
favorites. While it is a lame rule, it is also a written rule by the people
who run this game and can ban you from playing it.
Each server has its own set of "unwritten rules", but they are not
enforceable by the players or recognized by VI. One of those rules that
applies to a large number of servers is that Hadden is FFA, along with the
SRO AC. They will be and are, KSed each and every day. If you are KSed at
one of those places and petition, you will most likely get the prize you
were there for, but at the expense of possibly being "blackballed" by a
large number of guilds on your server (the only way of enforcing player
rules).

That being said, I would suggest you ask around your server's message boards
and find out what camps are considered FFA and be prepared to deal with the
situation in those camps.
