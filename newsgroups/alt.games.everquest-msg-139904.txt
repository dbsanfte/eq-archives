just ask, and they'll tell you

then talk with the other shamans, and they'll say things like, "oh, i can
click that spell, so don't waste your mana . . try to land a <other spell>"
or something close

you're only tagging along so they can see you aren't an idiot that's going
to beg for loot, or try to solo stuff and end up causing some deaths

you are obviously concerned enough about being a positive addition, and
that's the most important step
