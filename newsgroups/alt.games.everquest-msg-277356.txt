The long and short of it is that Lanys T'Vyl has taken over the outpost of Firiona Vie.
This occurred in the weeks prior to the release of the Dragons of Norrath expansion pack.

The culmination of the script was quite an event, with Lanys leading the dark races across
the Dreadlands to battle Al Kabor and an army of light.  Players on both sides assisted,
but in the end, darkness seized the day.

The light-race inhabitants fled the outpost, booted the Drolvargs out of the Wulfwere
village on the eastern edge of the zone, and took up residence therein.  All of the of the
light-race quest mobs and merchants can be found there.

Best regards,
