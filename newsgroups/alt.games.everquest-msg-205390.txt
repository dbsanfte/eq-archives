Hey! Be nice. :-p

Actually, you aren't far off at the moment as the software is just
starting to become available. It was very strange to be playing last
night and see only 18 players on the whole server. I expect that this
will pick up very quickly as EverQuest makes its way into stores. It
just shipped on Monday and the only stores that I know that have it on
the shelves yet are the Apple Stores and Fry's. Other places are
expecting it in during the next few days.

Hopefully it will retain the friendly atmosphere that it had during the
beta.
