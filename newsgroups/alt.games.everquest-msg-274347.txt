I know enough to say that you're a dishonest person. You gave your
word you wouldn't sell your account when you installed the software,
when you created your account, and every single time you logged in.
Now you're breaking your word. That makes you a dishonest person. In
case you're too thick to grasp the concept, a dishonest person is
someone who breaks their word.
