Yes it can be used, I have one but don't.
I remember someone saying that they did use one in here, not sure if they
are still posting or lurking tho'
I often 3 Box so there is no room on my desk for this (2 keyboards and one
laptop) and I can't replace a keyboard with it as I talk to friends too
often to lose a keyboard.
I bought it for Q3 but went back to using the Keyboard in the end, it is
comfortable but the 10 keys just aren't enough for team chat commands as
well.
Can't think of anyway that you could be banned for this in EQ. I doubt you
could program this to do anything more than a Hotkey "macro" in EQ already
could.
