I can't decide whether to invest more time in a character with a name
I loathe, or live with the pain of waiting for a petition to be
answered.  I heard a rumour that a GM was spotted on AB about 6 months
ago, but I'm not sure I believe it.

Oh yes, I know what it means - it simply didn't click that it could be
a title used in the game.  I've almost certainly encountered an NPC
called Squire Whatever in the game as well, but it didn't click in
those few seconds between having my previous 50 attempts at a name
rejected and then thinking of Squire.  It's also used as a surname of
course, which was what I was thinking of at the time (my two other
bards are named after musicians, and me and one of the other guys this
char will be grouped with are bass players - so Chris Squire came to
mind).
