Quoted from Ben Sisson (I think...)
Give Warriors best taunt in the game, and have it be very, very
reliable.
Give them best AC in the game.
Keep damage as is, or with minor increase.
Do that at *all* levels, not just 50+.

This just seems logical to me.  I don't play my warrior because I want a bunch
of *tactics* to work on.  I play my warrior when I want to *maim, destroy,
kill*.
