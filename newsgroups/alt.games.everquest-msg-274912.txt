I've noticed that a lot of people in EQ2 seem to be in a sprint to get to 
level 50.  This I don't quite understand.  With armor and weapons have their 
own levels and lower in power as characters level past them, it doesn't make 
much sense to zoom past so much content just to become level 50.  This game 
is designed well enough that there is plenty of interesting and challenging 
things to do at all levels starting on the Isle of Refuge and progressing 
upwards from there.  To each his own I guess.  I'm taking the slow, scenic 
route with pauses along the way to kill the wildlife.
