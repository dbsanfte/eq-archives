Some of you may remember that I recently started to play EQ (about 1 month
now), and have been able to team up with someone to get me to lvl 25 mage.
I've found that the Paludal Caverns are rich with exp, but it has let to a
question on camping.

I was soloing camp2 and was about 2 or 3 kills away from dinging 25 when
another mage came up to me and asked if he could camp there with me.  I said
sure (even asked him his lvl -- thought we could team up, but he was lvl
17), and even gave his pet a weapon just to be nice.  Well, I'm sitting
there medding and about to go pull a bandit for myself when 3 of this guy's
friends show up and start taking all the kills.  Finally, I asked him to let
me have enough to get my lvl (which he was kind enough to agree to, but his
group went on killing, so I went up the hill and found enough to get my lvl
and then logged).

So, (getting to the point) -- I have to say that I'm totally against
claiming a camp for one's own (in a situation like this -- I'm sure it's
different when you're killing higher lvl's, but these guys spawn very
quickly, so there's enough to share), but who has the rights here?  I know
I'm soloing, but I was there first.  I have no problem sharing, but I'm not
there just to sit and watch other people kill.  Anyone know any good way to
handle that?

Then again, maybe I just needed to rant ....
