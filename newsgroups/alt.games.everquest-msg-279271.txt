	Why can't it be hell? Haven't I already explained that single groupers 
will (do) put themselves through hell to get their crap upgrades?

	I can't think of anything to describe my 40 or so 'easy' tak missions 
(all of them bleeding collects or slaughters of course) to obtain my 
current breastplate, if not 'hell'. Or what to call grinding 60 creators 
for my next set upgrades if not 'hell'. God - doing 60 identical 
missions for third rate gear wahoo. But I do it anyway because it's... 
upgrades.

	(why do I do only creators? ask the hundred maniacs I've grouped 
with... I can't figure it out. But then, I haven't SEEN other missions 
to know why creator is so preferable)

	The last time I remember truly enjoying getting upgrades was Veksar. 7 
upgrades from about 5 camps, incredibly cool 3D zone full of undead and 
golems. Why can't they make more content like that :)

	Don't get me wrong, I wholly appreciate the fact that DoN and LDoN are 
in the game. Without them, I would have played my ass off for 2,400 
hours for even *worse* gear :P

	A couple of things:

1. I don't know anything about playing with a monk, but as a plate tank 
889 AC unbuffed would have me smashed flat in a few rounds regardless of 
HP in MPG, let alone RSS. Were you planning to tank with this guy? If 
not, what do you need all that HP for anyway?

2. Most of that gear DROPS in RSS. So essentially, you're proposing to 
_somehow_ get groups with sub RSS gear in order to get RSS gear. Once 
again, I don't know anything about playing a monk, so this could be 
possible. It is impossible or at least highly improbable as a 
shadowknight, unless you've got insane friends who'll try anything (as I 
used to have, see: tanking hard ldon's with mostly veksar gear).

	So I guess I'm saying that what you're proposing is indeed possible, 
but strikes me as massively improbable, and is quite possibly a lot more 
probable for a monk than my own class. Basically, your uber one group 
monk is probably going to spend a lot of his time hiding behind a tank 
with dramatically better gear. Tough luck to the crap tanks I suppose - 
oh there I go whining about class balance (Tank vs non-tank this time) 
again :)

	I use the automatic synch feature these days. Wouldn't help you much 
with your theoretical monk though...

	In my case its because I try to limit my comments to what I know (or at 
least have some idea of), so I have previously refrained from declaring 
an imbalance between  raid and non raid gear because I haven't seen what 
it takes to get raid gear. Was it worse before? I don't know, I've only 
been at the level cap in this game for the last 18 months or so. But if 
it was worse before so what? If it's imbalanced now it should be fixed 
now, what has the past got to do with it?

There are

	If I may paraphrase you somewhat: The majority of the players (the 
majority of players are pre-elemental) need to suffer with crap gear in 
order to support the minority of uberguild raiders' raiding habit by 
bribing loot whores? Glad we've got THAT straight. Of course I agree 
completely!

cheers,
James
