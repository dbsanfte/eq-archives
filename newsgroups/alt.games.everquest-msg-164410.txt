Oh good, you're on a server where everyone's stupid enough to think the drop
rate wasn't nerfed.  No one was in HoH until about 2 days before the drop
rate nerf, so there's only about 100 windblades on my server, and they sell
for 60k or more.

I'm not sure how you make money, but 60k isn't a trivial amount for most
people.

Besides, it's a hypothetical situation, in which the warrior and monk have
EQUIVALENT WEAPONS.  There's no logic in saying that the warrior puts out
more dps because he has a better weapon.
