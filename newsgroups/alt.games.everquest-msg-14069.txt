In the case of someone buying someone else's account, both people are in
violation of the EULA and neither should get the account. In the case of a
hacked account, all Verant needs to do is check the credit card number to
see who's been paying for the account prior to it being stolen. Only the
original owner of the account will be listed as the card owner.
