I think the mmog community has seen enough monstrously bungled releases 
that if Blizzard delays longer and has the smoothest launch to date it 
will count in they're favour much moreso than getting out earlier.

Nothing hurts a MMOG more than 4000 reviews that conclude: come check 
this title again in 6 months to a year when its ready... 6 months to a 
year later there is no longer the launch press/media frenzy... will the 
public eye and the crowds really return 6 months later when its fixed? 
To play a title they've seen gathering dust on store shelves for those 6 
months? I doubt it.

I think getting it right at launch is going to count more than getting 
to launch first.
