People sell old movies, people sell old video games of all types, people
sell old playstations, old nintendos, old records, old tapes...  Hell,
people sell just about anything that they *bought* and nobody thinks
anything of it.

The most questionable legality is the EULA.  As a matter of common law (and
common sense) anything I can buy I can turn around and sell.
