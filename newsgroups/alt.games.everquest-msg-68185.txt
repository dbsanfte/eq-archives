  No, I have been watching the prices pretty closely over the past
couple months, as I have been planning on building a computer with DDR
memory soon myself, and a month or so ago, PC2100 256 mb sticks were
selling for about $38 from Crucial (sometimes with free shipping to
boot).  Actually, I just checked, and according to sharkyextreme.com,
on November 15th, Crucial was selling them for a mere $31
(http://www.sharkyextreme.com/guides/WMPG/article.php/10706_924781__2)
.

  Yeah, there's that too.
