There are a few ways you can keep your weight down. 
First one is by upgrading your armour to cured silk which weighs .1 a piece, not
to mention it looks a hell of a lot better than the raw silk robe, though you'll
either have to make it yourself or buy it from another player. 
Some weight reduction sacks are handy as is baked food which is lighter than
most other foods.
When looting try to loot things that stack, eg spider silks, bone chips, venom
glands, etc. These will never weigh more than a single of said item. If you do
loot a large item then skip on over to the nearest available merchant and sell
it ASAP. HTH. :)
