    I don't think he's saying that they run random inspections, more that
people get inspected by accident all the time and it'll eventually get
noticed.

    I'm the only person that knows how to log on my account. Not even my
best friend of 17 years, an EQ player, knows my password. Any guild where
giving out account info is mandatory is a guild you should pass on, because
there's no legitimate reason for account info to be gathered like that.
