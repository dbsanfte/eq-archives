False.  Any of the clarity line works whether standing or sitting.  You 
will only get the additional bonus of your meditation skill while 
sitting, or on a horse (and not moving or attacking).

For the best mana regen, get a mount (horse or drogmor), canni all you 
want, no need to time it, and stack on as many of the mana regen buffs as 
you can get, and get as much flowing thought as you can.

Again, the only part of mana regen affected by sitting is your meditation 
skill portion.  Cannibalize, mana regen buffs, flowing thought are all 
unaffected by sitting or standing.
