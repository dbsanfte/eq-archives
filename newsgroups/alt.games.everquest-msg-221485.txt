My erudite necro never seemed KOS in erudin, but was in qeynos.  all
you had to do was swim to the sewer entrance and go through the sewers
to the fron of qeynos, and you bound there.  I was apprehensive to the
bloodsabers.

My worst problem with evil characters was trying to get an Inkie
cleric through HHK.  The gnolls hate you, the orcs hate you, and the
citizens hate you.  You could take the southern route, but it was
lOOOOOOOng.  My best bet was always to wait at the entrance and beg an
invis from a druid or enchie.

I still remember SKs and necros begging food from group members
because it was too time consuming to run back to the one city that
would sell to you.
