Just how hard is the wizard epic?   The reason I ask is that
one of our regular groups is a 53 wizard, his wife, a 53 ranger,
my RL buddy, 55 ranger, me 54 mage, and a 55 druid.  When I
finally hit 56 and get MR2, if the wizard has his epic I'll be able
to mana pump him like no tomorrow.  At that point MR2's are 
going to be far more efficient than me nuking.
