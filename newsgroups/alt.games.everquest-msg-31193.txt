Just some info you didn't ask for but may want to consider. Probably every
class can solo to ~20. The only thing that is different is how hard it is to
get there, how much time it takes a normal human being, and how much fun you
are having along the way.

I looked at the time it took for my characters to get to 20. I think it
varied from about 10 to 24 days with the 24 days being a multiple craft
person and the just under 10 days being a solo druid. I screw around a lot,
questing and things, probably could do it in much less time if I didn't get
distracted. Much discussion lately about power leveling characters and it
seems like no matter what you would be lucky to get it done in ~24 hours of
play.

So you got 8 slots, figure it takes 10 days on average to level 20, you get
80 days of playing before you even have to group.  That's a lot of playing
time to decide if you like the character. Play 5 hours a night, that works
out to just over a year of play.

The characters I like running the most are Magician, Druid, Ranger. The
character I like running solo least is my Shaman. I'm of the op Shaman is a
word that when translated into english means "Just a cleric by any other
name that has trouble soloing".

What you should consider is: Druids don't really come alive until level 14.
Rangers don't really cut it until 9<ditto for Shadow Knights and Paladins.
Deleted my SK>. Necros and Shaman because of their starting locations and
factions are considered making an advanced/difficult play. Shaman don't come
alive until level 9 when they get SoW. Necro's pets don't even start hitting
with magical attacks until level 12 and even then the performance is spotty.

That leaves you with a Magician if this is going to be your second
character, as most fun out of the box and the one you can stick with for a
long time. IMHO: Save the necro for your 4th or 5th character after you have
the lay of the land.

Magician is almost idiot proof, survived me anyway. Didn't follow any of the
conventional wisdom about "Use a race with 130-135 int Gnome or Erudin."
Just got a human out of Freeport and ran with it. Qeynos would have worked
out just as well and after hunting Butcher Block/GFay with my other
characters I am sure I could have even been happy with a Gnome or High Elf.
