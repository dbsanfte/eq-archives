I'm sure all the thousands of people on whose work the current estimate for 
the age of the Earth is based really appreciate you calling it "best 
guesses". Let's put forward a little bit of evidence from wildly different 
fields of knowledge:

For an old Earth:

-Geology: Continents move, but slowly... It's possible to work out the rate 
of continental drift, and from there, how long it took previously joined 
landmasses to reach their current positions. Hint, it's a lot more than 
10.000. It's more like *billions* of years.

-Chemistry/Physics: There are a lot more dating methods than just Carbon 14, 
that can be applied to rocks, and more are being discovered every year... 
Most of them are based on the decay of radioactive elements, and thus dates 
can be extrapolated from those elements half-lives. Again, while they can't 
be extremely precise, they can at least land you within a few tens of 
millions of years of the correct time. Again, there is a lot of stuff that 
was going on billions of years ago, rather than 10.000.

-Astronomy/Physics: Stellar mechanics are pretty well sorted out by now 
(again, not perfect, but good to within a few hundreds of millions of 
years). From the age of the Sun it's possible to extrapolate the time at 
which planets condensed from the accretion disk that gave origin to the 
whole Solar System. Again, the results give the Earth an estimated age of 
around four point five billion years.

-Biology: Mutation rates of the DNA of different organisms can be 
calculated, and so biologists can work out when different species split from 
a common ancestor (in fact genetics gives a lot more good evidence of 
evolution than the fossil record). Of course, there are no species left over 
from the very origin of the Earth, and no DNA to be tested from fossils, but 
for non-extint species, their evolution can be tracked over *millions* of 
years, not thousands.

-Archaeology/Anthropology: There is a lot of stuff around that's much older 
than 10.000 years. In fact, Australian Aboriginal culture can be traced a 
lot further back than that.

Against an old Earth:

The compiled mythology of a nomadic tribe of the Middle East.

Now, you can accuse me of complacency, but I think I'll side with Science on 
this one.
