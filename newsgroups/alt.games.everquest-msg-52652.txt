    No, these items all predate last patch. I'm betting they have to do with
Primordial Malice, the Lanys T'Vyl cult that has a base in Rathe Mtns. The
first quest for them is as yet unsolved (as it's broken), so it makes more
sense that these items are for later installments of quests from them. Send
it in to Ester!
