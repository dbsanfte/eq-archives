Please don't take this as written in stone, but I believe all the regular
velium weapons proc at level 25. I own a velium staff and it started procing
like crazy against green mobs and occasionally against blues as soon as I
hit 25 yesterday. It has done nothing except give the non sufficient will
message before then.
