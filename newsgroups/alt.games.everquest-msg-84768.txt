Any of mine...  =) I'll put up screenshots one of these days, but suffice 
to say I picked Han's robe to match the color of his eyes. It's just a 
shame Druids are so limited in their choice of gear.

Now, I just wish I could raid PoA and get a set of gloves that matches 
the Golden Efreeti Boots (and hell, I wish the GEBs looked golden on 
humans, rather than mustard. Bah).
