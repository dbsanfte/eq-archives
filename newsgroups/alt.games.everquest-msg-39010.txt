Haven't seen this mentioned here yet, just wondering if

ACCOUNT SECURITY POLICY UPDATED

Following the player claims for Brad McQuaid's allegedly 
compromised account (see story here) to be banned in 
accordance with the Sony Online Account Security Policy, 
revisions have been made to make the policy a little 
more friendly.
