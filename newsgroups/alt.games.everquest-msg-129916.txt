It would actually do you much better to wait until you hit the level
with the Trueshot discipline (55? I don't know rangers as
well), and THEN do whatever you want with AA abilities.

My alt rogue hit 51 and then got run 3 and regen 3,
and hasn't done AA since.  Once she hits 55 and gets
double backstabs, I'll look into some of the exp splits
to find something comfortable, but until then you actually
have a better time (better damage, hits, spells, etc) just
by simply leveling up a bit.
