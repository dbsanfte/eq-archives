Exactly.  That was one reason I disliked AO.  There was no feeling of
accomplishment with your equipment, really.  No feeling like you had just
gotten an item that you'd be using for a long time.  And thus, no
sentimental attachment to anything in your inventory.

I can remember how I got every piece of equipment I'm wearing in EQ, and
some of them are some damn good stories.  And I'm reminded of them every
time I open my inventory.  Players work hard for their equipment, and it is
huge sense of pride for a lot of them.

Item decay is not in itself a bad idea.  Really, it isn't.  It just has to
be non-intrusive enough that it won't impede your play sessions, and it
absolutely cannot result in an item being destroyed, ever.  What I disliked
about DAoC was not the repair, but the fact that you could only repair it so
many times.  If I spend a significant amount of time trying to get a
particular item, I don't want to _ever_ lose it permanently.
