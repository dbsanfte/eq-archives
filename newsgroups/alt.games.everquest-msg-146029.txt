I was killing the Allizewsaur with my 54 druid last night and the exp
was considerably better.  It used to take in the neighbor hood of 12
to 15 Alli kills to get one blue bub of exp, last night I got a full
blue bubble after 6 kills.

And FWIW, a real life friend of mine made about 3 1/2 blue last night
playing his SK/Druid two box combo in JPF in about 3 hours last night.
Mostly on the bandits.

You might just want to find some mobs that are a little closer to your
level.
