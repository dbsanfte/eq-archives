You may have seen another phenomena at work.  People who know how the
mechanics of the game work wanting to save themselves some trouble.  See, an
un-aggroed healer will literally *never* run out of mana.  Mobs don't spend
mana until they are aggroed, so often the best thing to do about a healer is
to just go ahead and engage it so that it's at least using up its mana for
the heals.
