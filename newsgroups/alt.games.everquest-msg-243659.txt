The hope is that once things are working *properly* older systems
(assuming they can handle dx9b) will actually get a performance
*boost*, because the new engine is supposed to be less reliant on
system power.

However, like many things Sony claims, implementation may vary from
theory. At the moment I don't blame you for quitting.
