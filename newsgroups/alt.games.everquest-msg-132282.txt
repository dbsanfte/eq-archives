For your armour, you should get yourself a set of banded made by a player.
The going rate on my server when I bought it was 1pp per AC. Can't remember
the total cost for a full set but it would be something like 40pp.

Easy way to get that plat is to charge around crushbone killing all the orc
centurions you can find and looting the crushbone belts. These will sell to
players for 1pp each. Shouldn't take you long to make up the plat as long as
you join the server in an off-peak moment.

As for weapons, you could try and buy a cheap velium weapon from another
player. It wont proc for you at lev 17 but it is a magic item and will let
you hit ghouls etc.
