www.eqtraders.com has a pretty extensive list somewhere on the message
boards.  Basically they drop off a variety of mobs in Tenebrous Mountains,
Scarlet Desert, Grimling Forest, Acrylia Caverns, and I believe Shadeweavers
Thicket.  Could very well be other places, I'm too lazy to go check.  You
can also use smithing to convert blocks of various sizes down to pieces.
