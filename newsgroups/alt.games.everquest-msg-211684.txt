	Quite the reverse...a knight, particularly a Paladin, can hold agro much
better than most Warriors.  This is why Warriors are up in arms.

	Defensive is only a factor in raid tanking.  For experience groups a
knight will outperform a Warrior.

	It sure as hell is.

	It's official: you suck.

	Hitting Taunt every time it lights up is wrong.  You're only supposed to
hit it when you need it.

	That will work on many Rangers, but the knights will just laugh and
happily do your job.  And then people notice that they don't need a Warrior if
they have a knight in the group already and start looking for DPS classes
instead....

|That said, here are the pluses I have seen from the Hybrid classes.  When a

	Outdoors, I can equal or outperform any Monk.

	Indoors, the Monk can pull. :-)
