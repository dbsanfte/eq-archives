Pretty much, but in the same way that Ragefire is triggered.   Use
a key on a door, bribe a guard, etc.   How much trouble does SOE
have with getting Ragefire to consistently spawn when triggered?
So tracking shows it up on track (as controlled by the normal spawn
process) but it respawns when you enter the target area.

Upper and lower limits aren't difficult to implement, so all drops
could be balanced.  And it wouldn't be that difficult to generate
different drop tables.

Cumbersome, maybe.   Can *SOE* do it?   Maybe not.  But it
certainly CAN be done.   I'd add it's probably not worth the
effort, either, at least for EQ.   It'd be nice in EQ2, though.  The
point is that there's no *technical* reason for content developers
to think in strictly linear fashion.
