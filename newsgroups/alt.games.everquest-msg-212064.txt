Best. Necro. Site. Evar.

The info is spotty, but it is a highly amusing read written by a guy that 
obviously loves his class mightily.

From his talk about why he likes Fishing (

Some of my more philosophical friends have questioned my pastime. "Morty," 
they say, "you are a fearsome deliverer of bloodshed and pain, the very 
incarnation of that grim darkness we call mortality." (You can see why I 
keep such friends around.) "Why do you pursue a hobby that even an 
illiterate barbarian can excel in, when you could be spreading unholy 
terror throughout the world?"

"Completeness," I tell them. "It's important to kill the little things, 
too."

kills you both. You'll fight, and you'll shag, and you'll hate each other 
till it makes you quiver, but you'll never be friends. Love isn't brains, 
children, it's blood... blood screaming inside you to work its will. I may 
be love's bitch, but at least I'm man enough to admit it.'
