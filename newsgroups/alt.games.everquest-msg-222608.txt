I respectfully disagree. If that were the case we wouldn't be on our 6th 
expansion.

The 'people in the game' are a crucial aspect of an MMRPG, so much so 
that if you solo your way to 65+400AA and never chat or group your 
missing out just as much as the guy who made level 9 with 800 friends 
but who's never left freeport.

This is true of most (all?) games, and is not unique to EQ. Need for 
Speed does have 'preset advancement conditions', but if you want to run 
the track backwards and smash the other cars you can play that way too.

EQ also has preset advancement conditions, and more ways to get to them, 
(to an extent, pretty much all of them require killing mobs within your 
level range)

Of course. That guy playing NFS backwards may even be having twice as 
much fun as the guy playing it 'properly', so I have no issue with him 
playing it like that, to each their own... but the guy playing it 
backwards is missing out on most the effort the designers put into the game.
