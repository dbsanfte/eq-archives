This is how I was told it was often used (and why it was nerfed)
SK (or Necro) would pull mob from outside aggro range. The mob they have
attacked, by whatever means, will now see them even with invis but any
social adds that aggro just because one of their "mates" has aggro can be
dropped by spamming invis from this item.  Once a mob has actually got aggro
on the player then the invis doesn't make any difference but until that
point they will start to drop off and fall back from the aggro'd mob.
Combined with their FD spells it made separating mobs much easier and them a
bit too useful at pulling for Verant's (at the time) liking.

I have never used one and not seen anyone pull with one so this info is
second hand.

Typically I had the chance to buy the pre nerf one for 200pp while in
EC....but this was Pre Nerf (by about 3 days) and at that time 200pp was a
substantial amount of cash to spend on, what I considered, a toy....Next
patch it was nerfed and the price went thru the roof...So many missed
oppotunities
/sigh
Did I ever tell you about the time I could have bought a Jade Reaver for
500pp?
