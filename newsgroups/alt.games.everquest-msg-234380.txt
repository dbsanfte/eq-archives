}For some reason I thought there was a ceiling of 100.  I figure it
}logical to have a ceiling.  Then when you taunt, you go to the top of
}the list.  But if there's no ceiling, then when you taunt, you go to
}max(hate)+1. 

Yup, that's what happens. :) I don't think it's proven there's no ceiling, 
but I can vouch for it being at least a few thousand or so, and taunt 
definitely only takes you to max hate+1, not the ceiling, or you'd never 
accidentally aggro off the tank after a successful taunt.

}Of course there's other variables that add to hate.  Your level, your
}proximity, your health, sitting, others? 

Those don't actually -add- to hate, they modify it.  Say you have two 
characters, one has worked his hate up to 800, the other 750ish.  Now, we 
don't have any hard numbers for this point, but the further away you are, 
the lower the distance modifier of hate is.  So if the 750ish guy is right 
in the mob's face and the 800 guy is a step or two back, the 750ish guy 
will get whacked at the end of the mob's delay cycle.  But if Mr. 750 
backs up three steps, Mr. 800 gets whacked.  But they'd both still have 
the same accumulated hate.  Think of it as a function running from 0 at 
infinite distance to 2 if you're standing at the same exact /loc as the 
mob. (Note: that 2 came straight out of my butt, it's a wild guess.)  So 
when the mob is choosing who it has aggro on, it goes down the hate list 
and muliplies all the hate values by modifiers for this proximity 
function, for low health (which is probably *3 or so), and for sitting 
(*2?).  Then it goes after whoever's highest.  The generally bad situation 
is if someone a ways away actually gets high enough hate that they get 
aggro, because then the mob will leave the tank, and move toward the 
distant guy with aggro.  This starts lowering the tank's proximity 
modifier, and raising the more distant target's, making it much harder for 
the tank to get aggro back.  On the other hand, that's how you aggro kite. 
:)

}Getting back to the beginning of the thread, I'm not totally clear why
}my cleric was indifferent to mobs in Unrest but my Paladin friend was
}ready-to-attack.  Someone posted that maybe he did something previously
}to adjust faction.  Oh well. 

Doubtful.  I don't think there are any quests or mobs you can kill who 
give or take faction from those mobs.  They certainly don't give a faction 
hit themselves last I checked.  I would be most suspicious of IVU, since 
one of the parties was indiferent, and I've seen it turn out to be 
invis/IVU about a dozen times out of 12 when someone was suprised to be 
indiff. :)

It's -possible- they just don't like paladins or do like clerics, but 
that's almost never the case.  I'd see if you can repeat the experiment.
