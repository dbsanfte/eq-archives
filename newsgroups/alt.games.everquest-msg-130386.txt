My ranger has been gathering bonechips for 2 nights straight. and Priestess
Galea still won't talk to me about soil of underfoot. That's the last piece
I need for my ivy etched boots. Please if anyone knows a better way to raise
factions, tell me. There are basically no more newbies in that zone, so
auction for bonechips got me absolutely nothing, i had to clear the newbie
area myself to get what little bonechips there are there.
