The Radeon 9500 series & 9700 series both support dual display computing &
have the software to make it work properly.  I'll try it out again once I
get my motherboard back from RMA.  I use a Radeon 9700 Pro now and it works
really nice in EQ but is a pain to configure at first.  There is one setting
that really screws up EQ playing just FYI, find it by going to Display
Settings then click the Advanced button, from there go to the
Troubleshooting Tab & there is a little box below that says "Enable Write
Combining" and unless your EQ is running PERFECT in EVERY WAY and I do mean
it, if it's not 100% perfect then uncheck that setting & you should now be
running EQ & many other games 100% Perfectly, asuming you have the proper
drivers installed everywhere else.  That same setting also hurts nVidia GF4
Ti-4xxx owners as well, in gameplay that is, but I dont know about GF3 &
lower cards, or for GF4 MX cards either for that matter.

But I do know for sure that the Radeon 9500 & 9700 series of cards support
Dual Display computing.  I just havn't tried it in EQ yet.  I'm quite
anxious to do so now as I never gave it much thought before.  It would be
nice to just switch screens by a hotkey and surf the web, look at maps,
parse files, you name it, it'd be real fun =0)

I know that most of the GF4-Ti cards support dual display as well, but of
course you need 2 displays.  You can also control what is shown in either
monitor just like you can with the Radeon's.

GL though!
