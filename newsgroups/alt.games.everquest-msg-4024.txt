You're funny.  You put an amazing amount of thought and effort into twisting
my words around and remaking conclusions.

First of all, Mr. Jeweler, if you can spot a Rolex from a knock off from a
cursory glance, then more power to you.  I don't believe that it's
impossible, just not likely.  Especially if the knock of was done well ...
since that is what they are trying to represent.

Get over the real life comparisons?  Pardon me for living in the real world,
but EQ is just a game.  Yes, there are things in the game that will piss me
off.  Just like people who scream at the TV during football season over a
bad call.  In the grand scheme of things does it matter?  No.  But at that
time, yes, when I see the "So-an-so is inspecting your equipment" it does
aggravate me that someone wouldn't use common courtesy and simply ask first.
Considering that I am a real live person and that there are other real live
people behind the characters, I am going to use real life examples.

So, what's my point?  If you don't get it, you MAKE my point.  The
"nyah-nyahnyah-boo-boo I can inspect you and there's nothing you can do
about it" attitude is childish.  Again, I go back to common courtesy.  You
don't Kill Steal, you don't indulge in Trade Fraud, and you don't inspect
without asking.

Lastly, and this is the funny one.  You state that I'm getting pissed of
over something I don't even know is happening, and I tell you AGAIN, that I
have the inspect message OFF so that I DON'T get pissed off.  Jeez.  And yes
I DID answer your question, I thought you might have caught the answer in my
text, but I guess not.  I get pissed off over the lack of common courtesy.
If I bump into someone, I say "excuse me".  When I go to someone's place or
residence, I don't just walk in, I wait to be invited.  If I wish to inspect
someone in EverQuest, I ASK them if it's okay.  If they say no, I respect
their wishes and move along.  If they say yes, I turn my inspect on and take
a look.

We don't have to agree with each other ... and I don't ever presume that we
will.  But to attempt to belittle my comments with rash statements of
"stupidity" is only gunna further exemplify your own ignorance ...
especially when you have to twist my words to get there.  Don't make up your
own answers in what I type, I place them there for you.
