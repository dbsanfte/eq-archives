Sure an explanation would be that this is what I see on a daily basis .

Examples include but are not limited to .
a) The first republican president was Abraham Lincoln.
b) the civil rights act of 1964 was passed by a very small majority. There
was a greater percentage of republicans that voted for it than there was
democrats. Without this it would not have passed (ie republicans forced a
bill making it illegal to discriminate based solely on race)
