Um... no.

In Horizons, once you're above level 10 you get death points instead of
losing your corpse and experience.  Every time you die you get one more
death point, and have to suffer through a "death penalty" of skill and stat
reductions.  The amount and duration of the penalty increase with the number
of death points you had when you died.

At 6 death points, the highest I've gotten (I craft a lot, so I don't often
rack up the death points without allowing them to fade), the death penalty
was a 20% reduction to all stats and skills for 25'ish minutes.    While it
was on, I could barely kill mobs that were 4 levels below my normal targets,
which I had been beating easily.   If I had taken off my sword or armor, I'm
not sure I would have had enough skill to re-equip them.

That was getting up to 6 death points.   Some of the hardcore adventurers
have gotten as high as 25.   I didn't hear what that guy's death penalty
was, only that it sucked.   Judging from my own, I'd have to guess at least
a 50% reduction in all stats / skills, which would last well over an hour.

Death points fade one every 8 hours of real time, or can be removed by
buying expensive ingame cures.

You can always try throwing yourself off a cliff a few times every time you
respawn.    Make it a game, see how many corpses you can get in PoK before
your group rezes you back.
