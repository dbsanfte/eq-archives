Not sure if this is what is happening... but my wife pointed it out to
me first... and then I noticed it on my machine.

I will NOT go LD on zone almost ever, unless I do an Alt-Enter to go
to windows mode.... goof around and then go back to full screen mode.
On the next zone / camp to change characters, ill drop to server
selection.

Just curious if your working in windowed mode?

good luck
