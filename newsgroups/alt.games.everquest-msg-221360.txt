I've only been playing at the "low" end of the game (20-35) lately. But
the pickup groups I've been in mostly seem to have the attitude that only
a cleric will do for healing. If no clerics are around, then a shaman is
marginally acceptable. And under no circumstances can a druid be a main
healer. Maybe 2 druids would work, but certainly not just one.

I even hear this attitude from the (sole) druid in the group.

Now, my druid is only 19, and I thought I did okay in groups, but I've
only grouped with a warrior friend who was ultra-twinked, so healing wasn't
that big a deal. And I had no trouble keeping a group alive with my 30
shaman. So I'm puzzled by this attitude...

Is this a case of druids really can't be main healers? Is it their way of
getting out of healing so they can do all the fun stuff like nuke and ds
and snare? Is it just that the level of healing for ldons requires either
cleric efficiency or shaman mana regen? Enquiring minds would like to know!
