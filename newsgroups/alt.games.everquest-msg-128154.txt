There are other options:

1. You could create a share with on your EQ directory to the internet, 
and put a password on it, then let only the people you want to give 
access to know about it. They can then mount your share then use MapX on 
their machines.

2. You could set up a software firewall on your machine, or a hardware 
firewall between your machine and whatever you use to access the net. 
Then allow access from the machines of the members of your guild, then 
share your EQ log and let them mount it and fire up MapX to see where 
you are.

3. You could set up a VPN between your guildies/friends on a private IP 
range, and share your EQ log directories that way in much the same manner.
