I'd just go to the easier banded stuff at that point, and just do banded up
to 175.  That is, once you find a place where you can.  If you can shop in
Shar Vahl, you can get everything there.  If not, Shadowhaven is easy to
raise, takes maybe 30 minutes to an hour of tedious faction work, running
from Shadowhaven to the Bazaar and back.
