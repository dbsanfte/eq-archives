This may be a easy fix type answer question so here goes.  When you press
f-10 to cycle through different types of views for you screen you get the
default picture, the transparent windows and the full view.  My question is
on the transparent window screen how do I make my inventory screen
transparent too?  Each time I hit key with "I" it goes to the default
inventory screen.  Been through the books and may have missed something any
help again is appreciated, thanks.

Frederick J.
