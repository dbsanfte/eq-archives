I'm in a fun guild on Bertox called "The Dedicated." We are pledged to
honor, loyalty, and friendship. We are currently in open-recruiting and
would love to talk to you. Please drop by
http://pub4.ezboard.com/bnalscommandspot
or send a tell to me, Dariya, in game, or to our guildleader. He goes by
Naldaen or Waxumgud.
Look forward to meeting you,
-Dari
