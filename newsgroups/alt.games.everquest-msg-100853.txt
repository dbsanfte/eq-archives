Brian--

how do you like your Velium Short Blade?  My lvl 19 Ranger just got
one for Secondary ad it seems to be pretty good and getting better as
I'm increasing the Dual Weld skill.      (It procs at lvl 25 right?)  

I was wundering about the proc effect Velium Shards...  is it any
good?  Just exactly what is this effect?

(payed 200 plat for it on Drinal  with some armour trades  GREAT DEAL
I'M THINKIN!)
