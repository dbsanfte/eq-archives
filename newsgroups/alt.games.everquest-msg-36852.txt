You don't think it's likely they'll learn from their mistakes?  I mean, I
think that even most VI detracters will say that the game is better now than
it was 2 years ago, and you don't improve by making the same mistakes over &
over & over again.

Why?  Those who are level 50-60 have already been playing a couple years.  I
think many of us are fairly well burned out and are just waiting on DAoC or
another of the upcoming games.  Why would Verant care if they alienate
people that're leaving anyway?
