> SKs got a new DoT and FD.

    YESS!!! *finally* Shadowknight get exactly what we need out of an
expansion!

    IE *yet* another fuck-useless DoT and another feign death. That's three
now, or four if you've got the red pants. Our feign pulling abilities WERE
sadly lacking of course. When not feign pulling its a vaguely good upgrade
to feign death... but still I wouldn't have put an improved feign anywhere
near the top of our list of priorities for a 52 spell.

     And what a dot! at level 44 and above 180dmg in 36 seconds is.....
er..... so useless you can carve it. Still, it's almost as powerful as the
DoT *clerics* get at 39 so why complain ;)

    I know what I wont be blowing my money on any time soon <beam>

    I still think we should get foraged vegetables as a pet. It would be
more open and honest.

    At least duoing with a shaman will be ever *more* of a romp :)
