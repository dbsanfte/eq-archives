I don't get it.  Don't all classes get "Sense Direction"?

Why would there be a need for "an expensive tinkered
: magical item that would support some sort of enhancements
: for the directionally-challenged."  ??

Shamans (and perhaps others?) get a low-level True North spell that points
you North
that is (in my opinion) a complete waste.  Just use and raise your Sense
Direction skill.

Having said that,  I do find the maps at EQ Atlas very helpful and the idea
that
a Bard has already ventured the length and breadth of Norrath gathering
tales and
mapping the land is very plausible and within the role-playing aspects of
the game.

: This helps remove some of the tedium that the "where the
: hell am I" aspect adds to a lot of games.  I have an
: excellent sense of direction myself (I've often entered
: a zone, eyeballed a direction, hit autorun, and gone to
: the kitchen, only to return and find myself exactly
: where I had been aiming at, like right in the middle of
: the exiting zone tunnel), but I really feel for the people
: who don't.  My wife gave her Ranger the surname "Needsamap"
: (the game wouldn't accept "Lostalot").

: If Automapping is strictly against The Vision(tm), it might
: be nice to add something like an expensive tinkered
: magical item that would support some sort of enhancements
: for the directionally-challenged.
