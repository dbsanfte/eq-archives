If you're main is a druid, you have even less excuse of sticking
around.

On the other hand, if your main is a non-porting class, the time you
waste in a overcrowded zone and the amount of energy expended in
dealing with the frustration resulting from that is EASILY worth an
additional account.

But then, given the fuckwit replys I've seen from you, simple concepts
like that would be beyond you.  In fact, continue leveling at the pace
you are, the longer you stay out of the end game, the better off
everyone else who ARE at the end game will be.
