Our guild co-raided LGuk the other day.  Now we've got the very 
difficult problem of splitting loot.  We made 249pp and looted a weight 
reduction bag (which we rolled on there) and a ... whatever that rogue 
piercer is that drops in the ass sup room, forget it's name atm.  Lots 
of words and a few gems.  Now the question is - how do we split it up?  
We had a group/group and a half of our people there, quite a few coming 
and/or leaving late/early, one person from the other guild showed up 
then left halfway through the raid, and awhile later the leader of the 
other guild showed up and apologized for being late and said he'd had 
some RL problems that'd kept him from getting on, and stayed till the 
end of the raid.  What with all the coming and going it's hard (thought 
not impossible - I did manage to figure out who was there for what last 
raid) to keep track of who should/can have a claim to what.  I being the 
owner of the guild mule, shoved it all on to her and then broached my 
guild leader with the question of splits.  Only she doesn't have any 
more idea what to do about it than I do. :/  Any suggestions?

Ryou
