    Trolls would need a new one, as the troll on the hand is gone in
Innothule.

    Did you think to check Cabilis? From what I recall, the full selection
of spells is available either in the guild area, in the towers and tunnels
in the guild building, or on a "secret grotto" vendor in the other side of
town. Iksar don't need to leave Kunark to get their poison/disease spells.
