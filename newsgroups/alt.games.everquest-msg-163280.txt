Giggling manically and surrounded by armed hamsters, "Ronny Cook"
<ronny.justthebitbeforethedot@ronnycook.org> (if that IS his real
name) conspiratorially whispered:

>What's the single change made to Everquest that
>has most *improved* the game for you?

Kunark/Velious for increasing the depth of content.


>Also, what "improvement" to the game do you most dislike?

Luclin, for taking that same depth too far and making it too easy.
