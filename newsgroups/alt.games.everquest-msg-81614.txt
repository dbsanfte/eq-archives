As Lanella pointed out earlier, putting a 2/17 weapon in your
hand wouldn't make much sense over a 10/20 weapon.  Unless
you're level 60 and managed to keep your moss-covered twig...
;-)

But seriously, though, the absolute best thing is to parse  the damage
for yourself or run it through a weapon analyzer like Copeland's.
That way you can decide for yourself.  For instance, my alt
rogue recently picked up a Serpent's Tooth in the Hole.  13/27.
She does better damage with that main hand and her Shaded
Dagger off hand (11/22) than the other way around, even though
the Tooth is exactly half a second slower.  If she was soloing,
she'll switch 'em around.  Why? Because she wouldn't get the
chance to backstab, which is where the real damge comes into
play.  To be honest, when she goes around fighting things solo,
the doesn't even use her Tooth, she uses her Shaded and a
CSS, which is better damage if you're going to be facing things
the whole time.

Fast weapons are good..but when the choice is between a Trak
Tooth main hand or a Shaded Dagger, the dagger is going to have
higher damage output _even over a long fight_.  The 2 difference
in delay won't matter with the 20-40 point differences in your
backstabs.
