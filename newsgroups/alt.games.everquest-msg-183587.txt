Those Parsings I saw from our guildmonks, that were made after the
Monknerf, showed that Monks take way more damage than SKs.

I haven't said it is more efficient. I just said the SK would need less
healing per minute ...

sorry, but the Time that Monks take less dmg than others is over.
Do I like it? No, as it can make some Problems on Big Encounter Pulls.
Can I change it? No, but thats why I say: take SK ;)

SK pulls, Shaman Slows, Dots, Nukes and wont take dmg. The Shaman can
add the DSP easier than with a Monk as Tank.

Fighting Giants in BoT for Parchments...
Group: Mage Enchanter SK Cleric
Chainpulling all the time. SK needed max 1 CHeal per Mob. 2 if he had to
Split and got too much hit. (SK came back with 10%HP, I don't think Monk
would have survived that ;) )
Show me a Monk that does it the same way =)

Sorry, but higherlevel a Monk isn't a good Tank.
