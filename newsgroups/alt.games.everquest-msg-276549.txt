If its a choice between dumping copper and buying something to convert 
it, buy -anything- ... water flasks, rations, whatever is available... 
there are -many- items that sell back at only a small loss. And if your 
choosing between "destroy" and "lose 15%" I wouldn't stress over a 
little loss.

That said, by 20th level its generally not worth the time to make the 
trip to a merchant to do the exchange even if your lugging 2000 copper.

Few zones have merchants that accessible, and in the time it takes to 
find one you could have destroyed it and picked up 2pp or 20gp killing 
mobs.
