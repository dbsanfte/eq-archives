dont know if it makes sense to you, but Monks are masters of their
body, as a weapon and tool.  They (from all the martial arts movies
ive watched heehehhe) are able to endure pain beyond the normal
indivdual because of their training.    Ever seen karate kid... rofl
well mr. meagi(or what ever) was able to Mend the boys leg to help him
continue the combat.

just a thought

now this, I feel would be a great idea... why not even, it would not
unbalance the class in any way (that I can see)
