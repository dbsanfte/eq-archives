Took the KOS factor into account and decided there's no way a human 
ranger is going to be KOS to halflings.  Also took into account that at 
20th level, the gnolls that are 99% of the time wandering around near 
the zone to EK, AND those orcs that are always at the zone into 
Kithicor, can hit you a few times without it being a worry.  At level 
10, he's a) going to get hurt, bad, by those things and b) since he's 
never been there, he WILL get lost.  I don't care if he has a map, he's 
going to get lost.  And as anybody who's played in HHP/HHK can tell you, 
the guards aren't really all that dependable, strength-wise.  Besides, 
if you've got 6 mobs on you, and you run to a_guard, that guard's going 
to grab the first one and you'll still have 5 mobs.  I talked to a level 
29 tonight who *still* avoids HHP because he hates running through there 
(although he did change his mind awfully fast when  I introduced him to 
the HHK goblins :)).  Beholder's Maze, at least if you stay on the wall 
they won't aggro you, and Runnyeye, it is, as the original author of the 
instructions said, a 30 second run, tops.
