And often it doesn't or, at least, the extra mob isn't difficult to
pull.  You're making sweeping generalizations that simply
aren't true.   Simply getting one more level in Nadox allowed
my cleric (with mage partner) to pull *three* more mobs
per cycle, for instance.

Sure - to the people playing it safe at the zone line, to follow
the generalization.   Not to the people who now have the
ability to move to a different spot and take higher-level mobs
at the same pace because they've got more capability.

Right.  So why is someone splitting XP that could be going into
leveling into AAXP again?   General rule of thumb:  level first,
go straight AAXP until you get an AA that's actually useful,
then go back to leveling.  Once you've leveled, put it all into
AAXP...

There needn't be anything tedious about "playing the game
effectively."   You're just 'dissing' someone else's play style.

Oh.  Everyone is either like you or a PL idiot.  Gotcha.

And understanding the game doesn't mean you're necessarily
sitting in a full group chain-pulling in a safe spot either.  You're
the one who started with the sweeping generalizations if you
remember...

It's NOT *necessarily* a minor advantage, though.   Level
makes ALL types of differences.   *Some* AA make a
world of difference as well.

Just like saying that all the people who understand and/or care
about maximizing their experience are the idiots at the zone
lines and/or safe spots is ridiculous?   Yeah - I agree.

Yeah.   Then again, reading the first 100 pages of an 800 page
novel over 5 years doesn't let you get to the end, either, at
least not when any reasonable expectation is you won't have
time at that pace to ever "finish" it...

You're the one with the sweeping generalizations -- I'm just
pointing out it's just as easy to make generalizations the
other way.

Bottom line:  if I see someone camping a zone line, the *last*
thing I think is they're a min/max type.   The min/max types
are the ones deep inside the zone, taking risks -- and
beating them.   The ones at the zone lines or safe camps
are the more casual players in my experience.
