I agree with you in principle, but let's use a RL example.  Are the police
going to spend as much time investigating a report of a stolen pack of gum
as they are the robbery of a liquor store?  Those are both thefts ... if the
law applies to one then it should apply to all.

That's the way of life in any situation, though.  Take speeding.  Somewhere
there's a point where the trooper will come after you.  If the speed limit
is 70, they may give you 75 ... but at 76 they've got you pulled over.

There is also another intangible ... the state of mind of the trooper in
question.  If they've had a good day and are just waiting for another 45
minutes to pass before they go home, they may give you up to 80 then let you
off with a warning.  If they've had a lousy day, they may pop you at 72 ...
and you give them some lip, they may start looking into other things
(seatbelts, burned out lights, etc.).  Same goes for the GM.

That's part of why "judgement call" is probably the best answer to the
original question, IMO.
