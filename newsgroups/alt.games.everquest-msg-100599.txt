Yeah!  Let's just keep burning coal so we can all share the pain.

FYI they don't bury nuclear waste in randomly selected locations, nor do
they have a specific agenda against school kids.  This is the sort of
alarmist shit I generally associate with activists.  The plain truth isn't
as effective in inspiring college kids and others who fancy themselves
"independent thinkers" but who are, in fact, glorified sheep, to protest.

Some European nations are largly dependent on nuclear power.  France is one
of them.  It just doesn't seem to be the catastrophe that some people make
it out to be.  Have people died as a result of the use of nuclear energy?
Of course they have.  But how do the health and life safety issues of
nuclear power stack up against the same regarding fossil fuels?  That is
what you need to ask yourself.
