I dont' have much to say about most of the classes but here are a few items:

 Rouge:
- Not opposing MT

By the way it's Rogue-Rouge is a cosmetic.  If a rogue is facing a MOB
consistently and not even trying to get in BS's then he/she is a dumbass and
not worth taking up space in a group.  I've also seen a lot of rogues that
do not use evade efficiently.

> Shaman:
> - Not slowing melee mobs

Not every situation calls for slow.  In full or even large groups, the MOBs
will fall too quickly to make slowing mana efficient.  I prefer to save mana
for times when things get out of hand.  Having mana to back-up heal if the
cleric is being attacked, root adds or nuke away the last bub of health so
tanks can move to the next MOB is a much better use of mana in tricky
situations.

Poor shaman play to me would be buffing everyone whether they need it or
not.  Not using Canni to keep mana up. (if you see a shaman at full health
you gotta wonder)

> Warrior:
> - Not taunting before breaking mezz

Pulling without checking mana, especially after a big fight or chain pulling
for a while.

Not backing up after and ADD has been rooted.  Why waste mana on a root if
the tank is going to stay in aggro range and still get beat on?  Tank may
think "oh I'm a bad ass I can take it" but the point is to take less damage
and use less mana being healed.

This is true for any class that is playing MT not just warriors though.

I don't think poor play can be defined by saying that this class should
always do this or that.  But rather that each player should know their class
well enough to know how to adapt to different situations.  That is a
thinking player, not someone who does the exact same thing in every
situation.

Oh, by the way, a  poor chanter is one that you have to ask THREE times for
clarity and insists on being sowed when we are fighting 20 feet from a zone.
