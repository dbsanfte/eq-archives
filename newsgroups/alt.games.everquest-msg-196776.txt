By showing how absurd your question is.  In creating the game the
designers and developers have made many choices regarding how much
"automation" to provide for various game mechanics.  Amazingly
enough they decided not to make every character class the same as
every other character class.  It would appear that, unlike certain
self-absorbed individuals, they figured the game ought to offer
variety its players.  If you want to play a highly automated class
play a Warrior.  If you want to play a very busy class play a Bard.
If the level of automation means nothing to you choose your class
based on other factors.  If your preference varies from session to
session play multiple character classes.  Or, if you feel like
playing a dumbass, come to a.g.e and whine about Bards requiring
more physical activity than other classes.

Well, if pointing out that you had managed to come as close as humanly
possible to asking a stupid question makes me an ass, then so be it.

Wrong.  It's a requirement.  You may think it's stupid, your opinion
does not make it so.

It's similar to that yes.  Amazingly enough, as I pointed out above,
the designers didn't choose to make everything the same.

Wrong again, I am doing me best to show you your obtuseness.

We've already covered that.

A more accurate response would have been that you were too dense
to figure it out why it was relevant without having it spelled out
step by step.

See above.

IMNSHO, I was not acting like an ass.  What I did was to provide you
with some not very subtle clues in hopes that you could figure the
rest out on your own.  Apparently I was wasting my time.

I have pointed out the obvious in a bit more detail above.  But I'm
betting that you're too much in love with the idea that "twisting as
it is is stupid because Ed says it is" to have understood what I wrote.

I do so love irony!  That gift alone made your post most entertaining!
Oh, and one more thing:
Bite me.

You're welcome.
