The LOIO to FV run, and crossing the DreadLands from the Druid ring to
the FV zone, whenever I disregard my own advice about taking the boat
instead. Those are the two that scare me the most these days.

But I remember that what got me hooked on Everquest was the feeling of
fear of being alone in the woods at night, in East Commons. Then I
*knew* EQ was something special.
