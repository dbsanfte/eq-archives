True, but for pete's sake, the heavy-handed changes made it damned hard for
*anyone* to hunt there now.

I had hunted in The Grey for two days prior to the patch, and
tried again after the patch.

Prior to the patch, it was a good place to hunt with a full
group, especially one with an Enchanter since the place
is pretty train-worthy.  Even then, we'd have to run for
the zone every once in a while, it's not like The Grey
was tame even before the patch.

After the patch, group after group tried and tried again,
and had to run screaming to the zone.  Trains of even 2-4
mobs are dangerous as hell when they're pretty much 100% magic
resistant.

Also, before the patch my 54 Paladin could solo the skeletons
with luck and judicious use of Expel/Instrument of Nife/Root/
Fear.  Although it took most of the mana bar and I'd have to
run to the zone if a second one aggroed, at least I could keep
busy if I couldn't find a group right away.  Now?  Forget it,
I got 8 spellcasting resists in a row, and NO successes.

Uh oh...  Is this more "people could actually hunt there, we had
to make sure they couldn't" tunings?
