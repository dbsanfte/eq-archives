I've rarely seen BoA offerred, and never found it on the couple
occasions I went lokking for it.  But then, recently I've been
playing mostly casters and don't care anymore.

I could never bring myself to wait in line for hours (yes, hours)
behind all the Druids and other casters who were after that camp.
Tho I'll admit that I never went to Guk at all with my Warrior, by
then I was so sick of going there with my Paladin that I would
solo him in Kunark and later in Velious (GD), solo because there
were no spots in groups for Paladins unless it was a guild group
or Dreadlands, and Kaev's guild at the time wasn't worth a hill o'
beans (I know, I know, my own fault...) and DL got old fast too.
