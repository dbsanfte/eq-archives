You would be amazed at how many people dont know you can buy them in
West Freeport for a little over 1pp for a BACKPACK full of them, but
regardless, my druid isnt in EC, but in Gfay instead.  Now I dont know
if you can buy them in unlimited quantities in Faydark like you can at
the Mages Guild in WFP, but I see a LOT of people offering a lot more
in Gfay than I ever have in EC.

I dont know if I agree with that.  I wanted foraged goodies to bake
with to cater a wedding the other day (last minute notice) and I
offered 5pp per stack simply because I needed them now.  Sure, I could
have bought some food components in EC but I wanted variety=)
