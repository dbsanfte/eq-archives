If taunt is a skill that increases the more you use it (I've only
played casters so I've not had taunt) then you should definitely still
mash the button even when you have aggro.

To not do so is missing an opportunity to increase your skill. It's
like saying "I know I'm heading North so there is no point pressing
the Sense Heading button". If you don't max your skill out then that
decision will come to bite you in the rear when you need to taunt that
mob off your groups healer and it doesn't work!

Besides, any caster worth his spells will not rely solely on the tank
to taunt the mobs off them anyway but will have their own methods for
dealing with the problem (roots, stuns, pets etc) as well. The
relatively short time that taunt would take to refresh is not ideal
but worth it, IMHO, to ensure that the tank taunts as effectively as
they can.

Just my 2 pennies worth :)
