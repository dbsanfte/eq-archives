Why are you fighting 3 at a time without crowd control?  Get a bard,
enchanter, or someone with root (perhaps you) to reduce the fight
to one at a time.

Perhaps they're used to working with an enchanter.  When someone is on
crowd control duty, they SHOULD all stay on the main target.  And if
nobody's talked about it, staying on target is a better reaction than
switching.

In the case where you don't have an ideal group and can't move somewhere
that you can get mostly single pulls, you're right.  One of the tanks
should be designated as the "main assist" who chooses a target and stays
on it, and the other tanks should be on "taunt duty", and switch targets
as needed to keep opponents on them.

The key is to discuss it before the fight starts.  Having all tanks
randomly switching targets is as bad as having none of them switch.

You're both right.  The tank should help (if that's his job - this
should be discussed before the fight).  But you should never run around.
Ever.  Move away if it's rooted, fine.  Run to zone if you can make it,
fine.  But running aimlessly just guarantees you'll die.
