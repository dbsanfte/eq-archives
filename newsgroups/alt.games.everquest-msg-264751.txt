Not all the guilds have such requirements. Just the ones that have web
sites. =)

Well that's not entirely true either. My guild on FV is a RP guild
with a web site and will accept anyone into the ranks that puts forth
the consistent effort to role play.

There are a great many guilds out there that do not have level or gear
requirements. Only if you are looking to join a raiding guild will
that be a problem.
