An interesting idea, but it would be awkward because the faction
hits are often small.  If a mob or quest gives you +1 faction,
having high charisma make it +2 would be huge.

On the other hand, I could see applying charisma to the total
faction number.  Assume you start at 0 relative to, say, Guards
of Qeynos, and can go to -2000 or +2000 before being told it
"can't get any worse/better".  Then a high charisma might make
a -2000 into, say -1500, and a +1500 into +2000.  You still
couldn't get above +2000 (because that may be a deliberate
limit), but getting the effect of +2000 would be easier with
high charisma.  (Likewise, low cha could push things the other
way.)

It would make it more interesting running around in the old
world, where factions matter more.  E.g., you might be KOS to
some guards or wandering NPCs, but if you wield your opal steins
you're merely dubious to them (but then don't have your weapons
equipped).

Ah well, just musing.
