Why?

There are already four races in the game which cannot make a pure caster of
any type.   Why do we need to assume they will have at least one?  Just
because the Iksar had one?

Yep.  They can be paladins in the case of High Elves, and paladins or
shadowknights for Erudites, but they cannot be pure warriors.

No proof, of course, but my guess is they will make it cat only.

My question is "What special abilities do you think the cats will have?"
Iksar came with Regeneration, Infravision, Forage, Swimming and an Armor Class
bonus. Easily the best special ability list of any race.  And the worst
faction position of any race.

What will the kitties get?   Hairball attack that works like a projectile
Death Touch? ;)
