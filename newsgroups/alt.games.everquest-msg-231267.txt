I'm not sure if this is a goof or intentional, but when playing around
with 3rd person camera angles on Test, I realized that when I dropped
the camera elevation (alt+numpad2), it went down below the normal
level. Upon experimenting, I found that there doesn't appear to be any
limit to how far you can raise or lower it anymore. I had it raised up
so high, I couldn't even see my character anymore looking straight
down and it was still going up. I kinda hope they keep this. It'd be
wonderful for screenshot artists to get better angles of character
shots.
