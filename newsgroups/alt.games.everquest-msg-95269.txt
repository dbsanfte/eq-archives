Been soloing Giants since low 30s. Hillocks only at first then tumps around 35 or 36. I stay away from the caster goblins unless I
am with a partner. Here is my gear. Some good some not so good.

All of which I obtained myself or bought in either Bazaar or EC with the plat made in FM and from selling handmade backpacks I made
from the HQ rockhopper hides.
