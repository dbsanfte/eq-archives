UH OH!! He's right!!  Using a credit card before trying a product is
so stupid to do.  And all of those tens of thousands of people with
AOL that have to give a credit card to use their free 1000 hours are
stupid too.  Oh MY GOD!!  All of America is stupid!

Wake up dumb ass!  A Credit Card is a legal form of identification
used on the internet to verify that an individual is 18 years of age. 
I highly doubt that SONY is going to suddenly disappear with all of
our credit card numbers.  Large corporations can't just disappear into
thin air....ask Enron, they're trying.

Just because you give them your Credit Card number does NOT mean you
are instantly being charged.  You are charged AFTER your free month.

It's unfortunate that you didn't bother to read all of the pretty
letter that were on the screen when you registered your EQ, it says it
all right there.

Who's uneducated?
