Owie.. But that's not technically a bug. If you go LD while moving,
your LD self continues going until the LD time runs out and logs the
character out. It just happened to run out as soon as you went over
the edge of the chasm. You logged in where you went LD.

That said, I imagine you would have gotten a GM rez for it, anyway.
