Single group to the royals; cleared past library and pulled some of king
room, stopped short of pulling king:

59 rng
59 rng
60 rog
60 enc
60 dru
60 clr

Was a while ago though. I'm 60 now. I was one of the rangers then.

EEEK no warrior! How did we do it? RANGERS tanking 6 sarnaks at a time? SHOCK!

Also done the hole to yael with no enchanter, other "raid" level stuff with
no cleric using the 60 druid, as main healer, etc, etc.

The "holy trinity" are holy for 3 reasons:

1) Safety margin when you really are doing something novel and want maximum
   chance of success.
2) Ignorance.
3) Incompetence.

If you dont like high level raids then hey, dont go on them. Plenty of other
stuff to do; fwiw one of our raid organisers decided to make a point and put
together a west wing tov (no, not even ntov or anything) raid with only
"requried" classes. 

After attending everyone swore to never go again without the usual mishmash
of damage dealing rangers, spot healing druids, etc.

Well fucking duh. You can get xp a fun way or you can get xp a boring way,
so you choose the boring way.

This isnt a broken game being described. Its a broken player.

"Gee, these playstyles dont suit me, I dont enjoy them, I think I'll use them
to the exclusion of the alternatives".

The new chat channels help immensely for that, but to be honest we've never
had problems just using ooc/auction/shout for raid comms and guild or say
for chatter.

Maybe in your experience. But what everyone else is saying tells you that using
the *same system* you're describing they have fun and goof off. What, you're too
dull to entertain yourselves and sit silently buffing and its the games fault?

Oh no, sorry, its someone elses raid and they MAKE you be silent. And you still
go.

Yeah.

And dont tell me you need raid loots. I'm almost entirely equipped in single
group luclin and velious drops and I have velious level raider stats.

Shrug. We've had similar situations. Chanters warn when they're going LoM...
a LoM cleric camps. People with non aggo roots start rooting mezzed critters
so when it breaks they're not everywhere. You tank mez. Your necros work
for you. All those non essential classes suddenly become essential.

Seriously; yes we do this. If you've gotten so coddled by the "boring routine"
you cant operate without it thats not because the options arent there.

Sure, they're not *as* good. But they work. Just learn em. Live with less
safety margin sometimes and the skills you pick up will give you MORE safety
margin if your chanters go to hell.

Sounds like you need a new game to me. I turn off spell effects so I can
see whats going on with 6 sorcerors trying to KS each other, but I dont
HAVE to. And if you *do* well, what should VI do? Not provide eye candy
so those who cant afford high end hardware arent "deprived" of it? Force
it on all the time so the high enders are happy and the low enders are screwed?

Or provide a cut down version for people who need it when theres a lot of
folk in one place?

Thats beause a lot of folk LIKE it. Theres plenty to do if  you dont like the
big communal get togethers. ToV on my server runs at 120 folks a night now.

Thats crazy. But people like being with their guildies, folks they like and 
trust, and goofing off in a big gang.

If you dont like it, find something else to do. Not like there arent 
interesting fun one/two group things to do out there.
