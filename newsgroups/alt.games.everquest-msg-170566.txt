I got a group together in KC last night.  The last few group I've played
with in there usually seemed to have an Achilles Heel, so I've been pretty
cautious about grouping there, i.e. bailing out at first sign of
incompetence.  There were very few people in there last night on my server,
so it tool awhile for me and the pally I initially hooked up with to get a
group.  Healers weren't present at all.  No druid, clerics, shammies,
nothing.  No real tanks either.  So we eventually just hooked up with
whomever we could muster up.
Eventually got:
52 Bard (me)
51 Pally
53 Pally
54 Pally
52 Rogue
52 Wizzie

ROCK ON!  We slaughtered everything that came!  Adds!  Other people's
trains!  MORE ADDS!  MORE TRAINS!!!  BRING IT *ALL* ON!!!!

No-one died in about 3 hours of play and we had virtually zero downtime.
Pally's played ghetto healers and tanked,  I pumped in haste, slow, mana
song(s), zing, melee, rogue happily backstabbed, and the wizzie, well,
wizzied his ass off.  There was no need of a real tank or healer, and the
only one that really drew aggro was me with all the buffing and stuff.  I've
been in a few more "traditionally balanced" groups, so to speak, recently
that wound up with dead chanters, zoning clerics, overpulls, and near tpo's
and would never have even considered a group like this working well.

Anyone else here ever been in an odd combo group that worked surprizingly
well?

SEAN...
