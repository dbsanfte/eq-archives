EQs graphics engine is not "new" in SoL, it is updated to take
advantage of DX8.1 features and now includes larger and more complex
textures.

The graphics engine in EQ is most likely pushing past it's own
limitations and busting at the seams. That would explain the insanely
high hardware requirements and poor performance in zones with high
polygon counts (eg Bazaar, Shar Vahl). 

I don't think it is simply a case of bad coding, though I am sure
there is some bad code in there.
