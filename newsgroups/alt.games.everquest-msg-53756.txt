Absolute bunk. Some of the very best pick-up groups I've been in were in
Highpass, and we not only held the pass we held it all day with I believe
only 1 death. Get a druid or ranger in the group and never again lose a
mob to the guards. (Besides, you let a half-dead orc get away from you
there, getting KS'd by a guard is the LAST thing you should worry about.)
