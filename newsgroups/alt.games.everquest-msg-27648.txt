Just my op, but the shark that spawns off the East Freeport docks is one of
the best low level money making methods in FP. Not sure if you are there
level wise yet.

You should have no trouble going to the Tunnel and selling a stack of bone
chips for 5 pp each. Last time I was in the zone, people were paying ~6 pp
for HQ pelts other then bear and 30-50 pp for HQ bear.

My perpetually broke wizard <he gives away his junk except for enough to buy
a spell or two per 4up> got a 50 pp tip for buying 80 gems for a jeweler. It
is a money making zone.

People, /auc buying DF belts 1 pp/ec, all the time.
