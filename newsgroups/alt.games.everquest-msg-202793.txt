Its not even that good. Feign pulling is best accomplished by a sk who can
use the darkness line of spells to split mobs in addition to all of the
normal pulling tricks.

A good group needs,
cleric
slower
crowd control
puller
dammage dealers
buffers
snarer
tanker

monks do not satisfy any of those requirements well . They are ok pullers in
some situations but then so are chanters. They are ok dammage dealers only
beaten out by rogues, wizards , magicains , beastmasters , necros. They are
close in dammage to several other classes.

The sad fact is that prenerf monks where significantly underpowered, easily
in the bottom 5 of the 15 classes. A pure melee class is only tanking and
dammage and seriously nerfing one seriously nerfed the class.
