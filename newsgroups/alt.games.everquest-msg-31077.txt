I play a solo mage and I enjoy it very much even tho' there are
disadvantages to the class. Medding after a battle, bad pathing for the pets
in dungeons, no ability to break multiple spawns (only one or two at a time,
form an orderly line please) and no ability to port.
The good things are being able to take things down fast, being able to work
in confined spaces (try kiting in a dungeon), cool colors and effects, being
able to summon just about everything you need, reagents being cheap and
plentiful (no hunting for bone chips) and watching the looks on the faces of
that full group of comparable level melee and hybrids as you take down the
same type yellow mob in 30 seconds that they just spent three minutes
kicking and bashing into submission.
Mages are a very powerful class for soloing and the down time isn't really
that bad.
