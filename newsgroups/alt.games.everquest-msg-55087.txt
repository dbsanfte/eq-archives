100p/hour is slow money for a high level druid. giants in RM are somewhere
around 200p/hour, and there are plenty of other places you can farm, either
for sale to pc's or npc's (not saying where, find out for yourself). Its
hard to quantify the profit from spell drops in skyfire, but you can get
real lucky here, and its xp while youre farming as well.

For a 29+ necro or a 24+ mage or a 34+ druid (earthquake), you can make
about 100p/hour doing the bandit sash quest in SK/qeynos south.
