The instanced zones that you get sent to for talking with Gamesh are not
trials. They're just experience instanced zones to play in. For the trials
you have to go speak with the High Priest for your instanced zone. The zones
you get from Gamesh are not as difficult as a LDoN hard while the ones that
you get from the High Priest are more difficult than an LDoN hard. The
common mobs can hit for over 1200.

| Forget the "Sewers are for Elemental geared people" BS.

| A group of players that have never even gotten to the
| Tower of What's-his-name Ro can XP in the Purifying
| plant sewer with ease.  They can also beat the boss mob
| and get flagged for the next trial.
|
| The other trials had lackluster XP, but we were getting
| ~2.5% of an AA per mob in the front room of PP.  There
| are 11 mobs on a ~20minute timer on the top ledge, 2
| roamers in the water, and a couple in the center.  More
| than enough to keep you busy (with only 2 during our
| pull cycle that needed pacify to split).
|
| Considering you can get this zone to yourself by simply
| walking up to Gamesh and saying "Plant", it's my new
| favorite AA grinding spot I think.
