    Nobody asked about solo DPS. If you did, you couldn't parse monk DPS
either because you'd be creamed if you tried to take on a PoP XP mob alone,
without your other boxes to save you. ;-)

    Yep. If you have hits on anyways, it isn't that hard. And it's not like
damage shields deal random amounts of damage.

    Where I've seen figures being thrown about are on pet procs. Those
numbers I'd take with a grain of salt, because there's no way to accurately
tell what that damage is. But damage shield DPS isn't hard to figure out if
you're actually parsing hits anyways. Remember, it doesn't have to be the
mage parsing the combat damage!

    I wouldn't spot them number one, either. That's an enchanter with any
charmed pet. But mages in my guild speed up kill rate as much as one of our
rogues would, and that's impressive.
