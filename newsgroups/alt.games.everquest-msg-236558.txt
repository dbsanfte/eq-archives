On 22 Feb 2004 12:11:31 -0800, I needed a Bable Fish to understand
gr82meetu78@yahoo.com (Steve) :

>Ok race aside, which class is better Warrior or Beserker?

Its a case by case situation... If you want a tank (one who can absorb
damage) a warrior is better, and Always will be.  If you want DPS
(damage dealer) the Berserker will be better.

To get a feel for the class, to help understand their capabilities for
when one joins my group.

They are NOT warriors, Warriors are Plate class, Berserkers are Chain
class.  Berserkers get Frenzy skill, which give the possibility of 3
extra attacks in a round.  They also get Summon thowing axe abilities,
and can use these axes to do special attacks... one for example is a
Snare if it hits.

>Also on a side, note, which race will tend to make the best Beserker?

Best race... it the usual answer... play what you want to play.. they
all can work out well... Me, I made an Ogre, for one because I haven't
ever really played one.

>Another question, I realize this is a new class, but has anyone
>written a guide to Berserkers, from creation on out?

There are some out there... do a search 

>Thanks in advance for the replies.

Check these out as well
