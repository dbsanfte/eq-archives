Was this with any other haste buffs on you?

Also, what level mobs were you killing when you parsed this?  +attack
buffs seem to be most important for MOBs near or above your level.

Mine is to acquire, or better yet, fletch an elemental bow.  :)

If you can group with any pet class, EQ and AM3 are *very* nice.  Get
better DPS and let the pet (which will probably mitigate better than
you) take the hits.  I have duoed with a shaman friend on a few
occaisions.  Either I pull with snare, he slows, we wait for the pet
to start taunting, and I jolt...or he just pulls with slow and roots
it.  A few nukes later and I'm doing double damage again.
