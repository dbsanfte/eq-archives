Ouch... Here's a few things that helped me save some ice
1. Make macros song1, song2, etc. Each macro is something like 
"/stopsong;/cast1". Now instead of hitting a song twice to stop previous 
and start this one, you hit it once. Actually helps with timing a bit, 
so when I really pay attention, I can twist 4 songs now
2. Gamepad. Not to be lame, but to make it easier. I have 3 buttons on 
it that do "1", "2", and "3" respectively. When my left hand is starting 
to flame a bit, you can move the gamepad in the other hand :)
2a. I also have a button that twists 3 songs. I don't get to use it much 
cause every now and then it drops songs, but it's nice for when you need 
to take a nice long duration crap :)
