As a level 58 warrior, when I go bezerk, I can still have well over 1300 hit
points left when I go bezerk (depending on buffs).   Against most blues and
anything slowed, that is still a big chunk of life.   Also, at level 54 you
get a discipline that will make all hits critical hits for ten seconds.   It's
a pretty awesome sight to see, using that the moment you go beserk (while the
cleric is casting complete heal.)
