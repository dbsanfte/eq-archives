If you had the choice between a +STA item that would add X HP, or a +HP item
that would add X, wouldn't the +STA item be better, if the items were
otherwise the same?

The idea here is that STA might be used in formulas other than just the one
that determines HP, and so boosting STA might give other benefits besides +X
HP, whereas a +X HP item just adds X HP.

This is not just an EQ thing.  In most games that follow the basic D&D model
of having a few stats that are used to compute things like HP, AC, mana,
etc., achieving a given effect by boosting the stat is better than achieving
it by something that gives that effect directly.
