Not that high. Lots of memory, but it's cheap and you don't need a fast cpu
or top of the range video card.

True, and this expansion seems to add lots of new gameplay too.

I bet just the opersite. I bet only a few people have cancelled and I bet
many of
them would have found an excuse to cancel anyway. I'd bet there are more
people like myself who were slowly getting bored of the game and might
have cancelled in a few months if they hadn't made a real effort to produce
a superb new graphics engine, and lots of interesting new zones.

I don't know why you'd think this. They have a monthly income that most
software houses could only dream of. Servers and bandwidth are expensive
but I bet they are still makeing a profit or why would they keep adding new
stuff? If they were losing money they wouldn't be investing in keepijng the
game going as long as possible.
