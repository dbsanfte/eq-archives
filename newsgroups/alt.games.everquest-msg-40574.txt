Define decent.
Because 1 or 2 group in ToV is called CR, more precisely Conjure
Corpse + 12 coffins.

One group is simply not enough, the damage output isn't there.  Two
groups might kill stuff there if they can get single pulls.

Non-CoV groups can't single pull the entry way stuff, they may get
doubles and win if they are very tank and cleric heavy.  Two wurms?
Forget it.  It's wipeout time.

CoV groups have two wurms right at the start of the east wing.

ToV North with 2 groups...Hahahahahahahahahahahaha!  The stupid chain
rampaging wyverns will plow through two groups before you can say "WTF
is Ikitar?!?"
