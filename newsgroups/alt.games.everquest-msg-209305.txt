For the sake of argument, I will point out that I often end a battle at
100% and I was still hit...it was simply that my hitpoint regeneration was
good enough to compensate.  But I'll take your word for it that you also
were not receiving any messages of being hit.

In any case, the fact remains that I will still always believe a solid set
of parses before I believe a story or a feeling from a player.  And the
important thing to note here is that so will many who cast can cast
agility.

The following is a warning to all melees who have not experienced the
phenomenon of the Shaman Who Won't Take It Anymore (they have
self-berzerker spells, remember?):

Many, like Graeme, will simply sit down, mem the spell, and cast it on you
to keep you happy. A few however will simply say "no", and it is best if
you don't heckle them, especially if they are main healer.  And there is
the further category that might break into profanities and you will
suddenly find they don't slow the mobs that are on you as fast.  This
latter kind is probably having a bad day and should be treated with
sympathy.  They are not unhelpful bastards, and likely they can play their
class very well...they are simply Sick and Tired of Dumb Melees
(tm).  Don't take it personally, but I'd advise against arguing with them.

Dr. Rakyn the Alchemist and Mr. Hyde is what I call him...normally a
sweet-mannered, helpful, gentlemanly shaman, then someone asks for dex or
agi when he's in the middle of envying a cleric or druids long-lasting,
unarguably-useful buffs...and WHOMP, "Rakyn goes into a berserker
rage!".  Ohhh, sig idea coming on....

So yes, I have done my public service and warned you. :)
