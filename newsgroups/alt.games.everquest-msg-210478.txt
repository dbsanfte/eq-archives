My enchanter is 63.  He still uses his epic as a free AC affect for casters
if we suspect they'll get hit.  And it's one of the few haste buffs that
work for battle clerics.

Druid...crappy dot but long-lasting.  And it's free.  Very useful for
soloing or long fights.

If you're in a planar guild, good for you (but I honestly don't give a
shit), but many epics are still good for the N000bs that aren't uber like
you.
