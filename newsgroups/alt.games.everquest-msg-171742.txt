Well, Tempters of Fate is rebuilding, but we've got a good solid core to
build on.  If you would like to give us a try, go ahead and give any of my
toons a tell (or let me know when you'll be on).  Precia is my main and the
co-leader, but Tenjou or Eitchi may be on instead.  Just let me know that
you're from here.
