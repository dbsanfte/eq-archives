 Lowered the resistances on uber mobs but gave them a boatload of HPs to
'balance' that. Dain was easier before the resistance change. Yelinak as
well. So I'm not really sure they are making it easier to get gear from
these encounters they are just allowing more classes to actually feel
useful. Although I'm not sure how useful a caster feels after they fully
land a nuke that ends up getting them summoned and killed. A side effect
to that is that they're also pushing the uber encounters further away
from some guilds who may not be able to muster a zerg-sized force.

 No arguement there. Not to mention it's in the boonies and nobody wants
to go there.
