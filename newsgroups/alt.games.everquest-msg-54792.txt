The thing is though bad things can happen in these circumstances. The
movelog is first come, first serve, with those living in Europe being
lumped into the group which is first for certain. However, if that
group of euros is big enough all of them are not going to be able to
go (and none of the non euros will) 

What that means is you could send in your thing to go and get on it
but maybe enough of the people you need to be that uberguild on that
new server don't get on there. Then you'd be stuck on that new server
without an uberguild or the ability to raid dragons or planes in the
first 2 weeks or perhaps some time to come.

You also really never know exactly how many people say they will
within the time window will actually bother to do so.
