Some people make a career out of playing games like this (I mean without
actually being employed by the company).  They're convinced that they can
somehow "win" the game if they just put in enough time/effort/money and
they'll do whatever they think it takes to accomplish that.  I don't
understand that philosophy myself, but it's Sang's time, money, and effort,
so if he wants to spend them that way, I have no problem with it.
