Just about going LD and dying... which admittedly happens a lot
when fighting, but also happens when you didn't see a mob at all,
but your character didn't poof until after it aggro'd something and
died.

Even when fighting, you'll see people run off... if the LD hit when
they were in motion, the system doesn't differentiate between moving
three feet and moving a quarter mile, if you are moving at the
very moment of LD you -keep- moving unless interrupted.

I'm not suggesting that its a -good- plan, just explaining what the plan is.
And yes, adding
/shout I"m LD, Training %t to the (whichever zone you are headed for) zone line!

would not be a bad idea if they were to do this

Better is relative.  If you are soloing, then there are no team mates to get
involved.
If you are in an outdoor zone, there likely isn't going to be much of a train.
If the option is settable, then if used judiciously it shouldn't cause much
trouble,
but might leave a lot less LD Dead casters out there.  Its the casters and
to a lesser extent healers that suffer the most here, a tank who stops using
her special powers really doesn't degrade that much in ability, and tends to
have the HP and AC to stand there and toe to toe melee for the minute or
so it takes to poof.  Casters who decide to try the same thing, LD or not,
tend to crumble like an egg under an SUV.

Res is only available to people with cleric buddies over 39 (ok, 29 sort of)
handy,
or less than a quarter of the players.  LD Death happens to -everyone- and
in some ways is a bigger PITA to the lowbies, really.  Don't fall into the
Verant Vision trap of planning only for the high levels, that mentality really
sucks drake eggs.
