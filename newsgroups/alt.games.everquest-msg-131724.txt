*chuckle*  I felt this way too.  My first raid was Befallen, and I 
enjoyed it so much (despite getting stuck in a rock >_<) that when I 
heard the slightest whispered rumor of a Najena raid, I looked it up on 
Najena and decided to level to my high 20s in order to enjoy more than 
just the stuff at the entrance.  I was 27 by the time I went in, almost 
made it to 28 by the end of the night, and had a heck of a lot of fun.  
And.... it was worth it :D  (I did, however, have more time to make it 
from 14-27 than you do to make it to 30 - good luck!  And make sure you 
take a break after the raid and, oh, try a tradeskill.  Trust me, 
that'll make you *happy* to go back to exp-grinding ;))
