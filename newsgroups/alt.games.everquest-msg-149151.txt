NO, I'm running it and it's fine.  The only thing is I can only play EQ when
logged into the local machine.  If I log into my domain, EQ crashes to
desktop.  Haven't figured that one out yet.
Change those settings at the link I posted above and you should be golden.
It's all I had to do to get mine to work.  I had been disconnected several
times every hour until I changed a few settings.

Good luck!
SEAN...
