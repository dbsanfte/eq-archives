Yesterday afternoon I logged on to a guildie looking to get an exp group 
going for Howling Stone.  I've had the droppable part of the quest for 
probably 10 months, but never had the Xalgoz piece.  The druid happened to 
have the piece on his twink, so we met in DL and run at best bard speed to 
SoNH, do the quest, and run back to wait for the rest of the group.  On 
the way through FV I saw a monk auctioning a 10-slot bag with 85% weight 
reduction, for 2k, which seemed to me a better deal than another tinkerers 
bag, so I picked that up too.
Meet up with the some of the stragglers, and other than a duel and rez 
followed by a death and rez because the main tank couldn't find the bank 
he was bound at (ogres, yep, still stupid), we got to the HS zone pretty 
uneventfully. 
We zoned in, and without a rogue had to fight for keys.  We cleared north 
wing very quickly, had to kill a couple placeholders before the mob with 
the west wing key spawned.  We got keys to west wing, charged in and 
cleared until I fell in a trap, then had to all fall down, succor to zone, 
and rush back again.  We beat the respawn, got to where we were, cleared 
around another corner, and I fell in again.  Drop, succor, fight through 
respawn, get one or two named, then have main tank fall into trap.  It was 
time to call it a night after this, so we headed out.  With a generally 
non-optimal group (war, dru, wiz, bard, clr, clr) we were able to really 
DO this dungeon, get great exp, and have no more than one other group in 
the zone at any time.  I can't believe I've gone this long without the HS 
key.  All I can say is that anyone level 50 and above who wants a great 
place for solo classes, small groups, and full groups needs to get their 
key now.  Don't let this little gem pass you by.  I just wish I found this 
place 10 levels ago. 

Arolpin
still no ST key
