I had a similar issue with a Kunark box i bought. When i went to install the
CD key it installed luclin instead!?! Then when i tried to access my account
it told me i had luclin enabled and no files on my machine, after getting in
touch with eqtexh they sent me a kunark cd key and everything was fine.

I bought the gold box (for my other machine) and tried installing the luclin
files on my old machine, and it worked with luclin :)

So your problem may be Verants end, so best of luck to you!
