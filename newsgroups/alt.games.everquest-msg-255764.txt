1 encounter serve 54 people for 6 hours vs 1 encounter serve 6 people
for 2 hours.

Work out the economic development option. What you would prefer is
irrelevant; its what you'll put up with.

Thats a ludicrous line of argument. Its like saying the casuals
dont -want- XP grinds or phat lewts because *some* dont. Trying to homogonise
EQ into 'casuals' and 'raiders' is an excercise in futility, especially
when discussing motivations. One look at any large guilds internal drama
and politics should show you that.

Depends on your assumptions regarding soe's motivation; to produce an immersive
entertaining game ('vision' based) or to milk a cash cow ('business' based).

My interpretation of the current evidence is the latter; what would be best
is irrelevant. What will drive away the minimum number of customers and attract
the highest number of new players  is preferable.
