Does improved dodge 3 stack with any other improved dodge items you may 
have, or is it like haste where you only get whichever one is best?  What 
about the spell shield +3% aug?  I was thinking of trying to build up an 
improved dodge augment, but if it does not stack then that will be a huge 
waste as soon as an item with dodge focus drops.  Maybe spell shield will be 
better to try for if it stacks, and if the cap is not too low.
