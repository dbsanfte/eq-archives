It does reflect on how seriously they take their word when they give

And that has what to do with dumping on a critic? That was smacking
someone in the face for being so dense as to accuse me of seriously
wishing for someone to get themselves killed. A claim which was so
wildly off-base isn't going to be taken well. Especially given that it
was a rather desperate dig at my character and showed a complete and
utter lack of understanding of the ways of Usenet that one who has
been around as long as Taras should be far above.
