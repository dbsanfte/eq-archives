	The same can be said of Diablo II, but there are probably as many people
playing D2 at this very moment as are playing EQ.

	Sooner or later, there is going to be an "end game state your character
could achieve".  Probably sooner than later, too -- there is really nowhere
they can go after PoP.

	90% of the people on the server still won't have the same damn stuff you
do, and they never will.

	Then it's not much of an encounter, is it now?

	Because the designers are spending the bulk of their time trying to stay
ahead of the munchkins, the game has no breadth to it whatsoever.  Once you
hit raid level everyone has to pass the exact same hurdles, because the gear
you need for zone N drops from zone N-1 and nowhere else.  Personally I'd
really like to not kill mobs on CoV faction -- my character has no earthly
reason to do so -- but if I ever want to fight nameds in Luclin, that's not
going to be an option.  This is a stupid way to design a game, and it was done
solely to cater to a very small percentage of the paying customers.
	
|Time-starved power gamers are a larger segment than you seem to think. And

	"Time-starved power gamers" are nothing but a rhetorical tool VanCouvering
tried to fobb off so he could define his way into victory in an argument over
casual players.

	There is going to be a "stunted endgame", like it or lump it.  Eventually
the designers will have to concede that they simply can't make the numbers any
bigger.  Thematically we are already there; there is nothing they can add to
top PoP.  Where are the players supposed to go after killing all of the gods
-- Disneyland?  It would have been far better for the game had the designers
realised this limit earlier.
