Here's an idea to make it less of a joke.  First third is borrowed from
DAoC, rest is my idea.

1. Pickpocketed loot should autosplit, with a message to the the group
telling the group that the Rogue has pickpocketed and giving the amount.

However, the problem with this in EQ is that autosplit works poorly, because
each type of coin is considered indepenently, and it cannot convert one type
to another.  This leads to 2:

2. Make it so pickpocketed loot is automatically converted to something that
will split fairly.  So, if you pickpocket 1p and have two people, it gets
converted to 10g before the split.

This makes it so that a group with a Rogue, if they make sure to have to
Rogue pickpocket heavily (and they should up the success rate so that in a
typical fight, a Rogue with a good PP skill can usually pick the mob dry),
will end up with an even coin distribution, rather than having to ML the
coin and distribute by hand at the end.  They can just autosplit via Rogue
and know it is fair.

However, there is a problem with this...the splitting of coins to get an
even distribution will make the loot skewed more toward copper, silver, and
gold.  Not nice.  So, to fix that, here is item 3.

3.  Make it so when the Rogue pickpockets from a red mob, after the loot is
autosplit, the coin of everyone in the group is normalized.  For example, if
you have 1p 50g 212s 134c, it gets converted to 8p 2g 5s 4c.

No more destroying all the annoying copper, silver, and in some cases even
gold, if you've got a Rogue.  Just take the occasional red mob.  I put in
the red requirement so that you can't just pickpocket a low green to get the
normalization effect.
