This is the only reason I have seen *not* to /petition names.

I have only /petitioned about 8 names.  All were vulgar or drug references
(IIRC Beegkok, Bongk Smogke, Tueezy, plus a couple more), 1 Lovecraft Elder
God or just truly annoying (Whenfreedomcals).

I respect Lokari's decision in this.  If you have a name against naming
convention, be aware it could be changed.  I had Cadfail changed on me (even
though it is, arguably, not from *popular* literature).  I accepted it and
went on.  I knew it could happen and it did.  Big Deal.
