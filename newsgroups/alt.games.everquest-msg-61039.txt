It is interesting, because although I started in Freeport and EC I couldn't
stand that place and left for Gfay quite early, also in search of a
fletching kit.  And I absolutely loved the place.  Sure, I didn't know where
I was going necessarily to start with but I soon learnt.  I still call
Kelethin my second home, and as for navigating the platforms I have only
fallen off I think twice ever.  It really depends whether you like wide open
spaces or a forest that you have to navigate a bit more in.  Personally I
think Gfay teaches you how to find your way a lot better - useful for later
on when you need some of those skills in exploring zones or in a dungeon.
