Thanks for pointing that out Clydefrog. I do want everyone to like me so 
I guess I better do that. But is there any way to play how everyone else 
wants me to play and make them all happy when they all have different 
ideas about how I should play? I mean I want to be liked and all but it 
seems impossible to have everyone like me. And then there is the issue 
of having fun myself. I do want to have some fun if I can.
