Whoever told you that is talking through his hat, Guide, GM, or
whatever.

Rule 10 - Fantasy-oriented names that are easily recognized from
popular existing media (e.g. Merlin, Gandalf, Belgarath, Drizzt,
Tanis). 

Very first note after the 11 naming rules:

For all of the above, misspellings and alternative spellings of the
word or words are also unacceptable.


The basic *real* rule is that they don't give a damn anymore.  They've
spent so long ignoring the naming rules that they have 25% of the
population illegally named, and they're not going to rock the boat by
cracking down.

I recently had a Guide tell me that a blatantly illegal name might
make it through because the person's had it so long that they've
gotten to Level 48.  Anybody here know how long it takes now
(dedicated) to get to L 48?  I'd guess under 3 weeks real time.
