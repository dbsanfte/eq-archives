The cleric isn't mine... the 20 Wiz is my highest character. I think I'll
wait till 24 or 30 to attempt the quest. I think two level 30's can take the
AC down. Perhaps we'll try it late at night when the camps may be a little
less populated. Staff of the wheel needs to wait until at least 24, as I
only have three ports at level 20.
