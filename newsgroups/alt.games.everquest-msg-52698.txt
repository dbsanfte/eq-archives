1. Don't compare yourself or your abilities to a twinked player. You
will only end up frustrated. A fully twinked Necro will have a lot
more mana and HPs. Other than that they cast the same spells and have
the same skills as you. At 23 that other Necro may seem like a god to
you, but by level 30 most "Twinks" are not much better off than a
start from scratch player. The only exceptions are Uber-Twinks born
with lvl50+ gear. 

2. As a necro I would recommend you look for items that boost the
following....
A. INT (obviously)
B. Mana (obviously)
C. *HPs 

*Necros can regen mana at a much faster rate by trading in their HPs.
Get yourself a couple of 4/45 (Cheapest and easiest to commision from
a jeweler), 5/55, or 6/65 rings when you can afford them. This will
give you a lot of "breathing" room when trading in HPs for Mana.

3. Enjoy your time as a "Start from Scratch" player. You will only
have to do it one time (if you stay on the same server). After that
you will most likely find yourself twinkning your own Alt characters.
Then you will be the envy of the "Start from Scratch" players your
twink will run across :-)

Cheers
