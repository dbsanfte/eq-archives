Damn.
Did not know I was this popular.
I went away for the weekend after saying I was not going to
bother DT anymore, and when I check back I see all this going on.
I could only read through about half of the 256 parts of this thread.
I think Sword has made some very good points, but face it Sword, these
people don't want to hear it.

And as for Dark Tygar, well, =)

Anyways to keep this on topic of EQ, what does everyone thing of the
new character model of the high elf female.
I think she looks like she has a little bit of ugly ogre in her.

Hiya DTygar.. =)
