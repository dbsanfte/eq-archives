Yes I do, however, my other spells report the effect on cast time; cast
time 3.0, your cast time 2.7; like that.  Since Cannabalize says cast
time 1.4, I figured it was unaffected.

Also, aren't spells under 3 second cast time immune to changes in cast
time?  Or is that just from BOR and not from item spell haste?  Or did
they change it or perhaps it never was that way and I'm just
hallucinating.
