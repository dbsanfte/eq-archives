I'd say 4 Necros, 1 bard, 1 druid.

No other class in the game can touch a Necros DoTs.
Druid for regen and some 2nd class DoTs. Bards have
mana and health regen for the casters and they have some
wicked DoT spells.

Plus if root don't stick you have 4 pets and fear spells.
This group would tear through some BIG mobs fast.
