It's a troubled, perhaps feeling somewhat guilty mother grieving
over the loss of her son, and no doubt sincerely hoping the publicity
could prevent another mother from experiencing the same thing.

The fact you can so easily dismiss _her_ loss says more about your
lack of compassion than the correctness or incorrectness of her
position. 

You're bored of the story--she lives the rest of her life without her son, 
wondering what she did wrong and if there's anything she should have 
seen or done which could have prevented his suicide.

Seems to me the only ' ridiculous ' position is yours. All you have to do
is ignore it--she lives it every hour of her life.
