Um, maybe you mis understand... The question was:
Why is an SK better than a Monk at pulling?
Monks can FD. 
Heck monks FD can be used while running, but I do belive that SK's
have an AA that allows them to do this as well.
Bards as well get a song that has similar effects of FD, but that
comes later in life I belive.
