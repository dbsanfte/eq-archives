OK, I can buy that one too.  I'm know my wizard doesn't have a taunt skill,
nor is he likely to. ;-)  I'm more of an arms length (or much, much farther)
kind of guy.  At level 14, root'n'nuke is about all I got.  I don't have
anything to buff other characters, other than bind, and with soulbinders in
every town, that's pretty much nerfed to hell.  Useful for me.  I can gate,
but I don't think I get an Evacuate spell or non-self gate spell until at
least 18 or 20.  I do have cancel magic, but I haven't had a chance to group
since I got it.  I just started memorizing it instead of ShadowStep.  Does
it kill the good spells as well as the bad?  I guess I'll have to try it out
on myself and see.

Cheers,
Eric
