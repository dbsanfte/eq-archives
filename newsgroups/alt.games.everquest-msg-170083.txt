I said "Spoilers Galore", now get lost!

YAY for a just-as-good second movie :D Although I've got to reread the 
book, I have a suspicion they changed a lot more in this installment 
than they did in the first.  Only thing that REALLY annoyed me was that 
they stopped the movie before Saruman and Wormtongue got theirs, dammit.

The Ents were WAY cool.  I was very much afraid that they'd be too 
cartoony, or something, but they did a really, really, REALLY good job 
on them - the battle at Isengard was especially nifty.

And speaking of battles - the Helm's Deep battle was just beautiful 
(except for one particularly annoying 'surf down the stairs' scene by 
Legolas - blah..).  Gollum - odded out by him at first, as he 
*definitely* had a different 'feel' than the rest of the characters, but 
they did do a really great job on him, specifically the interaction 
between him, Frodo, and Sam.  Didn't like the first scene of him arguing 
with himself, where they tried to make it look like there were two of 
him sitting there.

Didn't like the Arwen scenes but then, didn't like em in LOTR either.  
Liv Tyler annoys me, though, so it may be just me.

Definitely will be going to see this again.  Not sure if I'll make it to 
8 like the last one - I'm kind of unhappy that I read the book first - 
with FotR, I didn't know anything going in, and I just couldn't be as 
suspense filled knowing what happened.

But oh GOD, having to wait another year to see Eowyn kick ass... *sob*
