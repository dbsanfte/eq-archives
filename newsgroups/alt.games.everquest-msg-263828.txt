Now, see? You were doing ok in making your case until you stooped to 
insults. I've just been reading along, hearing both sides, but I now view 
you as the one who started the mud-slinging, thereby discrediting yourself 
and subscribing to the same level of intolerance of which you accuse 
others.

Your comments now tainted as they are, it's much easier for me to view this 
as merely a really cheap tactic. Newsflash: the vast majority of us post 
under an alias. How is posting under your actual name much different? Do 
you live next door to me or something? Your name gives me little more 
information on you than an alias might.

Personally, my alias is from the name of my very first (ok, technically 
second) main EQ character. It makes perfect sense and doesn't indicate any 
deceit on my part...honest.
