Did you even read what you just wrote? Who the heck else do you blame for
bad genetics other than the parents?

Definately not weak at all - I know that from first hand experience. I have
exactly the same conditions as my father and grandfather. I refuse to have
children for the very same reason. A lot of mental illnesses tend to have a
genetic link which should not be ignored. There is also strong enviromental
effects which "stacks" as well - Little Johnny Jr grows up in a
dysfunctional household because of nutcase Little Johhny Sr.

Humans are not above the laws of nature, the same genetic principles that
affect the characteristics of animals and plants govern us also. Mother
nature, in case you haven't already noticed, doesn't give a flying f*ck
about political correctness.
