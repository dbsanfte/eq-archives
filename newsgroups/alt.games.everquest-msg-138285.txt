I'd say if you're not lacking in any skills you need, hang on to them.
You never know what new skill or twist on an old skill may come along
later.

If you're wanting to spend them, I have found tradeskills to be quite
enjoyable. Baking is particularly nice, allowing you to bake your own
food and with stats when you are skilled enough. It's also nice to
tailor a full suit of patchwork and drop it on a newb.
