Recently I joined a new guild.  Last night we went to do the Avatar of War,
which was a pretty exciting thing for me.  We took down the idol just fine,
but we had real problems with the AoW.  The problem: weird lag.

I don't think it was client-side lag.  I have a DSL modem with no connection
problems ever... but there were times during the AoW fight that I would
target someone, and fifteen seconds later I'd finally get the target.  I'd
try to cast a spell... and it would be fifteen seconds before the spell
timer actually began.

We had 13 clerics healing the main tank as well as a druid-only healing
chain.  With that much healing it should be physically impossible for the
tank to die.  =)  And yet, there were these strange lag spikes where no
heals would land - but tank would still take damage and die.  Twice we
tried.  First time we got the AoW to twenty percent.  The second time he
barely dipped below 50.

Immediately everyone began blaming the clerics.  I can understand - it
shouldn't be possible for us to lose the tanks with that many folks healing
them.  But I can personally say there was nothing more I could have done - I
did heals as required, but when there's that much of a lag, I can't control
the timing.  And there were those weird spikes where no heals appeared to
land at all.

Has anyone else experienced anything like that?  How does your guild set up
to overcome lag issues of that nature?

I'm anxious to know, because it sucks being blamed for something when you
think you did everything as best you could.  =)  I don't see what we could
have done differently, but I'm *very* open to suggestions.

Thanks.
