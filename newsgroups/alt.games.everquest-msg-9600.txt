If you want to go to the best philosophers, you would stick with most of the
asian ones.  Many of the early european philosophers did had many ideas that
to me are totally worthless.  Thinks such as fire is basic element, ether is
the basis of life n such.  While they had a lot of ideas that were
interesting, they had just as many or more ideas that were just ludicrous.
Of course my favorite "philosopher" was Machiavelli, because what he wrote
about was more than just ideas, and could be used as a basis of living if
one wanted to.
