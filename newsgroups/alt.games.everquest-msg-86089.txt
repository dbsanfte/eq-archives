Thank you for proving my point.

Please name any raids which fall under your "I'm talking about MOST
raids, not specific ones." where enchanters are "danged near the top of
the desired list"

In thinking enchanters (one of the classes for least need for more than
2 on a raid) are top of the desired list for raids (or even groups post
55), you have proved you don't know what is required on major raids. It
has nothing to do with your guildtag, it has everything to do with
wrongly complaining about situations you have no experience in.

After you have 3-4 warriors as a safety margin, what role do warriors
play on a raid? If they aren't actually tanking at the time, they're far
better replaced by rogues, monks, rangers, or other classes who actually
do significant amounts of damage. ONE Warrior tanks - for 3 minute
bursts.

>>"You only need cleric, shaman, druid and enchanter buffs to cover the
gamit."

>>"They aren't essential, and that's what this subthread is about.  Lots
of warriors, clerics, ONE enchanter, ONE shaman and ONE monk are
"essential.""

So, with no paladins, your entire raid has 210 less hps per person?
Every CH is 210hps less effective, and your tanks are 210hps closer to
death? With no rangers, they lose the added ATK from pred. No bards? Oh
well, that's no manasong for the clerics (and all other casters if you
let them show up) and no above-cap haste for the tanks. That one enc is
gonna have a hard time keeping tricksters and HorriVis on the MT, as
well pre-buffing KIE on all casters, and clicking SotS on all tanks
(assuming none prefer VOG of course). Necros just dump mana I assume?
What about all those awesome taps and buffs they contribute? Wizzies
crit nuking for obscene amounts, and mages nuking and dropping rods.
That shaman will be dead in seconds from Mala, so who will slow? OK, he
gets lucky somehow on Mala, and gets to slow too before getting
instakilled, that's no torpor for casters on the AE. Oh wait, there's no
casters anyway, right? One monk? Heh, one monk isn't gonna be pulling
very much, and who do you send for his corpse every 5 minutes?
etc...etc...etc...

Your opinion means squat because it's completely WRONG, and obviously
based on no experience of the subject. Playing the poor regular guy
looked down upon by the evil uberguild snob isn't gonna change the
facts, or hide your lack of knowledge.
