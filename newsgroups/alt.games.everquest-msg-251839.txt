In case anybody missed it. The explanation (from the devs) is that
when you fish, the game checks for the surface of the water from the
ocean/river bottom. If it doesn't detect a water surface [interface?]
then it concludes you are fishing on land, hence the message about
land sharks.

Problem is that the game only checked upwards 100 units from the
bottom and the Abysmal Sea is deeper than that. Hence, the game
doesn't see the water interface.

How that happened I haven't a clue. It worked before. Supposed to work
with another patch or something.
