From my bazaar mule experience the only thing that pushes
the trader into the multiple phase is time.  The more time you
are in trader mode the more likely your items will show up
with a multiple number next to them.
When they don't show up as multiples (>1) then usually
it shows all 8 in the window (as (1)).
Maybe that's changed.
If you end and restart trader that seems to reset (more often
than not) the stacking of non-stackable items.

ps. There is a possibility that you can search for your own
items that show up unstacked and that may cause the system
to update the status to be stacked, on future searches, if you
do not leave trader mode.
