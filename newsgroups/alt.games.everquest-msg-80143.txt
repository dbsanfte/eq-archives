I have grouped in maidens eye 3 times know, each time it has been a letdown.
I am drawn there because of the loot.
Every time I have gone to Maidens eye, either the puller got adds or we were
attacked by a wanderer.  Either way somone in the party  died.

       It was the smae pattern over again and over again. We would kill 4 or
5 in a row and looked like we were developing a rhytum and then suddenly
there were 2 or 3 mobs and somones health bar went to zero.  I am a level 56
Paladin so I rarely died. But the downtime looking for rezes and getting
started up again made all three times I went to Maidens rather unproductive.
3 1/3 hours for a single blue bulb.

      For some reason the pickup groups I joined all wanted to camp the
hills on each side of the DS zone.
I am thinking there has to be better safer spots to camp in the zone.

      What is your expereince.  Where are the better safer camp spots. As a
Paladin I have some pretty effective spells against the undead, I would like
to maybe kill Vampyres at the Vamp camp on the right.  People were telling
me the Vampyres there are 2 dangerous for a party of 6 between 51 and 56. I
have heard both pro and con about camping outside the Akheva ruins zone.

Any helpwould be appreciated.

Also, Anyone know what drops have been nerfed?
