Ok, first of all, I have to say that there's a fine line between bravery
and insanity. You seem to have wound that line up into a ball of twine
and flushed it. ;-)

Amazing that you made that trip. What made you not decide to just do
three zones into DL and try to sneak your way to the hidden valley?

That said, your method wouldn't work as well for me because we are doing
it for differnt reasons. You were apparently ready to leave the Cabilis
area sime-permanently and move your bind point. I, OTOH, am only looking
to make a one time trip to acquire new weapons and make it back to Cab
without losing my life savings. The lack of any banking facilities near
the FP area that a young lizard can use just makes that impractical.
That's why I like the GFey option better. Banking in the bazaar, nexus
portal to the GFey spires, nothing much to bother me by those spires
while I trade, ability to shop for new bank containers in bazaar, etc.
It's all good. I just can't see me trying to make my way to E. Commons
with all my worldly wealth on me. :-(

That said, when I get the cash ready (another hundred plat or so to go)
I think I'm going to try the LoIO, FM, DL route to get to the Nexus
Scion there. If I get smoked too badly, perhaps I'll try yours just for
the audacity of it.
