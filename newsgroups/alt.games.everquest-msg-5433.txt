Best advice for LOIO hunters: Leave the Lake of Ill Omen.  Run away
from this overcrowded, d00de infested, train prone hellhole as fast as
you can, and don't look back. 

Now, that' being said, you're level 17 and bound to the OT outpost,
right? The area from the left of the outpost and to the road to
Warliks Woods will be heaven to you, there's plenty of stuff to hunt,
there's a guard station within running distance, and you can
buy/sell/bank with ease.  It's very much like being low level again
and hunting the batyards.

This area will carry you to around 23 or so, during which you can move
on to Warliks Woods, Dalnir, or Frontier Mountian.
