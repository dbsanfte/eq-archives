   Maybe EQ has _saved_ my life, have you thought of 
that?  
    If I didn't play EQ as much as I do, I would 
probably do the other thing that I enjoy...no, that
I love.  Namely, driving.  Like a maniac.  Hands
up from everyone who's ever had the heady pleasure 
of driving in San Diego.  Ok, it's not quite as 
dangerous as running through Kith Forest at night,
but come close.  Half the drivers are maniacs, and
the other half go at timid little old lady speeds.
And it is FUN.
   I'll probably die behind the wheel, trying to
overtake at 65 a chevy doing 25 in a 35 zone.  But
it might take longer, if I spend less time on the
road and more on Drinal.
   So.... play more EQ!  To save your life!
