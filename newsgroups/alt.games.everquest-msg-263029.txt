No, it's different.

If a wizard leaves PoK without KEI, they can still do what they set out to
do, but slower.

There is a definite point at which a tank needs a certain amount of HP / AC
/ AA to be of any use to a group in terms of achieving their goals.

The same is true of clerics, but that point comes much, much earlier, and
is so obvious that no one would ever think to ask 'did you buy complete
healing'?  But would you take a cleric into a group if they hadn't?

No one is suggesting that only tanks need to have certain requisites to
make a group viable, but I am suggesting that one of the easiest things to
measure and make an evaluation on, are HP/AC/AA of your tank, and hence
people tend to ask.

If wizards don't have every nuke, they're still doing DPS, and it won't
break your group instantly on the first pull.

Lastly, it must help clerics to know before the first mob arrives how
quickly the tank is going to drop to 30% health or whatever?  You can be
level 70 with 6k hitpoints, and you can be level 70 with 12k hitpoints.
Which of the two ends you're at affect a great deal about the arrival of
the first mob.

When my warrior joins a group, I tell the cleric how many hitpoints I have.
When I get group invites for places where I know I take a lot of damage due
to low AA, I tell the group and make sure they're aware before I join.

If you're doing traditional tank-grouping (i.e. someone gets hit and holds
aggro, someone heals them), then the lynch-pin in that group is the tank.
They have to survive the initial assault long enough for the rest of the
group to act, and knowing how long you have is very useful.
