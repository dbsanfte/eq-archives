D2 is less likely to draw off large numbers of people due to its nature,
but I can effortlessly see someone playing WW2OL, and quitting EQ.

>but has FORCED PVP.

Err, not really. The PvP element is a large one, but it is not forced. Huge
portions of the gameworld are unreachable by opposing teams (and not just
newbie areas either).

>AO looks like it may have forced PvP but besides that it looks interesting
>Shadowbane (assuming it's ever released) will be forced PvP

Yea, both of these look to be developed for PvP to the exclusion of most
everything else.

It could very easily let me say goodbye to everquest. No, it isn't
persistant (Usually...there are some world sites out there that have some
promising ideas)...but it has a lot of advantages:
1) You know the game rules...nothing is ambigious
2) You can develop your own content if you want
3) If you don't like how a server admin is running his site..go to another
one
4) Balance...as in: NWN will have some.
5) Character vault allows for protected unhackable (at least, hopefully
they are unhackable) characters, and server DMs can block all non-vault
characters, which prevents some hex-edited superman from screwing up your
game if you don't want it.

Yea, the main competition for EQ will be another game with zero PvP (or
by-choice duels, like EQ has). It will take one or two (or three or four)
of these newer games folding before game companies realize that just
because Quake, Unreal, and Starcraft are popular head-to-head games against
live opponents, their RPG version won't automatically be a success.

The nature of the games is just so fundamentally different. However, while
none of these games...and even all of them together...are not going to
spell the doom of EQ, they *will* siphon off some of the playerbase.
