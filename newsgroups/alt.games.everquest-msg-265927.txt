3d mark is intentionally designed to mainly stress the graphics card. 
Going from an AMD 2400XP with an ATI Radeon 9600 Pro in an AGP 4x slot 
to an Intel P4 3.2ghz with a piece of shit OEM made Radeon x600XT (it a) 
uses slower ram than anything in the x### line that ATI makes, b) is 
clocked as slow as a 9600, non pro, c) doesn't have the thermal sensor 
for auto overclocking, and d) has a heat sink that would be touch and go 
on a Pentium 200, which is riveted through the board.) in a PCI-Express 
slot my 3d-mark scores went down about 5%. Using Vana'diel bench (the 
Final Fantasy 'how will your computer do' software), my scores went up 
around 35%, and I can run Fraps doing video captures and lose only 1-3 
FPS rather than cutting my FPS in half or more.
