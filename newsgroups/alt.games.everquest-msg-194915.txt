    I wish my smithing was up high. I see all the Tae Ew bloods in the
Bazaar, and the 14 Iksar bloods I have in the bank, and just wince at how
much money could be made. Hopefully sometime soon I'll get some time to
raise it. I have a +15% mod item, so I can take the PoP shortcut, too.
(Current unmodified skill of 181)

    These mobs are intended to be one-groupable. Too bad some of what they
drop isn't so hot, and it's all No Drop.

    Amazingly stupid move. He cannot get healed by someone outside the
water, so he has to wait on someone to come in or he's gonna get wasted.

    It's the blue-white mace thing, isn't it? Looks kinda nice, which makes
up for the asstastic stats. The "no resists" is what kills that thing - slap
20 FR on it and it doesn't look too bad. You'll have to parse it sometime
versus the Hammer of Damnation - I'm convinced the Hammer could outdamage
it.

    Yeah, that mace is actually about the least impressive drop off the mini
nameds. Other CLR loot I can think of off minis includes a 75 HP/95 MANA FT
II earring and an 85 HP/MANA FT III belt. Better than the Coral Mace, if
only because of the stats.

    I'm at 106 right now. Have a large work-in-process inventory awaiting
final pieces, though, like a few Robes of Haunted Dreams, one of those Wood
Elf illusion quest cloaks, and the big one, Plane of Earth silk leggings.
50/50 shot on those legs, which will sell fast at 100 K if I get lucky when
I click "combine". Considering I've blown two Fire silk combines for
personal sale, I'm due. ;-)

    I'd do that and replace one of my lamer bags, like the Dusty
Ransacker's, but I'm just too cheap. It's also such a hassle to transfer
items to the alts, and I'd have to move the old bag to one of them. Yeah,
poor little rich cleric!
