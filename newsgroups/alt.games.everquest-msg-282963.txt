they *are* drugs ... people get addicted... the game works fine without

this is why i'm jumping in - tofs - no one is keyed for tofs =)

you just have to walk on in and fight the spectres and gnolls that want to
throw you out before you find the key to the next level ...

i won't ruin any surprises for you, but after figuring out all the juicy
lore and traps and managing to get a key per level (1 key will port 1 group
up to the next level), you will find yourself in a hunting ground that might
be perfect for yourself

i mention this all because it's all about "going the long way around" to
progress through this classic dungeon

and don't quit until you get to the wedding =)
