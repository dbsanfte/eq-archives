Yeah its a convenient way to make a list of a char you've not entered
stuff into magelo for yet. It saves to a txt file your characters
slots in a certain order starting with the stuff you have equipped,
then the stuff in your inventory, then the stuff in your bank. So its
nice to have while you enter in your chars items. 

It also doesn't access the internet at all except to check for an
update. You can verify that with zone alarm or some other internet
permission firewall and a program that plays eq in a window, if
paranoid.

I wonder how he found out how to get the thing to do what it does.
One cool feature, though, would be if since its making this text file
anyway if you could then upload the text file to the char creation
area on magelo so you would not have to enter in the location of all
your equipment manually... that can take some time. You can't even use
the codes from the text file on the actual equipment screen, only on
the inventory items screen. This seems kind of backwards. You have to
scroll down a list of all the items in EQ on every inventory slot you
are equipping.
