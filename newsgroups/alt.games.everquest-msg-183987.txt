Is it?  I saw no humor in it at all.

Ah... gotta love those people who, knowing nothing about me, pass judgment
on my life.

Last Saturday in Minneapolis is was a clear, bright, sunny day.  I played
EQ, so by your definition I must be a loser.  Oh, it was also hovering
around zero degrees Fahrenheit, or twenty below Celsius.  Still, I chose to
remain inside, so I must be a loser.

I have a good friend who is suffering from liver failure, amongst other
health problems.  She is often bedridden.  Despite the fact that it is a
bright sunny day, she stays inside and plays EQ.  Clearly a loser by your
definition.

Or... I could simply decide that, between choosing to go out for a walk when
it's warm and breezy and staying inside to try our first Rallos Zek kill, I
decide to play EQ.  That's my choice, and I live with it, and in no way
think I'm a loser, nor do those close to me think of me as a loser.

So keep your pithy judgments to yourself.  I like who I am.  Deal with it.
