Haha.  You are the very first person I have ever heard use the "4 year old"
insult.  You are also the first person I have ever seen claim to be a system
admin -- aware, I'm sure, that such a claim would be difficult to prove or
disprove under the circumstances, but apparently unaware that most of the
people here probably couldn't give a damn anyway.

I wouldn't give this advice to most people, but for you, I think
extraordinary measures are in order.  The next time you think you have
something witty to say, go say it in the mirror a couple of times and really
listen to how it sounds.  But you have to promise that when reality sets in,
you're not going to climb out on a window ledge or anything silly like that.
