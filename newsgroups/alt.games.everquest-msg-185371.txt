    You underestimate their ability to block folks. ;-)

    If you can name another server with three elemental plane guilds, I'd be
interested. Right now from what we've seen all the other servers have one or
two elemental guilds. Given the three day repop on elemental nameds, two
guilds can peacefully co-exist - two days to clear all elemental stuff, then
one day of "other" raids. We have four elemental guilds, so after day one
the planes are cleared and there's two days of four guilds trying to get
what they can, where they can. It's VERY top-heavy.

    There will be fight for high-end content, I don't doubt that. But what
is currently highest-end, the elemental planes, I don't see being contested
unless a guild on one of those two-guild servers stupidly moves over
thinking they'll be the new number one.
