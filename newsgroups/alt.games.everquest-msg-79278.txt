That's what I meant.  Still cheeses me off when ANY epic is called
"easy."  "Easy" to me implies going after level 50+ spell drops on Seb Jugs
with 30 people :-).  "Easy" to me implies killing the General when he's
all alone with 40+ people all level 50+.  "Easy" is not when you've
got 20 dedicated folks that have never done or helped with the
General before.  "Easy" is a group of 14 55's taking down the dragon that
the Shaman solo'd in WW.  "Not easy" was the shaman soloing him :-).

Hell, if you've got 36 people level 60 that have been farming Sleeper's
long enough to get everybody their primals and such, waking the
Sleeper is "easy."
