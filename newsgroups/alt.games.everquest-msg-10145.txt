Don't start with fish rolls, they fail too much at low skill

Batwing crunchies (Bat wing + frosting) to 46
Fish fillet (Fresh Fish + Jug of sauces) to 82 (one fish + one jug of sauces
yields 2 fillets too)
THEN fish rolls to 135
After that, you have to make stuff that takes (semi)-rare ingredients
(brownie parts) or baking utensils that are relatively hard to get (for me
at least, I still need a pie tin, muffin tin and cake round)

beetle eye pie is trivial at 142, (clump of dough, fire beetle eye, spices
and reusable pie tin, yields 5)
berry pie is also trivial at 142, (clump of dough, berries and reusable pie
tin, yields 2)
Birthday cake is trivial at 162, (Winter chocolate, Frosting, clump of dough
and reusable cake round, yields 2)
chocolate cookies are trivial at 148, (clump of dough, spices, frosting,
winter chocolate, yields 2)
fruit pie is trivial at 142, (clump of dough, fruit and reusable pie tin,
yields 3)
meat pie is trivial at 142, (clump of dough, chunk of meat and reusable pie
tin, yields 3)

uggg, tired of typing, you can find the recipes on www.eqtraders.com

just don't forget to keep brownie parts for the winter chocolate or white
chocolate;
Winter chocolate is trivial at 109 ( 2 frostings and 1 brownie parts, made
in MIXING BOWL, not spit/oven, yields 1)
White chocolate is trivial at ~113 (2 frostings,1 brownie parts and spices,
made in MIXING BOWL, not spit/oven, yields 1)

My baking skill is up to 120 right now, i just got sick of baking 20 stacks
of food to up skill
But I did make 50pp for making a backpack full of batwing crunchies for a
guys party once.

Good luck to all my fellow bakers!
