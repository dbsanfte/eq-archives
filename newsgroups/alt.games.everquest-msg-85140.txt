Precisely my point.  

And the barbs are rare drops.  I can spend 3 hours getting 3 barbs,
spend an hour running around gathering components, then combine and
hope for 1 or 2 successes. 

Then I can spend 5 or so hours in north freeport saying "/auc Geerlok
Sewing Contraption - 2000pp" and maybe sell one of 'em. 


The alternative to all this is get in a good XP group in sebelis and
make twice the cash of gem drops in half the time.  


It's nice that there's a cheaper alternative to skilling up on
rebreathers and clockwork orange... err.. i mean armor.  But these
aren't the instant horse fund I had hoped they would be. :-)
