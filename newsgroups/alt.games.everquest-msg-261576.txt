    Illusions might not help. Iksar are all worshippers of Cazic Thule, so
even with a good race illusion they'll get squashed in FV. Not sure what
mobs see through invis/ITU on the way to the docks, but there's mobs near
the docks that could easily wipe out a low-level Iksar before the
translocators port them (no idea why they put in that delay). Don't bother
considering what other non-Iksar can cast on them, as if you had access to
non-Iksar you could just port them out of Kunark.

    Getting to the Dreadlands spires as a low level Iksar warrior would be
one hell of a trip.

    As an evil race that must worship an evil god, Iksar take forever to
faction with FV. My monk killed every goblin he saw, and never got out of
scowls.
