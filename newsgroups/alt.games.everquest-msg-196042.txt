Shaman are overpowered.  I play an enchanter and I love my character, but
shaman out perform me hands down.  Why?  Speed caps, with haste items most
people in the higher end game reach the max with my 2nd best spell (AQ).
Shaman and chanters can slow and haste.  Shaman can heal, chanters can mez,
but why mez when you can root park?  Shaman can wear heavy armor.
Enchanters have the lowest hp's in the game.  Canni, don't get me
started....Shamans are overpowered.  They are thee most powerful classs in
the game overall.  Hurry and level before they get nerfed.
