Heh. I've done network support for Macs too, and I would agree on that 
point. I was thinking more in terms of the new MacOSX, which I haven't had 
the chance to use yet (it was a choice between a Mac and a Luclin-capable 
PC, the last time I had that much money to spare), but the combination of an 
Apple-designed interface and proper UNIX underneath seems hard to beat, and 
the people I know who use it have nothing but praise for it.
