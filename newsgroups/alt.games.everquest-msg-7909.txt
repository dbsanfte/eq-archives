Actually, on my server, Karana, my guilds 50+ people LIKE to do quests
like this, because it is FUN.
It helps out those that need the item, and it gives the guild
something to do together as a team.
We enjoy playing together, and this is a realtively easy thing to do,
and it is fairly safe. Sure, we could go raid the Hole, or something
else, but this is a fight that we can trigger when we want, and not
need to worry about waiting our turn in line.
