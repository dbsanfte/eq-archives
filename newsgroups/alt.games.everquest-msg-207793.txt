I'm forced to disagree here, I can't think of any spawns meeting that 
description on the cleric epic.

Lord Bergurgle is a simple camp, rare spawn on an 18 minute timer, so 
while it may take many hours of camping, the camping doesn't have to be 
continuous and really isnt' that big a deal.  Grimmie is similar, 
another rare spawn on a roughly 15 minute timer (I forget the actual 
duration but its on that order, similar to Bergurgle's).  In both cases, 
you zone in, check to see if he's camped, if not, kill, rest, kill, 
rest, kill, rest; eventually up the mob pops.  And its rumored that they 
always pop after a patch, so another route is just to camp out where you 
can check to see if someone beat you to them.  I don't think either of 
these compare to say a Pegasus Cloak (rare drop off a rare spawn that 
appears at random in the zone so you can't even camp him on purpose... 
now rare times rare times hard to find, -that's- insanely rare!)

 From that point on, there are no rare spawns involved at all, plasmatic 
priest and trigger for Ixiblat are up 12 of every 24 game hours and 
spawn once a norrath day  (no PH mind you, they simply spawn), and the 
Ixi trigger (if you are careful and quick) can be used several times in 
a row.  The Overking in chardok spawns every 2 hours, again, no PH 
involved.    Then you have to collect rare drop shards in Skyfire, but 
while the drops are rare the mobs that drop them are extremely common, 
even at its hieght I never saw a lack of mobs to kill in SF, not with 
over 175 people killing there all at once.  Finally you have the warder 
cecilia, trigger for ragefire, she is on a 20 minute timer with no PH
