Only 60k?  When I see them on Lanys, they're in the 150k range.  Since
I just spent the majority of my life savings on CoTAM (and then got to
play with it the following day and my charm pet did 89k in 3minutes to
Chaoswind :)  It was worth the cash)

Is Silent Redemption your guild?  I'll have to check it out.

Shoot, if we have 12-18 people on in the morning, we make a mini raid
and hit a few targets.  We manage to get some decent gear into the guild
that way, and we're forming a core of raiders who are just a tad more
disciplined and capable of pulling off tough fights than the main force.

Although, if I see another Mantle of the Raincaller rot while my BL is
too low to get in to it, I'll cry :-P
