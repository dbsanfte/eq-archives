In a word... NO.    The vast majority of them just don't make sense..
Brells is a giant sized love heart.. lol.  Regen and a few other things, 3-4
blue love hearts.. I mean wtf is that all about?

KEI has the old illusions icon.. again no sense.  None of my shaman buffs
make sense (group focus, group sta)

I like the CoP one but thats about it.

My spell bug is a real big mess now too, I spend 10 minutes sifting through
the pages looking for Invis, EB, Root, my pet (shaman) or trying to find
rez/root/gate/bless of aego etc (cleric)

Guess i just need to get used to it all... I dont like change :(

Didnt the different coloured spells give you a little indication?   I
learned that before level 5
