Started a beastlord and i notice when several mobs are in camp I find it 
difficult to stay on the same mob as my pet.  I'd rather us both be on the 
same mob so we can take it down quicker together rather than us each be on a 
different one.  I set up a hotkey and did '/assist Preyying's Warder' but it 
will not work.  Is it possible to assist my pet?
