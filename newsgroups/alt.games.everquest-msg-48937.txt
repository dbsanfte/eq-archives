I had an interesting experience this past weekend,  my druid is finally
to 18,  really looking forward to 19  did 17 and 18 in 2 4 hour play
sessions  so while I want 19, I'm rather done with EK and needing to
think about cash for my 19 spells so I'm back in Lavastorm.  anyways,
I'm sitting by the Najena zone line, medding up for my next elemental
nukefest.  Anyways, Darkelf SK comes out with a semi-dewd "heal me,
pls"  I say "No."  What to my surprise I hear "Why won't you heal me, I
said Please."  I was completely shocked that this person was capable of
complete sentances.  So got into a discussion of why My Halfling druid
doesn't heal soloing evil darkelves, and how Please should complell me
to help. And something about racism and skin color that wasn't clear
either.

OK, I have tremendous admiration for someone who goes to the trouble of
learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
