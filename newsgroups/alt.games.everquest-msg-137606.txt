    Solid drops. Hopefully this'll convince your guild it's a worthwhile
target. Three day repop, BTW, and you can track the first mob from the
zone-in.

    The one you pulled is the only one not perma-rooted. I imagine now you
have all the other answers you need.

    You usually get slime repops when fighting on dry land anyways. Just not
all at once! It's good to kill them as they repop, though, to avoid
chain-aggro and a train like you mentioned.

    About the only thing that's challenging. ;-)
