I'm not sure if we will be able to transfer existing characters yet, it
seems to be a debate right now according to certain web sites. I live in the
UK, but I'm not sure I would move my chars to Antonius Bayle in any event,
even if we could take all equipment and money. If it was shown that the UK
server was much better for lag then I may consider it, but then I would need
Verant to allow moves after several months of the server going live, how
likely is that?
