First things first: disagreements over camps have nothing to do with
kill-stealing. Except for the second guy that stole one of your spawns
after you attacked it, nothing "illegal" happened here as far as the
guides etc are concerned. And I bet no guild will discipline a member
of ONE (arguably accidental) kill steal (a guide won't either for that
matter). Even if the guy gave you attitude. They'll just laugh at you.

You know, I would agree with you about this, if it was some kind of
special camp. For example last night we camped the jail in KC waiting
for that one human skeleton to spawn (part of a wizard quest for a
high level spell). VERY rare spawn. Now if that skel had finally
spawned and someone walked into the camp and killed it (before we got
a chance to do the turn in), I would have immediately /petitioned, and
hopefully sooner or later gotten a response. That would really have
been rude.

But in a generic camp like the one you were at (and let's face it,
Unrest is not exactly laid out such that there are "camps", you just
decided to kill in this area that had two rooms) i think it's almost
selfish to claim a section of a popular zone all to yourself.
Especially when you were by yourself, not in a 6 people group. That's
like someone claiming part of the HG hill in the Rathe Mountains. It
just ain't gonna happen. Contacting a guild may or may not get you a
response, but it may also give people a bad impression of you. If I
was a guild leader and someone came complaining about one member,
doing on KS in a crowded zone, my response would be to /ignore you for
a few days.

In fact I think that this is part of a "massive multiplayer"
environment. You have to interact with other people, even in
confrontations and solve problems. (And by solve I don't mean
/petition.. unless there is no other way.) If you don't like this
aspect of the game, maybe you should try something else.

On the other hand I will agree that there are zones like Dreadlands,
that definitely have camps, but they are set up such that almost
everybody pulls from a common pool of mobs.

Others like KC have clearly defined and separated camps. But even
there, people share mob pools. And usually noone cares if someone else
pulls a few mobs (happens all the time on accident anyways).

And offtopic, it would be nice if you posted some of you enjoyable
experiences here too.. not just the *I-need-to-let-of-steam*
experiences.

So in conclusion: 
-Yes KSing sucks and people who do it suck. BUT it happens on
accident. Just be nice about it and most people will respect that,
apologize and offer the loot. You'd be surprised how many people in
this game will be nice to you if you are nice (people love it you
throw in some roleplaying..)
-Not recognizing a camp is not KSing per se. Again, if you are nice to
people about it instead of screaming at them, they may just agree to
move on.
