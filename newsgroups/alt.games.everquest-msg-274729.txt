Agreed, the market isn't very tolerent of that, these days.  Both black and 
white would avoid such a place (even if it's just to avoid getting your 
tires slashed while you're inside from those who don't think too kindly apon 
the establishment's policies.

When I first got to this area, it wasn't uncommon to see signs that said 
"Sailors and dogs, keep off the grass."  Now days, such signs would be the 
death knell for whoever posted them.
