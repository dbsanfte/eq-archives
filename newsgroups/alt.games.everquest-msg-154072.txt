If you want to solo a pally throughout your career cool...do it.  Don't
bother looking up your epic quest though...or any other equipment you might
like but is no-drop.

If you decide to group later in your career, cool...do it.  But grow a thick
skin because you're going to be constantly given constructive criticism
about how to be a good group paladin...don't think you know all about what a
paladin is until you routinely LoH an enchanter or cleric moments before YOU
die.

There's nothing wrong with soloing but you're not learning everything you
can.  Which is cool, if that makes you happy.
