That's pretty much my opinion.  Was when I DM'ed, too. Of course, if someone
'loaned' something like a Rod of Lordly Might to a first level, there were
lots of fun ways to it not work as intended. <g>

Agreed.

LOL.  Also agreed.

And if I happen to group with some low level character who's twinked, and
should it start to get on my nerves, I can always find someone else to group
with.  It seems to me that Norrath is too big of a place to let one bonehead
ruin your night .. just go somewhere else for a while.

Just my opinion, of course ..... <g>
