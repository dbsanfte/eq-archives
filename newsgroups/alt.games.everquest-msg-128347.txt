I did this quest a while back and was also bummed by the time it took them
to spawn.  I was thrilled one day when I got two within an hour of each
other with hears on them.  I think it is just rotten luck.  Like I read when
I was working on it... "it seems it is a rare loot on a rare spawn."  They
were more frequent at night, but I was able to kill a few earlier or later
than most posts ahve plced them.
What I did is go to the far end of the path, just before a pixie camp if I
remember right.  Track for a while and if no results, back track along the
path.  My tracking was maxed at 125 so I could see a out a good distance.
They seem to have no set spawn location.  My guess is the wandering skellies
are place holders.  I even killed them right near the G fay zone and at the
Undead Spire.  There was talk of a relation with the undead spire, but I
found none.

No answer on the "Mouse" question.
