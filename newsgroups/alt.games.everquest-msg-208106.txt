-- I read something awhile back about "item decay" in SWG. Is this
something they've kept in the game?  Now that SWG has been out for
awhile can anyone who has been playing it say it's improving? Or is it
still too early to tell? And is SWG really that different from the
early levels of EQ as far as building up skills and levels? I haven't
seen it yet so I don't know if people are saying it really _doesn't_
feel like Star Wars or that they are disappointed that they can't
start as fully equipped Jedi, etc.....

Thanks,
-Robert.
