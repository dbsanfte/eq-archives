i.e. fitness is determined by survival, in effect rendering the phrase
"survival of the fittest" equivalent to "survival of the survivors".
Now can you see my point?

Again you are defining fitness in terms of survival, see above.

that do not equate to survival.  If you can do this, and I'm pretty
confident that you cannot, then you will have an effective refutation
of my statement.
