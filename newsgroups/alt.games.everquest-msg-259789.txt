    The fun of combat.  Granted, that means that you actually have to enjoy
the process of engaging in combat, and not be doing so in hopes of getting
stuff at the end.

   The problem with playing to get stuff, at least for me, is that if what
you are fighting doesn't drop the stuff you want, then you have to do the
fight again, even if the things you are fighting are green, give no
experience or challenge in the battle, until they do drop the stuff you
want.  True, when whatever you need does finally drop, there can be a sense
of elation, but to me that wasn't worth the time hours of boredom and
frustration I felt during the process of getting the stuff.

   I know that others feel differently than I do.  Heck, I felt differently
that I do for at least 3 1/2 years.  But after playing CoH, which is now my
game of choice, I don't really look forward to playing any game that has
stuff.
