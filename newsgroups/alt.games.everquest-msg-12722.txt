There's no fast way to make money. People who have been playing for months or
years will start low level characters that will have MUCH BETTER equipment
than you.

All servers are the same with regaurds to what you ask. If you are a
socialable person, then you will be able to find people to give advice (how
to earn money for armor & weapons, where can I hunt something besides bugs &
bats), group with, travel with, and what you mean by interact with. If not,
just like in RF, you will you not do so easily.

Pick the class and race that you think will be fun to play. If you don't like
your race's starting location, get to level 2 and go somewhere else.

Since you seem to want player interaction, the following classes tend to be
more popular in groups: Cleric, Shaman, Warrior, Shadow Knight, Monk, Rogue,
Enchanter, Bard.

Were you bored because the game was too difficult or because you were not
challenged?  The easiest class to play from the list is warrior. The toughest
classes to play from the list are Enchanter and Bard. 

If not having fancy armor and weapons was a big problem, Monks are probably
the least dependant on equipment.
