>> SoW potions trivial at skill 37.

Does trivial mean that every attempt is successful? I ask because I am at
level 42 in alchemy and when making SOW potions I hit only 3 out of 5
attempts !?! I actually have better success making Invis to Undead (3 out of
4 attempts) which is trivial at level 43.

This is weird. I wonder why this should be. Any thoughts on this?

Thank you.

Bob
