My main is a 57 gnome enchanter.  He gets annoyed easily.

What's the deal with "kk?"  When you TALK to someone do you SAY "kay kay"
when you mean "okay?"

I mean, I can understand (in fact, I use it) "k" because people SAY "'kay."

I've told my guildies that from now on, since 2 "k"s are good, 3 must be
even better! so I'll be typing "kkk" when I mean "okay."  Immediately 3
people pointed out the KKK reference, but our only (as far as I know) black
member didn't voice a complaint (he knew what I was saying, he wasn't going
to get upset because it happened to have the same letters...that'd be dumb).

BTW, when did the word "lag" gain a "g" making it "lagg???"  I see people
spell it that way ALL THE TIME now.  Before you newbie a.g.e users have a
cow and call me the Spelling Police or something, I'm talking about this
particular word, not the generally horrendous lack of spelling ability in
EQ.
