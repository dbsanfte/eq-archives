I can do a level a night, or every other night mid 20's on up.  You have to
get into a good, regular group that knows their role, and have to have a
puller that knows wheat they are doing.

The group I was in - had almost ZERO downtime, and almost constant fighting.
We had:

1 warrior
1 rogue
1 cleric
1 shaman
1 druid
1 pickup character.
