That was quick.  He's already assigned it to the circular file.  And 
he's written off EQ2 because of EQ(and SOE).  Something about the clunky 
interface, to which I agree with somewhat.  I still keep hitting W and 
sit there wondering why I'm not moving!

As for me?  I'll be around for a while. I've started several avatars of 
varying races/skills and for the most part am having fun killing 
'spiders' in all their various forms.  Although for the life of me I 
still can't get fishing to work.
