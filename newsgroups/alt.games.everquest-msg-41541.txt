Hehe, normally i dont bother to killfile anyone, but this guy cant even
troll properly or figure out to insult anyone.
At least some of the trolls in here can post stuff that can be funny or
interesting to read, this guy didnt even managed that.
Grats killem, your the first person that have been so utterly boring and
uninteresting that even your troll attempts arent even worth reading.
