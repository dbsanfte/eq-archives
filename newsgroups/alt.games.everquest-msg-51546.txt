I would say the 24 root helps big time.  I personally did alot from 24
to 30 fear kiting mammoths in everfrost.  Mammoths seem to have high
resistances.  Root and fear break early direct damage oft full/partially
resisted, etc.  Still Fear kiting was the way to go for me.  at 166
wisdom, i usually would end a fight with two blue bubs of mana left, and
by 30, i was doing two, and could probably have done a third if no
resists.  I have also done the root rot route.  I found it rather
effective on single static spawns the most.  Jonah in Lake Rathe, the
Hermit, etc.
