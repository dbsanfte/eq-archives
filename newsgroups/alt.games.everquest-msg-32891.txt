Take the time and write down all your gear and back-up gear then post it
here.  Save people the trouble of looking up the gear and include their
stats and weight.  Also, include your character's unbuffed overall stats and
empty weight (no summoned food or drink and nothing else except the empty
backpacks and back-up gear you normally carry ... don't include back-up gear
you normally store in the bank in the weight but do include in the list of
gear).  By you doing this, we can better advise you what you most need to
improve and can easily get at your level.

Given that you only have ~200 plat and presumably not bought your 24th level
spells yet, expect to hunt for your gear.
