On the off chance that you are not an absolute moron, ill give you some
advice.
EQ comes with a CD ket when you buy it from the shop. This key is used to
register, update your account, and is linked to your account. This means
that once a CD key is used, it can not be used again. Therefore, no one is
going to give you a key, thanks for coming.
