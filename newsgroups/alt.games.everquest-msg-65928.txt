just a warning.  dont buy the tnt2 cards. they are dead end 4 year old
technology now.  DO NOT BUY THEM.  for similar money you can if you
shop get a far far better card.  

Since you have to get a PCI card.  the best peforming one is probably
still the voodoo 5500.  but its not supported and if your running XP
or the newer direct x, you will have to search for the hacked drivers.

for supported PCI video cards you probably want a real Radeon ( not
the LE) with DDR mem. or a geforce 2 mx 400( preferably not the 200).
You probably are not going to gain much by going with a 64 meg card
over a 32 meg card,  and in some tests the added memory on a MX card
actually seemed to slightly diminish performance.

but just stay away from the tnt2 m64 cards, they were utter crap when
released, inferior to the real tnt2 cards on the market then, and
havent improved any since.  

go to www.pricewatch.com and check on prices.  the good PCI cards
carry a bit of a premium because alot of people are stuck with crappy
onboard video and want to upgrade to a decent card.
