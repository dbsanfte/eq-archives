I actually went back in time and altered history such that the
Internet, as we know it today, was available far earlier. I created an
account on Everquest in 1961, paid for a single month, then canceled
my account. I came back to the present and my characters were still
there - more 40 years later.

I then went back in time to just before the first time I went back in
time and stopped myself to re-align the timeline.
