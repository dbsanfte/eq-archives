Oddly, I *prefer* ISA over PCI.  If it weren't for the fact that it's slow
by comparison, I'd say it's the ideal card interface, simply because you
need to set each card's IRQ's and such by hand, and as a result, know
exactly where everything is on the system.  Less chance of conflicts,
because you put a card in a given address, and it stays there.  With this
PCI and plug and play nonsense, you pull a card out to do some system
maintenance, put it back in a different slot, and your OS (in this case,
Windows) needs to redetect it and possibly get the drivers reinstalled.
