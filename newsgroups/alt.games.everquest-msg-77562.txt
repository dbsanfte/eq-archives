Gameplay is key.  Graphics are important, but I think we've come so far that
we tend to forget about the glorys of gameplay and think that by splashing
in a flashy cut scene here and there it makes everything alright (Spiderman
2 *cough cough*) I enjoyed the first spiderman, but for 2 they just
repackeged it with changed sprites and cutscenes, and it wasn't that great.
The innovation of a good superhero game was gone.  I think that Dragon
Warrior was, and will remain, one of the greatest RPG's, notably because it
was the first (same reason lord of the rings will always be a great fantasy
book... oh and also because it was good, but still).  I mean, sometimes you
just don't want great graphics.  I can't imagine a nicely 3d rendered slime
drawing near, with crystal clear audio. Wouldn't be the same.  But that's
nostalgia and doesn't count.  I loved played Chrono Cross due to the
graphics, which was the samem with Chrono Trigger, so I guess Graphics are
important too, but a sold game, with a great story, can be good even if
graphics aren't up to par.  A great graphic game, with a crappy story and
shallow game play is still crap.
