The person resonsible for GNKSA 2.0 identifies himself as "Jeroen
Scheerder". He provides neither academic nor professional credentials, he
provides no background information, he provides nothing to show him as the
sole decision maker of what makes a net-friendly newsreader; this is
anonymity. Yet, you seem to think that he must have this authority simply
bacause he made this list. As for these other people who cite (all of whom
are from the acknowldgements):

A discussion is not collaboration, it's informal input. Thanking someone for
their input doesn't neccessarily mean you used their input.

But it helps the argument of the guy I was responding to? The followup
redirect was done because the replyee had decided to try to force me to post
to alt.kook, a non-existent newsgroup, by using using the Followup-To:
header. I was just showing him that there was nothing incredibly clever
about the tactic and that OE can do it quite easily; it even warns me that
that anna.ng is not a valid newsgroup.
