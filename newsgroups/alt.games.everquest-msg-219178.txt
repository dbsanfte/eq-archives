Yeah... I figured fear kiting would be a highly viable strategy, but 
that's extremely limiting in terms of where one can hunt; I'd like 
dungeons to be viable not just wide empty outdoor zones, plus I can only 
fear kite for so long before becoming bored to tears...

No way I could handle that being the only viable tactic; be nice if it 
could be an option because rogues are so good at taking down feared 
mobs... but not the only trick in the book
