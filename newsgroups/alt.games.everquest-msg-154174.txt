Then...  Maybe Monks shouldn't be the default puller.

Verant has said that the FD ability wasn't intended to be
used to split pulls, it was intended to allow the Monk to
survive an otherwise fatal fight.  FD-pulling was a tactic
that players developed on their own.

It's a really handy one, granted, but it looks to me as
if Verant was unhappy with the unintended promotion of Monks
to "Best Puller Period", and they're probably not at all unhappy
that a lowered defensive ability will somewhat handicap Monks
as pullers, in order to offset their almost godlike FD
advantage during pulls.

At the very least, tactics may have to be adjusted so that
the Monk separates the mobs, but then another class (plate
class, probably) tags the mob and "runs it back to camp".
