Hmm I had not thought of that either.. yeah thats really the only
logical way to do it so they can come back if they ever do upgrade.
Wow. That makes total sense.

Of course something you are missing is the time and money it costs
them to:

1) find the account and delete the chars. Deleting the chars is such a
process that they've never done it even on chars YOU'VE deleted. Its
just too much of a bother evidently (even very old ones are still on
the backup server and if they ever go to back up you will have them
ALL back again)

2) having accounting or whomever find all the info on what the player
is owed then have a check printed out and sent to them. 

Thats a fairly large process. There way of doing it ensures that only
a person VERY serious is going to bother putting them through the
process. Anyone who EVER thinks they may upgrade to at least 98
(really not that much of a bother.. or that expensive now (I could
find an oem cd of 98 dirt cheap allowing me to upgrade in about 30
minutes probably for buying some 3 dollar piece of computer hardware
like a fan, and I live in nebraska)

So I think their reason for doing it this way is two fold:

1) only a person VERY SERIOUS about never coming back to the game or
upgrading to win 95 is going to do this while their characters are
deleted. ANYONE else would just cancel the account and then reopen the
account once they had a higher OS than 95 or a better computer. That
is the same basic option we've all had forever. Depending on the store
they bought it from and moreover (something we gamers are always too
wimpy to check I guess) the warranty/return laws of their state they
may be able to return luclin anyway if they are unable to use it. 

2) Any other person who is not so serious they can keep as a
prospective return customer by just making it more tastey for them to
cancel their account until they upgrade. Verant of course prefers to
have a customer return to their characters waiting for them (the
characters being an incentive) but they don't if you cost them 80
dollars.
