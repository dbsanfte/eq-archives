Wouldn't be the first time.

Ok then...
Tanking:  amazingly enough Rangers don't tank as well as knights.
Damage:   knights do not get dual wield, which is why their 1-handers
have superior ratios.  The MoSS is an abberation, available only thru
the bazaar, so if you want to talk about the MoSS you have to let the
Ranger gear up in the bazaar as well.  A group of mid-20s can collect
as many BABS as they like in Runnyeye, so the Deepwater Harpoon is
pointless as well (not to mention that you can buy one for a pitifully
small sum in the bazaar).
Specials:  Tracking is 10x > LH and HT.  It's not my fault if you are
fascinated by parlor tricks.  And Snare is more valuable than Tracking.

Wrong.  The reason that Rangers are worse at tanking than knights is
because that's the way the game is designed.  It is intended for it
to work that way.

Wrong again.  Fear-kiting is one possible tactical use of two of the
Rangers spells.  Snare is useful for far more than fear-kiting.  You
are complaining that Rangers have an easy solo-xp option that doesn't
give good loot, cry me a river.

/boggle
Ranger is possibly the easiest melee to play through those levels,
much easier than a Warrior or Paladin.  Snare and Camo alone make
it trivial to travel and gain experience even without a group.
Add Harmony and an almost half-adequate heal at 22 and they're
golden.
