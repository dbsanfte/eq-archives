A single uberguild group of 59+.

Newer folks, don't try it with one group. :p

My guild is one frag away from doing Rage for the very first time.  I have
50 active members and an average level of about 52 (recruitment level limit
is 20...it just works out that all our lowbies are growing up).

We are "real" dragon newbies, and we recognize Ragefire as probably the
easiest without a level restriction (if there's an easier, which one is
it?), but we're a talented bunch.  If I remember, I'll post how it
goes...hopefully we'll be click-sticked by Thursday.
