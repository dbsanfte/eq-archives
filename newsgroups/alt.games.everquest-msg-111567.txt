Then you have infinite patience with some of these morons and are to be
commended for that in itself, although you are also compounding the problem
by allowing these people to think that say "sow pls" or even just "sow" is a
good enough request to receive the buff.
Dan accused me, in an earlier thread, of power levelling an SK, I didn't (2
heals, wolf form and a chloro do not count as power levelling in my book)
but we both know that had I stayed there the SK would have kept returning,
expecting buffs and heals, which I believe is what Dan was getting at.

I have given up farm spots for appropriate level groups and left giving them
SLtW, Clarity, SoWs, Chloro and SLN just because they asked to share the
spot I was holding. Helping people I have no problem with but too many think
it's my duty to do so or take it for granted when it's done once.

Yes I hate the abbreviation, plz or pls but if it's added to a sentance like
"can I trouble you for a sow, plz" or even "could I get a sow, plz" I have
no problem ignoring it and responding in kind.
Strange that it IS on the please abbreviations that bother me and someone
using "ty" for Thankyou doesn't seem cheap at all.
