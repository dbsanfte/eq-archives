Well, alt-up/down might do the trick I wanted... I've looked through that 
before, and tried some stuff, musta just missed that one. :) left and 
right would just make my char spin around, so I'm guessing you mean 
alt-left and right?  Pgup/pgdn only pans up and down in first person view, 
alas, I've tried that one.  Thanks for the 'alt' hint though, I've been 
wondering about that for a long time.

Still, it was pretty sweet being able to get exactly the view I wanted 
just by hitting 'i'. :)
