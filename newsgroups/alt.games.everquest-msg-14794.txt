OK what U are running into is the following. Runnyeye has been taken over by
the another Pickclaw goblins. Anyway The New Goblins took over cause they
thought that Runnyeye way under the influence of the evil eyes. SO if U kill
any of the new goblins in RE U get a positive faction hit with the Evil eyes
in King Xorbb's & obviously if U kill anything in the maze U get a positive
in RE. Hope this explains things abit for U
