The Ti4200 is a 100% DX 9 compatible graphics card.  That being said,
it does NOT support 100% of DX 9's feature set (if that makes any
sense).  It'll work just fine, but realize you may not be able to see
all the "bells and whistles" available to a "Full" DX 9 card.  That
said, your frame rate should be just fine.

And no, I'm not in beta, so my above statement is not a break of the
NDA.
