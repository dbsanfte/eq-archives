When I was much younger, hunting big blue giants in Everfrost
with some partners, (As a cleric) I remember sitting on my
butt (apparantly normal posture for most clerics, but I"d managed
40 something levels of not having this happen) when I was
warned to come over quick if I wanted experience.  Mob
died before I got close enough, it seems, no exp for me, my
partners got it all, or so I thought.

Recently, though, I've found instead that if my partner
has participated in damaging the mob, but we are too far
apart when mob dies, neither of us gets exp.  Doesn't
matter if I got the kill or she did, doens't matter if I got
kill and did most of the damage or if I got kill even though
she did most of the damage...too far apart, no exp at all.

Of course there may be other factors that I'm not thinking
of, this doesn't really happen often... but I"m wondering,
how does this work, and is that a result of some change
in the past year or so?
