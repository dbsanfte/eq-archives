We have ~50 mains on our roster.  24 is enough to take Sont, but we
wiped to Aary at 5% the other day with only 32 folks.  There has to
be incentive to attend.

It's not like they kicked me out of the bloody guild.  We all still
form exp groups, I raid when I have the chance.  We have 4 scheduled
raid nights.  That means I only have to make 12 every 10 weeks to
maintain 60%.  If I can't make just over 2 raids a week then I shouldn't
have joined a guild who's express intent is to advance.
