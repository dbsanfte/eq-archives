I can't believe that even real racists could be so stupid as
to think that sort of thing is going to "spread their message",
especially since the pasted news article often does little
to support the inflammatory subject header.  I have unfortunately
run across actual hard-core racists in newsgroups, and they
don't act like hit-and-run trollers.

I lean towards the "asshole troller" theory, personally.

Here's something I wrote on another newsgroup concerning
similarly outrageous off-topic posts:

If it's any consolation, I've learned in my many
years on Usenet that most of the idiots who post
what seem to be bigoted or hate-filled posts actually
don't believe/feel what they write.

Mostly, they're jerks who get a sick kick out of
getting people outraged.  They're the internet
equivalent of the old-fashioned obscene phone caller.
You'd think that they'd all be young (and stupid) kids,
but a depressing number of them are more than old enough
to know better -- one of the most persistent such assholes
haunting the political newsgroups is in the neighborhood
of 40 years old.

These twits don't actually believe any of the crap they
spew, they just say whatever they calculate will evoke the
most provocation.  So don't take it personally.  If we
ignore these jerks, they'll go away in search of more
responses elsewhere -- they're here entirely for the
reaction they get, and if they don't get any reaction,
they'll disappear.  It's their own twisted version of
being "famous", and they're happy with it because they
understand that they'll never be able to receive attention
for any *real* accomplishment.

It seems that these emotional midgets think that they're
being somehow clever, or some sort of master psychological
manipulator like Hannibal Lector.  Instead, they're just
children with barely enough smarts to figure out the easy
task of how to push people's buttons, but not enough wisdom 
to understand why they shouldn't.

These nuts like to believe that they're not truly
despicable people, they just "play one on the net", but
as I often like to explain to these twerps, there's
really no difference at all between getting a kick out
of *acting* like an asshole, and actually BEING one.

Please do not feed the trolls.  It only encourages them
to come back for more, and more, and more.  Their appetite
for childish amusement is endless.  Stop falling for their
taunts, and they'll go away.  They're here entirely for
the outraged responses they get.  So don't give them any.
