Yeah, but its all about aggro managment.  Celes heals have virtually
no aggro. Won't even get a faction hit if heal someone fighting
something most times.  Superior heal has some aggro.

Celes heal does ~700 in 30 seconds or so.  Superior heal does 450
instantly with aggro.  Complete heal does 8K or whatever.  With celes
you have 5-6 ticks to med after you cast it.

Call me lazy, and I know the tanks hate it, but I usually just throw a
celes heal on them when they get to 80 health, and sit back down. I
don't care if they have 5000 hit points. I'd rather have them above
80% at all times so when the wiz nukes or enchanter has a mez resist,
I won't be in the middle of a complete heal, and instead can shoot a
Remedy or Celes at the caster.

Yes there are times when you use celes heal to keep a warrior between
20 and 40% health the whole fight, so they can get criplping blows and
all that. Or use it to buy some time for a complete heal when up
against some hard hitters.

I'm so glad they added a level 19 celes type heal.  Might have to
start a new cleric just to see how much easier things are. :)
