Anywhere from never doing anything together outside of chatting in /gu to 
requiring your presense 5+ nights per week all night.  It's all about what 
you're looking for.

My guild has two pages: the public page that has a very-rarely-used 
calendar app on it, lists members, gives some info about the guild; and the 
web boards where all the activity actually takes place.  Looking at the 
calendar, you'd see we had 2 raids in May and nothing planned for June when 
in fact we average 2 raids per week: 1 alone and 1 with alliance.

I'd look more at what the goals of a guild are than their activity level 
according to their web page.  When you find one that matches with what 
you're looking for from the game, make inquiries with a few of the members 
and officers regarding any specific questions you have (like activity 
level, how loot gets handled, etc).
