    update: I DID get my items back which made me very happy last night, but
it took one week and one day to happen, and in that time I had no reply to
my original email.

    Interestingly enough it was my original email they eventually replied
to, but I had already sweated for a week and a day and wasted many hours
petitioning when if they had just taken one minute to reply a few days ago I
could have stopped worrying. Just saying "yes we've noted this and will get
around to checking the logs before they expire" would've taken a load off my
mind.

    Aside from that, frankly taking a week and a day to check a log is too
much delay. If GM backlog is that severe they should jolly well hire more
GM's, and/or look into improved/easier log querying. Particularly for
something as common as item loss. (one of the five or so options in the pull
down menu on the gm contact form!)

Cheers,
James

(just glad to get my nine-hours-of-farming stuff back
