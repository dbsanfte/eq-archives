Well, pick a server, and create a character. Why you asking us?

The monthly fees are about $13, buy a game card for three months. You
have a basic account there, I doubt you have any expansions. You may
find making a character that starts in Freeport (Human/Half elf) a
good start.

Expect to see a big empty world. It is empty because most people are
playing in the expansions.

Act like you would in real life. Don't beg, don't steal, be polite.
Don't think up some scam like running a Casino to make money. You want
decent people to want to be around you, ask questions. A higher level
player is always flattered, and will answer questions.

If you have no clue, look up information here, or try eqatlas.com
