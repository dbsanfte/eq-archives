Short answer.  They can't.  The CD's are one use for registration.  Now if
they are replacing the CDs and have previously registered and are using the
same account, then OK.  If the disks have been previously registered and the
buyer is not informed, that could be fraud (and the postal authorities take
a really dim view of mail fraud)
