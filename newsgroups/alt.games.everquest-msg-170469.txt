Skill increase rate depends on the particular tradeskill, and on your stats.
If you have the highest of your WIS/INT/other stat maxxed out, that will
improve your chances of getting a skillup.  Go to www.eqtraders.com for all
sorts of conversations on the subject.

As to the tradeskill trophy, I think I have heard it's around 50/50, maybe
lower.
