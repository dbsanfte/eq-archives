No no, I said until your epic... bard epic functions as all instruments.

Until getting the epic, a string instrument that can be primary weilded is a very
handy thing.

Bard epic, you won't swap it out much, since its a decent weapon that functions as
all instrument classes (and is a bonus to singing as well).

You would take it out for a better weapon (sadly as with other classes, there are
better weapons out there than the epic) and even in some cases for better
intsruments.  I use a walrus skin drum for percussion, I think even this has a better
percussion boost than the epic (not certain of this, and don't have my epic yet so I
can't test it)

Even if the Lute did function as all instrument types, you'd see the same thing
happening.  Its not a weapon at all, so if I wanted to do melee damage I'd have it
out except on song beats.  And its not a very good instrument, so I'd have to drop in
a better drum (and perhaps better brass) when using those song types.

This "drop in" bit works because songs only check what instrument is in hand at the
instant they complete casting.  So you can use a weapon for several seconds, then
swap in instrument when the song goes off, and swap the weapon back in right away,
hardly missing a swing.  The art of manipulating various weapon and instrument
configurations is called "juggling" and is less practiced than twisting (running
several songs at the same time because of their overlapping durations) but very
effective in some cases.
