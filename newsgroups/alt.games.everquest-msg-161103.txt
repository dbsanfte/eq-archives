I haven't been able to log in with EQ IM, yet.  I always get "Invalid 
Login", even though I use the same station name and password as I use in 
EQ, using the correct case of course.

Could be a firewall issue, as both places I have tried it have a firewall.  
Anyone know what ports need to be open for this thing?

Anyone else getting this error over and over although they are using the 
correct info?
