Here's one of the reason people are cringing about gateway posters
here. You post here like it's a web forum, combining quotes from
multiple posts into a single reply...

Anyway, there's the old saying "all's fair in love and war". I tend to
loathe fighting in the first place, but if I'm going to be forced to
defend myself, I'm going to do the best damn job I can.

As if me fighting someone with streetfighting experience under his
belt is going to be fair, anyway. The knife will probably be what's
making it fair.
