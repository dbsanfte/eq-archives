Actually, a "baron" at 65 is generally someone who speedily leveled up, or
leveled up recently, since anyone who was 60 pre POP would normally have gone on
to "venerable" and so forth, "baron" is only 6 AA.  Post POP, though, a high
level "Baron" might have dozens of points into AA, since there are POP era AA
skills that don't contribute to any title at all.
