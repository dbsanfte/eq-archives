No weapon-producing quests exist at that level (well, there is the seax
quest, but that thing SUUUUUUUCKS). Your best bet would be to gather
together 5-20 platinum, and purchase a nice fine steel weapon (on the low
end) or a langseax (on the high end). If you have a couple of friends, and
the patience to get to level 15 or so, you can do the langseax quest with
them, and get it for free (and a shitload of xp)...a fun quest with a good
reward that remains an effective weapon through your mid-late twenties.

Another good option would be a velium weapon (one of the basic ones, not a
prefixed one like heavy, etched, priceless, primal, folded, etc)...magic so
you can hit wisps and ghouls with it, the proc is fluff, and the stats are
the same as fine steel, but they do look cool. 1-3 platinum over the cost
of the same FS weapon...people often like to go to newbie areas and sell
these things for a hundred platinum. Please don't be that dumb ;)
