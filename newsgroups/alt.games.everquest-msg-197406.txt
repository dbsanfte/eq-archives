How?  How do you minimize the effect of a gateway that discriminates
against certain classes and certain playstyles.  How do you minimize
the effect of a gateway that obsoletes most of the pre-existing game
content for those who pass it?  The trials could hardly have put more
stress on family-style guilds that include part-time high-end players
had it been specificly designed with that in mind!

Not relevant to what I was saying.  I was objecting to your "if your
guild doesn't drag you through the trials then it is a bad guild"
refrain.

And who the hell are you to decide "if a guild is what it should be"?
Your argument is specious.  The testimonials you deride may not be
the best of evidence, but they're worth one whole hell of a lot more
than your biased speculation built atop hearsay and supposition.

Good grief!  Have you read your own posts?  Your baseless smart-alecky
guild bashing is every bit as condescending as the most pompous of the
replies disagreeing with you.

The reason the trials have had a different impact than past keying
methods is that (1) they require a single very strong group to
complete a single task rather than a series of raids and/or extensive
farming (or just being downright easy like Old Sebilis), and (2) they
open up zones to groups and soloers that quickly obsolete most of the
old content for those players.  It's the combination of the arbitrary
difficulty of passing the trials for certain characters with the
reward for completing that passage that has driven the knife into the
hearts of some formerly good guilds.
