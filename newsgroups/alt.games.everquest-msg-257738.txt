ooh, this is fun, I haven't been able to really get into a.g.e debates too
much lately, being so EQ2 focused and generally out of the loop of what
goes on here. ^_^

I'm going to risk my reputation and give this a hard "no".  I don't have a
reference in front of me, but I'm 95% sure I've read them say you can't do
this.  This would also apply to raids, though, so...even if I'm right, I
can see this being one of those things that could change during beta,
either way.

> Can people disband during an engagement?

I don't know...I'd need to do a search on the boards and/or ask folks if
they know.  I have a feeling this is a likely way around the rules,
though...unless they've placed limitations on the ability of
vastly-differing levels to group.

If you caught my other post about this, I suspect not, since SOE might
control it so that mobs fully regen when re-locked.    I have a feeling
Moorgard has even commented on ths, but I'd have to do some hefty sifting
through old conversations.

Well, you can't CH since that spell doesn't exist, but I get the spirit of
what you say. ^_^  However, both HP and power supposedly regen so fast
between battles that the benefit might be almost pointless. By the time
you find a new opponent, you are already spiffed up.

That...might not work.  YOu cannot split mobs in this game. Encounters are
very rarely single mobs anymore, but full-blown mini "events".  If you get
bob, you get bobs brother, cousins, and scary mother.  If you try to
kidnap bob, well, they somehow know where you live. :P Mind you, the uber
guy could possibly clear entire encounters that are in the way, but I
don't see as that helps much...because that assumes that there is an
easier encounter out there for you. And there is, in the solo area...BUT
in the solo area, they are ALL single-mob encounters. So...yeah, not sure
there's much they could do there that makes a difference.  They could pull
for you if you fought by a zoneline where they could disappear, though.

...probably.  Unless the "locked" state of the encounter is something that
is readily announced, like con-level.  THat way you could only grief dumb
people. ^_^
