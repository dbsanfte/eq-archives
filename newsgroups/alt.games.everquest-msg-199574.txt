I spent a lot of time solo in LGuk from 50 to 55 with Kaev, and the
contrast with his earlier time in Unrest was enormous.  I had a couple
of fairly quick fades, but none of this immediate "You feel yourself
starting to appear" with a blinking icon the moment the spell finishes
casting crap.  The contrast with the 20 Druid going from 40 to 105
skill was not as pronounced, but it was still noticeable.  The problem
is that there is no way to prove or disprove the accuracy of my
observation short of spending way too much time sitting around waiting
for invis to fade, and with a 20 minute or so duration plus auto-break
when you cast or attack, it's just not an easily testable thing.
