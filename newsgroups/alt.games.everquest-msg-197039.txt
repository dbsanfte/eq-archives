Yeah, I take your point. I remember the excitement on catching the boats in
particular.
Sounds a sort of odd statement when I read it back hehe. But my question is
still valid I think -
have we lost our way ?

I understand this is simply your view, but is that reflected amongst others
? Am I alone
in thinking EQ is simply a level treadmill ? Where's the social interaction.
And by that
I mean...when was the last time people logged on just to sit in PoTraq to
fish and chat with
friends. I don't mean you doing it once a month, I mean regularly logged on
with the intent
on catching up, not to gain exp. No flaggging, no looting, no exp. Just
reaching out to your
friends with the sole intent on enjoying another's company online.

I created a Necro a short time back. The serverwide Necro channel astounded
me.
Somebody had roleplayed, and mistelled into that channel. What followed was
insult
after insult. The poor soul who commited the mistell was called a
'Cocksucker' and
a 'Homo' amongst other things. Is this EQ ? It was argued that this was the
Necro
channel, and what did he or she expect ? A pat on the back ?

Ok, I've digressed a little, but you catch my drift. Perhaps this link might
be of use -

Is it upon reaching a certain level that boredom might set in ? On my
server, a group of
lvl 63+ had /shouted "Free weapons and equip to anyone that hails me in the
arena"
whislt in the bazaar. Naturally, the lower levels fell for it, and sure
enough were killed.
When the tried to retrieve thier corpses, they were killed again. The Guild
involved
had a good laugh.

I have to admit, this is turning into what sounds like an Uber hating rant.
I assure you
that is not my intension. What I am getting at is this - it seems to me the
milk of human
kindness is disappearing from EQ quicker than Fippy Darkpaw. Someone tell me
this is not the case.

I've got a Lvl 55 Beastlord, Lvl54 Druid, Lvl 39 Necro on an overpopulated
blue server. All my friends are there, and I've just recently created a
Shammy
on F.V. I miss my friends alot, but don't miss the bickering, ks'ing,
badmouthing,
'cockblocking' that goes on there. We can't seem to all get along. Why ?

My margins are messed up, and it seems Outlook like it that way, so sorry if
my
post's seem out of skew, and sorry if I bored ya )
