  This is one reason I didn't really root/DoT until I could meditate without
the spellbook.  Sitting down in the middle of a fight without being able to
tell anything about your surroundings isn't exactly an ideal situation.

  I pretty much kited with my druid whenever I wanted to solo, up until
level 39 or so, and that's when I started to lean towards root/DoTing.  As
you advance, it takes more and more time meditate to full and you're less
likely to be able to kill a good experience-giving mob without meditating
during some point.  I soloed a good portion of 34-39 in the Overthere,
kiting, and on a lot of mobs I needed 2 or 3 nukes more than what I could
produce with a single "full tank" of mana to finish them off.  So at that
point I started to figure, if I'm going to have to meditate during the
fight, I might as well do it root/DoTing. :)
