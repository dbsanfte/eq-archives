Hi all,

I'm doing the Crest of the Woodnymph quest. I have foraged everything except
the Ripened Heartfruit in GFay. I foraged one long ago for my Druid epic -
took about 2 hours. I've been there for 10 hours collectively now with no
luck!

Can someone confirm - for my sanity, that Ripened Heartfruit is still on the
Forage table and that I don't have to be in any special part of the zone to
get it?

Yeah Celaeno, I know, you foraged fifty of these in half an hour, but could
only hold one as they are Lore no-drop : P BTW - I have over a stack of
Morning Dews for you, Hehe!
