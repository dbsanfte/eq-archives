As a necromancer, I found these weapons extremely useful to give to my
pets once they were big enough to proc the weapons and, even after I
retired my necromancer at level 55, I kept 2 bags full of 1h velium
weapons in the bank. While giving a pet a weapon no longer effects
damage/delay, it does still effect procs.
