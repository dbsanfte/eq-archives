I'm just saying it's possible, however unlikely, that's all.  I included
it for completeness, not to suggest it's probable.  At the least, it's
worth mentioning in case somebody else can pick up the ball and run with
the idea better than I can.

I do, however, believe some things are fundamentally unknowable; for
example, the nature of the universe before the Big Bang (if there is
such a thing as "before the Big Bang") is probably unknowable for us.
Likewise, the underlying nature of the universe may be unknowable.

But again, I would like to point out, this doesn't mean we shouldn't
constantly strive to understand the world around us.  So I don't agree
with your comment "...then we might as well not bother".  We should,
however, pick and choose what to research based on probabilities.

I think everyone would agree the probability that the universe is made
of cream cheese is very low, so the importance of researching this
possibility is pretty far down on the list.

It sounds like you're describing Chaos Theory.

You can't perfectly model the entire universe when you're stuck inside
it.  You can model parts of the universe, but even that model will be
imperfect, because something outside of the part you're modeling might
affect something inside of the part you're modeling.

Why do you hope not?

I don't see how belief in true randomness in the universe is any more or
less logical than belief in free will which is also a kind of magic.
