Three possibilities leap to mind:

1. You were in walk mode rather than run. Don't laugh. I've done it at
level 58. It happens. That run button is just too close to some others
that I click on sometimes, and when things are hectic, accidents can
happen.

2. You may have hit "d" without being in typing mode and ducked. This
slows you down a lot. Again, accidents happen. Just something to check.

3.  You may have been looking at a lag issue. Do you normally have any
lag problems in that zone? Do you notice any sort of "stuttering" in
your video, or have your partners ever commented that you seem to be
"switching" backwards and forwards a little if they autofollow you?
Until my wife got her new machine, she would lag badly in many zones,
particularly graphic intense ones like Jagged Pine Forrest. While we
both had Run Speed 3 and checked repeatedly to ensure that neither of us
were encumbered, not ducked or walking, etc. I would consistently outrun
her by a huge margin. When we got her a new super duper spiffy fast
machine, that problem evaporated entirely.  If this turns out to be it,
you may want to adjust your clipping plane way down, shut of names,
serverside filtering, etc. and other raid type lag control tricks so
that your speed improves.
