Okay til 57 that beats my leveling all hollow. I went through those
levels pretty fast but nothing like that.

>FYI at raptors in level 56 i was getting 1 blue for every 4 quads. 

I quadded raptors briefly. I stopped after I went linkdead during a
quad. One linkdeath can wipe out many hours of quadding, since it's
almost impossible to get a rez in TD.

The xp was nowhere near as good as the othmir, but I was only pulling
from the small island. My quad consisted of 3 raptors (2 static plus
roamer) and the vicious raptor.
