Just using Allakhazam's and grabbing what would be best (beats doing any
work) I come up with this profile;

http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=237866

But, my character is 52nd level, will likely never make it to 55th (in no
rush) and the only immediate improvement I am after is a Champion's Helm
(also looking at getting Guardian armour for some weaker locations) so this
isn't in any way a game plan of what items I am after as I won't ever be in
a position to get them :ï¿½)
