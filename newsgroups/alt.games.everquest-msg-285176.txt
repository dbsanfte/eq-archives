Theres a catch. you need a credit card. They don't tell you this until
after they get your personal information though. Sounds familiar...

Oh yeah Soe did the same thing. Wow Soe actually did something
original unlike the current con system and the character selcet screen
(Wow-like I'm told).

So you can tell the GM next time you speak to them.. lol... that they
better fix your problem right or you going to get the Wow Trial
account.
