Unless you use summoned arrows.  I started off with a Mage and he's lv. 52
now.  Now, I made a Ranger and whenever I plan on playing him for long
periods of time I just park my mage in his zone and fill him to the top with
arrows.  Quiver of Marr + multiple normally-summoned arrows = Kiting reds
all day long with no difficulty.  Skill maxes out too.  Lastly, the Ranger's
Tolan armor (dropped in Sebilis) has a piece that reportedly summons arrows
for you.

Summoning's the way to go, my friend.  Check it out.
