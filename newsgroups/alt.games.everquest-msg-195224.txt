Every parse I've ever seen, including my own, has shown this belief
(that higher STR hits more often) to be incorrect.  The only observed
effect of increased STR in melee is a relatively small increase in
max damage.  The effect this has on average damage will vary with the
AC of your opponent and your level and weapon and offense skill
levels.  A large increase in STR will have a noticeable effect on DPS
vs. most opponents, but a boost of 10 or 15 (i.e. a low level buff)
has very little effect.
