Evidence please.  You say it is not visible except from a plane.  Can't you
see how that supports my supposition?  So your evidence that it is a moon is
what?  You have the word of sony.  Of course they wrote the storyline, and
they can also change the storyline.  What IN GAME evidence is there?  If we
are to go by what you can actually see hear or touch in the world of
Norrath/Luclin there does seem to be little evidence supporting the claim
that it is a moon.  About the best in game arguement I have heard is the
statement that the moon you see really is Luclin.  But a real moon circling
Norrath daily would have to see the sun daily.  Geometrically it could not
be otherwise.
