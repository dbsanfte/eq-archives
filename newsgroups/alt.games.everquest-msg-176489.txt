Easiest soloing class *I've* had so far. Don't have any chars over 35 tho.

Don't know. I've mostly soloed. But they dish out so much DPS, it's tough
to claim they'd be useless in a group. Tank would be a good start though.

Oh yeah! And gator warders are da bomb! :)

Eh. Trolls and ogres get high str+sta, low wis. Iksar get high wis, low
str+sta. Kitties and barbs get an even mix. Your stat mix is likely to set
the tone for whether you mostly tank next to your pet or play pet cleric.
Both strategies are viable in the long run, and you'll most likely do some
of each.


>5. I know they recently changed how pets are summoned buffed (and cant

Each spell circle you get a spell that summons your warder, and another
spell that gives it a combat proc, a third that heals him. Plus other
stuff. Otherwise, just like other pet classes.

TROLLZ ROOL! Of course, they all do. Pick whatever floats your boat.
