I have 2 systems running the beta at the house, 1 which I consider my "good"
system running a P4 3.4 oc'd to 3.75 2GB DDR 400MZ Ram in a dual controller
config and a Geforce 6800Gt Oc'd as well.  The second or "backup" system is
an athlon 3000+ with 1 GB of 333MHz RAM and an ATI Radeon 9800XT.

Both systems run the game relatively stable, there are random crashes on
both systems that I believe are Game/Beta related, and not hardware.  At
least I hope that is the case.

With my primary setup I can run it on High Quality with a good framerate.
Anything higher causes severe slowdown, and this is noted when you select
Very High or Extreme settings in the game.  It lets you know that your
little pos probably won't run the game at these levels.

With the secondary system, I can run it on High Quality, but there are times
when the framerate drops below an acceptable level, so Balanced is a better
choice for systems around this level.

If anyone gets one in the near future, say in December for Christmas, I
would be interested to hear how the game runs with a dual card config such
as the Alienware SLI setup.  I won't be getting one any time soon, so I want
to live vicariously!

If anyone builds a system like this once the mobos are finally on the market
I would love to hear about it as well.

As far as lower level nVidia cards, I don't have a lot of input, the only
other person I know in the beta has a 6800 as well, so not sure if there are
issues with earlier cards.

I also can't compare the 6800 to the new X800's from ATI as I don't know
anyone who has one.  Maybe someone here can comment more on the performance
of those cards.
