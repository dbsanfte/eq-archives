*** We've now upgraded to DirectX 9.0c! ***

- Continuing our efforts to keep pace with current technology, EverQuest 
will be upgrading to DirectX9.0c to allow us to take advantage of many 
of the new features and fixes since our last upgrade in the middle of 
2003. You will need to be sure that you are currently running 
DirectX9.0C . If not you will need to download it. This can be done by 
simply going to http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=56513

Make sure you:

1. Get the April 2006 DirectX 9.0C redistributable version (Caution: 
Download is about 52 MB) at: 
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=fb73d860-5af1-45e5-bac0-9bc7a5254203

2. Run directx_apr2006_redist.exe. Extract the files to an easily 
identifiable directory.

3. Go to the directory the files were extracted to in step 2. Run 
"DXSETUP.EXE" from that directory.

4. Accept the license agreement. Allow the installer to update the 
DirectX components.

- Nektulos Forest got a face lift! Check out the amazing new look.

- The Guild Lobby is now available to everyone.

- The 8th-year veteran reward Throne of Heroes, a gate ability that 
transports veterans to the throne room in the guild lobby, is now 
available to those who are eligible.

- The map window now has an option to display your group mates.

- To help smooth the transition to incurring death penalties for new 
players (losing experience and leaving a corpse), the level when you 
start to incur death penalties has been lowered from level 11 to level 6 
and the amount of experience you lose when you die now starts at a very 
small amount at level 6 and slowly ramps up from there. We've added a 
corpse summoner to the tutorial who will summon corpses for free for 
anyone who is level 10 or under.

- New Hot Zones! With this patch the old hot zones have been reverted to 
their previous values and a new set of hot zones has been selected! The 
following zones are now the "Hot Zones"!

Level 20: Swamp of No Hope
Level 25: Overthere
Level 30: Timorous Deep
Level 35: Emerald Jungle
Level 40: Dreadlands
Level 45: City of Mist
Level 50: Skyfire
Level 55: Karnor's Castle
Level 60: Veksar

death.

- Buffs that increase run speed will no longer overwrite AA run speed 
increases that are better than the buff.
- You can now specify beneficial spells to block by name using the

a buff icon without editing a file.
- Attempting to gate or teleport to a zone that isn't currently running 
will no longer result in your spell bar being locked up.

Nature, and Mind Shatter.

their owners from time to time.

looking like he's falling until you stand up again.


*** AAS ***

transports veterans to throne room in the guild lobby.
- Pious Supplication has been renamed to Improved Hand of Piety.


*** Items ***

- Increased the amount of experience that evolving items gain when you 
kill an NPC. In addition, you will now gain more experience toward your 
evolving item when you are in a group, similar to how normal experience 
works.
- Reduced the amount of experience required to level up intelligent 
items. If your items now have more experience than is required to level, 
they will evolve the next time they gain experience.
- Due to the changes to how fast you gain item XP, the amount of XP 
required to evolve the Cloak of the Spirit Tracker has been increased.
- Evolving an item should no longer cause occasional crashes.
- The aura effects from Prophecy of Ro "clicky" items are no longer 
restricted to only hitting your group. In addition, they will no longer 
recast their effect every 6 seconds, but instead will remain on a 
character for as long as they are within range of the aura.
- Throwing axes should now pull from ammo/inventory appropriately.
- Lowered the duration on the spin stun on Peace of the Disciple Strike 
and One Hundred Blows while in PvP.
- Bane of Muram and Curse of Muram now last 18 and 36 seconds respectively.
-Modified the Battleworn Symbol of Rage. The charm was calculating 
values higher than intended and now should be on par with other 
Demiplane of Blood level charms.
- Changed all four of the Furious Bash Augments from DoD that use 
Ambleshift's Amazing Automated Amalgamator to Improved Block. 
Additionally the names of the Chronal, Discordant and Bazu seals have 
been changed appropriately.
- Altered the Favorable Breezes line of augments from DoD that use 
Ambleshift's Amazing Automated Amalgamator. They now give a different 
progression of effect.
- Increased the level required to equip the following augments to 45 to 
match the level that their effect is able to be used: Carnivorous Coral, 
Deepwood Hunter's Stone.
- Increased the level required to equip the following augments to 60 to 
match the level that their effect is able to be used: Green Fire 
Phosphorous, Frozen Malachite, Jagged Dragon Scale, Turquoise Lifetap Sieve.

match the level that their effect is able to be used: Volcanic Sink

Stone, Faerie Luck Stone.
- The Mystical Aptitude effect will now last its full 20 minutes.
- Vibrating Gauntlets of Infuse and Vibrating Hammer of Infuse are now 
lore to each other. This is to prevent players from getting into an odd 
state that could cause a crash.
- Barbarians can now use Naturalist's Leather Arm Wraps.
- Roleplayer's Jester now looks like a doll rather than a bag.
- The Burning Affliction focus effect on The Skull of Torture should now 
work properly.

instead of one-handed blunt.
- The Cracked Stone of Savagery now has the proc effect of Lifesap I.
- The Shard of Crystallized Rage now has the proc effect of Fiery Strike II.


*** Skills ***

- Made changes to the taunt formula at high levels. A level 60 character 
taunting an even con or higher level NPC will now use the character's 
taunt skill to determine success rate, similar to what occurs below 
level 60. The chance to taunt is roughly the same. In addition, the 
reduction in your chance to taunt creatures higher level than yourself 
now occurs at a slower rate and the minimum chance to taunt an NPC is 
higher. Also, you will now gain a bonus to your chance to taunt NPCs 
that are lower level than yourself. To go along with the change to use a 
character's taunt skill after level 60, paladins and shadowknights have 
had their taunt caps increased to match warriors and ranger's skill cap 
has been increased to 200.
- Taunts that fail because of distance will no longer cause you to have 
to wait the cool down period before attempting to taunt again.
- Ranged combat should behave much more consistently now.
- Increased the sense and disarm range on many traps throughout the world.
- /con will now properly report whether an NPC can see you sneaky rogues.


*** Tradeskills ***

- Increased the amount of mobs that can drop exceptional shissar blood.
- The tradeskill recipes for Dreary Deeds and Infusion of Spirit have 
finally been discovered.
- Merchants across the world realized that they were selling small 
pieces of ore at a loss. They have mutually agreed on a price increase.
- The poisons from the Omens of War era will no longer magically create 
a vial; they now require two of the appropriate poison vial.
- You will no longer be able to combine ingredients that you have up for 
sale in the bazaar.
- The Antonican forge has moved to outside of Armor by Ikthar.
- Failing to create Frost Bunny Stew will now return your pot to you.

to No Drop.

vials. There are two shark skin items, both with the same name.

effect.
- Bitter feedback poisons will not properly bestow the Bitter Feedback 
proc effect.


*** Quests ***

- Removed the "Loot 4" requirement from all of the "Bring Me Their 
Heads" quests in Devastation and Stronghold of Rage. This should make 
these quests more accessible by allowing characters to collect the items 
needed, then get the quest and hand them in to complete it.
- Added an experience reward for the "Bring Me Their Heads" and "Engines 
of Destruction" tasks in the Devastation and Stronghold of Rage.
- Fixed a problem with the Shaman epic 2.0 Elder Spirit of Enlightenment 
in West Freeport. Seemed he wanted to enlighten himself by wandering 
where he shouldn't. He should now happily lead shamans from the Jade 
Tiger Inn into the courtyard for the ritual.
- The drop rate of the Twilight Sea armor quest gems has been increased 
significantly. In an effort to keep the amount of money entering the 
world from those gems roughly the same, the value of the gems has been 
reduced as a result.
- Shalowen the Pure will now return The Chalice of Life if you have 
completed the single group missions in his arc in order and turning in 
the chalice of life drop from the Corruption of Ro raid.
- Exploring the Valley of Xanzerok for the Arcstone quests should now 
work correctly when levitating.


*** Events ***

- The LDoN raids have been switched over to use the expedition system. 
This means you can add new players to the raid at any time, and the 
lockout occurs at the end after a success instead of at the beginning 
when the raid is launched. Also, the maximum player limit has been 
increased from 36 to 54, and all death count failure mechanics have been 
removed.
- The events in Deathknell, Tower of Dissonance now have individual 
lockout timers instead of applying a lockout to the entire zone.

from his room.

the Performer event.

a bit less easy to split.

- Increased the distance that the Dwarf armies must be from basecamp in 
The Defense of Thurgadin monster mission before they return to full 
combat potential. Units moving to forward locations are guaranteed to be 
back in combat states when they reach their destinations but may still 
be thinking of resting while they are in transit.
- Dain`s Historian Duggans will now review with you which of his 
missions you have completed and turned in a seal for that mission. 
Simply ask him to "Review" the Coldain History you have studied.
- Corrected an issue that could cause you to not get credit for 
finishing the mission "Train" if you were charmed when it completed.
- Corrected an issue that could cause the mission "Creepy Concerto" to 
not update properly if there were pets or auras in the mission.

- The Guild Lobby is now available to everyone, whether they own Dragons 
of Norrath or not.

- Added an Augment Sealer Pool to Arcstone.

in Anguish and Muramite Proving Grounds.

version of Freeport.

Dawnshroud Peaks.

weaker than before.
- The portal to Dranik's Scar from East Freeport has a visual effect again.
- The entrances to Paineel and The Hole can be lock picked once again.
- The Hunter/Forager cycle in Trakanon's Teeth should no longer spawn 
multiple copies of the same creatures.
- Corrected an issue that could cause several non-targetable creatures 
to attack you in Halls of Honor.
- Casting Succor in Grimling Forest will no longer put you under the world.
- Fixed a problem with the Guild Hall Portal that could cause the 
teleport confirmation window to display the incorrect target zone.
- Fixed an issue in Illsalin that was causing groups of arena combatants 
not to despawn after the event.
- You should no longer get stuck behind the grate leading into Dranik 
Sewers.
- Kerra Ridge should now be much friendlier to lower level adventurers.


*** NPCs ***

- Updated the character models for many NPCs throughout the world. This 
includes changing Illusion: Werewolf to use the new werewolf model.
- The corpse summoners in the guild lobby are no longer fooled by 
shrouding down to lower levels before handing in a soul stone.
- Creatures without legs have lost the ability to kick.
- The treants in Theater of Blood that have been shedding hooves and 
horse meat will no longer do so.
- Lowered the hit points and increased the respawn time of the door that 
leads from Devastation into Stronghold of Rage to make access to 
Stronghold of Rage easier.
- The angry and hurt Faydedar that Dolgin helps people bait no longer 
has any viable meat on him.
-Terrorantula's children should no longer warp across the desert.
- Summoning a horse should no longer upset nearby NPCs.


*** Maps ***

- Cartographers have been very busy. Numerous map fixes made.
- The map window now has an option to display your group mates.


*** UI ***

- The default size for the barter and bazaar windows has been increased.
- You can now filter the barter window by seller name.
- The guild window should now display information properly for guilds 
with over 999 members.


*** Miscellaneous ***

- We've now upgraded to DirectX 9.0c!
- Many pathing issues have been resolved. Monsters rejoice!
- The Universal Chat system will replace the old Channel Server for all 
channel operations. All player-owned channels will be moved over 
automatically and using channels in the new system is the same as 
before, so you should not notice any difference. One of the primary 
benefits of this change is that channels now support cross-server and 
cross-game functionality. EQIM will no longer work with this change 
however we do intend to remedy this situation if possible in the future.
- Luclin character models are now available to everyone, whether they 
own Shadows of Luclin or not.
- Increased the amount of experience you gain toward your shroud 
progression when you kill an NPC as a shroud. In addition, you will now 
gain more experience toward your evolving item when you are in a group, 
similar to how normal experience works. This does not affect the 
evolving tradeskill trophies, which don't gain experience from killing 
creatures.
- Fixed a number of rendering anomalies that could occur throughout the 
game.
- Targeting corpses should now be much easier and much less confusing.
- Item links can now be sent across Universal Chat channels!
- Ogre females using voice emotes for Agree and Disagree will now play 
the proper voices.
- Player and NPC names should now be rendering correctly at all times 
when they are overlapping.
