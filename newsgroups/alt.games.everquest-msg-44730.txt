The thing is, I've heard from people that even though it says your 
merchant faction has been raised, you get zero faction changes as a DE. 
 On the Allakhazam forums there are people who have used ShowEQ and 
noticed that it gives you  a +1 increase for the emeraldwarriors faction 
and a +0 increase for the merchant factions, even though it SAYS that 
your faction has improved with the merchants.  If so, it would seem that 
VI purposely made it so DE's can't bank there. So before I invest a ton 
of time buying shark meat and doing this quest, I was wondering if any 
dark elven followers of innoruk have ever been able to deal with 
merchants or bank.
