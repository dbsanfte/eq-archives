Up to level 10, you don;t need to do anything. You are respawned with all
your kit.

After that it gets more complex. 

Everyone has a so called 'bind point'. This is a game defined place you
respawn at when you die - or go to if you cast the right spell.

This point can be moved. Casting classes with the spell can bind
themsleves pretty much anywhere (there are exceptions). Non casters need
to have the spell cast on them by someone else, or one of the in game
'Soulbinders' who do the same job. This option is much more limited, as it
can only be done in certain places, usually city zones although there are
a few others scattered about.

When you die, you leave a corpse at the spot you die, with all your kit on
it (except for the stuff in the bank). You respawn at your bind point.
There is a limited timer that your corpse will exist for. You need to get
back to your corpse to get your kit back. A ressurection type spell
actually brings you back to the corpse.
