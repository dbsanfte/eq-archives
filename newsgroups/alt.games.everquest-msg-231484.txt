The Spiderling Silk thread got me to thinking...
I'm curious about how the bazaar differs on the various servers. On
Vazaelle, from what I see, some of the most popular items are the Spiderling
Silks (10-15pp), Handmade Backpack Tokens (25-50pp), Quality pelts (up to
100pp for HQ bear) and a few other things.

What I would like to know is what the most popular items are that are seen
in the various bazaars and how the prices vary.

Just seems like an interesting topic.
