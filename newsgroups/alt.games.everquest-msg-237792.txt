(OT)  I always find the use of this word amusing.  You have no idea
what it really entails, but you figure it looks better than "I was
ticked off".

I'm 47 years old, and I've been enraged exactly once in my life.  I've
been angry many times.  If you had been enraged ONCE with her, you'd
have broken off contact with her immediately and permanently.  If you
weren't a sociopath, of course.
