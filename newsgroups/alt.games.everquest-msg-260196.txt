Even though I do play a bard I would not argue in favor of the bard if
he decides to swarm in RM. One bard could actually lock down the whole
hill giant spawn without trouble. And this is violating the play nice
policy in my book.
Granted, rooting a mob out of the swarm is killstealing. But playing
intolerant or outright offensive should weigh more. So kick the bard. :P
I'm not to say that swarming should be banned but if you are in a zone
where a lot of people competing over the spawns you should be at least
so tolerant to leave some mobs to others.
