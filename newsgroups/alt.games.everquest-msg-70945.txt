I'm guessing it would take 110 rare occasions. 
:-)

But seriously, if one of our clerics runs out and buys a horse for 110
KPP, then I'm probably going to say "Nice horse. Grats."  It's really
none of my business where they got the money. I'm just grateful to be in
a guild with four 51+ clerics already and more being recruited. If they
get rich in our groups, and remain fat, happy, healing clerics on all of
our raids and xp outings, I'm as happy for them as can be.
