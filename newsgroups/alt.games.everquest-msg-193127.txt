i didn't define it because it's a generally known word.  i didn't feel
that it required further definition.

meaningless?  hardly.  i'm just leaving it up the the reader to
split the fine hairs if he chooses.

for example, if a level three warrior kills oodles of spiderlings,
sells the silk, and buys some uber sword with the profits, is he
a twink?  i am deliberately sidestepping this issue,  and i don't
think my description of "twinking" is any less informative for it.
