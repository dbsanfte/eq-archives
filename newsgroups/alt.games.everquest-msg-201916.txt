> What is your D&D memory?

Good times :)

I started D&D in grade-school with someone that I've known now since
we were 5 years old.  At this point, it was the red-box D&D set (3rd
printing, I think) around 1980 or so.

From there, we progressed to AD&D and picked up a friend who lasted
awhile before drifting off.  The DM and I are still good friends now
at 32, still live in the same small town, and get together to
adventure (and yes, with good friends you EASILY get sidetracked) --
although it's a hodge-podge of games now, rarely with dice. 
Definitely more a role-playing than a dice-rolling thing.

1st Edition AD&D will always be my favorite.  Best single adventure
was the argument we got into over a trap (I think we were 12 or 13 at
the time) -- a villain had set up his entire castle to collapse inward
on us.  I was livid, the PC I'd worked months on (we rarely kept to
the same characters for a year or more before rebooting the campaign)
was dead of a trap I insisted was absurd!  Who would build a castle,
stock it with monsters and treasure, and design it to collapse?

It was still great fun, though :)
