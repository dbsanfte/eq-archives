Well, these are the same people who are charging $50 to move characters
naked between servers--something that costs them almost nothing (and even
benefits them, because people tends to move from crowded to less crowded
servers, reducing the need for new servers).

EQ is into the third stage of a game's lifetime: it's got a playerbase that
will pay for pretty much anything Sony cares to put a separate price on, and
the business people at Sony are more in charge than the gamers at Sony, so
this is just the start.

See http://www.business2.com/articles/mag/0,1640,42210,00.html:

    Hidden revenue streams are just starting to be understood. Sony runs about
    42 versions to avoid overpopulation in any one world. But instead of simply
    load-balancing the number of players per computer, it allows fans to
    relocate their characters to different worlds on other servers -- for $50 a
    move. "Would you believe we've generated over $1 million in revenue simply
    from moving characters?" Smedley marvels.
