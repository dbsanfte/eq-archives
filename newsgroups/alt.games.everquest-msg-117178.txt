Can you do it? Yes.
Should you do it?  I don't bother anymore, myself. Not worth it with my
card.
How to do it? Your best bet is a utility called PowerStrip.

A few caveats: like overclocking a CPU, this is not for the faint of heart.
Go slow. If you begin to ecounter crashes or graphical glitches, clock it
back down. Your performance probably won't improve a vast amount, but it
could grab you a few extra fps.
