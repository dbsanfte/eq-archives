Thank god so many people hate that zone. :)

Trouble with that zone is, if there's more than about 4 people HUNTING in
the zone (as opposed to going to Unrest or waiting for Bilge) it's
over-camped.

You don't say what your class is and I can't remember, sorry.  I hunted in
there from about 16-21 with my druid.  Now that you can snare AND root (it
used to be that you couldn't) that zone is great, though dangerous because
everything but those 4 goblins and 3(?) orcs are roamers.  Necros and druids
would do fine soloing there.  Pretty much anyone else will want a friend
along who compliments their class.

Make sure you're SoWd, 'cause you're going to need it.  You'll learn those
twists and turns up the ramp of Butcherblock very well. <g>  This is NOT an
easy zone...it IS a challenge.  To me, that's what makes it fun.
