There are known issues with this particular MB and DDR400 memory.  It 
would not explain the problem he is having however.  I have this MB, and 
an Athlon XP 3200+, and did have issues with some Dual Channel DDR400 
memory, which, Kingston promptly replaced with memory that worked with 
this MB.  Personally, were I to do it again, I'd go with a different MB.  
I have a fellow guildie who has run into exactly the same types of issues 
I have with this particular MB as well.
