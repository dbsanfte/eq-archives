Very true, but like complete heal, disc defensive is the main reason
warriors are still stuck as in Kunark as far as keeping pace with other
classes. It's the millstone around their neck, and most would happily
see it replaced with some other mechanism that allowed the same
effectiveness on raids while bringing them in line with other classes in
experience groups. Changing their damage mitigation so they are
effective outside of their "3 minutes of glory" is one way that's been
proposed, though that removes some actual interesting tactics in high
end raiding, like seemless tank switches when the discipline runs out,
which is often used now and actually requires a bit of skill and
teamwork to pull off smoothly by the entire raid.

While allowing warriors to hold agro better would definately make a lot
of high end encounters easier, allowing any tank class to hold agro
easily has already trivialized lower level content and experience
groups. Not only do paladins have agro lock on single targets, their
group heals actually give them a more effective area effect taunt than
the relatively expensive warrior aa skill ae taunt. The group heal adds
much more than the +1 to hate of the ae taunt.
