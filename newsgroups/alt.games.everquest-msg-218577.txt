There is a difference between "being able to handle rudeness"
and "asking someone to be less rude", Mrs. Annie Benson-Lennaman.
Perhaps you've missed that subtle difference.  Please, feel free
to rip me a new one, and you'll find I'll rip you a new one right
back instead of running with my tail between my legs.

When a subject isn't particularly important in the grand scheme
of things -- like tradeskills in EQ -- being snippy (both on the
sending side and receiving side) is no big deal.

When I'm being grossly misunderstood on a subject that *is* more
important in the grand scheme of things, I prefer a more grown up
discussion.  (And I'll readily admit the misunderstanding is
probably my fault.  I'm attempting to clear that up now.)  Asking
for politeness seems entirely appropriate.

No, Mrs. Annie Benson-Lennaman, that isn't what I implied.

: That is a global, drastic and

: if you state it publicly, then you open yourself to be questioned about
: it.  Remember, you said that people like that should be shot.  That's
: pretty final and drastic for the people involved.  

I've done the best I can trying to "flesh out" what I meant.
I thought I had made it clear.  I'll try again:

If propsective parents have a severe genetic disorder (as determined
by one or more qualified professionals), and also a non-trivial chance
of passing on that severe genetic disorder to their children (as
determined by one or more qualified professionals), and they choose
to have children anyway (knowing they're taking the huge risk of
bringing a child into this world who will suffer a great deal), then
I believe those parents are acting irresponsibly.

I hope I've made myself clear, Mrs. Annie Benson-Lennaman.  If I
haven't, please feel to follow-up with any questions you may have.
But please, before you do, leave your subtle insults ("if you can't
handle the heat, get out of the kitchen") behind, thank you.

:    I don't deal well in abstracts.  So let me ask you about your
: position using myself as an example.

Hopefully I've already made myself clear.

:     My dad is obese.  So am I.  If I had a kid, there is a good chance
: that I would pass this on.  Should I get shot if I have a kid?  My
: father also has diabetes.  I do not (yet) but there is a pretty good
: chance that I carry the gene for it.  Does that earn me a bullet?

I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume your
news server sucks and you haven't seen my many other posts on this
subject.  Clearly, obesity and diabetes are not severe genetic
disorders, so neither of those situations would quality.  I don't
need to reference one or more doctors to determine something that
obvious.

: How

: about all three points taken together?  

I think I've already adequately responded to this.

:    There's a problem with broad global statements.  In order to make
: sense, they have to be applied to individuals, and since we are all
: individuals, we have an urge to respond statements like this.

If it makes you feel any better, I've inherited my own supply of
crappy genes.

I'll try to end this on a positive note.

Repeat after me: We Are All Individuals.
