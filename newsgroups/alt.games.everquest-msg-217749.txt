Assuming you have the slots to carry it all back.  Theres a real point where
it's not worth it to carry back words to vendor at 2 pp each.  It's then
either "make them into celestial essences and carry back a stack" or "let
them rot".

And save your looter's VT slots for 50 - 200 pp gems, 200 pp ruby crowns,
etc...
