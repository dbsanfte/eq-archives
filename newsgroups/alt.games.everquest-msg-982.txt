I thought to myself when I posted this reply originally "self, the female
faces have more colors and the armor will be different colors on males vs
females" and then I thought to myself "self, the *major* noticeable
difference that someone can easily see is the tail".  That is why I stated
that the "The only major difference is the tail.  It is very slender on the
female."

Thanks for adding all of the things that I didn't want to add to my original
reply though.  ; )
