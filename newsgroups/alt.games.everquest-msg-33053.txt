If the roles and responsibilities haven't been settled, then the cleric
will have to say something.  Someone in a multitank group, other than
the puller, and the Main assist, should be assigned as the caster
protecter.  He keeps an eye on health bars, when an add moves off the
main assist, or the caster bars move down he drops off the primary
target.

precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
