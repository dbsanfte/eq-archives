Particularly if you take into account the following:

You can cast Ice spear or what have you, followed by concussion, many
times if done with goot sense. This adds up to a ton of damage.

Plus, if you cast manaburn *once* on a big mob that's still mostly
alive, the wizard will not be doing any additional damage later unless
it's to the fire beetle walking by his bind point while he waits for his
rez.
