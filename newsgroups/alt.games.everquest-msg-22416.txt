Ask any high level guild about the druid pet spell; they should have
extras from their uberkills (especially vindicator).

Mask of the Hunter dropped off of Tolapumj if I remember correctly. I
forget where I got Form from. Both kinda blow goats anyways - no mana
regen on the Form and no doggy on the Mask. I mostly stuck with
Howler.
