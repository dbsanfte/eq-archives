Dear diary,
                Today was an o.k day. I was only killed by three hundred and
fifty two newbies and took out five of them mself. I also was accosted by a
couple of beggers asking "sow plz" and "Spare a few pp for a newb?" which im
sorry! but not without the proper manners thaank you very much. so i tend to
anon or roleplay now to avoid this. 


Dear diary,
                Today i embarked on a bold move. I wish to raise some faction
with the guards outside of qeynos and so i sidled up to one intending on asking
him for any quests i might undertake. He was less than pleased and ran his
blade straight through me. I responded by lurking nearby and repeatedly calling
him a poon.
