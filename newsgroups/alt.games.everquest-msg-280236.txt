Hehehe ...  You should actually be asking the more basic question: Are 
you aware you are actually reading and posting to usenet!!

I'm not remotely convinced that the majority of the E-Marr forum crowd 
even know what usenet is, The site admins have got it feeding into their 
web based forum site; I'd be impressed if even half of the userbase knew 
that there was a lot more than just another web forum going on behind 
the scenes in the "a.g.e" forum pages.
