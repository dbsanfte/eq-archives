If you're on Norrath:

Get a spire stone from the Nexus Scions at various wizzie portals.
Wait for port up. When you get to the Nexus, look around for a tunnel
that has a male guard, and a female guard in leather. Go down the
tunnel, make a left at the Kunark Scion, then follow the tunnel, and
you're there.

If you've created a Vah Shir and want to know how to get there, best
to visit www.eqatlas.com
