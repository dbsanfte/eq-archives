Rangers used to suck ass.. totally.  They did a lot of damage, but couldn't
take a blow for shit.. imagine a chanter duel wielding <-- that was a ranger
of old :)

Rangers now...  one of the best damage dealers in the game, some great group
spells, and extremely versatile.  Guildie ranger who i talk with a lot is at
5100 or so raid buffed now, and hes the newest of the old batch of ranger
recruits (the older rangers have more hp).. thats decent, to say the least

Why would it be called "warrior port"?  I mean it would apply to any melee..
a friend used to do it all the time when she needed to train a skill on her
monk (which meant a long hike back to FP) and then get back to Thurgadin

I couldn't do it now, my bank is absolutely full of nodrop stuff (velious
quest armour) old NODROP items i havent had the heart to destroy yet, quest
gems, luclin quest components, and various loot stuff ive been too lazy to
move to my bazaar mule yet

I logged into the monk one (for monkly-businness.com, the main monk website)
It was actually during a 24hour+ camp too (not killing place holders..  just
looking at the same patch of snow till she popped)

I lasted maybe 5 mins in it, and never went back.  I coun't imagine trying
to play, and be in a channel like that
