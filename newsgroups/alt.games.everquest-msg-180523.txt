Hm. And I assess, based on about four years of play experience with the 
original game and each of the expansions thus far, that they do indeed 
test enough, at least as far as I'm concerned. I haven't really ever 
come across any problems that have spoiled my enjoyment of the game. 
Then again, I don't play a Bard.

Now, what you are certainly qualified to say is that Sony do not meet *
your* standards for testing their product. That's a matter between you, 
your wallet and Sony. And of course all the people who jump up asking 
for your stuff.
