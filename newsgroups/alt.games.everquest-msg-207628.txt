...unless SOE decides to make EQ "sense" where its mouseclicks are
coming from...  But one hopes they won't get that Big Brotherish.

I too would like to use a macro utility in a non-exploitive way.
I usually play EQ on a laptop that has a touchpad instead of a mouse, 
which I really like in a lot of ways, but it's pretty sucky
for the rapid precision clicking necessary for tradeskills.

And yes, I could plug in an external mouse, but that has its
own disadvantages, including needing to lug a mouse around,
and the fact that I multitask on my laptop a lot, and when
the mouse is plugged in the touchpad is disabled, meaning that
for many tasks I lose the convenience of the touchpad.  Even
some things in EQ are easier with the touchpad -- tradeskilling
is the *only* thing that's improved by the mouse.  Sigh.

It would be so much easier if they just implemented some
sort of "mass combine" in the game itself, where you could
say, "Take an X and a Y and 2 Z's from my inventory, and
autocombine them in my Sewing Kit repeatedly until I run 
short on any of those components in my inventory".

Hmm, or maybe just a "repeat" button next to the "combine",
which says "remember that last Combine?  Do it again.",
for the same effect.
