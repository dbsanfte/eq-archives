Ergo, don't be a grunt... but, admittedly, that's an entirely different 
debate.

Fair enough. In that case, what has been horribly oversold is the 
"sacrifice" aspect of the tale.

Well, if we add to that "not that omniscient" and "not that 
omnibenevolent", we've seriously reduced the scope for disagreement. And 
if we were to agree on "not that extant", we'd have eliminated it 
entirely. :)

Well, in that case, we could just as easily, replace "the Inquisition" 
with (Godwin be damned) "the Nazis" and we'd be in exactly the same 
situation.

And, precisely for that reason, it's one that completely blows the very 
concept of "morals" right out of the water.
