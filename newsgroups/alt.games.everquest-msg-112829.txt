Are they behind a firewall?   I'd guess that, if they can't ever use it,
they've got some issues with ports being blocked either by a
firewall they run or their ISP runs.   I've heard the chat channels
use the same ports as IRC servers (I haven't verified that, however.)
If so, testing to see if they can connect to an IRC server might be
a good test.  (www.mirc.co.uk is the home page for one of the more
popular Windows IRC clients.)
