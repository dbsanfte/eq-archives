Also from Shamans, you might want to get some Damage Shield potions.
They come in two "strengths", and the ultimate amount of the damage
shield will depend on your own level.

When in a close fight, the extra damage caused by the damage shield
can make all the difference.  And especially when several things are
attacking you, the damage shield's effectiveness is multiplied by the
number of mobs -- plus that way you can knock down the health of
all your opponents even before you kill off the first one and
turn your sword to the next.

What's also nice is that Damage Shield potions last a *lot* longer than
the damage shield buffs you get from casters.

Also in Cazic Thule, from the Lizard Cenobite (in the Avatar of
Fear room) you can get the Lizard Blood Potion, which is an
*instant* cast potion (single charge) that gates you to the
wizard pyramid in Cazic Thule.  It's handy for escaping from
really nasty situations that would be certain death otherwise.


>Finally , many items have charges of healing , what would you recommend ?

I've never found any healing potion worthwhile.  Just think of your
Bandages as "healing potions", and use them instead.  They're a lot
cheaper per HP healed.

Other useful items you should never be without are the
invisibility potions and underwater breathing potions
you can buy from vendors in most cities.  They don't stack,
which is somewhat annoying, but they're the sort of thing
that when you need them, you *really* need them.
