The trainers are all located in Neriak Foreign quarter, if you look 
around on the south west side of town you will find them, they even
added a new area to neriak foriegn quarter to support them. Hell they
even brought a froggie prisoner with em. I found all this not even
looking for anyone, it was out of curiosity that led me to my
discoveries, imagine what you could find if you tried just a little
bit, or you could just wait until eqatlas posts the updated maps.

But hey who said that Trolls were the brightest lot anyway, go figure
Just goes to show Ogres are superior
