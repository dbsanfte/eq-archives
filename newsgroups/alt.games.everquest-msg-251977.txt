LOL, why do I feel like we've just run in circles here? The point is, I'm
getting SOME kind of bonus on my hits, otherwise why would I be hitting for
100+ points with a weapon that only does 30 damage? :)

My new weapon, with a damage of 15, was doing 40 damage last night and this
morning (it may have gone beyond that, haven't looked at the logs yet to
see). As I stated before, that's melee damage, not the procs on the weapon.
