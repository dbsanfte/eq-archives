Death sucks.

I'm not good at offering comfort.

I just lost one of my own college friends. She graduated 2 years after I 
did- got a doctorate at Harvard, post-doc work at Standford in genetics. 
Had finally finished all of that schooling, married one of the most 
wonderful guys on the planet, and a week after the marriage ceremony, 
got into a 12 car pile up, and is no more. Her husband, who was driving, 
survived. Poor guy.
