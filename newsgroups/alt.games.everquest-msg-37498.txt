I'll go along with this, Verant (if nothing else) are consistent, a
little experience will teach you what they will and WON'T deal with.
For example: Petition them saying "This d00d in EC scammed me of my
Wurmie" will result in no reaction. Petition them with "soandso used a
bug or exploit to caused my WS to drop on the ground, at which point
he made off with it" and you will get a totally different reaction.

Another example. "This guy trained me and I died thats not fair man I
lost lvl 25" will result in nothing. However, "4 groups in our guild
died due to a server outage, while deep in Chardok" will result in a
Guide showing up inside 30min to rez everyone.

I guess my point is... Learn what you are paying for and accept it. 

Oh... And stop whinning. You pay the money remember, if you don't like
it, don't pay.

Pretty simple really.
