Heh, well sorry to tell ya but this is the 2nd easiest part of the
quest. I dunno if you already have them but the heart of frost and
fire you need to get are kind of hard to get. To get the frost one get
in on a Vox raid. Just invis past all the goblins and into the room
with the goblin king and such, the meeting place for raids is right
there and happens to be where the goblin wizard comes as well.
Just stay there as long as you can killing all the goblins in the
place though when I was there any goblin that popped was almost dead
in an instant with so many lvl 50+'s there. It took about an hour and
a half to get mine but someone else was getting one before me so 2
wizards spawned within that time so it's not that bad. As for the
heart of fire just goto sol a with a lvl 50 tank preferably someone
who can heal himself like a paladin or ranger and he'll easily get you
past all the goblins and into the bar place. Once you go in the door
to the bar the goblin wizard spawn place is through the left door. I
you're having trouble getting a guy to come just remind him that the
bartender in the bar drops those mammoth cloaks or whatever that sell
for like 300pp maybe less now but it's a good newbie wisdom item to
have. Hope this helps in some way, oh and when I killed the skeletons
I was with a lvl 56 mage so I can't give any good advice on that other
than kill the skeletons first cus the pets are punks.
