Actually 52 is when quad kiting started to suck, bad.  Granted I never did
raptors, and probably never will.

And I still made level 57 faster root/rotting than a druid friend of mine
who's been in CS the whole time.

Only 1 more level til I can be un-suck. =o

BTW, 2213 hp / 938 ac self buffed now =D
