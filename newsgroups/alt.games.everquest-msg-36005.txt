Mostly I think. You start off at the level you put a point into it. If you
get something like tracking at 20 and put a point into, I believe you start
at 20 tracking.

I know the code is weird for research and I think there are other anomolies
like in the tracking example, if you waited until you were say 33 before you
put that one point into it, you would immediately be at 33 tracking. If VI
really wanted to take pity, they would give you the (level + 1)*5 vs 33 or
~170.
