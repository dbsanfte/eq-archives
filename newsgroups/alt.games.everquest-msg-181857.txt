What class is the most underpowered?

My votes go to:

1) Rangers
- Low tank ability at higher levels, but can perform good as offensive
addition to a group with a main tank already. But, high level groups will
more often go with some other class, rather than have a gimp tank. This
class just seems so unuseful at high levels compared to what another class
can bring.
Gimp Rating: G00d j0b j00 r lvl 12. Reroll as a WAR/SK/PAL/DRU.

2) Wizards
- Lowest DPS all offensive classes. Broken spelllines, and spelllines that
cant stack well. Useless class AA abilties. The hardest spells to attain for
all classes ingame, and even then the spells doesn't bring the class into
balance. Brings very little to groups, most caster classes can nuke if
needed. Recent expansions indirectly nerfs their power.
Gimp Rating: It doesnt get any better the higher you go. Reroll a MAG/DRU.


I am really glad my main is an SK, in comparisson, i am really dissappointed
in the WIZ class. I played both to 50+ levels, and my WIZ is so lacking in
the sustainable power my SK has. I am not a whiner, as i love my SK class,
as it rocks, but WIZ is really something that VI should look at. Everyone
who has a main WIZ should try a different class and see for themselves how
bad it is. I never played ranger, but i have grouped with them at high
levels, and that class just seems completely not needed.
