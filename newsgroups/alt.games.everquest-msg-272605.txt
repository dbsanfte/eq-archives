That's going to happen anyway. Deal with it.

As long as the pendulum keeps swinging I'd be happy. I don't care if I 
spend 3 months being thought of as 'lame' if i spend the next 3 months 
being the cats meow, followed by 3 months of being joe average... that's 
balanced too, in its way.

Or they'd imagine differences that weren't there.

What if the pit of chasms gives the best boots but chasm of pits gives 
the best gloves? Variety is preserved, and both classes are still 
different.

Besides, when you sit down to roll a new character,  are you seriously 
going to pick which one to roll based on class desireability in a 
specific zone in a specific expansion that will be empty and obsolete in 
<5 months?

You'd be wrong about many of those people.
