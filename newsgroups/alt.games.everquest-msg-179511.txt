A good ongoing game goes through three stages, I think.

First stage.  The developers have a vision, and are true
to it.  Sometimes the vision overrides fun, but when the developers do
something that pisses you off, you can at least respect it--they are hard
core gamers, just like you are.  The gamers at the company are running the
show.  They are amazed that they are getting paid to do this.

Second stage.  A good balance between a hard core vision and fun has
developed.  The gamers at the company are still clearly in charge, although
business concerns are intruding more.

Third stage.  The people with the vision are off to their next project.  
The thinking has shifted to short term.  The game has become just another
thing the company sells.  There are still some gamers working on it, and
occasionally something cool comes through, but the glory days are gone.

I think EQ is somewhere between stage two and three now.
