What they mean is that it takes the same amount of XP to get an
AA as it does to get from 51 to 52.  You still have to get this
by hunting xp giving mobs, greenies will not do.

The reason AA goes faster at higher levels is that you are
hunting higher level mobs (therefore more xp per kill)
at the same speed as you hunt lower level mobs at 51.

Take for example a group of 51's hunting in the Hole 
(great xp spot at that level due to the Hole's high
ZEM of 100).  Kill an elemental crusader (level 45
ish) and you're getting around 40500 xp per shot 
(this is a full group of all 51's to make the math
easier)

Now, take a full group of 61's to PoN at Consorts, where
the mobs range from 59ish (creepers) to 61 or 62 (consorts).
Because the mobs are so close in level to you, you get a
good size bonus per mob.  Kill a level 58 creeper and 
get 215598xp.

As you can see, it takes 1/5 the kills to make an AA in
the second case, and you kill them almost as quick.

As far as Run3 - even though you have SoW, it's worth it.
That extra speed is always there, even in dungeons, very
nice for pullers.
