Hi, 

Hopefully you can help.

Scenario is that I am level 9 Druid and was told not to sell crushbone
belts but to save them and trade them in Kaladim for experience. So I
have saved a hod of belts, travelled to Kaladim and found Canloe
Nusback, but he wont deal with me as he says i am not in the warrior
class guild.

What do I have to do to get him to deal with me (specifically , what
do I have to kill and how many - how do i know when i have killed
enough?) - any dawback from this approach and what will I get for my
64 CB's will it be worth the hassle?

Thanks in advance for your guidance.
All the best.
