I think they exist in DL as well, I met a shamn some time ago who was
the nicest guy, but he refused to buff the tanks past Cel. He was
perma OOM. Then I noticed he wasnt wincing. Turned out he thought that
all shamans could do was Slow, and that he thought thats all he should
do..

After getting him wincing and keeping him topped up in mana with buffs
and heals (I was a cleric). He had more than enough mana for slows
buffs etc.. But he wasnt happy because he was so busy. The tanks sure
were tho.

Some people just like a slower pace of game I guess
