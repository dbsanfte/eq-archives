Hi, 

  I was wondering if anyone here had any experience with the stampede
in Tactics. Last night was the first time I'd ever tried to pull the
piglet and I seem to have run into some kind of bug (or I'm just
missing something). 

  Group is set up in the room between the pit and the pens. Stampede
starts but I can't target the piglet on it's first pass through the
room so we let them run the circuit and I root park the little guy on
his way back through the room since they're more spaced out at that
point. So far so good but now it gets strange. 

  First attempt, I slow and debuff the pig, break root with DD and he
runs a few steps to the doorway to the pens and poofs. OK, maybe I was
out of agro range when I broke root (even though I had to be on his
agro list) and he just ran the wrong way. 

Next time, have him rooted and debuffed and I send in my puppy to pin
him in place while the rest of the group engages. Puppy gets close and
piglet runs off and poofs as soon as he gets to the doorway to the
stables. My root never broke yet he still ran off as soon as puppy got
close.  It might be worth noting that we weren't pulling the pens,
just the daiku down the opposite tunnel and the pit. 

My first inclination is that we rooted him too close to where the
stampede despawns, which seems to be the doorway between our room and
the pens but a groupmember said that they'd used that same strategy
before. 

Anyone know if piglet is just buggy atm and just not worth going
after? 

Is there another place further from the despawn point where a group
can set up and catch him on the way through? 

Is there any way to target him out of the middle of the stampede on
his first run through the room? Stampede is packed too close together
for me to even see him among the big boars but I'm thinking that
something like a '/target a_stampeding_piglet' might work. 

Thanks in advance for any help. 

Rgds, Frank
Anyone have a way to target him out of the stampede on his first pass
through the room?
