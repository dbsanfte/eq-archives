""I wouldn't call this a ban," said Michael
Lustenberger, director of entertainment marketing
for 989 Studios, which with its parent company
Sony Computer Entertainment of America Inc. and
partner Verant Interactive Inc., created and runs
the EverQuest game. "We just want to warn players
to beware. We see a lot of people getting ripped
off........." 

"........And the warning to users may have little
affect, as Lustenberger admits that 989 Studios
will not enforce the rule. "There are probably
some people who are making a living selling
EverQuest characters.""
