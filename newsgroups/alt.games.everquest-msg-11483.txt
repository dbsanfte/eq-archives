Grade it a little..no matter what there will be some people who a) get
attacked ad defend themselves (when controlled by AI this is related to
general feeling, GMs may take more obvious clues eg: Its an Elf Im a dark
elf...as opposed to examing the fact this elf may be amiable to Neriak)
and b) some people who genuinely dont understand what is going on (though
b is rarer)....

Big obvious messages etc etc...possibly a faction hit message (for minor
or at least less faction on hitting these sort of character) to warn
people when they start to hit....duel challenges sent out to those who are
in zone and of amiable status to the GM/NPC so they can get involved, and
then big faction hit if the character is killed??????
