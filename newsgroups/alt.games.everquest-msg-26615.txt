OK, well I'm switching to from ME to 2K. Everthing is working fine except it
seems for everquest. I have 2 problems...

1. Sound. I have a SB Live card and I am using the latest drivers. The sound
is a bit distorted and muffled. Music kind of sounds like it's on an old
adlib sound card.

2. Video. I have Radeon 64Mb graphics card, again with the latest drivers. I
play in full screen mode and it's fine with 2 exceptions. During the initial
low res login screens, I get intermittent flickering of the screen and in
the game when I view the spell book (Set to not change resolutions, so i see
a small book in the middle of the screen) I seem to have an overlay problem.
The book seems to get covered by a darker transparent flickering overlay
which will clear in a few seconds and return a few seconds after that
[Repeats]. Moving the mouse over the darker areas clears a square the size
of the cursor graphic.

All my other games and apps work fine. Perfect sound and video. I have DX 8a
installed.

Any suggestions as to how to cure either of these problems would be much
appreciated.

Thanks,

Jon.
