}This is straight from Rush Limbaugh isn't it?

}Here is what FAIR told him;
}http://www.fair.org/press-releases/limbaugh-debates-reality.html
}"A one in five AIDS risk for condom users? Not

}Institutes of Health. "There is substantive
}evidence that condoms prevent transmission if used
}consistently and properly," he said. He pointed to
}a nearly two-year study of couples in which one
}partner was HIV-positive. Among the 123 couples
}who used condoms regularly, there wasn't a single
}new infection (AP, 8/29/93)."

Just for contrast, here's the report from a collaborative study by The 
National Institute for Health, the Center for Disease Control, The FDA, 
and the US Agency for International Development:

--- http://www.niaid.nih.gov/dmid/stds/condomreport.pdf
Among participants who reported always using condoms, the summary estimate 
of HIV/AIDS incidence from the twelve studies was 0.9 seroconversion per 
100 person years. Among those who reported never using condoms, the 
summary estimate of HIV/AIDS incidence from the seven studies was 6.7 
seroconversions per 100 person years. Overall, Davis and Weller estimated 
that condoms provided an 85% reduction in HIV/AIDS transmission risk when 
infection rates were compared in always versus never users.
---   

So that would be... 15%?  Look, condoms just aren't perfect, and we can 
argue forever about what the appropriate statistic is.

}>  I didn't until I was told so by a navy Hospital Corpsman in
}>boot camp. 
}Really?.. Well I guess that settles it doesn't it?
}A "navy Hospital Corpsman" from "boot camp" told
}you this... between heart transplants, no doubt.
}You have to wonder why anyone would conduct
}clinical trials at all, when this anonymous
}medical genius is available. 

I think from Sanji's point of view, the important fact was that they were 
not 100% effective, which even FAIR doesn't argue with, the actual 
statistic being, rightly, a secondary consideration.  I say props to the 
corpsman for enlightening him.

}> When I was in high school, I was told that the condom would
}>protect me.
}Were you? I doubt it.

Shoot, I don't.  Sex ed has a lot of problems... It's so under seige that 
it's not at all suprising they can't always get the best teachers, is it?

}If so, you were misinformed.

No doubt.

}>  How many students know they're taking a 10% risk of being
}>infected if they're sleeping with an infected person?
}What will students do when they find out you are

}You are suggesting that one in ten of them will

}That is a lie.

Personally, I don't consider it a lie to tell people what you honestly 
believe to be true.  Even if you're wrong.  Even if it's one in seven.  Or 
one in thirty.

There's also an error in assuming that the chance of contracting HIV from 
sleeping with an infected person without protection is 100%, when it's 
actually substantially lower, particularly in heterosexual or lesbian 
encounters.
