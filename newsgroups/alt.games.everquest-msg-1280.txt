OK, I know that these aren't that big of a deal -- I believe my raw silk
gloves may have the same AC, in fact -- but Erudin is the next major
stop on my gnome wiz's trip across Norrath, and I think these would look
excellent on him.

Of course, he can't summon the items needed to get the gloves, so I was
figuring I'd pay a first level Erudite magician to do it for me. How
much should I reasonably expect to have to pay for them? (I figure
that if they don't have both summoning spells, I'll pay for them but
take that out of what I ultimately pay my proxy.)

Likewise, is a Servant's Staff worth getting for a 13th level gnome
wizard?
