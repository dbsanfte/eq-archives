Not only that but you start to get diminishing returns on your DOTs.  A
necro can hit a mob with around 2000/tic (base, a good deal more with
crits and whatnot) with his best two fire DOTs and his best magic DOT.
But after that you start throwing on DOTs that hit for 300 a tic, then
200 a tic, etc. and you aren't adding nearly as much damage per second
as you did when you threw on your best ones.  Best cast scenario I
doubt you are going to realistically apply more than 2500 or so a tic,
base damage.  And of course, as you pointed out, none of this matters
90% of the time because the mob is dead by the time you get the 3rd DOT
on the mob.
