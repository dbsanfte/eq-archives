The whole point of this is, this is just a game! I play this game for the
enjoyment and it really helps me unwind after dealing with all the hassles
of the work day. I understand there are a lot of kids that play this game
and this certainly isn't a baby sitting service. Bottom line is, all these
people that scream and shout about taking their zone or you're not playing
your character right when in their group, just need to shut the fuck up and
play the game and have fun!
