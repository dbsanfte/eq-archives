Well since I lost Bonehand as an allowable Char name, I've tried it on
another Character and had no problems.

Can delete and recreate the Char within seconds without the name server nazi

I'm guessing there may have been a small update to enforce the "No
descriptive First Name" eg Bone & Hand, Tree & Hugger etc
