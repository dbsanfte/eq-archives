    The Shissar were driven off by a green mist, but in the case of the
patch message it means the final Iksar SK quest weapon is in game. Here's
hoping the quest is intriguing - so far we have reports of an NPC in Cabilis
seeking a book from Chardok, and a new set of spawns in the LoIO Sarnak Fort
that includes a blue at 60 named blacksmith that drops a special quest-type
hammer. Here's also hoping that after all the effort and pain that the
resulting weapon is at LEAST as good as a MoSS, so the SK that COULD
complete this quest would actually be tempted to use it.
