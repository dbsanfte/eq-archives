It is real.
What you think this NG is about a game that we ALL imagine exists.
We pay money to SOE and then pretend to play something and ask
questions/make comments/take the piss/or just whine about a game we are all
imagining, collectively.

Those boxes you (sometimes) see on the shelves in game stores, they're
actually empty and sold as empty, all you get is a small piece of paper the
says "Imagine it!"

Sorry to break it to you, EQ is a real game, it exists...we play it. I am
sure many people think us sad for doing it, as they think those that play
other online games are sad too but I have yet to see anyone in tears because
their guild failed to defeat an encounter before their rivals or because
their FPS clan just got knocked out of Div. 1...Yet I have seen grown men do
this over sports teams that they are and never could have been, good enough
to play for..That, though, is considered a healthy interest in something.
