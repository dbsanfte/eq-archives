I just took my lvl 8 bard from Freeport to Qeynos.  I used a haste song and was
able to out run everything that hit me.  

I would say it took me 20 minutes to a half an hour.  

My advice is get a companion to travel with who know the way.  Absent that,
print maps!  I got monumentally lost in Highpass Hold and was almost taken out
by a Gnoll Shaman.

Good luck.
