Another poster said 33%.  Not that it matters, even 25% is a
*horrible* failure rate on something that you supposedly can't

See above.

: you'll run a bigger chance of producing a product that is flawed.

Blah, blah, blah.

:>Wow.  Someone defending the EQ tradeskill system.  You go, Darktyger!

: Wow. Someone dodging the point. You go, Teckla!

What point did I dodge?  I read and disagree with your opinion.

: For the record, I am not now, never have, and likely never will say
: the tradeskill system is perfect. It is, however, adequate.

That's an exaggeration.
