It's clear as sunshine why he is a traitor.

Halflings love company and eating and drinking with good friends.
IE. they are very hospitable.

Rusbeks' full name is Rusbek the inhospitable, therefore he is clearly a
traitor among his people for not wanting to share food and drink willingly
:)
And the fact that he keeps angry wolves around doesn't really make people
want to come visit him often, just ask his neighbours, the Honeybuggers,
they have been trying to get invited for elevenses for months now, only to
be chased off by those wolves of his.. VERY unpleasant!
