    Um, yes, if for no other reason than loot.

    We're happy because they're like us. They want to "win", and not sit
around farming. This guild never did Emperor or Vex Thal, as they figured it
would be a waste of time competing with other guilds over old content when
new stuff (PoP) was available. As you must appreciate, that was a huge
gamble and they had to work very hard to overcome the lack of gear and focus
items.

    So what's the "good person" alternative? Do we meekly leave a mob we
want as well? Do we just FCFS and get called "cockblocking assholes"?
Remember what this rotation agreement allowed: THREE DAYS to start with for
each guild to try as many times as they wanted. It was pretty telling that
when the first guild was up, they went and farmed Ssra before going to try
RZ on day one and two.

    As for "rules your guild didn't have to abide by", um, duh? We went
after the lead encounter instead of sitting in safe, well-known places and
farming phat lewts. We paid for those "unlimited chances" with lost
opportunities elsewhere. And where were the other guilds, who for a period
of about a week or two also could have tried the encounter when we weren't?
You got it - farming Ssra, VT, the freaking Ring of Vulak, all the nice,
safe places they knew well.

    I should suggest to some of your competition to rush one of your raids,
and call it "blocking" when you don't leave the zone and let them have what
you wanted. Then you might see how absurd I find that statement.

    As I pointed out already, you have greatly misunderstood how RZ works.
At NO POINT was he chain-triggerable if you killed him. If he had been, we
would have farmed the crap out of him so all our warriors had that sword and
we could move on with life.

    The rotation was agreed upon after they came to us asking for unlimited
attempts at him. At that point I believe we'd killed him three times, maybe
four.

    AAAAARRRRRRRRGGGHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

    THEY NEGOTIATED WITH US. THEY **** AGREED **** TO THIS ROTATION.

    We didn't WANT a rotation, either! We wanted to kill the thing every
time it popped. But we AGREED to a rotation because we don't want to be the
evil empire, we don't want to block folks for the sake of blocking them. And
WE KEPT OUR END OF THE BARGAIN, even when we KNEW they were about to screw
us.

> Offering them bs deals, or rotations in your favour

    So I'll ask you again, and again, and again until you answer: what
SHOULD we have done, Martin? What would YOU have done? Just FCFS'ed over
them and been blocking assholes? Left? Tell me!

    Now look at our history. First guild on server to kill Cursed, we
offered a rotation before the other guilds had even killed him. First guild
on server to kill Emperor, we offered a rotation before the other guilds had
even killed him. On any other freaking server, these mobs would have been
killed and the people wanting to kill them would have been told to move
faster or lose. We're the ones that move faster, and we don't do that. Does
it sound like we were fucking people over?

    No, it doesn't have to be that way. That's the lie the lazy guilds tell,
why they have to block folks instead of pushing the new encounters hard and
dying repeatedly to them. They wait for the hints from the trailblazers, the
photos of the encounter that show placement, the mistakes that drop big
hints in serverwide channels. (One of our bards once heard another guild's
bard say in serverwide "GET THAT SHIT GATED" when the other guild was known
to be doing RZ. Um, whoops.) We don't want to be that guild. We want to be
with the trailblazers.

> be it stopping the SoD and primal supply

    Funny you mention that one. My guild and the at-the-time top guild had a
rotation agreement on Warders when my guild broke into NToV. The top guild
tried to stop the NToV break, CotH'ing past Aary and eventually causing a
train that brought a GM to mandate a rotation. The very next day, the top
guild killed the fourth Warder. I wasn't part of LC when that happened, but
I remember thinking how petty the other guild was to do it. I was reminded
of it all recently when the monk in that top guild, BotB winner and only
monk on server with a Shroud, got put up on playerauctions.
