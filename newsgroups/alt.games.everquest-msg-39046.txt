A moss I think. My sk uses a moss and at 32 its still my best damage
really though I have a couple kinda good 2 hands also ( like an argent
defender, 49 spd 33 dam) 

I want to get a wurmslayer though to have a fairly good one hand to
keep that skill high until I get a Noc (which would replace both,
being a bit faster than the moss but otherwise rather similar)

For one thing, your iksar sk has issues which my troll would not such
as weight and stamina loss which kind of makes the wurmslayer bad for
you anyway I'd guess.

There, better? ;)

moss is 1.53   (29 / 19)

wurm is 1.6  (40 / 25) 

Which is the way I like to do it (speed divide by dam), smaller number
is better. I think its done the other way too.. with dam divided by
speed then higher is better?

Moss 0.655

Wurm 0.625

With one hand there is no bonus at 40 spd or whatever like with 2
hand, as far as I know.
