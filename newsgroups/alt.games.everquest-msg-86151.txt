The standard tradeskills have no level based cap.  They do have a cap of 250
for one tradeskill, then 200 for all other tradeskills you learn, i.e. only
one tradeskill can go over 200.  Specialized tradeskills, like Alchemy, have
a level based skill cap, in the case of Alchemy it is (level-24)*5 I
believe.
