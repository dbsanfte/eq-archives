   I like having more than one character, as you can
see by my sig.  True, they are all low(ish) levels,
but even now I can get a hint of the different playing
issues between, say, a warrior and a enchanter.  It's
nice, for me at least, to be able to switch between
characters with vastly different abilities.  Yes, I 
know that this means that it will take me much longer
to get any of them to their 30's, but I'm okay with
that.

Annie  <--- Not planning on starting any others in the
            near future.
