I've pretty much decided that I'm actually a massively masochistic
troll, and I'm going to undertake the Spirit of Garzicor quest. (Insert
howling laughter and pointing fingers here. Imagine getting
blacksmithing up over 200 with my Troll's INT/WIS. /sigh ) 

I've read up on it, and most of the mobs that require killing over the
long course of this quest are easily doable by my guild. The one big
question mark is the Armor of Zek. I'd never even heard of it until I
read up on this quest. I understand it spawns near the statue in Kael
and he's level 55.  To give you an idea of our capabilities, we can do
the PoZ pretty easy, but have not tried Vindi which we think is beyond
us, and can definitely not do the statue yet.

So... with that in mind, what can you Kael raiders tell me about this
armor? Is it in a spot we could pull, (I've never even seen the area.
Only our monks go there. I'm always waiting back at the corner with the
raid to tag them as they come in.) Even is we can handle it, is it
always up? Do you have to trigger it or something?

Any helpful information on this mob will be most appreciated. TIA.
