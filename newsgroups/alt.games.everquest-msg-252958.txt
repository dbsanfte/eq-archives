Mages have no trouble soloing him (in the 60s) as well.

I found the pally spell worth it actually. I went down there alone
with some invis potions. No problem whatsoever until I got to Phinny's
room (he wasn't up). One of the horsies did see invis but he spent so
much time casting at me I just grabbed the bone and instagated out.
