Only idiots do Ornate Chain past around 130. At 150 level you should
be doing straight Fine Plate until 188. Even though you do have to
collect the leather padding for it, either bought or made, the sell
back for Fine Plate is ~ the cost of ore and molds. So that's
basically your only cost on a success and with geerlok you won't fail
a lot. Ornate shit sell back is roughly half cost and therefore you'll
take a bloodbath every combine. I had runs of 40 Fine Plate combines
that would cost me a couple hundred pp.
