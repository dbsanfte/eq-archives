Sounds even better than mine :) I get ovals (tilted according to my
astigmatism) that are quite a bit larger than the real light, and look
kind of gritty. If there are several point lights around, the grit
pattern looks the same in all of them. If I blink, I can see
components of the tear layer stream over the gritty image of the
light, and once when I stared at a light without blinking, the grit
seemed to turn into little 3d worms as the tear layer broke up.

Damn right I don't need drugs for hallucinatory stuff ;)
