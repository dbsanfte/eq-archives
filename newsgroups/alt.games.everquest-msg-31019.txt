It was a two-parter.  Tried as adult, and death penalty.  So you're saying
that on a case-by-case basis you're willing to try a 6-yr-old as an adult if
he was evil enough.   Good enough, that's all I was asking for.  I don't
really care about the 2nd part...there's a lot more people willing to try
kids as adults than would possibly consider putting them to death so to me
it's almost a non-issue.

But since you seem to think it's damned near impossible for a 6-yr-old to be
that evil (I agree), at what age is the minimum that you can realistically
see a kid being bad enough and mature enough to try as an adult?
