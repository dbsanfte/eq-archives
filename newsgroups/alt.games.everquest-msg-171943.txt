I suspect that Gary was gently poking u89s for the same error you just

made:  equating the world-wide-web (i.e. access to http servers) with
the internet.  Access to internet email/usenet <is> access to the
internet.  In fact, email/usenet and ftp servers were, afaik, the
features driving the steady expansion of old ARPANET into what came to
be "the internet".  It was only after substantial expansion of coverage
and bandwidth that the web came into being, and its rapid gain in
popularity then became the force driving subsequent dramatic increases
in available bandwidth.
