From the Developer's Corner:

..........................................

Beginning May 1, monthly EverQuest fees will increase from the current
$12.95 to $15.95, plus $1.00 per month for every character logged in
more than two times for periods of two hours, 15 minutes or more,
every three days, except on holiday weekends where the period would be
four days. A seven-cent break per character is available for the
months of February, June, and December; however, the break only comes
in to effect if the player's account has more than five characters on
it.

So far, no official reason has been given for the increase.

In other news, April Fools has been declared an international holiday.






PS before you flame me, read the last line closely =)
