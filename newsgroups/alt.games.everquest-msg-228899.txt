Didn't say it was the be all and end all, but the flexibility alone should
move them up the list.  They should not be considered below average as a
group mate.

Again, flexible.  And I don't see them as below the average.

I won't argue with you on the warriors being inferior to paladins and SKs as
tanks, now.  I should not have added them.  The last time I played a warrior
with any regularity was a Kunark era Troll warrior I played to 60 and then
retired.  And I can see a ranger for DPS, but if a tank is needed and you
have one open slot, what do you take?  The warrior can take a beating and
keep on going much longer than a ranger.  (ranger hotkey: /g Heal, /pause
20, /Heal me again!, /pause 20, /g Can I get a rezz?)

Not quite what I said.  Every situation is different.  Every class has
positives and negatives.  And the class that brings more to the table to
take a role in the group is, imo, more desirable than below average.

Would I want a group of 5 enchanters and one monk (now, that group would be
sushi)?  No way.  But as long as the group can work through the limitations
they may have, I'd go with anything.  4 Warriors, 1 druid, and a bard?  Why
not?  Turn the warriors into necros?  Hell yeah.  I need to try that one
out.
