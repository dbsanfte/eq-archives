Actually, it worked pretty well.  I only saw one or two
during the evening that he "lost" that way.

First, he was pretty good about poking one skeleton, then
shifting to the next.

Second, game aggro is designed so that any one person
won't have more than 3 mobs actively smacking him at any
given time.  Well, they might if you stand in the middle
of a batch, but if you move over a few feet only 3 will
follow you, the rest will either stand and wait their turn
(unless you get *too* far away, at which point they run
towards you but stop again at the "I'll wait here until
you're not so busy" radius), or they'll go bug someone
else they don't like (like the members of our PL-crew --
we kept getting annoyed by the "spares").

So most of the time, only 3 mobs were actually taking
DS damage from him, and it was pretty easy for him
to make sure those three each took some damage from
his pokey-stick before they expired.  (Then repeat
with their replacements, etc.)
