Does anyone know if attempts to bash take away from possible attempts to
attack with primary weapon?

Also, if you are trying to cast, doesn't that take away from attempts to
attack with primary weapon?

Is there a way to do an "auto-bash" type of control?

Is Dodge a passive skill in melee or does one have to actively hit a button
to attempt it?

Thanks for any help.
