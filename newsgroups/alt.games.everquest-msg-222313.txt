Not really.

A large number of people have problems balancing their commitments; and 
EQ can be very demanding of your time if you let it. (Obligations not to 
stop playing and screw over your group, obligations to show up to guild 
events, obligations not to leave guild events or ldon missions.

Combine that with online relationships that can develop a bizarre 
intensity, as inhibitions are dropped because of the anonmity and 
perceived control of the situation. ("I can just pull the plug if it 
gets out of control").

At the end any hobby or activity which causes a spouse or emplyee to 
start neglecting other aspects of their life and obsess over it will 
lead to lost jobs and broken marriages but EQ is uniquely suited to 
created obsessed employees because there is increased potential for 
'virtual infidelity'; there is a very real 'call' to play; and their is 
a very real call not to leave. Few other hobbies or games can demand 
your time like this, and of the few that do, none are a bottomless 
timesink.

Your hockey league team mates might expect you to show up at practice 
and for games... but it can never get to the point where your playing 18 
hours a day 7 days a week...

Its not 'EQs' fault per se. But nonetheless it is uniquely qualified to 
manufacture 'junkies'. The marriage / job could very well have been on 
solid ground; not much can survive a junkie.
