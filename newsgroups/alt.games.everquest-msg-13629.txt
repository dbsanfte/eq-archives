The qeustion is, how much effort is involeved?  Did Verant use better
encryption for the password than the did for game information?  Here's
what we know about Verant encryption:

1. The system used to encrypt mob information is weak.  I don't think
the ShowEQ people have ever taken more than a couple of days after
Verant changes it to get ShowEQ working again.

2. I seem to recall that the key exchange between the server and client
*is* done very well, and is very secure.

3. Good algorithms are available that would be fast enough for Verant's
needs (Twofish should be fast enough) and have a large enough key to
prevent the brute force attack that ShowEQ currently uses.

So, from #2, we know that Verant has someone who knows something about
good encryption.  From #1 and #3, we also know that Verant has some
people working on the encryption stuff that don't know enough about good
encryption.

Who did the password encryption?  The #2 person, or the #1/#3 people?

This is what I mean when I ask if you trust Verant's password encryption.
I note that the username is sent in the clear when logging in, and
that's not a good sign.
