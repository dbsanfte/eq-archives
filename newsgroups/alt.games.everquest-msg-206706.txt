I expect the mechanic in use is simpler and more reliable than that.
One easy way would be to have variant mobs in the spawn table, which
the players can not distinguish, which have much different chances
of having loot, and the low loot frequency mobs are far more likely
to despawn spontaneously (i.e. no player action involved).  That way
the longer the zone sits idle the richer the pickings become.  An
equivalent alternative would be to have lootless mobs (or mobs with
specific "junk" loot like wisps with burned-out stones) be subject to
spontaneous despawn while those with loot are not.  Something along
these lines is needed to explain what I've seen in a number of less
popular zones.
