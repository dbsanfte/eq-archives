Iksar have become favorable now in all their classes, due to the new
quest armor, new Planar armor, and even being able to wear 90% of the
Velious gear.  What you end up with is a Warrior who at a given level
will out AC most other warriors of similar gear.  What does that do?  Not
much.  AC IMHO will always be the secondary stat next to STA and HP for a
warrior/SK/Paladin.  So yes, an Iksar makes a quite viable Warrior.
