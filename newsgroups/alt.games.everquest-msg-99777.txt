You are incorrect, they most certainly have said that it will take
about the same amount of "effort", not just "exp":

   "We don't plan on releasing detailed mechanics - Some
   things people should really discover for themselves
   as part of normal gameplay. The goal was to smooth
   the path from 30 to 50, not to make it require less
   overall gameplay, or happen faster. The intent wasn't
   to get people from 30 to 50 any faster. 

   "The overall path isn't any easier to reach level
   50 -- a retroactive experience boost wouldn't really
   be called for. Down the line of what I said at the last
   fan faire, "If we did something with hell levels, we
   would have to find a fair solution that didn't affect
   anyone's existing experience or progress."

   "We found that solution."

   -- Scott Hartsman

In fact, I have yet to see anyone quote Verant to the effect
that only the "exp required" will remain constant.

"If"...

Which "past history" is that -- all of their "past history" is that
they'll go through a lot of effort *not* to hand us exp or levels on
a silver platter.

The longer people take to level to 60, the longer they play the
game, and the longer Verant collects their monthly fees.
They may be willing to give us a lot in the way of in-game "freebies",
but shortening our gaming cycle is not likely to be one of them.

Probably because they don't want to be nitpicked to death,
or have to spend two months re-explaining the math to the
slower members of the player community.  I still remember how
many times they had to do that just to quell some folks'
freak-outs over their misunderstandings of the hybrid experience
penalty removal, and the change in how group exp was split.

And those were simpler changes than the reshaping of the
whole exp curve.  It's simpler for Verant just to say, "we
fixed it, so there", than to explain the math, show the multipliers,
explain how using the old exp curves internally is irrelevant
if the "exp earned" multipliers make a new "virtual curve",
etc., then have 20,000 players go, "huh????"

Ahem.  See above.  They have indeed *specifically* said that
they don't want it to "happen faster" or "require less gameplay"
or be "any easier".

It would be almost as easy to fix them the right way -- just
apply adjustment multipliers to all 1-50 levels instead of only
the hell levels.  How much harder is *that*?

Furthermore, tests done by folks with ShowEQ have now revealed
that yes, Virginia, non-hell levels *are* harder now, in just
about exactly the amount necessary to make up for the "free ride"
through the hell levels.
