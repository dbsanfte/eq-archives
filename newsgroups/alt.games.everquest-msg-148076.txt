No,  I wouldn't reckon so.  I am not swamping the server to stop
others getting access to the one pixel file.  All I am doing is to
read the file that they WANT me to read without my knowing.

I am just helping them.

This all came about because, as you come from the UK, you will realise
that most people don't have unmetered internet connection.  A few
people on the racing mailinglist, which I am a member of, were
complaining that everytime that they opened a certain e-mail their
modem would connect them to the interenet costing them money.

Looking into this this was because the mailing list crew shoved in
adverts at the footer which contained a link for one pixel file.
Now, in a galaxy far, far awat, where BT doesn't run the network, this
wouldn't be a problem.   So, I gathered these URLs for these one pixel
files and then started to look at them.

It could be argued that they are the ones who are impinging on us;
they are the ones costing people real money.  I am just helping to,
ahem, 'improve' their advertisement hit rates.  That's all.

Have I any intention of performing a DoS (Denial Of Service)?
Absolutely not.  On the contrary I want to make sure that their server
stays up and running so that someone can't work out how many
successful hit that advert had.

Or as I have suggested before; I am such a helpful person that I want
to improve their advertising figures and, I think, that they ought to
thank me.
