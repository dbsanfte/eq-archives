He He  - I just bought Black and White here the other day, and I must say,
so far it is a very intriguing and involved game. The cinematography and
scoring are great - and of course there's lots of dry British humor there to
crown off the programmers finesse! First game I've bought since I began my
EQ addiction (1.5 yrs.) - and I must say it is worth playing indeed ! It
also makes patch days that I am off from work much more bearable.
