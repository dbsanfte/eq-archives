I don't deal with GMs often, but this made me wonder about the story.  It's 
a good read, and if it happened, I'm ever-so-happy the fucks got their due.  

As strict as Verant is on most things, I can't see a GM actually telling 
anyone not only what they did to punish, but also the length of the 
punishment.
