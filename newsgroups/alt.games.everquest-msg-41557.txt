 Just as a follow-up... These sphinxes are not nice. I was passing
through Rathe Mountains the other day so decided to try Ankhenmut.
Remembering my last bout with the beast I donned as much MR gear as I
had with me at the time and headed up the dead-end. I pulled with my
dispelling staff and proceeded to whack the critter with my stick. I was
nuked, chain-stunned and charmed (max 10 seconds). Attempt one and two I
had to feign. The third I was finially successful, finishing at under a
bubble of health. 

 So, you may be able to solo these but it will be tough. Perhaps a
kiting class would have an easier time. I went at him as a 60 monk with
about 2400 HPS, 1120 AC, 105 MR, a 40/35 stick and 80% self-haste. Nasty
beasts.
