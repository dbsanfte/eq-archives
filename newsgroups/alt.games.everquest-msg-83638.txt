OK... here's some contradictory info here. 

You were invited to participate in a guild raid. Why weren't you aware
of it well before hand? No message board? Or you don't read it?

Ah. You had to turn on the guildchat. Why on earth was it off? I only
turn it off while in the middle of a serious raid where I do not wish
the distraction- like my first dragon raid. But I make sure I *tell*
them first. And if it's a guild raid- oh yeah, it stays on- as that form
of communication can be vital.

If you are in a guild, you ought to be aware of what is said in guild
chat and on the message boards. Otherwise, why be in it?

Turning down a guild raid for a steady camp is understandable- but you
should try to make the effort to go to a guild raid if you have one
planned and are the level for it. These should be your friends. Why not
go have a good time with them?

You do not ask him "why he cannot stand you". You ask why he is saying
anything that he is. And you listen. You try to discuss, not accuse. You
look like a better person than that schmuck that way.

To be removed from the guild, some officer had to be in the zone with
you.

Damn odd when there's a raid going on elsewhere.

If you didn't care what they were saying in guildchat before the
incident, why the fuck should you care now? 

Think long and hard about what you want out of a guild and what a guild
ought to be doing for you before you join another one. You may be better
off without that tag.
