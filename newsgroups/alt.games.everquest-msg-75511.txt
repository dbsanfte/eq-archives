   Nasty.  I like the way you think. 
   My husband and I were bouncing around some fun ideas last
night after reading this thread.  His was that after you
attack
a SB your soul becomes permantely "unbound".  You never know
where you're going to spawn when you die or gate.  The
middle
of Misty Thicket, the bottom of the LoIO, somewhere in the
Hole.
It would make for some interesting CR's to be sure.
   But I have a bigger mean streak than he does.  After you 
attack for, oh, say five minutes or so (to protect the poor
souls that forget to change the auto attack key), the SB
should
perma-bind you right in front of him, then become KOS to
you.
He should hit like a Nexus Scion.  I mean, the exploiters
like
attacking a defenseless target, might as well give
on-lookers 
the same thrill... over and over again.
    But in reality, what I think Verant will probably end up
doing is just make 'em hit like the Scions, and leave it at 
that.
