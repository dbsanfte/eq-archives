PC Sumonned pets only. Good thing too. Can you imagine the havoc as 
people charmed mobs and let them loose in other zones (with a random

That would just be *bad*.

I'm curious how the Summon Monster line is going to work... are they 
just going to reassign models on zone or do these not cross boundaries 
either?
