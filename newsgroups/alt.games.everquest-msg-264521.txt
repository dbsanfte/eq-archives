The problem people have with KSing seems to be that if they have a 
slow-killing hero they get snarked while street hunting and thus wind up 
with less than decent xp for their effort, right?

So just do missions. With a "slow" build, you'll get the same XP as you 
will in street hunting, and you won't wind up getting aggrivated with 
KS'ers.

If the build you're using is too "slow" to handle missions, then you're 
probably going to want to team, at which point getting KS'd isn't an 
issue since your team will be destroying stuff quickly.

I don't have problems with KSing because I only street-hunt with a fast 
killing build OR a slow-killing build but part of a team. When I want to 
solo with a slow build, I do missions, and all is well with the world.

Plus, I think I run into kill stealers very rarely when I'm out of the 
newbie zones. I think I've maybe run into 1 kill stealer in Steel Canyon 
or other zones at that level. Any other time someone's zapped something 
I was fighting it was an isolated incident and they apologized.
