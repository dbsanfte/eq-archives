Depends on what the aim of the guild is.   Our guild on the AB server
has a reputation of being one of the better guilds on there.  This is
because our aim is to have fun rather than to go out and nuke things.

This is the guild which brought about the first instance of the
inter-guild olympic games which was well received at the time.  So,
for serious players who want fun ours is one of the better ones.  For
those who want to be 'ubers' then ours is one of the worst.

Depends on one's requirements and point of view, I reckon.
