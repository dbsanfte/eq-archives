*twitch*  Say, I think Verant should start up a brand new set of servers 
for AOLers.  Like for the Mac players.

Please?

See?  Like I said, a seperate server for AOLers ;)

And to be fair to Taras, he didn't advocate buying chars because he 
wants to be 'uberer', he advocated it because he doesn't have the time 
to play that he'd like.  Even when I spend several of my days off 
online, I still find it's just not enough to keep up with the crowd, so 
I can see his point - but I'd argue that that just means he and I and 
others like us need a different game, not a way to let all the eBayers 
in for cheaper.
