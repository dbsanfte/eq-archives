If you have a guild mate or friend around level 30 you could ask them
to help you kill the Ghoul Messenger in Western Karana. He drops a map
as part of a quest, http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/quest.html?quest=405,
and the reward is a nice 1hs no-drop Ranger only weapon, the Short
Sword of Morin. it is 6 22, with +3 Str, +3 Agi. This quest also leads
into an even better one, for the Orc Impaler, a very nice 7 23 +3 Str,
+4 Wis, +10 hp piercer.
