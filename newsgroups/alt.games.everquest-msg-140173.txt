Head north to skyfire. There are 2 good places to fear kite there that i
know...
1) In the bw corridor. They path north, so pull them wall back before you
start.
2) Eastern wall just north of the OT zone. Again, they path north... so this
keep them close to the wall and away from the other mobs. The mobs here are
a little higher level than near BW. Be careful of the elder wyverns as the
level 51 ones will summon, and still be blue to you.

None of the common spawns (nothing at all?) in skyfire outruns jboots or
enhanced movement.
