Sorry, my newsread fucked up the previous post of mine.
Yes, an SK would be safer than a necro, although a necro would still be 
safe enough. If all he does is fear (and snare if there's nobody else to 
do it), he's usually all set. The pet and other melees will generate 
enough hate to offset that.
On the other hand, the damage from a pet would be at least comparable to 
the damage of an SK, and necro's fear is likely to last longer
