If the police find the murder weapon and find that you are the registered
owner and have not reported it stolen there is a good chance you will be
arrested.  You may then tell them you loaned it to your buddy and they may
go arrest him instead.  But either way, you're not getting your gun back.
Just like when someone loans their gun out and becomes partly responsible
for what happens to the extent that the gun may be confiscated, so it is
with your account.
