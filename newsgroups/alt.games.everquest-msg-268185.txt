Yes and no. The origin of A$$, is as you say to avoid filters, but this 
is not in quite the same catogory as 3lit3 d00d sp34k.

Its merely another manifestation of a group of people trying to be 
'special', on par with any other "youth dialect".

In d00d sp34ks case, its was primarily perpetrated by script kiddies 
posturing as hackers; the more obtuse the spelling, and the more numbers 
ad ascii symbols they could incorporate the more elite they were. 

On many levels its not much different from the segment of the rap crowd 
posturing as gangsters, bragging out their ho's, bling, ride, rep, and 
how they'll bust a cap in you if you so much as 'disrepect' them.

True. But that isn't dewd speak.
