I imagine hell levels are NOT there... hell levels were an artifact of 
too little granuality in the change of the slope of the xp curve.

Still and all, I think that there is a great deal of 'experience 
expedience' in EQ 1 these days. And, to pardon the punnishness, earning 
experience does get easier with experience.

When our group first went through the low 20s in FF, we were getting a 
level every couple of serious xp nights (meaning twice a week at the 
rate we play, yes we are kinda casual). While working on sub/alt jobs we 
did from early 19th to almost through 21st on one night the other night. 
And our group was much less 'optimal' than our 'main' group was, and our 
equipment isn't really as good as it was.
Original group:
Warrior/thief (tank)
Monk/warrior (damage dealer, backup/off tank)
Monk/warrior (damage dealer, backup/off tank)
White Mage/black mage (healer, debuffer, nuker)
Red Mage/Warrior (debuffer, about the same melee damage as the war, 
nuker, emergency heals)
Thief/Monk (Middling Damage dealer, and loot enhancer)

Current 20s group
Warrior/red mage (Tank.. rdm brings much less to the table than thief as 
a sub. he has about 4 heals on full mana)
Dark Knight/Warrior (Damage Dealer, not as good as a monk (I make that 
claim having consistently out damaged a dark knight 4 levels higher than 
my monk, with more than 10x my value in gear, through a week of doing 
missions and quests. It may change in another 20+ levels.), though she 
thinks she is. Oh and she can't hit worth shit either. but that's a gear 
issue more than class issue. Oh I should mention she tries to tank from 
time to time. BAAAD Idea.)
Black Mage/White Mage (Nuker, healer, debuffer. Works as main healer, 
using tinyheals(tm). Actually just got cure II I think, so better now. 
Only thing going is the Olympic sized mana pool.)
Samurai/Red Mage (somewhere between dark knight and 'everyone else' 
Damage dealer, backup/off tank, emergency heals... like 6 of them on 
full mana, which will about heal all of the hp... of the blm/whm.)
Dragoon/Warrior (Middling damage dealer, with decent pet. dire emergency 
offtank)
Black mage/warrior (nuker... with mana pool size of a thimble due to 
race (Galkan) and bad bad subjob choice)

The only good news in that group is even though the warrior couldn't 
hold agro in a bucket, no one does enough damage to really piss things 
off much, unless the black mage really lets loose. Or when I whip out my 
first round Weapon Skills (I'm the samurai... yes red mage sucks as a 
sub... with our healer it's saved our lives though)
