Playing a good enchanter is much harder than these inconveniences.

Verant has this silly(?) philosophy; HEY, GO OUT AND SEE THE WORLD.

Enchanters are a grouping class...I'd suggest making friends, perhaps join a
guild if needed, and politely ask a porting druid guild member if they could
help you out...or hell, to just buy the spell for you, if you don't want to
get it yourself.
