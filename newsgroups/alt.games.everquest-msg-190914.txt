I couldn't remember if /loot was in there and was too lazy to check.

The other bit was more for targetting mob corpses from the command line,
since it's non-obvious that "/target a decaying skeleton's corpse" will
work. I actually have such a hotkey setup for when I'm farming decaying
skeletons or bonecrawler hatchlings that targets the mob's corpse and loots
it. And specifically, if you put the "'s corpse" bit at the end, you'll
only get *corpses* rather than any matching live mobs which happen to be
close by.
