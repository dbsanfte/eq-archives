Speaking of the AC...had the availability of tboots cut down on demand
for the AC?  Or has it led to a flood of 30-40's hoping that the 50+'s
are all gone now?

I've had my jboots since level 38 or so, but am thinking of going back
for another Ring, this time to wear.  (For you who are not INT casters,
the Ring of the Ancients is +5 INT, and it is wrist slot.  +5 INT is
quite good for the wrist slot.  (You'd think a ring would be finger
slot, but remember, this is a ring for a cyclops, so it makes sense that
it would be wrist slot of much smaller beings)).
