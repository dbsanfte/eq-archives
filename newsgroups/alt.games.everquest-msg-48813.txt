Some players will create a seperate character, or "alt", to hold items
for sale. This "vendor" is generally taken to whichever zone on that
particular server is the accepted "main auction" zone and left there
forever. This reduces the amount of inventory clogging up the main
character's bank and backpacks, amongst other advantages. 

This process is much more difficult, if not impossible, without a
trusted helper to move loot from the main character to the vendor.
