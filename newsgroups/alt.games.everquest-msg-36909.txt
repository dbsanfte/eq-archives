Ah, would that be a thread that bizbee actually *started* then?  No, I
didn't think so.  If you had actually read my post I was talking more about
this asshole jumping in on everything with flameflower in hand rather than
actually *constructing* an on-topic thread himself.

Now, Sandjumper, don't worry about my contributions so much.  I've been
wading through bizbee's carnage for nearly 4 years now in one forum or the
other and it gets fucking old after awhile.  You, on the other hand, don't
know jack shit about my contributions anywhere other than here - as
evidenced by your attack on me.

Now, oh mighty Sandjumper, please refer me to the posts where I'm 'just
rabidly flaming other posters'.  I'd like EXACT quotes of those postings
too.  Let me help you start that list - bizbee (oh and maybe his lackeys
Dark Tyger and Lokari - although I killfiled them straight off when
resubscribing here based on past performance - bizbee was a nobrainer).

I like you better when you were talking about something you actually know
about like EQ, rather than trying to be a flaming asshole defending the
like.
