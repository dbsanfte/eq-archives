I was looking at the Level 16 spells available to the necros, and it says
that Restless Bones was available either by researching it, or buying it
from the Paineel SK guild (among other guilds).  Can't find it in the SK
guild...has anyone seen it there (or anywhere in Paineel)?

Also, what drops words for research?  Do all mobs have a chance of dropping
them at level 16?  Think I'm going to start the practice research quest...is
it worth it?

Thanks,

JD
