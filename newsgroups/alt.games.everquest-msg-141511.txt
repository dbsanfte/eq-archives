For the most part, you don't get awesome stuff that you can use directly via
hunting at your level.  As the game has matured, there has been a lot of
trickle-down of good stuff from higher levels, leading to the present
situation, where the "normal" equipment at a given level is generally stuff
that comes from mobs that are quite a bit higher than that level.
