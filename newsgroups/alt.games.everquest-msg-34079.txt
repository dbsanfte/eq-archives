Could have done worse than /auction.
Read one of the more recent threads (reply was posted 8/17/2001) to "stupid
moves" and you'll see a story about a Barbarian Warrior who was in Everfrost
to do the langseax quest and did the following (copy/paste from that reply).

I finally find Iceberg, when my buddy zones into
Everfrost and promptly sends an /ooc message ( why he just didn't ask me,
I'll never know... ) of...

"Who do I give head to?"

At least "Loveslave" didn't do that.
