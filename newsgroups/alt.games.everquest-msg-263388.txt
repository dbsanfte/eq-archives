Contrary to the above atatement, death is not a BITCH.  Once again I 
reiterate, it took less than 30 minutes to recoup any penalty lost.  As for 
the penalty to equipment and damage dealt, it is minimal and does not affect 
gameplay.  Many players that I grouped with would leave four and five shards 
in different zones KNOWING that it did not degrade you skills enough  to 
affect game play.

The death penalty is a farce, an illusion, a joke. It is designed to not 
upset little Johnnie to the point of quitting the game.  Death was designed 
to keep players from quitting, NOT to make the game more enjoyable.  Items 
become a joke because they were handed to you on a silver platter. There is 
no RISK.  None.

But hey, don't take my word for it.  Go to the Beta boards.  Read what the 
other players have to say.  You will find out that most agree with me.
