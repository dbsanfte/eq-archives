No, you are confused about how this works.  There are two different issues
here, one is if you are worried about skill increases, then, by all means,
you should use a fast weapon.  The second issue is damage output.  The speed
of the weapon is immaterial, it is the damage to delay ration that matters.
It doesn't matter how many "rolls" you get against your dual wield, you will
get the same percentage of successful "rolls" no matter how often they
occur.  So, lets say a 60 second battle.  You can wield a 10/15 weapon, or a
21/30 weapon.  The 10/15 weapon does a dual wield check every 1.5 seconds.
The 21/30 weapon does a check every 3 seconds.  Let's say that you have a
25% chance of success on the dual wield.  Then in the course of 60 seconds,
you will get approximately 40 "rolls" with the 10/15 weapon, with the 21/30
weapon you will get approximately 20 rolls.  With a 25% chance at success
that means about 10 hits with the 10/15, and about 5 hits with the 21/30.
Total damage over 60 seconds, with 10/15 is 100, with the 21/30 is 105.
Which one is better for damage output over time?  So, unless my main concern
is skill increases, I will use the slower weapon, because I will produce
more damage that way.  There is a third consideration, and that is aggro
generation, if I am interested in generating more aggro, I will use the
faster weapon, because aggro is based on the number of hits more than the
amount of damage.
