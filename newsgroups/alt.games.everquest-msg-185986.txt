That's hardly a low budget, unless you are trying to twink your
character with truly high end or very rare gear.

Has anyone heard of players that have over 1,000,000 plat?  Someone
in-game was telling me a few weeks ago that there was a millionaire's
club on Brell Serillis server.  This guy was telling me there are some
players with over 20 million plat.

I'll believe it when one of these players drop a paltry 100,000 plat
on me.
