Actually perm deterior will work in the right game such as
UO or it would seem DAOC. The only key to it working is to have
normal, crappy to very good items which rot but which are not uber
rare or uber items. It only won't work in a game like EQ where you
take forever to do the wurmslayer quest or your epic or to get a cloak
of flames or something even MORE rare so of course it rotting would be
horrible. 

IN a balanced game with GOOD stuff instead of UBER RARE its not an
issue so deteriorating works.
