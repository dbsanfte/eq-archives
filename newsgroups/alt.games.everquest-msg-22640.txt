Woot!  Can you think of any other game that has given you so much
play time?  Still, every game runs out of steam sometimes.  Perhaps it's
time to move on, or at least take a month or two off.

Yup.  If advancing a character is your thing, then this is pretty much
the game - find someone to kill stuff with, kill stuff.  Sometimes
sell/buy equipment.

If you like hanging out with friends, helping them with tough quests, 
and doing silly things like putting mid-level items on decaying
skeletons, the game has a bit more variety.  Still, eventually you'll
feel like you've done everything that interests you.  

Everquest doesn't have an official endpoint.  You never win or lose the
game.  This is good, because you can play as long as you like without
hitting the end and having to stop before the fun is gone.  It's bad
because there's no reminder to stop playing when it's not fun anymore.

That's what this group is for - to remind you not to play if it's not
fun.  EQ is only a computer game, real life and other games beckon.
