Okay my druid is well liked by most of the people in the good cities.

Qeynos Guards kindly
Qeynos Merchants amiable
Surefall Glade amiable
Corrupt Qeynos glaring
HH Guards glowers

I have killed Chandra Miller (in QH) maybe 5 times total. Sir Morgan scowls
at me now, I believe he was indifferent before.  According to Alakazams
faction table, he is on
Karana Residents
Guards of Qeynos
Knights of Thunder
Priests of Life

I don't understand how I could have gone from amiable to scowls with just 5
kills on the Millers.  I have killed more bandits than I care to admit to
(paid for level 19 and 24 spells).  I do the sash quest every time I get
one.  Has anyone else had this problem and what is the easiest way to fix
it?
