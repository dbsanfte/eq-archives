Pff. Balanced.

}� Enchanter
}Overpowered

Pre level 60:
Underpowered

With DC or KEI
Balanced

With both KEIand DC
Put down the nerf bat slowly, and keep your hands where I can see them. :)

}� Monk
}Slightly Overpowered

Was slightly overpowered, seriously underpowered after the recent nerf.

}� Rogue
}Slightly Overpowered

Balanced

}� Necromancer
}Slightly Overpowered, mostly because soloing is so easy an idiot can do it
}and they still bring a lot to an exp group, snare, mez

Really can't say.  They're smart enough to keep quiet. :)

}� Bard
}Balanced

What you don't see can't hurt you. :)

More or less agree with the rest.  You left out Beastlord.  Probably 
overpowered, but nobody has one, so it isn't an issue. :)
