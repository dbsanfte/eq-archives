If you've started a rouge character you should be focusing on keeping 
your cosmetic application and glamour modelling skills up to maximum and 
stay away from fighting at all costs! Fighting only exposes you to the 
risks permanent scarring and often you end up crying after a fight which 
totally ruins your make-up. Remember, rouge is only one part of the 
whole artistic masterpiece that is your beautiful face.

If you really feel the need to pick locks as a rouge character its 
understandable, since the price of good cosmetic goods these days are 
beyond what most can afford on an honest salary. However, remember that 
as rouge character your appearances must be your priority at all times, 
including your hands and nails. Picking locks risks breaking your lovely 
nails! You are probably better off doing the old 
go-home-with-victim-take-all-clothes-off-handcuff-to-bedpost-then-make-off-with-wallet 
trick.
