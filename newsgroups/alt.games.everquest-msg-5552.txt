WIS / MANNA / AC / AGI 

CHA is arguably important for druids.  However, my druid is L51 and 
has yet to ever charm an animal for any other reason but checking it 
out.

If you are a kiter go with WIS/MANNA.  If you are heavily into 
grouping lean a little into AC/AGI items.  You'll find being able to 
get that evac or heal off uninterrupted is valuable.  You can pretty 
much forget about DEX as whether or not your weapon procs should never 
be important in a fight for you.  If it IS, you're doomed.
