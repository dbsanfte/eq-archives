The children of some friends of mine (one male, one female) have
written letters to their parents saying things are in chaos.  Life in
Iraq is stress 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, wondering when the
next car driving down the road will be a suicide car bomber, or
wondering if there's an RPG-wielding terrorist over the next rise.

I guess it all depends on which soldiers you talk to.  What makes it
more tragic is these two kids are the only kids this couple has.  I'm
dissapointed the Bush administration would allow both to be sent into
Iraq at the same time.  It displays a kind of insensitivity in the
Bush administration in my opinion.  But, as long as George W. Bush
isn't sending his kids, or the kids of his rich friends, I guess he
feels the rest are disposable.

In order to keep this honest, I should mention both of these kids (the
girl is 22 and is a military nurse, the boy is 24 and is a marine) are
both democrats, as are their parents.  So, they are naturally biased,
most likely.  The nurse does have a lot of shocking things to say
about the quality (or lack thereof) of the medical care that's
occurring both over there, and over here, though.  If you're badly
injured in combat, you get shipped back home, and setup in a low
quality, understaffed, underfunded VA hospital, and almost forgotten.

Then please explain why he acts the simpleton.  His performance during
the presidential debate were abysmal.  He couldn't lay out any plans
to fix the mess he's made in Iraq, and just parroted "we're making
progress" and "my opponent changes positions" over and over.

Does he act the simpleton on purpose?  To appeal to Joe Sixpack who
wants simple uncomplicated answers?  I'd really like to know.

I think Bush has made terrorism a bigger problem than it was before.
He's aggravated and alienated our allies, which is bad enough.  And
his bumbling approach to Iraq has aggravated arabs.  A lot of arabs
who wouldn't have considered becoming terrorists before, but now are
considering it.

I think for every terrorist Bush kills, two more replace him.  We need
a president with a better plan than "more of the same".  "More of the
same" isn't working, it's just getting more and more people killed,
while the violence keeps escalating.

                                                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Are you a racist?

I can't express how shocked I am that you've suggesting genocide as a
solution.  I don't think it's appropriate for me to respond to your
posts anymore.  Goodbye.
