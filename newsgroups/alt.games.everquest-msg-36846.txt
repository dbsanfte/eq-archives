Just a sideline... you say rare... try camping for the Degenerated Guk
Weed that drops from the Mutan Fungus in upper Guk... i have logged
numerous hours at a time... with not a drop.....  Still awaiting on
this elusive drop.
(this drop is for the Paw of Opolla quest, and the last item for me to
get)

Luck on those rare drops....  heheh 4 in three hours... is quite
common in comparison  grin...

Hunt well.
