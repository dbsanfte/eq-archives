It's not every person with a higher level character.  Usually it's someone
that has a high level character, but is still a reletive newbie in the game
that does stuff like this.  I've found that the true "old-timers" just don't
do this stuff, but some people get a few levels under their belt and
suddenly think they are experts in playing every class in the game.

How can you make it to 50+ and still be inexperienced?  It's easy.  There
are several progressively harder outdoor zones that are heavily populated
and it's easy to get into pickup groups.  A player can level all the way in
a half a dozen zones in pickup groups that basically use the same tactic
over and over again.  Because they are killing the same type of MOBs in the
same type of environment over and over again they believe that they know
exactly how every class should be played and because they make it to 50+
they suddenly think they are UBER and can tell everyone what to do.

Try to imagine the superiority the Sophmore feels over the Freshman in High
School and you get the picture.
