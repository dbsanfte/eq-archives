I don't buy that, sorry.

Id love to see some of your parsed melee fights, if you don't mind.

Btw, altho SoS is more haste, VoG has more +ATK, and the extra ATK far
outweighs the tiny bit of additional haste.

I only really see SoS used on wipeouts, and given to casters ( I assume
because it adds +AC, but never bothered to ask)

This really baffles me.

Was the ranger/rogue the same/similar level as you? I can see the point for
the rogue not tanking (unless he has chaotic backstab), but I can't see
anyway in a million years that gear for gear, level for level, you can tank
better than a ranger.. not specifically *You, Berg the cleric*, rather
clerics in general

A r/l friend of mine solod his cleric to level 57 about a year ago (before
the undead dots) so yes, its most certainly doable.

I managed to MoK the Thought Horror Overfiend on first cast last week.  The
Statue of Rallos Zek (the 1100 hitting mob in kael that starts the AoW
trigger) was totally resisting it though last night :(
