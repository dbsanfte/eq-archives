The original poster is correct, horses do NOT stack properly with innate AA
movement skills, items or spells although you can have both icons up.  So,
if you have the 8k bag of glue and runspeed 3 you are slower when on
horseback then when running normally.

I'm told however if you turn all Luclin models INCLUDING horses off you can
sometimes get the best of both worlds although it's probably a minor
exploit.  I know they tried to fix the "invisible horse syndrome" a few
patches ago - you'd get a red warning message saying you couldn't summon a
horse without the model on - but it seems to have vanished again.
