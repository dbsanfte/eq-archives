Don't forget "Use Tax".  In most states in the US, there is a "Use Tax" for
*using* items that were purchased out of state.  The use tax is the
difference between the state's sales tax and any sales tax paid in the state
of purchase.

In states with an income tax, there will usually be a place on the income
tax form for you to pay any other taxes you owe, such as the use tax.  In my
state (Washington), there is no income tax, and I'm not sure how I'm
supposed to pay the use tax...there may be a form I'm supposed to ask for.

Needless to say, almost everyone ignores use tax.  There is a guy on
comp.sys.mac.advocacy who claims that he DOES pay California's use tax on
all things he mail orders from out of state, and says the rest of us are
immoral for not doing so.  He's the only person I've ever heard of who
actually pays the thing, except on things like cars or boats, which most
states require you to register, and nail you for the use tax then.

At first, one might thing that a use tax is unconstitutional.  Indeed,
that's what my Constitutional Law professor thought, when he first moved to
Washington, straight from clerking for the Supreme Court, and was nailed for
the use tax when he registered his car. :-)  However, the Supreme Court has
ruled that it is OK, as long as the final total tax (use tax + sales tax in
the original state) is exactly equal to what the sales tax would have been
had the item been purchased locally.
