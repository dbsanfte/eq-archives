Oh, nice.  Of course, we're speaking of Christ here, not Elijah.
Or are you claiming that Old Testament prophecy concerning the
return of Elijah somehow overrides the words of Christ regarding
His purpose, as recorded in the New Testament?

You mistake me.  I hold conservatives, that is to say those whose
purpose is to keep hold of that which is good about things as they
are, in reasonably high regard.  OTOH, I am little impressed by
the "conservative movement" you refer to, which appears to me to
be a reactionary populist movement dressed up with a bit of
libertarianism when convenient, i.e. when the liberties of white
male heterosexual US citizens is topical.  Please note that I say
this as a white male heterosexual US Citizen, happily married,
never divorced (ask me what I think of Gingrich sometime, on second
thought don't, you wouldn't like it), worked for my living my entire
adult life, Army veteran, three children attending public schools,
active member of a protestant church, generally disgusted with
politics, used to hunt and fish when I had more leisure time...
you know, solidly within the target demographic of the "conservative
movement", and just as disgusted with them as I am with most every
other political "movement" I see active in this country.

So my contradictory response to your partisanship makes me a rabid
partisan?  And how conveniently you forget my characterization of
you as <not a typical Linbaugh fan> elsewhere in the thread, because
of the fact that you at least occassionally think outside the tiny
little box he has fashioned for his followers.  Of course, that is
far less useful to your attempt to position yourself as a "victim"
here (been taking lessons from the Democrats, have we?) than the
load of crap you're trying to pin on me here.

I'll leave that to the writer of the gospel.  I find his account, in
particular the placement of this saying in the context of a story
about wealth, far more convincing than the strained rationalizations
attempted by those who would claim this passage is not talking about
money when it talks about money.
