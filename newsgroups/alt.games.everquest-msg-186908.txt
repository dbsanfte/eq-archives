Well it looks to me like a cat's face I guess sorta representing Val Shir or
Beastlord's or what ever, but the guys face almost has a look of that being
a orc or something, the Paladin idea was probably the best guess as to what
his class is but as for race is anyone's guess, cool but I would have
prefered a dragon or statue of Tunare, but the one I got with me PoP exp. is
good enough.
