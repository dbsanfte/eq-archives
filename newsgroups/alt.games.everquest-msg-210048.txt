Dubious is a huge faction level, several hundred points long.  You probably
started at low dubious to the guards, and high dubious to the merchants.
Once you finally get out of dubious, the next two levels, apprehensive and
indifferent, are only 100 faction points long.   Very small, relatively.

So it's concievable that you're getting an equal number of faction points
for all three, but the guards started low enough in dubious that you're only
"high dubious" now.   It's also well within their capability to make a quest
give say 10 faction points per completion to merchants, but only one point
per completion to the guards.

As far as I know, theres no way to tell which is the case, unless you were
willing to go to "your faction is unable to get any worse" with all the
parties involved, and then run the quest for a couple months until one of
them gets out of KoS...   if the merchants become un-KoS first, then the
faction hits are different size.   If they don't, then not.
