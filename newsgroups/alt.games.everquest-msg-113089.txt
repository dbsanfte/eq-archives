I suspect that is some kind of bug, as there is no way I accidentally
time my dots so perfectly that they'll take root with them as often as
they do. Or, that epic wears off and takes root with it. Or, that
another dot wears off and takes root *and* epic with it (ouch). I've
started taking the precaution of always casting my spell dots before
my bracer dot, and I try to keep the bracer and epic dots refreshed
before they wear off.
