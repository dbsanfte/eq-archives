Preemptive strike to all flamers: I know, that laptops cannot offer an
EQ experience on par with a powerful gaming desktop, but they're
getting close.  :)

I intend to purchase a laptop as soon as I decide upon the best one
for me. My primary concern is that it be a major manufacturer (for
service and support reasons) and that it handle both software
development apps AND EverQuest very well.

Now my questions:
1.  Is anyone playing EQ on a laptop with a UXGA display? Does it
shrink the game screen if you play in 1024x768 mode?

2.  A laptop LCD has a lower refresh rate than most monitors. Is this
a noticeable factor?

3.  I'm assuming the new GeForce4 440 Go will handle EQ just fine. Is
that a safe assumption? Does the GeForce2 Go handle it without any
trouble as well?

4.  Would probably use an external mouse anyway, but anyone play using
touchpad or pointing stick?

Additionally, any experiences, words of advice or related information
regarding playing EQ well (preferably with all options turned on) on a
laptop would be appreciated.
