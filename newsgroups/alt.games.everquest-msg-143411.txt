And as a follow-up question, after you talk to Bondl Felligan in the NFP
sewers, the next step of the Shammy epic is right there in NFP as well.
Involves going up to a tavern and talking to the next spirt. I think
another TS faction hit is available there as well. Couldn't the friendly
chanter charm that one as well to get a hit off the next step? Or are
there other mobs in the area that would mess it up?
