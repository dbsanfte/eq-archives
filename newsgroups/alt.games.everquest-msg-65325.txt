The server status page at
http://eqlive.station.sony.com/
claims that half the servers are up as of 8:36 EST (which would I think
be 4:36 PST, or roughly half an hour before the predicted up time.)

Of course when we got numbers, we could see servers with only two people on
them and realize that they weren't really up, just populated with a couple
GMs running tests...

And of course it doesn't matter to me -when- they come back up since I'm
suffering a reprise of the "unable to download" blues
