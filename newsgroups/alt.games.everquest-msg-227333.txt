At least for me, it's not a matter of slowing faster with the shaman
casting malo(s), it just tends to be safer. If your timing is off and
you bounce a slow before the mage debuffs, you can get squished quite
quickly in a lot of zones and if you wait for the mage to call Mal-x
after it lands then you haven't saved any time over doing it yourself.
On tougher mobs, I will often see a mage overwrite malo(s) with the
lvl 63 debuff. Dunno how much easier that makes it to land their
spells but the two mages I often group with will go that route in
Tier3 PoP.  LDon (normal) nobody bothers to mal-x except maybe for the
assassination targets.
