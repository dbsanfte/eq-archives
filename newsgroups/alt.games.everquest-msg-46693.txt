I just did a fairly pointless and stupid trip: created a Erudite Necro, and
without killing anything or leveling at all, decided I wanted to make him
PvP+, just to see if I could.  The nearest PoD is in North Qeynos.  So I ran
him through Erudin, on the boat, through the sewers and up into NQ by the
monk's guild.  I managed to get to the PoD and hand in my book before a
guard wandered by.  Then, as my rite of passage, attacked the PoD and got a
quick trip home.  It was actually quite a bit of fun.

I decided the necro will be my designated solo character, since he can never
be buffed/healed/etc.  I'm also gonna try and get him as high as possible
without ever leaving Odus.  He's my "project" char.  I also love it when
people come up to me and say "PvP huh?  You're crazy."  Heheh.
