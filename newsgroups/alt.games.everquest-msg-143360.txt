Ok this much I know-- Higher dex for warriors dose mean more procs AND
higher number of cripples.  Question is: Is being able to cripple really
that important?  My strength seems to be enough that I do more damage than
someone else with same weapons. Whats the take on this? Should I atleast get
100 dex? Or, just screw the dex and leave at 73?
