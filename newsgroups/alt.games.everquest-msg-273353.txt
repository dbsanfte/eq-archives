Not to my or a lot of EQ player's minds that I know of - EQ2 like Rome Total
War needs a new breed of PC that the older games didnt need to run on - If
you have the system to support it all well and good, but not that many
people are willing to shell out on a new system just to play new games.

Remember the outrage when they upped the video requirements on EQ ?

To each his or her own - play for the enjoyment not just because it's new
and you'll find games like EQ have a viable life for quite a considerable
time to come - Have fun in EQ2, WoW, DAoC, SWG or whatever takes your fancy.
