Their test regime CAN'T include every single nonstandard system out
there. (Mine is far from standard or high-end, and it ran it just
fine, by the way) It's impossible. If you think you can do a better
job of testing, fine, take write them and tell them what they need to
do. You'll be the first person in the history of modern computer
gaming to find a way to test every single computer configuration in
use....

Again, so far John is the only person I've heard this problem with
since the patch, and I have followed several very high-traffic
fansites as well as this group. No amount of testing can catch every
single possible bug. This one in particular sounds highly irregular.
