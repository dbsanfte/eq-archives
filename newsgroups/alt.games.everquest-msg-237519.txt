You left out rogue for poisonmaking.  And contrary to popular belief, 
non-enchanters can learn jewelcraft just fine.  You only need an enc's 
help when you're restocking on enchanted metals, which you don't need to 
skill up.  Many encs will enchant metals for you fairly cheaply, now that 
they can do 5 in one cast. :)

It's a good thing, too.  You need moderately good JC for the shawl quests.
