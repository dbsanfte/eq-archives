    It's hard to imagine the sort of bug that would result in this, so I
believe it's intentional. As an aside, I can think of two other places where
you can also do this. The rogue trainer in the top room of the Inn in
Rivervale has a key phrase that lets you cap out Deeppockets faction (RV
rogues), and a rogue epic mob in Qeynos Sewers lets you cap out Circle of
Unseen Hands (Qeynos rogues) faction. All by just spamming a message.
