And how many MMORPGs have you programmed lately?  Do you have any idea the
number of lines of code these guys have to work with?  Do you have any idea
how delicately it must be balanced?  I'm not a stupid person, and I've made
mistakes just balancing my checkbook, fer chrissakes.  I don't agree with
everything Verant does but it's an easy admission for me to say I couldn't
do it half as well.  You're so perfect?  Either STFU or get off your crybaby
ass and show them how to do it better.
