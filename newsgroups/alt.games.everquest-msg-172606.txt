Neither of those is good because Drachnids wander near them.  I've seen
people killing Drachnids at the LOIO zone occasionally.  I've also seen
4 to 6 fully equipped corpses near the LOIO zone just about as often.
If you really want to hunt FV you'd do better to have two groups, one
of evils and one of goods/neuts hunting out in the middle of the zone
where you encounter Drachnids, Frogluks, Drolvargs, and Drixies.  The
evils kill all the Drixies (and any Pilgrims foolish enough to wander
by) and the rest of the mobs are FFA.  The Drixies were actually the
biggest pain in the ass for non-KOS hunters, they KS with the sort of
wild abandon you haven't seen since you last hunted in Misty Thicket.

But the poster who suggested FM or OT probably had the best suggestion.
In FM a pair of 32s can do very well, just be very cautious at first
until you get a feel for the roamers and the pathing, some spots in FM
are very deadly due to roamers, others are nicely manageable even solo.
