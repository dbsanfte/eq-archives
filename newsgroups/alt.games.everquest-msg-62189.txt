I don't think Lannella / Busker completely understood what you were 
talking about. The last item equipped thing has been that way since the 
beginning of EQ, but what you're describing is a new bug since the last 
patch. 

Since the last patch, I've watched people meleeing (visually, but not 
really) with bows, and slashing with no visible weapons. The last time I 
died, my weapon and shield weren't visible to me after I looted my corpse. 
I had to re-equip them to get them to show up.
