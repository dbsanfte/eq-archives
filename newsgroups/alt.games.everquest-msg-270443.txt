FFS- listen to yourselves - complaining that a *BETA* is not as stable
as a production environment.

Your feeble mitigation of "Yes, is was beta and all, but..." is just
that, "feeble". You mean on a beta - unavailable a "whole day"!! FFS -
you need a serious reality check. 

If you are going to hold such things against blizzard on a *BETA* for
crying out loud - you need a damn good slap. Read the agreement you
entered into on enrolling on the *BETA* and STFU. If you not happy to
accept such things you should stay away from Beta.

Just MNSHO
Cheers

P.S. I am not a WOW fan - never played it - so cant comment.  I cant
even be sure of the agreement I am lambasting you for agreeing to -
but even without reading, I bet it says to expect some instability.
