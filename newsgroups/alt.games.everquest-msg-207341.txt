I guess it all considers what you consider the 55+ game, but, I can 
remember a few times where the whole raid fought our way down to our 
corpses all dresssed in nifty red mage summoned armor along with a few 
odds and ends that people had sitting in the bank.  It's fun, it's 
challenging, and it gives you a real sense of accomplishment when you 
make it.

Personally, I enjoy the challenge, and it makes the raid more interesting 
when you know you have the chance of a serious setback.  I understand not 
everyone feels that way.
