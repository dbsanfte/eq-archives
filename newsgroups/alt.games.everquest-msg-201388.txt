B*I*N*G*O!  I dropped it after the 4th, I think.  I read book 1 and was 
WoWed.  I enjoyed his style, the characters, etc., but when he started 
going off on 4,803 tangents, my 4-celled brain imploded and I stopped 
reading them.  They call me "Short Term Memory Man" in my group of cohorts 
as a joke because I can't remember shit, and keeping track of what was 
going on in the series was too much for me.  If this series had come out in 
high school, I probably would have read them all.

Spit it out - what series?  I hardly ever read new books any more and just 
reread the ones that I remember to be good ( upside to having a horrible 
memory ).  I wouldn't mind getting into a new good series.

I've never been interested in history or the Egyptian empire before, but a 
friend recommended W[iy]lbur Smith's "River God", "Warlock", and "The 7th 
Scroll".  I loved the first 2 and just read them again.  The 3rd was 
borderline good, but had tie-ins to "River God" although it is set in 
modern times.  The tie-ins were the only thing that made it an ok read.  
These books aren't historical, per se, but have piqued my interest in this 
time period.
