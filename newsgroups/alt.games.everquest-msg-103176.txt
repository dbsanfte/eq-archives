When I created my gnome paladin (hehe), I took into account all the gear I
was going to hand down and adjusted my starting stats from that.  My main
goal of course was stamina at 100+ for those huge swords I will need to use
later, but I managed to balance almost everything with equipment...I have
never played a ranger, but I think if you go to Eq.castersrealm.com and
review their character creation guide for rangers, you will get some good
ideas.  Halfling rangers aren't there yet, but they talk about all the other
races and how stats affect them.....
