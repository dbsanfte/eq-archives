Yes!  I've greatly enjoyed every time I've been in a group with foreign 
language speakers.  It seems to almost guarantee learning something about 
a foreign culture... I find it fascianting.  It's also a good chance to 
practice, if it happens to be a foreign language you have even a tiny bit 
of comprehension of.  Somehow, the French were less disturbed by an Ogre 
butchering their beautiful language, since that was entirely in character.

}Don't fear what you don't understand, celebrate the difference, or as we

So you have both French- and Spanish-speaking players there now? :)
Vive la revolucion! :)
