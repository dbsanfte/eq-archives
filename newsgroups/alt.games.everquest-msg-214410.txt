PoP drops include some lore weapons that go dirt cheap. Since they are
lore, you can buy them cheap.  (e.g. Weighty Polearm,  2H Slash, Dmg
29, Dly 34. +15 AC, +15 Agi, +10 vsFire, +35 HP, +9.50 Wt was on sale
in the bazaar on my server for 25 platinum lat night and the Defenders
Lightblade, 1H Slash,  Dmg 22, Dly 34. +8 Dex +10 vsPos +10 vsDis +45
HP +1.80 Wt was on sale for 300 platinum.)   They have a recommended
level but not a required one.  Check your server's buysell channel for
deals.
