Thats a poor comparison really.  The chances of the melee not doing "max
damage every time" are much higher than that.   First of all, double
backstab does not happen on every round.   I don't have a good way to parse
out it's frequency, but I'd guess about 50% of the time you double backstab.
Secondly, right off the top you've got a 40% chance of each swing flat out
missing the mob.    Then, even with buffed attack in the mid 1400's,
(reasonable for the level of gear he is trying to compare to)...  I can
count the number of times my rogue has seen a double backstab land for 550 /
550 on the fingers of one hand.   You just don't hit full absolute max
damage usually.   Much, much more frequently than a "partial resist" for the
wizard.

Well, to be fair... I took this as him meaning backstab would recycle twice
during his spell refresh time, so he was counting 550/550 + 550/550 as his
"double 1100".  Still completely unrealistic for the reasons outlined
above...  but believable that he might think it.

At the level of gear he's trying to peg his wizard at "for comparison", I
dont' even think you'll be talking about 16 damage.  15 with a +6% backstab
would be more reasonable.
