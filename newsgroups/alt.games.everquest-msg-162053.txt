The Gorge of King Xrobb has some pathing problems, so you may have a hard 
time keeping all your kites close enough to deal damage.  Dunno, never 
played a bard.  There are 2 types of Minos in there, with the Chasm minos 
being a bit tougher, so watch out for them.  If you see the wandering Evil 
Eye, stay away.  If you see the wandering Evil Eye and he doesn't have a 
pet, check back with him in 2 minutes.  If he still doesn't have a pet, 
he's not really an Evil Eye but a fake one kind of like a Gas Spore in D&D.    
He will disease you if he can.

When my Necro was level 16 or 17, I went to Undead Island ( Garg Isle ) in 
the Ocean of Tears and killed gargs for a while.  There were several times 
that I saw a bard there kiting gargs around the island.  If you do this, I 
suggest a Lev song if you have one.

The gargs may start to give weak exp at level 22, though, so it may be a 1-
level answer, but at least you'd be seeing a new zone and get your swimming 
skill up.
