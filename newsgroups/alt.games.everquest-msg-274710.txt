In fact, I'd never give my money to buy a service that could be taken away
from me for breaking rules that are very loosely formulated, by anonymous
decision-making, with no right for defense or appeal, and without any
refund. If this is the contract the OP entered into, so much the worse for
him.

Aside from that, even if it's their game, it's not entirely true that their
rights trump mine, because I can always 1) go to Courts or 2) go to the
Court of Public Opinion.

In the present case, the 2d route has been taken, with ruinous results for
the OP, it seems... I accept it, but I must say that I'm quite surprised at
the way people that seem to be unable (or unwilling) to write a one-line
post without tossing in a couple of insults or profane words are so ready to
take offence for a rather harmless (IMHO) word written in another context
(to me it seems disagreeable and foolish, but not so bad at all)...

Well and good if so they wish, of course. (and, of course, my not being a
native English speaker, and not playing multiplayer games may somewhat
distort my perspective).
