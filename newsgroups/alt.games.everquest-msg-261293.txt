You know, I was going to.  But fuck it.  You're not worth the time.   You
want me to compete with the bazaar, with a theoretical unlimited budget.
It's not going to happen.   Even if sony wasted time on anohter LoY, it
would be the same level gear dropping there.  And people like you would
still turn your nose up at it, stating theres better available in the
bazaar.    And if they did make "better than bazaar" loot dropping in a 30+
expansion, you can bet I'd be humming the theme to green acres all the way
to those zones.   I'd park my ass there and do some no risk fights to get
myself some upgrades.

If you honestly want to know whats out there, look up Sol C, Sirens Grotto
and Chardok B, and look through the loot.    And no I don't know when you'll
be able to go get it.    Why don't you try and find out what happens, rather
than sitting in Kael moaning about what you don't have.

As for your ultra rares or unkillable...  Chardok B mobs are low 50's near
the entrance.    Any dog can pop a Rabid Chodakai as named, and the Rabid
Chodakai has among its loot table a very nice ring,  a FT 2 neck and several
other nice items.  I've seen the neck on sale in the bazaar for 75 - 100k.

By your standards, nothing they add would be "worthwhile content" either.
The drops you get will never compare with what is buyable in the bazaar that
dropped at a place 10 levels above what you're able to fight.    That will
not change.   The only thing they could add in a "mid-level" expansion would
be new zones to get the experience in, and there are already tons of those,
which nobody is using.     The new zones probably wouldn't see any use
either unless they threw paudal level exp modifiers in them.   Or made them
the "Hotzone" for a week or two.
