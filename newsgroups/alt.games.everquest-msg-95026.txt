On the contrary...

<copied from earlier post in thread>

Lum The Mad gave the following link...
http://www.edge-online.co.uk/news_main.asp?news_id=3596 as his source.

As you can see... no such quote exists on this webpage. The ACTUAL interview
published in the magazine (which I HAVE read... I live in UK) runs to 3
pages (inc pictures) and THAT doesn't contain any such quote, either!

<endquote>

One of us is mistaken.... one of us has incorrectly recalled an article in a
magazine that was published 6 months ago. We *both* read the article and now
have differing recollections about it. That is not uncommon and perfectly
natural... memories are not perfect.

HOWEVER... I have posted the above link to a reduced copy of the published
article.

My question to you, bizbee, is that if Flocks' quote DID exist... don't you
think it would be included in this webpage? Bear in mind this is a highly
contentious thing for a CEO of a games company to say, and any journalist
worth a damn would be SURE to appreciate the significance of such a quote.
You can bet it would be included in ANY precis of the full interview, no
matter HOW small.
