I think this is just a hubby and wife trait. Ive grouped with a few
married or as good as married couples and it almost seems to guarentee
one is only there because of the other, not coz they actually want to
play, so if it doesnt go in their favor without fail the game is crap
and so is everyone on it.

My hubby refuses to play he thinks EQ is full of weirdos and its
crap.. This is ok, more bandwidth for me.

However, I like you have met some married couples Id rather die than
even speak to. My view is the female of the pair is usually more
skitty and annoying, where as the male is more likely to vocalise any
issues.   Its a bit like the parent attitude of "My little Timmy
couldnt do anything wrong" .. they wont accept that sometimes life
sucks.

hehe, I remember days like that, I thought however from my guide
training you were allowed to port the body to the nearest dock as it
was often all but unfindable.

However, the attitudes of some people did make me laugh, the people
who'd threaten court action because I didnt feel they were right coz I
couldnt see any proof, or the ones who got their rez and then whined
and bitched because it took them so long to loot it, that they
attracted mob interest and of course we couldnt help.. Sadly, players
who havent seen the guide regulations seem to think guides can do a
lot of things, sadly as you obviously know its very limited, and most
of the time its smile, understand and pass it on.

Im glad I left guiding in the end, peoples attitudes were very non
motivating.
