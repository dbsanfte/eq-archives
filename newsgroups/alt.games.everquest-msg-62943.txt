I felt same way kind of on tribunal, because once the sleeper is
awaken no more gnome mask, velium primal does not drop as often etc.
However, for the widest number of classes such as our druids its
actually BETTER after he dies with a drop that everyone can use to get
other stuff:

Essence Lens

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Starts in: Sleeper's Tomb 
Who: Melalafen 
Rating: Excellent (5.00) 
Estimated Time:  
Minimum Level: 58 
Best Class: All 
Submitted by: Zhua Zhing 
After the Sleeper has been awakened, prismatic scales drop off
remaining mobs in Sleepers Tomb. You then give your prismatic scale
and ST key to a dragon named Melalafen by hailing him and asking what
prismatic scale. After giving the key and scale you get an Essence
Lens. You can then trade for something different that best supplies
your class, resulting in the various Essence Items, which you can
cycle over and over till you get what you like.
