I am reletively new (ok, totally new) to EQ, an dmust admit that I am 
hooked.  However, I have made what MAY seem a major error.  My lvl 16 rogue 
is pretty well maxed for now in Peircing, but totally lacks 1HS and 1HB.  I 
have started trying to raise 1HS to a respectible level, but can't seem to 
get the skill to move upwards.  

Now, here comes the question:  Is there a particular level of MOB that I 
need to be going for (dark blue, white, yellow, red) - with or without a 
group - to raise it?  Or does it go toward higher skill as I fight even a 
green?  I'd really like to get this up so that I can have a better 
selection for my off hand.

Any help would be great!!

Balanof, the rogue
