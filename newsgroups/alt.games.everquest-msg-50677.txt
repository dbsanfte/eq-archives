I think the very reason that merchants buy so low and sell so high is to
stimulate a player to player economy and exclude merchants as much as
possible.  Which would be a viable idea if there were more money sinks that
actually took the money off of the servers.   Every item that players sell
to merchants instead of other players brings even more money onto the
server, very little of which ever actually leaves.  Again this goes back to
item deterioration.  I believe the Trade Skill raw materials are priced
right to be a steady money sink, and they *would* actually take money off of
the servers except for the facts that a) a player only need buy one suit of
banded armor.... ever, because it never wears out and never leaves the
server, and b) players don't need to buy banded armor at all because it is
of much much lower quality than most things that are already floating around
on the mature servers, also that never leave, and being passed down from
character to character.  If merchants paid even a miniscule profit for trade
skill items, well, that wouldn't be a money sink either because that would
be still another source of money coming on to the server that never leaves.
DAoC, by the way has addressed all of these issues.

The only real money sinks in EQ now are food which is not even a drop in the
bucket, some magic items like those travelers boot things (also which don't
deteriorate so they only have to be bought once), potions like the water
breathing things that can be bought from merchants and sow potions that can
be bought from shaman (which is a good example of a good trade skill item.
One that is in demand, is used for a short time, then has to be replaced),
and possibly a few other small examples.

I think Verant might be trying to get some of the money off of the servers
with the horses being so expensive, but again, people will buy their horses,
they won't deteriorate and the money will just start piling back up on the
server again.  This is one of those temporary economy fixes that Verant is
famous for.

I have suggested gambling before with very bad odds, maybe averaging a 75 to
80 percent payout, which would be a good sink.  They've even got casinos in
place in Highpass Hold... just make them work.  But this probably won't ever
be done.

No, Verant are great game designers, but they are *not* economists and after
a few years, their extreme lack of foresight concerning the game's economy
is blaringly obvious.  Not to everyone of course.  The bulk of people who
play EQ like to kill monsters and get cool magic items and don't know and/or
care why there are vast discrepancies in the price of various items or why
many magic items are offered "for trade only" or why nobody is able to sell
patchwork, leather or banded armor, or why 10 plat used to be a great price
for a GG, but many people now often pay up to 200.  The people who enjoy
doing tradeskills and selling their wares play UO (or soon DAoC).

You are right that there are some things that Verant can do to "patch" the
economy or get money to flow temporarily, but I honestly don't think EQ will
ever have a real economy.

Best Regards
