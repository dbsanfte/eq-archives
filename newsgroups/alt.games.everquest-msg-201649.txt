Yep, heavy.  Good stats, though, and an excellent effect for a human monk.

30(ish) hitpoint difference.  AC difference is minimal.  8 dex is nothing. 
The 10 MR is actually nice.  The important part, though, is your level vs.
the recommended level on the dream haunt legs.  While they might be equal
(or in some opinions better) than the bloodclaw, are they at your level?

You might be surprised after some parses.  :)  No matter, your current
weapons are close enough that you could switch them either way and be within
a few DPS.

If you can handle the weight, tranquil staff is *the* monk weapon.  Yeah,
nicer weapons out now, but that stun's benefit to you solo or even grouping
is hard to put a value on.  I'm wielding a 41/31 and I *still* keep tranquil
staff in the bank for dueling.  :)

Screamstaff is great if you can't handle the weight, and if you don't wanna
pay the price for a flowing water.
