Well, I guess this is as good a time as any to put this.  I may not be over
there, but I have a very large stake in that area right now.  The U.S.S.
Harry S. Truman (yes, I know, the "S" shouldn't have a period, but that's
how she was named) is on her normal deployment.  I helped commission her.
There are watchstanders down in the Reactor Rooms that I helped train and
qualify.  An electrician aboard her is the husband of my roommate's sister
(who I've pretty much adopted as my own sister), who is also our guild
leader (Veshoon, for those on the Raith).  On the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt
are two members of my guild.  On the Abraham Lincoln, a ship that has set
new records for a CVN being on station, is my former roomate.  Besides all
these people are a few thousand sailors who I've worked with throughout my
time in the navy, and countless servicemen who I've never met, but have the
deepest respect for.  All of these people are not just "over there," they
could very well be in harm's way.  We don't know what Saddam has,
specifically, but we know we've given him some nasty stuff, along with what
the French and Germans gave him; it would be absurd to even imagine that he
doesn't still have stockpiles of the stuff.

It's neither my place, nor my desire to try to silence the opposition some
have to this war.  I realize that some people still aren't convinced, no
matter how clear I may think the issue is.  I can't convince you if you
don't already see, and it's quite doubtful that there's any evidence out
there that could un-convince me.  In the end, though, we're not the one's
putting our arses on the line.
