Still doesn't change the fact that Aego goes for 25p a pop, which is
what I donate for KEI with my wizard.

Do keep up, I know I mentioned earlier that this was an untwinked
monk. My main was 30th lvl at the time Kunark came out and I played
the monk to 40th lvl before ever going back to my shaman. In his 40s,
two fighting batons, azure sleeves and a froggie crown where his high
end  items and the only reason I got those was selling 2 forest loops
that I'd gotten in Warslik and FM. He got his first haste item, FBSS,
around 50th lvl. 

But I will grant you that an untwinked monk was easier to solo than a
warrior back then. Still doesn't negate the fact that he could always
get solo exp faster than my shaman, at least up through 51st lvl.

Hell, I can't even bear to solo my twinked warrior. Been there, done
that, got the t-shirt with the monk. Warrior soloing is mind-numbingly
boring imo.

Have you actually tried it lately? This isn't your kunark era EQ any
more. I did try it recently, new server no twinkage and I had 600p by
the time I left the newbie zone at 6th lvl, no farming involved.
Caveat that this was before the changes to lvl 1-10 so it took me a
twice as long to get to 6. I also started him as a barbarian cuz I
knew that I needed a newbie zone where I could make money. Got bored
with him at that point, it was just too easy and there was no
recapturing the newbie feel.

Embrace the suicide run to dead side. Nothing agros until you pass the
spider bridge, it's a fun rush and really no way you can die as a
warrior, even at 32nd lvl. Hell, even if you're that afraid, 12p for
an invis potion isn't exactly hard to get back when you have FS
dropping.

Jesus, if you manage to die fighting at a zone line as a warrior,
you're pathetic.

Yeah, but I'm not, and haven't been talking about the old days. Well,
except when talking about soloing my monk, but that was only as a
point of reference. Do you honestly think an untwinked warrior now
would have a more difficult time soloing than my monk did back then? 

I'm done with this discussion, we're down to rehashing stuff that's
already been covered and ignored.
