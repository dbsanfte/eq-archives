I'm not sure if this is the case, but it sounds like your running out
of range. Once you get far enough most mobs will start to regen like
crazy (Once you loose proximity agro). I've never had this happen to me
when I kill stalkers, but then again I usually run around them in
circles dotting them until they die.

Seperate issue but I'm also noticed stalkers 'popping' and appearing in
treant valley 10 minutes later, then running back with a train =p.
