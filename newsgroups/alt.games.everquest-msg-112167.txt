  Thanks, but I can't take all the credit. You should really check out 
Jim Infantino and his Big Ego: 

http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/11/jims_big_ego.html
http://www.bigego.com

One of those "really great, but there's no chance in hell of them ever 
touring out my way" bands that I seem doomed to like.

sorry, I didn't mean to offend you. Really, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to offend you. Should I like, change my 
attitude? Should I change my whole way of  being? Huh? 
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. BITE ME HARD!"
