The best part is that hoaxes are human spread virii. Fortunately Annie 
was able to avoid the payload (deleting her jdbgmgr.exe), but 
facilitated the spread of the 'virus' to usenet (again) by posting it.

I think in someways hoaxes have superior viral qualities to actual 
virii, relying on human ingenuity to spread them is far far more 
effective than anything that could be done in software :)
