    I know what he wants....

    No, he isn't a newbie. This is a fairly high-end quest. I would have
said "and he'd be mad to quest it at level 6", too, but now that I think
about it that would be exactly the time to do it. Can't lose stuff on death,
after all!

    He wants a medium fine steel BP. The "unstained" means he doesn't want
it to be dyed, as that messes up the quest. (As does using a non-medium BP,
apparently.) And the quest is with the Othmir in Cobalt Scar to get the
Emerald Scale BP, which requires turning in an Ulthork tusk, an Emerald
scale off Wuoshi, and that smithed BP. Was the twink a cleric? Mostly
clerics wear the AC 22 WIS 20 CHA 10 Sv. Disease and Magic 10 BP. :-)
