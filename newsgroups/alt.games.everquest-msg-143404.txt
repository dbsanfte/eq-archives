Thanks a bunch. It appears I will have to give that a try. Last night,
we went to BB and I killed pegleg and got the lesser spirit to spawn.
(He was a ghost dog.) I conned him and he was apprehensive. When I
hailed him to try to start the quest on my own, I got the usual "Oh, a
talking lump of refuse. How unusual." crap.

Now, the next question. Are these spririts technically Undead or are
they living? They look like ghosts. The reason I ask is, my wife's necro
is usually with me. Could she charm the spirit for me with her charm
undead line of spells? Or will it have to be a chanter?
