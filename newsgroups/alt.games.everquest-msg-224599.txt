I farm spider silk in EK on Stormhammer. This would work to a lesser degree
on other servers but is great money on Stormhammer because I can clear as
much as I can collect at 20PP per silk (not a typo: twenty plat each). I use
either the 41 Bard or 55 Necro  whichever is closest to EK, and run around
and kill every Crag and Carrion spider in the zone till I have to run around
too much to find them. They get a bit sparse - I think it is because every
time you kill a spider a random animal type mobs spawns - eventually if you
keep killing spiders and ignoring other mobs you run out of spiders, but by
this time you should have 100 silks or close to it. I then go do something
for a few hours whilst the spawns get back to normal and then come back for
another session before logging.

So I aim to get 200 silks per night, and proberly spend about 90 minutes
doing it. The other couple of hours spent playing at night are just normal
leveling on one of my alts - or Ancient Cyclops camping or something. I just
got another ring of the Ancients for my level 10 wizzie, though I am going
to have to get him up a few levels to be able kill Hasten Bootstrutters
placeholders to collect on it.

If I were just farming, I am sure I could make more, but it tends just to be
2  mini farms every day - beginning and end of my play session. On a
different server with more realistic Spider Silk prices this may not be so
viable.
