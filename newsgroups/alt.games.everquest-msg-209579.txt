Charmed Mammoths in Everfrost would be excellent for wreaking major havoc
on the mobs. Bit of a ways to a zone line, but there are a few helpful
guards wandering about....

Griff*ns in NK or EK might be fun for beating up stuff too. They hit *way*
hard for their level. Guards and zone lines aren't too far away either.

You could also try Marus Seru, but I don't know if Rockhoppers count as
animals.

But if you're new to charming, I'd second the idea of charming (and fighting)
easy mobs til you get the hang of it. You'll want to get used to all the
target switching (pets to mobs and vice versa), the feel of having ex-pets
chase you down, tashing and snaring before charming, etc., before trying
out your tactics on tougher white/yellow/red mobs.
