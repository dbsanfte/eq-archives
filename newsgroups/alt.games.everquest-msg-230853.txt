If I had to pick just one, it would be Katta Castellum (sp?). Its such
an eerie yet beautiful city. Theres something to marvel at with each
turn. Its very dark and gothic looking.

The glowing river in Great Divide at night is a sight to see as well
(ok ok - thats 2)...

I just love the look and feel of Crystal Caverns... (3 and counting)

I was awstruck when I first went through Dalnir...

Dang, the more I think about this topic, the more I come up with. I
better stop now and get back to work...

Oh and then theres the captains cabin in Hates Fury (that and being on
deck and seeing the ocean swell)...

(reluctantly pressing post)
