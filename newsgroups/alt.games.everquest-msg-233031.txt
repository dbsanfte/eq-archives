Had some help from a freind whilst playing then he asked me to link
weapon so he could so how well it worked. Could not work out how to do
this...
Opened inventory window right clicked weapon - weapon stats box
appeared  ...  moved cursor over weapons stats box and then left
clicked on the icon of the weapon.  He said that did not work, so he
then said just quickly right click on weapon in inventory window -
this also failed is there any instruction on this..Thank you.
