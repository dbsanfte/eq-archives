Oh, I'm guessing you probably picked it then because it was near the
top of the server list.  The server list is arranged according to the
number of players that are currently playing on it; the servers with
the fewest players are on top and the ones with the most players are
on the bottom.  So I can definitely see why you would have picked it
then since it would be near the top.  The PvP/Zek servers almost
always have fewer players than the other servers (except for the
Stormhammer server, the "premium" server which costs $40 a month to
play on).
