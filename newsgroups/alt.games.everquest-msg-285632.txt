I've been playing around with a parser recently, trying to figure out 
what my DPS contribution is.

Soloing low LB mobs, I'm clocking in at around 140 DPS, 40 of which 
comes from my pet.  Thats self buffed, including clickies, but no 
potions.  I think my actual DPS is higher, since I self buff to 21 DS 
but the parser (yalp) doesn't seem to include DS damage.  My high end on 
this run clocked in at 197 DPS, still not using HT

I don't really know where this puts me compared to other level 65's in 
my guild, as log parsers apparantly don't do a sterling job of tracking 
other's hits, and I also rarely go flat out like this while in a group; 
its my job, in theory, to stay alive, keep the mob on me, and conserve 
mana for disasters; that 140 DPS figure assumes I spend pretty heavy 
stacking DOTs and lifetapping; I kill a few mobs in a row and then sit; 
in a group I don't want to sit at all, plus I have aggro spells loaded 
instead of DOTs.

However, doing a Normal LDoN run with an average level of 64 or so (so 
most mobs were LB to me) I'm looking at a named kill (something I went 
flat out on) and see results as follows:

65 SK      147
65 Warrior 64
55 SK      36
62 Wizard  87
64 Druid   22

Now I wasn't MT on this, and had druid buffs on plus was under the 
influence of a haste potion.  And the druid DPS was low as she was healer.

Looking at other fights with the same party, the results tend to be 
consistent with that one, although generally lower; while the wizards 
DPS is right up there with mine, he only engages about half way thru the 
fight, so his total damage is around half mine, and his DPS adjusted for 
the total run of the fight is around half mine.  The warrior's DPS is 
consistently around half mine (partially because he's in front of mob 
and thus suffering parry/dodge/riposte and stuns), the 55 SK's is 
marginal, and the druid isn't doing noticable damage at all, busy healing.

I'll have to look at this more, I have a pretty small sample to draw on 
at the moment, but I'm beginning to suspect I'm actually contributing 
noticable DPS after all.

Berg, 65 SK, Combine
