Of course the best approach in that scenario is to only pull one at a
time. However, I personally don't feel the "smack 'em all" approach is
a very good idea in *any* situation. In the absence of a chanter, any
adds should be rooted. When you extend the length of time that *all*
mobs are beating on you bad things will happen. The cleric will not be
able to keep up with the much increased need for heals without drawing
aggro.

Always gang tackle one at a time and mez/charm/root the rest.
