I was having trouble with my screen freezing every 30 seconds or so for 
about 2 seconds, when playing with Norton running.  I turned it off and 
it certainly did improve the problem (still get em occasionally but not 
NEARLY as much) but of course I was paranoid about playing then.  Tonight 
a friend told me to download ZoneAlarm and use that when I'm playing.  I 
was just wondering if anybody else has tried this, and if it works?  I've 
always noticed that ZA gives pop-up windows every so often.  Now I'm 
paranoid about playing for *different* reasons. :)
