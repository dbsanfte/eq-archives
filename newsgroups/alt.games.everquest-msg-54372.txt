I believe he is more concerned with the AC to +mana stats.
If you start off with the item that gives you the most mana and a full mana
bar then as your mana is used up and switch to the item that gives better AC
as the melee starts then you have the best of both worlds. Your mana bar
would appear to jump up at that point but we all know it does not go up just
your pool total goes down. Slip the mana item back on when you med up again.
