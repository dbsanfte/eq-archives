    If it isn't the same as the small screen in every detail, it'll feel
wrong. That must sound bizarre to you, but trust me - when you read on
you'll understand.

    I really don't want to personalize any part of the screen. I have one
set of settings for raid, one for non-raid. Don't really need anything else
changed.

    My grandfather drove a Caddy, from what I've heard. ;-) I, on the other
hand, am very set in my ways. I've had the same pair of glasses since I
first got glasses 15 years ago. I've gone to the same Subway and ordered the
same thing for lunch every work day for two years, except when what I
ordered was changed by Subway (they stopped buying from Snapple, for
example). The Subway I go to is a ten to fifteen minute drive from work, as
opposed to the Subway that was built a block away roughly one year ago. I
still record music on tapes, rather than burning CDs. I like not having to
think about the little things, giving me more time to think about more
important things.

    Yes, I'm odd that way. But now at least you can understand how I could
do 15 levels in the High Pass/Keep area, 12 levels in Sol B, five levels in
Lower Guk and five levels in Sebilis - I find something that works for me,
and cheerfully do it repeatedly regardless of the tiny efficiencies that
could be gained through constant change. In that sense I'm well-suited for
doing XP in EQ!
