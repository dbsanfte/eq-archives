I have to agree my Monk is very dear to me I have 2 60 and 5 post 50
characters. This AC nerf is not a good thing Monks need AC to be able to
pull and separate mobs where groups can't or won't go. We take a serious
beating separating and delivering mobs to the group not to mention dragging
corpses. I don't believe Monks should be Tanks which some Iksar Monk have
become. Best way I can think of off the top of my head is reducing our agro
factor, Monks can reduce or even clear agro in battle just about any time we
want with FD so what would it hurt. Who would have a Monk as a tank if the
first heal or buff of any type cast on him would agro the Caster and the
Monk is unable to reclaim agro. The only classes that should be able to
reclaim and hold agro are Taunting classes.
