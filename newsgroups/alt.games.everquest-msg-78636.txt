They're not all that bad. Last weekend we started in AM and cleared all
the way up to Lord and held it for five hours with a four person group.
Warrior, Rogue, Cleric, Druid. All lvl 53 or below. Admittedly, the
Ghoul Lord is a bit of a long fight with that four person combo, and you
can get some adds from repops at the end, but it's doable.
