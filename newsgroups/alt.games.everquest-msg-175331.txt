Yeah there are, and some rude ones too.  It's not well explained on the
website what is meant by the scheduling of the download.  And since this is
the first ever downloadable expansion how is anyone to know that ONLY the
information is available NOT the actual feature?

Also, it seems that the information is being downloaded in pieces, so it is
a reasonable question to ask if each piece is available as it is downloaded,
or only after the full expansion is made available.
