Actually, there is much debate over certain skills being overpowered
in PW's.

Particularly the Use Magic Device skill.  BioWare did some odd things
with it adapting from 3e rules.  As a result, only modest levels of the
skill, plus a decent charisma guarantees the success of very powerful
spell scrolls/charged items and the ability to wear just about any
type of gear.

As a result, many people make pure melee classes, and add one level
of rogue (with their LARGE skill point allocation per level, and 
UMD as a class skill).  And they end up with a true tank mage.
