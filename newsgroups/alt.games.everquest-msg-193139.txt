Yep.  Mine typically says something like, "looking for a PoP Tier One
grind".

/shrug.  I still get the tells.  Interestingly enough (and related),
I've noticed that when I'm LFG I'm often the only cleric on the list.

My pickup group luck ain't all that great though, and I only LFG when
I'm on at odd times and my usual guild cronies aren't on.
