Actually, I don't.  I much prefer to kill stuff.  I should have used "kill" 
instead of "hunt" in paragraph 3 ( 2, I snipped #1 ) of my post so it 
wasn't confusing.  Sorry.  From what I have seen, different raids require 
minimums in different resists.  I don't know for sure, but I would guess 
that it would be very hard for me to meet minimums of 70 or 100 with just 
stuff our group can collect from killing, so I've resigned myself to having 
to possibly purchase some items.

This is the dream drop for me at the moment.  It is probably #1 on our list 
of items we want to kill for, if we can get the camp.

Never knew that.  Nice.

Ah, good.  I think I've used these for Crafted armor or something.  I guess 
we need to get a couple more.

I need to -clean- my bank.  None of my toons have any room, except my 12 
cleric.  Zym has about 3 10-slotters full of silk swatches for doing Wu's 
when I get my tailoring there ( currently 89, I think ).  Drag is holding 
crap that we have looted and need to get rid of from Dalnirs, Kaesora, and 
CoM.  I need to move a bunch MORE crap to my mule.

Nice, Dan!  I found a web page that has a nice list, even if it is over a 
year old.
