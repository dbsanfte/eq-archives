You blew it man!  You could have put 1000 words in front and 1000 words
behind that "tip" and in a couple weeks been sitting on your new yatch
surrounded by a dozen beautiful young woman!  As an extra bonus your "book"
could have included this tip free...  don't buy mounts either.  Dang you'd
have been rich man!  If I hadn't started twinks and bought main and first
+50 alt a mount I'd have around 100K in plat right now instead of less than
2K!!!
