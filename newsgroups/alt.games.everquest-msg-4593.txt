I'm not going to apologize on this one. I've apologized before.
This is getting really old for starters. I'm not going to "eat" whatever
Gamespot spews up from an "interview" from Butler. All I have
been saying is perhaps they put forth that "information" (Which, if
you have read some of the posts I had made) seemed really familiar
to some of the rantings from the kids on the web boards. I will
repeat this yet again because it is clear you have misunderstood.
People have been ranting about "Kerrans" being the new race for
months BEFORE the press release. Same as a "Beastmaster" class.
It's not anything new! When I see an "official" press release from
VI/Sony on their website stating that this in fact IS the new race/class
I will make formal apology to the newsgroup. Mainly just to stop
all you people's whining about my accusations.

I really don't recall you ever posting anything of worth here? Am I
mistaken?
Or are you just a lurker whom I've encouraged to come out of the cave?
