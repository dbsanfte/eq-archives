Almost nothing was spent to twink this character. Old gear from a number of
character that either I or my wife had outgrown was used for Tabifa. Just
recently ( like within the last 3 days )  I splurged and bought her SCHW, a
Stave of Shielding, and an Acrylia Studded Tunic. Bofore that her best items
were a pair of PSU's and Ice weave leggings. What makes it SO easy for a
beastlord to rush through the early levels ( Tabifa is only level 29 after
all  ) is the pet. The pet hits hard and procs at an insane rate.  In any
given fight I only administer about 1/4 - 1/3 of the total damage to the
mob, and thats lead to the moderately poor weapon skills.

Im happy to report however that the skills are improving :) /duelling and
sic'ing BooBoo on Tabifa has lead to some decent progress in piercing, and I
plan on repeating the process for 1hb, and to get those last few points of
HTH that I want. Sadly BooBoo is only DB to Tabifa, so the skill ups arent
coming as quickly as I would like them, but I can live with that : )
