Someone mentioned earlier.
/loadskin skinname 1
will load the new skin but keep the windows setting how you had them.
dont know if you have a second computer, but when changing characters,
you could copy the UI.ini file of  the char you like to the char you
are about to play.  And if you only have one comp.. you can log all
the way out and do the same there then log back in...
Alot less down time in settingyour window locations, and your alpha
and background etc.....

Yeah, I wish FD would change perspective.... not so im looking at the
world sideways... but at least lower my camera angle.

I agree... Im a keyboard and mouse junkie... but I like to use my esc
key much more than moving my mouse around a screen to exit a window

well in hits mode you could take out certain info...
a nasty beastie hits you for 50
could be
hits you for 50
or could be just
50

I personaly had the creatures name listed so I could see if was being
hit by an add from behind....
but on my hits... I just had the type of hit and damage shown...

punched for 50
kicked for 5
crushed for 129
striked for 15

like to know what type of damage Im doing...

One issue I have with the filters....  I can put all combat in one
window, but I wanted to put all the other misc info in thesame
window...  i.e.  you are faceing north,  fallen for 20 pts of damage,
etc...
but using the misc option.... also puts all NPC text in that window...
Now comon..... If I want all says in a one box.. why the hell would I
want NPC says in adifferent one?
