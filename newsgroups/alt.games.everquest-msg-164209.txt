Somehow, I don't think Dennis gives a rip what any caster might
think of this.

It was pretty clear to me that Dennis was speaking of some as yet
non-existant game(s).

<snip the rest of the attempt to equate mana with HP>

Sorry, it's a pretty flimsy analogy.  First, casters also have HP
as a measure of combat endurance.  Second, and far more important,
melees have no way to "spend" most of their health rapidly in order
to defeat enemies.

As to your comments about "balance".  There is an enormous imbalance
between melees and casters.  Any caster can outsolo any melee by a
very large margin, and with ease.  In general, caster heavy groups
way outperform melee heavy groups for xp grinding (I'm excluding
the tiny segment of the population generally referred to as "uber"
who have melees geared to perform way beyond us ordinary immortals).

In short, <all> casters are powerful, while very few melees are.
The power of casters is intrinsic, it has to do with being able to
achieve extreme burst performance.  "uber" casters can do this more
often (Flowing Thought items), and to a slightly greater degree (but
even ordinary casters can manage a pretty deep mana pool).  The
power of melees is totally gear dependent.  If you're a melee and
you aren't "uber" you aren't balanced, that's the stupidity of the
EQ class balance paradigm:  0.01% of the melees are balanced vs.
100% of the casters.  And that's probably what Dennis was getting
at:  if "magic" is of little direct use in combat then caster would
require melees to do the dirty work in the overwhelming majority
of encounters, whereas in EQ the reverse is true.
