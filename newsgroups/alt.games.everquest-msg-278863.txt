Exactly what we need,more zones.
Try to find a group for Ldon,GoD,Droga,Chardok B,etc,entire expansions
totally void of players now,although there is still valuable loot and
nice xp to get .
I really dont need it,I would be glad to find a group for Tipt to get
KodTaz access for example,its impossible nowadays,and now they are
going to spread out the players more?

Tell me why I should i buy another expansion ?
