Well, lets see... Morrowind and Dungeon Siege had the most played
since EQ...  a total of about 15 hours each..... haven't touched em
again...   Warcraft III, eh... 2.5 hours... cute...neat.. hadn't
grabbed me...   Now Never Winter Nights... haven't even installed it
yet...

YES I am a game Junky..... I just like to see what's new in the game
industry...

EQ has my heart... and my monk has taken over my play time...
