I can play with temp/virtue and without it... but what I can do changes, 
just as (as you note), what and how I do things with a cleric around 
changes.

Temp is a funny thing, though, unlike KEI and its cousins, it really 
doesn't help you out all that much on a per hour basis.  If your cleric 
is under 39, or if you have no cleric, it barely speeds up a group at 
all.  Increasing your HP means you can live longer... but all that HP 
has to be put back, which also takes longer.  The increase in AC should 
save you a bit of damage... but not a whole lot, certainly not by 34.

It doesn't help you kill faster at all.

For the most part, "uber buffs" were killed some time ago.  You can't 
get KEI or Focus or POT9 at a level when its really game altering 
anymore (note: all buffs that actually change your kills per hour rate), 
what these buffs do now is allow players to do without members of the 
casting classes in their groups and still get some of the benefit 
thereof.  Temp is one of the few counterexamples; a low level 
(relatively speaking) buff with a KEI style duration which will stick to 
very low level characters.

If your lack of Temp is upsetting to these people, I bet the fact that 
you are (probably) desperately undergeared (by their standards) is far 
more worrisome; if you aren't in stuff that drops off level 50+ mobs, 
then your lack of haste and high damage/delay weapon and low base AC all 
will have a much larger effect on their exp bars than will your 
relatively low hp and AC.

If someone wants you to be temped in order to group with you, then they 
should pony up for the cost of the buff.  I've insisted on that from 
time to time, sometimes people paid, sometimes they just put up with me 
without the buff, sometimes they've disbanded.  Their loss I figure, but 
then I can always solo, so such things aren't much of a concern.

I do know, though, that there are some times when I definately look for 
a temp/virtue for myself; when I'm expected to be MT doing something 
that I shouldn't be doing at my level, or with desperately inadequate 
healing.  Its not for the kills per hour, at that point, its for 
surviving during overpulls and mistakes; doubling my hp total means I 
have a lot more room for error.

And I frequently purchase one when I'm going to be soloing; with recent 
(ok, months old) changes to sitting regen rates, its much more effective 
for me to kill twice as many mobs in a row and then sit to regen twice 
as many lost hp; the longer I sit at one time, the faster my hp regens 
back up, doubling my hp total probably adds 25% or so to my kills per 
hour, in addition to protecting me from deaths due to overpulls for at 
least part of the time (early during each kill cycle, after I'm back at 
full hp, but more importantly when breaking a camp for the first time, 
so all the mobs are up, if I'm doing something of that nature)
