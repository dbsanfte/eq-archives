OK, I'am alittle late I suppose. I'd like to get started but where and
what's the best way to get started. I figured I buy the TRILOGY and SHADDOWS
OF LUCLIN,  and what about PLANES OF POWER. I really want to play EQ2
because the timing will be better. I played daggerfall in 1996 era. You
could buy homes and ride horses way before EQ. Should I buy 1 year
membership and play for a year and then move to EQ2. What webpages should I
read for people who are just getting aquainted in EQ and feel like the small
guy. Thanks  for anyone thats nice enough to help. Also is there a server I
should play on when new or does that get covered in the readme file when you
install. This all adds up $$$. I'll need a book collection too.
