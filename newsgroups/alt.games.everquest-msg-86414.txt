If you have Luclin and less than 512MB RAM, get more.  If you don't, make
sure you have at least 256, but still preferably 512.

If the answers you received are less than useful it'll be because the
information you gave us was less than complete.  Post your CPU speed, amount
of RAM, hard drive size, video card, operating system
