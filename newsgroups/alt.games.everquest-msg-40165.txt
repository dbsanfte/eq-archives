Hmmm... first thing is some +3 wis earrings... should cost you in the
neighborhood of 15 plat each.  Buy them off a player jeweler.

Second item... the Testament of Vanear.  +10 wis, +10 mana.  At level 17,
you'll need a small group to camp Dillan Starshine up in Highpass.  Once he
spawns, wait till he takes a walk and gets away from the bandits.  Then keep
him rooted and snared while you nuke him as quickly as possible so he
doesn't get to go for help.  And be prepared to take a MAJOR faction hit
with Corrupt Guards of Qeynos....you'll drop one full category each time you
kill him.

Third item, if you don't have it yet, is to get the Thunderstaff in Qeynos.
Gives +3 wis for those times when you're practicing 2hb and can't hold the
Testament of Vanear.  Before too many levels go by, you'll be able to do
part 2 of the quest and get the Bonethunder Staff...still +3 wis, but much
better weapon that procs a DD anti-undead spell.

At Allakhazam, check under the 'Library Book' for the Testament of Vanear
Quest (starts out in Erudin), and for the Thunderstaff, check out "Drosco
the Zombie" (starts out in South Qeynos at the Temple of Karana.)
