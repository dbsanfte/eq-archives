Does anyone know if the amount of memory on a video card above 64Mb makes
any difference to the game, e.g. number of models you can have loaded, lag
in heavy populated zones and on raids, etc. etc.

Specific example:
I have a GeForce 4 Ti4200 with 64Mb memory
If I changed it to a GeForce 4 Ti4200 with 128Mb memory, would there be a
difference as far as EQ is concerned?

Before people start telling me it would be a waste of money, ATIs are
better, etc. etc., I actually need to replace the graphics card in my 2nd
machine. I am sticking to nVidia because they work (for me) and I understand
them, and I want to keep the machines similar in spec.

Assume I buy the Ti4200 128Mb anyway, should I put it in the main machine
(which has the 64Mb card already), or just put it in the 2nd machine
(because there won't be a difference so why take apart 2 machines instead of
one).
