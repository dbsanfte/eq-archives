The video processor speed may have something to do with it, but the newer
cards also support a lot more special effects that were being rendered by
your CPU in your earlier card. You can verrify this with any DirectX
utility. My info comes from a Creative Labs driver developer -- most games
don't even use 32MB, take their word on it. EverQuest stores most of its
textures on your motherboard RAM, that's why there's such a high
requirement. It's much harder for the programmers to selectively store these
textures in video RAM, since you need to account for the systems with only
16MB -- that's why you set this in the game's setup, and not during
gameplay.
