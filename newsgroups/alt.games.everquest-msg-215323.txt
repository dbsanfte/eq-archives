Yesterday I got this email from a former guildee, saying that since I am
in his address book, I may have gotten infected.  The letter he sent
says in part


/quote

A virus has been passed on to me.
 My address book was infected. Since you are in my address book, you
will probably find it in your computer, too. The virus, called jdbg.exe,
is not detected by Norton or McAfee  Anti Virus system.

 The virus sits quietly for 14 days before damaging the system. It is
sent automatically by "messenger" and by address book, whether or not
you sent e-mail to your contacts.

  Here is how to check for the virus and get rid of it.  Please do this!

1. Go to start, then click your "find" or "search" option
2. In the folder option, type the name...jdbgmgr.exe
3. Be sure to search you C Drive and all the sub folders and any other
drives you may have.
4. Click "Find Now"
5. The virus has a teddy bear icon with the name jdbgmgr.exe

/unquote (sorry if I fubared the formatting)

   Well, I do have the files, but I am skeptical.  The letter is written
in a much more clean and lucid manner than this person usually pulls
off.  I am pretty certain that it is a cut and paste job he got from
somewhere else, rather than his own words.  And I have heard of a letter
of this type being sent out by well meaning souls, chain mails style,
that has one delete an actually perfectly innocent file, which then
messes up one's operation of one's machine.  Also, the description of
now this works sounds fishy to me.  Do virii sit idle for two weeks? 
And if I can find it so easily, why the heck can't Norton or McAfee?

   This person is someone I am on good terms with, but I know that his
computer knowledge is less than... um... well, he does now how to turn
on a computer... hmmm.. and I know that he knows out to set up a web
page, even adding some java.  Maybe he knows enough to know about this
sort of thing... maybe.  But I think what happened is that this letter
was sent to him, and he in return sent it to everyone in his address
book, probably without checking it out.

   I didn't delete the file.  Should I?
