Ok, first time playing EQ, so forgive me when I say, "WHAT THE CRAP!!
You lose your stuff when you die at level ten?!"  I just turned level
ten and was travelling through Greater Faydark look for Willow Wisps,
had NO IDEA where I was going, then when a Wilow Wisp killed me, an
now I don'y hve a clue where my body is located.  Any suggestionson
how I might be able to find it?

If you cant find a PC capable of finding it, you can get a chipped gem/skull
rod (sold outside bank in Kelethin), then get to as near to where you think
you died and use it (remember, in Gfay, there will be many noobie/lowbie
corpses, so get as close to where you think you died as you can).

This has worked for me, but not in gfay (I was noob when I tried, from
inside kelethin :PP ).

Good luck.
