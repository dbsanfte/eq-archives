Dying due to link death, I  hate that. I don't mind dying to
my own stupidity link over-pulls, taking on a high con, etc. but losing
exp through no fault of my own really pisses me off.

Idiots that sit at a zone exit and whine and bitch and act surprised
when a train comes through and kills them. If you don't want to get
hit by a train don't sit on the tracks moron. Amazing that high level people
still do this.

Also, shouting 'TRAIN! to ZONE!' is a coutesy not a rule.
