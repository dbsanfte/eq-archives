Psychic Friend*: "Can you port me?"
Me (not terribly busy): "Yes, I am capable of porting people."
Psychic Friend: "Great How much?"
Me: "Normally 15-25 plat, depending on location and how busy I am."
Psychic Friend: "Cool, where at?"
Me: "Where what at?"
Psychic Friend: "Where r u?"
Me: <where ever I was at the time>
Psychic Friend shows up a little while later, stands in front of me, jumps
up and down while I am moving to cast around him at whatever is coming down
the hill to eat me.  Finally:
Psychic Friend: "Hail, <me>"
Me: "Yes?"
Psychic Friend opens up a trade window with 15 plat in it.
Me: Cancel.
Psychic Friend: "What?  You gonna port me."
Me: "You mean am I? No."
Pychic Friend: "Y??????"
Me: "Because I don't know where you're going, and we haven't set a price,
and I didn't say I WOULD."
Psychic Friend: "You said 15 plat."
Me: "Are you hard of hearing?"
[shift]+[up arrow]
Me: "Normally 15-25 plat, depending on location and how busy I am."
Psychic Friend: "Are you busy?"
About now, I'm thinking of gating just to be rid of him.
Me: "Yes. Someone is looking for a port to an unknown destination, and won't
leave me alone."
Psychic Friend: "Can I get a port?"
Me: "From me?"
Psychic Friend: "Plz."
Me: "Fine... to be rid of you."
Psychic Friend invites me to group (normally I decline and then invite
them)... I accept.
Psychic Friend: "Ready."
Me: "That's nice.  But there's something crucial missing here."
Psychic Friend: "Oh yeah."
Trade window... 15 plat.
Me: "Um, you plan on telling me WHERE you want to go, or should I just pick
at random?"
Psychic Friend: "BB"
Me: "Closest I can get you is GFay."
Psychic Friend: "No, my friend is in BB.  I need to go to BB."
Me: "The closest I can port you is GFay.  You need a druid to get to BB, or
you can turn left when you appear and walk to the zone."
Psychic Friend: "my friend is in BB."
Me: "So find a druid to port you. Or walk from GFay."
Psychic Friend: <pause> "Okay I'll take Faydark.  How much?"
Me: "50 Plat."
Psychic Friend: "What?  You said 15!"
Me: "No, I didn't.  I said it depends, and you've taken up WAY too much of
my time."
Me: "My price is going to go up 5 plat for every line of chat I have to type
starting now.  If you don't like it, find someone who isn't busy, or take
the boat, it leaves from <over wherever the boat was leaving>"
Psychic Friend: "You're really high."
Me: "55: Take the boat.  I have better things to do."
Trade Window... 50 plat
Me: "Price now 60.  I said 55 last line."
Psychic Friend: "Will you take a trade?"
Before I can answer he ups the amount in the trade window to 60, and hits
trade... maybe he was learning.

Now for everyone who thinks I'm an asshole for that.  I was busy.  If the
conversation had been:
Psychic Friend: /ooc or /shout or /auction "Looking for port to BB."
Once I was done with a kite I would have /telled him "I can send you to GFay
for 20 plat." (or maybe 15, depending on just how quick the exp was coming.

If his first tell had been:
"Can you port me to BB, please?"
He might have gotten it for 20 (or 15).  And the conversation would have
been about 5 lines.

*Psychic Friend, isn't.
