Was in GD doing giants with necro in a full group with *3* clerics.  They
kept healing me when I was almost done casting tap (wasting my
mana...GRRR!!!), yet *STILL* managed to not lay a single heal on me as
Fergul Frostsky was beating on me for trying to darkness him.  Dead
gnecro...
How do you die with 3 clerics in the group you might ask?
Well here's where it gets wierder....
Of course one rezzed me for 50% while I was camping my spawn point in PoK
and all is 50% better.  Didn't bother looting my corpse right off and was
memming spells when I get another offer for a rez from one of the other
clerics (for 50%) and accept.  Rez effects started over and I had full 100%
exp regain.
When someone /ooc'd for a rez, we tried it again and it didn't work.  The
difference in scenario was he was already in zone for first rez and wasn't
in group.

Any one of you ever witnessed/heard of/or had this happen to yourself?

Sean...
