You'll never get hit by a train if you stay off the tracks. If you insist 
on hanging around the zone line, then you should probably just get used to 
it.

Some zones are more succeptible to trains than others, and PC is a pretty 
bad one. Though it's nice when someone shouts out a warning, I don't expect 
it to happen all the time. All I *do* expect is that the fleeing player 
take a route that avoids other players when possible. It's hard for them to 
avoid me, however, if I am hanging out around the zone line.
