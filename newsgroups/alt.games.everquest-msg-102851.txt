That sounds right.  Guess I've got lotr on the brain.  Nice money for a low
level mob.  I couldn't wear it because it was small.  It was AC8 and sv
magic +1.

I hit 10 tonight.  I rockith with an iceclaw!  When I first got it I took on
a blue mob.  Killed it!  Took on another blue mod.  Killed it.  Took on an
even con orc centaurian.  Slapped me in the face until I agreed to be it's
bitch.  Zoned when I could, screaming like a sissy girly man.  Took on an
even con giant spider.  Bad boys hit hard and that poison sucks!  I stick
with blues or groups until I get some real armor.  I've made everything I'm
wearing now.  Patchwork.
