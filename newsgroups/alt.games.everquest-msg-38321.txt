I logged off last night after dinging 48, and when I tried to get on this 
afternoon, my computer locked up right after the character select 
screen...after rebooting and finally getting started, I was suprised to 
see that I was in FV, naked and back at level 47.

I was hesitant to petition since I figured they would say I was hacked 
and ban me, so I ran back to the Dreadlands and looked all over for my 
corpse, but couldnt find it...luckily a necro was able to track it down 
and I got a rez from a friend, so I got most of my exp back. What's weird 
is that my corpse was in an area of the zone that I haven't been to for a 
few weeks...

Has this happened to anyone else?
