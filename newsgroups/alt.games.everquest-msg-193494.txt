There are a few rules that make our server different from the rest.  First
there is no common tongue.  You have to learn other languages to
communicate.  Second there are very few no-drop items.  Third, the tlc or
trivial loot code.  More or less if it conns green to you or anyone in your
group, you cannot get any magic, lore, or no-drop items(the few there are
usually for epics).  Other than that, it is just like other blue servers.
It is the best server I have ever played on.  There is no ooc channel at
all, and a good percent role play.  So please come join us.
