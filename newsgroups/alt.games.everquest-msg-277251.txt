Sometimes I get through, sometimes I can't connect.  I suspect
their new servers aren't quite up to the full load yet.  Also,
even when I can reach them, some areas still aren't up; e.g.,
the Atlas was still down last I checked.

Currently their front page is working, and includes this message:

    We're back! Sort of. We're sorry for the downtime. Our static
    server died on us. Since we had started the process of moving
    the files over and configuring a much faster static server, we
    decided to just scrap the old one and move everything over as
    fast as we could. Right now not everything is working, but the
    main parts should be. Quests and items are up, and the rest
    are being worked on as I type. Expect a lot of images to be
    missing as well. Hopefully by next week everything will be
    back to normal. Thank you for your patience.

	-- Don.
