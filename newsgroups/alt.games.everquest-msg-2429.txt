I'm assuming this was directed to me. It appeared under my post, but I
can't 100% assume that you are talking to me as you lacked the
gumption to quote the post you are replying to. Believe it or not,
newsfeed can be erratic, meaning that the posts you see are not
necessarily the entire set of posts that I see, and vice versa. Still,
as a veteran of usenet you will doubtless realise this.

>The flaw in your philosophy is that you think you and some others are
>needed here. 

The flaw in your statement is that you didn't think before you posted
it. If you will claim that you did think, then you are strengthening
my belief that thinking isn't your forte.

As it happens (if you'd bothered to ask me, rather than place your own
presumptions upon my shoulders) I don't believe that any single person
is *needed* here. 

>You believe the ng can't survive without you. 

I believe no such thing. I believe you don't know what I believe.

>You believe there is a preferred or right way to post, 

Yay! You got something right! Well done, lad! <pats "Da Avenger" on Da
Head>
There is *always* a *preferred* way to post. Not everyone is in total
agreement of what this preferred way is; but like it or not, the vast
majority of long-term subscribers to usenet understand and use the
"preferred" way. That doesn't make it the only way, or even the
correct way.... but it most certainly is the preferred way.

>you believe there is a status quo. 

Of course there is a status quo. Look the expression up in a
dictionary and tell me I am wrong.

>Unfortunately for you you're are wrong.

"You you're"? You're getting all excited and typing ahead of yourself
aren't you, hon?

>The ng I came from is much older this this one. 

And the relevance of this would be what, exactly? I've regularly
read/posted to newsgroups much much older than "this this" one *or*
the one you "came from".

>We don't quote unnecessarily like you do here. 

Neccessity is subjective. It is usually necessary to at least quote
the parts of a post you are replying to, so that the person you are
replying to, along with everyone else, can comprehend what you are
talking about. An achievement in and of itself when looking at the
actual "content" of your recent posts here.

>If fact "we" think it's very silly to quote without reason. 

Well "I" think it is silly to presume to be spokesperson for an entire
newsgroup.

>A waste of electrons. 

How can electrons be wasted? They aren't a finite-resource.

>It is you that needs to mature in internet protocols. 

You? Is that "me" or "we"? Forget I asked... something tells me that
the answer will not interest me.

>You are babies when it comes to flame wars, if that's what you're 
>looking for. Move or be crushed dweeblings.

I wasn't aware you were attempting a flame war. I've yet to see you
inflict so much as a grazed knee on anyone here. You are not worthy of
my ire. Go away, child. Come back when you've grown some chest hairs.
