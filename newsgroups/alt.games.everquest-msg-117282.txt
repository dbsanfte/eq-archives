Hello all,

Seemed like time to stop mostly lurking and post an
idea I had last night concerning improving tradeskills.

I wonder if Verant can patch the tradeskills code
(Smithing especially) so that when you make an item like
a weapon or armor, the player's name is attached to it like
the other stats.
ex/ crafted longsword, 7 dmg, 36 delay, weight 5.0, crafted
by Master Smith "Phred"

The code could pull the skill level text (average, below average, master,
etc)
and the character's name to append to the item description that comes
up when you right click it.
This would only apply to player made items, and maybe be coded so it
only applies once the character reaches master skill level.

I would think it silly to see a toolbox made by Feeble smith, Phred or
Very bad smith Phred?

Comments?
I think it would be fun to "collect and trade" for the fabled banded armor
pieces crafted by master smith Phred.   collect the whole set!

:-)
