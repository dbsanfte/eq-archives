Dex does have an impact on warrior crit frequency. How large an impact
that is, I don't know, but this is word from a 55 warrior guildie (
One running around with at least 10 characters, 4 that are 50+, one of
which is 60, and has been playing since beta... ). I haven't seen
studies to prove it or anything, but this person is pretty much
aknowledged as knowing the game inside and out. ><
