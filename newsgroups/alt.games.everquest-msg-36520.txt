One time in newbie hell is really enough isn't it?

A real crowd pleaser patch vs the normal vision would be something like you
new characters start off at 1/2 your best character up to level 9. That is,
have a level 10 necro, you get a level 5 druid or magician. If you have a
level 18-40 character, you get level 9 for the starting point of any
character you want to create.

I really mean, after running every character I have on my main server to
double digits w/o twinking, I question the value of the experience.
