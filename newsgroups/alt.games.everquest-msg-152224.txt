I think you need to look under Options, or something like that, when the
patcher starts up. I seem to remember it having checkmarks to download the
expansion patches......

Only other thing I can think of to do is to delete the Trilogy from your
hard drive, re-install it, and let it download all the patches from the
installer.

I hope you have a fast connection, because if you're running a 56k
connection, you're looking at a 3-hour or so download time, iirc.
