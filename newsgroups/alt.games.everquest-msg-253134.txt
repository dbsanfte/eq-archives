Breeze is 2, c1 is 7 at that point. I think c2 is about 8-10 at 42 point?
tops out at 12. KEI is 14+ lots of candy, and duration.

I could look that up on Lucy, but not that concerned.

The point is they allow people to get higher level buffs cast on them by
their sugar daddy's sometimes.

And c2 is limited still? I thought spells below 46 could be tossed on
anyone... last time I used SLTW (46 haste) was on a level 20, during the
free month 'come back, come back to us'...

The good news I guess is that once you hit 40, 50 should be a week pr two
away. I never had c2 when I was in my 40s (c2 was like a 52nd level spell).
They actually moved the spells down in level a while (year? year and a
half?) ago.

As far as why? Well... In a desert you are not picky about the water you
drink. If they won't take you because you can't cast C2 and can't get
another enchanter, well they didn't deserve you anyway.

Also, as an enchanter it's usually good to be on the high edge of the level
spread... that way you are mezzing, slowing, and charming whites and yellows
and not reds. A well played enchanter is not a buff bot, and brings far more
to the table than just the clarity line.

Tyas: Puller, Nuker, Debuffer, Pet Class and Mr. Crowd Control. I line em
up, the knock em down.
