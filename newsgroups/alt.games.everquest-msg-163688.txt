Shoulders could do with more AC, ideally Wretched Pauldrons but out of your
reach in Umbral and prolly a bit too pricey. Look for some of the Racial
Armours you can wear in the Bazaar.
Back, the same, look at the prices on the Racial Armours, alt a spider fur
cloak will give you more AC and you'll have cash to spend after selling
Direwolf one.
Chest, not a weak spot as such but Barbed Ring mail has fallen in price now
and Acrylia BP's can be bought for about 2k, both 30AC.
Feet, Anything with more AC, DW will give you the most AC for cash here.
Legs, Sebilite scale legs, should be around 1500 at most, 16ac with Wis...If
not Kylong will give you 16ac and 4str. Dragonleg Breaches are dropping in
price and also look at Cold Steel armour (Heavy, no stats but good AC)
Waiste, Chitinous Belt
Hands, Crystal Chitin Gaunts as an AC improver + Str and Mana.

You may want to look at a haste Item, as well.

Two ways of making plat, Level and let the items and loot come or Farm and
slow your levelling.

My current tip for Farming would be Mistmoore, I cleared most of the zone in
an attempt to get Bards to tolerate me again (it worked) but in your case,
stay outside the buildings unless you have brought a friend or two. Drops,
Fine Steel, Small Bronze armour, Gargoiyle Eyes (only off Gargoyles
obviously) Essence of moon light and the odd piece of Jewellery. FS weapons
and Bronze armour you will already know of their value, Gargoyle eyes sell
for 9pp to merchants and Essence of Moonlight sells in the Bazaar to
armourers (I ask 20pp each and that is undercutting everyone else)
