Y'all know I am new so I won;t go into that part.... I think that most
here that have read and responded to me posts know that I am trying
hard to get a handle on the detail of the game so here is a "Bell
Weather" definition question. It will help be judge these kinds of
comments in the future.

I hear a lot of people talk about getting "Good Experience". I am just
curious, What do you consider "Good" experience?

To me, in my limited exposure to this game thus far feel that just
about ANY experience is GOOD experience! Actually, fighting anything
dark blue solo is good for me.
