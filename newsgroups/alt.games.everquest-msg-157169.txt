Umm... that made no sense whatsoever. Verant's code IS Eq, hence, the
problem is in Verants code. Its going to happen again and again. Its
going to happen in EQ2. Its going to happen in SWG. Its going to
happen in any evolving online game. The beauty of online games is they
are always changing (hopefully usually for the better lol). Thats why
we pay the monthly fee. Thats why (in my opinion) they are superior to
a static single player game. With this wonderful evolving universe,
comes growing pains. Its one of the aspects of online games we have to
get used to.

Alot of people bitch and moan about patches (not saying you are - just
in general) and "why didnt they test this"? Well, they did. On the
test server. Are these people who complain helping out by playing on
the test server? Of course not. Theres a big difference in testing in
a small environment then unleashing in a large production environment.
No amount of testing can prepare code for the masses completely.
Things are going to happen.
