I got a Haste of Mithanil item today, Cog Encrusted Shoulders or
something like that... nice upgrade from the Weight of the Gods I
used to wear, although I'll sure miss the name of that item.

Anyway, in addition to the stats, it has focus effect Haste of
Mithaniel on it.

Worn, this seems to be a spell haste, affecting only limited
spell types.

Heals and buffs and even, I think, non damage debuffs, seem to be
affected, while DD are not.  Haven't looked at DOTs yet, but I
assume they are also not affected.

CHeal is not affected, nor are spells with an original cast time
under 3 seconds... which is to say, the bulk of cleric spells are
not affected!

A 4.0 cast time spell casts in 3.2 seconds with the item worn.

This also stacks with the Blessing of the Reverent effect, so
that same 4.0 cast time spell casts in 2.8 seconds.  I didn't
check to see if it stacks with the mage summon for spell haste, I
assume it doesn't.

It Does work on Gate, which I can cast in 3.2 seconds with item
plus BOR.

Thus far my excitement level over the effect is limited, as I
say, most of my spells cast too quickly to be affected, and of
course the one spell I'd really love to be 25% faster casting,
CHeal, also is immune.  I usually don't even bother keeping BOR
on myself because the duration is so low, its not worth
maintaining.

Haste of Solusek, I assume, is the same sort of thing, only for
the spells that Mithaniel doesn't work for, the DD, perhaps the
DOTs, that sort of thing.
