  The consoles went through more boom/bust cycles though.  Atari and
Coleco used 6502/Z80 tech respectively (can't remember which CPU model
exactly in each one), and essentially they were -- like current
consoles -- basic PCs with game loaders on them.  All the consoles
used ROM cartridges then, and the gaming-oriented PCs did as well.
Commodore's VIC20 and C64 and the Atari 400/800 line were the best
examples, and Atari's computer and console lines were sometimes
compatible in software.

  The Apple/PC market for games in that period was entirely different.
Neither machine was well designed for game playing in that era
(pre-mouse, soundcard, and hi-color graphics), so the games tended to
gameplay/intellectual demands.  For all practical purposes, the game
computer/console market was fairly parallel, much like the current
console/PC market now (the X-Box especially looks like that).

  OTOH, computers had lots of shareware and low cost games, which the
consoles just couldn't afford.  A ROM cart costs enough that you
couldn't do a cheap game on them, and development/licensing
restrictions (as now) limited who could develop in any case.

  A *lot* of companies went bust as tech shifted, computer games got
more sophisticated.  It took a while for Nintendo to reestablish the
console market, Sega joined in, Atari never got back in the game (the
current Atari company has nothing to do with the original, other than
the name).

  Fast forward 10 years to 1995, and finally, PC games get a chance to
outshine the consoles.  Primarily, this is due to Win95/DirectX, which
fixes the eternal problems of making DOS and Win3.1 (essentially DOS)
work as the core of a gaming system.  But the new improved sound and
video hardware let the PC blow away the consoles at that time.

  Of course, nothing ever stands still.  The same year, Sony came out
with the Playstation, which forever transformed the console software
market.  Others had done nice innovations, but the PSX had it all
together.

  The game market exploded, both console and PC.  Where we go in the
future, I don't know, but the PS2/Xbox point to an upgrade path for
consoles, which otherwise was always the power of the PC -- you can
run 20 year old games on a PC (not always easily, but there are ways).

  Vivendi shutting down its game divisions won't kill them, but it can
mess things up a lot as the people/organizations move.  As long as
there is a good market for game development (PC and console), there
will always be a place for good game developers.
