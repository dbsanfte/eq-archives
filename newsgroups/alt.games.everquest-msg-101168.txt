Heh. I'm sorry, but shamans can't wear shroud of nature, and most of
my actual good pieces are no drop (The mediocre ones that are
droppable and not druid only will end up on my cleric smith-to-be,
eventually).
I lose 9 wis (and gain 40 mana) by using sbs instead of cgs, and lose
a total of 10 wis by wearing gnomeskin instead of the shroud and
gatorscale legs. I had the gnomeskin 5 levels ago, but my wis at that
time was not high enough to allow me to wear it on a daily basis and
feel good about my mana pool.

By the way, I once saw 8 wis shaman shoulders drop near zone-in in
Chardok.
