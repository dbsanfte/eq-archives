Well, me and some friends decided to improve out RoS faction,
so we go to MM,  with
57 cleric
58 chanter
56 wiz (me)
57 wiz
54 bard

I pulled out my trusty Staff of Temp. Flux and put my epic rune up,
went in Pulled half the damn MM castle to the zone,
It was the biggest massive thing I have ever seen in my EQ life,
After a frantic mess of AE, before me lay around 39 bodies of DE's =)
It was the most fun I have ever had in EQ.
(after 2 hours the cleric got bored and decided to pull, but that's another
story :))
