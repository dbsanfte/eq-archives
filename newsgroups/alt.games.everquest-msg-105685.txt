Nah, they just don't want them totally outrageously and unbalancingly
twinking them. Both of those items are the far end of the spectrum of
overtwinking. You can twink in great gear without a weapon that procs
a 180 point DD or a tunic which regens HP faster than mobs can remove
it at low level. Such items should have been limited to begin with.

I for one would be happy with new fungi tunics have a rec level of 50,
which would make the regen not work before 50. That would mean for the
first time one would be very affordable for my level 56 character. I
don't have 30 k plat to spend on one for my main, let alone my twink
like outrageous twinkers do. That is the only reason why the item
costs 30 k plat, demand for outrageous twinking. Making them the
common drop and a rec level of 50 would slash the fungi prices on
servers down to a reasonable and appropriate 3 k plat or less.
Meanwhile anyone with the "non nerf" ones could sell them for 60 k
plat to anyone goofy enough to twink so outrageously.
