Apparantly this isn't on the same scale as cleric and shaman tricks
of a similar nature, or what on earth are people complaining about?

At any rate, no, I'm not proposing here another massive regen
over short time (a HOT similar to CE) but rather that the current
regen line or one like it be scaled up to more useful levels at the
high end.  Perhaps the fix would be as simple as doubling the
regen rate on PCs over 50, or adding a high end regen that stacks
with the existing regen line

None of these ideas have been thought out carefully or scaled
out for balance, I'm simply proposing angles of attack on the
"druids are lousy healers" problem that wouldn't be as boring
as "give them CHeal"
