Yes you should have more Wis, especially if you solo. Don't listen to people
that tell you that Ac, or stats are important. At29+ a druid can ONLY kill
things solo with spells (i.e. kiting) so your ONLY concern is +wis. Later
this will change, and AC, resists and stats DO become more important. Since
you have only 121 wis WITH ToV, its pretty safe to assume you don't have
much of anything in +wis gear, so here's a few easy ones for you to get.

Go to the Spires of Split Paw in SK and pick up SP gloves, +3wis... you may
need to group to accomplish this.

Then head to Gorge of King Xorbb off EK and hunt the Evil Eyes for Polished
Bone Bracelets. Also +3 wis and you can pick up two of them.

Next take all the money you make from porting and go sit in EC. Just sit
there and wait for someone to auction +wis items you can afford and buy
them. Bind yourself there and as a bonus you can port people out making
money while you wait.
