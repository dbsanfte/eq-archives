..listen there are plenty of people in EQ that would galdly for 1000pp spend a
hour or two power lvling you vs some monsters 10 lvls above you.....and watch
as you lvls skyrocket...i was getting about 4 lvls a hour from doing this.went
from lvl 32 to 45 for about 3000pp and i think it was well worth it..since now
i can solo and get some desent loot.
