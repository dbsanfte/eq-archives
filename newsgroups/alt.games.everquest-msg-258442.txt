I understand that when the gnoll adopted by the Millers in West Karana
has a shovel you can loot it once you've killed him. I never did this
so I don't know for sure at that but I think that one is not No Drop.

I used a shovel (4/27) with my ranger fear kiting mammoths in EF (when
they were db, so not applicable to you at 53) and I remember taking a
whole stamina bar and thensome plus two or three casts of snare, aside
from the repeated Panic Animals, before it fell over. =)
