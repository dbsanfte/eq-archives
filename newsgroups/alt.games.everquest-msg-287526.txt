There was a time when I would have agreed with you, but then again, there 
was no need for this change back then. Now, it's nigh impossible to get 
enough people together to help someone get flagged, even in a guild. The 
player base has moved on to later content. Getting them to raid older 
content is tough enough. Getting them to help with flagging *and* raid that 
content is just more than the typical player can expect.
