And that's the key.  Rogues can mitigate damage extremely well at lower
levels.  Where AC is not as big an issue, rogues have dodge, parry, block?,
and can wear the same ac/hp armor that the shaman can wear...so the question
is, does the loss of backstab make up for the difference in being able to
"evade" more hits?  I'm not to sure, but it would seem the melee/defensive
skills of the rogue would more then compensate for damage of a backstab at
lower levels (of course then your skill at it would suck heh).
