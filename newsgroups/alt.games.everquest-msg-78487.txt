So I started a post as LoTR and the guys took it over, talking about things
I wasn't talking about, like the Silmarillion... yeah, I thought it sucked
too... terrible book, compared to the others... I went again last night to
see the flick, and I'll go again before Thursday, when it leaves our fine
state. Ok, yeah, I have a thing for Legolas (who is not seen often enough in
the film to suit ME) But, I also have something to say for the film
itself... I read the book, long ago. I'm not a Tolkien fanatic, thinking
*every* word should be included, as some are (not to bash or flame, by any
means)... but I have to say that I really loved the movie (Legolas
notwithstanding). It wasn't perfectly reconciled to Tolkien's dream (book),
but I really think that he would have approved.

Of course, this comes from someone who has seen the film 5 times and is in
lust with Legolas... do with it what you will... flames??



ladies?? might I hear from you??



Darklet
