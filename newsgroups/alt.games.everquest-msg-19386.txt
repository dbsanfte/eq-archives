That doesn't seem like EQ has anything to do with it.
A newer Guild Member, upon finding out that one of the officers was female,
immediately asked if she was single. There had been no "friendly" exchanges
before this, in fact, as I said he only just fouind out she was a she. As it
goes, no she isn't, she is married, to another of the Guild officers (they
were married before EQ, btw) I was left wanting to say something but not
wanting to upset either party, decided against it. How desperate do you have
to be immediately start "checking someone out" as soon as you find out they
are female. I can understand how relationships could develope online but
surely it requires time, not just a "I'm a  girl"
"Really? I'm interested"

I take it Briann is your Husbands name or I do not want to know the details
of your relationship ;ï¿½)
