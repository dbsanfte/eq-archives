I wouldn't worry about it - I'm a level 23 Enchanter and it's happened
to me.  I was running to find some mobs the The Overthere with my
charmed Rhino in tow.  Then, oddly, my Rhino just keeled over and died.
Looking around there was a 60+ Necro standing by.  I guess he thought
that I was running from the Rhino and decided to help.... just as he
started casting his nuke charm broke allowing the nuke to land and the
Rhino to die.

I lost the xps from the Rhino but I understood that the guy was just
trying to help someone who looked like they were in trouble.  Chances
are your guy knew what was happening too.
