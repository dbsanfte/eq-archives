I specifically meant the vexthal shard camp from Maidens.

Having it ONLY drop from a named mob, making the named mob an ultra fucking
rare, AND making the named only have a 1 in 3 chance of dropping it..  man
im sorry, but thats just too much for the average player.  Add to that 2
different guilds getting vt keys at a similar time, and you have the zone
and camp from hell.

As for other players.. well........

I honestly didn't mind the level 24 monk who ran to our camp wanting some
nodrop weapons (without asking or invitation), I didn't mind the fact she
had 1/4 the fucking zones agro on her and dumped it all on my group... the
rival guilds repeated trains during the shard camping, the most absolutely
retarded comments you could ever imagine in ooc, etc etc....

Its a horrible camp, in a truly noobish zone.  I think theres several
problems here though-
1) Bad quest design.  Re-think the ME shard please!  I dont care about it
taking a while, but take so many rules out of the damn equation.
2) Bad zone design.  Theres FAR too many wandering mobs, infact far too many
mobs in general for the zone period.
3) Retards who exp there.   /oocing "druids cast SoW on Goner as he runs
past you, thats my pet thanks" over and over, and /ooc "SOMEBODY HEAL
ME!!!!!!!!!" whilst dumping his pull over your sitting clerics head isn't
being a bit of a nuisance, its being fucking retarded.   Note were not
talking once here, were talking all day every day.

Of course there is ignore, but that is even more of a liability, cuz then
you don't get warning of his many repeated train calls.

That of couse isnt even mentioning the griefers who see you get a named
scout pop after 10 hours camping, train the living crap out of you, then
solo your named and sell looting rights to it.

Yeah, I hate Maidens Eye, and I hate the people who exp there.   With a
passion.

grrrrr

Rant over :)
