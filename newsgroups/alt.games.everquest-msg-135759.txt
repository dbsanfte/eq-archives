I frequent many an establishment that have signs right on the wall
that says "we reserve the right to refuse business to anyone for any reason".
( and I kinda like thoes kinda places too!)

How would you enforce this ?  Lots of private mens clubs out there.

Is that right huh ???  Ever hear of a "protest"?, a boycott ?  Thoes are
just the "legal" ones.  You then got the whole social human-interaction
thing where a gang of school kids gang up on "McFly" ...

Actually, that *would* make things worse for Joe.  You really expect
a group of Military personnel to just say, "Oh, yea, shit, thats right,
there's a new law on the books that says we gotta be nice to gay Joe - 
ain't that right Joe? hey Joe, come up here - we wanna be nice to ya here....

...a little social reality is in order here.
