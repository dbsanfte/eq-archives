I have a 48th Shammy that is always welcome on any guild raid we do.
Working with an Enchanter and a Mage I find that I can land slows even
on a 65th lvl mob.  Tashani and Malosi work well in tandem :)

However slow is a major taunt and you will find that unless you have a
good tank you will die alot :)  Those mobs really don't like being
slowed and debuffed :)

This is my favourite of all my characters I've played so far
