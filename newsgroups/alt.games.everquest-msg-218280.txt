Wow.  Um, if a mob is mezzed or rooted, slow it, it won't be attacking 
you, and the MT will need to taunt it so that the enchanter does not get 
agro when mez breaks.  Do not wait for a mob to be at 80% to slow.  
Personally, in xp groups, I malos on incoming, and slow when I can cast 
it.  If the tank is a knight class, I never get agro, if it's a warrior, 
I get smacked a couple times by a slowed mob, that's what my heal spells 
are for.  Personally, I always slow all the mobs in the camp, this does 
mean that sometimes I am grabbing agro, but, I can take a beating for a 
bit from a slowed mob, and, it's much easier for the enchanter or bard to 
mez a mob that is beating on me rather than them.  In a raid, I slow 
after I am reasonably confident that I won't get agro from doing so, if 
we are talking about a major target.
