How is it oversimplified?  The item haste values players quote to one
another are computed from observation of:
(NumberOfHastedAttacks/NumberOfNonHastedAttacks)
with the time of the two samples constant.  The formula Wolfie quoted
is exactly and completely correct for that.

Note that this has nothing to do with how VI implements haste in the
game, only with player observations of how the game behaves.
Arguments about the particular value to quote for a particular item
derive from the quality of the testing (and occassionally the desire
of pharmers to inflate the value of items they are selling).  Common
haste items like the FBSS or the Mithril Two-handed Sword have fairly
well-known haste values and little or no argument about these values,
rarer items often get a large range of values quoted for them.
