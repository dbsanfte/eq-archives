Yep, thats it.  No in game reward, no exp, no chance of skill ups.  Little
in the way of consequences if you die, either, you do lose any buffs you
may have had up, and sometimes lose mana or HP ( I think ), but mostly its
just for fun, if you like that sort of thing.  Most people don't do it
often, if at all.

Since most spells are drastically reduced in effectiveness against player
characters, duels are not much of a way to compare effectiveness of
different classes; a better test would be to have the two people compete
to see how many of a given mob they can take down in an hour or something
along those lines.  Even here, different mobs will be easier kills for one
class or another, and then there's class interaction and so forth to take
into account, until really competing in a fair way becomes pretty
difficult, if such things are important to you.

At that, dueling is better than the various arenas in the cities of the
world, where any player can attack any other.  Here, high level "griefers"
lurk hoping to fool low level people in so they can kill them with massive
overwhelming power, with hardly any concern about possible retribution,
since they need only stay clear of such PvP areas themselves when higher
level folk are about.

Point being that you don't lose any exp on death in a duel, so this is a
pretty low consequences way to do this.

Another tactic for people that don't have Gate is to get killed in a duel
as a quick way back to their bind points.  This is a lot less prevalent
among low levels since the POP release made movement around the world so
easy, but its still used by high level characters from time to time.  The
low level people would put all their gear in the bank, get killed, then go
to the bank near their bind point to get their gear back on.  The high
levels use this to go buy gems or other supplies quickly (being bound
right next to the vendor) and then get a rez back to their bodies; another
trick is to die, consent someone to drag your body across an area you
can't cross yourself for some reason, then get that rez to the new
location.  In either of these latter cases, you have just five minutes to
get the rez, so better be fast about it.
