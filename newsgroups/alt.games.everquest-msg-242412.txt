I haven't even had a chance to see these pink icons yet. A friend and I were
installing a new video card in my computer Tuesday evening, and he did
something he really, really shouldn't have...gist of the story is, I've yet
to be able to boot my computer up, let alone play EQ, since then. Hoping to
fix it this eve, just in time to play for a day or 2 before going outta town
for a week. :(
