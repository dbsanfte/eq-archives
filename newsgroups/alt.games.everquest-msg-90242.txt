Hmm... I have a Springwood Club to go with my CGS... +5 Wis, Int and Str
(9/25)... just for pounding on Giants when they're fleeing and I'm low or
out of mana (hits for 30dam - max... and my 1hb is maxxed out)

Greater Wolfform and Strength of Stone (can't wait for 44 and Storm
Strength) put my STR at 117, my Atk around 820... nothing special, but I
think of it as a mana-free DoT.

Is there something I could be doing differently? (Wis 199, +224 mana adds)

Druid 42, no grouping skills whatsoever :o)
