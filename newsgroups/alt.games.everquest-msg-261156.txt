Well, yeah, I don't think faction is a -complete- explanation for all 
random-aggro-on-someone-in-the-rear cases, but it might be an easily 
overlooked one.  I'm sure there were some at that R'D kill with lower 
faction than me, too, but they may have been even further in the back, or 
feigned, or something.  R'D is in some ways a special case, since it's a 
spawned mob with an aggro radius comparable to the size of the room.  So 
she appears and instantly has probably 30-40 people on her hatelist from 
proximity.  So how does she choose among them?  Proximity is probably a 
factor, and that's the factor we'd be most expecting, but something has to 
be able to outweigh it.  It could be she goes for the person with -higher- 
cha, which doesn't make sense, but we have reports here from two folks 
with unnaturally high charisma saying it happened to them...  Faction 
makes sense, so I suspect that's involved.  And we all know not to sit 
when a mob's about to be spawned, right?  And there's that rumor that 
certain illusionary forms may be a problem, although I haven't really 
found that to be the case since the great big illusion-faction nerf a 
couple years ago.

Another possibility is a variation of distance... sometimes it seems that 
aggro distance is based on pathing distance, instead of apparent distance, 
and sometimes the other way.  I'm sure we've all seen spots in the game 
where it seems that you move one foot to the left, and the mob suddenly 
seems to think you're 100' further away, especially in places with twisty 
passageways and stairs and such.

But I suspect faction's involved.  I've noticed sometimes it's even worth 
casting benevolence on a random mob in a zone where I've hunted a lot.  
But I don't have really hard data, so it could just be an illusory 
benefit.
