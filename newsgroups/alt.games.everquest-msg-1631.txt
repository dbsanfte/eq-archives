I wasn't pulling ice bones - I avoid them (especially after getting
killed by one 15 minutes before). I was walking away from my group
looking for crocs. And I said "jumped" because it aggroed on me (as
opposed to the crocs and other Oasis mobs that don't aggro).

Good point. I'll have to remember that. I usually do run straight back.

Spent a week in CB cleaning up other people's trains so, yeah, I know
what a train is. Also got obliterated in BB a couple times. And, I do
shout something appropriate if I do have to bring a train to zone..
something like "BIG HUGE TRAIN TO ZONE w/CRUSH, DVINN & MORE.."
(before I get flamed.. was NOT my pull, not even my group created that
train)

Nope, don't find being called "newbie" offensive at all. Refer to
myself as one all of the time.  I was being sarcastic <again>.. mostly
because I keep being told how different I'll look at things when I've
been playing for a year. So, right now I have a clueless newbie's
perspective on the game. In a year you'll have been playing for 2+
years, so I'll still be a newbie to you. :-)

And, I'm impressed that you've never trained someone in all the time
you've been playing. Especially since it appears so easy to do.

Every minute? More like a few seconds. First I had to figure out where
the skeleton went. Then I asked my partner if the other group had KSed
us again. Then I looked to see what they were doing with the skeleton -
they had already killed the 1st one by that time. Don't really remember
what happened after that. It was 4 am and I was getting a wee bit
punchy.

You know what's funny..I put a certain perspective on what happened
when I made my post. Embelished it a bit. Partly for the humor and
partly because it was a better story. Not expecting to be defending my
actions for four days. [Note to Self: Expect to have Usenet posts
examined under a magnifying glass] But, in all honesty they could have
stolen the kill. They tried to steal other mobs. We really did think
that's what happened at the time. [And, I refuse to argue about whether
they were really KSing or not]

Did you really think I was being serious? Unless I could line up a
select few coworkers along the docks.. then I might consider it!!!
