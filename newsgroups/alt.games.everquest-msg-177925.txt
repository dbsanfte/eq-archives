400W. I don't think I've *seen* a bigger power supply in this town.

Yeah, but basically smothering the processor in goop did seem to have a 
certain effect... it stayed up for about a minute longer than the 
previous best result. I'm almost convinced it's heat-related. I could be 
wrong, but after seven years or so of using PCs for games, I think I'm 
somewhat attuned to how the different systems tend to fail. I could 
swear this isn't a configuration or compatibility problem.

I've had the computer hang at the white on black "Do you want to start 
in safe mode" screen. I really don't think it's a video problem either.

I would do that, except that almost certainly the machine would hang 
well before I'd be finished. :(

Thanks for all the input, though.
