Check with the brokers and you'll see what PC merchants have for sale.
If you buy from the broker there is built into the price you see a 20%
markup. To save that markup you can go directly to the PC's location
(make a note of it including what location they are selling from,
could be from other that PC's house) and buy direct. Once you sell to
an NPC vendor it's gone from the game. No vendor diving in this game
as far as I know.
