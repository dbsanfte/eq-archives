I don't have my map handy, but I'm guessing you're talking about the little
posse of Red Mobs that hang out in the mountains.  If it's those guys:  GO
ROGUE.  I can walk right up to those fellows and they don't bat an eye.

Ask any rogue to drag the corpse away from them.  And don't forget to tip.
(I can't believe the guys that would pay 100p for a rez never think to tip
the corpse dragger)
