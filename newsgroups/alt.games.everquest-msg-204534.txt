Well - as a point of reference, I found it interesting. 

The guild I'm currently in raids 3 times a week guaranteed,
starting at 4pm pst.  Well, my play time starts in the morning
pst and ends at 4pm pst.  I'd decided a long time ago that I
wouldn't give up my evenings with my girlfriend for raids. 

There is, technically, a raid attendence requirement (not all
of them, but the majority of them) which caused me to not seek
an invite, as I knew I couldn't fufill that requirement.  However,
I let my buddy 'bot my mage for ToV CotH duty, and since he's
an officer he convinced the other officers that - as I've never
asked for anything for allowing that, and I group with the guild
on a regular basis (many of whom were in my former guild) - an
exception should be made in my case.

During the times I am on, however, we do a lot of stuff with 
guildies - from 2 grouping Sev (got our usual warrior his epic),
8 person RC kill, single grouping other nameds in UP, PoT keying,
guild xp/exploration groups (still lots of stuff to explore).

It's this sort of single group activity with folks from a guild
that I enjoy most - and the reason LDoN sounds so good to me.
