hmmm...let's see, I'm 44, been in the US Air Force for 25+ years, and am
certainly not pale nor overweight, hitting the base fitness center four
times a week for anaerobic (that's strength training) workouts and spending
a significant amount of time in the Texas sun...so I guess that kind of
shoots a BIG hole in your ill supported theory that was based on a sample
size significantly less than the 400k+ subscriptions to EQ...but feel free
to continue and make generalizations, as posts like your always entertains
me =) ...
