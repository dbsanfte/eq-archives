I was fighting a train in the entrance to Blackburrow when I started
losing. Took a couple of steps and zoned in Qeynos Hills..... but I
appeared at my bind point. 

At first I thought I had died, but I had a few hit points left, all my
spells were still memorized and I had all my gear. Though all my buffs
were gone.

Another thing, since the last patch all the wolves have red heads and
tails and blue feet.
