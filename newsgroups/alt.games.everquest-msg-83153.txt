People can't and aren't expected to go do a search for every name they
come up with to see if there's a trademark or copyright on it, period.
No, they aren't always easily checked, either. Obscurity on
trademarked names is treated just the same.

And, like I said, there's nothing specificly against trademark names.
Easily-recognized trademarks fall under a rule, but nothing about
trademarks specificly.
