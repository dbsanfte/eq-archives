Don't do that...

if I buy a professionally put together system (well... I used to build
systems for a living so I consider mine professionally built, but that's
beside the point) I'm going to go Falcon Northwest or, even better,
Alienware.

I've dealt with the exact problem on a customer's machine, and replaced a
425 watt PS with a 500 and it went away. Though cooling may be your issue.

As far as cooling: Add an exhaust fan to the case somewhere, if nowhere else
one of those slot blowers (but 99% of those suck bigtime). Even an in case
circulation fan can help. On one machine I simply epoxied an 80mm fan to the
case pointing to blow air in the direction of a heatsink, and boom, no more
stability problems.

With thermal compound, you want the thinest layer possible. It's not really
that good a conductor of heat (in fact it kind of traps heat within it) what
you are trying to do is fill in the irregularities (gaps and valleys)
between the supposedly flat surface of the processor and the supposedly flat
surface of the heat sink.

Artic Silver is metallic, and has better heat transfer... again, use very
little. Also, spread whichever mystic cooling gunk you chose on with a
Q-tip,  the oils from your fingers screw it up.

Keep the cables away from the processor if possible (Believe it or not those
overpriced round ide/floppy cables really do help with the airflow).

I've got a Harddrive cooler (3 teeny fans sucking air in from a grill in the
front and blowing over my hot running harddrive), a front intake fan and two
exhaust fans in the back (in addition to the PS fan). Also, there's a 50mm
fan mounted to a spare screw hole that helps circulate air around in the
case. It's loud, though not too bad with the case on. The harddrive cooler
is the worst bit, it's a little shrill.

(You should hear the GeForce MX, I downloaded some sound samples off tom's
hardware guide... thing sounds like a vacuum cleaner.)
