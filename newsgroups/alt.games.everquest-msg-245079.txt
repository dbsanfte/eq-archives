I guess I should have said, pre-Luclin, that is where I did most of my skillups
on the boats.  Also, there are no boats sitting in Nexus for at most 15 minutes
to get to NK.  Or the 5 minutes it takes to run from PoK to Nexus, NL, DSP.  But
I agree just missing the boat is a pain in the butt, means you have to wait at
least half an hour at times.  But, again, this was pre-Luclin.  Now just click
on a boat or hail a Magus or Gnome.
