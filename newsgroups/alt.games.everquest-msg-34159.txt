Am I the only one who this makes crack up? At level 4, I've picked up all
the necessary spells for the most basic fear kite (clining darkness, fear,
disease cloud, poison bolt, pet,) And it cracks me up. I'm currently in the
lake of ill omen (I liked it better than the field of bone, plus,
ironically, decaying skeletons are MORE common, and thus more bone chips)

I haven't tried soloing anything big yet (most I've done was some yellow con
goblins) but usually they're gone before I can get my second DoT off (or
third of you count clinging darkness)

It also seems more effective than normal kiting, since there is much less
risk involved (unless it keeps resisting your snares and fears.)
