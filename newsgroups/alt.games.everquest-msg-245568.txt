   I bet you thought I was just going to forget about all this, didn't
you.  Well, no.  I just was procrastinating on it.  I've made all the
corrections I think, though I wouldn't be shocked to learn that I've
introduced new ones.

   These are easy to explain.  When I created the webpage, I did so by
pasting the wordpad/newsgroup version of the FAQ into my HTML editor, then
adding the HTML tags to make it readable.  Stylistically, I like having two
spaces after each period.  This is how I learned to touch type, and this is
what looks right to me.  But to get two spaces after a period in an HTML
document, I have to use the special character for non-breaking space, which
is &nbsp; .  Rather than typing this is in hundreds of times, I used
cntrl-c to cut it, and cntrl-v to paste it where I felt it should be.  The
places you see a VV?  I accidentally hit shift-v twice instead of cntrl-v.

  See?  Makes perfect sense.

   Anyways, I am trying to get the FAQ in good form for its first official
"post at the beginning of the month" trotting out.  But I am sure there are
still plenty of errors.  It's just hard to string together something that
big with them creeping in!  I just hope that most of them get pointed out
to me so I can fix them.
