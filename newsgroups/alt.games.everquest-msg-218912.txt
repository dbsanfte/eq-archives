I thought this was the idea behind slow mitigating mobs, back
when they introduced them; if a mob takes your 75% slow and turns
it into a 25% slow, then a group with no slower at all isnt' all
that much worse off after all, just as people happily kill mobs
in their 20s without shaman slowers; yes, a 25% slow helps, but
the mobs aren't tuned for it to be critically important and you
can use other approaches.

Sadly, they made the slow mitigating mobs also hit like rabid
wolverines, so that yes, you still do need to slow them just to
have any chance at all, and even so, they are the sorts of mobs
people avoid encountering on a regular basis, going instead after
ones that are equally good exp but not slow mitigating.
