This happened to me the other day also. The guide said it was a "verifiable
bug" and that I would be rezzed with full experience. She told me that they
had just had a meeting about this problem so everyone would treat the
situation the same way. The procedure is to give full xp "customer service"
rez on this situation without question everytime. THough I too now cast
levitate before I port in.
