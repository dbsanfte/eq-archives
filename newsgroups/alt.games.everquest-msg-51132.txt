NEW SKILLS ON TEST

Recently a range of new level 1 spells have been added to the spell data on
test.
Interestlingly many of these have similar file information to Lay on Hands
and Harmtouch abilities. It may well be that some of the information on test
are the prelude to the post 50 advancement being made available to casters.

We have compiled a list of the new spells. Note that this information is
purely hypothetical as to the way it will be implemented, what we have
listed is just the basic information available on the spell/skill.

As always with test keep in mind this will probably change and may not even
go live.
