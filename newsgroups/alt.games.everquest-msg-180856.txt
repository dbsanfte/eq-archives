I'm a total EQ addict I think.  I had to go out on launch day and buy 
EQOA.  Little hint--don't even bother going to Walmart anymore, they are 
ijits.  Bought at EBX aka EBgames aka Electronics Boutique.  They had a 
stack of them and the network adapters.

Of course my first character is an elf druid named Bebinn.  I'm on 
Hodstock server if anyone wants to join me sometime.  Send mail to 
Bebinn ingame, there is a nifty mail feature not everyone knows about.

I'll be working on collecting coaches later on I think, so I'll be able 
to get almost anywhere in Tunaria.

If you need tips, send me mail ingame with your questions, I'll try to 
help.  First thing anyone playing EQOA needs to do is complete the 
newbie quest, I won't bother helping you if you are still level 1 after 
3 days of play, takes five minutes of walking around to get level 2, and 
no bashing critters even.

See ya
