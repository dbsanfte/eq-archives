At least there is sort of a reason for that.  Actually, there are two
reasons: the one they've given, and the real one.

The reason they give is that they don't want the Mac people to start out at
a disadvantage, playing on servers full of Windows people who are already
many levels ahead.

That's pretty bogus, for at least two reasons:

(1) They don't seem to show similar concern for new Windows users.  Instead
of making a Mac-only server, make a new-account-only server.

(2) Even if they are going to make Mac-only servers, why not allow Mac users
to also play on the old servers, so those who have Windows-using friends who
play can play with them?

Most likely, the *real* reason for this is that they are outsourcing OS X
EQ.  They don't want to deal with the management problem of having two
independent development teams at different companies having to release
patches at the same time.  So, they know the Windows client and the OS X
client are going to get out of sync, and so they need to have separate
servers.
