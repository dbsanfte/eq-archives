Now that he Bazaar works, I'd like to try to find myself some good Dark Elf
Necro items for sale (I'm almost LV23).  I've currently got about 550pp in
the bank (after having bought all LV24 spells, except for 2 less important
ones I can't find, and the 2 research ones).  I'm wearing an Advisors robe,
Silver Engagement Ring (think that's the one, it has +2 INT), a +3 INT, +30
Mana (no drop) GM event ring (from today).  The rest of me is in cloth armor
(looted from orc pawns).

Now that the Bazaar works, no more wasting time in EC selling pelts and
other stuff like that.  I just bank it all, then go to Bazaar later & log on
to sell, then leave for work & hope I don't get disconnected.  I also like
the search interface too.  I looked at quite a few DE Necro +INT jewelry
this evening, but wasn't sure what would or wouldn't be a good buy for me.

WE CAN FINALLY OPEN ALL 16 CONTAINERS AND THE BANK AT THE SAME TIME!!!

Will this be the new UI for EQ2? (with a few improvements...but the same
basic thing?)
