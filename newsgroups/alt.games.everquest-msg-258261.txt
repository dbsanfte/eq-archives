I don't see that they're anything even close to similar.  In fact, they seem
to be the exact opposite.  These quests were meant to be solved, as an
unsolvable quest serves no purpose.  The Sleeper was never meant to be
killed.   It's not a matter of the players finally finding a way to do what
they were supposed to... its a matter of the players finding a way to break
the encounter.

Also, how they "beat" the Sleeper had little to do with gear, other than one
piece which had been in the game before the Sleeper was added.
