At level 65, I split my xp, as I want a comfortable margin into 65, and, 
I am working at maxxing out 65 in anticipation of the next expansion as

There was an issue with splitting xp at one point, where you did lose a 
noticable amount when you split.  To the best of my knowledge, that issue 
is long since resolved.
