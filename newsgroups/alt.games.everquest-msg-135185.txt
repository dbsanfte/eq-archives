Well depends, look at an ntov flurry drake :)

Killing velketor would probably be a better starting path for your guild
tho, rather than doomshade/RC/vindi.
I think once your confident about taking Velk down, you can move onto Vindi,
Doomshade, RC and have a real chance.   If Velk is too high of a starting
point, go pwn the Va'dyn some first :)

Rampage isnt really a problem on lesser mobs like RC, Kael giants etc
(compared to ssra stuff).  That day I was the only shaman there, old slow
laggy computer, not even fm, and no pull warning heh.  I was memming debuffs
(had buffs up) so didn't even see him coming, so didn't even get him malod
till he was already in the camp.

I did die to rampage, but that was after Malo, Slowing and Crippling him,
then focusing back on the monk screen.  Getting the shaman there was slow
cuz luclin wasn't even installed on the comp heh, so by the time i did get
there I didn't have time to get a group.  Saw him rampage me, cast torpor on
myself, then couldnt move out of his agro radius in time to live, because of
the torpor snare.  Oh well.

haha ns.  was like.. "/gui gonna quickly kill this gimp mob then find the
horse while we wait for the people to do RC"
he gets there, flurry flurry flurry, tank_01, and tank_02 both dead right
off.. oh shit.. "/gui did any clerics actually have mana on the pull?"

He's not an uber mob.. but hes not the kind of mob you just pull without
warning (normally we make sure clerics, tanks, debuffers and mana-makers are
ready).. oh well lesson learnt, and he did drop first time :)

The bow is almost primal quality.. add to that the chance of a 41% haste
earring and hes worthy of killing on each RC run.   We got the bow and 2 pos
weapons (grats random_person in the zone).  We've had a lot of bp's and
tunics from RC, but I think a major force behind killing him is on prexus,
because we have SO FREAKIN MANY upper tier guilds (server split plz thx!!)
you either kill any named stuff that pops, or you might totally miss out on
a raid mob that day.

Our last kill on  TiV and THO gave us 1 crown and 1 helm .. I mean wtf if
your only going to give us *1* item, give us something nice (first time ive
seen only 1 item drop).. of course its still better than our first ever THO
kill.

6 spells, and...  and nothing.  Not a single loot item :(

How is your server for contested mobs?  Im not familiar with all server
splits, but I do know my server is the oldest unsplit one..

We have SIX guilds racing for ST every single pop (not including 2 fully ST
keyed guilds who occasionaly hit the zone).  One guild started clearing the
place out 6 hours before the named were due to pop on Saturday.. I mean
thats ridiculous heh.
"You have entered Sleepers Tomb"
"/ooc camp check?"

3 guilds racing for Tunare every single pop, 3 guilds racing for AoW every
single pop, 6 guilds racing for Statue every pop, 4 guilds racing for Ssra
every single pop, 4 racing for burrower, 4 on first broods.. Tormax doesnt
even last 30mins after popping.. its not the same guilds racing either (some
of the guilds racing for ST and broods don't try any of the other above
stuff, so they add competition for the mobs like TiV, THO, RC, Doomshade.
Dain)

If i count the number of guilds capable of killing at least Vindi (he seem a
good splitoff point).. hmm thats a good 13-14 guilds (and probably at least
10 able to also clear statue, tormy etc).. add to that the guilds who
alliance together to kill upper mobs.. and thats 1 busy as hell over camped
server :/

How does your server compare?
