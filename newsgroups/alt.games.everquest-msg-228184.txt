And that is the key to remember. People want to be able to pvp, but they 
need a system that works and makes sense. EQs pvp simply doesn't work. 
It is far to easy to gank somebody.

There should be faction so that pks can't go near civilizations they've 
screwed with, in a game with 'zones' there should be an immunity period 
to ensure you can't get chain stunned by a pali and enchanter while the 
necros and druids nuke/rot you ... before you even know whats happening.

Perhaps there needs to be 'bounty' so that bringing back the head of a 
pkr is worth good loot...but only if done by a non-pkr. One of the 
biggest flaws with many pvp systems is that the 'good guys' simply get 
nothing out of fighting back, they can't 'win' in any real sense, they 
can't progress, they can't loot because the greifer never carries 
anything droppable, there is simply no percentage in fighting back.

Perhaps once your 'griefer' rating hits a certain point dying, if a 
non-pkr/bounty hunter, manages to drop you, bans the account for 15 
minutes or 30, or 45... attach a real significance to dying, and a real 
incentive for the non-greifer community to put the boots to these guys...

Perhaps if your greifer rating hits a low enough point people can take 
quests to enable them to perma death you if they manage to kill you...

Perhaps your alts need to share a last name and faction reputation so 
that you can't greif with one guy and be joe-good-reputation with the 
other. (yeah i know this farks with rp... but its a small sacrifice to 
make, and it beats only having one character)

Will it stop greifing? Hell no. But that isn't the point, we can reduce 
greifing to a managed in game activity... with rules to balance it. If 
the anti-rpk players on pvp servers could actually dervice a real 
benefit from hunting rpks it would go a long way towards making taking 
19 random deaths in a row worthwhile...
