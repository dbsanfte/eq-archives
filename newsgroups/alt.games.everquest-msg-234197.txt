GameVoice is a bit resource heavy on older systems.

MSN Messenger is also ok, for 2 people, although the Microsoft
offerings (both messenger and gamevoice) can be bitches to get going
if people are running firewalls. Subjectively I think it has the best
voice quality.

Roger Wilco is solid. Easy to setup, firewall configuration is
straightforward. I think voice quality is the worst though.

Yahoo Messenger is also a very good voice chat/conference program,
very easy to setup, runs through most firewalls without configuration
in my experience, and not a resource pig. It is my first choice for
voice chat.  Subjectively I find its voice quality is quite superior
to roger wilco's, almost as good as MSN.
