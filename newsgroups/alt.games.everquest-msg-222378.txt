I'm just now back into EQ from Star Wars Galaxies.  SWG was nice eye candy,
but just wasn't my cup of tea.  I gave it a good try.  Made master and saw
all the high-level zones ... even saw C3PO, R2D2, and the others.
Unfortunately, it got old quick, raising skills was more mind-numbing than
the worse EQ camp (at least in EQ you don't have to do constant repetitive
button pushing while sitting on your behind), and never felt any sense of
accomplishment.  Anyway, after a long time away from EQ, I'm back.  I've
purchased the dungeon expansion to do the adventures but not the frog
expansion.  I previously had all other expansions.

What I'd appreciate is some advice on how best to upgrade my cleric's gear.
I do not have a lot of money (~7,000 plat) and would really rather
quest/hunt for my gear than buy it from the bazaar.  I want to do this
partly for the feel of accomplishment and partly because I just never seem
to make a lot of money.  However, if there's usually a really good deal on
an item in the bazaar, I'd be up for hearing about it.

Currently my cleric is 58 and halfway to 59.  I plan to keep doing
adventures until I'm 60 and so any gear questing/hunting will be as a 60 lvl
cleric.  And I'm a healing cleric and not a battle cleric.  Now onto a
listing of my gear.  Suggestions on how I should upgrade it will be greatly
appreciated.
