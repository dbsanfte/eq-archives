I handle things a bit differently. I know there are people on my no-rez 
list, and i feel perfectly free in telling them why i will not rez them. 
If they get really snotty with me and go past the point of abuse, i 
report them.

I also know that there are just some people that I or someone in my 
group will not group with because they have a past [like the jerk in 
question.] I always ask people if they have any objections to anybody 
being invited into the group, and if someone objects they dont get 
invited. I also make it very plain that if whoever the group leader is 
insists on inviting someone I have an objection to, i will tell the 
leader exactly why i will not group with that person, and if he still 
insists, i apologize and leave the group. I am always very polite, but i 
will not group with someone i have experience with that i know i cn not 
trust. I have the reputation of being an honerable player, and keeping 
my group alive through some very bad pulls. I never have problems 
grouping, and in general get tells as soon as i go into LFG mode.

If you feel guilty about not rezzing the jerk, then why not send him a 
tell next time he is on and apologize, and explain why you were mad at 
him.  If he persists in acting like a jerk after that, then move him to 
the ignore list.
