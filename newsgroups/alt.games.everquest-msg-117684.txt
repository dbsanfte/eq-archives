If your router firmware is newer than 1.40.2, this will happen. There was a
thread about this on the EQ forums somewhere, and it helped my LD problems
to go back to that version. I guess the newer firmware thinks the EQ servers
are trying to hack your computer, instead of reconnecting, so it blocks the
connection.

Hope that helps some.
