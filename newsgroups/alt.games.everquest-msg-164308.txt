Yes, Wiki organized one for ours....he gathered a listing of the newbie
armor items in one zone, plus other low level drops. If you were below a
certain level you were encouraged to partner with someone higher level who
could keep you alive during your hunt. We did this in Steamfont, so items
included a mino horn, harpy wing, brownie part, bone chip, spiderling silk,
etc. Had you run all over the zone killing everything. He had a set time
limit for it. Person with most gets a prize.

Then he held a loc-spotting contest. Ask the loc of places... but the
question was in the form of a riddle, so you had to guess what he meant.

He was very good at planning this so no one KOS (like me) had to seriously
put their lives on the line. That's what yer buddy is for (or self-invis).

We had a great time. We also passed around the booze and lev'ed everyone.
One gathering my old guild had, we tried to get on top of the dwarf statue
in BBM. Invis dropping there is just awkward.
