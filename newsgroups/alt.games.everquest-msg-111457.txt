who said anything about skipping levels dumbass?  

I'm saying I probably won't play EQ2.  I am not talking about playing
EQ2, I'm talking about playing EQ. 

how can you understand the attitude when you didn't even hear what I
said?  Funny that you call them commie/nazi then complain about my
bitchin, thats good one, shows your depth of thought.

does verant expect me to play characters in EQ2 just to leave those
behind also when they decide to bring out EQ3?

I'm not into that, there are some things about online gaming communities
that verant doesn't understand or doesn't care about, try to just your
little mind around before you spew the standard reply of a clueless
flamer.
