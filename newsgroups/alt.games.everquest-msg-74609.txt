I do, to a point, see where he is coming from, that the others are flaming
on.  A few of my favorite people are lvl 60... but there are a TON of 'back
in the game' level 60s hording mobs.   Seb has a huge issue of this.  Last
night, out of 39 people when I first logged in, only 5 of us were under lvl
60.  (Only 1 level 60 in there was not a baron/ess or Mistress).

It sort of sucked seeing a group of 3 lvl 60s overtake NG with primal (&
fists of lightning) and full Kael armor... and not accepting 2 or 3 other
lower than lvl 60 players to share out the experience and fill up the group.
Though.. they died after about 30 minutes.

But I digress.   I love grouping with lvl 60s, and I cant what till I hit it
in a month or 2 (Though I think Ill be a baron by lvl 59.2).
