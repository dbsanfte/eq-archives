My guild went in and tried AOW yesterday for the first time.

We went in to kill Vindi and SORZ (grats me on ST key...or
condolences might be more in order) and the Idol was up.  Well,
we had a strong force there and ready, and no other targets up
(killed Klandi before coming to Kael) so we decided to give it a
try.

Moved to our pull spot, set up as best we knew how, and pulled
idol.  Took it down with some effort unslowed, so we figured we
had a decent shot at AOW.  Pulled AOW over, didn't go as well.
We lost two monks and the MA on the pull itself, SA fell about 50
seconds in to the fight.  After that things stabilized a bit, but
we kept losing melee for reasons I'm not clear on, and eventually
started losing more Assists.  Bodies litttering the floor, I res
sticked a dead cleric before getting chomped myself.

Well, sadly, the AOW doesn't wander off, so we had to wait till
he despawned in order to rez the wipe.  I think we got him down
to 50%, although he was at 60% when I died, apparantly a pretty
amazing regen rate.

Talking to a higher tier guildmate friend, what probably killed
us was the flurry; when we'd been told unslowed idol was the same
as AOW, we missed the fact that this is ONLY his direct melee
output.  AOW was chewing away just as hard as unslowed idol...
and then every now and then he'd slam out a bunch of extra damage
we weren't expecting.  On top of this, what was chopping up the
rest of the melee crew was apparantly rampage, this I'm less
clear on, didn't see any rampage messages but might have missed
it in the spam.

At any rate, the other thing I'm told is that other guilds are
now mad at us for trying AOW and failing.

I'm confused about this for many reasons:

1) the mob was up, there's no list for it, we tried it.  Seems
fair to me.

2) how would things be different if we'd succeded?  Mobs gone
either way.

3) how do you know if you can do something until you try?  We
-did- do idol unslowed.  And we did get AOW to 60% (maybe 50%)...
in fact I'm pretty sure we'll succede in one or two more tries.

4) STFU, you snooze you lose, and other rantlike expressions.

Unless failing means a longer respawn time than success, I really
can't see the point.
