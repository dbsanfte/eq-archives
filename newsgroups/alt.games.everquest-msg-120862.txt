As you say... "Power isn't determined simply by ability to solo" nor
is it determined by how usefull you are in a group/raid/guild.
please do not get me wrong... Yes a Cleric has the BEST healing
spells... That "is" their job... I dont have sow, port, damage shield,
etc....  That "is not" my job....  
I do not feel we are Way to powerfull... we are as powerfull as we
need to be for our job.... as is a druid, ranger, SK, necro, warrior
etc....

I definitly respect you and your opinions Dark... keep em comming
