  I think the Shissar, for the most part, kept to Kunark, and when they did
set up outposts on other continents, I don't think they bothered bringing
too many of their slaves with them.  At the time, ogres and other children
of Rallos ruled most of the rest of Norrath.  I believe that the Shissar
were loosely aligned with the ogres and that it was they who faccilitated
transport to the Planes of Power so the ogres and giants could mount their
raids.   I think that Greenmist was a curse similar to the one that
afflicted the ogres and giants... it wasn't just a plague, but rather a
curse that caused them to become lesser creatures.

  It's possible that the Lizardmen that inhabit the Accursed Temple of
Cazic-Thule are Norrath's remaining Shissar (those who were on Kunark
managed to escape or were destroyed.)  It makes sense, since the temple has
one of the "Combine" pyramids within it, and pyramids are a recurrent theme
throughout the temple... just as it is a recurring architectual theme in
those areas that Shissar inhabit on Luclin.  Though it's possible that it
was a Shissar temple that the Lizardmen moved into after the Shissar took
off and/or died, or that the Lizardmen built their temple around the pyramid
created by the Shissar earlier.

  Or it's possible that I'm all wrong.  Apparently the Planes of Power is
supposed to introduce a sort of "library" area that will have books and
scrolls related to EQ lore (that also serve to point you in the right
direction for quests).  If there is some connection between the Shissar, the
children of Rallos and the Planes of Power, that expansion is likely to shed
some light on the subject.

  I am pretty strongly convinced that the Shissar made the teleport
quadroliths/pyramids though... since those that aren't pyramids, the
"quadroliths", feature glyphs on them that appear to resemble a side view of
a coiled cobra.  Al'Kabor concluded that the Combine Empire didn't make the
pyramids/spires.  We know the Vah Shir didn't make them because nothing
indicates that and they were forcefully ejected from Norrath long after the
Combine Empire arose.  The only remaining civilization that is known to have
existed on both Norrath and Luclin are the Shissar, so it must've been them.
