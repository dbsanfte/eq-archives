In Netscape Communicator it kept opening windows addressed to abuse
somewhere, i used ctrl alt del and end task to stop it.  I think it's
that same ass that has been posting viruses and nonsense email messages
all over usenet.  Was posting spam during the terrorist attack, to many
newsgroups consisting of random word generated sentences with an .exe
file attachment.
