Good heavens.  You posted this note at first at 3:35 by my news server's
reckoning, and have been here for 2 and a half hours firing off
rapid-fire replies to others, yourself, dust mites, whomever.  The
cheese has truly fallen off your cracker.  

You're clearly letting this rule your life.  It's going to be a
beautiful day today in the Midwest.  Go *do* something enjoyable; have
fun.  Kiss your loved ones.  Hopefully there will be many such days in
all of our futures.  If not, enjoy the ones we have, and don't let the
fear of how dreadfully tenuous the future is possess your consciousness.

BTW--history is at least as full of doom-saying prophets as it is
"nay-sayers"...
