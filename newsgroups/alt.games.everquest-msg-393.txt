    Crafted still costs a fortune when you quest for it. You need to by
expensive gems to turn in with the main quest item. I even saw a Crafted
Bracer for sale for less than it cost me to do the quest. At level 27, you
should be able to kill an Evil Eye in the Gorge of King Grobb with a
partner. If one of you gets charmed, the other should run up the side of the
wall and wait for it to wear off, for some reason the charmed player cannot
hit you there. They drop the optic eye nerve pretty regularly. Greaves
should be pretty easy, though once again you should have a partner. You need
to kill Trazdon in Najena for his Circlet. Camp his placeholders, and jump
them as soon as they spawn so they can't summon pets. I was there about
three hours, it's really boring, the entire dungeon is on an 18 minute spawn
timer. Trazdon spawned twice in a row near the end, and dropped the circlet
the second time. You only run into a few wandering ogres to get to his spawn
point. Stay away from Mistmoore for a while though, I have gotten a couple
parties killed trying for a Werewolf Talon :P The wizard evil eyes in
Runnyeye seem much tougher than the Gorge ones, I have had no luck there
yet, and you need to get three different pieces of a rune.
