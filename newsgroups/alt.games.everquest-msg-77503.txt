Not sure about the ones on Norrath, but on Luclin, I regularly ported up
there, went to a pad, sat on it for a few minutes, as much as 5 or more,
only to be notified that the port would occur in 15 minutes.  It did then
occur about 15 minutes later, making for a total of 20 or more minutes
between ports down.

On Norrath, every time I can recall, it seemed to be timed correctly.  A
port would occur, then the announcement for 15 minutes would occur almost
immediately afterwards.
