    The Sleeper's Tomb script doesn't change the zone. This is done by hand 
the next time the server is patched or next time Sleeper's is brought down. 
The zone is never supposed to be reverted to prior state.

    Why would they delete them? If they ever wanted to revert the zone, or 
check how things used to be, it wouldn't be wise to delete the old work.

    They make spawn and drop table errors all the time. That's all "old CT" 
is - a spawn table. So instead of pointing to New_CT_Table, they pointed to 
Old_CT_Table by accident when doing one of their cut n' pastes from old 
code.
