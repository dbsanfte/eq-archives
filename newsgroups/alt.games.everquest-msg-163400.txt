Woot!  No more having to stock up, port out, break down all the bricks, and then
gate back to the top and come back down to town to get more!

I haven't seen any of these items described or offered in auction. Is any one
making them?  Are they utter crap, or is JC finally worth something other than a
little quick and dirty resist gear?

Heh, never heard this complaint... sure would have sucked

Meaning "stacks of items will no longer be treated as single items, so you no
longer waste up to 19 if you put them in by mistake?"

What does this mean?

Er, as opposed to /w all GUILD?

Helpful, but a min/max... well just min... setting for a stat would help more.
If I want Wis items, I don't mean the 400 with Wis 1 on them!  And some of those
items are very expensive for other reasons, so just jacking up the minimum price
doesn't help.

I should hope so!  Using raid before seemed to mean that NO exp was given
(well, maybe 1% over several hours)

Hope my son didn't carry thru with his threat to destroy his little erudite... I

Making Trial of Execution much more beatable?

Excellent, this was very tiresome

Hey, acknowledgement that Dwarf is NOT a small race... since I've always been
able to get out of that pool, and I don't mean by gating/dying and body
dragging/Porting/TL either.  Swimming was my only advantage (like AT, utility
skills capped out)

Wish I had a clue what that was about.
