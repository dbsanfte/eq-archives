The early versions of Zone Alarm where not like a true firwall, having
looked at it again now it seems to be much better.
But when it first came out it would only stop known attacks like a virus
checker would only stop viruses it knew.

But like I say, it now seems to be much better in that department. But like
I say Tiny Firewall is free for home use and is used by the US Navy so it
must be ok at least ;)
