I too have experienced the 5-15 min delay while my character was "active".
It is SO frustrating to be helpless to do anything about it. I think they
should do what's done in DAoC. See, alot of people would worm their way out
of pvp combat by Alt-Tabbing, as this will close the prog immediately. So
they put LDs on a 45 second timer. I think EQ should follow. If you are one
of the losers that would LD to get out of jail free, then 45 seconds is
enough to get you killed anyway. And on a pvp server if you were 45 seconds
ahead of someone who is coming after you, then you probably would have
gotten away anyway, so 45 seconds seems long enough there too. BUT more
importantly, it takes most people more than 45 seconds to get to the
character select screen, so the useless waiting is kept to a minimum, which
is how it should be. All said, I think it's a good idea.
