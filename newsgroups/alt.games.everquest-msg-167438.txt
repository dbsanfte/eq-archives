I enjoy questing ONLY if certain rules apply.

No grouping needed (or even wanted/suggested/or even "may be needed" or
"advised").  None of this "you can solo if you ____ & also ____ & also if
you ____, but don't ____, & make sure to ____, also need to ____, only if
you ____...".  I mean the chances of solo (AND SURVIVE...which by "survive"
I am referring to finishing with a 75+% chance of coming out of the
quest/battle with 40+% HP & preferably still my pet, with enough mana for
Feign Death if needed) like a LV1-5 soloing a small rat in the newbie area,
not how some of these guides are talking about you "can" solo, like 10
people "can" solo Plane of Fear, or you "can" parachute & not have it open
but live to tell about it.  I say this because of the times I'm on & able to
play, I can usually expect better chances of a LV50+ Necro (DE) walking up
to me, handing me all their gear with 10K+pp & walking away, than I can at
being able to find a group for more than a few minutes at a time (one that
will allow me to level FORWARDS).  Maybe I'm exagerating a bit, but you
should get the idea of what I mean.  This is the reason I'm playing a Necro,
because they are supposed to be best at soloing, & so far I've made it 9 LVs
farther than any other of my characters (so no higher LV alts to help me
along).

Also the other requirement is that the quest is easy to follow &
straightforward, in a realistic manner.  Too much of EQ appears to have been
written for the people who have been around & used to things since beta
testing (first phase), and also have been playing EQ about 50 hours per day,
15 days per week, 100 weeks per year, for the past 6+ years.  Then the ones
that aren't that bad are mainly for the ones who have been playing 24 hrs
per day, 7 days per week, 52 weeks per year, since spring of 1999.  I have
to be able to do things where I'm playing only 10-20 hrs per week at most
(have ocasionally had a month were I didn't play at all...just don't always
have the time).  (And I don't mind wasting the $12.95 for the month I might
not have had the chance to play because over all it isn't that much...about
$0.43 per day...most people spend far more than that on entertainment in
other areas...spending more $$ for less hours of time).

Too often it seams many people (not all, but enough to make it worth the
mentioning) make suggestions assuming that I'm a super twinked LV50+ hunting
in a < LV20 mob area with about as much experience in handling any type of
situation as someone who has been doing almost nothing but playing EQ since
it's release (suggesting I fight in an area, or a certain mob, not warning
me of the dangerous LARGE agro radious of the mobs, or chances of trains, or
strength, or countless other things that cause one to LV backwards faster
than a well equiped group with constant pulls & no downtime can LV
forwards).

I'll end this by saying that I've been playing (when I am able to) since
January 2000, and have played the following characters.

Half Elf Warrior (started in Qeynos) - LV6 (my test character...not really
serious one)
Ogre Warrior to LV16-17 (realized being that KOS & worring about faction &
either insain downtime (played in 2000) with strong EXP penalties back then,
was not good for my first serious character).
Halfling Druid to LV15 (decided to due to fast leveling, but not a twink so
was always spending pp on spells, nothing else, plus wasn't able to group
due to times I was able to play).
Iksar Shadowknight to LV12 (only because as the Druid I was given a good SK
only weapon & had just bought RoK expansion...did this in March 2001. Quit
due to not liking my choice of an extreamly large selection of a whole 2
zones to hunt in...4 total if you count the ones where mobs are spread out
so far you spend more time looking for them than I did when my Ogre Warrior
was healing up a few hundred HP.)
Barbarian Warrior to LV19 (thought the snow area would be fun to play in,
plus wanted a big race for their warrior abilities, didn't want Ogre or
Troll due to size & problems of KOS + finding large sized armor.  Again got
too hard to advance without grouping...spent insain amounts of downtime
looking for mobs).
Iksar Monk to LV12 (Again tried one which could supposably solo well...but
having played warriors so much I couldn't get used to being a monk carrying
100+ in weight...and again the whole 2 zones I could actually fight in at
this LV...Lake of Ill Omen was too common...so many people were saying to
hunt there I felt like I was following instructions or pier pressure, not
playing & enjoying myself).
Vah-Shir Beastlord to LV5 (Ran into same situation as Iksar Monk &
SK...needed to group...not much help available at that time due to SoL just
being released...and after spending a month getting to LV5, I decided
Vah-Shir wasn't the race for me.)
Gnome Wizard to LV12 (Again ran into problems of needing to group to
survive...mainly due to having to spend everything I had to buy some of my
spells & still not having enough for them all...plus was able to get lucky &
sat in a group & nearly power leveled with the ocasional standing to cast a
spell for about 5 levels in EC orc camps...then saw how expensive things
were getting & all I could think of was where to get my next pp from for
spells...then also saw how nearly all spells I had to have required
research...and the grouping problem again...time to find a way to summon a
group rather than look for them.)
Currently Dark Elf Necro at LV28. - I summon my group rather than /shout or
/ooc for them.  Group doesn't mind getting wiped out to save my @ss.  Great
attacks at my command (spell selection).  Just need the right advice & the
time to be able to follow it.  Somewhat like a warrior (the class I appear
to do best with), but also a caster so can be pretty powerful too.  Also
remembered liking being the SK with the pet.
