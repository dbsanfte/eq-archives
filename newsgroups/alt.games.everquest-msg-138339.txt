Yeap, I know how that one goes. :)

}> There's 'ex-ex-gays'?  Lol.  Were they Born Again? :)

Think I may have heard that before... I think I'm glad I still basicaly 
agree with the only organization I ever helped start.  Destroying my own 
work would be a fearsome challenge.

}> Yep.  I think some people just have a bit of trouble with that

}I foresee a lifetime of research just to find a value for "n"!

Nah, let's just estimate it at about (population of earth)^2. :)

}Then imagine all the debate over naming the "clumps" LOL.

I hereby start the movement to name my personal kink cluster "Fred". :)

}I'm sure you
}know about the "six degrees of separation" thing... I wonder how many
}degrees of separation would exist between most people under this
}n-dimentional sexual space?

Oh, that's the beauty of vector math... You subtract two vectors, you get 
another vector, so the difference between two kinks is a kink unto itself.
