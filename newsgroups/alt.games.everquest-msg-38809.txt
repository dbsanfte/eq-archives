Try playing an EQ Bard then :-0

There are many people who don't have the 'young buck' reflexes of my 13 year
old nephew.  Such a reflex-based online game penalizes 1) older gamers {who
by nature have slower reflexes}, 2) the physically handicapped gamer, 3) the
gamer without the perfect DSL, cable, or T-1 connection.

In other words, it would be hampering part of their potentiial customer
base.  RL reflexes determining every detail of your gameplay is OK if you're
young, in perfect health, and playing offline....
