Against all but the toughest mobs, yes, you mitigate as well as a
warrior. The warrior only does better against mobs necessitating a
cleric to use CH on his greater hp pool. Clerics have had their group
reliance reduced in recent patches, leaving warriors somewhat out in the
cold, along with enchanters, as situational group members.

Warriors *need* beefing up. I've been a warrior, and nothing but a
warriors, since release. This is the first era of the game I've felt
that way.

Kraiven, L60 ranger in my guild
ALL class, ALL archetype, most general - 280+ AA points at last count

Guess that kinda pisses on your 'rangers can't solo' cornflakes, since
he does pretty well in the soloing stakes ):oP
