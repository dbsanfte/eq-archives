The small manual that came with the original EQ back when it was released
has no class descriptions.  The Official Strategy Guide (sold seperately of
course) DOES.

Druid:
 -- Begin Quote --
A Druid is completely at home in the outdoors and is a friend to all
animals.  Because of this no animal will ever attack him unless first
attacked by the Druid.  They are spellcasters whose focus is all things
natural, allowing them to call upon nature for aid.  They share some
woodland skills with their Ranger brothers.

Druids are protectors of life and herbalists of no small regard.  A Druid is
an odd amalgamation of Ranger and Cleric, healers of the wounded and
protectors of the forests.  Do not underestimate the power of a Druid to
assist you in the plains and barrens of Norrath.

"At first glance the Druid doesn't look that attractive.  I mean, everything
a Druid can do, some other class can do better.  Clerics have better
defensive buffs, and healing.  Wizards have more efficient and harder
hitting Direct Damage spells, Shamans get the offensive buffs and Enchanters
get the mind blowing spells.  And lets not even try to compare an magicial
pets to Druid's.  Druid versions of all of the are generally inferior and
limited.

So why be a Druid if you're not the best at anything?  Well, a variety of
reasons.  For starters, there is one thing that Druids are better at than
anyone else:  Travelling.  Camouflage at Fifth, Spirit of the Wolf at
Fourteenth, Teleports starting at Nineteenth, and Group Teleports starting
at twenty ninth, nobody is better at going from point A to POint B than the
Druid.  We're the masters of the Outdoors, and guess where travelling
happens?  Enchanters make you wish your were dead, Bards are the life of the
party, Shamans make you feel better about yourself, Clerics are a dead man's
best friend, Magicians and Necromancers make their own friends, Wizards go
boom-boom, and druids go everywhere."

-- End Quote --

I find it significant that the original Official Strategy Guide lists Travel
as our defining ability, while the most current book doesn't list travel at
ALL.

The original stratagy guide by the way, DOES list the Wizards ability to
port, but says NOTHING about being able to port others.
