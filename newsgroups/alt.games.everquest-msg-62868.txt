And FYI:

The head programmer at EQ, the guy who is in charge of the move to
Direct X 8 etc codenamed "rowyl" (the VERY hefty guy who is not abashi
in screenshots of the verant team), was the guy who I guess cracked
the verant encryption for show EQ originally and did work on that.
Quite some time ago someone at verant like Smedly made the quip that
".. if they ever found anyone who cracked their encryption and made an
EQ emulator, they'd hire him ;) " He basically did and they basically
did. 

In a preview of velious where a game website toured verant Smedly
pointed out that was where Rowyl had come from.

So basically, what I'm saying is that the head of programming guy who
is doing the dx8 move and came up with the new velious GUI etc is joe
hacker programmer. So pretty much anything people think they could
possibly due to gain an advantage he'd likely know about and they'd
plug. He is about the best thing to happen to EQ.
