    I think I may have a way around the moron GM. Details below.

    So the level 68, loot-bearing mobs are triggered spawns. The fucknut has
no right to engage them unless you wipe (you have logs showing you won),
leave (if you leave the event you lose, and you won, so no go there), or
unless he triggered them. To do that, he would have had to kill a bunch of
level 65 mobs while kiting twice that many level 65 mobs from the other two
rooms, and then kill the level 68 triggered mob. Even the biggest retard GM
in EQ will see that is not possible. Killing a single level 68? Yeah, I bet
you could drop him with a charmed pet and some luck. Killing six 65's while
kiting 12 others (and you have to get to the other rooms FAST), THEN killing
a 68? Um, no.

    People are usually running back to room one to get flags, too. The
loot-bearing mobs die in rooms two and three, so unless someone is left
behind to lock the corpse you will leave them vulnerable. And don't you dare
tell me you number the rooms any other way! Room one is the flag room, it
can be called no other number! ;-)

    See my reasoning above. To succeed in the trial (as you did and can
prove), that mob had to die. If someone else killed that mob, they either
stole a triggered spawn from you which is petitionable, or they did the
entire event solo which is clearly absurd.

    Well, three rooms isn't THAT tough. Our overnight Australian guild could
kill it, I bet. It would be tough for a smaller guild to do, though, I will
admit that.

    I asked for that twice, and never got it. :-(

    I'm disappointed that people like this play EQ. But as long as they get
rewarded for it, they'll keep doing it. On our flame boards recently, one
person complained about his group being trained out on purpose by a member
of guild A. Guild A apparently had a group nearby, one that wanted to pull
more mobs, so according to the poster his group was trained to allow the
guild A group to pull more. Pretty standard flame board fare, maybe the
guild A person was on CR or was trying to pull past the wiped group, even
with screenshots it could go either way. But let me quote one of the guild A
members that posted to the thread early on, names edited out:

"and your 100% right...personally I don't even know who the hell X [the
trainer - James] is....I was MIA from guild A for a bout a month and a half
and he was invited in that time frame...since ive been back playing a bit
(the past week or so) ive never really spoken to him....so honestly...as
long as my friends are at the raids, and as long as we have fun and kill
shit, or have fun and don't kill shit....I could care less what X or anyone
else does....its not my problem....

I'm tagged in guild A because I have about a handful of friends that are
tagged in guild A. I like guild A's leadership and we have a damn good time
making stuff dead....its not a club, or a brotherhood, or fraternity...we
raid, and when we don't raid, its each individuals own time to do what he or
she wants, if that is training people purposely, then so be it...let the
people that get paid to deal with that shit deal with it.......if the
leadership spent every off hour they had online trying to resolve dumbass
disputes (no I don't think you are a dumbass for being mad, but I think X I
a dumbass for doing what he did) such as this, you think they would be
around long? absolutely not...I know I wouldn't, why the hell would I wanna
police a buncha kids (or adults) in a video game, I play to raid, and to
laugh and relax with my friends....period...this game isn't anyone's
job....except for the gm's, guides, etc....

So bottom line is...don't label a guild tag because of an incident with 1 or
2 or 10 members....because honestly, the majority probably don't even really
know said members...

Secondly, if you have a problem with anyone in this game doing something to
hinder your game play, take it up with the proper authorities, or shut
up....."

    I couldn't even flame that, I was so stunned that someone would say it.
"It doesn't matter how cruddy the people are I'm guilded with, and don't you
dare call me cruddy because I help support them by raiding with them. Go
petition a GM and STFU." Do people want the rewards in EQ so badly that
they'll put up with anyone and anything to get them? Doesn't the word
"reputation" mean anything to these people? I must be getting old or
something.
