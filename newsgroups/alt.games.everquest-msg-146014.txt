Bah, stupid piece of crap newsreader.

Here's the text that should have been in the previous message.

Really, all you have to do to make the bazaar very smooth is switch to the
overhead view.  I keep all my settings maxed out, I run at 1280x1024.  I
switch to overhead view before zoning in, and have no problems at all.
Admittedly, navigating is a bit of a bitch, but I know where the banks are,
and I can navigate to traders using the right click on their names, and
running around obstacles.  Worked great with my old GeForce2 MX400.
