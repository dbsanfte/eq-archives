It depends from class to class, shamans are the best buffers for light melee
classes: stats buffs, haste (rogues, monks, rangers, beastmasters), cleric
are best for tanks: HP/AC buffs (warriors, paladins, shadowknights), and
enchanters are best buffers for all casters clarity, INT/WIS buffs.

Well, thats my opinion, feel free to say what you think of it.
