There is no doubt that they are putting the "give back" in to
eventually get rid of multiquesting, a blantant and outright exploit
of the quest engine.  I have multiquested with the best of them,
mostly for darkforge armour and the no drop cleric armour from temple
of ro.

multiquesting velious armour and epic stuff was the biggest slap in
the face to the Vision.  Of course, some epic encounters will still be
multiquestable. the ones where you turn in an item to spawn a mob.
