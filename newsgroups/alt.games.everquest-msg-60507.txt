Riiight. So, I should buy a second computer, get a second phoneline,
buy a second account and PL a porting mule to higher level than my
current secondary, in order to port my _druid_ main around? 

(See that word 'wanderer' in my sig? It's the same as a heirophant,
only a few levels lower)

(Oh, and my alts won't need taxi mules either, thankyouverymuch)

As it is, I am bound at Sebilis. I could go there and /lfg for an
hour, or I could get an existing Velk group or scrounge up some melees
and start a floor group and get my 2 blues of exp for a night and some
crystalline silk for my tailoring to boot. My groups might not be able
to grab every spawn within reach, but so what? And if I can't get
anyone to hunt with at all, there's always the option of running
outside and killing a shardwurm before heading back in to /lfg again.

Clearly, we have different ideas of what constitutes a waste of time
and I am just wondering why you took your precious, taxi equipped
ubergeared warrior to that stupid hellhole of slow exp in the first
place, much less why you didn't leave the second you couldn't find a
good fast group. How long did it take you to get the accidental
efficient exp grind that kept you there?

Yes, we know you're the uberest of uber and all that, but if you
preach about how lame we lowly grunts are for flocking to zones like
Velks and then hunt there yourself, you just sound full of shit.
