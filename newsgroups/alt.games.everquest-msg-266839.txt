The graphics lag is killing me.  EQ2 is, by far, the worst performing game I 
have ever had installed on my current rig.  Its a dog, I mean a D O G.  Even 
going to extreme performance doesnt help, the game is just sluggish. 
Especially when I am in Freeport or in combat.  It really makes enjoying the 
game impossible for me at this point.

I have tried everything I can think of to resolve the problem short of a 
format and reinstall.  Nothing works, nothing has even made a dent.  Looking 
on the official tech boards and I see some other people having similar 
problems, but also lots of people saying the game runs ok for them.
