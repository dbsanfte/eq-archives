I would say it is the former. I can easily die 2-3 times a night
fiegn-pulling the 55+ mobs in Kael if FD fails (which it does all to
often even with a skill of 193). Mobs just hit too hard post 50. Death
just becomes another part of the job.

The post-50 game is not for everyone. Personally I have recently
decided that I am not that fond of it myself. EQ becomes a lot more
like "work", due to the required time and organization it takes to
raid (even casually). The game doesn't play any differently (unless
you count tactics such as Chain-CHeal), it just takes a heck of a lot
longer to get anything done. It's funny. I can get more excitement and
satisfaction splitting a tough spawn at level 10 in untwinked crap
gear than I do after raiding for 2-3 hours in places like Seb or Kael.

To answer your question, I think that anyone who has played for more
than a year, and/or at levels 50+ is not worried about dieing. They
just accept it as part of the game.
