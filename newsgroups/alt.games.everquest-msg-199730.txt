Heh, I owe a major /blush for forgetting that 13 second recast time.  :)
Too much twoboxing with my chanter; sue me.  For the record, Sunstrike also
has a hellish recast time.

Draughts aren't more efficient, imho; it's just faster.  Efficiency lets you
do it more often - but all the efficiency in the world doesn't help if the
group dies.  Mages in the 60-plus game are where the mana efficiency is (for
nukers).  Mages do more with less, wizards do it NOW.

I've been leaving focus items out of the equation, because I usually have
'em from a high-level mage and they are ID4.  Thus, they balance out.  It's
easy enough to log on the chanter, trade a KEI for a set of foci, and drop
'em on the wizard - two accounts.  Were I to be persnickety, I'd count in my
crits from SCF2, and we could calculate the probability of the
smaller-but-more-often crits vs. the larger-but-less-often crits.  On the
occasions I don't have foci, I do have a ID3 spider fur hat - and use ISOS
and Draught of Ice, my pre-60 favorites.

I am curious about your math in one spot.  You state that by swapping
spells, I could do 43000 damage in the same time.  You lost me there.  Using
a click-toy to reset spell gems doesn't work any more - damn that 'recast
time not yet' message- so since Draught of Ro's recast time is the same time
as spell gem reset, firing a ISOS in between doesn't speed things up.  I can
hammer them out as fast as I like.  Can you explain your logic to me,
please?
