You will be lucky if you can find standalone expansions in the UK other
than PoP at the moment.

Velious I got told was deleted from the UK catalogur when I tried to buy
it in mid 2001, I eventually got it in Singapore - I havent seen a Luclin
standalone for ahile either....they seem to favour the collections very
much after a few months.

You could try gameplay.co.uk as an option, other than that its the high
street and see if they can order it.
