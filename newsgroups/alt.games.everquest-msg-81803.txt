Well, aren't you a cute little multitasker, Johnnie. Not only a
belligerent tone, but a virtually meaningless sentence. Congratulations
on surpassing even your prior serious failings.  The subject was biology
and an interpretation of it. Fitch ranted and swaggered and spluttered,
much as you do, to teh same effect, I might add. He didn't present a
case any more coherently than you do and that's just a shame and a waste
of good electrons.

Fitch was very busily embarrassing himself when - lookie - here comes
Daddio/JPD/Jervis to his rescue by doing his normal deflection and
diversion. Shame you didn't actually address the content of the posts
rather than doing your one-trick-pony, hipster, mr. cool act. But then
you'd give everybody one more thing to laugh at, wouldn't you.

So here it is, Johnnie Mop, Fitch has no credentials to talk about the
subject beyond his fevered beliefs and over-the-top expressions. By
contrast, Billo has actually read a book or two about human biology in
getting an MD. See how it works?  No, I didn't think so.

Yes, adn it's demonstrably clear to any but the most obtuse chuzzlewit,
and you. But I repeat myself...

You need  to start a company called "Irrelevant Bullshit "R" Us" adn do
it soon. Billo and I have agreed on some subjects and disagreed on
others. He ain't a priest any more than I am. But I can recognize
positions based on something more than perspiration flowing down a
frantic forehead. He knows what he's talking about and Fitch doesn't;
simple, no? Even you should understand that, but I have small hope for
that.

Honesty and education are more red herrings for you to scatter behind
you as you flee for teh comfortable refuge of the illiterate, teh
unintelligent and the utterly baffled. I recommend you to be the
ambassador for all those benighted groups to teh rest of the world.

Perhaps you should invest in a spell checker. Then a content checker...

And perhaps you should try to formulate sentences that actually have
enough content to forestall teh snickers and amused pot shots you get
when you post.

This demolition is your signal to post more of your sloppy vulgarity and
hilarious name-calling. You ought to get some high school kid to teach
you how to use bad language. You don't quite have it down. Comes out
more gracelessly funny than insulting. Well you can't have everything,
right Johnnie? OTOH, *one* skill would be nice, don't you think?

I have to go to the Johnnie now. Later.
