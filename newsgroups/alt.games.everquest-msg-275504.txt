The main benefit for traders, now that lots of stuff is attunable, is
that they'll no longer be passing it onto alts and guildmates when
they outgrow it, so you should have an increased demand for armour.

And the nested boxes/bags thing means you can now sell large numbers
of boxes at a time, as opposed to however many you have room for in
your main Inv slots.  Of course, I can only carry 1 or 2 at a time, so
there's still lots of back and forth from the crafthall and bank...

They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
Bunnies !  Bunnies !  It must be BUNNIES !
