Because they aren't large race, and the axe is large
race only.  My question was... what if you Charm
(better, Dire Charm) a large race mob?  Heck,
if it won't work with giants, how about an actual
member of one of the races listed?  Get an Ogre
Bouncer to help you hunt the lizards outside CT
or something, just for proof of concept.  If that
works, try something more interesting, like Oowlump
(or whatever his name is) coming down to help
hunt Raptors :)
