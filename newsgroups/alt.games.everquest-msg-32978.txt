New would be an apt description, Ive put one practice point into
Brewing, and that is it so far.
 /em Grin
The main reason I am doing the brewing is for a few quests I have to
do and I need to do the brewing myself due to no drop items.

Which city has the best setup to do brewing in?
What is the most economical for begining brewer?
What seems to be the tanks favorite brew? (within reason for a young
brewer)  My wifes character is a brewer and she gave me a stack of
Timjuins something brew?   I shared it with all the warriors in
group...  Lots of fun was had.

If you could guide me to any  good guides on the subject I would be
most greatfull.
I did try eq-traders but the guides there were extreamly sparse.

Thanks
