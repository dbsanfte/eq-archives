No one knows the exact formula because Verant has repeatedly refused to release
it. (I suspect THEY don't know the formula, but that is a different rant.)

It appears that the formula is based on (in no particular order):

* damage rating of the weapon
* proficiency in the weapons class (1HB, piercing,etc)
* ATK skill
* AC of the target
* STR (possibly secondary, as changes in strength automatically change ATK.)

Back when she was 8th level, by halfling druid was gifted with a nice 1HB that
did 9 dmg. By the time she maxed her proficiency (about a level latter), she was
doing about 1.5 x the listed dmg. By 11th and since, she routinely does 2 x
damage. At 25th level, she might, when lucky, hit for 19. The chance of hitting
for max damage is definitely related to the level of the mob she is attacking; I
assume that it is a function of my ATK vs. mob's AC and not directly based on
level, as is (for what it is worth) whether the mob is fighting or fleeing
(fleeing mobs seem harder to hit, but take much more damage.)

Just based on observation.
