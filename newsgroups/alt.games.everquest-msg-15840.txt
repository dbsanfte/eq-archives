>Besides that, how does more twinks and alts affect your game? 

They don't affect my game. I twink my alts all the time. I have no
beef with twinks. I mentioned it more as a symptom than a problem. It
is a sign that the economy on my server is completely glutted with
items. A certain flavor of uniqueness is missing. Why quest for
something when it is being auctioned at wholesale prices in EC? I even
find myself doing just that. Epic weapons just aren't that epic when
you see several  in the same evening of adventuring.

I agree completely. There will always be players that play 24/7 and
max out thier levels. On the older servers that have never split, the
average level of the population is steadily rising (even the slow
pokes like me are hitting the higher levels after 2 years without a
split).  The high level hunting zones are saturated much more heavily
than on a younger server where the level ranges are more evenly
distributed.

>mentioned earlier. 

Heheh maybe, but on a new "Green" server, it will take a few months
before the grass is completely trampled by the stampede of players :)

Cheers
