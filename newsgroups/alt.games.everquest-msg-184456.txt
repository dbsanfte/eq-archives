Come on people.   Lighten up a bit.

This frog was created by a long-time hard core player who is also a member
of Xev's resident uber guild.   Most of his guild never even knew he was
doing this project.  The fact is, this player and his guild could care less
if this frog has skills or not.  They could park it in some far corner of
the Planes and just leave it as a rezbot if they wanted.

I celebrate the fact he was able to hit 65 and be epiced in 50 hours 4
minutes played.   It compares to most of the other stunts people do to get
in Guiness for example.

Nuff said :-)
