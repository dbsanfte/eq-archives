Just FYI on that DS potion.  I have not tested the better of the two, have
read that it doesn't actually work better than the easier one, don't know.
It is fire based damage, it causes (Level/4)+1 damage, and lasts for Level/4
minutes.  So, it stacks with druid/ranger DS, which is nice, but it's
efficacy is directly related to the level of the user.
