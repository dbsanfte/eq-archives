True. However, maybe he did look and just couldn't find the answers, and
turned to the newsgroup for help.    I thought that was the purpose of
newsgroups, to share information.  I learn a lot of stuff by reading this
newsgroup, and 95 percent of the posters are nice, helpful, and more patient
than they have to be.  It's those posters that keep me coming back.  The
other five percent, well, I won't go there, risking a flaming.  But I also
want to use this chance, after lurking for over a year now, to thank those
posters that have made the game a lot more enjoyable!
