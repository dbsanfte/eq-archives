Actually I'm just tired of the media telling me who I'm supposed to be
crying over this week.

Thousands of people die all over the world every day. Heck, rumour has it I
may die someday!

Are the lives of 7 US astronauts more important than the family of 7 on
their way to Disneyland in an SUV that tipped over?

What I was trying to say was, IMHO if you had told any of those astronauts
that someday they would die in a Shuttle accident, would they say 'Oh
Really? Then screw this gig, I'm going to be an accountant at H&R Block."

Somehow I doubt it.

Anyway - you folks let Larry King tell you how to feel. I'll mourn for those
I know and love.
