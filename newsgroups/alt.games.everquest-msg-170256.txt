Didn't mean it as a complaint, simply an observation.  Although... while I
have no problem with gay people, I have several gay friends myself, I don't
particularly like flamers in the same way I don't like whores -- they make a
point of flaunting their sexuality to the point that it's just damn annoying
sometimes.

Ian McKellan is gay?  I mean, I know he was in a movie where he played a gay
writer but I didn't know he actually *was* gay.
