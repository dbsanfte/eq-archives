When I read that they were considering the solo LDoN's, my jaw dropped.
Everything I had read from those guys on the various class boards had
indicated that they were committed to making this a game for grouping and
raiding and not soloing.  I guess it was a case of a company developing a
software program in accordance with their own vision instead of the desires
of the customers (or at least a sizable segment of customers).   I don't
even need a soloable LDoN, just something so that if myself and a couple of
friends are on and the group consists of a mage, pally, and ranger, we can
do an LDoN without having to find a healer and a slower.  There were nights
when they just were not to be found.
