I have been playing on and off for 2.5 years and i have pretty much explored
everything that is relatively safe to a ranger under 40 (Now that i think of
it, that sounds a bit ridiculous ;P). Anyway... Best money places i have
found this far:

1. Wisp island in eruds crossing on the way to Odus from Freeport. There are
lot of Willowisps so you can make pretty platinum from looting lightstones.
This applies to anywhere above lvl 9. (Melee types should wait a bit longer
to be able to solo wisps).

2. Everfrost: Mammoth tusks. These drop off wooly mammoths and should be
soloable at 23-25 if i recall correctly. Really nice for a ranger at maybe
even lower because you get panic animal so you can fear kite them :) I think
atleast wooly spiders are place holders for mammoths, so kill those aswell
when you see them. (? anyone ?)

3. Rathe mountains: Giants. Everyone know hill giants drop really good plat
:) And this place is swarming those. Note, the smaller crap around giant
place of the zone is place holders for giants, so if you dont have giant to
pull, pull anything :) (giant skels, lizzies, cyclops, whatever)


So, thats my two cents. I'm at work so can't check my notes for rumours i
have heard during my explorations for higher lvl money, but prolly you will
be  sitting your arse sore at some low level dungeon and camp crap to sell
in bazaar :)
