You can dl the trilogy, but not Luclin.  At least I couldn't a few months
back.  The patcher tells you the download is too big.

Looking at the POP box in the store, I believe it comes with the trilogy, so
if you're coming back to the game, I'd just buy that and skip the download.

Still leaves the luclin problem, though.
