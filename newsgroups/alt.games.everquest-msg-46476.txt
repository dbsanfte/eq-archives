Whatever the case, there are some people (not saying that your father is one
of these types) who will exploit a situation, exaggerate it, turn it inside
out, in order to gain a nice bit of cash.

And although I think Americans in general have handled this bombing very
well and courageously, there are some who are wont to use this tragedy as a
springboard to their own financial gains, at the expense of those affected
by the tragedy.  It happens all the time, and is an unfortunate occurrence
whenever it does happen, which is often enough.
