No, doesn't surprise me.
All they need do for 2hb is give it the 2hs animation, they can't be too
worried about staff type weapons disapearing into the model, watch someone
swing a Stone Bladed Axe of Dismay or Savage War Axe and you'll see what I
mean.

It'd be nice if there was a proper one, My Barb Shaman on the character
screen looks awesome swinging her Spiritist Hammer over head in both hands,
come game time and it's lamely thrust, one handed, at the direction of the
target :�/ Mind you, it's proc is anything but lame :�)

Just hope they make more of an effort for EQ2, assuming EQ2 is worth it's
salt and is not just a diluted EQ. Oh and I hope they START with RP server
as an option, because that'll be where I'm heading :�)
