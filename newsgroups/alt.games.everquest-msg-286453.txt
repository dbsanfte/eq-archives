I use F8 to reset the target cycle to the closest mob.  It's fairly often that
I'm keeping some mobs mezzed, and there are more in line of sight that aren't
aggro but still take too long to cycle through to get back to one that needs
my attention.

Thinking about it, I could perhaps just use escape or f1 to break the cycle,
and then cycle target would go to the nearest, regardless of what was
previously targetted.

So, yes, I can think of a reason not to do that, but it's a wrong reason :)
