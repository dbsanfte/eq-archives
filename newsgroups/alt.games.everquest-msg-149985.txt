I, on the other hand, will let them die.  Just like everyone else who
isn't playing a "raid will die if he does" role.  IF its convenient I'll heal
them, sure... but they aren't priority.

Its the pet.  Pet hits add to the hate listing of the pet owner.  So your
magician is constantly stepping up and up the hate list, while the wizard
is only occaisionally pounding out a single blast.  If the mage is blasting
at the same rate, he's much higher on the list than the wizard.

If a mage is getting eaten and the enchanter is also getting eaten, who
do you heal?  How about if the MT is getting down into CHeal range,
do you heal the mage?  Lets say the puller is FD and dying of a DOT,
but the mage has mobs on him, who do you heal now?

Let the mage die unless healing him is convienient... or unless you
are facing a mob that can only be killed by mage pets or the mage
as a mana source is so critical to success that you'd rather lose an
MA and go to SA, or chanter get replaced by backup mezer, or...
well healing the puller really isnt' important often either, I did try to
make a case for it though.

Is that the horse from the drop only bridle, or the 100Kpp vendor
buyable one?
