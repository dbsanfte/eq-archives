Before you go getting all huffy, don't mistake my normal dry sense of
humor as an attack simply because it's directed at you. I would hope by
now that you'd know that I respect you as a writer and a contributor to
this group and quite enjoy reading your posts. You've just hit on a pet
peeve of mine here, and are in a situation where I clearly think you are
wrong. I ahve contradicted your points, one by one. That fact that you
don't agree with my contradictions of them does not make them non
extant.

You're xp-saving theory for a lower level player is crap, Lance, sorry.
The difference in numbers over any normal length camp would be
measurable in math, but not noticable in terms of visual indications on
the xp bar. And it's more than made up for the danger you present to the
group through potential level aggro in many parts of PoP, (for example,
castle in PoD where I was yesterday, and when we had a fifty join us we
were suddenly getting swarmed) and the lack of contribution to the group
compared to them waiting for somebody of appropriate level who could
pull their fair share of the load.

As I said in the beginning... if you have a group of friends who are
willing to take you there and essentially PL you, then great! They are
your friends and it's their group. Just don't get disappointed if you
try to get into pickup groups on this theory and nobody takes your, or
problems ensue. That's all I'm saying.

I also never said you couldn't contribute *anything*, as you seem to be
clinging to that notion. However the fact that your contibutions are
very modest compared to somebody of appropriate level for the area, and
don't (IMHO) compensate for the potential downsides of dragging an under
leveled character in with you.
