Hit some dungeons.  Sol A, Cazic, Dalnir's, they're all good for your
level, drop lots of cash and fine steel, and have pretty decent drops.
Heck, there's probably some stuff in Dalnir's that you'd like to keep
for yourself.

If you want to stay outdoors, East Wastes and Iceclad has some nice,
if very rare loot, Giants in Frontier Mountians, Firona Vie, and
Warliks Woods are allways good, and you might even be able to start
looking for Hill Giant groups in the Rathe Mountians.

Failing all that, you can allways slum it out at a bandit camp or
three.
