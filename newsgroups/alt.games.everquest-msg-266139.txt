I play GMT +10:00 hours (Brisbane Australia).

I have heard the Aussie release date is 11 Nov so won't know what server I 
will be on till the weekend. I have always liked blackburrow so unless it's 
packed with gravitate towards it I guess unless a compelling reason for 
another server crops up.

I don't have much time for gaming anymore though so will only be a very 
casual gamer. Damn webmastering eats up too much time.
