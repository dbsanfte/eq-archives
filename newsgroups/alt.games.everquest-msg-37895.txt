Can you point us to some evidence of the above? Not flaming you,
honestly, I'm just really curious. AFAIK, the EQ player base is still
growing, and if you are talking about old-timers in your guild leaving
and then extrapolating to EQ as a whole. well, that kind of attrition in
a game that's over two years old is only to be expected, that's why
Verant are developing other games. I'm sure they don't expect people to
play EQ until they die of old age.
