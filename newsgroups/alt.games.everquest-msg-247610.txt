Sorry for the delay but I've been away for a few days.

Granted, this attitude is there a lot. But if you find a person which is
doing a fairly well job *and* is willing to learn then you have a damn
good player imho.

The moment this group stands against such an overpull is when they get
their real experience. And I don't mean for their chars but for their
playing skills.

I hardly disagree. But it's better than having outdoor single pull
groups only.

It was before LDoN. But even in LDoNs it is a way to stand against
multiple mobs. No chance in hell an enchanter - untwinked of course -
stands against 2 or more mobs trying to channel 2+ mezzes through. He
probably will lock down the first but doesn't have the HP/AC to channel
the second. One stun would help there. ;)

I'm not so sure a agree with you there. You may have a point but a
regular dungeon crawl has a lot in common with LDoN. In a crawl you
usually don't deal with respawn unless you are stuck within an area for
some reason. The only difference I see is pulling. In LDoN I like to
have rather long pullways. Being a bard I need this to control my pulls.
I'm talking about hard LDoNs btw. Normal is just no challenge any more.
In a 'normal' dungeon I would stick closer to my group and would move
more frequently because of respawn.

But they have to watch one target *only*. I didn't say a cleric or any
other char could catch up almost instantly. But I do say it requires far
more skill to survive a dire situation as a group than keep standing
against one mob.

This is a problem I don't blame LDoN on. Rather I would say making
pacify that powerful just made enchanters dispensable. Just put KEI on
tribut masters and you only need enchanters for certain raid encounters.
Granted they can be the best dps class in game with charm. But that's
another story and definitly not their defining ability imho. A group in
a dungeon with a hasted charmpet and no other reliable crowd control is
asking for trouble. Or they have means to circumvent Murphy's Law which
isn't very likely. :)
