Are you running a custom UI at all?

Old system ... could be a problem.  Interestingly SOE are continually
sneaking in stealth fixes for the DX9 engine.  You may have noticed
that they replaced the DX9.dll file with the last patch.  This was not
announced anywhere in the patch message.

DX9 is the future for all games so those of us that are gamers will
have to roll with this.  If you really want to see your system bought
to its' knees try the Demo of the game Far Cry which is the closest
implementation of DX9 features yet.
