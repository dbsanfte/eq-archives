I think I was a little hasty with my original post. After posting it I
went back for another go and managed to make a decent 6 slot backpack,
so I finally got somewhere.

I think though that a lot of newbie crafters are going to be put off
like I was. As you say above about the buffs, I didn't know anything
about them and at the start just let it go through and took damage and
thought that was how the system worked. They hold you hand in a lot of
other areas in the game but crafting seemed to miss out on being user
friendly.

Cheers,
