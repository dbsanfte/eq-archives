FWIW, I only have focus effects work on item procs that are spells I can
cast.  So, for example, my ID4 ring does not magnify the proc on my staff
(lightening surge), but if I had a proc of, say, Calefaction, it would
modify it.  (The second part is not personally confirmed, but just what
I've read on the Ranger's Glade.)

Since warriors do not have any of their own spells, I would guess that
focus effects would do them little good.
