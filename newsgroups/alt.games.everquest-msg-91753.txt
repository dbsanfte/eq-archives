Maybe one person posted in error, however, every EQ info site will
tell you that it's not until level 6 that corpses start lasting longer
than 30 mins...

As for your loss, yup, as others have said, neither VI nor the
GMs/guides are responsible for losses due to connection loss. The only
time they'll reimburse for LD issues is when massive numbers go LD at
once, and then it's only rezzes for deaths caused by it. Other times,
it's most likely your ISP or system that's behind the LD, or a router
somewhere along the line. VI cannot be expected to take responsibility
for that...
