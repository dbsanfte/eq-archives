If that is the case then that's poor coding. On any FPS game a player can
*run* the same speed as any other, regardless of their Frame Per Second. The
person on the slower PC will have a jerkier picture but you will move the
same speed. Even one on Cable and another on Modem will move at the same
speed, the guy on the modem will appear much jerkier to any onlooker to the
point of warping there. but, I can well believe it is the case...hmmm I
guess I need to get another Vid card for it (KyroII 64mb atm) but that'll
have to wait as I have just found out I need a new ECU for my car which is
gonna be �300 + Vat and labour and they haven't checked the ABS yet :�(
