Nah, the only concern here  is: Does each realm have a shot at the
item in equal quantities. If you were to give this Uber sword to a
level 30 he would still be killed by a level 50. Also the uber sword
would wear out over time like any other item (weapons wear out really
fast) and become useless.

Few points.
First. Severely disadvantaged? Hmmm not sure about that. Numbers and
Levels mean more so far then items since all skills are capped at 50
as well. I am planning a nightshade for example and already have a
list of quest equipment that includes 6-10 skill points in stealth. So
I can build my Shade around a stealth skill of 40 and use those items
to max the skill. I cannot ever however go above 50 in the skill or
any other. 
Second. Your tacitly assuming this item would be restricted to uber
guilds. If it was put in it would be available to all three realms and
would theoretically appear in equal numbers on all three sides. 
Third. Uber Weapons would wear out fast just like all weapons do. 
Fourth. The level system means that even a Uber sword swung by a
meleer at a person a few levels above him is going to whiff most of
the time.

Perhaps they will do so but that would be a problem. Some classes are
inherently better at securing realm points then others, (My Bard is a
support class for instance versus say an AOE casting Wizard from
Albion). If they did reward uber weapons as a result of realm points
then the very uberguildness of EQ would appear in DAoC as the
uberguilds got the most points, thus got better equipment, thus got
even more realm points (relative to others) etc in a big endless
cycle. At least this way the requirement is that the weapons come from
PVE and are thus not tied to realm points.
