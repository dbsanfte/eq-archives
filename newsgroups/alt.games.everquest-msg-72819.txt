I think they are as we're not in real world here but one divided up
in classes (or do you think a druid would not be able to wear
plate armour in reality? I doubt some godly force prevents you from
picking up a large piece of metal and don it to your body). I just
think either shamen or druids excel at heal or regrowth, if that's
what you wondered about. As for my example spell: I think shamen
got the spells of the named combo earlier and thus are the 'owner'
of the spells and should get the combos, as they are heavy on
combos later anyway.
