You can only use the sneak attack line at the start of a fight - you need to
be agro free to hide (if you have any agro, you will just evade).  That
means if there's a multi-mob pull, you can only sneak attack on the first
one.

No need for a macro... just get into the habit of hitting sneak and hide
after a mob dies... so you'll be hidden and ready when the next mob gets
there.  Once it does, get behind it, hit sneak attack, then backstab and
evade/autoattack.
