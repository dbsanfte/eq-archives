   With Everquest 2 coming out in Winter of 2003 and Star Wars
Galaxies release date looks like it will be in the Fall somtime. I for
one will stick with Everquest #1 I don't think my system can handle
either of those games. And in Everquest I am up to level 32 which is
pretty cool it only took 4 months to get there. and I am looking
forward to level 65. People may complain about the patch's but atleast
they are always trying to improve the game.  And it's great they have
announced a new Expansion for Everquest with dungeon crawling. The
world keeps Expanding. I've enjoyed Everquest and I do not plan to
Quit anytime soon.  Even though lately I have gotten hooked on The
Sims online.  Anyway thats just my 2 cents no real point :)
