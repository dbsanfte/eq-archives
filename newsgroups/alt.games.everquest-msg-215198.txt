Well - aside from the marketing and sales issues I think that they would
prefer
a slow roll out with customer being added over time so they can scale up
their
services as required. And adding geographical areas one at a time seems a
sensible way to do this.

Of course as I'm in the UK I'm rather they did it another way but I kind of
makes
sense.
