I didnt say "some",there are lot of those requests.

Would be much more convenient for buyers AND sellers if
people name the price for the stuff they want to sell,so why
dont they do it?

Maybe I was not clear,I quote from my other post:

"Whats different is ,that the game mechanics in UO allow
players easier than in EQ to ruin others fun."

Given the same possibilities as in UO,how do you
think would all those beggars,liars,griefers and
scammers behave in EQ ?

And do you think the person behind the name "Peadarasta"
is any better than your 12 year old gang raper in EQ?
