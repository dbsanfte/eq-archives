Because Ogres have had cultural armor in the game for some time, which
could be of use to actually wear for the less than uber, sell for the
cash-strapped, or just skill up for the "addicted to tradeskills".
Trolls have a useless cultural forge sitting in Grobb with no known
purpose. Far less incentive to smith than the ogres, IMO.
