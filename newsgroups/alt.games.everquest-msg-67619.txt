Sounds to me like you registered your account for Luclin,
but didn't actually install the CD.  So it's trying to
download all the "missing" Luclin zones (all several hundred 
megabytes) via modem.

Either that, or you've launched everquest.com from a directory
other than your actual everquest directory, and it can't
find the EQ data files and (as above) is trying to download them
all.

Let it patch a file or two, notice one of the filenames,
and then do a Start/Search/Files-folders from Windows and
look for that filename.  If you find it in two different
places, that's your problem.
