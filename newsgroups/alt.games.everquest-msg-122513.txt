Most of you "old folks" will know the tune, from "The Sound of Music"...


Link-death and kill-stealers, ninjas and training,
Where is that zone line? why must it be raining?
The cleric was A-F-K, why did you pull?
Nobody told me, don't give me that bull!

When bad lag hits,
With three adds, its
Time to train the zone.

The server is coming down, no E-T-A,
So find a safe place...  and camp
