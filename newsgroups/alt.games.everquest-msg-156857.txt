Damn noobs in uber guilds :p

Note I said position trak with DA (and hopefully absorb the trak touch)
before the warrior goes in.
For us it doesnt matter who has agro, most the guild melees are at least
5.5khp.. but for some guilds its quite likely only their warrior has the HP
and AC to tank a dragon hitting for 5-700
