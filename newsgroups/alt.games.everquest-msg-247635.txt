I second that.  Lich (49) is better mana regen than KEI.  Past 49, ALWAYS
use your lich line.  Beast crack and Po9 is a nice add on, but I never
bothered getting outside buffs that often.

If you can get ahold of Demi-lich at 56, it will blow your mind (30mana per
tick)... otherwise level through to 60 for Arch Lich (34 mana/tick).... and
then Seduction of Saryrn at level 64 (50 mana per tick)!

When you get Saryrn's Kiss at level 62, you will be using that for damage
(200hp per tick dot, with 120 or so healing per tick to you, for 60
seconds), and your hp loss worries will be over ;)
