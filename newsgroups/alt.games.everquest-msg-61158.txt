Hmmm, well, if we're racing across Qeynos Hills I guess Spirit of
Cheetah might be useful, but 45 seconds isn't going to get you very
far, and Scale of Wolf seems to max out at about the same speed boost
as Selos without the drum, 65-70% faster than regular running.  Of
course when you're used to running 175% faster than normal, teleports
sometimes take too long.  All that being said, I have finally trained
my druids to just give me sow without the mock shock.  I'm lazy, I'm
already twisting three songs, and we're going into a dungeon.
