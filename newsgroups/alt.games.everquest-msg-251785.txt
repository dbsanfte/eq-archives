I'm in a guild with a lot of clerics so the Prayer Shawls are a common
quest that people go through. What I see as the major problem is that
people don't work on their tradeskills *until* they decide they're
ready to do the shawls. IIRC, when I was in my late 30's, early 40's,
I had all of my tradeskills to at least 100 and the majority in the
late 100's. There are enough combines to do to take you to 100+ easily
in most of the skills and cheaply enough that it's possible to have
a large part of the work done by the time you're ready for the shawls.
Instead, people wait until they're ready to do the entire shawl series
and then do their tradeskills. Leading to weeks of doing nothing but
farming and skilling up. Boring. :)
