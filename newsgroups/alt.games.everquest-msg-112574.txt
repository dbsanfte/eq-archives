  Ah.  Well, along with it being a limit on the number of characters you can
roleplay, it also puts a limit on the number of people who'd come to the
server for the typical twink experience.  If the limit was raised, there
would've been a bunch of people coming in from other servers with little or
no intention of roleplaying, but instead with the intention of playing EQ as
usual, twinking the hell out of their characters (made all the easier by the
lack of NO DROP items on the server.)

  The number of "roleplayers per capita" would've suffered a steep decline
with the lifting of the character limit.

  I'd like the option to start up a situational RP character every now and
then too, or would like to have the option to start up another character,
but I think that if they lifted the 1 character limit on FV, within a matter
of months it would be almost indistinguishable from a normal server, and I
don't think that's something most RPers on the servers want.
