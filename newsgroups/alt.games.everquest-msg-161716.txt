2 weeks of being a Hierophant, AA - run3 regen3 SCM1, and I'm already
insane.

All that rare shit that's still blue in Mons Letalis - gimps. dead.  gimp
loots.  At least I got revenge on the Spire Lord for killing me 8 levels ago
(he's immune to snare/root/slow/mez/charm, hits for ~150, flurries, casts SK
spells)

Yeldema solo- dead first try.  Heavy dragonhorn boots and some gimpy shaman
spell (focus of spirit) that I gave to a friend.

Plane of Fear solo - run in... ehhh... big train.. gate.  Maybe some time
when the zone in is broken.

Plane of Sky solo - Sweet jesus this zone sucks ass.  killed all but 2
thunder spirits on the first isle, died due to LD, unrezzed death.  jumped
down after killing 2 more this morning.  Wanted to try princess solo but
clearing the isle is fucking boring.  Please shoot me if I ever try to go
back.

Charming A Drakkel Dire Wolf in Kael - level 52-56, if it's charmable (most
aren't) it can summon, they hit for 225 also.  Painful.  Captain Bvellos
down; Staff Sergeant Drioc down; outer bank area clear trivially.  Die to
charm breaking in middle of second Drioc fight at the same time a jolly
green giant punches my gate out of commission. Come back, keep killing, whee
(96% rez later on)

Corrupted Seafury solo - Summons; gimpy; dead.

Quag Maelstrom - Obnoxious bastard procs mana drain at extended range now.
Resisted all but 3 of the drains.  Just as gimpy as last time I killed him
(he doesn't summon), just more obnoxious.

Corrupted Brownie solo - No idea, thanks fucknuts for killing the tainted
and letting corrupted despawn.

Mistmoore solo (no laugh) - Sweet fucking lord I hate this zone.  zoned out
with 50% hp after something saw invis on my way to assassinate Garton
Viswin.

Net gain/loss - Heavy dragon boots, a shitload of faction crap for skyshrine
(that I have someone to take, so he can do my #$^ing ss bracer mq), Cerulean
pants that I wouldn't give my level 10 warrior twink to wear, some wierd
bracer (Tarsus Bracer) for my level 10 war, some ok cloak (Cloak of Torment)
for my 17 necro, thurg silk boots to mq, Glimmering Mithril Torque, a pile
of shitty quest items for PoS (tesserae), +6% aa, -14% normal and +35 pp
after rezzes, port stones and the 10 minute KEI that went away when I ported
up to sky the first time.

They're coming to take me away, HA HA~
