Sadly, that should be the end of the story right there. Well, you should
have gotten paid up front if you'd known he was an idiot, but what can
you do? Live and learn. People with faction problems asking for ports
need to point these things out to the porters ahead of time. I don't
feel it's the responsibility of the porter to "assume" or babysit. I've
gotten lots of ports for my Troll from druids, and I quickly learned to
ask for a cammo before takeoff to avoid the inevitable slaughter that
would occur on landing otherwise. Never had a porting druid turn me down
for a cammo yet. Hell, I usually got a Sow to boot, but then again I
tend to donate fairly generously.
