Bullshit.
You waste mana.  Which causes downtime, which wastes play time, which
is a waste of a group slot.

If I want damage, I get a rogue.
If I want efficient mana use, I get a shaman to slow.
If I need a taxi, I get a druid (at least they can do something other
than waste mana on stupid nukes).

Mobs don't berserk, level 57+ rogue/warrior/monk mobs ENRAGE.  Which
lasts for 18 seconds and only riposte attacks from the front.
Solution:  Tanks turn off attack, rogues backstab.  End result:  Mob's
dead, you're ready for the next one and you don't have to wait for the
idiot wizard to med back 400+ mana he just wasted trying to burn a mob
that was already dying.

I'll say it again, wizards suck at exp grind groups.  The only saving
grace is that there's now enough quad kitable mobs for wizards to
level to 60 when they can actually become useful (assuming they have
the paitence to camp for that annoying dragon in WW).
