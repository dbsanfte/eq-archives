What you really need is a pet druid, this will get you all the heals, sows
and other buffs you need (Shaman are actually better at this but they don't
come with the travel facilities of a Druid) of course remember, that a druid
isn't just for Christmas. Now the hard part is convincing druids they need
to partner you, they often have this wild notion of being able to "quad
kite" this is a rediculous activity that involves blasting off lots of AoE
spells and number of mobs (well, 4) and having them chase you around a zone.
You need to condition your druid at an early stage that this is a myth, it
is very dangerous and he/she will never level doing this, once this is done
you'll have a loyal companion for life.

Of course, if he still fancies the idea of this quad kiting let him try
while grouped with you. If it works, you get a bucket load of exp for little
work (you can protect him from the wild life while he meds) and if it
doesn't, leg it, it's him/her that the mobs are pissed at, not you (do make
sure he sow'd you first tho' this is done by binding "sow plz" to a key and
continually pressing it in his/her presence)

;ï¿½P

Seriously, I found many of the healing/regen potions are not upto a lot, the
only potions I have ever found to be of use are the ones that are always for
sale, SoW, Invis to Undead (called IVU, not sure how that TLA came about)
and shrink (for large races in dungeons/cities)
