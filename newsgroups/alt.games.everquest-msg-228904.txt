Interesting some of the low rated classes.  Without a Warrior, the cleric
tends to have to heal more often, ime.  Necros can do so much in a group
(debuff, steal mana, mezz, slow undead, snare, dot, off tank with pet, spot
heal, rezz, infuse mana, nuke, etc.) and so few people know because they
tend to solo so much.  Druids add DS, regen, HP buffs, heals, dots, snares
and nukes.  Shaman are much more desirable than BLs in my opinion with
better buffs, heals, and amazing debuffs.  To put Rangers above Paladins,
SKs and warriors is interesting, to say the least.  I still see monks
outdamage many other classes, so for pure DPS, they should be ranked higher,
but they also need less heals over all.  When it comes right down to it, I
would take any class in a group.
