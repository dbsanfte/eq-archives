No. In Switzerland, I live in the biggest city it has. Get used to it, others
are no problem. I'd be lost in New York maybe :)

: Ahh so as a caster, you don't have to take a piss? I didn't realise you
: meant that taking a piss was the Melee equivalent of looking at a spell
: book.

No, I only meant you don't have to implement something stupid, just because
it would be a spellcasters reality. I prefer if the game stays fun.


: No you were complaining about more than just the spell book, you want more
: spell gems, an automapper, a health bar for your pet and a hot key nanny
: incase you press the wrong key at an inappropriate moment.

True, but the others are cosmetics (which is why I related the automap
for instance as not really needed), while the spellbook really annoys me.
The gems would be nice, but maybe I should have pointed that out a bit
clearer.

: binding once, didn't happen again as I moved Bind wound to another page

Hm I only use one page as I haven't yet found how to very quickly access
other pages .. moving the mouse isn't it. Ah well, I should study the
keybindings once in a while... :)

: So, let me get this straight, you think, because of the challenge set
: against you as a PC, whatever class you play,  this game is boring because
: you can't do what you want. I mean you should be able to wear plate armour

No. I still hold up the spellbook. I never said anything about warriors not
being able to cast or spellcasters not able to wear plate and that they
should change it. Please stick to my exact complaints.

: No, godmode because you seem to want it all, now, You lose the spell book at
: 35, that isn't  "High" that is "Mid" level

No, just the spellbook. It's the only thing that REALLY annoys me in my list.

:> PS: Spellbook

: Yes, well I'll think of you struggling with your spell book while medding.
: My prayers are with you.

Might very well be. Some answers here are mystic enough in comparison
to what I was actually complaining about :)
