My favorite zone in the game for 15-25 so far.  I have gotten all good
groups there, the key is to fight with people who obviously are
twinked but not so heavily as to not need to learn how to play their
class well.

Establish a solid reputation as a good player and you will zoon
through levels in that zone.  I have gone from 18-24 in under 2 days
played.  In fact, my mage should hit 24 in 3 days 21 hours played, but
he is well equipped and doesnt ever worry about loot or heading to
town to buy/sell/bank...
