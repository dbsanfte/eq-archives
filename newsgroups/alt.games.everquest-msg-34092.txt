Oh, do you want to get in on the Anarchy Online Beta 5?  Run out to Best Buy
and pay the $50 entry fee...  I left AC for AO, thought AO sucked, and ended
up in EQ [which has a lot going for it, even though it's older than both of
the other two.]

I didn't like the sci-fi setting in AO, and the networking code.  Don't get
me wrong, the graphics engine in AO beats the hell out of anything in a
MMORPG we've seen to date, but the disconnects got REALLY annoying.  I too,
am waiting on DAoC and Shadowbane.
