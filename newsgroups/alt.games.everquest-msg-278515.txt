I think thats the wrong question,the right one would be
why did SOE cannibalize EQ by releasing EQ2.
Instead of having 1 game with a healthy player base ,they
now have 2  with pretty low populations compared to WoW,
not to mention the costs of 2 developing teams and 2 server
farms.
Luckily for SOE management the SOE shareholders seem to
have no idea about online games and are happy with 1$,where as
instead they could get  2$.
