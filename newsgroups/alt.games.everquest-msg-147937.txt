Yes, they've nerfed and buffed, but none of those involved the XP tables.
They seem to have two important rules when it comes to the XP system:

1. No changes that will change anyone's current XP, as shown by the XP bar.

2. No changes will be made to the XP value stored in the character database.

On first glance, together these two seem to rule out making any changes to
the XP table.  If they change the XP table, then to satisfy #1, they would
have to add or subtract XP from everyone on the changed table to keep their
XP bar unchanged, but that violates #2.  If the leave the current XP in the
database alone, then some people will find they have gained bubbles, and
some have lost, violating #1.

#2 is probably a technical limit: they were probably simply scared of making
any widespread change to the player database, because if they screwed up,
they would have a big problem.  I don't know how good their backups are now,
but a couple years ago, my server, The Nameless, had a serious hardware
failure, and needed to be replaced, and restored from backup, and the
backups did NOT restore things completely.  All guild names were lost (so
all guilds had to be disbanded and go through the reformation process), and
the backups did not distinguish between current and deleted characters, so
deleted characters came back to life.  That was...interesting, because it
meant many of us had more than 8 characters.  The client would just show the
first 8, and if you deleted any of those, the others would show up, so you
had to get back to the 8 you wanted by deleting the ones you didn't.  That
was just a minor annoyance.  The major annoyance was that it mean that if
anyone had ever made and deleted a character with your name, they got the
name on the restore, and you got one of the "x" names.  A lot of people on
The Nameless were really pissed off at this.  Now imagine it happening on
EVERY server, and it makes sense that they are relucatant to do anything to
the character database offline.

(Have any servers more recently had to be completely restored from backup?
Have they made the backups more complete?)

#1 is probably a customer relations issue.  If they changed the XP table,
but not the current XP, some people would logon and find that they had lost
a level.  Those people would not be happy. :-)

The trick they came up with that allowed removing the class penalty was to
leave the XP tables unchanged, but instead give the classes with a penalty
an XP bonus.  So, if a Ranger and a Cleric of the same level kill a mob that
gives 100k XP, that gets boosted to 104K XP because of the grouping bonux (I
think it is 4% for a 2 person group), which then gets split to 52K XP for
each, and then the Ranger gets a bonus of 10.4K, so they end up with the
Cleric getting 52K XP, and the Ranger getting 62.4K XP.  The Ranger still
actually needs 20% more XP than the Cleric, because he's on a table with a
20% penalty, but that 20% bonus means that it takes the same number of
kills.

It looks like, according to the people with ShowEQ, that this is also the
way hell levels were removed.  They still take more XP than normal levels,
but when you are in a hell level, you get an XP multiplier, after the mob XP
is split and allocated.  Normal levels have a small XP penalty now.

So, they could remove the Halfling penalty, and give Humans a bonus now, but
they couldn't do it a couple years ago.  As to why they don't fix it now, I
don't have a guess.
