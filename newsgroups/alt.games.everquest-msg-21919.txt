Not necessarily...  I was mucking with the colors using EQu
and I set the /tell color to something that the crappy
EQ engine couldn't handle, and it just "printed" the text
transparently.

I was trying to make the /tell (to me) lines more vibrant, so I
certainly wasn't using the black of the background of the text
chat box.  All I can figure is that EQ can only display a defined
range of colors and I had managed to pick one not on that list.

No amount of tweaking the RGB values would work until I just put
the color back to something that matched one of the default
colors that I hadn't edited.

I hope the Luclin fixes all these bugs that should have been
fixed years ago, especially with a program that has built-in
patching ability...

Mike
