Mana rate increase? NOT. When you are sitting on a mount, you increase as if
you are sitting (if the mount is still). Since you are sitting, your mana
goes up. But since the mount is standing, the mobs will see you as standing.
That is the major reason casters like mounts.

Speed? Depends on how much you spend. The more expensive ones are faster
than SoW. The cheaper ones are slower than Journeyman Boots.

Overwrite SoW? Not exactly. If you have SoW and cast the mount, you don't
lose the SoW, but you don't use it either. Get off the mount and the SoW
returns. No recasting needed.

Fun? Apparently. That's why you see a lot of horses in the PoK.
