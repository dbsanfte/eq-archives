Just a little update on me since I've never really been a regular poster
here but rather drop in now and again, fire off a few messages and then run
off again.

Well, my main character just hit level 41 (cleric), he was created in 99'
and it's been a slow process.  My second guy that I play just hit level 19
(warrior also 99').   This new land seems quite exciting and I've been
spending a fair bit of time in the dreadlands with my cleric.  As for the
other new lands, I suspect I'll get over to them in the next couple of
years.

In the meantime, take care everyone and hopefully you all spend at least as
much time with family and friends over the holiday season as you do with eq
:)

Cheers!
