Elm boxes use the sculpting skill, so if you're not up to par in that
skill, you'll have difficulty with the elm boxes.

From what I've seen: Tier 1 buffs don't seem to give skillup chances,
or if they do it's extremely rare. There is of course the chance of a
skillup at the end of item creation regardless of buffs.

Since I started using the Tier 2 buffs for fletching and scupting though,
those skills started going up rather frequently upon hitting the buffs.
However, the other Tier 2 buff set I have as a craftsman is artistry 
(cooking), and that skill does NOT go up when buffing. There are threads
on the eqtraders board speculating that the artistry skill is broken in
this regard.
