Since no one seems to have answered your question, I'll try to. I used
ZA with EQ for nearly 2 years. I had ZA Pro, though. I'm not sure if
you have the basic unlimited free version, or the 30 day trial version
of Pro. I don't know of any way to do this with the free version, but
in Pro you can specify that the program be identified by path name
only by right clicking on everquest.exe under programs, going to
options, then the security tab, and clicking on the 'Authenticate
program by full path name only' button. If you have the Pro version
and set this up, it will never ask you to verify everquest.exe again. 

If you have the unlimited basic version, just try uninstalling and
reinstalling. The basic free version will ask you every time there's a
patch that changes the size of everquest.exe, though. Sometimes this
can be a real pain in the butt and can cause login problems. Right
after I installed Velious soon after its release, ZA would pop up the
first box, then pop up one I couldn't see behind it. The screen would
go black, and nothing would happen. I'd have to crash out of Everquest
(thankfully I was running Win2K at the time and not 98/Me so I could
get out without crashing the machine) click the box, and then I could
get into EQ. Until the next patch, and then I'd have to go through it
all over again. After about 2 weeks of that (and remember, they were
patching nearly every day, sometimes multiple times per day) I did
some deep digging in the Zone Alarm Pro and discovered that option.

Longer than I expected, but I hope someone got some use out of it.
