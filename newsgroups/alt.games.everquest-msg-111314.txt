Ooh ooh, my story!  I haven't had a good rant about this one yet.

I'm sitting in the entrance to Gfay, right in from BB.  Fellow comes up to
me and stares at me a while.

ROG_01: Sow
me: oink 

(Next time someone just says "sow", I'm going to /smack them and scream
"who are you calling fat, you insensitive male toad!?" )

He stops and think for about 5 minutes

ROG_01: sow plz
me: Dude, if you are too lazy to write a full sentence, I'm too lazy to
stand up and cast.  (ok, I was cranky that day!)

ROG_01: May I have a sow please.
me: Thank you!

I get up and sow him.

BIG long pause, then this long rant comes out about how I need to see a
psychologist and how I think everyone needs to be perfect.


<sit there at my desk and drum my fingers on my cheek>  

This is about the point where I started wishing for the 1483rd time that
they made a server where you had a pass a personality test.
