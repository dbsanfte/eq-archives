Um, Rumble, I believe that was exactly my point.  To make it 100%
clear...
1) Davian accused my of engaging in "selective hearing",
2) I then asked "what exactly I've deliberately ignored",
3) Davian replied "Deliberately ignored?  I said no such thing",
4) and I then posted the sarcastic suggestion that Davian was
using "selective hearing" in a way unknown to the rest of us.
