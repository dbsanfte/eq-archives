So as I said in another thread....
The Good and the Neutral teams are going to have to find some way to band
together to survive.

The Evils get 5 starting cities, the Neutrals and Goods each get 2 starting
cities.  The other cities are up for grabs, but are mostly surrounded by
Evil cities, and places like Freeport will probably fall to the Evil team in
very short order.

The only way the Neutral and Good teams will be able to tell eachother apart
will be 1) by what guild a person belongs to, once guilds get started, and
2) if Verant changes the /con system so that a Good can tell the difference
between an Evil and a Neutral, and so a Neutral can tell the difference
between a Good and an Evil.

The other option is for Verant to merge the Neutral team with the Good team
so the Evils don't have a complete advantage over everyone else.  But I'd
rather see them work together voluntarily without a forced merger.
