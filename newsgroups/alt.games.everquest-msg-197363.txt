I should have said it's REALLY good for those people who are not in
guilds capable of killing Doze and Yeli :-)  The whole raison-d'etre
for the public raiding system on E'Ci is for people who don't belong
to those guilds and haven't got a prayer of getting in them or don't
want to be guild hopping slash ladder climbing for whatever reasons
(and there are lots of good reasons NOT to do guild-hopping).

So there is a significant population milking the old-world content and
items.  Granted we're doing now what top guilds did two or three years
ago, but it's the best we can do in the guilds we're in.
