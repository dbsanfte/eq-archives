I know several folks here are using Giganews. Have you guys noticed a
drop in the quality of service lately? Specifically, when trying to
retrieve new message headers or a specific message, I often get very
long delays, on the order of 15 seconds or more. If I cancel the
process and try it again, it usually goes through right away.

Trying every operation twice is getting old fast. I don't experience
this any of the four privately hosted NNTP services I use, just the
Giganews service.

Using Agent in all cases, btw.
