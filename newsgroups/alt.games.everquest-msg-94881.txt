I get that from time to time. In my case, it's definitely a pinched
nerve somewhere in my arm or back. Don't know what a massage therapist
can do. I went to a chiropractor with it when my hand had been
sleeping for a month and he didn't help; instead, he caused a much
more annoying cramp in one of my jaw muscles :) (I let my hand take
its own time after that and it woke up without me noticing sometime
within the following two months. It usually passes within a few days
or a fortnight and happens to my 'wrong' hand, so it's a minor hassle)
