True, been playing since beta 4 and have never had a GM warn me or any
guild I have been of anything. If you get banned, you got what you
deserve.  If anything I think it takes too long to rid the game of
cheaters and trouble makers, the view I hear over and over again from
people usually on the receiving end of some KSing or high end exploit
exploit is that verant ignores their complaints about "problem"
players. I've heard they have list of "problem players" . I'd like to
think that is right.
