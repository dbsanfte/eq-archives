Then we agree. (At least so I think)

My contention was that parents who have their kids in daycare, and who 
even take vacations without 'the brood' are not necessarily bad parents.

My comments about species propogation were at a higher philsophical 
level... its certainly true that the species needs to be propogated by 
'successful' individuals, but on an individual level its no reason to 
have kids, to be sure. My point is it harms the species and society to 
enact a policy whereby the middle class is systematically discouraged to 
propogate for any reason (including lack of resources to 'do the job 
full time')
