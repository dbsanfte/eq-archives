What has this country come to people?? We have countries out there
that are condemning us for everything we do, especially the media and
ratings. HEY how about we all get rid of capitalism, media and the
whole shebang and go back to the stone age, will this make some of you
happy. These people are doing thier jobs like you have a job as well,
give them a break please.
