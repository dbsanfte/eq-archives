I don't know of a list but I can warn you that using wolf form on Luclin is a
very bad idea.  So far it seems to make you KOS to all guards in all cities.  It
also makes you KOS to all of the alien looking creatures of which there are at
least four factions.  While certainly I haven't verified it with all Luclin
groups and factions, my experience there so far is that it makes you KOS to
everything you see )  Traveling in wolf form up there makes life much more
difficult than it has to be.
