Also note that getting a KEI buff (also called a C3) will
boost your INT/WIS considerably for the next two hours or so.

Similarly, if you get a Misty Thicket Picnic and a Qeynos
Afternoon Tea (commonly sold in the Bazaar), they'll boost
your INT/WIS by +10 as long as you have them higher in your
inventory than any other food/drink item.  Swap them up
in your inventory when you want boosted INT/WIS, then
move them back down again (below your other food drink)
when you don't need the boost (they're too expensive to
consume as your daily rations).  In fact, if you "force feed"
some other food first, and force feed every 20 minutes or
so thereafter, you'll never eat your "stat food", since
you'll always be "full".

It's an item made via the Tinkering tradeskill.  You hold it in
your primary hand while doing your tradeskill combines,
and it adds +5% to your effective skill level, thus boosting
the number of successes (but not skillups) you get when you
attempt to combine things.

The effect is similar to the tradeskill trophy effect, but
it's 5% instead of 10% -- it's also a lot easier to get, though.

There are seven different types, one for each of the seven
major tradeskill types (jewelcraft, baking, tailoring, blacksmithing,
brewing, pottery, fletching).  They can be found for quite
reasonable prices now in the Bazaar.  Do a search on "Geerlok"
in the Bazaar and you'll see them.  (Don't make the mistake
that a lot of people make, searching for "Gearlok" or "Geerlock"
or "Gearlock".)

So if for example your fletching skill is actually 140, while
holding the "Geerlok Planing Tool" you succeed (or fail) as if
your skill were actually 140+5% = 147.  These are indispensible
when trying to make items that you *really* don't want to fail
on.  Any boost in your success rate helps, and if it makes
the difference in a single valuable combine, it has paid for
itself already.
