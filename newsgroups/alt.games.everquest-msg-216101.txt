A group I was in had a problem where there were 5 of us
and before we went in the MT dropped (and didn't come
back).  With 6 we might have been able to do something,
but with 5 (minus 1) it wasn't going to happen.  So we left
the adventure and while it popped up the "you have failed
the mission" message, it didn't show up in our failures list.
Now, another time we were buffing just outside a dungeon
waiting to go in when the server crashed.  Upon reentry
the "you have failed the mission" message popped up and
it did count against us.
Personally, it seems to me if you are going to let crap like
that through the system, why keep track of failures at all?
Ah well.
