Really?  You thought it was fun spending days in Erud's Crossing
camping the damned boat in hopes that not only would a Killer
Shark follow it in, but that you'd be able to kill it and it
would actually drop the quest bit?  Oh, and then do it again
since you need two?  You thought it was fun that a Paladin of
"valor" (M. Marr) or "love" (E. Marr) or "nature" (Tunare)
should be sent off to slaughter faeries who were just minding
their own business deep in LFay?  You thought it was fun that
most of the drops, and the rewards themselves, were droppables
from outdoor zones scatterred all over Norrath making Ro armor
and its ingredients second only to Temple of Ro Cleric armor as
a source of cash for Druids who didn't feel like joining the KS
fest in Rathe Mountains?  I thought, and still think, that those
quests sucked even worse than the brilliant idea of sending
Paladins off to murder a Paladin defending his people against a
plague of undead in order to steal his sword.
