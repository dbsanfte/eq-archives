1) get a horse

2) bards don't use mana on anything until a higher level charm... and are
perfectly capable of killing by other means if they happen to be LOM for some
reason  (good thing, because the mana takes forever to come back, and this isn't
helped by KEI or any other means of mana regen)

3) I don't disagree, the pet summon issue isn't crippling, but it might be a
factor to consider.

3a) if you are playing half an hour at a time, you shouldn't be zoning with pet
up.  Find a zone you like, and play in it till your time is up.  If you want to
move, do it at the start of your next session.

3b) your statements are skewed to the lower levels, I think, as you get higher
and higher level it becomes harder and harder for your pet to solo exp mobs.  On
the bright side, if you only play a half hour at a time, you aren't likely to
get to those higher levels so perhaps this skew is really appropriate.
