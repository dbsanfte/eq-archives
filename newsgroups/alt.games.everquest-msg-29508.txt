I've never played a wizard.  You get a snare at some point, do you have it
at level 35?  If so, you can kite by snaring a mob, then run a ways, stop
nuke, run, stop nuke,... repeat until mob is dead.  If no snare yet, you do
have root, don't you?  Then root, stay at max distance you can from mob,
nuke, nuke, repeat until root breaks, root again, move away, nuke... repeat
until mob is dead.  I would suggest staying close to a zone line, just in
case, unless you have some means of running fast.  I have found through
experience with my warrior that strafing, hold down control key, left or
right arrow, and the forward arrow, you will outrun mobs that run at normal
speed (Thank you CF, I think you pointed this out the first time I learned
about it).   I am sure that other wizards here can refine/correct the
techniques suggested here.
