I'm thinking that since I have a GF4ti4200 and I'm not having anywhere near
the amount of trouble you are, the problem is something other than the video
card.

Do you have 512MB+ RAM?
Do you have a 2GHz+ CPU?
Do you have 5+GB free on your C drive and on your EQ drive (assuming both,
be safe and say 10GB free)?

When's the last time you defragged your computer?

Do you have all bells & whistles on in EQ?  That is, full spell effects, all
models on, animations,  high quality textures and a high resolution?  If so,
you should still be able to navigate bazaar with clipping at zero.
