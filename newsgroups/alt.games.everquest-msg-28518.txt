Found this in the Item Reimbursement FAQ:

Q: I used to have good faction with a particular NPC but now I have bad
faction with that NPC. What can I do?

A: Faction is never altered. There are currently no known faction bugs.
Actions on one end of Norrath can affect your faction on the other end of
Norrath. GM's will not discuss your faction standings or what has altered
your faction standings with you.
