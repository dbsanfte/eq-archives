Whenever my mana is up, and things are going well, I get up and bash.
My regular group-folk will back off and let me take aggro a bit to
help get my defense up.  If there's serious down-time (while waiting
for folks to come join us) I duel a shaman's pet for a bit too.

I WAS a stereotypical cleric from 20 - 30, but have since been
educated (here and in game [thanks Lance]) that I GOTTA keep that
defense up!  Been a real eye opener as to how much that affects AC.

I also *live* to chain-stun - fun stuff and really seems to help the
fights go quicker, thus fewer heals are needed when the mob can't hit
back.  :-)
