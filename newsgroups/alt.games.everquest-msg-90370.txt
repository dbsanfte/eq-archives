I would do exactly what you stated.  I have a lvl 34 Cleric on the Terris
Thule server.  I have been with a lot of different folks in different group
situations.  If I were impressed with how one of my groupmates played, I
would ask that player how to join that guild.

There are lots of great guilds.  I was recruited to my guild when I was a
very new player (lvl 5 Cleric).  I can hardly remember a time when I was
guildless.  Being a member of my guild is so pivotal to how my character
developed.  Thus, I would recommend joining one!  Remember, if it doesn't
work out--you can quit the guild.
