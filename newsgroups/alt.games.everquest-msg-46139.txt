>I have EQ Accounts For Sale


I'd be interested in those accounts.  I have to know what kind of
characters, their names, and the server they are on though.  I have a few
high lvl friends on various servers that I would like to play with but don't
have the time to level them up.  Email the details to me at
exqxmxoxdxexrxaxtxoxr@vxexrxaxnxt.com

Just make sure you delete the X's in the email address before you do, so it
will work.  Thanks looking forward to hearing from you.
