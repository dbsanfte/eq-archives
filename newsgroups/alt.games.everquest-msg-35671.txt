hehehe, Your mention of crystal caverns brings up a recent
adventure...
I went to CC with my Necro friend he is 46 and another necro in the
early 50's.  It was a quest for my friend....
So we go to the first split in the path in CC, and sit there, with me
pulling.   Were going for the miners because we need the velium
peices...
well... I followed the path tothe right... went deep and came to area
with the inspector in it....  I did a decent pull... got 4 comming
in... to watchers and the inspector and a rygor..
we dispatch with them rather well.
so this goes for alittle... I decide to go back and try for the
inspector again.    No inspecor but the watchers were ready..
so I use my stun to get his attention.... and he comes running...
I pull him back to the group... we are hammering him..
In comes 3 watchers.... 3 more watchers....  then a Whole GOB of
others....
This cleric learned much from this death....  and the fact I caused
the other two to die was quite heavy on my concience.

When looking back Im saying What a DumbAss.... but eh.. I think I
learned from it...

(Clerics shoulnt pull unless they are way high for the zone....i.e.
38 cleric in Crushbone)

Happy Hunting
