I used to believe wizards were all about mana efficiency, and it's still
important, but damage over time is what's important to me now - damage over
a *short* time.  .27 isn't that big to me; 1 second matters.  (Which makes
Sunstrike even worse, with it's longer casting time.)  In an XP group, my
job is to kill something NOW.  On a raid, I worry about efficiency - but
when a mob has been debuffed at raid levels, I can frequently use rains just
fine, and the efficiency of rains beats a straight nuke easily - but that's
not a discussion we need to have here.  :)
