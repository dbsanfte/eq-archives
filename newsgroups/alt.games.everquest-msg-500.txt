With the Detonator 2 drivers and a GeForce 2 GTS (32mb) I get the flashes,
too.
I just chalk it up to my character's getting his "lights punched out" during
training. ;-)

This suggests that its a problem with the card's interaction with the D3D
code Everquest uses.


However, I must say that its wonderful that after I upgraded my system
(k6-2/400 to tbird 1ghz; riva tnt 16mb to geforce2 gts 32mb) that I can run
in Burning Woods at FULL clipping plane and see no slow down. ;-)
