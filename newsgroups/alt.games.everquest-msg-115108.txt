     Consider it verified. That smithing the sheet step is a massive pain in
the arse, by the way.

trivial)

    The books that tell you this drop off Praetorian Myral in Grieg's End.
He's the guy with the DA hammer (and if you want a boring fight, go fight a
mob that procs invulnerability that lasts minutes at a time and which has
massive regen). The books are quite a rare drop, and just to add to the fun
the information is split across two books (book one details steps one
through three, book two step four).

    We're in the process of seeing if we can pull a Township Rebellion and
kill him with minimal Serubane weapons. The smithing is that bad. BTW, the
trivial isn't 250 - 250 skill smiths report success rates as bad as one in
five on making those sheets.
