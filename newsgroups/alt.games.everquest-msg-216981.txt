A check of usenet archives at Google doesn't seem to support that.  It
doesn't seem to have been used before around 1993.  There seems to have

of that song called "Woot!  There it is".  This seems to have some
connection to pro wrestling.

BTW, dictionary.com points to an acronym finder which says that woot
comes from Everquest players and means "wonderful loot".
