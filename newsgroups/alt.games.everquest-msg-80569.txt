I had a P3 600. 256mb ram and Gforce 2 GTS 32mb and it wouldn't run very
well even with the system turned to minimum textures and clipping with no
models

Basically you should be looking at increasing your system ram to 512mb to
stand a chance

To achieve the results I wanted I rebuilt my system with new 266mhz main
board, Athlon 1600xp, and 750mb pc2100ddr ram and it runs very well with all
features turned on. Although for raids I have to turn spelleffects off

Good luck
