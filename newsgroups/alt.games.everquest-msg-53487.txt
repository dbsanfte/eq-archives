No its about that or less since as you say its wearable by large only.
It sells for the same amount if you bought it off a vendor about also
(if a player gave up trying to save one)

Its far easier to get than the rygor one since if you do those 2
giants outside of Kael in Eastern wastes who are in alcoves kind of by
the ramp (reason why they are always camped also probably) you will
eventually get one of those giant tunics.

So no you did not get a bargain but got an ok average price.
