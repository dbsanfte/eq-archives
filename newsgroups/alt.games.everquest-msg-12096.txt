Go to Great Divide, fight Tizmaks.  You can see the ones
with weapons, concentrate on those.  These sell fairly
rapidly in EC at 10pp each, they are nice little weapons,
same stats as FS Steel, but they also hit creatures that
can only be hit by magic.

You'll also see occaisional drops of Tizmak armor which
is superior to leather and sells for around a pp per AC,
with rare drops of Cured Tizmak Surcoat which I've
had no problem selling for 200 pp each, and Cured Tizmak
Gloves...which I've never managed to get, but should
be valuable monk equipment.

The Tizmaks are good experience, and run slower than
strafe (as long as you don't let your hp go under 20% before
you dash) so you won't need SOW to survive a bad pull,
just strafe off to the Thurgadin zone.

did Tizmaks pretty much straight thru 28 to 35
