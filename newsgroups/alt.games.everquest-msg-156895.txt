I keep hearing about the 400,000 players and I am just wondering where this
figure is comming from? Considering the fact that Sony is giving away free
accounts to get people started, putting out expansions as fast as they can.
Setting up things for Playstation and Macs, and the servers seem to be less
crowded then they were a year ago. Ever since DAOC and they others can out
Sony removed the server population totals so where do you get the numbers
from?
