Ducking also helps for squeezing through. My little dwarf can sometimes do
it without ducking, but when I duck, I get through every time. Not that I
bother much anymore now that I have max faction with Paineel (warmly seems
to be max faction for a dwarven cleric of Brell, since when I kill kobolds
in the warrens, I get that 'Your faction with the Heretics could not
possibly get any better' message :P ). Hole key only costs me 104p, with 146
charisma (but my understanding is charisma caps at 104 or 105 with merchants
anyway).
