I actually found it amusing in a sick sort of fashion...for a little while
anyhow. I especially liked the Level 20 warrior who spent 10 minutes
shouting for a duel, then 2 minutes later spent another 20 minutes shouting
that shaman <x> was a cheater for using sow...

Then some idiot named "Phudge" starts some of the dick waving you were
describing, but he stopped shouting all of a sudden after I OOC'ed "Hey
Phudge, let me guess: your surname is going to be <Packer>?"

It seems that the opinions of their fellow idiots are the only thing they
care about, and if you can get people laughing at them then they clam up
pretty quick.
