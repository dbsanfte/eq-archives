For an off the track hunting spot try Kerran Isle.

Note : Check that you are not KOS

There is a sequence of 3 rat spawns that you should be able to solo.
They are monks so hit hard and fast, but the xp is crazy.
There is a 20% bonus in zone, plus one of the rats drops a tooth for a
quest.
By killing 3 rats and doing the quest you can get about 4.5 blue at
level 15

The down side is zero loot (and no one else in zone)

I took my enchanter from late 14 through to mid 16 there very quickly.

HTH,

JIm
