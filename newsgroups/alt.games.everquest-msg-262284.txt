Raid guild...MGB.  You say you have 2 enchanters with MGB...that's not 
enough.  If you buy DC over MGB and your guild leadership find out, they're 
likely going to feel a little miffed, even if they don't say anything to 
you.

DC is for grouping.  It's a fun thing for grouping.  You won't use it on a 
big raid.  If they want you to charm something they will want you to charm 
something GOOD (DC hits for max of 149...Torment stuff, as an example, hit 
for as much as 1100).
