Well it depends on what you are fighting, really.

If the pathing is good, then a pet is great.  There are tons of things a
necro can do in most single group situations.

Backup/Supplemental healer.  At 54, you have Shadowbond, which is an
awesome heal, around 150/tick for 4 ticks.  Make sure you have a Bond on,
and be ready to deflux if you need to.  Heroism or SLN is a must also.

Backup CC.  Screaming Terror really is a nice spell.  Should be no trouble
to keep 2 things mezzed almost indefinitely.  Combine it with Paralyzing
Earth and you are even more effect, as the occasional ST resists wont get
you pasted so quickly.

Damage Output.  If you have a tank who can hold aggro, your pet and your
dots make short work of most mobs.  Bond of Death is awesome.  Splurt is
good against things that live longer than a minute.  EB is great too,
though it can aggro too much.

Snare.  Dooming Darkness is a cheap snare, with some damage tossed in.  I
wouldnt use the higher level ones, they cost too much mana and cast too
slowly.  Some people prefer clinging or engulfing.  Not me.

Dont just play twitch bitch.  If the cleric, or any caster, needs mana
dumps regularly in a single group situation, then you guys are in over your
heads, or the person you are dumping knows jack shit about their class.
