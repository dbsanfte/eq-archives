I've put in all the hours to level and earn money to buy my characters 
things so I think it is fair to sometimes wish to solo in EQ. Sony should 
accommodate these people a little more I feel. Sure EQ is a social game but 
as more and more people leave for newer games the need to solo will grow and 
what then? Perhaps they will merge servers but I don't think that will help 
me out much.
