(No, not that kind of rape; the poem is entirely satirical and is basically
a send-up of epic poems like Odyssey and Aeneid.  The "rape" is the taking
of a lock of hair from Belinda, and the war that gets waged as a result.)

Triumphant Umbriel on a sconce's height
Clapp'd his glad wings, and sate to view the fight:
Propp'd on their bodkin spears, the sprites survey
The growing combat, or assist the fray.

While through the press enrag'd Thalestris flies,
And scatters death around from both her eyes,
A beau and witling perish'd in the throng,
One died in metaphor, and one in song.
"O cruel nymph! a living death I bear,"
Cried Dapperwit, and sunk beside his chair.
A mournful glance Sir Fopling upwards cast,
"Those eyes are made so killing"--was his last.
Thus on Mï¿½eander's flow'ry margin lies
Th' expiring swan, and as he sings he dies.

(I especially like the "One died in metaphor, and one in song" line.)
