The only 'regular use' jewellery you ever need as a melee, once you can
afford Velium is:

Velium + Fire Opal = 6ac 65hp ring (2)

Everything else is either situational:

Electrum + Blue Diamond = Resist Ears (2)
Velium + Blue Diamond = Resist Bracers (2)
Silver + Jacinth = Magic resist rings
Velium + Diamond = Resist Rings   etc...

Or junk to a melee because of the lack of AC/hp compared to other
available items for that slot. Some of the +sta jewelery might balance
out better than the hp jewelery, it all depends on your stats.

Get that though right out of your head. );oP

They are useless. Buy velium fire opal rings.

Velium Fire Opal costs under 1k for a pair and will serve you well. Most
60s are still wearing them. There is very little to compete.

>As a side question, what would be good for the ear slots?

Electrum + Black Sapphire = AC2 35hp 35mana
Sarnak Earring of Station (no drop) AC5 str5 (very rare drop from
Sarnaks in OT, LoIO etc)
Ivandyr's Hoop (tradable) AC6 6hp and some other stats (Inny Swamp
quest)
