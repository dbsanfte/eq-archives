I think slow is generally considered a debuff.

Having SoW 24/7 != having SoW mem'd 24/7.  Like I've mentioned in a 
previous post, it has a 36 minute duration.  By far long enough that it's 
not worth dedicating a spell slot to.  OTOH, if you're fighting 
snaring/dispelling mobs you might want to keep it up.  From the sounds of 
it you're not though.

Good plan.  And it is a pain, but really the utility you gain from having 
those extra spell slots for other spells is so completely worth it.
