Tried Minor illusion again and must not been out of the sight of the guards
got killed again when i cast the spell so I asked three druids if they would
cast wolf form for a donation. One wasn't high enough, one was busy and one
finally helped me. So bought the one I needed at this level plus the next
one wish I would of had enough for all of them. <sigh>. Now on my way to buy
nut for quest and that stupid guard is still in pool. Oh! got my donation
back when I went by Kaladim and someone wanted a bind and was donating. lol

It's just a game, It's just a game I keep telling myself.
