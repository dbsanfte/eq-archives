You misunderstand. Personnally, I want *both*, it's not an "either/or"
thing, and I'll likely do the group evac first. But one great spot to
solo, when the chance presents itself, is Fear after a raid when most of
the zone is cleared. You can pull trash mobs around the walls and have a
blast, a chance at some nice drops, and usually have the zone to
yourself. :-)  But if you've been to the safe spot there, you know that
it's not a place to be if you were already messed up enough to have to
evac.

There's some other examples, notably ME where you tend to evac into a
train that some group of idiots just dumped there on the way out. There
are more. So yes, the single Nexus one is situational, but nice to have
for a wizard when he's soloing.
