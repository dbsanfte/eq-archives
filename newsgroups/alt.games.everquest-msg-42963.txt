    When you get charmed, you're wiped from the hate list of whatever
charmed you. So if charm drops when you're out of awareness range, it
doesn't know to come looking for you.

    Another oddball feature of charm: players charmed sometimes come
charging at people half the dungeon away. Why they attack is obvious -
charmed PCs assume the faction of what charmed them. But how do they know?
My guess is that because PCs are sent all information on what mobs are where
(to allow for tracking), that the entire zone is considered part of their
awareness range. But that's just a wild guess about a peculiar phenomenon.
