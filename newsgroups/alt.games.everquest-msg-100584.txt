I reckon the increased bandwidth costs as the net gets less subsidised
by naive stock market investors are probably worth $3 more. I mean,
you wouldn't actually be able to login without the networks. I
imagine the more dynamic quests they're putting in with more complex
server side interactions are requiring more and more beefy hardware
too. And staff always cost, and want their pay to rise with inflation.
More customers. More staff needed. Staff wanting pay rises after
3-4 years. No! You musnt! You must work at a 1999 salary instead
of a 2002 one because our customers cant stomach living in the real
world where prices go up and the purchasing power of the dollar
falls. $3!!11!!!11!11!!!

$3. Not much. You want , to feel good about that, what? A 10 minute
response and 10 minutes attention every time you petition? That
speed of response means more staff sitting around, or less skilled
"call center" style staff who can be brought in only at peak time,
but will inevitibly result in you complaining verants staff know
less than you do about the systems they support.

Pay $30 more a month. That'll cover the sort of service you want.
$13 freaking dollars a month. For something many use more than 20
hours a week.

Yeah, its such a con.

You know how to force the prices down? Stop paying them. Go away.
Spend your $3 extra AND the $10 you no longer spend on EQ on something
you enjoy more that frustrates you less.

Or if you enjoy EQ so much you couldn't consider not paying for it
at $13 then maybe, just maybe, its actually worth $13 dollars to
you.
