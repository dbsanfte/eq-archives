What you've just done is the "restore the trader's supplies" quest.  See,
these traders only have a limited amount of HQ ore for sale.  Once it's sold
out, the only way to get him to sell more is to wait for a zone reset or do
that quest you just did.  If you'd checked what he had for sale, you would
have seen that he had a fresh supply of HQ ore for sale.

Smiths need this ore for high-end smithing, so they will appreciate your
efforts.  =)

That's the only reward you get for the quest, alas.  Oh, and you get the box
back in case you want to do the quest another time.
