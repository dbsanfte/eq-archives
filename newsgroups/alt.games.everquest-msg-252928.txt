Well high end Velious to Luclin intermediate can be tier 1

Luclin (e.g ssra to vt) could be tier 2

PoP (before/upto RZ) could be tier 3

The most important thing really is keep it simple.  4 tiers should be more
than enough to cover the full spectrum of targets your guild will be
meeting.
Maybe 3 is enough, heck if your not at endgame VT, or close to RZ, 1 or 2
could work just fine.

Take a system that looks good, but, and this is important, tailor it to suit
YOUR needs. Not vice versa!
