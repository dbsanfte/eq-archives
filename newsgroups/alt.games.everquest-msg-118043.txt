Jump off the boat before it hits the pier, swim around the wall near the
docks.  If you swim in front of the boat, you should be scooped up into it.
I've done it on accident before.

As far as faction goes, killing LoIO goblins an sarnak increases your FV
faction.  I think killing Iksar will do that, too.  If you kill the pariah,
manslayers, and such, you shouldn't hurt your Cabillis faction, since these
are outcasts of Iksar society.

Killing aqua goblins will raise your faction with the Stormguard, the
Butcherblock guard faction.  Not sure about the general BB residents.
