Well Einstien, what answer did you expect? As i have stated in my other
reply, you give no information as to where you are located or any clues like
that for extra infro to be given to. Do you take your car to mechanic and
say "its broken" and walk away - no, you give more information and details?
Also as previously stated it is a _ computer game _ , and now children,
where do you buy computer games? all together now....

And if my reply offended your sensisbilites it probably a good thing (tm)
you keep away from EQ, cos you wont last 5 minutes.


Ben
