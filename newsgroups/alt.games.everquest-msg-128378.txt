You could do it like this:

/target tankname
/assist
/attack off

You don't have to have the /target tankname if you dont want.. you could
just target the tank manually & then the subsequent 2 commands would work.
When you assist someone your target changes to the mob they are attacking
and you start trying to hit the mob with your weapon. So, /attack off is
there to stop you attacking, which will leave you with the mob targetted.
