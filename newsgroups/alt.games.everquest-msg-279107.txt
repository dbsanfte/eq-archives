I must have the same laptop! actually a few models have that design.
Heat is a big problem, which is why you dont see such a big push on
StateOftheArt processors, or a big push on current generation video
chips. A program like EQ uses all the resources of a computer (video,
memory, even the HD) on a continuous basis which stresses the
compromised designs of laptops.

PS the intake fans and interior heatsinks can get dusty...make sure you
blast them with air once in a while.
