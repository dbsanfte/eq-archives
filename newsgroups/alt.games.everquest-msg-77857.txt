>My ranger (who's only whimpy
>>> level 26 now) seems spend too much making cheapy Class 1, 150 range
>>> arrows 

I put as many points as I was allowed in fletching.  Then I printed off the
"cheapest way to fletch guide" off the internet and have been using it as an
arrow making bible.  Yes, it DID seem expensive when I started.  At level 40
the price of the components needed to continue to gain fletching experience is
not an issue, (I am at 132).
