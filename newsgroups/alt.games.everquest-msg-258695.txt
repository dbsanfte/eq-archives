Thanks Martin : )

Sounds like I need to prod our enchanter into getting GoD and heading over
there.   He was under the belief that there wasn't anything we could do by
ourselves there.

Our normal group is a bunch of old friends... so it doesn't change very
much, and doesn't always cover all the bases.

Warrior (myself), a druid and an enchanter are always present.  100 - 150
AA's.  Pre-elemental gear, but good for that level. Some VP quests
completed.  (Got the book for the enchanter yesterday!  Woo!)   Enchanter is
botted by the druid if he is not able to come online himeslf.  If he is
online, then the druid will bot a 59 (and rising) cleric instead.

We're often joined by a warrior with gear that is not as good as mine.
(not really very close, although single group drops might be catching him up
slowly.) And a few rogues.   One elemental / time, one pre-elemntal and one
that hasn't quite made 65 yet.    We might possibly convince a (time) shaman
friend to come help.

Is this something that would even be worth attempting for us?    Recruiting
LFG's to fill up certain classes is sort of out of consideration.  We just
don't play that way.
