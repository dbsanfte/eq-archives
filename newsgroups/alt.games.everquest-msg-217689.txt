Although the other post on this topic is mostly a rant, it did
make me think of something that hadn't occured to me before.

Dungeon difficulty appears to be based on average level of the
group, regardless of the number of people in it.  Dungeons on
Normal are easy enough though that a 4 man group is often all you
need for them.  A 4 man group ends up getting more experience per
person (despite the group bonus, the net per person is still
higher with 4 than with 5 or 6) and more loot (here there's no
"group bonus" to offset; 1/4th the loot is simply more than 1/6th
the loot), so if you have some confidence in your abilities, a 4
man group may be the ideal way to mow thru LDoN.

But unlike normal EQ, there's another benefit to be had
completing missions; points.  Points are gained by being in a
group when a mission is assigned, and having the group complete
the mission before the time limit expires.

It seems to me that points are awarded based on your level
compared to the average level of the group; NOT by your share of
the total level of the group.  In other words, if the average
level is 33 and you are 30, you get 3 points.  If the average
level is 33 and you are 36, you get 4 points.  But thats it. 
Doesn't matter if there are 4, 5, or 6 players, only thing that
matters is dungeon difficulty (thus the "average level of the
group part) and your own level.

SO if we are going in with 4 people for the better exp and loot,
whats to stop us taking on two additional members and then having
them never bother zoning in?  They won't cost us any exp or loot
OR points.  And they each get points for free.

Further, if the dungeon we are getting is still too easy for us,
whats to stop us taking on two high level members to raise the
average level of the group so we get assigned a higher level
dungeon, for even more exp and better loot and more points for
all?

Or if its harder than we'd like, taking on a couple minimum level
people to lower the average, so our 4 man team doesn't get overly
taxed?

Seems to me guilds in particular could benefit from this, having
AFK members sucking up free points, or even Not AFK ones; can you
join a different group or raid while still in a mission?

Note that none of what I'm suggesting has anything to do with the
nefarious practice described by the OP of the first Leach thread,
who was talking about people deceptively doing this to groups
that actually wanted that 5th or 6th person.  But that is where I
got to thinking about this; other than being short handed, what
is it really costing those groups to support the leaches?

Now the down side of all this is, it strikes me as an exploit,
using the game system itself to get benefit without working for
it.
