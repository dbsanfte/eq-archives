Not a brilliant idea.  The problem is that (I've been told) a wandering
skelly can path close to the OT port-in point - it's inside a boat under
repair/construction - and aggro.  If you're meleeing, you're not invisible
porting in, and if you've just zoned, it's highly unlikely you're under an
illusion.  That means you're betting that a wandering mob won't be in the
wrong place every time you port in.  If it does aggro - it'll aggro the
other workers in the area, and chain-aggro will bring half the fort.

Note this is based on what I've been told, not on my personal experiences,
so it's suspect - but it's why I never bothered getting an OT hammer, as
this is from a highly reliable source.
