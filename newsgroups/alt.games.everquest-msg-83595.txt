Actually, it's called "Policy" and "Rules and Guidelines."  As far
as the "[it] states that it's open to interpretation" statement,
care to quote it or are you just making things up?

"If a name is found to be in violation.." is hardly "open to
interpretation" when it can be clearly proven to be a
copyright or trademark.   A name from popular fiction
is always open since the rule is vague;  trademarks and
copyrights don't qualify.
