Don't jump to conclusions so fast. Was it a pull, or a train? Gnoll Elites
are pretty deep into BB, and their are plenty of places to sit and pull them
to that nowhere near the entrance. But what happens is someone will get a
bad pull, start running for the zone, with every gnoll they place jumping on
the bandwagon.

Once the puller zones, all the scrawny gnolls, gnolls, patrolling gnolls,
seem to disperse ... but the gnoll elites will sit there and wait to see if
the puller is coming back. Then you zone in, and ... well, ya'll look alike
:)

My best advice would be: if you see someone sitting near the zone line, ask
if they just pulled a train. If they say yes, sit down with them. Better
safe than sorry.
