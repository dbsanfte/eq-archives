Well, perhaps many people do say that regarding stamina and swimming, I had
never heard it before, the only effect that I had heard about in the past is
the one on weapon swinging.  I do know the subject of the thread, but, as I
said, the only below 100 stamina effect I was aware of was in weapon swing
timing, hence my question.  Although the subject was about swimming, your
reply was, at least to me, vague.
