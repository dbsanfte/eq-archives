Someone had told me you could make a hotkey that would auto twist songs for
you.  If I could figure out how to do that it would be no problem.  I can't
twist more than 2 songs.  I tried four and by the time I got to the third
one the first one had worn off.  I dont have the concentration to twist 5
songs and fight and pull and do all the magnificent stuff you can do as a
bard.  I guess I am not as good of an EQ player as you are and prob. never
will be.
