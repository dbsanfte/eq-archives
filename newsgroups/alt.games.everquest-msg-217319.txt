Fascinating. I can tell the difference, and in my case prefer the taste 
of Coke Classic quite a bit over Pepsi. I'll generally choose Rootbeer 
or 7-Up when at a Pepsi establishment, and I'll notice when I've ordered 
a Coke at a place that just says "Pop $1.00" and been served a Pepsi. 
But I've have never taken a 'Pepsi Challenge'.

I suspected there had to be something underhanded going on to get blind 
taste testers, and often Coke fans at that, to reliably choose Pepsi.

Twigging the temperature is just dirty pool. Lots of people are 
relatively indifferent to the two, and would easily be swayed to choose 
Pepsi if it were markedly colder.
