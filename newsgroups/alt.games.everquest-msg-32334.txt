Its a shame that the CDs are only useful as coasters now you've
registered a non-transferrable account with them - still, �20 off isn't
bad to account for the reduced functionality I suppose(not being able to
play the game).

For comparison, one could go buy the EQ Deluxe edition containing
EQ+RoK+SoV for �27.99 from Amazon, have a pristine unused copy with an
account that won't get banned if Verant notice its been transferred
(since it won't have been), not risk buying an account that may have
been banned already for all you know, and not have to read that stupid,
error-laden POS excuse for a guidebook by Prima, thus being forced to
use useful guides on the web instead.
