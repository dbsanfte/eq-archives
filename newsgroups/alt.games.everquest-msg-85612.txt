One poster in that thread wrote this:

"Gingdied hacked about 4-5 lvl 60 accounts, changed PWs,
deleted/removed/destroyed epics ect. Even sold some. Then posted on
guild board and laughed about it."


Now, much as I enjoy seeing some dweeb who desperately deserves it get
burned to the ground, and with zero sympathy for the putz, I can't
escape a certain thought...

How did he hack those accounts?

The only answer I can come up with is that he didn't, not in any "dark
use of technology" sense. Far more likely the accounts in question
were compromised to start with, either through password sharing within
a guild or by having been bought and sold.

So while on the one hand I'm as amused as anyone else at how toasted
he is, on the other hand the owners of the 'hacked' accounts are
likely the ones really at fault.
