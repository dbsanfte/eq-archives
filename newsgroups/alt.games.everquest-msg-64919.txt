I swear EQ users have this cultish, "group thought" process going on. If
Sony told you the game would look better after drinking poisoned fruit
punch, you guys would pre-order it and drink it as soon as it arrived in the
mail. If you don't know what I'm talking about, read "The Lottery." It just
may save you one day. :)
