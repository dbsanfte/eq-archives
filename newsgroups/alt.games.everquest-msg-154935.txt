Maybe a noob question, but I sorta AM a noob..what's KEI?  I have never 
asked for it, and don't play a caster, so I have NO idea what it is.  
Haven't thought about asking the friend that got me into this game, 
either, sa I only seem to think about it when I read something about it 
here.  Anyone willing to tell me what it is?
