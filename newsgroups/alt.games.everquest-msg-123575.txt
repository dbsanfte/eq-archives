That is your opinion of what is right and what is wrong, it does not make it
universal.  You are just trying to persuade us that your view is the correct
one.  There are certainly degrees of right and wrong, some things are more
or less right than others.  Sometimes circumstances can change how wrong
something is.  The dictates of the particular society that you live in can
change whether or not something is right or wrong.

Is homosexuality right or wrong?  Depending on who you ask, you will get
vastly differing answers.  Different cultures have varying opinions on that
one as well as different religions having varying opinions.

As to religion, you can believe what you will, but some of us are not
religious.
