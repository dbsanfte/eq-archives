WOOT... 

How 'bout a Section of The Fabled Lodizal's Shell for use in a Fabled
Lodizal Shell Shield quest? 

...or The Fabled Helmet of Rallos Zek? 

...would they do a Fabled Tunare who drops The Fabled Girdle of Living
Thorns?  The current Tunare can be taken easily by a 3-4 group raid if
they all pull in the same direction, fewer peeps if they're really on
their game.  Fabled Tunare would get the point across if she was
perhaps only a little more difficult than the OoW epic mobs, or some
of the bosses in the OoW progression.

The possibilities abound. /boggle

Hmph.  I picked up an Anklesmasher in my early 40s for 35K PP and used
it to fear-kite undead in various Dreadlands camps until 52.  Then I
sold it for what I paid for it.  Looks like I should've sat on it and
watched its value climb. /shrug
