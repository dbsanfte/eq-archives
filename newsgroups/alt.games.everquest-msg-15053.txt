Not just a group of people, but a class of people.  They must all have
something in common other than just being PO'd at a defendant.  Usually used
in lawsuits where people have been harmed by a product or action (ie. buying
a SUV with Bridgestone/Firestone tires and having an accident due to a
blowout) or the possibility of physical harm Phen/Fen causing heart disease
and you were on the drug combo).  Harm to the class must be shown.  In this
case, there is no harm.  Verant has a policy that is well known and they
enforce that policy.  No harm can be shown.  In this case, if someones
account is hacked, the only person or entity that could be sued is the
hacker, who could also be charged with theft of service and credit card
fraud.
