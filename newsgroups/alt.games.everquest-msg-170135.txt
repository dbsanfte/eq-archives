That's definitely a factor also. Would have taken me considerably longer
if I'd been doing it under the old school rules. No CR's to get your
stuff for ten levels? Plage rat tails that sell for over a PLAT off
level one mobs in the newbei gardens? Bazaar sales opportunities for fat
plat for tradeskill items that you can hunt in the first ten minutes of
life? YIKES! My rogue, 100% untwinked, had more money by level five then
my monk had at level 25. I must have burned through three hundred plat
on gear already, easily. Possibly five hundred.
