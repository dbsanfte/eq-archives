I couldn't remember having seen this female priest EVER before,
when I first saw her spawned near newbie log in Nektulos.

Since i figured it must be an ultra-rare spawn, I risked
the faction hit and killed her (she is like lvl 25-30ish),
and no faction hit, plus she drops a "Priest of Innoruuk's heart"
(hers, of course ;).

I did that, only to find out very soon after that she now seems
to be a very regular spawn, but she doesn't answer any
hails. As the drop is lore no drop, does anyone of you guys
know anything about it?
I couldn't find nothing on the web...


Thanks,
