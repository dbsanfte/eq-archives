The necro epic is incredibly hard. Unless you belong to a large guild
that knows the value of its necromancers, you will never get the
necromancer epic. It involves rare drops off of underbosses in the
Planes of Hate, Fear, and Sky.

You'll do much better working on getting your INT to 200+, your STA to
150+, and your resists up.
