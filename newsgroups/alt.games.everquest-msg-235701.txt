Actually for the most part I'd say you are right. A few strength
points or +5 resists, or even nightvision aren't that major...
However, in my particular case the Tribute system was worth 30 bucks.

Bottom line I wanted to get FT for my bard. That is a big deal for a
class with NO other mana regen and with key spells requiring it. And I
am quite a ways from doing it by items with him. It seemed reasonable
that I would have little trouble getting FT to a decent level with the
tribute system *even* if they nerfed the abuse significantly.

The extent to which they nerfed it however was far more than I would
have anticipated and has, so far, at least made FT to appear to be a
considerable expense to maintain now... possibly unaffordable.
