Pass on the XP to do the money grind. Yup, that works.

Other tricks to increase one's income...

1) Get some charisma gear. Either buy player made stuff, or do some
quests that result in charisma gear. It doesn't have to be super high
end stuff - every CHA point counts. And if used faithfully, charisma
boosters will pay for themselves quickly.

2) Loot everything. Seriously. Every bloody grub you find on the
ground. If you're anywhere near a merchant, it makes good sense.

3) Find the right merchant. Whatever area you're working in is likely
going to have several, and the prices they offer you will vary. So
spend a few minutes in each new area to determine which merchant gives
you the best price.
