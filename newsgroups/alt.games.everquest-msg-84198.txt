strange. I bought the first three as a set, zipped through them like mad,
brilliant stuff. Waited a week to find out number 4 came out, got it, read
it in two days, amazing stuff. Trust me on this, King asks alot from his
reader but it is most defenitely worth hanging in there. Then again, you are
probably better of as you don't have to wait an eon for new material.
