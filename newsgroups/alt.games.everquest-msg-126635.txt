You're right... but Tyger is basically spending more time than he or she
normally would spend by helping, therefore invalidating his or her entire
argument about being bugged.

It's like when you ask someone on the street what the time is, and rather
than that person telling you the time, they spend 20 minutes yelling at you
about how it's all your fault that they will be late, and how if you really
cared so much about finding out the time you'd buy a watch.

It seems a little counter-productive, wouldn't you say?
