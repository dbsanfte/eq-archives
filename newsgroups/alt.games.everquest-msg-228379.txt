Congrats on your promotion. 

I hope I can influence you to make a change for the better. I while
ago GMs were made to float between servers. We used to have one lead
GM on my home server, and everyone respected him, he was a big part of
the community. When he spoke, it was known that was authoritative.

Nowadays, I had a harassment issue and it festered. Finally I got an
answer NOT with petition but by emailing Sony repeatedly. It finally
got responded to OUTSIDE the GM email and finally I got a GM email.
Other people report being trained, scammed, and hassled by certain
people repeatedly, and the stock response is, "I dont see them doing
that now".

I see a lot of griefing that goes on, a lot of scamming that repeats,
and I don't think that would happen even if we had ONE GM assigned to
each server. I know that my old GM would have the knowledge of the
egos involved in game to tackle the people problems.

This would take a little more than having 4 GMs assigned to each
server to give it 24 hour coverage, (168 hours a week, with 40 hour
weeks), and have ONE GM be the boss to be on during the Peak Hours. 
Many places in America have gone to community based policing. I hope
that EQ can go back to that model.
