yep....unfortunately l was tricked into letting this guy borrow my sword of
skyfire (it wasn't mine, it was my guildmate's) as he said he could refine
it more....call me stupid...what an expensive lesson...the guy trained
spectres onto me, l died, he had my sword, he logged, the rest was
history....
let's just say l am not too polite these days with any requests
made....hell, l'm still saving up to pay back my friend :(
