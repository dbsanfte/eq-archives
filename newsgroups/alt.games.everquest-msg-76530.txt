Last nite I took my lvl27 druid on his first trip to Luclin.  I used the
Nexus and went from Shadow Haven to Shadoweaver Thicket(?).  I was just
exploring the zone and checking my tracking for any unusual or named MOBs
when I saw Prince soandso's name show up.

I tracked him down and saw he was a normal looking owlbear that conned blue
to me.  I decided to give him a go ( I figured if he was a major undercon I
could snare and run away).  I wasn't sure if he was classified as an
"animal" but tried Terrorize on him and it worked.  He wasn't too terribly
difficult but he hit me with a 65pt spell quite often and had me down to 2
bubs of health before I finally wasted him.  Before the end of the fight I
noticed another player get a hit on him but I didn't care since I had done
enough damage to get the kill.

When I looted the corpse, he had a damaged pelt, a vial of bile and a brain.
I just right-clicked all the items into my inventory and noticed that the
brain went into my ranged slot (it was empty).  So I decided to look at the
stats on the brain.  It was called Brain of the Beak Bear and I don't recall
all the stats except that it was +4WIS and +4% to Meditation (and NO DROP).
Yipee!

Afterwards I noticed there were 2 very high lvl players in the vicinity and
that one of them was the person that got a hit on my kill.  I hope I did not
KS someone's camp but I didn't hear any claim on the Prince and I waited a
short while before engaging him to see if someone would take him.

This is a very easy MOB to get such a high lvl range item that I expect it
to be nerfed in the near future.
