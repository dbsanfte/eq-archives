Not to mention an attitude goes with the name. An attitude that
usually is disruptive to other players. I was in Lake of Ill omen,
sharing a spawn with a shaman when I went swimming around and found a
pair of goblins, a soloing dr00d quickly swam up to me and proclaimed
he claimed both spawn points in this area ( that's four Gobbies). Mind
you, he couldn't keep them both cleared, he just didn't want to have
to wait for a spawn when he was ready to pull. I went down the play
nice rule and explained that claiming two spawn points while soloing
is rude to other players and told him if he didn't like that, by all
means petition me. Needless to say he just threatened to take our
spawn if we touched his and told me he doesn't like to share. I wasn't
in the mood to waste my play time getting a GM who I'm sure had better
things to do and wouldn't change that a-holes attitude or spend more
time continuing to argue with him so I gave the shaman the spawn point
we were sharing and before I left the zone for greener pastures I
fired my parting shot....

/Petition Is Junglejoe an EQ approved name?

About 10 minutes later I received, "Name logged, thank you."

Not sure how it works, pity I wasn't there when it happened. :-)
