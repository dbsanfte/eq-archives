The question I have to ask here is:  Why is it so cheap all of a sudden?

1) Post Christmas sales by Amazon to get rid of copies that didn't move over
the holidays?  (common for many items in many industries...)

2)  Sales slumping a bit after the intial rush that started the game being a
little worse than anticipated?

3)  DAoC is trying to compete with EQ: Lucliin by drastically reducing their
prices?

4)  DAoC has already hit a plateu in gaining new customers....and has hit
that plateau quicker than what they expected?

Could be any combination of the above, or none of the above for that
matter.....

I don't know... it just seems early in the life of the game for them to be
cutting the price so drastically.  While it might likely make me want to go
out and try it for that price (a good move in light of trying to compete
with Luclin) ....it also tells me that if I wait just a little longer, I
_might_ find it in the $10 bargain bin in Wal*Mart sometime soon.......which
doesn't send out good signals for the longevity of the game as a whole....

Is it just at Amazon?  Or are folk finding it at these prices elsewhere?
