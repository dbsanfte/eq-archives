Well, if gnomes get tinkering, halflings should get gardening!  I think it
would be fun to have a little community garden zone off of rivervale where
halflings could pay for a plot of land, buy seeds, and raise their gardening
skill by growing things.  These items that they grow could be used in baking
and brewing, and the higher the skill level, the better types of crops and the
higher success rate the halfling could have!  We wouldn't want everquest to
turn into a Harvest Moon type of game, but I think this would be a fun little
trade skill to have.  There are a few problems.  How could they take care of
the crops and how long would the growing season be?  It might be unreasonable
for Verant to expect people to log on every so often to water their crops, but
I suppose if they wanted to pursue gardening, this would be something they
would have to accept.

Any ideas?  Or if you think this is a terrible idea, please let me know! 
Thanks!
