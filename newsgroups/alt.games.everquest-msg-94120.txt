lol... EJ zone is a possible pulling spot for a group 9-12 pulling from
around Kaesora Ruins.
Tho if you're going to do that, you'd be better setting up around Swamp
zoneline... less chance of zoning into someone elses' train on the other
side.

Mystifies me WHY they didn't zone themselves when they saw your 'train
coming' warning... prolly just idiots as you pointed out ;o)
