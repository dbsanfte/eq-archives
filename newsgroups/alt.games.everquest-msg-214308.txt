With a mount, time spent binding wounds costs no mana.  SO a truely efficient
healer should probably cap out that skill... except that clerics druids and
shamans can't get the dagger (tombcarver?  I forget the name of the thing)
that procs bandages, so you'd have to keep buying them (trivial cost compared
to a mount) and carrying them around (eating up significant portions of
backpack space and requiring resupply).

Since you can heal someone up to 50%, then use spells to heal the rest of the
way, this could be a nice bonus amount of "free mana" in some cases.

For a shaman they'd be pretty useless since the LOM shaman is busy
cannibalizing himself and then force healing with Stoicism+.  Clerics have
CHeal, so in many cases the difference between healing someone 97% dead and
someone only 50% dead is none at all.

I'd think the prime users (among the healing classes) would be soloing
hybrids; rangers, paladins, beastlords.  Use bandages to heal to half, then
spend mana to heal to 90%, then sit and get mana back while the last 10% tops
itself off.

Bards don't use mana to heal, but they do use it for charm purposes.  When
not using charm to kill things my bard happily uses bind wounds whenever
badly hurt after a fight, gets him to 50% about twice as fast as healsong
alone.  If charming, though, its better to sit down and just let the healsong
play, since its rarely important what my HP bar says, the mana bar is the
real issue.  I guess I could get him a horse for down times, then he could
bind wounds while playing healsong and still get full mana regen... but since
horses work only while stationary, and bards are almost never stationary,
that seems like quite a waste for the little extra healing boost he'd get by
binding wounds.

Non healing classes.  Mages should max out bind wounds.  They have no way of
healing other than via the skill and some small self only regen spells, and
they have summon bandages available so no need to gear up with that dagger.
Necromancers convert HP to mana and in some cases can boost their recovery
time by binding... but they also steal HP from mobs and its usually better to
kill a nearby green than to bother sitting down for any purpose  Wizards,
well there's a class I've never played, but it seems to me that bind wounds
would be good for them like for mages; they don't seem to have any other way
to patch themselves up, sadly they'll have to buy bandages or get that knife
(does it work for wizards?).  Enchanters, hmm, same thing again, no other way
to get HP back, and yet my enchanter doesn't have the skill very high;
enchanters who solo make a habit of not getting hurt, enchanters who group
get heals from someone else while medding.

For Warriors its a key skill for soloing; kill a mob, bind wounds up to 50%,
and then kill another mob; always pick mobs you can kill on less than 50%
your HP bar and your down time is cut to a quarter what it would be if you
had to wait for that other 50% to regenerate naturally.

Monks too find bind wounds very handy, and they can BW further than other
classes pre AA, plus they have Mend; they can get all the way up to 100%
without sitting down at all, which is good because what a warrior can kill on
50% of his HP may well take a monk 99% of his.

Rogues are probably the class least in need of BW (well other than shamans
and clerics) since they solo very poorly and in a group tend to not take
damage, standing behind the mobs gets them out of even Riposte damage.   Yes,
they get hit when control is lost and the mobs turn on them, but it doesn't
consistently tend to leave them down under 50% HP, if thats happening they
probably need to find a new MA.
