Rather agree with that. It's like the fundies down here having to
close down every strip bar by passing so many regulations, it's not
worth it to stay open. If you don't like the damn things, DON'T GO IN!
It's more a matter, in my opinion, of them not being strong enough in
their convictions to resist the temptation.

Christians beleive we're here to have our faith tested (most of them,
anyway). Removing challenges to our faith instead of working to
resist/overcome them is like sneaking cheat-notes in on your history
test in school.
