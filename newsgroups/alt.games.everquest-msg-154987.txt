Wizards have two things the others don't.  First, Wizard nukes supposedly
are resisted less than those of other classes (I don't know if this has been
independently verified).  Second, Wizards get good nukes in Fire, Cold, and
Magic.  When that Druid or Magician runs into a mob that is 100% resistant
in the kind of magic their nukes use, they have to stop nuking.  Wizards
just pick a different kind.

At 55, I have good nukes in all three (Draught of Fire for Fire, Voltaic
Draught for Magic, and Ice Comet for Cold).  If none of those will get
through the mob's resists, I've got a Fire-based lure and a Cold-based lure.
With those, I can nuke almost everything, even very deep reds, for full.
There are some mobs that resist both lures, so until I level a little more
and get a Magic-based lure, there are things I can't touch...but neither can
those other nukers.

The other thing we get at higher level is fast casting nukes.  We had a raid
on Halls of Testing this weekend.  There were three Wizards there (60, 57,
and me at 55).  When the mob got to 40% and we started nuking, the mob went
down fast.  Each fight was costing my between one and two bubbles of mana,
because the mob went down so fast, I didn't have time to spend more.  No
other nuking class could have helped finish the mobs as fast or efficiently
as we Wizards were--even if they could have actually landed nukes.  (And
with KEI, we were at FM by time the pullers were ready to pull again).

(HoT was a lot of fun.  My group had a Druid, a Bard, a Mage, and me.  My
resists were a little low, so the Druid had to heal me three or four times
per fight (from the mob AE), and heal everyone else two or three times.
But, with the Mage making rods for the Druid, they were both able to get
their mana back in time for the next pull.  With the upcoming rod nerf, it
looks like that will be the last really fun HoT raid for us for a while.
After that, it will only be fun when we have a lot of Clerics on, and we are
a little short on Clerics most nights currently.  "/rude verant". :-().
