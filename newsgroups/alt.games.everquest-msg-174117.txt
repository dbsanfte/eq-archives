When you are in a (formerly) successful guild that's in the middle of
imploding, and there's basically no chance of getting a guild PoP group,
getting a PoP group on your own is more of an effort than I'm willing to
put in. I've gotten groups there with friends from other groups on the
odd occasion, but obviously they still need to put their own guildmates
first on the list.

Going the old "LFG" route, at least on our server, for a wizard can (and
does) often constitute *hours* of sitting in PoT advertising, and I'm
simply not willing to spend my online time doing that.
