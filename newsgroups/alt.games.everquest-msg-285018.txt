I'm guessing they work the same as any other proc (weapon proc,
spell-buff proc), i.e., the proc has a certain rate that it's
supposed to achieve, and the chance of a proc on any given
swing is automatically adjusted based on how many swings per
minute you're getting (based on weapon speed and haste/slow).
So the number of aug procs per minute, on average, should be
the same regardless of the weapon.

Hm, I just had a related thought.  How do procs work when you
have double-attack skill?  Is it possible to get a proc on both
swings of a double-attack, or is the extra attack not eligible
for a proc?  I think it may be that the proc rate is adjusted
based on your SINGLE attack rate (weapon speed and haste), but
bonus attacks have that same proc chance and thus can raise the
average.  I say this because people have described tactics that
involve getting weapons to proc on ripostes.  Still, I don't
know for sure whether you can get extra procs via double-attack.
