Interesting.  When I dragged a corpse myself, the X for the corpse
moved on my map, and did not go away.  So I'm surprised it vanished
when the rogue moved a corpse.  /shrug

The X's in general have a wonderful variety of uses.  I often run
through zones with the map up but transparent, so I can use it for
general navigation while still seeing where I'm going.  Having the
X's showing means I can also keep an eye on anyone who's following
me, or whom I'm trying to follow, while still keeping an eye on my
surroundings.

It also saves me from marking where the group's camp is when I'm
pulling in a zone full of look-alike landscape, such as Skyfire.
I just home in on the X's of the folks waiting in the camp!
