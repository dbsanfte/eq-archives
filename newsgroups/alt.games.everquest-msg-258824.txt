I know it true. I'm not debating that point. But my stance is that its 
just immature elitism, and serves little purpose. At most it keeps a 
competing guild out of your playground for a couple weeks. Odds are 
cooperation between high end guilds would get them both farther ahead 
anyway...as is the case with many guilds.

Besides as Monual mentioned, having one guilds strat doesn't mean it 
will let you win.

So it trickles down elsewhere. Practically -everyone- has friends after 
all. Its absurd to think that these aren't going to come out. Besides 
the faster and more often guilds end up in gigantic screamfests about 
cockblocking, leapfrogging, and what not at the high end the more likely 
SOE will be to address the problems in code. ;)

As far as the limited spoilers... personally, I think SOE has made a 
serious 'game vision' error by not revealing any of the info in game, in 
advance of wiping to it.

Any DM in a real RPG provides his gamers clues about the 'boss 
encounter' so that they can pre-equip and show up more or less prepared. 
Granted EQ devs -don't- want players to win on day one, while p&p dms 
more or less want to make a day one win "possible", but even so -some 
aspects- of the encounter should be revealed in advance.

What is the point of just wiping a group of 50 people by hitting them 
with something they can't possibly antipate, and knowing that if they 
didn't anticipate it they will wipe. Its just a time sink, and not even 
a remotely fun one.

I hope that he doesn't. I'd think less of his guild if they did.
