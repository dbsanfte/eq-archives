On Test they are trying out the patch server display that apparantly
will become standard with Luclin.  Whats it look like?  Well, you get
graphics, Tigerman, wolf (presumably pet) and our old friend FV, to look
at while you patch.  Messages are cramped into a narrow column, and much
harder to scroll thru to find the part you were interested in.  Can't
seem to copy the messages out at all (in order to post here, for
example)

In place of the current patch/whole patch bars, we get a display similar
to the current exp bar.  Seems to serve the same purpose, yellow bar is
whole patch, blue bar is current patch... but no lables to tell the
uninitiated what is going on.

While running, there is an estimated download time remaining, and an
estimated time of completion constantly updating themselves.

Below that, we have two boxes, one mysteriously labled Autoplay, with a
check box, the other ADVANCED, which gives you access to more patch
options, for "optional zones" and Kunark and Velious, with obvious space
for Luclin, that can be turned on or off.  In addition, ADVANCED gives
you buttons for standard and test EQ... I think to determine which EQ
you will use the patcher itself for, and an autodownload check box,
Complete File Check button, and Save and Cancel, presumably having to do
with saving the patch settings themselves.  Beneath all that is a
message area, currently blank, I suppose to display any advanced
patching going on.

Lets see, lastly, on the original screen, there's a button labled Play.
Trying that.
