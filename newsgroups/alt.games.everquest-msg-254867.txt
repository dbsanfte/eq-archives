and a good one....been playing CoH since near the end of beta and am 
just totally bored now, so decided to start playing EQ again . Once you 
hit your 30's it's a very boring grind, not that EQ grinding can't get 
boring but at least I can go tradeskill or something if I need a change 
of pace.

CoH is fun for short term play but just no content other than kill, 
kill, kill ( err...I mean arrest )
