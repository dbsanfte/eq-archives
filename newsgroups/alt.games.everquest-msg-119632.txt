The other night my wife and I couldn't get connected to EQ.  We sat around
jonesing for some evercrack.  I thought how sad.  It's friday night and all
we can do is sit around waiting for verant or whoever to fix the problem so
we can get online.

So, on saturday morning I got up and went and bought a geforce4 for my
wife's pc (I have a geforce2), 2 copies of luclin and 1gig of ram to spread
amongst the 2 PCs.

This doesn't fix a network problem and my life is still sad but at least now
it's got better graphics.  heh

The new graphics really are worth it.  I get some lag in different places on
Luclin, but my wife doesn't get any.  At least not in the few places we've
been.

Besides the settings in the game, I set myself to med textures, the wife at
high, any good tips on optimizing my memory settings (or anything else) in
Windows ME?  I'm running Windows ME (yeah it sucks), PIII 1Ghz, 512Mb Ram
and Geforce2 64Mb.

Thanks,

Lewis

P.S.  I have seen my first horse.  Very cool.
