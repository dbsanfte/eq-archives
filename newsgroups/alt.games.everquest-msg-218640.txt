According to math on eqshaman (not mine :P) a 65% will mean 40% extra damage
done to the tank (compared to 75% slow), 70%, dont know.  Shaman slow is
better than beastslow, by far, and it is better than enchanter slow, by
enough to make a noticable difference.

I think enchanter slow is better until level 39? Cant remember though.
