Fear kiting better than kiting but rotting at least can med at the same
time.

As far as quadding goes. I am not really sure it is that "efficient "
either.
With a 39 druid quadding dire wolves, blue.compared to rotting blues I think
the rotting is still better. Although quadding is fun for something
different as is porcupining, finding it hard to mobs to do this with lately
however, and  fear kiting.
