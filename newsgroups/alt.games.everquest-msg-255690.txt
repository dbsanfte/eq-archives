Once you have the bazaar, you can look to see what's available in your
price range.  At level 12, you are going to have an easier time
getting someone's older magic weapon than questing one or finding one
as loot.  In the meantime, you can ask a magican if he would summon
you a magic weapon; the mage summoned weapon is not permanent but it
is magical.  Specify the weapon is for you, or he may summon a wepon
only good for a pet.

You can look up quests at Allakhazam's site by zone.  Check quests in
your home town and nearby zones.  The quest list by zone will also
tell you which classes and levels are best for the quest, as well as a
rating for the quest reward. There will always be better items later
than you can get right now, but don't let that discourage you from
questing or checking new zones.  If none of the quests in your home
town strike your fancy, try another starting town like Qeynos or
Freeport or Kelethin.

You can look on npc vendors for some magical weapons or auction that
you want to buy a particular weapon. The giant militia longsword is a
common Kael drop but can be bought off an npc vendor for only about 5
platinum.  It will allow you to fight mobs that require a magical
weapon to be hit. Axe of Frost sells to npc's for under 3 plat and is
a decent weapon, but it costs a lot to buy from an npc; you can
auction you want to buy one for 5 plat and have a bargain if someone
has one to sell. Same is true for Axe of the Ironback which sells to
npc merchants for under 10 plat. The velium weapons dropped in Eastern
Wastes and Kael sell to npc's for about 5 platinum; they don't process
until level 25ish but they are magical.  None of those are suggestions
for uber weapons to last you years, just suggestions that get you by
for minimal investment until you can get better.
