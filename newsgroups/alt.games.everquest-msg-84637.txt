James, that's a totally valid point. And it's easy to fall into that
trap. If you feel that your entire life is "owned" by the guild, then
you are giving "too much" or the guild is expecting "too much". Yeah,
there's always something going on in ours that I could go help with. And
for some periods of time, I have. I soon realized that I was not only
*not* going to make 54 that way, but I was actually losing ground on my
xp bar from dying on raids and not getting any xp in the MA group. Now I
moderate it. I show up when all hands are needed, or when I'm the
closest Tank and I'm not busy. Yesterday was an excellent example. Tiru
was less than a yellow from dinging 54 (finally) and we logged in pretty
early and got the Hole entry camp with a mage friend. During the ensuing
several hours, one guild raid formed up in EK to do a two group slap
down of the Dark Elf Corruptor and Reavers for a few druids/rangers. I
didn't go because I was busy. It went fine, they had two tanks, and
nobody batted an eye. Later on, there was a pickup raid heading to Hate
made up of our guild and one of our Allies and they were looking for
tanks. I passed again because we were nearly done. Again, nobody batted
an eye, and Tiru dinged 54 Vicar around 8 p.m. and I logged. But yeah,
if you let yourself get into the trap of dropping everything for every
single guild group that goes to do something, you can stagnate bad.

Also true. I'm grinding a lot more now, rather than raiding on every
possible opening or camping for specific loot. And part of that is
thanks to you and a couple others reminding me that I need to get my ass
to level 55 and get Defensive a.s.a.p.  And fortunately, my guild knows
and agrees, so it's not an issue for us.
