Your rogue friend is a dufus if he didn't have the foresight to sneak/hide
into the zone to drag your corpses out.  He should've asked you to wait at
the zone, or in QH, and gone ahead solo to drag them both out.  He was
negligent of both his duties and his skills.

We rogues drag corpses - it's one of the things we do well.
