Dec 4th patch message

Didn't see anything about 95 myself...I may have missed it or you might have
the wrong day, but you seemed pretty sure about it....

> enough to know "if it ain't broke, don't fix it."

I personally don't believe in this statement in the computer
world....There's a new thing, it's called periodical maintenance, keeps
every running smooth and up to date....

I do feel bad for some of these people, mostly the kids that don't have as
much control over, well, money? I guess...But for most of the
adults...Internet and gaming is a luxury...And if you can't afford it, it's
very, very simple...you don't play...
