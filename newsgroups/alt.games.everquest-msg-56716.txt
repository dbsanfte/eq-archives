Yeah, but there are two differences.

1. Items have levels in DAoC, and mobs drop items appropriate for
their level.  There would be no *point* to farming some easy low level
mob, because you would not be able to effectively use the items--they
would be grey to you.  I suppose you might want to do it for a twink,
but the twink would be better off getting the items himself, so as to
get XP, too.  If you were trying to twink with equipment that was
higher level than the twink, it won't be any more effective than
level-appropriate gear, AND it will wear out much faster than normal.
That leaves wanting to farm low level mobs for cash and loot to sell,
to get money either for yourself or a twink.  As far as I've seen,
though, there are no anomolies like EQ giants that carry way better
loot than other things of their level.  Even without TLC in DAoC,
you'd not *want* to go kill greys for cash or sellable loot...you'd
make a lot more in the same time doing greens or blues.

2. Quest items aren't part of the general mob loot pool, and so TLC
does not apply.  A big problem with EQ TLC was that everything had to
be considered on a case-by-case basis to make sure no quests were
screwed up.  The initial implementation did not allow that.

The advantage of making quest items just general loot like EQ does is
that you can get quest items before you start (or even know about) the
quest.  It's kind of fun to get some totally weird item and keep it in
the bank until you find out what quest it is for.  (On the other hand,
most of the time it turns out to be a quest for something you can't
use, and that is often NO DROP, so you can't even sell it.  That's
annoying).
