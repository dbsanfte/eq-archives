I actually think the people who froth at the mouth about other's playing
style which doesn't affect them are more anti social than some person in the
corner quietly soloing/botting away.

Someone who is fun to be around will never be found for want of social
interaction in EQ. As for the assholes, well it's not the bot's and soloer's
fault they can't find groups....
