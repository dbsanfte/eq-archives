Not only do you not bother to reply to much of what I write, now you
resort to not quoting me as a way to further avoid replying.   Keep on
dancing around EQ!

No, really?  You don't say.   Hmm, like the anyone who read this
thread didn't know where you planned on heading!

Make up your mind EQ!   Be consistent EQ!  Stop pulling Clintons EQ!

*IF* you are talking about Big Brothers- Big Sisters, then *children*
are being mentored by adults.  Above you speak men being attracted to
men, and women being attracted to women, in a fictional  "homosexual
lifestyle".  Which is it?

Are you saying that you think gay men are attracted to little boys?
Are you saying that you think lesbian women are attracted to little
girls?   Are you saying that, EQ?  Hmm?  Are you saying that
heterosexuals don't molest children of the same gender?  Are you
saying that sexual orientation among adults is the same thing as being
a pedophile and child molester?  Are you really that dumb and naive,
or are you just saying that you think Big Brothers- Big Sisters of
America Inc. believes that?

Your obvious subject matter was:

And I did read that, and I did make 9 points contradicting your
statement, and I invited you to prove it.   You have since dropped the
subject like a hot potato and are now pretending your subject matter
was as supposed risk factor, and not forcing this "homosexual
lifestyle" you think exists on people.

Stop dodging EQ!   Stop waffling EQ!   Answer the questions EQ!   Take
off the tap-dancing shoes, EQ!  Stop dropping lines of discussion as
soon as your get cornered EQ!
