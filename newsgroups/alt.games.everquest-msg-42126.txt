The other night there was a OOC and SHOUT problem. People were talking
about the terroist in OOC and someone shouted that he "lost my best
friend dood, pse stop!". Most of the zone yelled for him to filter out
OOC, and he refused. IMHO he could have gone elsewhere or filtered.

If my best friend died, EQ is not on the list of things to do, but
thats me and my Silcilian culture. That and the veracity of his claim
is besides my point here...

I think the convention is
SHOUT - Requests, questions, and LFG for game matters
OOC - Jokes, "mundane" topics, and other NON-GAME-PLAY things
AUCTION - buysing, selling, and sadly begging 

Comments? If you don't want one or the other filter!
