What are the levels of faction and what order do they go in?  When I con 
something how do I tell if it likes me or not?  I'll list the ones I can think 
of and could someone fill in the rest and put them in order from 'I really 
like you' to 'I really hate you'.

Warmly
Dubiously
Indifferent
Scowls
