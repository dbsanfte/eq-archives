    The cleric formula for total HPs, up to level 60, is 15*level +
(level/20)*STA. I imagine most other casting classes have a very similar
formula, part being a straight HPs/level gained and part being STA-related.
I do know of at least one class, Warrior, where they apparently gain
significant HPs as they cross certain levels.
