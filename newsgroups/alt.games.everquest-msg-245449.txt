There's a certain instant-gratification fun to be had in the very early game.   
Levels come quick and fast, and having the best (or even decent) equipment 
doesn't matter much.  A few pieces of banded and a magic sword and I feel omg 
uber.  :)  Death means nothing more than a quick trip back to your bind 
point.

Of course, the Bazaar makes me wistful, as I look at all the stuff that sells 
for the tens of thousands of plat and go, "Oooh, *that's* neat."  Your tales 
of the high-end really make me want to get there one day.  :)  And, hell, 
maybe one day I will... if only so I can see all these neato places for 
myself.  But I'm in no rush.

Being able to start over and over again isn't anything to really *admire*... 
I dunno 'bout Mr. Hawman, but I don't start new characters for anything other 
than kicks.  And I'm no saint, either; I'll happily accept gifts of twinkage 
(in whatever form) from other players, so there's no high-and-mighty about 
bringing myself up by my own bootstraps.  Heck, I admire people like yourself 
who can stick with *one* character, get them into the end game, play at the 
highest-level encounters (and play them well) and still manage to be nice 
folks (rather than 'hahaha omg n00b' types).

True story:

Tanra (who I mistakenly called Crocuta in another post) the Vah Shir Rogue 
was in Blackburrow on Morden Rasp the other day.  She'd just taken her 
earnings from North Qeynos to the Bazaar and was dressed in some banded (and 
similar), some cloth, and was very proudly wielding a Fading Shadow Dagger 
(4/18, +2 HP).  Big improvement over the cloth/leather boots/newbie dagger 
she had before.

Anyway, she was gleefully slaughtering the mangy dogpeople when a human 
warrior in his mid-teens hails her.  Didn't inspect him or anything, but he 
was wearing plate stuff, and he asked her to link the dagger she was using.  
So she did, and he looked at it and said, "Hmm. Well, at least you hit fast." 

And then he ran off, leaving the cat feeling bemused and disgruntled and 
wondering if the hairless monkey had just insulted her.
