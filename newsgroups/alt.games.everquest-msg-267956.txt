Trouble can be that they have so much text flowing through their
window your chat got lost in it all. I make it a point to turn off
combat and casting messages. Made it easier to follow conversation
that was usually scrolled through real quick.

Here is my POV on RP on non RP server. I won't offer a group to a RPer
and if they use LFG with it; they get ignored when I am trying to form
groups. It's not my job to figure out how and if you are desirable for
a group. The only time I RP is when I want to be left alone. I don't
speak for everybody, but that is just my POV on RPing on non-RP
server.
