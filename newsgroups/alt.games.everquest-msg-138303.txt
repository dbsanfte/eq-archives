The only thing you'd have to worry about would be wandering
undead if the prep and house clearing took the daytime raid
into nightime.  At level 34, all it takes is a surprise pair of HT's
from a rotting knight or so to kill you.

But if you stay hidden that shouldn't be a problem....I've got some
screenshots from right next to the fully spawned house (two
with the Coercer wearing a Kedge).  None of the DE's in the
house see through invis, so unless one lucked out and got
you by pure level-difference (and mobs do check every tick or
so, so it IS possible), you'd be ok.
