Gnoll Brewer, and Gnoll Master brewer. They both spawn on the same spot,
which is (very heavily) placeheld by a Gnoll Guardsman down by the pirahnah
lake. Coming down the ramp from the surface, take a right at the meditation
room and go over the little bridge, go right down the incline. At the
bottom there is a boulder on the left side, and the guardsman spawns
between that boulder and the lake, a little bit to the left.

The brewer is a rare spawn (maybe 1 in 25-30 guardsman), and has the cask
maybe 1 in 4.

The master brewer is almost fictional he is so rare. I'd doubt his
existance except that I saw him once (And I have more /played time in
blackburrow than most people have on their whole account). Your odds of
finding and killing Quillmane (with the pegasus cloak) in under a week is a
dead certainty in comparison. Maybe 1 in 500 brewer spawns comes out as the
master brewer. Advantage is that he always carries a cask.

The skin will also prove annoying. Super-rare drop from elite gnolls and
gnoll commanders. There are several booby prize gnoll pelts of various
qualities...but what you are looking for is a SKIN.
