Yeah,

I remember chasing something undead around NRo with my mage in the early
teens and I accidentally bolted/shocked/something old Puntar.  I didn't want
to whack him, but he wasn't taking any apologies, besides my pet was pretty
much into him at that point.

After reading all of the faction horror stories on this board, I remember
being petrified on my first trip to Halas.
