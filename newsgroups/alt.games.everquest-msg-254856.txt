Not locational.  Your combined AC is what matters.

There are two ways to reduce the damage you take,

1. damage avoidance
2. damage mitigation

Avoidance means not being hit for whatever reason, be that because the
mob's swing missed, or you dodge or riposte etc.  Your AC affects damage in
this way by increasing the chance that the mob misses you outright (other
skills affect dodge, riposte, etc.)

Damage mitigation reduces the damage done to you when you do get hit, so
the better your AC, generally, the more often the mob will hit for it's
minimum damage when it hits you, rather than it's maximum damage.

AC affects both avoidance and mitigation, from the same value.

If you're not grouped, the person who did the most damage and is still
'hated' by the monster, and is in range, gets the XP.  It is possible for
no one to get the XP due to range.  Also, if someone does 90% of the damage
and then gets off the 'hate list' (by zoning, using memory blurring spells,
etc.) then other people may get the XP.

>How are loot rights granted? Most damage?

For normal kills, whoever got the XP has the loot rights, until 2 minutes
have passed, in which case, anyone can loot.  (I think it's 2 minutes).

>Does AC lower damage taken when hit or is it simply used to determine if 
>you are hit or not? If not, what is used to lessen damage taken from a 
>hit? Defense?

AC is used for both avoidance and mitigation.

>What affects my chances of hitting? Offense? My Attack number?

Your ATK number and the mob's AC.  However, your ATK number is affected by
your offense skill, STR and ATK buffs.

All creatures of level X give out Y xp.
Each zone has a modifier which can increase or decrease the xp by a
standard amount (some if a level 1 mob gives 100 raw xp, in some zones you
may get 70xp, in others 170xp depending on zone bonuses).

How that XP is then affected by your class, race, and group makeup is
complex, and other people have described it.
