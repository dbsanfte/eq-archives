I've spent the last few weeks in Veksar, recently killing the "remains" to
get a warrior the Hate Proc sword.  The belt is the rare and you usually
have to kill 5-6 PH before the named will spawn (in my experience).  The
nice thing about veksar is that except for the far end of the zone near the
highest level mobs you can invis/ITU past everything and move directly to a
camp you want.  The bloodgills in the entrance can be invised, then its
undead until the golems, they don't see through invis, then its more undead.
There are several different named camp locations depending on what item you
maybe looking for.  The highborns 59+mobs seem to be somewhere between tier
1 and tier 2 mobs while I would say the rest of the mobs are less then tier
1 and give better exp.  Levitate in any form does not work in this zone and
neither does gflux.
