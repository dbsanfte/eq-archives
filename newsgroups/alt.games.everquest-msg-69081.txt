Actually what you do in the halas newb area besides turn in polar bear
pelts is also deliver 3 bard mails at once (when you can run through
bb ignoring the gnolls ) along with the karana clover shipment AND
doing the lion meat shipment on the way also. Another thing you do is
save all your bone chips, and buy out ALL the ones you see in halas on
vendors, for the PALADIN guild quest "crush the undead" in the second
qeynos zone. I did the above on the firiona vie server and:

Got to level 12 fairly fast.
Had full patchwork, some leather and 5 plat by level 5 at which point
as a shaman I started gating back to halas making it far faster. Got a
polar bear cloak as a reward for the karana clover shipment once
(rare) Got the xp for the lion meat shipment and also started turning
it in to Icebear when high enough to have sow and also conveniently
doing a leg of the "bring the elixr to the young warriors " quest. 

I was soon buying out halas vendors of up to 150 bone chips at a time
to go and do the qeynos paladin 6 bone box quest. Its really one of
the best XP bone chip quests in the game and one many people seem to
forget about (or the fools would have not sold so many bone chips for
me to level up on in halas.. AHAHAHHAHAH!!!!) 

I mostly screwed getting xp from kills for a bit because there was so
much competition. When I was around level 11 or something is when I
started full scale killing rabid grizzlys for their xp pelts and
eventually wisps then saving up stones to turn in to that lady in NK.

Sometime after that I went to the warrans but was not having much luck
getting ringmail and then heard of a smith in freeport selling banded
at one plat per ac. Since I was still semi loaded from earlier quests
and bard mails and now from some bronze weapons I'd sold to vendors, I
dashed back to freeport and was in full banded by level 13.

Vah shirs newb area really sucks ass though. I started a vah shir
shaman and due to the lag and the fact that I never knew where the
hell I was in that city or  newb area and trouble finding my corpse
and the fact that it was SO BLOODY DARK, I hitched the first ride I
could to WC. I then did the excellent xp quest a lot in the east
freeport sewers with the necro guild dismal rage (in case you don't
know since vah shir all have no god, I was apprehensive or above with
these people and even only glower dubious with the dark elf cleric
down there from neriak)

I then got a ride with a druid to surefall who bound me. Then I
started in on the qeynos area and the paladin guild bone chip quest.
It almost seems like they made a mistake and the vah shir shaman has
the EXACT SAME factions with halas and some other npcs as a barbarian
shaman (who of course has the tribunal as a god) I was indiff with the
barb warrior guild just like barb shamans are, I was amiable with the
shaman guild just like barb shamans are, I was apprehensive or glower
dubious with some druid factions in surefall just like barb shamans
are.

I struggled for like FOUR HOURS in the vah shir area and spent most of
the time lost, lagging and only got to level 2. In freeport I got from
level 2 to level 6 VERY fast then I gained 2 levels in the qey
hills/qeynos bone chip area quite fast. Now that I got a leg up I
might consider going back to the vah shir areas once Im level 9 or so
with sow since they are improving performance in luclin and hopefully
some VERY good maps will be out by then ;)

Many trolls and ogres forget the lizard men camps in mtn rathe,
especially the nice several spawn and one by the totem one
conveniently by the evil vendors. That camp area is quite safe and
even has two guards who will help you on the lizzies if the thing gets
out of hand. On every troll or ogre I've had there in mtn rathe, I've
never once come there and seen anyone else camping them so there is no
waiting in line.


>I didn't say that Barbs were a distant 5th, but weighed against the
>other BL races that do come in last.

Barbs have one of the best areas in the game for rapid advancement in
levels and money game, ESPECIALLY on a new server like I did on
firiona vie where they nerf every other races bard mail and other leg
up quests and JUST LIKE POSTERS HERE forgot all about the barbs and
how easy it is to rapidly get rich, possibly get a polar bear cloak
and get great xp just starting out as a dirt poor newb there.

Not only that but a barb shaman also can get that thing summoning the
magic hammers at about level 4 and up.

Bad area my behind. For all practical purposes, especially in old
world factions, the vah shir IS a barbarian but without the racial
slam, with sneak, with a safe fall that is not really of much help and
with infravision. Yep, thats right its only infra and NOT ultra. Also
in case you have not noticed, they did actually raise default vision a
bit so that as long as my barbarian had at least a beetle eye it could
easily run through the dark tunnel on the way to bb and see pretty
well at night. If you know how to work it halas is a fantastic
starting newb area and one of the best, non nerfed, ones in the entire
game. It can easily carry you to level 12 at which point you might
want to go elsewhere.
