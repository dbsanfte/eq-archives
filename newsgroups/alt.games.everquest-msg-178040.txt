Actually, when I bought my horse I had no idea of this effect. I have
all Luclin models off because a) I think they are ugly as hell, and b)
They still lag you like crazy on large raids. As I've bought the Luclin
expansion and paid for the horse I feel I should get the benefits I paid
for, and if they nerfed the mana regen rather than adding the drawbacks
they intended to a client running the older models, which would be the
proper fix, I would feel quite justified in complaining. It may
currently be a minor exploit but that still wouldn't justify a half
assed nerf rather than a proper fix for the problem.
