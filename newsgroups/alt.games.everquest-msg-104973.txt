If mana is low, I don't clarity the tank hybrids.  Period.  Tell'em you need
to save the mana for mezzing.

And at 29, you get Augmentation.  Its haste isn't as good as Alacrity, but
it lasts a LOT longer, and has Stamina regen/AC/AGI.  I used that all the
way up to 50, and nobody complained.  Great buff for you to keep on
yourself, too.
