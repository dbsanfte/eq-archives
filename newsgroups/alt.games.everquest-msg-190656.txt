So.  If you get a gun and rob a bank for several million dollars (a big
bank), does this suddenly make you a better person.  If you are are selling
something that you don't actually have the right to sell, that is fraud.  He
gets away with it because because of less than perfect enforcement, but it's
still not right.  As for the people who buy from him, they are all cheaters.
Doesn't matter to me.  They are the ones that have to realize that anything
they accomplish in the game is tainted by the fact that they did not get
there within the scope of the game.

Cheers,
Eric
