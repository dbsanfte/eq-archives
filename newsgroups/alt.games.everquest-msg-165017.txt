Want to hear something funny?  

   On FV, where most things lose the no-drop label, my husband and I
were sharing a pair of Jboots.  Right up until he dropped them on the
ground while looting a fully loaded corpse, and let them rot on the
ground before he noticed it.  Probably an EQ first.

Annie <--- Heartache is funny, right?
