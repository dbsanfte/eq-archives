When I've seen them they tend to cast fire and ice nukes which are normal
resists types. The only all-or-nothing spells Wizards get are the Force line
(magic) and maybe 1 or two others that have the interrupt-stun built in (one
of the draughts, a couple of Lightning spells). Ive never seen an elemental
cast a magic-based wizard nuke but my knowledge of these pets is hardly
thorough.
