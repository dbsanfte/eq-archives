A bug is a bug is a bug. Time and again I have seen SOE release code that 
runs "just fine" on most systems, but nonstandard/nonhighend systems choke 
on. Their testing regime does not include a wide enough variety of HW and 
SW platforms.

As for my cynicism, I'll shove it up my ass the day you shove your railgun 
up yours, activate it, and quiver in glee from the electromagnetic pulse in 
the millisecond before the flechettes turn you into a literal bile-soaked 
splatter of fur and shit, instead of the figurative one you are acting like 
now.
