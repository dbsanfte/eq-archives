you wouldn't make any lvl 55 people slobber.....they would have k's of pp by
now themselves!

l went through a similar process with my character, also a ranger, but lvl
36 at this stage.
My guildmates recommended that l go to the dreadlands for the next round of
experience, but l have to say that l feel a bit embarrassed about grouping.
Not that l haven't grouped (it's a given for HK and CB), but there are other
skills that you gain in an open area group as opposed to a dungeon group.
My main fear is not making a valuable contribution to the group and/or
having them wiped due to my inexperience, that and some people have a low
tolerance level of people who should have acquired some skills by the time
they approach level 40.

I have found the most help l have received so far (apart from my guildies)
has been from this newsgroup
