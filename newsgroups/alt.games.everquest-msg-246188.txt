All welcome changes, IMO.  I think Knights had every right to cry bloody
murder about how GoD was treating them.  There are a lot of knights out
there and SOE should never have released an expansion that made them less
than adequate tanks.  I understand there's a whole history of knights being
far better tanks in xp groups and warriors suffering for it, but you don't
make up for it by creating xp group encounters in GoD expeditions that
knights simply can't tank.  It just makes me wonder how much SOE really
understands their own game and the people playing it.  Although I haven't
played my main, who's my only character high enough level to get into most
of the GoD zones, for awhile, when I was exploring GoD the zones were ghost
towns.  I'm glad SOE is doing something that may breathe some life into this
expansion.  I had such high hopes for GoD.  I envisioned Kunark 2 with nice
big zones and plenty of grouping opportunities beyond just the instanced
zones.  I'll give the changes a couple of weeks, then check things out.  I
have a feeling that it's too little, too late, but I hope not.
