Just because I know:
http://home.c2i.net/monsalvat/wolfram.htm

http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/autoren/eschenba.htm
(unfortunately, Google won't translate it; so only useful if you can read
German)

Wolfram von Ecshenbach was the author of Parzival, which inspired Wagner's
opera Percival. The character is fictious and well out of the copyright.
Since these are the only two ways for it to violate the naming convention I
can see, you should be safe to petition. You probably knew about Wolfram
considering that your choice of spelling alteration comes closer to the
original than to the one more readily recognized.
