No, its not an undercon. Its simply a caster. A warrior mob of the
same level would be easy while a caster is not. When these are blue
you and someone else could cap them pretty well. 

The secret to this area is:

1) Invis

2) or share wolf form (makes you indiff to the brownies)

These are moerately high since they are intended to be killed by a
druid of at least 45th level plus working on its epic, probably with a
buddy. My 53 druid and a 53 sk buddy had no trouble killing some of
these then the tainted/corrupted brownies who spawn though corrupted
is pretty buff. Fear is a great thing ;)
