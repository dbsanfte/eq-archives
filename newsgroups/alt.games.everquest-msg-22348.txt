Eh, ok, I'm glad I didn't flame him, but only gave him a little ribbing.

My enchanter was hunting who-knows-where and decided to gate back to FV
where I was bound.

Oops, no, I was still bound in SolB right outside Naggy's lair.

Good news is that the giants were dead.  Bad news is that I get lost in SolB
pretty easily when it comes to going to visit the dragon.

Good news is that despite being attacked by a few LDCs I was able to stun
'em, mez 'em, then be on my way with only a couple of wrong turns.

But my heart was beating just a tad faster than usual.
