Uh oh... Here it comes.

Run and run and run some more,
Till I fouond what I looked for,
A blue-con mob just through that door,
Oh crap, I guess it's really four!

Run and run just like before,
Fit Feign Death and hit the floor,
Mobs return to their where, before,
And my tagger tags like I adore.

I flop back up and run to thee,
My healer and tank and whole party,
And as I kick so gracefully,
I'm hit, stunned, spinning, and dizzy.

When finally my will breaks free,
I turn with horror and I see,
Oh crap that was the other three!
The Cleric's going to murder me!

But then to my relief I hear,
"That mob is mezzed, have no fear"
"And you, you stand right over here"
Our chanter is without a peer.

So we whittle down the tier,
We kill them all and raise a cheer,
And now the monk feigns near the rear,
And says "AFK - I need a beer!"
