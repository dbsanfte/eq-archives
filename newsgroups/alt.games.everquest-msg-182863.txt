If anyone needed proof that KEI has deadened the skill level of the
average EQ player, this post is it. Notice how many of James'
responses are "why the fuck don't you have KEI??? You can't do
anything without KEI!!!!"

Pretty stupid group.

Okay are you being deliberately retarded? Alacrity is a little bit
faster, at about THREE TIMES the mana over a period of time. Sure
that's okay for one or sometimes two melees, but do you know how hard
it is to keep that going with more if you're also mezzing, tashing,
claritying, etc? It's not like they're getting no haste at all.

Oh yeah, you don't. You don't know anything about playing without KEI.
Fuggin newbies. You wouldn't have made it to 20 before Luclin. More on
that below.

You suck, period. Come back when you've learned how to play without
KEI, noob.

No, it would be 345/460 mana per 11 minutes, along with the mana for
mez, for tash, for clarity, for stuns....

You aren't saying much worth listening to.

While you're sitting begging for KEI in nexus from every enchanter
with a snakestick I'm out there doing something you can't do - exping
without it.

I take it when it's offered or if I want it. I don't, unlike someone
here, *need* it. Dunno how you would have done pre-Luclin. You'd still
be killing on orc hill I would wager.

Speaking of taglines....

This is the most laughably absurd thing I've seen here in ages. You
won't group unless the casters have KEI? You think the casters are
NEGLECTING their DUTIES if they don't have KEI?

Unless it so wipes me out of mana I can't maintain the more important
enchanter duties, especially mez. Perhaps in your groups you just pull
one at a time, nice and safe? Making sure all your tanks have aegolism
for those dangerous sarnak recruits?

And of course, any tank who shows up without it is neglecting his
duties as a tank and should not be allowed in group....

Wrong.
