<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< Depends on where most of your points are, but I'd hazard a
guess that
they're in MMC.  If so, at 150 I'd go for the Death Embracer's BP (I
did).  Stat-wise, it's pretty close to the thurgadin quest armor, ,
plus it has 3 aug slots, including a Type 3 for those nifty FT augs
you can get with more points later.  It might see you through til your
60 or so, depending on your play style and how twinked you are right
now.

But yes, there is always better gear available with more points.
Sometimes you need to invest a little to make it easier to get that
better gear.

You couldn't be more correct.  I have been thinking about getting that Death
Embracers BP but was just weighing that against getting an aug that gives
serpent sight or ultravision to help out my weak human eyes.  I guess it's best
to use the points to try and bump up my completely mediocre gear instead of
worrying about something I can usually just get somebody to buff me with. 
Thanks!
