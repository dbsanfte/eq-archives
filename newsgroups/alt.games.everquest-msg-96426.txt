Horses are pitiful. So slow for the money... I can buy tboots or mq jboots
for half the price of the cheapet horse, and the boots are heaps faster. Ive
also heard that you cant have a pet (or I guess charm anything) while on
horseback. Its no surprise you havnt seen a horse. I saw a couple shortly
after sol came out, but none lately.

I'd have liked to see horses made very cheap (a few hundred pp) but have
large penalties for fighting/casting on them, so they are more of a
travelling device than a kiting device.
