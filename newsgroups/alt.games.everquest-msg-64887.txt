Most likely that connector is part of your DVD player.  Early DVD
players required some sort of hardware accelerator to work well and
often had a cable directly to the video card.  I just left my
dangling, and EQ works, which is all I really care about at this time.
Though I do see a new computer in my future, especially since as of
tomorrow morning I'm no longer an unemployed bum.  Of course if I had
waited just 1 more week, I could really explore Luclin.
