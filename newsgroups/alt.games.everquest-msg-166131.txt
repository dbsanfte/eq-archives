These levels moved very fast for me.  Try Tenebrous Mountains, you can camp
at two zone lines that are pretty safe.  If you pull into the cave to fight
you will not get adds.  Just watch out for Crag Ligi, they can root and
really cause trouble.  DO NOT pull any Cotierie or the named bat until you
are closer to 50 and have full mana and health (nasty critters).  Everything
else you should be able to handle.

You could also try the Underbulks in Echo Caverns.  There are about 3 places
you can camp them and the Fiends and Stonegrabbers that pop too should all
be DB and soloable at your level. I solod these two places almost excusively
from 40-50 and he only mishap was once when I pulled the named fiend
Trillcor and another friend came along.  That is the ONLY time I died
soloing in ten levels.
