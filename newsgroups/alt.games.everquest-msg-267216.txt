First off, while I've never played an mmorpg before I've have played
online console games, most notably Phantasy Star Online (PSO). I've
also played more console RPGs then I can name, including Morrowind and
KOTOR on my Xbox. I've also beta tested Guild Wars twice and love it.

Anyway, things that struck me most in order:

1) For a multiplayer game it is very single player. I assumed the
basic game flow would be: you form a group, get a quest, complete
quest, get another quest, complete quest, etc.. etc.. repeat until
bored. But it's not like that in the slightest. The only time so far
grouping has been required was to kill that Orc on Newbie Island. Most
quests are of the same kind as Morrowind, ie go there, get that, kill
that. All can be done solo. There might be more need to group later on
but I expected that right from the start. Still, I often group
voluntary to kill random stuff.

2) It's very quiet. PSO was full of chat bubbles but this isn't.
Having chat scroll up on the chat window just doesn't fell the same.
Just enhances the felling I'm playing an online single player RPG
rather then a multi player one.

3) Its not the rat kill, level grinding, passive combat most non EQ
players seem to think EQ is. Ok, so I've killed a fair few rats but
it's because they are newbie enemies. Quiet happy with how fast my
char is levelling up too. Might slower down later on but that's no
different to any other RPGs. Being a priest or mage helps the combat
being more involved, especially in groups. My priest couldn't hit a
barn door if it was in front of her. So, I am heavy reliant on firing
of DD, rebuff etc. And grouping brings extra strategy into play. Quiet
good fun.

4) Totally newbie thing but the controls confuse the hell out of me.
50% of the time I get the wrong chat channel up or trigger menus when
I think I'm in chat mode. Still I'll get used to it. Just glad you can
select everything with mouse!

5) The extra .99c for things like screenshots are a totally rip off.
They should be in the main sub or free. Paying a sub is bad enough but
extras, geez!
