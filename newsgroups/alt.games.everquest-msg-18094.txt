I had considered that possibility... but, if that was what he intended,
why did he follow me specifically?
And why was he /anon?
And why wouldn't he just say so?

Sometimes an evil wizard thinks it will be a hoot to drop you in one of our

Because of the crowds in NFP, I never got a chance to actually see "nimrod"
so I couldn't visually identify his class... so /who = anon was the only
information I had about him.
