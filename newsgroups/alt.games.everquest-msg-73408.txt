I never said it was a task for a novice. I am merely refuting your
assertion that the two OS's offer equal performance in EQ (or other
games for that matter).

I never said ME didn't run EQ fine, but I know for a fact that WinME
runs EQ (and most other games) slower than Win98SE. This is also
proven through any standard benchmark used today. Win98SE is a
superior gaming OS to WinME.
