...and unless you enjoy being continually abused by Verant, you should
too. 

First of all, this is not a troll.  This is my farewell forever to EQ.
Of course, a lot of you out there are already saying, "Good,
one less person camping <insert item here>."  That's fine.
Even if you have no interest in what I've written here, I urge
you to skip down to the section "Taken from lumthemad.net"
for an interesting little bit from the CEO of Sony Online 
Entertainment (eg. Verant's parent company), Kelly Flock.

The decision to leave has been too long in coming, but I finally
regained my sanity and realized that Everquest is a terrible game and
the designers should be horse-whipped. The amount of time required to
make progress (level, aquire good equipment, etc.) past level 44 is
staggering, to say the least. I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm all for
losing myself in a good game; but this game is quite simply
over-the-top in its time requirements. Honestly, anyone who spends 40+
hours a week playing a video game should have their friggin head
examined. Don't kid yourself, it's an addiction and should be treated
as such. As if that weren't bad enough, Verant's treatment of their
customer base is nothing short of ABUSIVE! Most people are aware of
this, but don't seem to mind grabbing their ankles so long as they get
their fix. Well, I for one am mercifully free of this crap and I will
NEVER again let myself get drawn into a game (or anything else) that
requires you sideline everything else in your life. I leave you all
with a little tid-bit I copied from Lum's website (lumthemad.net).
Just a little insight into the sort of people that create and control
EverQrack.  Suffice it to say, I will never purchase or own 
another Verant product again.

-------------Taken from lumthemad.net---------------
The UK version of Edge magazine has a look inside Sony Online
Enterainment, as well as some words from their CEO, Kelly Flock, and
boy did he have a few things to say.

The article, the first few paragraphs of which can be found here
<hyperlink not copied>, is a pretty standard look at a company growing
by leaps and bounds in the online entertainment industry. Then we get
to this (only available in the print version of the article): 

When asked if he takes into account consumer input Flock is
dismissive, relying instead on the expertise of his staff. "No, we
never talk to consumers they just fuck us up. Someone asked for a copy
of our market research which made us take the decision to do
EverQuest. I said we hadn't done any market research. Had we done, the
game would never have been made. We never focus on them. Gamers don't
know what they want. We just want to know if they have a valid credit
card." 

Well, hell. This explains a lot, doesn't it? No wonder customer
service has sucked harder than a Vegas prostitute with an Electrolux
attachment; the CEO of the bloody place thinks that we the customers
will only fuck them up. 

Er... Smed? Smed? You wanna try and explain this to us in a way that
us silly shits can understand?
