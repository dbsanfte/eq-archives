Oddly enough, I don't think I've ever paid less than 50.

But then, I don't screw around hedging by using the words "donation" in an
attempt to save a plat or two.  I correctly label it as buying a port, and
state in the auction how much I'm willing to pay.   And make it a high
enough amount that I've never had to wait long.

Of course, that might be a bit abnormal in that I never bought convencience
ports.   If it wasn't an emergency I wouldn't have been buying it.  For any
port that could wait a minute, three of my closest ingame friends played
druids.
