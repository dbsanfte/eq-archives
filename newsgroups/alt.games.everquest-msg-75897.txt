couple of questions?

1.  When you kick he punches also?
2.  When you start attacking does it say auto attack on?
3.  If you are in the default view mode and click on the "combat" button,
does it show melee attack being selected and unselected?
4.  Are you holding a torch or lantern in your primary hand?
