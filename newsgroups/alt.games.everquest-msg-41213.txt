And a lot of it is humanitarian too. If they don't want aid they can 
always decline it. As for the others, you're probably right we should 
not be doing some of the things we do. I know that and *most* of the 
American public knows that. We are truly well meaning for the most part. 
I wish our political leadership after World War II hadn't gained such a 
sense of self-rightousness. I'd like to point out that I didn't mean any 
other country ill-will. I meant that America should pretty much mind our 
own business and NOT meddle so much in others affairs. There are a lot 
of emotions going on inside me now.

Sure I feel for them. I also realize that they bring it on themselves 
for the most part. For example, most of the IRA bombings I've noted I've 
not really thought about. My only thoughts were "Why not just give NI to 
Eire and be done with it?" Granted I don't know the political or social 
ramifications of that statement... because I don't live there. I don't 
know the people. Yes I feel sorry for them.. but do I truly care what 
happens there? I'm sorry to say no.

Yes, that is probably true. And through diligence and (most likely luck) 
our FBI has foiled a few plots against us. You are absolutely correct 
that it was inevitable. I was FAR more shocked about Oklahoma City than 
this. Having lived here my whole life I could not (and still to this 
day) understand why an Amercian would attack his own country such as 
that. My statement is still correct - I don't want it happening here.

Yes, I am. An Army, Navy, Marine Corp, and Air Force built to defend us. 
Not an aid package to a foreign country who grooms their youth to hate 
and desire our blood. Or said package to be seized by corrupt leaders.. 
leading to resentment that the US government only cares for the rich and 
powerful. Let me ask you this.. how much has the British government (or 
the German, French, Italian or any other for that part) given to third 
world countries in foreign aid? I'm not asking for gratuitous thank 
you's. What I would like is to walk down the street without fear of 
being a "political statement".

No it doesn't. Yes we MAY be the most powerful. But I can name a half 
dozen countries with a larger military. The only "power" we have is 
really economic. Does that make us responsible for the rest of the 
world? I say not.

Good. I'm glad. And so am I.. at least about events in the United 
States.

And the problem with that? I don't want to understand the "issues 
involved in the middle east." I have enough to worry about right here in 
my own backyard thank you very much.

Why should they? Or more to the point why should we make them care? If 
they admire us I don't have a problem. Work in your own country to 
effect the freedoms we have here and we'll merrily co-exist as the 
United States and Britain (and Canada and Mexico and MOST of the rest of 
the "free" world) do.

Many thanks to you. I'd like to point out that my remarks above are 
about "political" caring. NOT humanitarian caring. If someone WERE 
killed in East Timor (etc.) I would care for the people themselves..NOT 
the cause or counter cause involved in the conflict (if that makes 
sense).

As I have been saying. But again, I don't like my country being blamed 
for perceived slights (real or imagined). Contrary to world opinion the 
President of the United States is NOT and NEVER will be a personality 
such as films and the like make him out to be. Regardless of party. He 
will NOT just "push the button" in this sort of event. He will be 
advised by his cabinet about what to do and what NOT to do. He will 
measure ALL responses and will (most likely) consult allies FIRST. God 
help us if the people of this country ever DO elect someone of that 
caliber. Then I WILL be scared.

Nor do I support genocide. Americans have fought and died fighting a 
genocidal regime. I for one would welcome a foreign policy review. I 
would like the US to move to a more isolationist viewpoint. And I 
believe Bush was moving us there slightly. I don't mean isolationist in 
pre WWII terms.. but a more "hands off" policy worldwide. Defend our 
interests but not meddle in other countries affairs. 

>

Not me. I'm positive that some here would call me a fool.. or that I 
have my head buried in the sand or probably twenty or thirty different 
viewpoints. All I can comment on are mine and mine alone.
