About the same.  I set up a Chat Line BBS back in 1988 or so.. It was
the first BBS in my area to provide full INTERNET Access.. I used CNET
of of an AMIGA 2000 with an O40...  Been doing USENET since about 1990
or so..

My comment about being new was directed at this particular group (ADH)
and not USENET in general.  My apologies for not being clearer...
