Hm, that brings to mind the middle ground version, which is even
more prone to abuse: letting players pay extra to raise the drop
rates on the mobs they kill, or the spawn rates on rare spawns,
etc.  So if you're having trouble camping the Great Whozis for
its Uber Paddle of Spanking, not only could they give you the
option of outright buying the item, but for a monthly fee you
could have all your rare spawns and rare drops become more likely.

And let's face it.  Even those of us who would never ever consider
buying items for RL cash, I'll bet we could be sorely tempted after
camping a spawn for a few hours.  "I've put in the time, gimme the
damned reward already!  Okay okay, I'll pay a few bucks just to let
this camp be over with!"  But I think it would be just as bad, for
the same reasons you suggest: people would suspect SOE of tweaking
down the spawn and drop rates for "standard price" customers in an
attempt to boost sales of "expedited" accounts.
