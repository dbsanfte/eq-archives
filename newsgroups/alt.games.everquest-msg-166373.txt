Indeed.  The problem has nothing to do with whether or not SOE has a
"roleplaying preferred" designation on one or more servers.  It has
to do with self-righteous sorts who always felt perfectly justified
in rejecting VI/SOE's attempts to encourage/enforce that particular
courtesy.  Only the rationalization du jour changed, there was no
effect I could see on anybody's behavior.
