This is the very stupid Gm "we just want to play" event. It is about
the most retarded thing done in Everquest (even more retarded than
what the players get up to) I really want to miss the extremely
deficient person who thought it up. It honestly makes no damn sense at
all. If you see this event, just leave the area since its just so god
damned dumb. 

Its taken place with mini giants and other creatures and now evidently
unicorns. Well meaning "roleplayers" or players in general have tried
to play with them to no avail with the gms sticking to their "we want
to play" retard script. I think somone got some kind of food or water
once for playing along. 

This is just a huge waste of a gm's time basically.
