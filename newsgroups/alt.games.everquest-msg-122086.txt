Hardly failed.  The population actually seems to have grown recently,
started even before they threatened to nerf the one char per account.
The biggest problem with TLC, as I see it, is that it would simply be
an economicly unjustifiable effort to go through the entire item
database while also reviewing all quests so that individual items
could be flagged as TLC or not as appropriate.  So instead they just
whacked it with the big stick they had handy, and made a few special
adjustments on a case by case basis (mostly by making a handful of
items NODROP).  In spite of this, I still mostly like TLC.

I'd be surprised to learn that there aren't a couple already in play.

For that matter, I'm quite certain that there are guilds that have
several accounts used to acquire quest bits off of low level mobs
for their members.  It is such an obvious thing to do if you wish to
minimize your dependence on "outsiders" that it is simply beyond
belief that it would not have been done repeatedly already.  Wouldn't
surprise me a bit if many of the lowbies were actually being leveled
up to be tough enough to survive fetching things that their "uber"
sponsors were already too high to get on their own.
