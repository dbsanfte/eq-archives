There is a huge difference, which is why as soon as I see
John "whining incessantly", I'll join you in suggesting that
he might be happier moving on to another game.

However, until then, while his posts continue to be good,
measured, well-reasoned and well-explained accounts of
what he thinks could be done better in the game, I'll have
to object to your incessant pestering, cry-babyish outbursts
over the fact that he dares express an opinion that apparently
differs from your own.

If anyone's whining in this exchange, it is clearly you.
"Mmooooommmmm, John's critiquing the game again, make
him sttooooopppp!"

So try a taste of your own medicine:

  Fine. Stop reading John's posts, then. Go read something else.
  Otherwise, quit your bitchin'. If seeing his posts while you
  browse this newsgroup spoils it that much for you, go
  find another forum.

There now, see how obnoxious that is when the shoe's on
the other foot?
