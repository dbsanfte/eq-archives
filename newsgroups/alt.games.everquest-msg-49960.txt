At level 17 you get one of your most important abilities "Feign
Death". At 18 you get "Instill Doubt".

All of your combat skills will go up as you fight. The following 3
skills are a pain to raise:

Mend (6 minute timer)
Feign Death (10 second timer)
Instill Doubt (10-15? second recycle)

Using your practice points to "jumpstart" the above skills is not a
bad idea.

Cheers
