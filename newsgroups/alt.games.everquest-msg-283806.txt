I;m getting the feeling you don;t really understand they group dynamic
here.

A necro can stay alive and kill of the mob even if everyone else dies.
So his goal is to make sure he lives.  Not only is he capable of that
task as a class but he's also frequently the corpse puller in the case
of an almost wipe, almost meaning everyone but him.

Necro's fight, in their own way.  They don't tank but they are far
more effective killers than a tank will ever be.  Everyone has a role,
not all of them are to support the tank or cleric...
