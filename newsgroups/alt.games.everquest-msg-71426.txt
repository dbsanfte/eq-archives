Installed my new SB Audigy.  Or course, no problems except in EQ.

The first time I logged on, I wasn't able to hear any sounds except when 
other people got hit in battle or when I jumped.  I could -barely- hear a 
spell being cast if I were right next to it.

Last night, I couldn't even hear the jumping, just when other people got 
hit in battle.  I couldn't hear anything when I got hit, either day.

Besides messing with the acceleration sliders, do you veteran SB Live and 
Audigy people know of any tricks to get some sound going?  Besides slapping 
my AWE 64 Gold back in or buying something different...
