Is there any zoning in WoW?  I had thought that going from Tedrassil to 
the main Alliance continent involved quick zoning, since to get to the 
place with the birds and boats, you go through a portal.  It loads very 
fast, but I thought they might have hidden zoning in there.

However, yesterday I found a place where I could go over the rim of 
seemingly impassable mountains that block the edges of Tedrassil, and 
fell to my death.  (It is a *long* fall...Tedrassil is very high!).  
When I went back in ghost form, rather than getting my corpse, I jumped 
off the branch I had fallen to, and fell quite a ways more, and landed 
in the sea, where I was able to swim around to the place where the birds 
and boats are, so that is NOT in another zone like I had thought.
