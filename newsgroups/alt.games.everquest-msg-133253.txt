I was thinking the other day about the group bonus.  Does the character
have to be in the zone with you in able to get the group bonus?  Say
could a bunch of guildies group together in one zone, and have the sixth
person go into another zone and solo or maybe be PLed and that person
still get the grouping bonus plus all the exp?
