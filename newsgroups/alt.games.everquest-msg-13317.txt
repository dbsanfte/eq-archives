Okay, last attempt, it tried to break up the log. Darn Agent. As I was
saying, I haven't even read this myself yet. One of the guys from
Conquest sent it to me. I'll post it to let ya'll read it as well.
I'll get it read eventually. I don't even know what it says. Someone
else might be kind enough to edit for highlights... From the skim, it
appears the guy didn't even start logging until after everyong got
pulled to the areana, so it may be moot... Anyway:
