I wonder how many great people who just happened to be away from the
keyboard or too busy with something to answer you have ended up in
your ignore list.

I'd have to say that every one of them is damn lucky - I know that *I*
wouldn't want to find myself grouped with someone so small-minded.

Unless you've got a damn good reason for it, you try that in a group
I'm running and you're the one who goes. I don't limit who I play with
based on someone else's petty emotional problems.
