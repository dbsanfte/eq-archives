Dreadlands.  The abandoned city over by the portals is full of easy to
kill undead although some of them will probably be deep red so you
might need a partner for a few more levels if you get unlucky.

Yetis in the caves along the wall of the snow covered area are also
very easy although you'll have to be careful of where they flee to
when wounded.
