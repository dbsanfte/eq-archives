people are not going to visit a zone just cuz of a revamp..maybe old
timers would go to see the upgrade, but that wouldbe good for one maybe
two visits. people primarily go to zones to hunt or do quests.

I dont know why SOE is spending dollars on updating older zones that
has little traffic. the only time i go to freeport is to get to pok
stone and run to ldon camp.  unless they are going to revamp the mobs
(ala mistmoore and splitpaw). but i cant see them doing that for a
whole city..unless it going to turn alliance ( ala fironia vie).

as they add more expansions and more zones..maintaining the old zones
is a problem..what do you do wit them all? why are they even needed? I
can see SOE doing the following:

1. figure out the top 25 zones (pok, dl, pc, dsp, kurns, wos, etc).
this might change  month by month
2. make an "eq-express" that has connections only between these 25
zones
3. put all the other zones accessible via a pull down menu so people
can get to them for quests, npcs, etc. via a single click

would be another step in moving away from eq's original roots, but
would make it easier for the casual player.
