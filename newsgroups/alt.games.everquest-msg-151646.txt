Bit of a hard call since you cannot look at the graphics subsystem on it's
own, you have to look at it as a part of the overall system. There is no use
throwing a GF4TI into a Celeron 800 256MB PC100 Ram system or even a GF2TI
in a 2Ghz 512MB+ DDR box.

I have been playing musical graphical cards for a little while on a "decent"
(but not great...) system and have noticed marked performance
increases/decreases along the way.

My system is as follows:

AMD Thunderbird 1200MHz  CPU.
768MB PC133 Kingmax Ram. (note: non DDR hence a major bottleneck)
SB Audigy with 4+1 Digital Surround Sound  speakers.
Cable Internet.

And I have been using the following graphics cards in the last month:

GF3 TI 200 64mb - Asus
GF2 MX 32mb - Winfast.
GF 4 TI 4200 (?) 64mb - Winfast.

Going back from the GF3 TI 200 to the GF2 MX was majorly noticable with
extreme performance hits and resulted in very long zone times, especially
into the Bazaar. I also started getting a lot more crashing on zoning into
the Bazaar as well. Putting the GF 3 TI into a similar spec'ed machine to
mine but based on DDR memory caused it's performance to go through the roof.
It really kicked ass over the performance my machine got out of that card.

So then I put the GF4 Ti into my non-DDR based machine and it of course
restored it to previous GF3 TI standards, maybe a bit better, it is a close
call. The DDR based machine with the GF3 TI still outperforms my box with
the GF4 TI though. DDR system memory really does play a huge role in such a
memory intensive (and non-optimised) program like EQ.
