Thanks bud, I'll  do just that ) For the rest of you smug wankers that
reckon I'm an asshole/idiot whatever for being pissed about not getting any
tech support for my coin, well screw you - I wonder if your attitude would
be any different if you'd not been able to play for a few months while VI
quite happily debit your credit card. Oh BTW, I meant the eqops techs and
not the GMs, most GMs or guides I've encountered actually attempt to help. I
wonder if you professional flamers have any EQ chars over level 30
considering the amount of time you spend rubbishing posters in this
newsgroup. I have a problem that VI for all intents and purposes, have
ignored or stored away as "too difficult" so I vent my spleen here - get
over it - that's part of what this newsgroup is about.
Sean yer a gem :)

Phil.
