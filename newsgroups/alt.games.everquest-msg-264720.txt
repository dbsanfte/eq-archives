OK, I'll take a closer look in a bit, if the servers are back up.
Lucky they got shut down - I grabbed 4 hours sleep.          :)

Actually I can't do anything, until I complete my citizenship...

Must gather wood while I'm in the bog - I need furniture for me room.

Talking of room - I LOVE the customisation you can do. Only 2 types of
wood panelling to choose from in my hovel, but I'm *assuming* you get
more choices as your situation improves ?  ie, as you get bigger
houses, you can choose from polished wood, marble, etc ?

Bunnies aren't just cute like everybody supposes !
They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
Bunnies !  Bunnies !  It must be BUNNIES !
