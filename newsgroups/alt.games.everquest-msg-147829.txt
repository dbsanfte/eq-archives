Funny how things work out sometimes.  I have a cleric on quellious,
too.  I started EQ this year, and I would come to this newsgroup to
read up on cleric strategies.  Frequenly, I would see a Quindell post
on exactly the information I was seeking.  I even ran across you a few
times in EQ.  So what happened to Quindell?  You play him much
anymore?  Frankly, I'm burned out on the cleric class (a *gasp* is
heard from Berg's army of clerics)
