While I'm far from having the final pet :) I personally don't normally
bring out my skellebuddy because he's so freaking eager to go after the
first thing that hits me.  I expect I'll summon one more often once I
have the AA that lets me tell him *SIT*STAY*GOOD BONES*, but for now
it's mostly only used in areas where it's not as likely to come back
with some new friends if it decides to go walkabout.
