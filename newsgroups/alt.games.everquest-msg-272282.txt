What's the best way to make money in this game? I see people my
levelling riding horse but I don't have anything like that amount of
money in my bank.

So, do people get their money from adventuring or crafting? And if so
which line of crafting. Someone mentioned alchemy as a good moneymaker.
I know everyone needs washes/resin etc but surely you can buy them from
the NPC seller? Plus having an alt to make it isn't too hard for
people to do.
