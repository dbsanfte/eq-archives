It's Mensa, not MENSA - it's not an acronym, rather it is the latin word 
for table (because they're supposed to be a round table society).

I used to be in Mensa, and it is a very odd society. I joined it after 
leaving Uni as a way to meet new people etc when the glut of student 
societies, trips to the student union etc, were replaced with the daily 
grind of work and seeing the same old people day in day out. Treated like a 
big drinking club it was OK, but perhaps 90% of its members don't go to any 
of the social events and just join because they think it's big to leave 
their Mensa magazine lying around on their coffee table or something to 
show all their friends how clever they are - very strange.

They have a huge cross section of different people as members since the 
only thing anyone has in common is a high score on an IQ test. Lets face 
it, IQ isn't a measure of intelligence, it is just a measure of your 
ability to do IQ tests. I know some very stupid people in Mensa.

I let my membership lapse eventually because they don't actually provide a 
great deal in return for the membership fee.

A friend of mine probably had the biggest return on being a Mensan when he 
bought an old Sinclair C5 at a jumble sale (yes, the ill-fated electric 
trike with the washing machine motor). He was fixing it up and was 
frequenting internet messageboards and mailing lists and stuff for C5 
enthusiasts, who seemed to do nothing but argue the toss about 
insignificant little details (why did they use this particular sprocket 
doohicky when they designed it etc). He got to tell them 'oh, I'll be going 
for a drink with Sir Clive Sinclair next week, do you want me to ask him?', 
thus granting him instant godhood status with a bunch of sad internet 
geeks...
