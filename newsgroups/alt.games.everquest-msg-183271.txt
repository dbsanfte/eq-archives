Well, messed with the Cartography system for a little bit.  It appears
its going to be quite time consuming to make a map of the new zones,
not to mention all the other zones that we already had.

I was a little disappointed that the system wasn't like others I have
enjoyed, mapping out the are I have visited, rather than the present
system of walking the border of the zone clicking make point at each
change in the border...  ensuring I click end line when walking across
a hall....  And hell, I cant seem to make the Remove line work.  (made
quite a few boo boos......)

So, anyone heard of a group that intends to publish the maps... 
Yeah Yeah, save the smart ass comments about  JEEZ it was just
released yesterday...   I asked "anyone heard of a group that INTENDS
to publish the maps.

good hunting to you all, oh and if you got any tips on clearing up my
map mistakes... please feel free to pass them this way.
