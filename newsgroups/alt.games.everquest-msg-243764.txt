Yes, I think you'll find the new challenges mostly fun, more fun than
frustrating, I don't want to paint too negative a picture. There's a reason
I'm there EVERY gaming minute that I'm not raiding.

I think that you will want to get it as soon as you can in order to become
familiar the layout and start some of the many quests. But clearly the real
fun (the trials) will require your hitting 65 and getting some AA's and
gear. As for whether yours is one of the diminished classes, I think that
Mages provide significant contribution in any of the first six trials.

In the sewers, for example, trial 2 can be easily won by one of two methods.
The objective is to collect 4 specific drops (skulls) off random mobs while
fighting toward a final room. When you enter that room with the 4 skulls 4
named ghosts appear that must be killed. As they are killed they turn into
wisps which then float back to a home point in another part of the dungeon.
When all 4 wisps return to this room, a named NPC spawns and the 4 skulls
must be turned into her in order to get the flag. The problem is, you have
30 minutes before she will despawn and it's a bit of a fight along the way.
Unlike LDoNs, mobs in GoD trials respawn fairly quickly 10-15 mins so you
will have to fight your way back to the npc spawn point for the turn in, and
do it within 30 minutes. The first method involves giving the skulls to an
SOS Rogue who just heads right back to the spawn point of the NPC and waits
for the wisps to arrive. The room is full of see-invis ghosts that will rip
apart anyone approaching the npc, but the Rogue is able to stealth and wait.
When the NPC pops, the Rogue simple turns in the skulls with nimble and
escape if necessary, or just dies. But everyone gets flagged.

The 2nd method involves taking the party to the spawn point of the NPC,
clearing the room and setting up a Mage in a safe spot while the rest of the
team makes it way to the named ghosts at the other end of the map. Once all
4 ghosts are dead and the wisps are on their way, the Mage coths the party
back and they simple clear and turn in. I've won this mission both ways.

Actually, the difficult nature of corpse retreivals in GoD trials has
*significantly* enhanced the value of Necros in the party and for some of
the same reasons, Mages with their abilty to coth the party provide some
advantage. I've taken many mages through sewers and mountain trials.
Frankly, however, I don't think Mages are going to make the holy-trinity
style cuts for many people planning Ikkinz trials in Kod'Taz.

Fortunately, there's a lot of content you will have access to between sewer
trial 1 and mountain 2, that'll keep you busy with great experience and loot
for some time before you confront the awkward realities in Kod'Taz. Perhaps
by then they'll have been addressed.

Ah, ok in that sense there is no scaling. The mobs appear to be randomly
distributed but consistenly of the same level and number whether you are one
person alone or a full party of six, and irrespective of the party levels.
Unlike ldon, you can have any number between 1-6 in your party and may
freely swap them in and out mid-mission. This helps to allow necros to come
into your instance and summon a corpse, for example, and then exit out.

Yep, and the current situation perfectly illustrates their uncanny ability
to swing too far in one direction.

It will be much better in the raiding environment where 54 people can
participate. The trick is getting to that point. I don't like getting
dragged, I'd prefer to pull my own weight but for now that's pretty much my
only option. Through the grace of my guild and friends I will eventually get
flagged for the Ikkinz trials, but it won't be until after they've made
their groups out of more needed classes and learned the dungeons and the
tricks so that I can be sponsored through. Needless to say, I don't like
this system. As one of the very first non-guilded players to walk into
Kod'Taz on my server, I pushed real hard to earn that right and it's
frustrating as hell now to be sitting on the sidelines once there.

> Not my idea of how to build a game enviroment.

Nor mine. It's one of the reasons I spend more time daily reading the WoW
forums than these. I can honestly say, however, that the journey to this
point has been fun as hell. ;-)
