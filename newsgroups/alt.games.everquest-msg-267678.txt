LOL, there's a quest in Qeynos where you have a choice of turning in stolen 
goods to the guards or taking it back to the smuggler.  Figuring that 
Qeynos is the home of the goodytwoshoes I turned in the goods to the guard 
and got a nice bag for it, if I had taken the goods to the smuggler, I 
would have only recieved 22c.
