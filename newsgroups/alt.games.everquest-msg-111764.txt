Ok, I can see two readings for this.

1)  Primative because they're from the arabian culture.  Problem is, at the
time, the arabs (and even more so, the moors) were possibly the most
advanced civilization in the world.  Unfortunatly, they stagnated after
that.

2)  Primative, as in it's curved blade makes it easier to use.  This also
doesn't hold true.  Take a look at the katana-to or the wakazashi.  The
curve in the blade actually has signifcance.  The curve is an arc of the
circle who's radius is the bushi's arm.  This means that drawing the sword
out of the scabbard involves only one motion, and very little resistance.

Many kenjutsus, such as Iado involve the swordsman standing with the sword
sheathed.  The swordsman would draw his sword and strike in one blow.  The
curved blade (as described above) would allow a higher blade speed apon
impact, giving a deeper cut.  Also, instead of the blade being impeaded by
the increasing angle of incidence with the target, the katana blade would
maintain a relatively constant tangent, allowing it to glide smoothly
through it's path, cutting deeper all the way.

Anou.... I'm rambling, I think.
