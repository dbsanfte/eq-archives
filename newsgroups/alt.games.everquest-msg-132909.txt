Yes.  But rune has a component.  Rune III will usually suffice, but that's 
about 1pp per pull... The better, safe, Runes IV and V use a peridot.  If 
you think I'm spending 10pp every time I pull you're delusional. :)  Berz 
Str is usually a far better option, no component, but doesn't last very 
long, and the recast time is just long enough to be scary.
