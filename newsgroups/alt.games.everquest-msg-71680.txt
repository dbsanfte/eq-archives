I think Verant missed a bet here, they should have admitted that their whole
binding system was a mistake and made a "/bind" command that only works in
areas that are already melee bindable.  So that pure casters maintain their
monopoly on binding anywhere, and melee characters can set their home city
without having to beg a someone else to drop what they are doing and bind
them.

The truth is I am the only sane person in the entire world; there just
aren't enough strait-jackets to go around for the rest of the world, so
they're trying to put me in one.
