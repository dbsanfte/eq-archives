Windows 2000 may not crash on you, but it does on me, often. Crashes 
aside, what about the abundance of security exploits for Windows 2000? 
What about the fact that you are forced to load Internet Explorer 
because Microsoft want market share? What about Windows XP's Media 
Player "feature" which lets Microsoft know what and when you are doing 
with Media Player?

You give an example which is very dated. Have you used Star/Open Office 
lately? Have you used Wordperfect lately?  They are very good and 
feature what I consider all the good things about MS Word, but without 
all the bloatware.
