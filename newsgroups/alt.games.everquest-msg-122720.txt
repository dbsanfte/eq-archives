Generally accepted is when you come into a zone, you ooc a Camp Check.
Then you don't bother with anything that someone claims as a camp.

Of course the flip side of this is that you don't claim anything you can't keep
clear.

If in your example you claim geonids, then I don't want to run up the geonid
tunnel and find that you have 4 geos up.  In that case you are really only
camping the bottom four geos (or top four or something) and could easily
share without hurting your kills per hour rate.

Further, you should either a) have a list so people who want to join a camp
can do so as space opens up or b) be willing to notify the "next group" when
your group is leaving a camp.  Both of these options are less universally
supported than the Camp Claim idea.

What you shouldn't be expected to do is what you have been doing,
and what the PnP demands, and that is share a spawn you can clear
by yourself (yourself being either just you or your group, whatever the
claiming body is)  Sharing a spawn you can clear means wasting your
time, cutting your kills per hour in half, whether you are there for
exp or for loot this pretty much eliminates the camp as functional.  Share
only spawns you can't clear.  If a mob pops every five minutes but you
can only kill him once every ten, then he's perfect to share with someone
of similar capabilities.  (similarly in your example if your  group can only
handle 4 of the 8 geo's, giving the second group the other four is no
skin off your nose)

These people aren't a part of the majority, have no sense of the general
rules the comunity of EQ players have developed, and further may be
violating verant policy by threatening to train you.  While there wouldn't
be any recourse for you if they went thru and tried to be the first to tag
every geo that pops, training is actionable.

I['m not familiar with the Tunare server,but I suspect that you've just run
across a string of jerks, there will always be a few of these but most
people across most servers have more respect for others and for the
community rules that we've developed over time than to try this sort
of unmitigated crap
