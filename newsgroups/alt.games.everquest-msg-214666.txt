Shaman are not druids.  REpeat, NOT druids.  Not getting hit is not an important
option for a class with decent AC, Slow, lots of regen, lots of HP.  Further,
shaman get a pet that does decent damage (particularly with Haste and stat
buffs) but that tanks fairly poorly; put the shaman in front of the mob and the
pet on the other side, though, and you get quite decent damage output (from pet)
and decent tanking (from shaman) in one soloing package.

My shaman has SOW anytime he wants it, via clicky boots, but is normally not
only not SOWed, but actually moving at snared speed, due to having Stoicism
constantly on (thats a great mana ratio HOT that has the down sides of snaring
and slowing you)

Further, even if you play a hands off, no contact style shaman, HP are still
your most important stat.  This is because of Cannibalism; you hit yourself for
damage but get mana for it, then regen or heal yourself; in a contradiction of
the laws of conservation of energy, you get more mana per HP casting canni than
it costs to heal the HP back.  So you are constantly spending HP.  The more you
have, the deeper your pool when you need it.  But in addition to a deeper pool,
whatever HP you have left over while doing canni is what you have if you are
getting hit.  This means that HP is doubly important to a shaman.

Shaman also function as slowers.  While there's nothing much a druid has to cast
thats important to land right away, the shaman is often called on to slow a mob
ASAP, often on incoming.  This means that he's often going to end up with aggro,
especially since failed slow seems to enrage mobs more than successful ones;
aggro from an unslowed mob that he's actively pissing off more by trying the
slow again!  In latter levels, a shaman may be taking hits that would kill your
average druid in one round.

SoW can't be cast indoors, and there are few spells a shaman has that can't be
cast there other than that one; shaman are called on to go indoors all the
time.  SoW wears off soon enough for anyone indoors, but sooner still for
shaman, who cast Stoicism (later Torpor) on themselves with amazing regularity,
and that spell overwrites SoW.  I'd expect a SoW on an indoor shaman to last
about 5 minutes on average, and most of that because the shaman was waiting for
everyone else to zone in before getting started.

You won't have snare for the mob, this means that aggro kiting requires a lot
more room, leaves a lot less room for error.  Also, live melee have a very hard
time hitting an unsnared mob in an aggro kite, since keeping the mob in melee
position is problematic.  Now if you have a snarer in the group, thats another
story, of course.  But the shaman still shouldn't be the bait in the kite; he's
capable of generating lots of mana by casting canni if he can stand still, and
keeping his HP total up by healing, again he needs to stand still for that,
later he'll be using Stoicism or Torpor for even better ratio healing, but that
will snare him to the point that he won't be able to play bait for even a snared
mob.

There are advantages to SoW, but a shaman sacrifices a lot more for them than a
ranger or druid would.  On the other hand, there are advantages to playing
sponge (letting mobs beat on you) but a shaman gets a lot more out of them than
a druid or ranger.  Better still, with a ranger or druid partner, the shaman can
even make use of the partner's DS to get still more milage out of being beat
upon!
