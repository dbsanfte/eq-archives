My vote for wizards is the level 4 spell Fade.  The spell decription should
read something like this:

Causes caster to waste valuable time that could be spent running to guards
trying in vain to get his or her sad channeling skills to work.  Should the
spell miraculously channel through, it will buy the caster less time than
was wasted casting the spell to begin with.  This spell teleports the user a
maximum of 10 feet, and the monster gets to automatically know where the
caster appeared and land a couple "sucker punches" before the unfortunate
player can get his or her bearings.

Of course, it may have some use in PvP.  I refer only to how it's used in
PvE.
