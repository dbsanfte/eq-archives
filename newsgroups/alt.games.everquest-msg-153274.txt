This is like the guildies in my group who say "can someone come pick
me up and port me to xxxx?" a million times and wonder why nobody's
responding.  I was horrified the day a paladin asked someone to come
get him in Paludal, port him to NK or EK, and *escort him* to HHK.  A
few days later, I had a brain aneurism when he was offering 110pp for
someone to buy his level such and such spells and bring them to him in
HHK, because he didn't know how to get to Rivervale.  The day after
*that*, when we were throwing around the idea of a low level raid
somewhere, his contribution was "can it be somewhere someone can port
me?"

Ryou
(went on a bit of a rant about that one in guilt chat, actually...)
