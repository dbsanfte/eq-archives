It depends on how you counter someone's arguements. Given DTs posting
style (inability to admit when he's wrong, confrontational when
there's no need) , the fact that people get frustrated and take cheap
shots at him really isn't surprising to me. 

I'm sure I'd do the same thing on occasion if he weren't in my
killfile, I too find him a terribly annoying individual.
