Does anyone know any good chat rooms to meet traders in EQ2. I know I could
use the merchant system but that means leaving my guy logged in when i'm not
on.

Are there any trade specfic message boards/chat rooms.

I have around 4 adept 1 books not useful to me that I am looking to trade
for predator adept books. I also have a 'triple shot' adept book, but i'm
keeping that for when I become a ranger :-)
