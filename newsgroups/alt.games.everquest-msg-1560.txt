Over time, people have started to (often correctly) associate
"d00d-speak" with idiots and clueless twinks that are d00ds with no real
appreciation for their class. Enough of these types of people have
mistakenly used "Rouge" instead of rogue, that Rogue twinks are now
often called "Rouges" on purpose. It implies that the "Rouge" is an
idiot, a twink, and a power-levelling d00d with a Burning Rapier and a
hide skill of 15. :) "Rouge" also implies an association between rouge
(facial beauty product) and the fact that thise d00d twinks are all
looks and no substance. It is a nice correlation.

So, people often use "Rouge" on purpose when referring to this type of
player.

Just figured I would spell it out.
