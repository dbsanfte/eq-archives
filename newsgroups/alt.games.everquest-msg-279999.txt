Hi all
I am lvl 63 necro at EQ1
When I was annoyed by mobs resisting my spell - especially darkness(snare),
experienced toon gave me an advice to lower my charisma and it will stick
better.
She has been very good adviser to me so I believe it but I just don't see
how charisma could related to spell resistance if it is not charm spell.
And someone told me if I get closer to mob and cast spell, there is less
opportunity that mob would resist my spell.

Is that all true? Anyone can tell me how to make it better that mob doesn't
resist my spell?
