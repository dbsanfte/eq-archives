Never seen the problem, so other than taking an alternate route, I don't 
have any suggestions.  Depending on which expansions you have there are 
several options.  Click on book to PoK, click on book to Freeport if you 
have PoP.  Luclin spires in Gfay, then spires down to NK if you have SoL.  
Otherwise, find a druid or wizard to port you.
