Now hold on here.  I appreciate your support Ben, but you're
mischaracterizing my responses here.  (And this isn't simply to chastize
you, it's to change the presumptions of anyone who may continue this
discussion)

Yes, I was mild, especially considering that I'm not the slightest bit
reserved to fling insults when someone presents an argument that I find
contemptible.  But I was not hostile in this thread.  Not even after
Rumbledor had his "total meltdown" as you described it. (Ok, maybe when I
implied that he was being a chickenshit, I was hostile for a moment, but I
consider that pretty pedestrian considering that I had been called "Captain
Asshole" in the message I was responding to, and yes, there were some
adverbs thrown in there that weren't particularly nice)  I used the example
of his brother using the excess time to cyber Floyd not to insult his
brother (I don't even know, nor do I care, if Rumble has a younger brother)
but because I wanted to use an example that Rumble wouldn't approve of.
He'd have to say that he preferred paying his brother to have cyber sex with
a (possibly male) halfling, because he got the spider silks that he wanted.
This only weakened the point he was attempting to make, that he was
rejecting the "time investment" that was fulfilled in the other example of
the incompetent brother who was farming spider silks in the wrong zone, but
spent the appropriate amount of time doing it.  It makes his opinion just
that much more difficult to defend.   He'd rather pay his brother to cyber a
halfling than pay for "the time investment" that he was originally proposing
the transaction was all about; was *only* about.

That he might take offense to that was purely an unintended consequence of
the example, but then, if he was going to be insulted by that, I have to
admit that I didn't particularly give a shit.
