Depends on the type of add.  At 34 I was working on my quadding style at the
crazed gobs in Butcherblock.  No adds there ... nothing to worry about.

When I moved to the Ulthork tree in EW, things changed.  When I got adds
there, the majority of the time it was a walrus.  For that reason, I always
kept my highest lvl "Fear Animal" spell memmed ... fear the incoming
flopper, then pull my quad the other way.  By the time the fear wore off,
the flopper was either so far away that it had forgotten about me, or I'd
get a faction hit message while medding indicating that someone else had
killed it.

But even when I'm just playing taxi, I never ... ever ... go anywhere
without Root memmed.  You never know when you (or your passenger) might need
something stopped in it's tracks.
