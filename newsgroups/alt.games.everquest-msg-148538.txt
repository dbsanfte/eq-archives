It would seem that shadowknights (even sub 60) are stronger soloists than I
previously gave them credit for as well.  I was in Burning Wood the other
day and watched a blue to me shadowknight and his green to me pet kill a
wurm with no outside help.  Took a long time, but the shadowknight's snare
plus fear plus beating the wurm on the back seem to be 20 times as mana
efficient as wizzie nukes.  Not complaining here, as I am happy with my
char's lot in life, but I can plainly state that that blue con shadowknight
killed a monster that would have run me oom before it chased me to zone.
