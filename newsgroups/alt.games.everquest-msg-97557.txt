From what I see of the new SoL encounters, I expect that BLs will be very 
good at off-tanking unmezzable adds.  While that doesn't seem like a great 
advantage, there are enough mobs that can't be controlled by normal means 
that this may be a very useful thing to bring to a raid.  (Think Ring of 
Fire type encounters.)
