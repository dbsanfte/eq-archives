First, it is illegal to steal music.  Period.  There is no gray
area.  You download music from the Internet rather than buy the
CD that a musician/band has worked hard to make, you're a thief.
That's a stone-cold fact.

However... the music industry is totally clueless as to how to
respond.  This idea of making ISPs conspirators in the illegal
trade of music is as ridiculous as saying that AT&T is guilty
of aiding someone calling in a bomb threat.

I won't claim to have an answer, or even a clue, to the problem
of copyright infringement.  But it's fun watching someone even
MORE clueless than me (i.e., the music industry) spin wildly with
half-baked ideas.
