    I'll assume you meant to say "no apparent use for it".

    The two guilds we compete with have been busy since PoP came out. One
guild went to Vex Thal for the first time, and swept through it. It's a much
easier place when you can mez almost every mob, have extra levels and bonus
damage tables/defensive tables/inherent resists, Taunt works almost 100% on
everything there, you have extra HPs from PoP buffs, etc.

    The other guild killed Seru for the first time on the server, and now
farms him. They also killed Emperor for their first time, when they'd never
got him below 70% before. All the things I mentioned above, and a 40%
disease resist-based slow, sure helped them!

    These guilds had never been able to do these things before. Now they
can, and they're scooping up the loot which prepares them for higher-tier
planes in PoP. Your guild sounds around the HoT-level - imagine how fast
you'll be geared up in HoT armour if your high level players are going there
to XP. And they will.

    No, they attempted to make it so players wouldn't XP in older zones,
with a few exceptions. Farming is getting easier than ever. The ONLY THING
preventing guilds like mine from going back and scooping up every high-end
mob in older expansions is the race to get ourselves flagged ahead of the
competition. It's all the busywork, not the fact that we'd need to clear
green mobs to get to targets, that keeps us away.

    Quite the opposite. Getting to 65 would make easy mobs that previously
were quite difficult for you. The only thing that changes is where you get
XP - you'd likely put an end to your soloing days. That could make a
significant difference in whether or not you could get AA points.
