I do know for a while that people were easily earning 5k a night from
swirling shadow farming from newbie mobs in ST which on reflection
does seem unreasonable.  As you mention in your other post perhaps

I haven't heard if they have reduced the drop rate in Twilight Sea but
on past form it wouldn't be a shock.
