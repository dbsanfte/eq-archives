I bought mine in Neriak. I don't think it is available anywhere else (at least
that is what I had read/been told); but that might not be true. It is possible
to buy the spell in Neriak even if you are KoS and don't have an evil race
illusion. Just use invis to get to the library and gate out once you have
purchased the spell. Nothing will kill you if invis holds till you get there and
you don't move around too much. I've been there with both my Tunare worshipping
wood elf druid and a level 8 high elf chanter (agnostic, but unillusioned) and
had no problems. If you've never been to Neriak, make a new dark elf character
and learn your way around the city first though, before you try running through
invis with your KoS "real" character.

Start with the least expensive gem that you can, and work up to more expensive
stones as the cheaper ones go trivial.

I don't believe I have ever seen a player selling the inexpensive gems. You
might as well resign yourself to buying from the merchants. Alternatively,
bandits (level 9-15ish mobs) sometimes drop them, and the evil eyes (25ish? not
sure at all about the level on these guys) in the Gorge of King Xxorb drop them
frequently.

There really is little or no market for silver jewelry. You might sell some
jasper (wis), star rose quartz (int), or amber (str) rings to newbies; but you
won't make your investment back by any means.

I hate to rain on the parade, but I would suggest you simply forget about
skilling jewelry up until you are much higher level. Unless you are a twink
whose main is supporting the learning process with liberal doses of cash, it's
really too expensive to raise until your bank account becomes quite healthy.
Cash in the early levels is much better spent on spells and equipment. Like all
trade skills in EQ, it is very doubtful you'll ever make it pay for itself. My
enchanter has a skill of 202 and she has certainly spent *far* more money
getting to that level than I ever expect her to make back (although it is fun
and in character for a chanter to be able to make jewelry, I must admit. /grin)

That said, the cheapest way to raise jewelry skill is to have your intelligence
maxxed (makes you learn faster) and to start with the least expensive stone you
can get. Move up to more expensive stones as the cheaper ones go trivial. Don't
bother enchanting the metal unless you are making something you might be able to
sell to players. It's usually a waste of time and mana to enchant the cheap
stuff; players won't buy it and merchants won't pay much more for enchanted
stuff vs. non magical pieces. Just sell the items you make back to a merchant
who likes you (one you have good faction with, with your chr as high as you can
get it and faction raising spell for good measure.)

Have a look at http://www.eqtraders.com/ for more details on trade skills and
how to raise them. It's a great site.

Good luck
