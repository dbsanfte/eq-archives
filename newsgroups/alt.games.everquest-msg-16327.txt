One thing you need to learn to do (and it is even more necessary
at higher levels) is to "hold back" on nuking something until the
tanks in your group have done a decent amount of damage to the
creature.

*THEN* you can turn it into a smoldering pile of ashes.

If you start nuking too soon, the amount of damage you've done
quickly to the monster "up front" will exceed the small amount that
the tanks have done so far, and thus the monster will "hate"
you more than anyone else (since it "sees" you as it's biggest
threat).  So it will spend practically the entire fight
trying to eat you.

However, if you hold off for a while, your nukes will not exceed
the total amount that the tanks have done to it so far, and thus
you can (generally) nuke it from afar without making it immediately
run at you and start ripping your head off.

At higher levels, it's not uncommon for the Wizard to spend the
entire first half of the fight calmly meditating, then when the monster's
down to about half health, he/she stands up, delivers one big
nuke, and *BANG*, the monster falls dead, fight over.

Not only is it impressive :-), but it also keeps the monster
off the Wizard, gives the Wizard plenty of time to meditate for
the next fight, *and* still cuts in half the amount of time/damage
that the tanks would have spent/taken wihout a friendly Wizard
in the group.

Even at lower levels, this technique will help your less
experienced groupmates to "see" how much you're helping, when
it's not as obvious if you do your nuking "up front" to
"soften up" the creature.
