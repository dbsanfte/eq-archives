There's the antique quests in POK, start in the museum, collect 4 items,
combine & turn in for a focus effect 2.

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16371 costs maybe 50-100
plat in bazaar for mana pres 2.

I dont know how easy the others are but there's burning affliction, improved
healing, enhancement haste, spell haste, summoning afficiency, and extended
range items.
