I'm not trying to start an argument, but I am trying to understand
your reply. Well, Christianity didn't exist until after Christ was
crucified. And he was jewish. I don't see how it can be an insult to
say Jesus was jewish. Hmm. I'm not saying you are one, but the only
folks who I've seen get very upset upon 'learning' that Jesus was
jewish are usually far right fundies. Many of them I've encountered
over the years were very prejudiced and don't like Jews, or just
about anyone else for that matter. They don't like being reminded
that Jesus was jewish.
