Since you can create hotkeys for disciplines anyway, and you have 4 
hotbars available with 10 pages each, the macro is only for if you want 
to perform 2 actions with a single keypress or add an emote or battlecry 
anyway, really.

Indeed on the UI I last wrote (New World) I took all the ability slots 
OUT of my combat skills window (leaving it as a small window with 
click-off icon at left, disc timer in centre, and skills menu button at 
right) and now use pages 1 & 2 of hotbar 4 excusively for skills and 
combat AAs, as that allows me to set up my 20 favourite discs / AAs / 
bandolier selections in an easily keymapped / clickable format - e.g., 
as a raid tank,

SHIFT + 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 =

Activate Fortitude
Area Taunt
Mock
Switch to Aggro Weapons
Yell "I'm now TANKING %T, heal me!"

for when the MA dies on a boss mob and I need to pick up the reins
