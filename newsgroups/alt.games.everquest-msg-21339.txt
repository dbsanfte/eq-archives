Well, that's the trouble with mathematics applied to real dimensions.  It
gives the exactly correct answer instead of one adjusted for physical
limitations.  And that's as it should be; the tool should be sharper than
the wood we're carving with it.

Both can be true.  In the case of the Snowflake's area, infinity is
something produced by math, which, ultimately, is our minds' logical
progression written down.  The reality of the snowflake is limited, but our
minds are not.

On the other hand, let us suppose space is infinite.  No matter how big a
figure you can hold in your head for distance, space is infinitely larger
than that.  Infinity in reality would defy any comparison we could attempt
to make.  We think in finite terms, and however large we think those finite
terms are, they are less than nothing in the face of infinity.

Out there in the Great Infinity, one would imagine.  A pleasant journey to
you, Mr. Adams..
