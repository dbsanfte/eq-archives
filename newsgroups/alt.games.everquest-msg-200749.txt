No it makes them worse players. They don't learn how to manage their
mana. No matter how you spin it the mana regen rate of KEI totally
skews how a caster class is played. With my druid I had to switch
between different roots and dots because I didn't have the standing
mana regen rate that KEI offers. It's not a profound skill, but I
would be money, that a KEI-from-birth Druid would evac or run to zone
before even attempting to tough it out.

That deeper reserve and mana regen is a crutch, and teaches bad
habits. But spin away.

Wrong again. Do you even play EQ? The standing mana regen rate of KEI
on a lower level character is insane. Add to that the +250 mana pool,
and you don't even need the twink gear you mentioned.

There isn't a wide selection of "higher-blues" for them to choose
from. They will be hunting in the same level appropriate zones as
players without KEI. With a level cap on spells they are forced to
fight the same level range of mobs that a non-KEI'd player does. The
only difference is that they can fight the upper end of that range
more efficiently. Having KEI doesn't teach them how to handle
themselves, or how to handle resists. You don't learn how to juggle
snare/root, when you regen enough mana to chain cast either spell
every tick. You don't learn how to manage DD spells and keep a reserve
for healing in a group when all of the casters are chain casting with
KEI.

Spin it any way you want, but when SOE finally nerfs KEI, I predict we
will see a sharp decline in caster "skill". Bad habits will be hard to
break, and I am not looking forward to grouping with a caster that
never learned how to manage mana without a KEI-Crutch.
