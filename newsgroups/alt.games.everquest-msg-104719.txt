Why?  You are already useful on experience grinds and one of the two
best soloing classes.  A warrior past 50 can't solo for squat yet no
one says he should be able to.

Druids essentially take the easy path.  1 to 50 you're bathing in
clover and then suddenly you find no one wants you.

The game has been out for 3 years.  Play another class already and get
over it.
