One portal firing... if you pop over to Shadowhaven and get the
very conveniently located Soulbinder to bind you there near the pad.

Luclin destination?  You are there.

DL, Tox, GFay, NK all maximum of zone time plus 15 minutes,
average 7 and a half minutes away.

Further, sensible guild porters can also bind there in shadowhaven,
meaning that they can easily pick up guild melee, who should all
be bound there on the spot.  Only people who need to bind
at the battle site are the clerics, everyone else, who cares where
they are when they are dead?
