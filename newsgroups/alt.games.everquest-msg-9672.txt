Yikes...I sure hope someone doesn't dig down and start posting stuff I
posted 4 years ago...I've said some pretty dumb things in the past. Oh
well...I guess I'll say many more stupid things in the future as well, but
it will remain nothing more than things said on the internet and it will
never become me attempting to interfere with someones life. Biz...I like
you, but you're high strung (like me) and can definately take things too
far. This tends to draw assholes like Avenger (something I'm also guilty
of). I guess it's easier to point it out to you than to take my own
advice...and I guess I need to try a lot harder. I mean look at the shit
that's been put out today...all the real life info on people. Attempts to
get me fired from my job (failed miserably of course...no worries...I'm
still here)...this is going WAY too far. Yes...this post is a reply to you,
but I'm not pointing my finger at you directly..just seemed an appropriate
place to put it. This shit needs to stop. If you people can't take a little
ribbing then get the fuck out...killfile them...or dish it back, but for
GODS sake...don't try to get your revenge by interfering in someones real
life. Karma is a real bitch...and what comes around...goes around. If you're
going to flame someone (advice I definately need to heed myself) keep it on
topic. Make fun of their characters in the game...make fun of the class they
choose...but making assumptions on what they do in their real lives
(jobs...families...lovelife...appearance) is just a waste of time...everyone
around you knows that you've never met these people and know nothing about
them, so it only makes you (me) look foolish.

Someone bitchslaps me on the internet...I have a hard time admitting it, but
eventually I do. Princess has put me in my place a couple of
times...hell...even Avenger has taken some good shots at me here and there,
but come on folks...giving internet psycho's the opportunity to deal REAL
damage somewhere down the road to someones life is WAY over the line. How
would you feel if you found out some stalker went to someones house who you
posted their address on the internet and murdered their entire family? I
know...odds are pretty slim...but why even risk those odds.

Oh well...I've said my peace...I feel a bit better now...you all have
permission to remind me that I said these things if you see me stepping over
the line again. In fact...I want you to remind me.
