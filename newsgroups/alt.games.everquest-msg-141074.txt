You don't have to go and hang with them as a druid. You have invis,
plus if you just head out of the vah shir camp, which is safe, to the
left you go up to the hollowshade moor zone which is lower level and
ALSO near the city of Shar vahl, a newb friendly city. 

So outside of 15 feet of totally safe walking, there is no danger.
