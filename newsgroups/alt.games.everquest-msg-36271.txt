Like this:

/pause #, /cast 1

Where # is a number in tenths of a second.   If the first gem in
your list takes 3.8 seconds, you'd need a pause of at least 38
to wait for it to be done before doing anything else.   In practice,
it needs to be longer due to lag, etc.   For that same 3.8 second
cast, it's most likely you'd need a pause of 45 at least to depend
upon it working correctly.

I posted how to do this a couple weeks back.  You should be able
to find it on www.google.com.
