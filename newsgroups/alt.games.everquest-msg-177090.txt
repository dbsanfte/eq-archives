Shaman, Cleric, Warrior, Warrior.  Shaman handles Buffing and Sowing while
Cleric is responsible for buffing and keeping everyone alive.  You could
swap out one of the warriors for a monk but since the famous "Monk Nerf" of
a few months ago, this option is not as tempting as it was before.  This
group would be a POWER MELEE group.

I have never bee a real fan of a strictly "finger wiggler" group.  The pet
classes are good but a cleric that has two warrior pets will smoke a necro
two man group with pets.  The reason I reccomend a Shaman over a Druid if
from my own experience.  Druids are great and before the POP, you really
needed their ports.  However, for warrior support, the Shaman is a much
better choice.

Before they NERFed the Monk class, I think the strongest two person group in
the game was the Iksar Monk, Iksar Shaman.  Two people playing this team
could be into their 50s in under 2 months.
