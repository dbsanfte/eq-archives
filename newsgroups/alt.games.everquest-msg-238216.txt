Cool.  tried it out with my seriously sub-par system:

Win98, Cel333, 128MB ram, voodoo 4 32Mb

Latest drivers and DX9b installed.

The UI works.  I can see the map.  I can also see PC and NPC names,
the eyes from Skeleton Mobs and some torches.

Everything else is a shade or <random background color>.  Nothing in
the world is being rendered.

Correction, nothing is being shown on screen.  Zoning still takes
about the same amount of time, and the disc activity is similar to
when the Live version is rendering when zoning.  Still get hiccups of
lag when rotating the PC, similar to when the textures are being
loaded.

But nothing is hitting the screen.

Guess it's tine for that upgrade, as I imagine this could be rolled
live shortly.  (We're what, a week or 2 from March's patch day?)

Anyhoo, looks like 3dfx is done, unless some 9.0b drivers surface.
