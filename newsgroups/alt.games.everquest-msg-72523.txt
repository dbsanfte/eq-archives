So i forgot to post in plain text. Ohh big deal frankly. If u cant read a
post ignore it. I happen to post a lot in binary groups (via outlook
express), so I dont feel the need to switch to plain text. However as I'm
far to nice, I try to remember to switch over to plain  text for this group.
I forget once and Tyger has a spasm!! Gee is it that bad. if its so bad u
miss a post, u could copy all the text into a new text document, then save
it as for example 'message.html' and open it with i.e. the HTML tags will be
used in document leaving only the message text. simple :) or get a news
reader for this millennium...

Anyways for those of you who get so upset by a 1 of mispost...here's what u
missed:


Subject:  velious changes

Message: i installed velious. now when i hit 'i' instead of getting the nice
inventory, its like got all my stuff but like in a black table, not the nice
old blue squares lay out. Up side is u can see thru table so nothing sneaks
up, but i hate look of it. If u right click an object text overlaps onto ur
money bar so text is messed up as backgrounds are like smokey colour almost
transparent. can u revert to old, pre velious display?

============================================================================
==

As for how i choose to speak..what is it to u?? I dont think there's any
need for capitals and full words i.e. 'you' not 'u'
As long as u can understand what I am trying to communicate, then the
message is a success if it not? How i choose to speak is my business not
yours. I put capitals in at the start of sentences as it makes it easier to
read i.e. lines dont run together. I wasn't aware my grammar and
comprehension were being examined during my leisure time. And yes I do use
7331 (elite, l33t) speak, though not in EQ, but in Counter-Strike. its how a
lot of use speak. If i spoke in Spanish would u get racist?? I could but i
choose to use not to. i expect u hate it when people say "w00t" etc?? Its
just a custom language, i fail to see why it affects you. Its not insulting
u is it? Its just a style that is associated with some games, age groups
etc. I dont bitch about anyone else's style, so please show some respect and
restraint.

Thanks
