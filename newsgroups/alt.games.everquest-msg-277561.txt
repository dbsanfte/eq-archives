Thank God they didn't do that, I would have left SoE entirely then.  EQ1 
is far and away a better game than EQ2, even if they are steadilly 
ruining it.  The only reason I play EQ2 is I have some friends playing, 
and it's looking pretty grim for many of them now, so there is a good 
chance I'll be dropping it soon, and just staying with EQ1.
