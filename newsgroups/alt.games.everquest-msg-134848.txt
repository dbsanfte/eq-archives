But as soon as his bargain-priced item sells, what
remains are the ones at or near the "normal" price.

One lowballer can't pull down the normal price,
for an item which sells in reasonable volumes.

The lowballer will make a quick sale, and his
customer will be happy at having gotten a bargain,
but after that one transaction things return to
normal.

It already has.  Yesterday evening there were a grand
total of 21 people in EC.  Period.

And people seem to be moving their sales mules to
the Bazaar en masse.  As I was waiting for the DL
spires to fire and lift me to the Nexus, the character
next to me did a /say, "So this is what the world
looks like - I've been standing next to Shady in the EC
tunnel for the past two years..."

ROFL.

Only of those items that were "wrongly" priced
due to the constraints of supply/demand for that item.

The nature of the Bazaar will quickly stabilize
prices to their actual free-market value, since
one of the key features allowing a free market to
reach a price equilibrium is the ability of buyers
to easily "comparison shop" for similar products.
