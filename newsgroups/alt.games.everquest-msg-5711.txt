Thanx.

Sorry to hear that Xegony has a ruined CC ! We were 8 players in zone when i
left CC an hour ago (00.40am GMT - im at 01.40am though) And we fought some
orcs and geonids. Just a few gems dropped, but again - nice exp... now i
miss CoM, though :o)

But Tunare is cool... farmers havent ruined zone yet. But others zones/areas
are gone :(
