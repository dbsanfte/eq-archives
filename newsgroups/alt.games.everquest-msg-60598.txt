> What quest is this milk run?

---- Begin Quote ----
Priests of Marr
The Priests of Marr is the main faction for Paladins and Clerics of Erollisi
Marr. Faction Raising Quests: The best way to raise faction with the Priests
of Marr is to give milk to Mojak Hikspin, who fishes by the lake in West
Commonlands. Giving Mojax milk will spawn a npc named Duggin Scumper, a
thief. Kill Duggin and return the note to Eeyana Naestra in the Hall of
Truth in North Freeport. If you dont want to run back and forth from WC to
NFP, you can just keep giving milk to Mojax. You can also do just about any
Knights of Truth quest to raise Priests of Marr faction, and vice versa.
Also, you can go FP Militia Guard hunting to raise Priests of Marr faction.
---- End Quote ---

Note: That Mojax guy is at the South End by the lake...
As long as you ain't KOS to FP, you can just ignore that
thief, otherwise he might aggro you...
Just keep Mojax from running off by hailing him every 3 or 4 times
you turned in milk....
You get faction for every single bottle of milk you turn in,
but at the max 4 times in one turn-in, so give him stacks of
4, one at a time, and this will do fine.
You _will_ get KOS to Militia in the process though...
So you might want to do the Message to Rebbie-quest
before, that way you get up to indifferent with FP merchants
rather quick (collect 20 rebbies rat whiskers with any char, give them to
the one who needs the faction, and have that char turn
the whiskers in to the DEF rogue, one at a time)

Enjoy a loving new family feeling among the Priests of Marr :)
