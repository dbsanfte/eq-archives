Theres one more alternate rules server - Firiona Vie, the roleplaying
server.

Languages are hard coded there - there is no "common" tongue. You want
to talk to a dwarf? Learn dwarvish. And the rate you can learn
languages is capped, I think, to one point every 2 hours. IT takes
roughly 100 points to be able to converse comprehensibly in a language.

I believe Firiona Vie may have "trivial loot code" enabled everywhere
as well, meaning if you kill something to low level to give you experience
it wont give you loot either. To compensate for this heinous and evil
device it gets rid of the "no-drop" flag the main servers have on some
servers, equally irritating, that means some items cannot be given away,
sold, traded, dropped, etc. You keep it, or you destroy it, on a normal
server. Not so on FV.

I am not sure if there are hard coded grouping restrictions on FV, I dont
think there are. Its not a PVP server, but you can expect to be ostracised
pretty quickly if you dont play "in character". It also supports just one
character for the server, like Sullon Zek.

Sullon and Firiona are probably the two most "hard core" servers, and
opposite ends of the spectrum.
