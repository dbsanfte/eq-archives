Gould a 55 monk/56 druid (no aa) do ok in the LoY zones? I'd really like to
try but two-boxing when the lag is high due to geography (i live in sydney)
and not having anywhere to run if it goes astray make me wary. I was hoping
to get a emerald warrior charm although i expect since the cap, my iksar's
emerald warrior faction is now just amiable (was ally).
