To an extent.  When does that percentage become so low that it isn't worth
it to work anymore?  Is it when welfare pays more than your after-tax
income?  Many of your enterpenuers will work beyond that, just to keep from
having to suck at the government tete.  Still, many won't.  Also, ask what
that business owner is going to cut back on to cover the costs of the taxes?
It's going to be his payroll (that's the biggest argument against
capital-gains taxes... they're a direct cause of unemployment).  It's the
new branch that he won't be able to afford to open in the next town over
that would have employed another hundred-or-so people.

And, that's without even asking the question, "what right does the
government have to take away 70% of my income?"  Think about it, the gov
makes more money off your time and effort than you do.  There's something
obscene about that.
