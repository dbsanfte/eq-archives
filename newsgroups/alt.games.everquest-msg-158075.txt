How is this any different than the new UI (the "new" one) in the
Velious expansion?

How is it any different than having to buy Luclin for the Bazaar/Nexu,
or Kunark to play an Iksar or level past 50?

If you want to have all the features in EQ, you have to buy the
expansions. It has always been this way.
