Of course I didn't forget about hide/sneak.  Anything that can see through
invis can see through hide/sneak as well, which means anything that is much
higher level than me and undead as well.  This rules out a great many
dungeons. If my shaman were to be seen, at least she has a few tricks up her
sleeve to get out of trouble.

What would happen if my rogue were to be attacked by some nasty while
swimming the great wide sea?  How would I retrieve her body off the ocean
floor?  What if my rogue were to fall in a pit or a pool with steep sides?
Any caster can gate out, not a rogue.  What if I were to get lost in the
dungeon (yes despite having a map this happens to me often) again, a caster
can gate out, not so a rogue.  And, last but not least, if either were to
die while exploring I would prefer it be the caster. My shaman can bind much
closer to any exploring location and sow/buff herself for the corpse run, as
well as protect herself with spells.

I kept reading how wonderful and necessary rogues were at corpse retrieval.
I was so pleased that at least I could do something useful, but except for
hauling my own corpse I was never needed.  I can't tell you how many times I
asked "you need me to hide and drag your corpse?"  "No, we got it"  Nobody
ever needed me.  It was me that needed everyone else and I got sick and
tired of begging to be in a group that really wanted a tank, cleric or
chanter instead of a rogue.  I wanted to start a class that was useful and
appreciated.  I started a shaman and I don't regret it.

I love my rogue, but until there are some changes made to the class I think
she'll be gathering dust.  She's just too difficult to play and not as much
fun as other classes because of the severe melee only limitations she has.
