Funny you should ask... While I'm pretty certain that what I wrote is 
factual (about Spain, Italy, Russia and Japan being the countries 
closest to negative population growth, and the US population growth 
being solidly positive), it's based on information I've read over the 
last few years, so I thought of hitting Google to refresh my data... 
What I found is something pretty damn disturbing instead: Lots of far-
right organizations posing as environmental concerns, and established 
environmental organizations beginning to espouse hardcore anti-
immigration agendas.

One of the few sites I would deem trustworthy on this matter is the US 
Census Bureau:

http://www.census.gov/population/www/projections/popproj.html

But if you want to sort the wheat from the chaff yourself, here's the 
search parameters I used at first:
