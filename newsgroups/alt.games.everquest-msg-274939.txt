Most likely answer would be that a necro creating a bunch of "essence
emerald" (for necro rezz) paid for privilege of sacrificing the
character.

A possible but rare situation is he was bound at the entrance to the
docks and a kos npc was there and put him into a death spiral (kos npc
at or near bind point, he dies, appears at bind, die, appear at bind,
die, ad infinitum).
