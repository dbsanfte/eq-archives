I think that's close to where I'd wind up, too, depending on what things 
change along the continuum. If spoon-feeding and dumbing down are the 
primary metrics, I'd agree with a 3 or 4. The problem, of course, is that 
everyone has a different way of distinguishing "dumbing down" from "removing 
the tedium and leaving the fun".
