Maybe because with escape, after getting hit, they are removed from the 
hate list *and* turned invis.  Of course, it has a chance to fail so if 
it doesn't work you're gonna be senging another rogue/monk and a cleric 
to get him... heh.

Then again... escape only works like once every 72 minutes.  So you only 
get one shot, and you'd have to get hit by all the named at once to check 
them all... so...  ?
