Maybe a clarification is needed.  I know the damage caps are lifted at level
20 but my warrior seems to be hitting harder with his two hander at level 35
than he did at 25.  This is with the same weapon too.  Maybe your weapon
skill also plays into the formula for how much damage you can do?

Just an observation.
