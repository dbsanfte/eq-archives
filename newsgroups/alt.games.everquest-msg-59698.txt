> It's also frowned upon by the user agreement......

I really dont care about that.  Verant (read Sony) illegally changed the
User Agreement from the date of my Original Purchace and therefore voided
thier contract with me.  I have already talked to an attoreny about this
because they tried to have my E-bay account suspended for selling characters
that I no longer used.   I promply had my attorney write a letter to Verant
and E-bay letting them know that they were slandering me, and I would sue
the fuck out of them if they didnt stop.  So they did.  As far as the Law is
concerned, the account belongs to me, while the software belongs to Sony.

I agree completely with this statement.  I have seen this before and it
sucks, however those people are usually identified real soon and they get a
reputation, which means they cant find a group.

Actually, its the reverse.  People tend to have "friends" on a PvP server
that they hunt with.  I for one would NEVER take someone with me on a raid
unless I knew them well.. just because someone is a level 60 Char, doesnt
mean they know thier head from thier ass, Baby Huey or not.. i've met some
stupid people on that game, and I dont associate with any of them..

The ideal person buying this account would be someone who already has a high
level (39+) wizard on a BLUE server and wants to do some PvP instead.. shit,
I worked a cleric to 50 (before level 60 was around) on E'ci and sold it
because all the high level dungeons were mobbed by groups of up to 40
people.. and they all had an order, it was pathetic.. so I went to a PvP
server where I could kill people and take their spawn instead.. :)  More fun
overall.. but even that is boring now too...
