That's some shocking math. I can't even imaging throwing a CHeal on
somebody who's not even down 1K HP. It may be a break even on the mana,
but why bother?

If your tank only has 1200 HP at a time when you're high enough level to
get CHeal, you may want to have a chat with them about their gear.
 
As to CHeal being mana efficient on a larger tank?  These days, if
things aren't really going to hell on an overpull, the CHeals Tiru
throws on me look to average around 2400.  I think her best on me to
date was 29 something, nearly 3K, but that was a raid where I was very
buffed and she was trying valiently to keep several finger wagglers
alive at the same time as keeping me upright while I was MA on one of
the bigger giants in Kael. It was...... interesting anticipation,
watching my health bar continue to drop, while mentally counting "...
six mississippi, seven mississippi...". Got off a bunch of crippling
blows, though. Heh.

Last night we had one miss for the first time in ages and I died. Some
idiots trained the gate in the Hole up on top of us where we were
camping the entrance. They swam to the zone and I proved myself an even
larger idiot by deciding that I would stay and fight *the* Elemental
Crusader and polish it off. I'd just finished to warriors, and was at
low health to start with. Tiru tried to fire off a CHeal on me, but
that's when it became clear that it was actually *THREE* mobs on me, not
one. (Two crusaders and a warrior who were almost perfectly in sync
overlaying each other.) Health dropped waaaaaay too fast, though the
CHeal still almost landed. Would have been a good one if it had.
Probably closer to 3400.
