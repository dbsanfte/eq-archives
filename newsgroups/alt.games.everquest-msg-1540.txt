I know, but to me that's akin to those anti-twinkers (or whatever you'd like
to label them) who throw away items given to them by a higher level player
because it's "cheating." Somebody takes out the time and manna to help me,
whether I want it or not, I'll accept it with grace and move on without
complaint. I'd sooner have a relatively minor taint on the run than know I
threw away the kindness of another player. To remove the buff would have
been a slap in the face to the other player - even if he didn't know he was
slapped.
