Generally at that level, and likely well beyond it, you will need to 
carry extra situational resist gear.  You would then wear the appropriate 
resist gear for the occasion.  In my normal everyday armor, my resists 
are not much higher than yours unbuffed.  I carry around one 8 slot bag 
with mostly blue diamond resist gear in it to swap in, along with two or 
three other resist items that are specific to one or two of the resists.  
Stone of Morrid 30FR/CR, Some shield for poison, can't remember the name.
