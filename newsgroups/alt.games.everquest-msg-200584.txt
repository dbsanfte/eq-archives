I posted on The Safehouse a few days ago trying to find the spawn location
(give or take) of the Avatar of Abhorrance in the new Hate. I haven't heard
back about it yet, so I thought I'd ask a bigger part of the EQ community
for some help. If anyone could point me in the general direction, I'd be
much obliged.

Thanks in advance for your help.
