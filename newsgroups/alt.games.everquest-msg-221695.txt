Warriors Offensive Discs are useless in most situations.  Maybe after your
group has become bored as hell and have spent hours getting EXP in a certain
camp then using the disc for crits and crippling blows is kind of cool.  But
their duration is too short and their reuse time is too long.  It can break
up an otherwise boring camp.  I remember I was in PON and a Pally was Main
Tank.  I was doing the Warrior Rogue impression by staying behind the mob
and hitting it.  I activated this Disc and saw every blow land as a Crit or
Crippling blow for a whole 10 seconds.  Big freaking deal!
