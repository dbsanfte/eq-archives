 Still no lag for the past 2 days. However I made the mistake of
picking a high population realm. WoW locked up and I rebooted and was
rudely introduced to the "Queue" feature. And being a trial account
the paying users get priority. Started off in 54 position and within 5
mins was at the 233 position. I guess it doesn't matter what you play
theres a downside just waiting.
