In original EQ, druids were quite adequate healers combined with shamans
in most groups, all the way into lower guk and sol b. Mob dps was
amazingly low compared to today, 2 healers casting minor heal could keep
a warrior in crafted armor up against frogloks and kobolds without
effort. The main reason druids weren't popular in dungeon groups back
then was because so many had soloed their way into the 40's and had no
clue how to play in dungeons.
