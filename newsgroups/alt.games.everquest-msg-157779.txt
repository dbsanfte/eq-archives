Remember the old D&D days when they had weapons in the game that were
"alive"?  They could potentially hurt the user, or wreak havoc in
inexperienced hands.  Might be kind of fun to do that in EQ and a way to
control twinking.  What if the uber wep had a % chance to suddenly go off
and attack groupmates?  That would be fun to see.  .

Anyway, just my way of finding something to discuss other than POP (which I
don't have)
