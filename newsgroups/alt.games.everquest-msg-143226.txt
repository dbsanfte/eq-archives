Sure it is. Makes a difference between sour grapes between different
guild members and real a-hole "win at any cost" guild. If he stays and
they are a-holes, well get used to being around them. But for some,
the lewtz is the end for EQ. F ' the other players in the game, not
like you have to look them in the eye. Just remember, when you lie
with dogs you get the fleas.

Said he read about their reputation on server board.  The answer or
accusation was there. Ever read your servers rant board?

>I'm not sure how you can come to this conclusion.

In game experience with "uber guilds" with bad reps. The bad reps
mostly all follow the same pattern; motivated by drops and attaining
them at any cost because the ubers CAN. Good sportsmanship, forget it;
take what you can. Since there was a lack of info, I went with the
usual suspect. Once again read your servers rant board, you'll see how
it always seems to come down to two or three things over and over and
over.
