they could add some way to screen for calls.  type in a code that was
specialized for your problem.  thus you would have to be pre-approved to get
the code.  effectively you would not have to pay for immediate service
regarding your problems that they acknowledge you would be helped with.  I
believe that 800 numbers need to be connected for like 30 seconds before you
get charged for the particular call.  I am probably wrong though.  ROFL.

Strattis More, Missan Glow, Tranquil Peace, cannot use surname command to
give them these names.
