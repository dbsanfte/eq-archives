Ahh, read a little closer friend. I said the first "food" slot. I keep mine
in a backpack that is in my first inventory slot.

It is a little more effort than most wis boosting items, less trouble than
memming and casting a spell every hour or so though.  I don't notice it much
anymore since I constantly forage, I just eat any food I pick up immediately
and that keeps me full enough to explode! Also, 5 WIS is nothing to sneeze
at. It will usually allow you to replace another WIS item with a mana item.
I replaced a Plat Jasper +6 WIS ring for a +3 STR/ 30mana ring and still
have 201 WIS. Helps crafting too =).

Anyway, I posted a list of stuff that would add 46 WIS for 1600pp earlier,
this makes it 51 for near the same cost. From 121, he's now 172 - not too
bad ...
