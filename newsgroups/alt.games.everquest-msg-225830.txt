    Giving the best tank class in the game a 9 second refresh insta-aggro is
not good. They may want it, but that doesn't mean it's good for the game.

    The funny thing about this is originally they said that the new system
would NOT work off the old stamina bar. Now, it is. In another part of the
chat session, it also sounds very much like +MANA on items will be converted
to +STAMINA for melees. Everything old is new again! If +STAMINA effects are
removed, what will some of the old spells do?

    The level 20 onwards thing is nice, if it applies to openings. What
level does a melee get his first discipline (resistant?) at? I'm just hoping
he's not referring to that.

    Watch it, though. They haven't said how fast a discipline will drain
stamina. For all we know, using /defensive could drain you from full pool to
empty, with it taking about a quarter hour to regain the lost stamina.

    They did say elsewhere you could hotkey things.

    On Test, right now the mitigation is 4% for a level 25 warrior. I
haven't heard if this scales with level or not. I love this as a cleric
because it means my CH gets more bang for the buck! (But don't tell them, or
they'll nerf it.)

    No, you can still do that. But you won't be getting as much out of your
warrior as you could, just like a caster that only uses a small number of
spells.

    Yup. More importantly, they can make those new abilities be tied to
drops (Tomes), and thus be tied to progression. No need to worry that giving
all X thousand warriors in the game a given ability will mess things up.

    You also make knights into second class citizens for XP groups. Their
utility doesn't really shine there, as the roles they can fill are either
useless or better done by other classes. What made them worthwhile was the
ability to lock aggro so others could do their jobs without being pounded.
With the new breed of high DPS mobs, that became the number one concern with
all other things secondary.

    Yes. But the problem doesn't always lie with the warrior, nor should the
automatic response be to buff up the warrior until there is no problem no
matter what the ranger does.

    No, this will not scale with weapon delay. It'll be like weapon procs,
where the chance to proc is proportional to the delay of the weapon so your
procs per unit time is independent of delay. I imagine what the system does
not take into account, and what JT is trying to get at above, will be things
like triple attack and Flurry.

    This will be useful as a parsing and research tool, but little else. You
Taunt, you get a success, the mob doesn't turn. What will change from
before, when you weren't sure if it worked or not, and now, when you know
you got a success but the mob didn't turn anyways? (This does happen, BTW,
especially if the person who is aggro has one of the special classes of
transient hate like sitting or relative position.)
