AA is completely unrelated to normal leveling.

The only limitation is that you have to be 51 for General AA, 55 for
Archetype, 59 for Class, and 61 (or higher) for the PoP AAs.

Some PoP AAs are limited in that you can only train it once per level 61-65
or once at 61, 63 and 65, or similar.

However you can make as many AA points as you want in a normal level.  I
think any over 24 banked points are lost, but I'm not sure if that was just
done at PoP release or not.
