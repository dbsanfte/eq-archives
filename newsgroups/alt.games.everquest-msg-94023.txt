Using a Toshiba Portege 3440CT (includes an S3 Savage video controller with
8MB of video RAM) and Windows ME, Everquest ran acceptably well.  I recently
upgraded the laptop to WinXP and Everquest is now unplayably slow.  I have
two other desktops running XP and Everquest and they run awesome, so it
can't be purely XP.

It's likely an issue with the WinXP video driver for that chipset, but
haven't been able to find a version that fixes the problem.  Windows Update
has released an update since Windows XP shipped (S3 Graphics Savage/IX
86c298 1179), but this didn't fix it.

Has anyone else run into this problem and fixed it?

- Mike
