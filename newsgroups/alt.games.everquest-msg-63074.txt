It's a decent analogy.  If we cause places like EQ Atlas to exceed their
bandwidth, then they'll shut down because the cost was too high.  For each
one that shuts down, the others must carry their load, which pushes the next
one closer to the edge.  So, if we abuse these sites (note, "abuse," not
"use"), then there will be no more left.
