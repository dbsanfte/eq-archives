Subject: E Q Atlas / Muse not updating site anymore...???

I just read Muse's notice on his site that he would be unable to update EQ
Atlas anymore.  I really love EQ Atlas.  Couldn't he "let" someone else help
him out with this?  It couldn't be me, I'm really computer illiterate.  But
surely there's some way to keep his maps coming...???
I know there are other map sites.  And I'm not saying they suck or anything,
they just aren't as nice as EQ Atlas with the links to Allakhazam...
