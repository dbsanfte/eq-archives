Willy, Freeman, and John already answered you, but I'll say its the
top melee twink item in norrath, had been going for 50kpp after the
spawn nerf a few weeks ago. Permanent effect Fungal Regrowth is so
good, with other good gear as any melee you can fight non stop, *zero*
downtime, all the way to 40, and after that downtime is still minimal
at worst.
