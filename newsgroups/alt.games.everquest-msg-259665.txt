Isn't is something like /doability ?

Ex. is Bash is set on the slot nï¿½ 3 of your attack shortcuts (in the 
little gray box, not on shortcut bar)

It's be something like :


/doability 3
/pause 7
/doability 3
/pause 7
/doability 3

Gotta try, at least :)

If it doesn't work, then it is a tweak made so you can't do this kind of 
macros :)
