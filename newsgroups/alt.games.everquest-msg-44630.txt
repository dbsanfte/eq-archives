The Warrens is an incredibly difficult place.  My level 14 friend and my level
17 can't play there together with any luck.  My 17 is too high - tons of greens
that don't agro on me at all - but agro on him like crazy.  And they are close
together.  We'll clear a spot to hunt the blue-to-me's and about the time we
get started the greens all start spawing again and we're back to square one. 
Plus they won't drop teeth because *I* am too high a level.  
The lower level players - where the kobolds ARE blue to them - get quickly
overpowered because the aggro is so bad.  
To correct the problem:  get rid of the loot thing and set the spawn points
further apart.  Can they do that once an area is open?

  >Warrens- Hardly ever see anyone in here, and I pass thru a lot.
