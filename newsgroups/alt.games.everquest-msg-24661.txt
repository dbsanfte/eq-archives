One thing to keep in mind.. Charisma items are cheap, and easy to get.
A crude stien and a pair of +7 charisma bracers alone will net you
something over 20 charisma.

Also, keep in mind that nobody has really been able to find too much
evidence on exactly how much charisma helps charm/mes.  Meanwhile, you
*know* what intelligence and mana do fo you.

Offhand, considering how easy it is for enchanters to get night
vision, it seems like Erudite would make a good choice.  With that
much starting intel, you won't need nearly as much intel gear later
on, and you can concentrate on resistance suits.

Personally, I've allways been fond of Dark Elf enchanters.  The
starting location is excellent, faction isn't too much of a pain as
long as you pick agnostic, and you start off with ultravision.
Erudite would be a close second, provided you can get yourself off of
Odus, posthaste.
