I am curious as to why you don't just keep your gear to swap in a bag?
I used to swap a lot of right-click gear in and out with Kaev, and I
found that with two hot-keyed slots I could handle all of it easily.
One slot was for the items that could be clicked from inventory, and
the other had a bag (that I always kept open) with spare weapons,
shield, and all of my clicky gear (Rallic Pack is a wonderful bag
bag for this).  The reason to hot-key the bag slot, even tho I had it
open all the time, is because it closes sometimes (zone or hit escape
to clear target window) and I didn't always realize it was closed
until after I was already trying to cope with multiple adds, so it's
nice to be able to open the bag with a single keystroke.  Eventually
I decided it was a lot easier on the wrists to just pay for KEI and
quit swapping all that gear around.  Of course, lately I've been
mostly playing Druid and Shaman characters, which have more power
with no KEI and crap gear than my Paladin could even dream of without
great gear and massive buffs.

Kaev <--- who thinks EQ Bards are way too much work to be "play"
