And, like me, you've probably been alone a lot. The newbie zones, at
least on the server I was on, were empty. So were the non-newbie
zones. At level 43, I felt like I was the only untwinked non-alt on
the server; everyone else near my level was someone's 95th mule racing
to make L60 so that they could be with the rest of their guild. Why
did I bother working for decent, level-proper gear, when I could just
buy stuff on the bazaar 15 levels above whatI could hope to earn
myself?

I much prefer the "fresh start" of EQ2, where I can be in the bottom
quarter, instead of the bottom hundredth.

Three of the last 4 expansions were aimed entirely at high-end play.
What does that tell you about the direction of the game?

You can enjoy the low-end game, sure, but don't expect to see anything
new added. At this point, in EQ1, level 50 isn't the cap -- it's the
beginning.
