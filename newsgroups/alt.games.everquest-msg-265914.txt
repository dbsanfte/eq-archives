I've got a theory, that it's a Demon, a dancing Demon,
No something isn't right there
I've got a theory, some kid is dreaming
And we're all stuck inside his wacky Broadway nightmare
I got a theory, we should work this out
It's getting eerie, what's this cheery singing all about?
It could be Witches, some Evil Witches
Which is ridiculous, cause Witches they were persecuted
Wicked good and loved the earth and Woman power
And I'll be over here.
I've got a theory, it could be bunnies...................
