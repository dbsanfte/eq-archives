Hi,

Wonder if people can let me know what experience is like for levelling up
after level 60,

Dusted off my Pally and took him from 59 to 61 last week. Mostly on Sun
Revenants either solo or two boxing with my Druid healing and DOT'ing.
Experience seemed fairly fast. However since hitting 61 it has really slowed
to almost nothing on the same mobs. Took me about 5/6 Sun Rev;'s per blue
bubble at 60 - now looks as though it is going to be around 15!


Any thoughts?
