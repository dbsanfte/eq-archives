     In a.g.e chat, no less.  Which is sorta odd to me, since I am notorious for
tuning that chat out for hours at a time, then responding to the last thing that
was said (I wish there was a command to add a timestamp to any particular chat
channel if one wanted to).  So Zin, you do know that if you say in age "Just
died twice and undinged :(" and I don't respond with "Where's the bodies" you
should send me a tell, right?

    I really don't mind.  I'm pretty sure I do more rezzes for age folk than for
my own guild.
