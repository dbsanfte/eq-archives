*sigh* even that doesn't work sometimes.

I watched a guy fighting stuff naked for awhile.  I was working on 
tailoring skill so I gave him a load of beginners armor (forget what it's 
called, but y'know - large tattered mask, that sorta thing) - not much, 
but it does help - and gave him a complete set of buffs - then awhile 
later I zone into the nearest town just in time to hear him yelling out 
"anybody got some money for a newbie player?"

I didn't give him anything more next time I saw him.

What with new SoW ability, I've been handing them out fairly regularly, 
especially to newbies fighting hard, but what gets me is when somebody 
says "SoW?" as I run by and I say "oom, but for a plat I'll stop, med, 
and give you a SoW and all the other buffs I got on me as well" only to 
get a rude (or no) response back.  Oh I'm sorry, was I supposed to stop 
what I was doing to cater to you?  I've already had about a dozen people 
lecture me on "people will be kind to you if you're kind to them" (then 
why aren't you giving me the plat I need for the SoW you need?)
