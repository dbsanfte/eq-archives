Everything you say is true, and if you look at what I spend on *EQ*
related expenses, it's rediculous. (I won't even go into that list.) But
seriously, for Usenet? I only have that account because my provider's
newsfeed sucks. So yeah, six bucks isn't that much, and that's all I
spend on Usenet. There definitely *should* be a limit for anyone for any
given past time. But I do get a certain amount of entertainment value,
information, etc. out of Usenet groups. (I subscribe to others with
friends, etc. obviously) so I still think it's not a huge price for the
service. And it's reliable and seems to pick up all the groups I want
and most of the posts the majority of the time.
