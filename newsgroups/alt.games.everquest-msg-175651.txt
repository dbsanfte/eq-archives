How about once you become a jedi and go down the dark path and become
a dark jedi? Is it possible to flop back and forth? (ala Anakin).
Gaaawd - i hope not. Brings back chilling memories of UO's blue PKers,
who knew how many PK's they could do until they turned red and
manipulate thier murder count so theyd always be blue.

If they dont allow this (which i hope) I can just hear the whining ...
"but Darth Vader switched back to the good side!!!". Yeah - just as he
died.
