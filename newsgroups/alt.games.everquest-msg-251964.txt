Buying plat is cheating. (tm)

There is no simpler way to put it. You can shade it, shill for
scumbags like Yantis, make some fine line between it being a EULA
violation yet accepted by players. In the end, it is cheating.

If I found guildmates buying plat I would guildremove them. For one,
it is too easy to get plat. I know a way a 1st level character can get
plat and exp by killing spiderlings. You can exceed a few hundred plat
an hour, if you also vendor dive for 'ling silks.

How much plat do you need at 1st level? Overpowering items at these
levels are not going to help you learn your character's strengths and
weaknesses. You are not going to be in cloth long, if you do the
newbie quests, most items for those, even the rares, took me a rl day
or two to get.
