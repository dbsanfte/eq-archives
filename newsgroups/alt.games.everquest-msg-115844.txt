Ok, I'm using an extreme example, but this "I'm offering to pay, so I'm
not doing anything intrusive" argument isn't spotless.  Would it be OK for
a guy to go up to a hot chyck, and say "It would help me greatly if I
could get laid right now. I'm offering to pay...let me know if you'd be
interested."

Because he's willing to pay, the woman shouldn't be bothered....right?  
He was polite, after all. I mean, there are plenty of women out there who
will have sex for money, she might be one of them for all he knows.  It's
much easier to just ask her directly.
