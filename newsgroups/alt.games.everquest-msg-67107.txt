I wouldnt imagine the tree movements would make much of a difference. The
tree has to be redrawn anyway, and it wont matter if its position has
changed slightly. What *is* the problem is the sheer number of
trees/vegetation. In particular, WW, parts of BW and TT. I find the slowest
fps zones to be city zones now. Paineel is awful now. yet zones like skyfire
run at maybe 3x the frame rate.
