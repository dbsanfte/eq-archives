If they have a healer partner then they aren't likely to care about 
regen either.  This is a relativity situation, where you can say "first 
aid is better than regen for a warrior" in the same way as you might say 
"a Twinkie is more nutritious than a Ding Dong" without meaning to imply 
that either is particularly good for you.

Monks, however, even in groups, may end up in situations where they are 
out of range of healing, hurt bad, but have no aggro.  Are they better 
with regen (so they can stay FD and get back up to a point where they 
can move again?) or with First Aid (so they can find a aggro free spot 
and heal up to full more rapidly?)  I personally don't know which is 
better for them, but 3 points of regen per tic isn't a whole lot when 
you are down by 2000, so I assume the latter.

Yup, there have been some game altering additions.  How about 
Necromancers?   Seems like you could feed them hp beneficially, and even 
if they don't need the mana they could feed it to someone who does.

As a mage I'd be tempted to get it if it wasn't for the fact that A) My 
skill seems to be capped at 100 and B) turns out you can't bind wounds 
from drogmarback like I thought, so it costs me med time.
