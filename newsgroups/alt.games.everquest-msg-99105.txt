Yeah that sounds like my problem - I think if I look at large objects or
intensive screens like forests and water it happens.
So what did you do to fix it? I don't get packet loss, I get disconnected
outright. Most times I think the game waits until a mob is aggroed on me tho
;P
I can sometimes avoid it by staring at the ground as I run. BTW, both
replies have been 100% more helpful than any GM so far, keep em coming :)
