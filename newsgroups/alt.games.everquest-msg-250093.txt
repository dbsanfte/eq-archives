Well hang on, I am confused. Are we talking about what SOE SAID
or what they WROTE? Because we know they SAID a lot more than
they wrote, including a load of stuff that wasn't just for high-end
raiding guilds. They also SAID that they were impressed at the book,
the CDs, the stacks of lists of issues, that they were given and they
would be working through them in due course. It seems to me that
if we were reacting to what SOE SAID, we'd have a lot more cause
to be positive.

What they WROTE, was a piece of paper that directly related to
stuff that they thought could be fixed quickly, and was aimed at the
target audience of people sat round that table. It's not even an official
press release, it's just something that the guilds who were there could
take away with them. It comes with disclaimers a mile wide that people
are choosing to ignore, and I can't help think, why?

See this is what I'm saying, that no-one seems to get, just because
you've stumbled across a bit of information that has nothing written on
it about your concerns doesn't mean that they're not going to be addressed.
I'm not trying to "spin" it at all, I'm just not jumping at the first chance
to
be negative about something. At this time the whole community has the
ear of the developers. You can spend that time complaining about how
hard done by you are or you can make suggestions of your own. ONE
of these courses of action results in improvement, one does not.

You know, it's up to you totally what you do, and if the game is sullied
for you beyond the point you feel you want to fight for it then by all means
go off and play WoW. Enjoy it! The rest of us will send our emails and
our messages and get our voices heard, thanks.
