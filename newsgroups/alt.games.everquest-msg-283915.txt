Don't know.  May want to google.  You may want a list of riddle
answers.

No.  The way it works is as soon as 3 people get up in the 'room', the
hatchlings (or whatever they are) spawn all at once.  One person won't
trigger the trap, which is one of the reasons it caught so many people.
 It takes three.  However the mobs don't see invis and we have always
managed to do this without agroing.  Still, for best results, invis up
and send the three classes you can stand to lose.  (Just keep in mind
that time is of the essense in a Tipt.)

As stated you don't have to get agro on anyone.  However just as a side
note you will need to pull them and they cannot be pac'd as I recall.
It shouldn't matter though, most will come as singles and maybe a few
doubles.  Plus they don't hit as hard as the other mobs in the zone so
you should be able to handle an add.

An enchanter might be nice since you can end up with quite a few adds
at times (really only if you screw up...but then screwing up isn't that
hard to do in a Tipt).  The Bard may not be able to handle that kind of
crowd control?  Not sure though.  Also can any of them offtank or
handle rampage?  I'm pretty sure the Kyv at the end will rampage.
