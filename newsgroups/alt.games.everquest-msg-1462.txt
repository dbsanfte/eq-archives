Played a crowd controling bard for over a year. I know that it's not the 
same thing, but it gives me the approximate idea. I have extensively 
watched good enchanters do their thing, so I have some idea from there.
In addition I do intend to group some, just not much
And lastly, as long as I don't get anyone else killed, I don't mind 
dying without getting rezzed :) My monk has gotted one rez in his entire 
career (except raids, of course), and I don't think it's hurt him too 
much

Some of my powerlevelling program includes levels 20-25 or 30 in 
Mistmoore. I know it's painful, but it's empty, it looks pretty, and 
I've never been there enough. That should give me some practice material
