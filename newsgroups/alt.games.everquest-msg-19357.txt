Probably because of one or two things (1) [unlikely] its a pet class and it 
may be easier to include all pet classes than exclude one programmatically 
(either one class or all classes, no in-between) so it will be a useless 
spell; and/or (2) [more likely] some pathing areas may cause the pet to 
either wander off or zap to a safe point and come wandering to find the 
hapless enchanter (happens in Najena to my mage if I'm not careful).  Of 
course, it may now be part of the "Vision" and that's why.  ;)
