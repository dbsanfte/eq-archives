Farming, farming, farming. Top that with a quite easy quest each
enchanter and his dog makes at least a dozen times, and you end up
with a zillion Steins on the market, and not that much new casters to
buy them.
Supply vs demand (scarcity) is maybe what you want to look into ;)

I've done the quest 4 times in all, selling three Steins and keeping
one for me. I think that's enough. Sold each for 200pp, and used that
600pp amount to insure I won't have to worry about my spells until a
fairly decent level.
Of course, some greedy people want to it hundreds times. But then,
they are the ones who screw the market by pouring huge amounts of
Stein into it *AND* oddly complain because it is screwed...
