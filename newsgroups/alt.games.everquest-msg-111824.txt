   Sounds like a good way to get them to follow you around
for the next hour or so cussing you out, which might be
amusing.  Or, a way to get them to /petition, which might
not be so amusing.

   Heh.  Gives a whole new meaning to "quality time",
doesn't it?  But if they're that much of a loser, I would
think that there's a good chance they might just start
sending you nasty /tells.  But then, /ignore would work
great in that situation.
