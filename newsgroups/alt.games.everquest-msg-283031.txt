*** Headlines ***

- Thank you for participating in the 7th Anniversary events. We hope you
  enjoyed them!

- Applications for the Itemization Designer position are now closed. Thank
  you to all who submitted an application!

- A new Monster Mission has been added to the Prophecy of Ro expansion.

- The reuse time on all the veteran rewards has been reduced by 4 hours.

- The stacking issues related to Gift of Mana and Abundant Healing have
  been resolved.

- We are refunding the Spell Casting Deftness AA to Enchanters.

- You will no longer take damage when you have an aura on you and are
  moving fast while mounted.

*** Quests & Tasks ***

- Added an item reward at the end of the Corruption story arc in Elddar.
  Turn in the Chalice of Life to Shalowen the Pure when you have finished
  the arc.

- Changed the second kill element in Bill Whistletop's trade skill armor
  pattern book quest to include all Stillmoon stone drakes (instead of just
  the Stillmoon stone casters).

- Fixed a bug with the Become the Vessel quest that would fail to give
  credit for kills when a pet got the kill shot.

- Further adjustments to some of the tradeskill trophy tasks, especially
  Fletching, were made.  In some cases this was to clarify and fix a bug,
  in others it was to ease some of the rare items needed by changing the
  element to another item.

*** NPCs ***

- Widdlethorpe in Stoneroot Falls will now give you Magical Corathus Coral
  if you wish to continue your practice even if you have already completed
  the Learning the Power mission.  Just tell him you would like to
  practice.

- It seems that the shipments of wolf blood were missing.  You will now
  find Measure of Wolf Blood on the appropriate merchants.

- Shards of Ro will no longer drop.  Instead Powder of Ro will drop at a
  much greater rate than Shards did.

- The gnomework bankers in Corathus Creep will no longer get involved in
  any fighting; they just want peace and a bouquet of bolts and gears.

*** Events & Missions ***

- Brazlin the High Priest of Ro has summoned his enforcer to help bring the
  difficulty of the Corruption of Ro raid more in line with the reward.

- Upped the drop rate of Deathknell key pieces dropping from the Porthio
  event.

- A new Monster Mission has been added to the Prophecy of Ro expansion.
  Speak with Oathmir in Devastation for more information.

- The key to Tunare's Shrine from the Corruption of Ro mission arch will
  now be placed on your key ring the next time you use it.

- The Guardian of the High Priest in the Corruption of Ro mission will now
  have a chance to drop a Last Blood augment to bring the reward more in
  line with the difficulty of the event.

*** Tradeskills ***

- Added a Brewing Barrel to the Bazaar.

- Rejoice, the master tradesmen of New Tannan have found a way to
  concentrate Celestial Solvent. This concentrated solution will work with
  three of the same magically imbued items as before in order to make three
  doses of celestial essence at a time.

- Rock salt can now be ground to fine salt in batches of five or ten.

- Fixed the tradeskill flag on Favor of Druzzil.

- Raised the trivial on Druzzil's Steel Bowstring.

- Adjusted the trivial on the highest end bows from Prophecies of Ro.

- Reduced the yield of Composite Treant Laminating Adhesive to 2.

- The poison Freezing Feedback has had the effect changed to Freezing
  Feedback (instead of Anemone Feedback).

- Changed the research recipe for Blood of Saryrn to use Saryrn's ink
  additive instead of Bertoxxulous'.

- Changed the research recipe for Legacy of Bracken to remove the use Ink
  of the Tribunal.

*** Zones ***

- Changed the teleporters within the bazaar. When going to a "Hall" from
  the base location, you are no longer facing the teleporter. When
  teleporting down from the hall, the location has been changed so that you
  are on the other side of the teleporter with it to your back. This should
  prevent lag from making you go in a loop.

- There is now an augmentation sealer at the Wayfarer camp in Lavastorm.

- The fungus farm in Kaladim has been re-cultivated.

*** Player Characters ***

- The AC cap and the returns over the cap for rangers and berserkers has
  been slightly increased.

*** AAs ***

- Refunded Spell Casting Deftness AA to Enchanters. SCD was being
  overwritten by Quick Buff (a similar AA with superior benefits).

- Reduced the reuse time on all the veteran rewards by 4 hours.

- The stacking issues related to Gift of Mana and Abundant Healing have
  been resolved. Abundant Healing is once again available to purchase for
  healing classes and should now work properly if you also have Gift of
  Mana. You cannot proc both of them with one spell, but should see both of
  them procing now.
 
*** Items ***

- Fazzle's Map of East Wastes will no longer disappear from your inventory
  if you log out.

- Altered many of the PoR Jewelry.  This change was to fix No Drop Items
  that should have been Attunable, and to fix some statistics
  inconsistencies. Also, the HP/MANA gained were balanced with some
  recommended and required levels if the gain is 50 or greater. In some
  cases this resulted in greater restrictions, in others it actually
  reduced the restrictions.

- Modified the Tribute and Guild Tribute values of several items that were
  either Attunable or NoDrop.

- Changed the Tradeskill flag on a few more items.

- The Fabled Baton of Flame now is now 27 damage, and +1 damage to fire, 18
  delay.

- The Fabled Flute of the Sacred Glade now has a 3.2 modifier to wind
  instruments.

- The Fabled Shawl of Perception now has spell shielding and dot shielding
  instead of combat effects and accuracy.

- Certain Fabled items have their AC increased.

- Changed the Tanned Hides that were brought to my attention that had an
  abnormally high merchant greed setting to a more reasonable merchant
  greed setting.

- Reduced the drop rate of the Sister's Opulent Backstabber.

- Increased the drop rate of the Spiroc Wingblade in Plane of Sky.

- Modified the drop rate of plate, chain, leather, and silk on Rikkukin and
  Kessdona to better reflect the number of classes that can use the items.

- Caerlyna will now trade an Ethereal Satchel of Gathering for an Ethereal
  Satchel of Gathering Token and vise versa.

- Fixed many bag tokens that were stating the incorrect size for their
  appropriate bag.

*** Spells ***

- Several Prophecy of Ro NPC spells have been modified to be somewhat less
  annoying, like Resonating Screech, Howling, Grappling Roots, Thorny
  Vines, Sage's Curse, and Shimmering Silence Dust.

- Fixed an exploit with the buff blocking feature.

*** Line of Sight ***

- Line of Sight issues that were introduced with the last update should now
  be resolved.

*** Guilds ***

- Newly formed guilds will now be able to get into their guild halls.
