Velious is great.  I love that expansion.  Interesting and fun mobs, wide
open spaces, and its nice and cold (reminds my barbarian of home)  I
havent gotten into the thick of it yet as I have not gotten the higher
levels yet, but soon I hope.  Must fun thing to watch is the Ring War
though, watching the mayhem and carnage.
