Notable additions/changes:

> - The cities love their artisans! Citizenship granted to crafters at level 
> 6!

Artisans automatically become citizens now and do not have to engage in 
combat to leave the Isle or enter the cities. With this patch the separation 
and independence of artisans and adventurers becomes greater.

> Dynamic Adventure Camps

No idea what this refers to. Others in beta know what this means?

> - The spawn times for all solo wanderers have been increased.

Ouch, like we needed more wanderers complicating encounters?

> - Young timber wolves have been added.

Thank God! Hope they also added automatic responses to all /ooc "Where can I 
find young timber wolves"?

> *** Mechanics ***

> Tradeskills

> - Added three more tradeskill instances to each Qeynos Village and 
> Freeport District.

Lol, "more" = "some". I was wondering why the main cities had no 
tradeskilling instances, thought they didn't want any stinking artisans 
living there. So now we're full citizens and they've given us new places to 
play. Amen. ;-)

> - Traveling boats have been removed from Antonica, Commonlands, Nektulos 
> Forest, and Thundering Steppes.

Wow. If this means that dock bells are now limited to traveling around the 
little villages surrounding the cities and there is no more easy 
intercontinental travel, the world just got a lot bigger.
