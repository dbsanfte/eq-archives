I should say for the record I base my opinion on first hand
experience alone: I play several male and female characters
and there is no question I get more attention (both the good
kind and the bad kind) when playing female characters.

I must sheepishly admit I don't turn down free plat and items
when I play my female characters - which is almost always
offered to me during levels 1 through 20.  My male characters
are generally not on the receiving end of such generosity.

Of course I also play on the assumption that every female
character is in fact male.  Being happily married also helps
because the result is my lack of interest in flirting with
female characters.
