I'm going to assume you aren't trolling and are a genuinely frustrated
player.  That being said, here are a few thoughts:

1) This game does take some time to get the hang of.  But once you do,
you'll probably get hooked like so many us.

2) An Iksar Warrior is going to have a tough life, especially if you like
travelling.  Iksars are almost universally hated outside their city so
you're likely to be killed on sight (KOS) just about anywhere else you want
to go.  Also, in my opinion, most of the pure fighting classes are very bad
for soloing.  You take lots of damage and can't do much to heal yourself.
That means LOTS of downtime.  If you're not going to group I would suggest
trying a different character.  A pet class, like a necro, would be good
because your pet takes most of the damage anyway.  Some of the healing
classes can be decent soloers because they can heal themselves, but they
have their own difficulties because they'll generally have to resort to a
higher level of fighting tactics than just bashing to enemy.  Druids tend to
be very popular for soloing.  A last thought about exploring is that this
game is generally not designed for exploring at low levels when just about
anything in the world can kill you (and if you're an Iksar most everything
will probably try :).  The more levels you gain, the more places you can go
without lower levels creatures bothering you.  Many classes, not warriors,
will at some point (usually not at very low levels) get invisibility or
camoflage which lets explore MANY more places in safety.

3) Until you know the creatures you are fighting, ALWAYS  /consider  each
creature before you attack it.  As you advance in levels, even fights are
not always that even for non-pet classes.  Pet classes have an advantage
because it's almost like a 2 on 1 situation.  Some creatures just match up
betters against different classes.  It also varies from creature to creature
how tough they REALLY are and how they  /consider  is just an approximation.
Some will be surprisingly easy when you expect a tough fight and others that
look easy (in my case, I have problems with most spell casters even if they
/con blue) will kick your ass.  If they  /consider  green or as an easy
fight, don't bother fighting them because you won't get experience.  Only
fight them if you want whatever loot they drop.  Can you say plague rat
tails? :)

4) If you can't keep or get your real life friends to play with you, try
grouping with those you don't know at least until you get the hang of
things.  Most groups will want or need at least 1 fighting class and usually
2 or 3.  A good group should have at least one healing class available to
save your ass when you start to get clobbered.  Groups can set their sights
quite a bit higher and take on gambles and even a lot of tombstones that are
near their levels.  Once you learn what you're doing, assuming you start to
enjoy the game like the rest of us, tell your friends to try again and show
them what you've learned.  Once you advance a little bit, start exploring.
A bard can, I think at level 19, sing a group invisibility song and your
whole group get to all kinds of cool places.  If you switch to a class that
can invis yourself, feel free to go trekking on your own.  But a lone
warrior, without invisibility, is just asking to get killed somewhere along
the way.  You'll always run into something mean that's tougher than you are
if you travel far enough.

5) Many quests are worthwhile, a lot are not.  Most of my money I get by
killing creatures and selling their loot.  Be sure to buy a backpack or two
early on so you can collect more without returning to the vendors so often.
If you have the Shadows of Luclin expansion, hit the bazaar to buy lots of
low-level gear cheaply.  If not, asking if anybody is selling or tailoring
patchwork, etc.  Lots of newbie areas have large rats and plague rats.
These are level one creatures that drop the aforementioned 'plague rat
tails'.  These can generally be sold for over a plat each, although evil
classes (esp. Iksar :) might not find vendors willing to trade with them if
they're outside their own lands.  This is a great way to make newbie money
early on.

Finally, you've obviously found out that the manual can't tell you
everything.  Ask questions in the newbie zones by doing an  /ooc  (out of
character) command and somebody can usually help you out.  MMORPG's rely
heavily on others players to keep the game exciting, soloing is fine but not
what this game is really about.

Hopefully, since you are writing here, you haven't given up on EQ just yet.
Learn the basics and you'll find out exactly why this game is by far the
most popular MMORPG.  Good luck!
