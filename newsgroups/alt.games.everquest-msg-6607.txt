I *guess* this is ok. I've never personally gone backwards more than two levels,
nor do I know anyone who has. I have to wonder how many people would (on the non
pvp servers) purposely lose more than two levels?

Thanks! A nitpic, yes, but annoying.

Was this really a problem? Good to know, anyway.

Good change!

HURRAAY!  Possibly the best change here. I do tend to travel with different
circles of people with different characters, and 20 really wasn't enough.  Now
the big question........ did/will the /ignore list be changed likewise?

> - You can now move items around inside containers that are in the bank.

All this time I was unaware that this was a bug.  But it was DAMN annoying. My
helmet is off to Verant for fixing this.

I wonder who this is going to screw ove.... ummm..... affect?  I suddenly
picture my monk needing to be an "ally" to do the Treant fist quest.
