Good dictionaries use actual research to back up the sequence chosen.

I beleive pussy foot is more a perjorative metaphor for their agility or 
nimbleness and ability to stay on their feet, not cowardice.

But it really doesn't matter what the etymology is.

Nope. Its totally applicable regardless. In fact the reason I brought it 
up is precisely because the etymology of faggot for bundle of sticks and 
twigs has no derivative connection at all to the slang meaning.

And of course the relevancy is that you could still get banned for 
saying it.
