Cleric is always 95+m after every fight, if it took 1 more cheal for me than
a warrior, thats an extra 5-7000 healing.

The mana difference for 1 extra cheal every now and then just doesn't even
rate - its a miniscule amount.  But the extra 5+k heal is a massive
difference in a PoP zone mob (typically very short encounters).

I know it doesn't make all that much difference, but I have various regen
items too that others may not (10th dain ring, various AoB slots etc)

Well I can link random_caster_loot and I get accused of dick waving (stuff i
cant even use, least of all own!), so I tried to leave numbers out of it,
but for clarification 7330(ish) hp,  1530(ish) AC.

What kind of AA's do you have?  I don't think AA's put me into my current
position, they just make it easier as I go higher (I had no defensive AA's
when I was "soloing" and tanking in PoV) the mobs in HoH are pretty similar
in dps, just now I have lightening reflexes 5, CA3 and CS3 to further aid
