First spend 10 to 20 experience points in baking. Sometimes i start with only 5.

Buy a spit in the store next to the soulbinder in east freeport.

Go either upstairs in the casters guild and buy batwings or go to the last
Inn in East Commons (the erudite lady) and buy batwings.

A lot of food vendors sell frosting.

First recipe: batwing and frosting. just combine them in the spit and keep
it until it says "you can no longer advance your skill"


Then go to East freeport docks (or any other vendor that sells fish) and then
go to the first Inn in East commons and buy jug of sauces.

Second recipe: fish filets. Combine in spit and keep doing it until "you can
no longer advance your skill".

Third recipe: Fishrolls. Combine batwings and fresh fish in spit until "you can
no longer advance". This is somewhere in the 120's or 130's.

These three recipes are the omptimum for mastering baking quickly.

Now, go to ping fuzzlecutter (the gnome in the lean to outside the west freeport
gate) and buy a few stacks of fuzzlecutter formula 5000.

If fuzzlecutter wont sell to you then you need to do the rebbys rat whisker
quest in east freeport to get faction up.

Every one of my characters is a master baker and i dont have to rely on anyone
for food and water when im a long way from home. You can even make stacks and
stacks of fishrolls and buy a buttload of fuzzlecutter and take them to out of
the way zones and sell them. I sell fishrolls for 10pp a stack and fuzzlecutter
for 20pp a stack and i dont have a problem with overstocking. Mind you this is
in zones with higher level characters.
