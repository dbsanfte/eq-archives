The data for this was gotten at

http://www.knightsofloyalty.com/expcalc.php

Which has always proved accurate in the past,
and he seems to have the new bonuses and ZEM's
for PoP in there.

The math that follows simply shows that if
a 51 and a 56 both kill a level 55 mob, they
both get a bonus, but he 51 gets a bigger
bonus.

The lowest level mobs that give the bonus are level
Max(55, PL - 5)
The base bonuse at PL-5 is 1.95 and it increases .13
for each level

So, given 
PL = Player level
ML = Mob Level
HCB = High Con Bonus

(forgive the pseudo C notation, but it is the most
compact way to represent the formula)

HCB = (ML < Max(55,(PL-5)) ? 1 : (1.95+(.13 * (ML-PL+5))))

So, for a level 60
ML  HCB
54  1.00
55  1.95
56  2.08
57  2.21
58  2.34
...
65  3.25
67  3.38
...
70  3.90

For a level 55
ML  HCB
54  1.00
55  2.60
...
70  4.55

For a level 65
ML  HCB
59  1.00
60  1.95
...
70  3.25
