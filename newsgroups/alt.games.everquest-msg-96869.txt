I made a Dwarf Paladin on the test server to see the changes in action.

Went out into Butcherblock and committed suicide.

The safe point at was atop the hill directly in front of the gates of
Kaladim.

Tried to find the mob I was fighting but couldn't.

Started a fight with another mob. Pulled it to the safe point, intending to
get myself killed and bind rush it. Just to see if it could be done.

Died and respawned at safe point. The mob was nearby then it suddenly
disappeared. Just poof.

IIRC the mobs did not disappear when you died before the change.

Just something I was wondering..
