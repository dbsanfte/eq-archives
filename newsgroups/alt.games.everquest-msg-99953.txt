Or if you still wanted to play a caster, maybe consider an Iksar
shaman or Iksar necro; Iksar shamans have the highest base wisdom of
all the shaman races, and they can do the Haggle Baron armor quest for
armor like Iksar monks (Iksar necros can also do the quest, of course,
but they won't be able to wear the armor); the necro would likely solo
better than the shaman but the shaman can still solo decently (and can
travel easier than a cleric because of SoW/invisibility) and likely
can find groups easier than a necro.  If your shaman paired up with a
monk you guys would do great.
