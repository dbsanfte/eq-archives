Lower levels have a higher aggro radius, and more people means more chance for
idiots not paying attention. Fear is single groupable anyway nowadays, but
even when it wasnt taking in multiple people guarenteed someone getting ported
by the scarelings into a huge pile of critters, running them back and 
wiping everyone. A tight, efficient single breakin group can clear a 'safe
camp' for the others to come to without the inevitability of a horrendous
wipe.

Thats the theory, anyway ;)
