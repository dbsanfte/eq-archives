so many people fail to grasp this issue

to the guy bragging about his isp's free site - yea, you have a 6gb site, so
what?  if you get 20 hits a day, i am impressed.  alakazam's is getting
thousands and if his isp is anything close to mine, he is paying thru the
nose.

i spent money when he asked for donations, i subscribed now.  if he breaks
even, i will also be impressed, just hope he doesn't go under.
