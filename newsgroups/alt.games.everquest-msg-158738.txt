I'd have to agree with Berg here, a DS does not absorb an incoming
melee hit.  Each incoming melee hit is returned with a DS hit.  You
can verify that each hit gets through a DS by attempting to melee a
creature that has one.

However, to any wizard who finds this spell a useful means to take
down a creature - my cleric happily accepts donations for rezzes.
