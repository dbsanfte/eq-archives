Heheheheehe

Great example....

I have noticed that as well.

Lesa has changed her position from the beginning.  At the beginning
she said (or at the very least implied) that she is for full
disclosure..

But when pressed for the point, it slowly metamorphesised to, giving
very little specific information and telling the child, in effect, to
"wait til your older".

Which, ironically enough, was MY point from the beginning...
