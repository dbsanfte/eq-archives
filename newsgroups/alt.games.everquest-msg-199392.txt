Funny, we hunt 500+ hitter consorts, and now in PoV - and we never
bothered to ask if our Shammy had KEI yesterday.  We just grabbed him,
and set to work - he had no problems keeping up with constant pulls
of 400+ hitters with 15k+ hp - because he *GASP* used CANNI.

30 seconds?  You aren't running to PoK - getting a KEI then getting
back to the Hobgoblin caves, and getting several turns deep in them
in 30 seconds.  The moment you leave to refresh your KEI - we will 
replace your ass.

Well - we sure can't help it if you're incompetent, now can we.
You give up a huge part of your class (self mana regen as high
as anyone but a pet-canni mage) and you call him stupid?

Slow on incoming isn't always prudent - sometimes the MT just has
to soak for a few seconds while he gets aggro.  WTF do you think a
dress wearing enchanter does?  Was in a group with a 57 enchanter
the other day, I Malosinied on incoming, then she slowed after the
61 warrior had a few seconds to build aggro.

You could buff everyone, then canna down for your mana...............
Oh, wait, you're a completely incompetent shaman!  The shaman I group
with have zero problem taking care of their duties.

God I hope I never see you in one of my groups - your complete lack
of anything approaching competence in your class is amusing from a
distance, but we'd toss your ass in a heartbeat in one of my groups.
