Logged back onto Tribunal. Tried reloading the default UI. Skills
still don't show. Reloaded, using /loadskin, and still no skill list.

Might have to dump the character (after transferring the character's
immense wealth to the shared slots, like 12 plat and 20 malachite -
nearing 4th lvl) and recreate to see if reinitialize the UI. Have to
start at lvl 1 again, but other than the plat spent on lvl 1 spells,
nothing much else is lost.

Too bad, the plague rat tails got nerfed. I now consider leaving them
to rot since (due to limited storage slots) they don't stack and
things like rat eyes and snake jaws (worth twice as much) do. Maybe
they could make PRTs stackable?

Also noticed that the Inventory screen has a "Face" button which
brings up the image you get in character creation when you create the
face, hair style, hair color, and eye color. You also get the
subscreen which has all the buttons to adjust those features (as per
character creation). Didn't mess with it, but might just to see what
it would do, if I dump the character.

Merry Christmas, may the servers be stable.
