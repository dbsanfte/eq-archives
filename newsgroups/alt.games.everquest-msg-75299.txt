If you have or can get Kromrif Military Leggings, the Thurg legs aren't
worth it for druids.

Kromriffs have better saves, AC and weight, and the slight extra strength
and wisdom on Thurgs aren't really worth it, the 70 mana is nice, but not
necessary, and the effect is really kinda cheesy, Circle of the combines
would be more useful, I've never seen anyone shout for a port to misty.

I do agree with the bracer/helm/tunic assessment though.  Currently trying
to find a bracer MQ for sale myself.

I hadn't realized how nice the crown was before, maybe I should get one of
those instead... hehe.
