No.   Or at least not in this case.   Clicking a cobalt breastplate to heal
yourself at a raid would be pointless.  100 hp every 14 seconds won't make
any kind of a diffence in your fight... and if the fight is *that close*
that it would, you'd be much better off doing damage for those 14 seconds,
so the mob dies before you need 100 more hit points.
