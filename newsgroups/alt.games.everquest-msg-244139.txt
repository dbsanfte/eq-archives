I play a ranger.  I primarily use one button on mine: the big one on the 
far right is set to archery auto-fire.  I did go through and map the entire 
thing to have all my hotkeys, spells and such pretty handy.  But what I 
found was that now instead of just moving my right hand from the mouse to 
the keyboard to type a message, I now had to move both hands.  So most of 
the other keys are largely unused.

I do use it when two-boxing though, as I can keep the gamepad much closer 
than I can my laptop keyboard, so I don't have to reach nearly as far to 
hit my bot's hotkeys.

Is it worth it?  I think so, it's a nice piece of hardware and works better 
than the software auto-fires I've tried.  If you don't twobox and aren't a 
ranger (or some other class that requires a button press about every 1 
seconds), I'd consider returning it.
