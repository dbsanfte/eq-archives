I've read through this several times.  Do they honestly believe that anyone 
other than the most zealously devout would believe the "Look how much we've 
grown" followed by "We're consolidating servers because on some servers you 
can play without 'bumping into others'"?

It's insulting to a person's intelligence.

I notice in this version there's a section that's not included in the 
official release:

"Some people who don't play EQ2 will have bad things to say about this move. 
Yes, this is a controversial decision, but our primary concern has to be 
making sure that the worlds are all healthy, fun places to play for the 
people who enjoy playing EQ2.
Let me say that again:

Our existing players are our number one concern. Providing a good game 
experience for you is infinitely more important to us than anything else, 
including what this move will undoubtedly prompt outsiders to say. In time 
that will pass, and we'll all still be here playing and working on an EQ2 
that has server communities that are much better prepared for the bright 
future in store for them."

Please pass the Kool-Aid.
