LOL been playing EQ2 for 15 months and when is the so called shafted going 
to start.
It is better than WoW, Guildwars, City of Villian, SWG, and D&D online just 
to name
a few.  If anything EQ2 has got better over the past 6 months and tons of 
people coming
back.  We found the grass was not greener on the other side.

"> You mean like the people who didnt learn their lesson from EQ1 and spent
> their cash on EQ2 to later get shafted
