I'm not a big fan of much of America's foreign policy, which seems to 
consider that in the fight against Communism, things like civil rigts 
(Afghanistan) or democracy (Chile) are worth sacrificing.

But having said that, one of the saddest things about this whole 
situation is that Moslems worldwide seem to have selectively forgotten 
is that the US was the first to jump to the help of Moslems in Bosnia-
Herzegovina.
