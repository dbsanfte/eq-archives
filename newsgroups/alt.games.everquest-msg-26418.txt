Proximity is a big key.  How close are the mobs to each other, how close
do you have to get to attack, what else roams around the area....  All
these are important factors.  Trial and error are unfortunately the best
way to figure these things out and the error part can be costly if there
is no nearby zone line.  The Lull line of spells is not something you
can count on for soloing in my opinion.  Perhaps if you've a group to
help with overpulls it has a use, but I don't use it solo ever.  

You really will need to pick up a bow, don't worry about damage, look
for range, both on bow and arrows you make/buy.  You can minimize your
pull in some camps by pulling the mob who is farthest from the others in
the opposite direction.  Depending on proximity and agro area among
other things you may get the solo target or just a single add as opposed
to the whole camp if you are far enough away.  Once you can start
picking them off you can work towards getting the ones you couldn't at
first.  Even if you can't clear an entire camp you may be able to pick
singles from the fringes w/o ever disturbing the main grouping.

Its really something you need to get a feel for, both over all and as
regards a particular camp.  The same tactic that may work well in one
place can have the opposite results in another.  Oh, and let me say one
more time, get yourself a bow.  One of your lvl 22 spells works very
well in conjunction with a bow hehe, I'll let you figure out which one
on your own.
