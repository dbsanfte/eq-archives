You meant well.  You probably won't get in any trouble at all over it.

But you voilated a basic commmunity rule of EQ; don't help unless people 
ask for it.

OK, its not a rule, more a guideline.  But if you -do- help, you really 
want to do so in a way that interferes as little as possible with what 
is going on.  From least objectionable to most objectionable.

A heal is nice and you'll almost never see anyone complain about one.

Buffing people in the fight is nice and you'll rarely see anyone 
complain about that, although certain buffs can actually remove buffs 
that are better for some purposes, so you need to watch that.

Snaring, stunning, and even mezzing apparant adds are all decent, and 
you won't often see anyone complain about it, although each -can- screw 
up aggro, necro snaring can end up being very messy due to its DOT 
component, damage stuns can break mezzes and roots, and mezzing 
interferes with pet behavior.

Rooting can mess up aggro control, root with damage even more so.

Sending a pet in to deal with an add can overdo damage and lose them a 
kill, and can mess with their pet aggro, plus some pets have procs that 
can wreak havoc (but honestly, who plays with a 51+ fire pet anyway), 
but a pet won't break mez, making it a better option than:

Going in to melee or nuke yourself... Odds are good you'll end up KSing, 
simple as that.  Plus, you might be interfering with CC.
