In theory at least, same buff in different slots will stack.  With buffs 
such as strength it is easy to see, you look at your strength, and if it 
went up by the amount of both buffs, they must be stacking.  With haste, 
you would have to parse it.  All the other non pet-only haste buffs have 
the haste in slot 1, which is why they won't stack. Even the bard 
overhaste songs are slot 1, but, they are a different version of haste, 
and thus do stack.  In addition to the specific slot test, some buffs 
also have additional tests added to them for whether or not they will 
overwrite a spell, and whether or not they will block a spell.

Taking Focus of Soul as an example:
1:  Increase Max Hitpoints by 544 
2:  Increase HP when cast by 544 
4:  Increase STR by 75 
5:  Increase DEX by 70 
6:  Stacking: Overwrite existing spell if slot 1 is effect 'STR' and < 75 
7:  Stacking: Overwrite existing spell if slot 1 is effect 'DEX' and < 70 
8:  Stacking: Block new spell if slot 1 is effect 'STR' and < 1075 
9:  Stacking: Block new spell if slot 1 is effect 'DEX' and < 1070 

It will overwrite any spell with a slot 1 of <544 added max hp, slot 4 
less than 75 str, slot 5 less than 70 dex.  In addition, it will 
overwrite any spell with slot 1 str<75 or slot 1 dex<70, and it will 
block any spell that has slot 1 str<1075 or slot 1 dex<1070.

This is why Diaku which is STR in slot 5, DEX in slot 6 stacks with the 
focus line, but Maniacal Strength which is STR 68 in slot 1 will not 
stack with it, and Mortal Deftness which is DEX 60 in slot 1 will also 
not stack with it.

So, in theory at least, all components of Infusion of Spirit will stack 
with the Focus line, and with the haste line of spells, as well as the AC 
line of spells.  If you cast a strength buff on your pet, then cast a 
focus line spell, you will see the strength buff wear off immediately as 
it is overwritten.  I am not saying that the hastes do actually add 
together, I have never attempted to parse it, but, I am saying that it is 
possible, and certainly the spells do stack.  I am reasonably confident 
that the rest of the components of IoS do indeed stack with focus and ac 
buffs.
