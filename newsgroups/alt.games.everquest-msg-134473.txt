Well, since none of those things *prove* that one is an idiot, unlike top
posting, yes, top posting is worse.  It makes it nearly impossible to tell
who said what in quoted text, and it tends to make postings way too long.

20+ years, bottom posting has been accepted as the correct way to quote on
usenet?
