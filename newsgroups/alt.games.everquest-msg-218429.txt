There has always and will always be a double standard.  It's called
politics.  Doesn't make it right, it just makes it human nature.

I never had an issue with Clinton smoking pot, if he would have come
out and said that's what he did.  Instead he only put the smoke in his
mouth.  Basically he thinks I (and the US public) is so stupid as to
actually believe that.  It's insulting in the extreme.

Sake of his family?  Did he have a wife and child then?  Avoinding the
draft I have only marginal issue with if you think it's wrong.  My
issue with him is that he was protesting his own countries involvement
on foreign soil.  They hanged people for that historically.  Don't
like the war?  Come home and protest all you want.  Just don't do it
from another country.  And if that's the only way to avoid being
drafted then just keep quiet while your there.  I disagree with many
things our country does, but I will never side with another country
against the US.  Ever.

Ah hell, that was just the excuse to nail him sinnce they couldn't
manage it on the hundred other occasions.  They don't call him Slick
Willy for nothing.  And presidents throughout history have mislead to
engage in war.  Either because they though it was necessary to handle
it now rather than later, or because who knows.  It's not a new
concept.  And not always wrong in my opinion.  If this was nothing
more than payback for his dad, then it was wrong for intent.  But the
target was still right.

Never seen anything as bad or worse.  Bad yes, but who doesn't.
Worse?  Not by a long shot.

That's pretty apparent.
