This brings up another point I've been meaning to ask (and glad I don't 
have to start YET ANOTHER thread to do it). Do creatures have damage 
weaknesses? I'm fighting a lot of skeletons. Should I pull out my hammer 
instead of my sword even though the hammer has a bit slower delay? Are 
Skeletons less damaged by fire than say ice?

I've seen that I have fire/cold/etc resistances so I assume that 
creatures are the same way and that elemental damage is affected by the 
mob's resistance to that particular type of damage, but what about 
blunt/slash/pierce?
