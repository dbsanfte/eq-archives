...which kinda defeats your purpose, doesn't it? Actually, the "worst"
scenerios I can think of involves them surviving and becoming carriers
of diseases, overfeeding and destroying natural environments, and so
forth which, in my opinion, is far worse than things are now. The "no
better" scenerios are a long way behind that and far more likely than
you seem to think.

You've provided no substantial reason why it's wrong for humans to
feed off animals but not for animals that do the same when they can
survive off plants just as well...
