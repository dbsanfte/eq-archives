I like DVD cases as storage mediums, but not at the expense of a nice manual
if the game can benefit from it. I'm an old-school gamer who loves to sit
down with a good game manual and read it cover to cover. Rarely before I've
played it, usually after I've become familiar with the game's interface and
want to learn more about the game (stats, formulas, features, etc.).

It's not about *need*, because I agree with you, the game shouldn't need a
manual and the best ones don't. A manual should enhance the game as a
reference work and I don't want to have be tied down to my computer to
access it. When I'm at my computer I want to be playing, not reading
manuals. I always carry around something to read and it's a pleasure having
a well-written game manual to read.
