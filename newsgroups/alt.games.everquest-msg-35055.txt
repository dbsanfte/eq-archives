Let's see - a guy with a 31st lvl Warrior who doesn't know what Damage and
Delay are, who doesn't know how to find quest info for his race / class, who
doesn't have an idea of how much PP people have, who doesn't know what
kiting is, who doesn't know anything about languages, etc..

By themselves, they may be understandable, but in my book, all of these
things add up to either a purchased account or someone gave him the account.
Maybe AOL is now giving away EQ accounts when you sign-up.

Several of his questions are in-game questions, but are also the ones that
would give away that you obviously haven't played the game very much for the
level of your character.  I suggest he spend a couple hours on google doing
searches on all of his questions since he is obviously new to the game.

Or, at least start a thread on the stupid names people have and whether or
not they should be reported / petitioned.  That would at least be something
new and refreshing.  I report them.  How about you guys? *smack*  OW!

BTW, the only Strait I know, is George, and I can't stand Country music
shit.
