    Wanna know why?

    You're used to it now.

    When I first went 51-59, every part of it stank. Especially levels 51 to
54, which I did when we didn't have the blue XP line (watching the yellow
bar in 54 is like watching paint dry). When I hit 60, the XP seemed SO
EASY - but it was as slow as level 54 XP, more or less. I was just used to
watching the bar crawl along. When Rosy went through levels 51 to 53 it
seemed like the XP flew by - because Delores had been through 59 within the
past month, and I was still thinking in terms of "how many hours per blue".

    Some of it is gear (you're killing faster), some of it is knowledge
(you're fighting in better areas, with better tactics), but the majority of
it is you now being used to how slow the XP bar raises.

    James
