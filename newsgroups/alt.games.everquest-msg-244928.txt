Ah ... well then... that begs the question... why would you, knowing 
full well that you are seemingly unlikely to see most names on a regular 
basis (per your just described usenet habits), be inclined to accuse 
martin of being a lurker?

Now, to me, it appears as if you just effectively accused someone of 
being invisible because you hadn't seen them... and then defended your 
argument by describing a process whereby you look through the world 
through narrow blinders making it unlikely to see someone until they're 
right in your face. I think to anyone reading this the obvious 
conclusion is that you've just backpeddled your argument into absurdity...
