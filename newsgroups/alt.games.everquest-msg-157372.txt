Hmmm, Enchanters have been complaining about raid roles a bit lately,
and then there's that one wierdo who keeps whining about pointy hats
(which clearly should be WIZ only).  Not sure why Shamen are so quiet,
I have to wonder if they aren't quietly overpowered like Bards.  That
is, unlike Necros, there aren't 50 bazillion 12 year-olds bragging
about how awesome they are (I figure the Bard's "Code of Silence" is
actually a passive thing that just sort of happened), and pitching a
huge fit at every perceived "nerf".
