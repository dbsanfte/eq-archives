You missed the point... here I'll break it down more:

Suppose A earns 60,000, spends 30k on life, assuming 25% tax, that 
another 7.5k on his expenditures, leaving him with the following summary:

A - Eearns 60k, spent 30k, taxed 7.5k, has 22.5k in bank.

Now B earns 60,000, spends 30k on life, but unlike A, B has to buy his 
own business cards, has to purchase his own tools, and has to pay for a 
ton of materials, and this all cost him 20k.

So B's summary:

B - Earns 60, spent 30k + 20k, taxed 12.5k, and has run a deficit of 2.5k.

A and B both spent the exact same on life. But person B effectively 
makes 20k less than person A due to the expense of running his business, 
not only does person B have a smaller 'real' income because of his 
business expenses, but his tax bill is 5k -higher-! That's ridiculous.

A two people who lead an identical lifestyle in an spend-tax system 
should have an identical tax bill.

Someone else said that 'items not for final consumption' are not taxed, 
which leads me to the question... are tools and business cards, and 
lunches final consumption? I think they are so this guy gets screwed.

While Person C, who also makes 60, spends 30k on life, and spends 20k on 
running his business (but he happens to carve wood, and the unfinished 
wood is tax free), so his summary is 60k income, 30k on life, 20k tax 
free on bits unfinished wood, 7.5k tax bill, and and 2.5k left in the 
bank. So he too is down 5k in taxes under joe 'B' dimwit who's obviously 
is in the wrong line of work under this 'so-called' fairtax.

The -name- isn't important, the -amount- is. If I can increase my 
disposable income by taking tax free vacations, that's defiantely a perk 
to the wealthy and decidely 'unfair'.

The trouble wit that, and the reason they gave for not allowing it is 
that adminisering all the different tax rates brings rise to all the 
lobbying, red-tape, bureacracy, and other BS in the existing system that 
they are hoping to avoid in the first place.
