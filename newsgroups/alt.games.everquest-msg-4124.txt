Hey, us melee types love it too.  I hate that nagging feeling, when I'm
way out in the field doing something dangerous, that maybe I hadn't
gotten rebound the last time I was in town and might pop back to Thurgadin

It's like that awful feeling that you left the iron on back home
while halfway to Disneyland...

be).
