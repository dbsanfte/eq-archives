You know shit.  Here's how it works.  You pulled some incorrect
numbers out of your ass.  You were called on it.  Instead of admitting
you were wrong, you reached EVEN FARTHER up your ass and pulled what
you thought would be a trump, ie. you claimed that you worked for
Verant.  Unfortunately for you, everybodies bullshit detectors needled
over into the red and they called you on it.  And, once again, you do
not have the balls to admit you were bullshitting.

So basically, you've cut your own throat credibilty-wise.  Boo hoo.
