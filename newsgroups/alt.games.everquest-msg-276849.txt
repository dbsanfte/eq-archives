This sounds funny to me. After all I doubt that in Australia there are
reasons that "allow" for killing people!

And I hope even in China you aren't allowed to kill for *any* reason. :)
Therefore I don't see the slightest problem in this case. I hope I did
make my point clearer.

Since you mention virtual property I firmly believe that this should
stay virtual. There is no need to adapt the real life judical system to
the virtual reality. If the company maintaining this VR then the only
means to deal with "crimes" therein should be with the tools they provide.

And with the possibility to directly talk to the creator of these
realities it should be all that you'll ever need.
