What you can do is save your character data..and those interesting pics you
took...Because when you lose your character data all the preset buttons are
lost..all the hot buttons go back to like they were DAY ONE....All the rest
come from verant...even your equipment comes from verant...

I lost my Hard drive..I had to reset everything...hot buttons, friend list
and chats and personalized hot keys on the keyboard....
