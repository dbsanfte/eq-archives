Okay, so my pretty DE rogue is very pissed off, because he can't find a 
helmet that doesn't look ridiculous on him.  First the lieutenant's 
helm, which just looked kinda stupid.  Now the executioner's whatever, 
which makes him look like a complete and total moron.  Usually I could 
care less what my characters look like, as long as the stats are good, 
but my rogue is vain as hell, and wants to look a lot less like he put 
his cap on backwards that morning.  Are there any head items out there 
around the same price range or stats that *don't* have graphics?  And if 
there are - how the heck do you find out about them?

Ryou
