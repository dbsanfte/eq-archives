From http://www.sentry.org/~trev/essays/essay99-2b.html
"Until its recent amendment by the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online
Services) Act 1999 (Cth), the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) also made it an offence
to knowingly or recklessly use a carriage service provided by a carrier in
such a way as would be regarded by reasonable persons as being, in all the
circumstances, offensive.FN18 The Crimes Act now provides that this does not
apply to the use of a carriage service to carry Internet content.FN19 "

I did further research and it looks like the government might have moved
control of "obscene language" to the ISP's but I can't find a good database
of australian law to search in. I know for a fact that it still applies to
phone calls (regardless of whether it was between a married couple say!) and
there's probably some loophole whereby it applies to net traffic, but I
can't find it yet. Australian citizens have no "inalienable rights" per se,
as far as I am aware. There have been occasional attempts to pass a bill to
include rights as part of our constitution, but it has always been defeated
by the major parties.
