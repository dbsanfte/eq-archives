I think the issue here is that EQ is more or less a relatively pure
hack & slah game. While in a cardboard/non computer RPG an Ogre
with high INT will be able to end up in funny situations in
a non-computer game, it's nearly totally useless in EQ as
a warrior. The only reason for this is that you *want* a
suboptimal warrior. It hasn't got to do much with roleplaying,
or where does the computer game make you roleplay better, just
because you put all stats into a stat, that the game doesn't use
for warriors? Roleplay is your own acting in EQ anyway.
