oh I am sure they're educated too, but talk about annoying trying to
understand a whole sentence of incomplete words.  "plz" isn't much of a
bother, but couple it with a few others and yes i will ignore them.  you
forget, doesn't matter who someone is in the RL it is how they present
themselves in the game.  Trying to discover what someone is trying to say is
a bother.

and of course it is a "shock value" thing, and a "we are this generation"
thing.  I find it amusing and admire the creativity, no doubt, but still
find it impossible to read in a complete sentence.
