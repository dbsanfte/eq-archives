It depends on what sort of help you can get.
If you know a 50+ druid, who is willing to PL you, you could get from 37 to
46 in a few days.
To be honest, I have only done 37-46 once, with my Paladin, and I cant
remember how long it took.
Im at 42 now with my bard, who is doing a level a night (about 5-6 hours),
but that is charm/chant kiting, which wouldnt be an option for a warrior.
You could easily make 46 inside a month playing every night though.
Echo Caverns would be a good place to check out, and you can sometimes even
get a pickup group there, although I wouldnt rely on it.
