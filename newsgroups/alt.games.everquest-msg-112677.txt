I just had the pleasure of helping out a druid with a couple of her epic
drops.  First we went to EJ, waited for another guild to get two corrupted
Gorillas, then got hers withing 5 minutes of the other guild finishing.
Then, it was off to LoIO for the one camp I was seriously dreading.  After 3
spawn cycles, that's 18 minutes or so, tainted, then corrupted, and one very
happy druid.  I got to bed in time to get a good nights sleep.

Please don't hate me.  :)
