He did say so. The OP:

SOE closed my accnt cause my bank balance got too low but when I fixed
that
and deposited cash now their screen says server error when I try to
reopen
it, Im switching to FF XI or WoW now, SOE can kiss my ***.

Note, the "now the screen says server error" part. Is he overreacting?
Sure. But if he's not happy with the game (for whatever reason) he
shouldn't play. And you should read posts before you yell at people for
not saying something that they did, actually, say.
