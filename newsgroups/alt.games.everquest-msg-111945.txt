LOL!

Looks like you have the "min" spec machine to run with max settings.
It is good to hear that it is possible. 

I wonder if there is some way to determine which piece of hardware
does the most good (CPU, RAM, Video Card). My gut feeling is that they
would rank as follows:
1. Video Card (128mb DDR)
2. RAM (1gb is 2x recommended specs)
3. CPU (When I upgraded to a 1.2gz from 900mhz I noticed very little
difference in EQ)
