1.  No drop isn't the answer.  Royal velium armor is no drop, wanna
know how many twinkies in the teens and 20's have them?  No drop is a
brain-dead bandaid over a bullethole wound.

2.  There's nothing wrong with twinking.  Twinking is something that
should be left in this game.

3.  If you REALLY wanted to stop twinking, the answer is very simple:
Take a look at the Club of the Ice Ocean.  You cannot *EQUIP* it until
you're level 50.  In otherwords, the neccessary mechanism to eliminate
twinking is already available to Verant.  But they have chosen
(correctly I might add) to not implement it across the board (why
single out the turtle club, I have no idea...it's not that great of an
item anyways).
