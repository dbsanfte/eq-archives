    First, a "my bad" correction. Dungeons were 85, not 100. Seeing the
listing that you found reminded me of that.

    When you read the person's description of what he did, he indicates he
only experimented on certain high-level zones and that more testing by
others would be required. That would be why most zones are missing.

    There's two interesting things in that post. One is the ZEMs for the
planes in PoP - they almost double the XP you'd get from a normal outdoor
zone. The other part is the level modifier formula he uses. Assuming it's
correct, then when fighting level 62 golems in Valor you have an additional
(at level 65): (260-13x[65-62])/100 = 2.21 modifier to all XP earned. So,
the overall XP modifier is massive. Compare:

Juggs in Sebilis, at level 65: 85 x 58 x 58 = 285,940 XP before
group/class/race modifiers
Golem in PoV: 145 x 62 x 62 x 2.21 = 1,231,810 XP before group/class/race
modifiers

    When you factor in that the golems and the Juggs have similar HPs, just
different damage outputs, it becomes obvious where you want to XP. Over four
times the XP? Ouch.
