I say "no problem" when what I've done strikes me as trivial effort on my part.
Say clicking a rez stick on a body thats been delivered at my feet while I'm not
busy.  Lots of spanish in school and a few months in mexico makes me think of
"de nada" as a proper response to thanks anyway.

I say "you're welcome" when what I've done actually took effort, and I'm not
embarassed to recieve acolades for having done so.  If I crossed several zone
lines or moved thru hostile terrain to get to that body, it may no longer have
been "no problem"

Then again, if they are a good friend (or high paying customer) then its back to
"no problem, happy to do it" even if it -was- a problem, sometimes, I'm saying
doing it for them was far more satisfying than the trouble it took.
