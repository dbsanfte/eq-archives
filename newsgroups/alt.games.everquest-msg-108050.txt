the old NVidia drivers were suggested to me before several times. i was
confident my system was clean of them. all nv*.* files gone, all registry
entries for any video device other than the Radeon gone, etc.

framerate in just about everything was excelent. my 3DMark2001se score
almost trippled, my framerate in Quake 3 with all settings maxed and at the
highest resolutions my monitor supports (1280x1024) was almost 200fps
running around...

its just in EverQuest, framrate was about half that of the GF2MX200 for me.
and i know its not just me, as I saw on the EverQuest forums at
everquest.com, that a LOT of ATI owners complain about the framerate too.

when i took the card back, the guy at the store said he heard about a lot of
people having EverQuest problems with the Radeon 8500 as well.
