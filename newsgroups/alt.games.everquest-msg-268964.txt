Mmmm... Actually I was referring to wearing guild uniforms and having a 
'must show guild tag at all times' policy as "asinine heard mentality". 
Simply choosing to wear your tag wouldn't qualify as asinine.

I'd like to qualify this with the context being the case of an 
individual who feels compelled to perform, as he described it: worthless 
repetitive and endless activities for the 'reward priviledge' to display 
it.

Simply turning your tag on or off in EQ1 could easily be regarded as a 
token show of support, passive recruitment, and so on. But that is not 
the case here. This individual is advising against playing EQ2 entirely 
(one of his 'three reasons to stay in EQ1') based on the fact that 
showing his guild tag is too much work.

I maintain that its a pretty irrelevant complaint. And any attempt to 
blow it up into a reason not to even play the game is weighing the value 
of wearing a visible guild tag well beyond the scope of 'passive 
recruitment' and 'token show of support' and into 'validates my 
existence' territory.

Technically even altruism can be ascribed to selfishness. This tangent 
really doesn't have a satisfactory ending.
