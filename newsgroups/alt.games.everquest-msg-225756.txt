Do only warriors get this, or is it every class with the taunt skill? 
Its sorely needed, since taunt fails more often than not, and knowing 
whether it did or not should greatly increase its utility.  But paladins 
and SK aren't suffering from lack of aggro control, if it was warrior 
only it could be a partial redress of this problem.

WHIle it might sound weird for the same skill to work differently on 
different classes, consider the rogue, which gets a success message on 
hides and sneaks, and which is the only class to get the combination of 
hide+sneak to allow invis to everything live and dead while mobile.  Or 
consider ranger tracking, Far more utility to it not just because of the 
greater range due to a higher skill cap, but because of the extensive 
sorting options.... yet it looks like the same skill that druids and 
bards get.

4% doesn't sound like enough to matter; if you have a 5000hp warrior and 
a 5000hp paladin standing side by side tanking identical mobs, and the 
paladin not using any of his paladinly abilities, the warrior only takes 
4800 damage in the time the paladin takes 5000, or in other terms, the 
warrior effectively has 5200 hp.

In similar gear, warriors already have an HP advantage on approximately 
this level, this will double that, now the warriors will have about 5400 
hp effectively... but the paladin will still have far better aggro 
generation, and will be stunning the mob to the point where he'll 
probably do better than 4% mitigation, and will have heals and buffs and 
better stun interrupt and an emergency LOH and failing that, can rez you 
after a disaster (not to mention having Lull to help avoid disaster in 
the first place.  The warrior, on the other hand, is capable of... hmm, 
I forget, what are the extras a warrior brings to the table?

Once upon a time, warriors averaged around 20% better HP than knights, 
and I think you'd have to see gear or mitigation or something bringing 
this level of differentiation back before you'd see enough difference to 
make "hmm, well we could take the warrior and rely on more efficient 
CHeals instead" as a plan.
