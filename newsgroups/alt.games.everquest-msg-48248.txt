As has been stated already, it doesn't work (in any PvP situation) but it
wouild be nice if maybe it actually did an opposed test, your FD skill
versus the opponents intelligence, to give the impression the player is dead
(ie it comes up with A_Monk001's Corpse) and if the test is failed the
fallen to the floor message is given.
Wouldn't be good idea against int. casters but might be useful against
trolls, ogres or even barbarians.
Just a thought. Not likely to ever have been considered for implentation.
Besides, the player themselves would (likely) know they hadn't actually
killed the other player and so starts a waiting game, or, as I think someone
said before, you cast an AOE spell on yourself or another target nearby so
as to still hit prone player.
