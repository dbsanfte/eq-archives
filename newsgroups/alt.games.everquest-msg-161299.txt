The quotes in my signature are usually things I find philosophically
interesting, even if I do not agree with them entirely - not to say that I
don't believe the original quote that led to the flames.

I don't have a problem with other people's opinions, in fact, I prefer that
other people have their own beliefs. I'd like to see a world where people
can speak freely anywhere, however, that is not our world. People are too
easily offended and disturbed. As such, I understand that most people would
rather not see my rantings on society.

If I recall correctly, once I clearly marked a post as "off topic" and
ranted - yet people still complained. People don't want to think, Navarro.
They want to lock themselves in a dark closet with their eyes and ears
covered. I acknowledge that, and I will not stand in the way of their bliss.
