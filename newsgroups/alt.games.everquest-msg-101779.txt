    Debuffer, since all your debuffs seem to stack with everything else.
Group buffer, since the Luclin debuffs also buff your group. I was in the
CHeal group when we did Creator last night, and our necromancer kept our
health up (from the AoE DoT and from mod rodding) with Zevfeer's. He didn't
twitch us once. His pet was also in the fight, whacking away until the DoT
ate it.

    Only ever heard of necros being used to pull over monks in Veeshan's
Peak. But it seems pretty standard there.

    Our enchanters fight over this. :-)

    Mind wrack? A toy? To use a line from Saturday Night Live, "Hippie, you
ignorant slut." Let's look at last night's CHeal group: Necro, Mage, three
clerics. Assume nobody makes a specialization roll. Necro, partways into the
fight, casts Mind Wrack (-600 mana). The effect takes place (+1500 mana, 300
for each person). Each cleric can cast one additional Complete Heal with the
mana gained (-3x400 mana = -1200 mana). The mage casts one more Rod of
Mystical Transvergence (-400 mana), which is eaten (+660 mana, -900 HPs).
Net effect: the main tank lives for three more CHeals (on a slowed Creator,
that's 30 seconds), 900 HPs are lost, and the net cost of all this is *40*
mana. That's huge.

    The ATK buff/debuff looks better. Our tanks are above the AC soft cap,
so more AC won't help much. But decreasing the damage output of the target
AND getting the increased damage output of a group with ATK buffed up is a
big help. Parses with Avatar (+100 ATK) on high AC mobs indicate the damage
output increase can be as high as 50% - every point of ATK helps.

    Of all the DoTs a necromancer has the one I want to see on the mob is
Cessation of Cor. Debuffs >>> damage.
