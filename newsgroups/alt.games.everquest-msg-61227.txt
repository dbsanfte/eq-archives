I'm new to this game and am on my first character. I, too, am playing a
Paladin in Greater Faydark and have worked my way up to 6th level,
mostly through soloing. I'm having a great time. I really enjoy the solo
hunting, but know that to continue I need to group up with some people
or I'll spend the rest of my life in the woods. I love the battles at
the Orc Camp. I spent most of my early days learning the paths and
terrain of the forest so that I could survive alittle easier, but I have
learned to stay out of Lesser Faydark, and am having trouble in
Butcherblock. However, I'm sticking with this character because I'm
having so much fun.
