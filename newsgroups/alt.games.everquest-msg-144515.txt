Couple of nice shields to get for a few plat are Sarnak Battle Shield (about
600pp) or a Crystal Chitin Shield (+9wis about 2000pp)

Or if your over 40th level and have a decent guild or about two groups of
high level friends try to get the Shield of Bane Warding (+20 wis, quest in
Katta Castellum - very nice shield),  best I've seen short of raid level
gear,  and it is droppable if you ever need to sell it or if you can
convince your guild to get it for you.
