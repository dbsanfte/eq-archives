I stand up myself and agree: Rangers are kinds of cousins but also 
my prefered group fellows, as a Druid: not as much complementary as  
other class associations, but totally independant self-buffers 
working so well together with many similar spells. Ranger do the 
tanking while Druid overbuffs, does extra crowd control and heals.
