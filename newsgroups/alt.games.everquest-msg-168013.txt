It's part of the 9th coldain ring quest described here:
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1290

It's the part with Doldigun's Head. Basically when you trigger the event 
giants start spawning in pairs and you need to kill them. I'd say drop 
rates of armor here are about the same as in arena but here you only get 
plate. If you want thurg plate this is the best way that I've seen to 
get it.
