If it is as some have said in this thread that it is a marketing thing
against future and current competitors (basically, making losses less known
and concealing traffic information from competitors), that's fine and
understandable.  However, I hope that Verant knows that now whenever they
claim X amount of active players, the media should and can rightly question
those numbers and express doubt according to their validity.  For you cannot
have it both ways.  You either keep the pie or eat it.  Hopefully, Verant's
PR people made this known that the competitive analysis meeting where hiding
the numbers was discussed.
