Teen Charged in Firecracker Attack on Dog

Crime: Suspect, 19, pleads not guilty to felony explosives and animal cruelty
counts. Canine was found tied to a stake, with half its jaw blown off.

From a Times Staff Writer

A Los Angeles teenager has been charged with illegally possessing explosive
devices and igniting a powerful firecracker that blew off part of a dog's jaw.

Gil Raul Delara, 19, pleaded not guilty Wednesday to 12 felony counts,
according to Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County
district attorney's office.

Delara is accused of 11 counts of recklessly possessing a destructive device
and explosive in public and one count of animal cruelty. He was in County Jail
in lieu of a $500,000 bail. He is scheduled to appear in Compton Superior
Court on Jan. 9.

The dog was taken to a veterinary hospital where he was euthanized, according
to Officer Jack Richter, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department.

Richter said the dog, which appeared to be a German shepherd, lost its lower
jaw in the explosion. He said bomb squad officers responding to a call from a
citizen found the animal tied to a stake in an alley in the 10400 block of
Hickory Street on Dec. 30.

"How can anybody be so cruel?" Richter said.
