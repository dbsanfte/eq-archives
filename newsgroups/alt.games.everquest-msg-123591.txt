Uh-huh.  And would you feel the same way if they'd ported in
and saw only four people there?  Every guild I know would
waltz right past four people..

You can't *camp* Ragefire.  You *can* beat other guilds there
by having a killing force present.  Like I said, "camping"
him is useless;  you either have the force there to kill him
or another guild that does will take him.

You criticized the OP for going when the original "camper"
had four people in zone.  I don't think anyone thinks four
people are a force capable of taking Ragefire.  (I'd guess
it's barely possible, with a 60 warrior, a cleric and a
couple of manaburn wizards hoping for crits but no one
would seriously consider that a kill-capable force IMO.)
