I would have to disagree with this .. the wounds are fatal IMHO .. it
is just a matter of time before this game dies .. the mistakes were
compounded by no one listening .. situation normal really ... look at
their solution .. a high end guild love in .. which produces highend
solutions when they admit their player base is ten lvls below ..
lauaghable.
