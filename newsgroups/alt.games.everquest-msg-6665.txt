I would go to CT and go down to hunt the gators, they spawn faster and
you are more likely to get into a group.  This is where I got my
components for the focus items, a ring for the circlet of mist, and the
torn pages for my the epic quests.  I believe CT to be faster, I got all
4 pages (actually 5 dropped and I saw 5 focus components drop in that
time) in 4 hrs a friend of mine took 3 days in Najena to get the the 4
torn pages.

I hope this helps.

Remember these items only work with your summoning spells lvl 34 and up.
