To get one skill up over 50, you must put a point in EACH specialization
skill,
The one that goes over 50 first is the one that caps at 200
All the others will be capped at 50,
If you made a wrong choice in which skill to go over 50,
there is a guy in the Sol Ro Temple that will erase all specialization.

Hope this helps
