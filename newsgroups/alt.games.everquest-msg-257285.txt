But at all points after OoW, the effect is no longer going to be as
significant, and may in fact be a downgrade as it is for most epics
right now, excepting a very few (beastlord, cleric, maybe one or two
more). The mudflation is in fact what proves my point - the epic
effect will become redundant after that point.
