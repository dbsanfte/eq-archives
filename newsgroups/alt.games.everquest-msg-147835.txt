Personally, by the time I could do this one, I already had Lupine Claw
gaunts off the Werewolf Talon quest... easier kill, better reward, just very
rare

> many of the newbie armor quests
some are better than others... Rivervale Rogue weapon is very good...
Freeport Rogue weapon sucks ass!

> Various Classes Epic.
Some of the stuff needed for Epics is also very nice... eg Ghoulbane,
Pegasus cloak (not just for Mages)

> SkyShrine Quest Armor
> Thurg Quest Armor
> Rallic pack
> Trueshot Bow (Rangers)
At the level you can do it, Trueshot is great.... shame the Raincaller
upgrade is so weak

> Nostrolo's Tamborine Quest (Bards)
> Coldaine Prayer Shawl
> Jboots
> Stein of Moggok
> Karana's Tear Earring
> Staff of the Wheel Quest

Xanths/Solstice earrings... especially for Druids, but just the FT1 Solstice
Ear isn't too shabby a reward either

split half and half between Warriors and Militia, or you'll end up KoS to
one side

> Rat teeth in kerran isle
>
> Cash quests :
> Bandits in WK / Qyenos

GLS/Concordance quest... DE Smith in S Ro gives same faction boosts as
Neriak Library Wine quest as a bonus
