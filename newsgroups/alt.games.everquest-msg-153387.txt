Having had a couple of bad "bot" experiences, my rule of thumb now is
simple (tho rarely applied, don't do pickup groups often):
If any group member(s) seem unusually quiet try to figure out if
they're botted.  If, after a bit of observation, they seem obviously
botted it's time for "sorry, gotta run, guildmate needs help" (and
since some guildmate somewhere almost always needs help, this isn't
even a lie, heh).  If I can't tell, then either it's not a bot, or
the player is sufficiently skilled that it doesn't matter.
