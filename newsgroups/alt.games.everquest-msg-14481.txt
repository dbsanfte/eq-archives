}Assuming that the average PC is expected to recognize such things,

Which is quite an assumption.  The average _new_ NPC has never seen 
anything anyone is wearing.  He gradually learns to recognize various 
things.  Usually, by either inspecting someone, by asking someone 'what 
the heck is that X you're wearing?', or by getting a new X, trying it on, 
and hitting f9.  You can also find out some stuff from various websites, 
like the fashion pages at Allakhazam's.  But it's ludicrous to expect that 
_anyone_ has managed to memorize the graphics and names of _all_ of the 
items available, much less that the average player has done so.  

I'll be particularly unfamiliar with the stuff for classes I don't play, 
and I'll have very little idea how a lot of the gear I'm used to looks on 
races I don't play.  And I'd like to know... so why not just ask... 

}no it isn't. It's more like passing someone on the street and saying
}"Nice shearling lambskin coat." I don't need to tear it off his back
}to do that. 

I would.  For all I know about fashion, it's mohair.  Gosh, is that dress 
rayon, dacron, nylon, or a cotton blend?  I'd have to check the tag.

}And any response to an uninvited inspection is like
}stopping people that glance at you on the street, grabbing them by the
}lapels and screaming WHAT THE FUCK ARE <YOU> LOOKING AT? in their
}face.

Sometimes, that becomes necessary.  Although I'd compare it more to merely 
staring back with an odd expression on your face.  But people may vary in 
the vehemence of their responses.

}If you don't want people inspecting you, don't wear your nice gear and
}they won't.

Ahh, a workable, sensible solution, I like it.  Not.  Next you'll tell me 
a woman who was raped was probably 'asking for it' because she dressed 
provocatively.

}By the way, I always ask first... and I've never been told "no,"
}however if I <was>, it sure as hell wouldn't stop me from looking
}anyway.

It would stop me.  But as long as one asks, I have no problem with it.
