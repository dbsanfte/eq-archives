erm... what does it have to do with E'Ci? erm... absolutely nothing. In
fact, you are the first person to have mentioned E'Ci on this thread. 

The original post was:

If Vane have taken down Vyemm and Vuulak, then grats to them too. It's
an outstanding achievement.

Please take your resentment at other's accomplishments back to the
cesspool of false entitlement on E'Ci where it belongs.

After weeks of hard hard work, we have finally battled our way through
the hardest zone in the game. Yes, I'm bragging, because I'm *damn*
proud of it. Only 8 guilds have ever taken down Vuulak and *all* the
named nToV dragons, I believe, and some of them didn't complete the zone
'as intended' instead using gimp tactics to just take out Vuulak and
leave Vyemm and others. Sorry if you don't like to hear me bragging, but
I'm stocked ):oP
