Well, half elf has 5 less STR, 5 less STA, 15 more AGI, 10 more DEX, 15 less
WIS, same INT, same CHA, now which one makes a better druid?  Sure humans
are nightblind, but you get around that eventually.  It's that 15 points of
WIS that really jump out at me.  If you look at what are the primary stats
for a druid according to VI, then the order of preference would be Halfling,
Human, Wood Elf, and last of all, Half Elf.  If you look at WIS alone, then
it's Halfling, Human and Wood Elf, and last of all, Half Elf.  So, maybe I
missed something, what makes a Human druid worse than a Half Elf druid?
