Meh, who cares really... yeah the guy had the name for a long time but
really, it's only a game and a name.  Nothing worth getting all fussy
about.  I had to chuckle though reading through that thread, page after
page of people saying how shitty sony is and that the gms are all a
bunch of pricks etc.  The one thought I kept having is 'why do you
people continue to play then?'  I mean if the customer service is so
bad, and gms suck etc...

Having never had an issue which required a gm, I can't comment on
this... I'm sure there are a few bad apples in the bunch much like
everything else in real day life.  Simply accept it or move on.
