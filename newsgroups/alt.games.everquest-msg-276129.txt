Does he have a firewall that maintains a checksum table of all
applications that can access the net? After the patch the eqgame.exe or
something might have changed which will be detected by such a firewall.
Unless he confirms the change to the firewall it will block the access.
Maybe it is set up so it won't ask for any confirmations though.
