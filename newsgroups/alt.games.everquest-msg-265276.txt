Although you can't expand EQ to cover both monitors, you can play on one and 
have maps/guides/stats/etc open on the other (works best if you play in you 
normal Windows resolution).  To change something on the second monitor, 
you'll need to pop into windowed mode and release the mouse cursor, but it 
can be done, and can be quite beneficial.

In non-EQ use, multiple monitors are awesome.  I added a second a year or so 
ago, and don't see myself ever going back.  As 2 quick bits of advice 
though, if you can, get 2 monitors that are identical- makes it a bit easier 
on the eyes to switch back and forth- and get a monitor managing program 
like UltraMon to give you a little more control over things like window 
placement, your task bar, etc.
