Not surprising at all, taunt is a skill with a skill check.  If taunt is 
successful, it places the taunter at the top of the hate list, if not 
successful, it does nothing.  So, if you succeed first time, you are 
golden, if not, you try again, since there is no message to indicate a 
success, you just have to either keep checking via /assist, or, assume it 
worked after some set number of tries, like 3.  There are other 
variables, level of mob, and amount of hate to overcome seem to affect 
the liklihood of taunt success.

In LDoN, where mobs don't hit all that hard anyway (except for hard 
missions, and boss mobs maybe), and the mob should already be slowed 
anyway, hit taunt once, start whacking.  Worst case, chanter or shaman or 
bard gets smacked a couple times.  Mobs need to die fast though, so it's 
best not to waste time on lots of taunting.  Best bet is a pally or sk MA 
who can grab aggro NOW.
