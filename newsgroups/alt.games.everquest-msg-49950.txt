Honostly I don't think it would be possible to "fix" the tradeskills in EQ
retroactively.  I think EQ players simply have to accept that tradeskills
are not a useful functional part of the game and that the economy, what
there is of it, is for the most part not driven by the players.

This doesn't make it a "bad" game, but does go a long way in defining the
type of game that it is.  I believe Verant made a valient attempt with the
trade skills, but a few oversights caused them to fail, and fail they have
in that regard.

Although I haven't actually played the PvP game yet, I have to disagree with
this.  DAoC isn't a PvP based game.  I've played for an average of 5  hours
a day for the last three days (bows head in shame).  I've have been hunting
mobs, doing quests, and practicing tradeskills (the latter two things being
MUCH more rewarding than they ever were in EQ) and haven't given much
thought at all to PvP.  I've been defining my character's personality and
developing him, just like all the other MMORPGs.  There IS a PvP element to
the game, but to say that it is PvP *based* is simply unfair and untrue.

PvP is designed for the high level players.  I thought it was an excellent
idea.  When your character maxes out and can't really progress anymore in
level or stats, then he still has something meaningful to do.  He *still*
doesn't *have* to participate in PvP.  He could continue like level 60 EQ
characters, running around hunting for high end items and such, or he could
retire.  The PvP thing is simply an additional element for people who want
to participate in it.

As far as a lack of PvP balance, predetermined results etc... that has all
yet to be determined as very few people are participating or even giving
much thought to PvP yet.  Perhaps they did in Beta, I don't know, but if you
look at the explosive rate at which DAoC is growing, it is fair to say there
is no telling how PvP is going to turn out.

As to class balance, especially in PvP;  again, it is too early to tell, but
I'd still be inclined to agree with you.  There probably *are* class balance
problems.  Likely severe ones, and as they arise and become apparant, they
will be fixed.  Name me one graphical MMORPG that *hasn't* had severe class
balance issues.

I understand that when relics are captured there is a power shift that
affects the entire realm, but the effect is not really that severe.  Only
enough so to give a little meaning to the relics.  However, you are right in
that many people may not like this.  You are not the first person I've heard
express distaste for that particular aspect of the game.   As I have said
before DAoC has made many changes to the baseline that was established by
EQ.  Many will like the changes and many will not.  For those who don't, EQ
is still a great game by any standard.

Best Regards
