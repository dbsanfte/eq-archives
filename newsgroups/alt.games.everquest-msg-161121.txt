Yes, you pretty much do, but its possible to do it in the high 50s with only one
chanter, idea being that losing one chanter gives you one more damage producer
instead.

At 20, you NEED 2 chanters, and from them get basically the risk level you'd see
that 50s' group has with one chanter... too many resists and boom, dead chanter,
boom boom dead everyone else.  Course at 20, who cares?

ps OP suggested an AE group with Zero chanters.  You do the math.
