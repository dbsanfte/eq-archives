Lately I've seen all these offers on the net about "making big money in EQ,
using our exclusive techniques"  What is the bottom line on earning cash in
EQ? What is the most efficient way?

>>Kill Giants in Rathe Mountains! 1k plat/ 4-6hours easily.  But you gotta'
be around 40s. For the younger kids, I did the same thing when i was 10-20.
Kill stuff save 4-8 stacks of bone chips and sell them to higher necros,
etc, etc, etc.  As far as these "exclusive techniques"? IMO, just a big
rip-off. Wish I would have thought of it sooner...
