Someone mentioned D&D's system of memorization, where you get a strictly
structured level-based chart of how many spells you can use and how many
times you can use them.  There's an alternate system in one of their
expansions that works as follows:

1) Each spell costs a certain number of points to memorize based on its
level.  Weenie first-level spells are 1 point each, second levels are 2 or
3, etc, up to 50+ for the ninth level Atomic Blast-type spells.

2) A wizard can memorize a number of points' worth of spells that increases
as he gains levels.  A high level wizard could therefore cast a hundred tiny
spells, or half a dozen big ones, or a combination.

3) By leaving "free" points (i.e. not allocating them to specific spells
each day like you have to normally), a mage can cast any spell he knows, but
did not memorize, at double cost.

Thus, a mage could easily cast those spells he had prepared beforehand, and
in a pinch he could cast any spell he knows at extra cost.  It would be easy
to adapt a system like this to EQ: You use your 8 gems (or maybe you'd have
to leave one empty) for spells you know you'll need and use constantly, and
others you could cast off the cuff at additional cost.
