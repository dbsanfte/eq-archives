This is not true. As long as your combine isn't trivial your skillup rate
is only affected by your highest appropriate stat (wis/int for all skills,
dex for fletching, str for smithing).

When doing combines for skillups like Minotaur Hero's Brew successes don't
really matter. For other skills like smithing or jewelcrafting with bigger
resale values you should stick to combines close to your skill level
however.
