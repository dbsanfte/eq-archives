This was a good post.

Not only did you tell me what to think and insult someone who has 
contributed more to this group than you have to the world in general, but 
you also kept the prose concise and succinct so as not to exhaust your 
limited vocabulary. I particularly(partikully?) liked the fourth-grade 
"probally", the third-to-second-person mid-sentence perspective swings, the 
overall lack of punctuation, and the 275-point-oops-I'm-out-of-vowels-
playing-Scrabble character name.

Please keep posting! I am anxiously awaiting your next insight.
