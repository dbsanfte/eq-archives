Doesn't need much range on dispel when you can occlusion, snare, and
dispel, all while running at selo speed. The ton of hitpoints is a
nuisance, but not a disaster.

Also, there aren't always 2 of them. Quite frequently in fact, there is
only 1. I believe one of the tactics bards use is to simply ignore one of
the protectors. They do NOT have perma-sow. They are druids, and cast sow
on themselves. You can definately tell the difference in their running
speed when they spawn mid-raid and don't buff vs when a raid is breaking in
and they have had time to buff themselves.

I imagine it only works really well if you have the SSS, and Jboots or a
velious PoG/Quest breastplate for the free song of travel. Not enough of a
bard expert to know the details.

Not really a friend, and I've known or heard of MANY bards who have done
this.
