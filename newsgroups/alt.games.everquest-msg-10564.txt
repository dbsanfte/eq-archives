Ah, you must have never met our old friend, the former King Shocker
before. He's been 'trolling' around aghl for quite a while now.

Poor fellow's quite mad, I'm afraid.

We've tried everything from long hypnotic sessions to shock therapy,
without apparent result. Some argue it might be best to simply ignore the
poor guy, since helping him is obviously beyond anything we can do. I
tend to agree.

In short, ignore or killfile him and live with it...argueing will not
help : )
