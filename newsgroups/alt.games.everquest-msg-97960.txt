Yes, sad to say that my Familiar is always in front of me when I cast. The
problem is cured (just about) when I'm using a SoW potion though, as my
Familiar tends to left behind, so those spells that boost the Familiar speed
might never get used by me! Thank you for your input on the matter though ..

Kind regards ...

Stevie.
