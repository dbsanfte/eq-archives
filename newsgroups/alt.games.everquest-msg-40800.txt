This morning when I tried to log on I was greeted with a file update, I
thought ok let's see what good this does.  I waited patiently and then tried
logging on again after it was done updating itself.  Now after I hit the "I
Accept" button I get an "error opening packed file system (eqfeart8.pak)!"
message, whatever that means.  Things were fine yesterday.  Any ideas on how
I might fix the problem, without reinstalling the game?  Thank you.
