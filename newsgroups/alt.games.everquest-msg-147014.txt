Okay, thanks.

P3-600, 256 MB RAM, nVidia TNT2 w/32 MB (you may now laugh)

I'm thinking of doubling the RAM to 512 MB and replacing the
nVidia TNT2 w/32 MB with GeForce4 Ti4200 w/64 MB.  I believe
these upgrades would cost me about $200 which seems reasonable
as long as I can get another year out of the system that way.

My big fear is that I'd be CPU bound and STILL not be able to
use the new UI and higher resolutions.  I *think* I'm mostly
bottlenecked by the video card right now but I can't say that
the CPU isn't being a bottleneck too.
