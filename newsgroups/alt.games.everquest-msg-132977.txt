}and overwhelmed...  Congrats...

Now, I can't speak for -all- two year olds, perhaps yours is defective in 
some way.  But most two year olds -I've- met could easily achieve both.

}Now, the only contention is what can a 2 yr old "handle"??
}Lesa's 2 yr olds appear ready for quantum mathematics and Stephen
}Hawking's View Of The Universe Theory As It Pertains To Time Travel
}I doubt the average 2 yr old is ready for such concepts...

The only thing keeping them from being ready is your unwillingness to 
teach them.

}I wouldn't have expected personal attacks from you.

NOONE EXPECTS THE... oh, sorry, wrong movie.

}Why isn't there ANYONE who can debate w/o resorting to personal
}attacks??

If you feel that way, it's usually a sign that you're being overly 
sensitiveabout what you consider a 'personal attack'.  Lesa and I are 
frustrated because you keep saying 'A', and we say 'no, B', and then you 
say 'but still, A, wouldn't you agree??' and we say 'no, B', and you say 
'ohh, but I can tell you really mean A, and that contradicts where you 
said B, so which is it??' so we explain that although B has a resemblance 
to A, it is fundamentally diffeent, and we still insist on B.  If you have 
to explain a simple concept like B 12 times, you begin to suspect that you 
are agruing with a two year old yourself, and wish they could have told 
you that up front so you could break it down into simple, bitesize pieces 
that they may grasp.

But mostly, I saw an opportunity to use the word 'trephanate', and went 
for it. :)

}You think?  And, of course, you have PROOF of this, correct??  
}Or are you simply stating YOUR opinion?

I neither feel the need to provide proof, nor feel that it is merely my 
opinion.  AIDS and HIV without all its excess baggage simply isn't that 
intricate.  If I told you I thought a 2 yr old could comprehend the 
intricacies of using a sippy cup, would you demand proof?
