This is not entirely true.

A standard user-based VPN will work fine on dynamic IPs, provided the end 
point is not configured strictly.

Most VPN tunnels, however, tunnel from one IP to another, and should have 
static IPs. 

I regret that my new ISP at home (I am a network admin at an ISP, but alas 
DSL does not reach my house and I am stuck with Comcast...) has *expensive* 
static IPs. I used to use ssh and vpn tunnels, etc, to access my home 
network from outside, but this sucks with a dynamic IP.
