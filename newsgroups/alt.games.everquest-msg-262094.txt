Hiya all,

since SOE now closed the thread of enchanters, trying to get done some
reasonable changes, on their boards and turned down all comments with a
one-star-rating, I just want to let everybody know there is a thread
available on therunes. Not only interesting if you play an enchanter
yourself... :

But as a small balance here another thread that I couldnt resist
laughing about even after reading the above mentioned one (/em still
holds his stomach):

I just love it =)

Have fun in game

Christian
