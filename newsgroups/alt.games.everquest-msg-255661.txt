    That might be a good feedback to the devs. If the LDoN merchants showed
everything they can sell, then people might be more motivated to do more
LDoN. I think the original idea was to reward those doing LDoN by being able
to "discover" the rewards first, but the rewards have long since been found
and it's time to change the system.
