Having had zero success in coming upon a Lammy in a "really good deal"
price range, I've had some time to stop and think things over. Even if I
do find a Lammy that I can afford (8K and under) it will wipe out my
bank account that I worked so long to build up and I'll only have one
item to show for it. Sure it's a great weapon, but is that what's *best*
to do with my hard earned plat?
  I mean, I need to keep reminding myself, "AC is KING" along with
needing good resists for special raids. Being within a yellow of 49, and
so approaching the ripe old level of 50, and taking a Norrathian look in
the mirror, most of my gear is pretty average to piss poor compared to
the twinks out there. Should I just be going on a massive shopping spree
to tune up elsewhere?
  In general, except when I switch in some special cold/heat resist
gear, (also piss poor) here's what I'm working with:
Mostly crafted armor (except)
Blood Stained Mantle
SSB for head slot
Belt is some sort of spun cloth belt (?) have to check that.
Frost Giant Beard
Two Jagged Bands
Couple other things I don't recall off hand, but nothing to crow about.

For weapons I'm primarily using a Kunjar and a BAL dual wield in group
situaitons where I'm MA.

Ok, so the faster I hit, the more taunt I generate for the hate list,
and yes, I guess the Lammy would not only increase my contribution to
damage generation, but increase tuant. But will it increase it *that*
much to justify wiping out all my funds? Or should I be looking to
replace stuff in some of the above slots with my cash to improve my AC,
other stats, and resists? Any suggestions?
