 Unless the cleric is level 60 with FT15 and KEI, I'd rather have my
cleric medding and not meleeing. If I was a healer, I'd get a cleric. If
I wanted another damage dealer, it more than likely wont be a cleric.
Although you mention a second cleric but there wasn't one in your
original group. So I'm a bit confused.

 I suppose it all comes down to the person making the group.
