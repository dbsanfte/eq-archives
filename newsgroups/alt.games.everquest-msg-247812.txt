I did forget to mention this was about a year ago that I was having these
problems in EK. Haven't played my druid for quite a while. The ones that I
could never get to, that were under the surface, were always up in the
mountain spine in EK. If they were down on the plains, or along the side of
the mountains, I never had problems with them.

In PoJ last night, we had a mob that was (on my screen only) halfway in the
floor. I couldn't cast on it, even when right next to it, because it was
'too far away'. I finally found a spot where I could cast on it and didn't
move, but I couldn't loot it (I'm usually the main looter when partnering
with my friend who RP's my brother), so I had to get my partner to loot.
