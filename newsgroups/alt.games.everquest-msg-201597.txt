Ranger tracking blows druid and bard tracking out of the water.  Being 
able to track almost all of a zone is _incredibly_ useful, while my druid 
can barely track a quarter.

Not very.  I was bow kiting hill giants in the karanas in my late 30s to 
raise archery, earn some minor cash and gain some XP.  Otherwise I've 
never really used it (bow kiting) much.

With Harmony (of Nature) and a long range bow/arrow, you become one of 
the best outdoor pullers.

Post-50 your archery becomes more useful, and post-55 you'll start using 
it on large raid targets where DPS is key.

Pretty easy.  I soloed my ranger up to 14, then grouped from about 15 to 
33, then soloed from 34 to 51 with gear I had mainly bought with my own 
money.  My ranger was my first character so she didn't get that much 
twinking.

I fear kited the snow cougars in Iceclad from 34-35, then ran around 
killing stuff in SolA til 39, then bow kited Hill Giants til 40, then 
went to jagged pine from 40 to 51, fear kiting the griffawns til about 47 
when the griffons started going down easier and were faster XP.

Quadding on my druid is a nice break when I want to see my xp bar move 
quickly without a lot of effort, but usually she's just a two-boxed heal 
bitch for when I'm farming stuff on my ranger that I'd have downtime with 
otherwise (like seafuries).
