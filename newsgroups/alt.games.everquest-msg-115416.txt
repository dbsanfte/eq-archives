Yes, I know.  I play a 58 enchanter, agnostic gnome.

It depends on how dubious you are.  If you're almost KOS, then it may take
you to not quite apprehensive.

The likeliest explanation is that you killed an ogre somewhere since the
last time you did that quest.  When I helped friends camp the AC in Ocean of
Tears, one of the mobs on the AC spawn table is an ogre.  Killing him 3
times was enough to knock me back to dubious from amiable.

I think the WK ogres hit Clurg faction, too.  They drop the batskull
earrings.

I'm sure there are lots of others.
