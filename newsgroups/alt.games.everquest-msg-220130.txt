}I was driving home the other day, and saw a dead dog on the side of the
}road...I had the sudden urge to stop and loot it's corpse...

I was driving a month or so ago, and pulled off the freeway to an offramp.  
The sky ahead of me was clear and blue.  As I went up the offframp, there 
was a fire burning on the other side of the hill just out of sight, So 
rather quickly my view changed from a clear blue to a more hazy orange.  
My first thought was, "Oh, acumen faded."
