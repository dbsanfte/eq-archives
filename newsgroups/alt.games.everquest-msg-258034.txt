I don't think it is bad, but I turned it off for my characters when I was
playing EQ...  

My main reason, my main is a Druid.  No reason for her to start swinging (You
are too far away from your target, you are too far away from your target, you
are too far away from your target...  AHHHH  LOL).

I didn't play melee classes at all excepting my Beastlord, so it was just
easier for me to map the attack button to 'Q' and hit it when needed...

I suppose I could have turned off that catchy Attack Music, and sent the attack
messages to an out of the way window, but it was easier to just shut off the
auto attack and hit Q if I needed it.  :)
