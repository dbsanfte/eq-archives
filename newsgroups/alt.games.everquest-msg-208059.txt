I think it would be hard to get into an uberguild as one of the
classes that don't stack well on raids (shaman/enchanter being the
obvious two). 

If high end raiding is all you really care about, cleric, ranger,
rogue or wizard would probably be the easiest classes to get into a
guild. It's often a moving target though, the usefulness of the
different classes changes over time. Cleric and the 3 DPS classes
above are probably safe bets though, healing and serious damage
dealers will never go out of style.
