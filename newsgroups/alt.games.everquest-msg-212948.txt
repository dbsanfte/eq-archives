What if the cleric is healing a charmed pet, not the bard?  I hear that
cleric/enchanter and cleric/druid make a good team for this reason.

Precisely...and while *being* the healer might be new for me....I wouldn't
mind if the entire experience were different.  

I'm already getting a kick out of the role reversal though...I was soloing
some critters during my 30 minute lunch break yesterday and kept making a
bit deal of "OMG Rak, I have down time!  I'm medding!"  (For those of you
not familiar with Rakyn, he would die before he was caught "just
sitting".  Because he is my role model for a healer, it is hard for me to
convince myself that it is Quite OK for a cleric to sit down and med if
they don't have a mount and there are not aggro issues.)

> Necro, druid, ranger, or shaman would make an interesting combo. 

Regrettably the only viable option for me of those four is necro.  Shaman
is out of bounds because that is my husband's turf, despite the fact that
that combo is AMAZING.  Ranger is out of bounds because it's silly to make
a new ranger when I already have a 65th level one *wink* (though I may
switch to foxeye when his bard hit's 55 or so).  Druid...well, that's a
tough one.  Frankly, I changed to ranger years ago to escape being a
druid.  Necro is worth considering, but then...you have that "robe" thing
again.  Better to do a mage in that case, because then I can atleast
fulfill RAk's endless demand for mage summoned weapons for his woof-woof.

Y'know what is actually the most fun about the cleric/bard combo...that it
is the ultimate "gimme gimme" for most guilds I meet.  While you
occssionally find a guild with a glut of clerics, I can't think of two
classes I see more guilds saying "recruitment closed except for bards and
clerics".
