Not so sure about letting the animation tank.Granted my Enc is only
45.When I let the pet tank in Dulak at zone in,it dies when the mob
still has 70% health,so as mentioned above I think its a much better
tactic to let the Enchanter tank himself.

When I upgrade my Enchanter I never look for Int,but hp gear.
At 45 I have 1500 hps unbuffed and 150 Int,did anyone ever notice
that I have "only" 150 Int ?  - No   :).
I never understood why people are proud to have 255 Int at low levels,
if you dont raid,it doesnt matter,and it wont make you regenerate mana
faster.  :)
