Vs... a minor upgrade dropping... and *nobody* saying anything for fear 
of burdening the LC... the item rots... and it was complete waste of 
time... what does that serve???

If the LC wants to 2-pass it... as in ... "Anybody really want it?" ... 
and if no takers, move to "anybody want to keep it from rotting" and 
just random it between them...or whatever...

Letting upgrade items rot is just silly, it doesn't serve any player, 
and it doesn't serve the guild either.

Like I said... exceedingly complex, and no better than LC. 1-3 points 
for some bosses... 5 points for others...  someone's going to walk away 
from that thinking its unfair. Monday raids I attend religiously but by 
coincidence for the last couple months,  they're always worth 1 point... 
but Thursday's when I play hockey seems to always be the 5 point raid... 
so some twit who raids 1 one Thu per month to my 4 per Mo. ends up ahead 
of me... yeah... real fair. Oh and who decides point values from week to 
week? Isn't that just another place for all the imperfections that 
plague LC to crop up?


Oh... and don't forget the LC deciding which items are 'specially' 
restricted this week...specially restricted until my alt/friend/nemesis 
gets one ... or needs one...

DKP has its advantages... but complex dkp systems invariably have gaping 
fairness holes in them. Simple dkp systems are just as bad... but at 
least they're simple... whats the point of a whole pile of 'rules' that 
really don't make the net system any fairer?

I favour... you show up and stay the duration... you get a point. You 
want something you bid points. Highest bidder gets the item. End of 
story.  Its not perfect to be sure... but at least its not 
corruptible... If some warrior wants to outspend a ranger for a bow that 
will primarily give him 10hps... then what of it... if the warrior *can* 
and *will* spend that much for an item the rangers will be bidding 
heavily on...who the hell cares? That's the system. If the warriors got 
that kind of dkp to blow let him blow it... he won't bid on the next 
one... and he earned it.

It sure beats 'behind the scenes' LC councils to rate weapons, rate 
encounters, rate 'special cases'...and override market values whenever 
someones desire for NBG are overly offended...all those behind the 
scenes LCs aren't making things better for the system in the long run.

Complex DKP systems have 5 times as much 'loot council' activity than an 
honest to god LC.
