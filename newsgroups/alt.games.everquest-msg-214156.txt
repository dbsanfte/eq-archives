Yeah, missed that.

Don't know off hand what affects the enchanter guild factions in Ak'Anon 
and Felwithe, so I am uncertain, but, allakhazam has a fair amount of 
faction info, you could lookup the factions that those guildmasters are 
on, and then find out what affects them, may give you a clue.  It's also 
possible that SoE messed something up, it has happened before.
