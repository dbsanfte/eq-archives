The LFG tag works amazingly well in this game so far.  People send
tells zones away to ask if you want to join in on something if they
can't find anybody in zone.  Generally, when I am looking to start a
group, I do an /ooc to start.  After that I start in on /who lfg
<fighter|scout|mage|priest (depending on what I need)> xx xx.  After
that, do the same command but with an 'all' after the 'who' and send
individual tells.  It works rather well, and even managed to get me a
group to kill Chomper at 3:45am this morning (waking up way to early
for work sucks).
