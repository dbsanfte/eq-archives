You just said it yourself.

I know hubby posted on why he was leaving EQ on that same forum as
well...and he has been contacted.  The thing is, he let his overall
unhappiness be known, but he did it in a level headed manner.  He himself
works in the video game industry and whether that carries any weight or not
I am unsure.  However, he was able to tell them exactly what was wrong,
specifially *why* it's wrong and his reasons for not coming back.
