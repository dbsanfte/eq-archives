Really? Huh, well when I payed month to month, I took a hiatus for a couple
of months. I cancelled my account, and the realized I would have had two
more weeks till that "month" was up. I tried to log in, and the account had
already been suspended.

So what you are saying is that after you pay for a three month slot, you
cancel, and the reinstate after those three months are used up??
