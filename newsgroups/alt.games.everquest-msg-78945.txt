Tough fight for 2 melee's
OK, this is just theory but here's how I'd try it (and possibly how you
already did)
Pally MUST have LoH up
You tank, pally does not taunt and melee's from behind or side (avoids
ripostes) If pally ever gets aggro he backs off so you can get it back, when
you are down to 2 bubs he LoH's (chances are by the time he gets it off
you'll be closer to 1 bub) and you go back at it, if the giant isn't close
to halfway dead by then it might be time to give up. Carry on as before,
you'll get a beating and this time when you are down to half, stop taunting
and let Pally take over aggro (hopefully on full health) hopefully, you'll
get him to turn before he kills the Pally.
Make sure you both have SoW incase it doesn't work out, you will not outrun
a giant without it.

Pally can prolly play more of a role but I am not familiar with their spells
at all.

As I said, if you have done this already then I have no idea, 2 melee's
(even one with small healing) is not an ideal group.
