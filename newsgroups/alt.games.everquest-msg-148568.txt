That was my first thought, high level bards have always seemed nigh
invulnerable (figured that explained the blue suit).  But with the
resist changes it might not be such a foregone conclusion.  Of
course, that's a double-edged sword, it might only mean that the
Bard actually has to put some real thought and effort into killing
you rather than just waiting around until you fall over.
