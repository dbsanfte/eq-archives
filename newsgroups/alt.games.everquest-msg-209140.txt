Alright dammit, you're the second poster this week saying melee damage
can break root.  I don't believe it.  Not for a second.  As a Paladin
I had two ways to stop a runner, root and stun, and stun was a pretty
piss-poor choice unless I knew somebody else was trying to snare.  Yes,
my roots broke, with the same frequency as when I stood back to heal
myself.  There is an exception:  DD procs have exactly the same shot at
breaking a root as any other DD.  As a Druid, I occasionally melee mobs
I've rooted trying to get Defense skill-ups.  When my weapon procs (a
75pt Lifetap which works as a DD+selfheal) it breaks root roughly half
the time (depends on level and MR of the mob, of course).  If my weapon
doesn't proc my roots break no more often than when I'm sitting and
watching the mob rot.

To recap:  _Melee_damage_does_not_break_root_!  (or, if it does, it
does it so rarely that only very extensive parsing is gonna reveal
it).  Weapon procs (and buff procs) that have DD components do break
root just as frequently as any other DD (and the size of the DD hit
appears to correlate somewhat with the likelyhood of a root break).

On the topic of bolt range vs. chase range:  I've noticed that a lot
of mobs seem to have shorter chase ranges since the last round of
pathing changes.  The Timber Griffons in JP, for example, have a chase
range only a little greater than the range of my DoTs.  My DoTs range
is 250.  I'd estimate chase range as between 300 and 350, what's the
range of a typical bolt?  and same with extended range?
