First of all, apologies if this is a RTFM question.

Is it possible to insert newlines in socials? Right now, if I want to
put a long auction in a social, it has to go something like:

/auction SELLING Bone Armplates/Leggings, Bad stats, but
/auction chainmail look for Casters. Please get them off
/auction me, I'm a bloody idiot for buying them in the
/auction first place!

Which results in four different auction messages. If there was something
like a \n newline, life would be easier. :)

On a related note, is it possible to edit a line in a social? Right now,
when I click on the line, it poofs, and I have to type it again.

And since we are in the subject of the interface, it would be really
nice if we could read the eqnotes.txt file from within EQ, rather than
just write to it. :/
