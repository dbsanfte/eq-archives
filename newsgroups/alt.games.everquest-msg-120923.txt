For xp groups you don't need CHeal at all.  I often am the only healer in a
group, even at level 54 with nothing buy my Superior Heal.  I slow mobs,
haste melee, and heal them.  Generally speaking we can fight with zero
downtime.  It's all about choosing the proper location.  For many raids, you
absolutely must have at least one cleric, no question there.  There are many
raids where you do not need the holy trinity of eq characters, but they sure
do make it easier.
