My shaman went run 3 then regen 3.. now the regen points have been refunded
im not sure what to go for.

3 more regen/tick hardly makes a difference.. I don't even bother with regen
when im canni'ing (i have a insta cast regen too)

I guess regen is the less useless of them all though

Concerning returned AA's.. and this has pissed off some of my friends -
They only refunded general regen (costs 1point per level)
The regen in arch hasn't been refunded (2points,4points etc per level)

I can't understand why they feel the need to only refund 1, when both were
nerfed
