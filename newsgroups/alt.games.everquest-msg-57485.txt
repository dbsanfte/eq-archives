Just to elaborate a little... an enchanter can Mesmerize the mobs not
currently being attacked.  This will keep them quiet until they are attacked.
This is why it's *so* important only to assist the tank (if you're not it) and
attack one mob at a time.  Otherwise, you'll be fighting several mobs at once, 
taking much more damage than necessary.  Many groups have died because members
of the group broke this rule, either because they were bored with the
one-at-a-time technique, negligent, or just plain not aware of more effective
tactics.

A good enchanter acts usually acts as a buffing machine pre-fight, and
a traffic cop during the fight.  They also have a variety of DoT and DD
spells at their disposal.

After the fight, they can go in disguise, enchant ores and metals,... and melee
like my deceased grandmother :P
