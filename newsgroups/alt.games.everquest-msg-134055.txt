OK, good, now we've removed all the (deliberately by some?) distracting
side issues and got down to the real crux of the matter. THAT is a
position I can understand and accept, even if I don't 100% agree with
you. I don't think the "intrinsically complex medical/social issue" is
that far removed from the subject of handicapped/wheelchairbound people,
when taken from a tolerance/acceptance standpoint alone, especially
given SS's past history. I can understand however that it's a 'grey
area' given the generalised social stigma attached to the disease, and
that people will have equally valid and/or heartfelt arguments for
either side of the debate.

>That is my position on the matter and no amount of name calling or

On the contrary, I've no intent to force you to subscribe to my view on
'life, the universe and everything'. In fact I respect the fact that
you're one of the few people here to cut through the chaff, and get down
to the actual nitty-gritty substance of the debate.

If there weren't different views, there wouldn't be a debate.

(note: though I'm agreeing to disagree, that doesn't mean the thread is
ended, because according to the 'Rules of Usenet' <1989 revision> any
thread over 100 posts HAS to have at least 1 RL threat, and at least one
accusation of being a Nazi/Hitler - that hasn't happened, therefore the
thread cannot end)
