I have had this happen to me once before, although I actually did fall into
a little hole at the time, which should've cost me 100-200 points of damage
(fallen into it a bunch of times before) but then once it whammed me for
10000.

Talked to a GM about it, and found out this is what happens when lag happens
in the middle of a fall- you start falling, or perhaps start in a downward
direction down a hill, lag happens, and the computer thinks you've been
going in a downward direction much longer than you actually have, upping the
damage.  10000 points is the maxiumum amount that can happen at a time.

Although this has never happened to me personally, apparently this can also
happen when you fall through the world geometry.
This might explain why you end up in weird places, or you may also be ending
up at loc 0,0.
You could also be ending up far away because the computer thinks you're
still running when you have a lag spike, and perhaps
it also think you ran off that ledge over in the distance, when in fact you
haven't.

Next time, I would take a screenshot and a report of the 10000 damage thing.
The GM I spoke to when it happened to me was willing to res me (if I hadnt
looted me corpse just 5 minutes earlier, dooh!)
