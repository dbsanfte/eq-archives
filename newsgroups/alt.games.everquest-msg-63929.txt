Like many fed up EQ players did, I ran out and bought DAoC on day 1. 
Started my Midgard Shadowblade (rogue).  Graphics kicked the kazoo
outta EQ, lots of cool feats that EQ should have done like the LFG
box, no CR, etc... I was sold!  Double clicked my EQ icon and hurried
to my cancel button, /bye EQ.  About 3 days later, I realize how
miserable my rogue is... half the stuff that sold me on the rogue
ideas was not implemented nor was there an ETA... the cool stuff like
scaling walls, etc... Hiding & backstabbing was just a pain & the ass,
and dmg wasnt that much to brag about.  Ok, so I just found a broken
class.  Started a spiritmaster (necro equiv) this gets nerfed to all
hell and is even more useless than my rogue.  Start an eldritch
(wizard) on a diff server, KICK ASS!! I'm nuking blues to death before
they reach me.  Next week, nerfed again. Eldritch no longer fun to
play.  Back to midgard where my rl friend plays.  I hear archers kick
ass in pvp, so i dump a week into one of those... well, apparently
they kicked too much ass in pvp, a bunch of cloth wearing casters
standing in the middle of the battlefields bitched and moaned when
they got sniped with an arrow and killed in 1 or 2 shots, so my hunter
got nerfed to all hell, not once, not twice, but 3 times in 2 weeks. 
I know eq nerfed like this in the beginning with necros and such, but
its not that way anymore thank god.

Besides nerfing, daoc for me means running around trying to find a
good place to kill without being mobbed by crap 5 levels higher than
you.  And the sprint to get away feature is near useless.

/bye DAoC, /hug EQ.  

DAoC has potential, but I'm willing to dump 1000 hours into a class
that will be near useless in the end.  I'll stick with the more mature
game and troll the vault boards to watch the state of DAoC for another
year or so...

Anyone else back from daoc?

Yeah i know this letter is just a bunch of bitching and moaning, but
maybe it will save the next frustrated eq'er from wasting money on
false hopes =)
