Her choice, and I completely respect that. But if MY mother wants to
pack (she doesn't, but that's neither here nor there), she has the
riight.

Can't say anything about your mom. Don't know her. But some of the
most deadly shots in the world are women. Shooting is one sport where
women & men compete directly, and more often than you'd think, it's a
woman who wins those competitions.

Me too, but if Mom (Or sis, or Girlfriend, or wife, or whoever) is in
danger, I want her to be able to get out of danger. That's my prime
concern. And a 100lb woman just isn't up to the task of taking out a
200+lb man in a hand to hand confrontation. (Nto counting the rare
exception of the black belt, who still is at a disadvantage due to
size/weight ratios)
