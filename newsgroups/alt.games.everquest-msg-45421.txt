I was shocked, shocked, to find that I wasn't KOS, but I really wasn't.
Oh, and I did do Noclin's Femur, but none of the other quests in there.
On the other hand, I also didn't hunt in Warrens at all before going,
under the mistaken impression that its a 10 to 20 zone.  Warrens hunting
should fix any faction trouble you manage to make for yourself.

Being KOS to the occaisional mob like the Emmisary isn't a good indicator,
try approaching the Erud entrance and connning the guards there.  They
are on the same faction as the guards roaming inside, and that faction (whichever
it is) is just about the only thing between you and the boat.  Bard faction,
but you've no chance of screwing that up in Paineel/Tox/Warrens/Stonebrunt
that I can think of, and as it happens Erudite Necro of Cazic Thule is jake
with them... he will even give you the letter quest!
