No, I shoot it down because this action, while sacrificing maybe 100
innocents, would have saved even more lives *directly*. Because it
would have been an extremely time-limited situation and the only
effective response.

However, it has already happened. Bombing the responsible country
"into oblivion" will be too large a sacrifice for too little effect
too late.

Do not walk behind me, for I may not lead. Do not walk ahead of me, for I 
may not follow. Do not walk beside me, either. Leave me the hell alone.
