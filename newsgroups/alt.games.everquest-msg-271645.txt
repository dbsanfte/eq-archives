It's Scholar Refining Level 11 I believe (name is something close to that 
anyway).  Not sure off hand where it may drop, I picked up a copy last 
night for 80 Silver.  The next problem you will run into is that you will 
need either Silver or Coral to make the ink (actually to make a 
subcomponent of the dye used to make the ink).  These are the rare 
(extremely rare) harvested materials.
