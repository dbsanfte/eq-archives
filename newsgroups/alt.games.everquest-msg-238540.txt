What I'd be the most afraid of, after they do this, is that Eqwindows
would not work anymore until they guy fixed it. This would be bad for
me duoing on the same computer since eqwindows manages memory a
billion times better than regular everquest. 

Regular everquest actually CONSERVES real system ram use, when the
second instance goes up, using more and more of the virtual swap. As
anyone knows, its preferrable to use real ram when you can since it is
always faster. So it was odd to see two windowed everquests using only
about 250 meg of 768 meg of ram, while the virtual swap use was at
like 450. Meanwhile, two eqwindows windows used closer to the full 768
meg of system ram at some points while my virtual swap use only ever
got as high as about 80 meg.

The problem is the EQwindows guy seems to be kind of MIA, not updating
the thing since April I think. Of course that was the last time he HAD
to update it, so maybe he still would if it was broke again.
