Hi All

How's THIS for a novel way of dealing with a griefer in a MMORPG!
Wonder if they'd ever do something as drastic as this in EW, WoW, etc.
How about a stockade in PoK, where various offenders get exhibited for
a week, with their "crime" on a placard around their neck...  Nah -
crucify the buggers!!  :)

[cue cries of "Welease Bwian!"  "Welease Bawabbus!"...]

The webmasters of online game "Roma Victor" nailed a player to a cross
in cyberspace for illegally killing new players before they got to
grips with the game.

The player, known by the online name of 'Cynewulf', spent seven days
on full public display in a square in the Roman town of Corstopitum �
modern-day Corbridge in Northumberland � where fellow gamers were able
to verbally insult and throw rotten fruit at him.

It seems the ancient punishment worked better than an Asbo.

Cynewulf was taken off the cross last week and is now behaving
himself, said the game's creator RedBedlam.
