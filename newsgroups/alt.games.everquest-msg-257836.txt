Ooops, forgot to finish my thought.

What if I'd been rezed in the middle of a spawn site, then heard this 
warning and moved off to a safe spot to camp?

When I died we were just breaking in to the P&E section of POJ, if it 
had happened five minutes later I'd have been rezed in the hall, since 
basically all you do is move up and down the hall fighting in spots you 
just cleared; you never get more than two mobs this way, but there's no 
spot in the whole run that's "safe" of aggro range on repop, except one 
corner.  So I'd have run over to that corner... and on server repop, I'd 
have appeared back out in the middle of the hall, two mobs would have 
instantly aggroed on my unbuffed, rez effects self; welcome to death 
number two.
