This mornings project was experimenting with a martial artist.

Frankly, I wasn't impressed, although I see a lot of people swear by 
them.  Maybe they improve as they level up.

Here's the deal; you start out with a nano which lets you raise anyone's 
martial arts skill, your own included.  And you get a special item, a 
yin yang symbol which you put in inventory and hotkey as a clicky.  This 
item, Jabbing Fist or something, is a special martial arts attack you 
can only use while not carrying weapons, it does about 3 damage.  Damage 
output via martial arts skill isn't bad, but its nothing to write home 
about either, comperable to that of the various weapons other classes 
tend to use, perhaps a bit lower.

Trouble is, the other classes can do quests to upgrade their weapons on 
the island, while the MA cannot.  Upgraded, the other classes do 
substantially better damage.  Further, they can in most cases arrange to 
dual weild, which raises damage output by another 30% or so.  Martial 
arts attacks don't dual weild, which is odd considering you clearly have 
two empty hands, how this differs from carrying two knives I don't know.

The suggestion I was given was to use the bow; that helped a bit, and it 
made a bit of sense; its the shaolin bow, after all.  And the bow skills 
are among the green (easy to raise) ones for the profession.  But you 
don't get one issued at start, you have to buy it off the vendor.  And 
when you do equip it, you still can't dual weild with it as best as I 
can figure.  Worse, with it in hand you can no longer use brawl or your 
special martial arts skill.  Now the truth is, upgraded, your bow damage 
output is much better than your martial arts melee output, even 
considering losing the specials.

The bow's special ability is "aimed shot", which lets you do extra 
damage but only to a mob that doesn't know you are there, a bit 
difficult to arrange on the island.  I guess getting some sneak ability 
trained up would let you do a good first strike on missions et al where 
you have some moving around out of sight.  But in the meantime, this 
means the bow does damage like a single weapon for other classes, 
without the fling shot/burst/etc bonusses.

I didn't join a faction with this character, and took him to Borealis, 
which is yet another different starting area, this one for the nuetrals. 
  Its interesting, but I just don't see nuetral as balanced considering 
the advantages that joining a faction gives you if you work at it a bit. 
  Perhaps that all evens out at higher levels, my current preoccupation 
with the 1 to 10 game isn't really a fair comparison.  In the low end 
game, he's the least impressive character I've run so far, two strikes 
against him, my martial arts complaint and the fact that factionless, I 
didn't get all the cool newcommer armor.
