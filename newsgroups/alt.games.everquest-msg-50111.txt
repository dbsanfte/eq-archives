There are some mobs out in Steamfont that ups your Gemchoppers faction
(Minos are one I believe, I think some of the rogue/runaway clockworks
give a useful ak'anon faction). SO long as your faction isnt totally shot
then there is a guy in a room alone in full Watchman armour that you can
hand in blackboxes to for faction...and the scrap metal quest may give
good faction as well.....

If you go to Allakhazam.com and look through the quests involving Akanon
then you should find some useable ones that run off steamfont loot.
