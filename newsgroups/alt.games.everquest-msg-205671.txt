Actually, progressive money will work if, and only if, you have a 
unlimited bankroll. Working at the Peppermill Hotel and Casino in Reno, 
Nevada as long as I did I saw many "amateurs" try progress betting only 
to end up broke, however, many "high rollers" who have ungodly bankrolls 
seldom go belly-up. Another thing that effects this is the fact that the 
whales seldom have house limits imposed on them, which is good for 
progressive betters of course.
