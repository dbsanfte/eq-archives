People like me who know a lot more than people like you dont like the things
that you use :)

Ok, but seriously a lot of people in the industry (I am a software engineer
in Australia) use UNIX or  Linux because Microsofts software is c - grade at
best. The engineering of the software is so shabby that it offends a lot of
people's sensibilities ie. i could have done it better :). Also, for
development i need a stable platform with no bugs, and lot of freeware handy
programming tools, and MS just doesn't do it for me.

So i have 2 setups at home, well actually like 8 or so, 2 of them run linux
for work, and the rest run windows 2000 for general surfing / everquesting.

Then of course, there are the people who just bag MS and AOL because they
have no idea what they are talking about and jumped on the proverbial
bandwagon.

AOL is ridiculed by a lot of people because:

1. They Suck
2. They are tailored towards people with no clue (their slogan is "the net
made easy")
3. Historically they have bad service
4. They use a wierd browser.
5. They own everything.
6. I dont like the initials.
7. They suck.
8. I have cable anyway.
9. I lost my 56k modem.
10. They suck.

The one thing i will give MS over UNIX is that i fucking hate netscape and
LINUX makes you use that, then of course there is LYNX, which is quite handy
for surfing the web through a telnet / SSH session

Well there you have it, thats why people dont like MS or AOL :)
