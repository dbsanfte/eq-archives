You made an assertion as to what they should have done from a moral and 
ethical standpoint. That assertion is incorrect if the act was neither 
immoral nor unethical. I merely pointed out that you've established 
neither immorality nor a lack of ethics on their part. All you've given 
is a personal preference in the matter.

If the amount they have charged to your account to date never exceeds 
what you should have paid to date, then they've done you no harm nor 
treated you badly or disrespectfully in any way, whether it be by 15x$1 
charges, a $10 and a $5 or a single $15 charge.

Unless you can present even a hypothetical scenario where you would be 
in a position of owing your keyboard money, that is just another in a 
long list of inappropriate analogies.

There is something wrong in my book with disputing a charge you knew was 
valid. If you were aware of the rate hike, then the charge *is* valid. 
That much really cannot be legitimately debated.

So you would insist that they credit your account only to send you a 
bill which you promise to promptly pay? I'm sorry, but that is just pure 
obstinance, especially when we're talking about a one-time charge of $2. 
Why insist upon a $2 transaction costing anyone more than it has to?

I hope you never complain about rising costs, legitimate or otherwise, 
when you, yourself, are so quick to contribute to it unnecessarily.
