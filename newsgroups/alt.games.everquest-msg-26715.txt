Clerics get a bonus (around 10-15%) on all healing spells, so your
Greater Healing beats theirs.

It's the level.  At 39, you get Complete Heal.  At that point, no one
else comes anywhere near you for keeping a tank alive without causing
a lot of downtime for medding.

There will still be situations in the high 40's where the Shaman is a
better choice than a Cleric for group healer, but that will be because
the Shaman can slow the mob enough to reduce the damage the group
takes enough that the Shaman's healing is good enough.

At current high end encounters, Warrior and Cleric are the core
classes, with Rogue and Monk highly desired, Ranger and Wizard
welcome, and everyone else only gets in because they are friends of
the raid leaders.  When your tanks all have 4-5k hitpoints, and the
mobs are quad hitting for large amounts, and the mobs have insanely
high magic resistence (so only Wizards with lure spells can land
anything), that Shaman's job is to buff everyone before the fight
starts, then get out of the zone to reduce lag.

NOTE: this could all change with the next expansion.  Pre-Kunark, in
an optimal high level group, there was no need for a Cleric.  Kunark
made Clerics useful again.  Velious made them essential.  With Luclin,
they will surely be doing more class tuning.
