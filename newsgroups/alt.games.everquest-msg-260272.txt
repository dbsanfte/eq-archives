I don't buy it.. i've seen people work their butts off at 65 to try to
get something as simple as trials flag because they didn't bother
doing it. And when they find out they can't get decent groups for
there and their guilds are busy raiding 'cool' stuff.. they realize
why you get it when you can. If he got the flag, then good for him.
Its never a waste when its one step closer to the elemental planes,
and an AA + charm upgrade at that.

Btw.. Lance.. the High Guardians of Justice are CoD'able if you have a
65 chanter with good AA, and you can take them in trial with you :>.
Not sure if you do or not.. but when you do just setup a charm core.
