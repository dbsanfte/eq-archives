Well, yes, if you're a twinkee ranger I suppose you wouldn't. Wurmslayer
is ASTONISHINGLY cheap for the stats. I was using one at 52, I think, quite
happily, and only swapped it out when I got a lupine. 

Of course, if you can afford to go twink yourself up the wazoo with a skyfury
scimitar or frostbringer or some other droppable toy, then I suppose you
won't use wurmy ;)
