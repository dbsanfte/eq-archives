Gee, to answer the question, *no* I didn't no about the faction hit I'd
receive, if I'd have known I wouldn't have gone. I seem to be being flamed
here, I'm not sure why, I only asked if there was a way to rectify my
faction. I was KoS in Surefall Glade but thankfully slaughtering everything
on sight in Black Burrow (time after time) has now made me apprehensive in
the Surefall Glade zone. I've conned just about every Druid in all the zones
I've seen since, and I'm not KoS to any of them.

I haven't chanced running into Felwithe as far as the bank, I'm allied to
the guards thanks to my Crushbone sessions, but when I open the door to the
Paladin guild, well, he's a mad as he can get ..

I came here for help, not to be flamed for ignorance ..

As always, regards to you all, and safe hunting ..

Stevie.
