So your opinion in this case is that he should give up trying to get a
separating character in his name and go sit in IRC groups because, what?
That's more his mentality?

Your comment of "Only if one is bothered by the temperature" reads like you
don't actually care if one of your own "snipes" is justified or not.

What do I expect from people here? Some courtesy would be a start. As for
your opinions, sure it's good to stand by them but it's better to be able to
view others and re-evaluate your own, not just fight for it because it's
yours...
