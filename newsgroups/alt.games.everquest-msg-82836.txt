I've never had any trouble finding the components.  The hardest to find are
the chitterling barbs and acrylia bits.  

Chitterlings are not that common a spawn, there are only 3 or 4 of them up
at any one time, but if you know exactly where to look, they're easy to
find.

Acrylia is a bit harder, because you're competing with smiths and tailors.

I charged 2K for tailoring and jewelry, 1K for smithing and fletching, 500pp
for baking, brewing, and pottery.  I say "charged", because I think the
window on those prices has closed.  More tinkers are getting their skill up,
and prices are dropping rapidly.

I charge 500pp per successful combine.
