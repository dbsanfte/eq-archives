"the percentage is outrageous!"

Hahahah that's rich. $3.00 a month is nothing. It averages out to
about  $0.10 a day.

Just stop by your local mall and fish 7 dimes out of the fountain once

allowance.

PS Life isn't fair, and there is no tooth fairy. Sorry to burst your
bubble before all baby teeth had fallen out.
