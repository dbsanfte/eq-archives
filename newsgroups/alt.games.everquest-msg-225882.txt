Did an LDON last night in BB. Had a 49 pally with us, rest of us were 53-55.
Got NO xp at for the 1st 10 kills even though we got the yellow XP message.
Switched to TOTAL 100% AA points and got about 10% for the rest of the
mission.  Petitioned it and guide escalated it to a GM before the server
came down on us without any ingame warning.

Needless to say, we weren't happy with not completing the mission.  Wonder
if it will count as a failure..... haven't logged on again yet to check.
