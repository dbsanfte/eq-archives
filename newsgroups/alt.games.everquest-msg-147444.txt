Really?  I thought monks could attack magic-only mobs with Magic
gloves (I often hear about monks trying to get Magic netted gloves
from the Frogloks in Innothule Swamp or Qeynos sewers).  I know that
all monks' special attacks from level 5 on (Round Kick, Eagle Strike,
etc.) are considered "Magic" attacks, and that once a monk reaches
level 30 he or she can attack magic-only mobs with their bare hands
(without requiring Magic gloves).
