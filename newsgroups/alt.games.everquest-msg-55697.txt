Scene: Monday, I turn over the Discord book as my level 51 warrior "MrAnon"
(Note: not my real char name.) as this seemed like a better choice then
cancelling my account.

Thursday: I figure out that being Discord really, really sucks. I petition to
get an "Order quest" to undo the PvP status, I figure it'll at least give me
something to do in the meanwhile.

GM Rhosle replies: "You'll need to contact GM Rohadrim , he gives the quests,
his hours are Wednesdays - Sundays 3 PM 11 PM PST"

I later realize how incoherent that reply was. Wednesdays AND Sundays, or
Wednesdays THROUGH SUNDAYS? 3 PM THROUGH 11 PM or what ?

So I wait until Sunday. Re-petition requesting GM Rohadrim at 3:00 PM.

GM Thinra replies: "I'm sorry, Rohadrim does not give the Order quest, you'll
need to find the Priestess of Order, she's only online 4pm and 12pm, PST,
wednesdays through sundays, she should be online in the next hour."

So I wait until 4:00, I petition requesting the Priestess of Order, I wait TWO
hours, until I get...

GM Starzin replies: "The priestess of order is unavailable right now, I think
she's sick, you'll have to re-petition Wednesday between 3 - 10 PM PST"

Tune in next Wednesday for the follow up to this amazing merry-go-round
adventure !!!
