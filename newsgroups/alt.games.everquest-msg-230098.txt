Graeme,

I don't know what  your shoulders are, but if they don't equal or exceed

COG ENCRUSTED EPAULETS
MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP
Slot: SHOULDERS
AC: 12
DEX: +8 STA: +10 WIS: +12 AGI: +8 HP: +65 MANA: +65
SV COLD: +10 SV POISON: +10
Recommended level of 55.
Focus: Haste of Mithaniel
WT: 0.8 Size: MEDIUM
Class: CLR DRU SHM
Race: ALL
Slot 1, Type 7

then you might want to consider taking a good group to the factory in
Innovation.  These drop pretty commonly from the Protos.  The focus effect
is a spell haste for healing spells.  One trip was sufficient to outfit two
shamans and a cleric with these; they were very appreciative.
