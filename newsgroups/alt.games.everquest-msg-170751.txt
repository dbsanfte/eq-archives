I was having these problems right after I upgraded my system from P3 w/
intel chipset on mobo to an AMD w/VIA chipset mobo.  The only game/program
having problems was EQ.  I kept getting dumped to desktop, sometimes entire
system would reboot.  Sony's tech support was no help (i.e. reinstall game,
reinstall video, disable soundcard, update VIA drivers, reformat entire
system, blah-blah) and I realized they were just running me in circles doing
everything I already tried.  No I don't blame Sony as this is general tech
support despite product vendor.
To make a potentially long story short, I discovered through a very long,
painstaking process of trial and error that the VIA chipset drivers were
garbage and I'm never going buying a mobo that includes these hunks of crap
again.  They would bring the whole game crashing down, and on a couple
reformats they hosed everything when installed.  What I finally did to get
them to work is only install the drivers that were digitally-signed by
Micro$oft.  The rest used by the system were the ones that were included
with Win2k out of the box.  This is the only instance I've ever seen where
M$'s stamp of approval actually amounted to more than just an annoying
window to close during installation, but I've played 2 months without a
single crash to the "Plane of Desktop" as opposed to the 5 to 10 minutes
span of play I had been experiencing.

Good luck,
Sean...
