As a Halfling Druid my home town was Rivervale. I have done both Runneye and
HHK - HHK is way better.  As someone pointed out you can bind there - but I
did not bind at the bank, I bound just outside in the "courtyard" - not far
to the action but it does save you from logging into a bad situation.  GREAT
xp - I was in HHK from about 20 to 35 and then moved to Rathe Mountains to
kill Hill Giants.

Excuse my ignorance but what is a firepot?  Do I not know of them because I
am a Druid or is it another Firiona Via server differance?
