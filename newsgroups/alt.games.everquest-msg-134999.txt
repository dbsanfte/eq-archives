After 3.5 years, 30 is probably considered "low" to most people (the ones
who have forgotten what it's like to be level 1 for the very first time, and
how SUCKY the 20s are).

Mid-range is mid-40s to low 50s.  Upper level would be 55+, and high level
being 59+. :p

No, I don't agree with these descriptions but many a.g.e regulars would.
They don't realize how elitist that sounds.
