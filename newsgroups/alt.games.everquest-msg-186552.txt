Oh fine fine.  So I plan on using Nova to kite her into the ground over, 
and over, and over, and over, and... :D

Still.  She only killed one of my characters, too - but many times.  My 
poor little human SK on TMarr was forever being smacked around by her 
cause I'd sit to heal or mem a spell or something, some stupid wolf 
would jump me, and she'd be there, waiting gleefully on the sidelines, 
to smack me around.
