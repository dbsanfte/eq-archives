How are they supposed to be considered "rare" when there is a
universal quest for them now?   

It's like playing the Monopoly Peel and Win game at McDonalds.  You
collect all the game pieces and are still missing one for each color
because only one or two were put out nationwide.  

I'd rather have to wait and kill a damn spawn for the JBoots than have
to wait and kill a spawn for a component to get them.  

Verant is toying round with their players.  Plain and simple.
