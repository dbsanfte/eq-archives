Hi,

the brains are dropped in EC and WC off Giant Fire Bettles ( also needed for
bard-armor-quest ).

The Hide is dropped off a rabid grizzly in Karana ( very rare drop, took me
about 40 to kill ).

For the eye, I am looking for it now for 2 weeks, no success. People told me
that they maybe drop off the named rat ( Scruffy ), but I ï¿½m not sure about
that ( it never had this ones on when I killed it ).

Hope I could help

Christian
