Not stupid at all, why?

Being a kid absolves him of having to be the perfect player.
Being a kid means that he needed to be taught something about how to play
properly.
Just letting him die with no explanation does not do that.

Well, I don't know what your kids are like but...

You think he linked the two events?
Why do you think that?

Well, since the game has changed a huge amount in the last one year, I think
your experience of the lower end of the game may be irrelevant now.

That is exactly what a gung-ho player would do.

"People like that" (Bizbee) = "People who are shit at pulling and don't
listen to others in the group?" (Me)
How do you figure that someone who does that would wait until the other
person died and then take out the wounded mob?
What is the link in your mind?
