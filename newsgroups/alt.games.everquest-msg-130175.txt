Not a zone, but a suggestion:
A month or so ago pets got a lot of changes, including that they >can't
break mez anymore<.
This is significant in that you can have a pet up while in a group and still
mezzing things. Just get hit once so your pet engages then step back and
wait for the mob to die :).

Also, don't hesitate to grab a mage (and duo if you want), those pets can do
serious damage and it's almost risk free nowadays.
