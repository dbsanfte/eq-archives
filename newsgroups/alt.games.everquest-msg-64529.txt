  Please do not bog down their tech support guys with your complaints, it
will only make matters worse.  If you have a complaint, criticism, or
whatever... go through the proper channels.  Instead of emailing the address
you provided, try eqfeedback@soe.sony.com instead.  Or if you just want to
vent/discuss what you think is wrong, post here or in some other EQ related
forum, but don't except a warm and mature reception, especially if you
mention that you're paying for the game and especially if the character of
your own post lacks maturity.

  Have fun and good luck.
