Yeah, that ore was used in the "Remeber Garzicor" DN quest.  Hugely annoying
and if you failed on any of the forging combines you had to go whack a
Cliff Golem again, and a Suit or 3 past whatsisname in Kael to try again.
Then had to go play with the silly bug traps in DN, spawn a ghost dragon
kill that, then do another turn-in in Skyshrine.
