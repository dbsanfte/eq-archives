Based on my experience, rogues are the worst soloists. Clerics can
solo undead effectively all the way to 60 if they are so inclined. At
51, there was nothing even light blue that I could solo with any
degree of effectiveness. At 60, I can still lose 3 bubbles while
taking down a sand giant and, until I got Run 3, I had almost no means
of suriving a random, zone-crossing encounter.

I was able to solo effectively to 40, but that was with the help of a
fungal regrowth tunic. Once I traded it for a load of other gear, my
soloability was non-existent.
