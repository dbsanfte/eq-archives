They have a couple of necro/SK quests I believe. One for the Coterie Mask 
of The Dead for example (clicky FD mask, which is nice since you have a 
virtually no fail FD then - cast FD, if it fails click your mask, if the 
mask fails the cast time on your spell should have recycled by then).

Aren't they allied with Seru too? Katta is all the goody-goody happy, 
smiling Paladins, whereas Sanctus Seru is a police state full of religious 
zealots and interrogators. Which do you think *you* should fix faction 
with?
