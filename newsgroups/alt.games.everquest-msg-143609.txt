I believe there's one with like, two charges, from the depths of Chardok 
somewhere.  However many charges it is, it didn't sound like enough for me 
to get as far as learning how to even use the darn spell in a manner 
effective for its intended purpose, ie, providing lighthearted comic 
relief. :)

But yeah, I know, if they give chanters Voice Graft, no one will want to 
group with necros anymore...
