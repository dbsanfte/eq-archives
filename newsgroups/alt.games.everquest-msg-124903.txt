Most good guilds will respect a first in force . Pnp never gets called into
play for uber mobs that have already spawned though. From spawn till death
is usually not a very long time once someone notices , it is certainly a
smaller amount of time then the response time from customer no service.

Pnp gets invoked when more than one group is waiting on spawn to happen.
This is what I hate and refuse to participate in. Nothing I like less than
waiting around hours for a spawn that might , maybe spawn middle of next
tuesday. This is however what guildmembers always seem to want. The
incessant whining tends to get on my nerves :p

I have helped kill ragefire more than 40 times. Mainly this is because I
play late at night . Most of these where pre skyfire ragefire but I have
done several of him too :) Of those times we have been ksed once, attempted
ksed about 2 more times, and the other 35 where just uncontested. Loose lips
sink ships.
