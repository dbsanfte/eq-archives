This was a joke, right?

Thereby dumping the need to ever get your epic...who'd want a crappy level
56 rez after that?

> Invisibility versus Undead: Fixed duration self only Invis Vs. Undead.
Already get it as a spell at level 50.  Waste of time to make it a skill as
it's only put up for about 30 seconds every few weeks most of the time.

> Cleansing Light: Single target complete poison and disease cure.
Why bother?  Neither is implimented in the game very well.  Handy in Oasis
but I'm sure the cleric will probably be 50+ before he gets this.

> Enchanter
> Dominating Gaze: Fixed duration charm.
Eh.  Rather overpowering I think (my main is 55 enc)

> Gather Mana: Self only complete mana refill.
> Mana Regeneration: Self only mana regeneration +2 per tick
Why bother?  I'm sure this'll be post 50 and at 51 we have 2 spells that
steal mana.  Even if we didn't, enchanters can start most battles with just
20% mana with no problem.

> Focused Mind: Possibly targettable mana bonus
We've got spells that do this very well...why bother?

> Druid
> Servant of Nature: Fixed duration animal charm.
> Strong Root: Lure based root.

Don't know what Lure is...never got my necro that high.  At level 52 my
druid's root works very well and usually lasts max time as it is.  Why
bother?

Unresistable huge "Wizard Gets Killed Immediately" skill.

> Shaman

> mana.

And the cleric gets a heart attack every time it's cast.

> Rabid Bear: Self only bear form with +200 ATK

Yeah, all those shaman who had to beg, borrow & steal to get the bear form
at 55 or 56 will be thrilled that it'll be so easy on everyone else.
