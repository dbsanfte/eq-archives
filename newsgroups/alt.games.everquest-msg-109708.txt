Um, no.  The concept of "evil" being purely relative is neither
supported nor denied by those words.  Returning my words to their
original context:

Lokari:
For example, consider the Al Qaeda. By conventional US standards,
their actions are wrong, evil, and even insane. However, by Al Qaeda
standards, they are righteous, good and sane.

John M Clancy:
Regardless of what 'they' call their actions it does not change the fact
that the actions are evil by definition.

Lokari:
No, they are evil by *your* definition. By their definition, the
person who slams a plane into a building, killing hundreds, is
guaranteed passage to heaven. And you, as an American (I'm assuming),
are evil to them.

Kaev:
Their assertion that it is so does not make it true.  Their use of
the words does not of itself redefine my (or your) meaning for them.
...

My words are in no way inconsistent with the belief that there is
an understandable and universal root to the twin concepts of good
and evil.  The first sentence points out that the definition given
by Lokari gains no intrinsic truth value from simply from having
been stated.  The second sentence asserts that simply using a word
differently from somebody else does not change the meaning of the
other party's statements.

You take my first two sentences out of context and claim they support
the contention that there is no meaining to "evil" out of context.
Fascinating.  Are you a lawyer?
