    I'm looking at the naming policy at
http://eqlive.station.sony.com/lowsrc/support/customer_service/cs_naming_pol
icy.jsp and I'm just not seeing where you're getting that Zappa is a
violation. Number 5, real life name? It would be a real stretch for a GM to
zap the name based off that, unless there was a last name that made the
reference obvious. That's like saying Emmett should be nuked because he's
CLEARLY named after the NFL running back, ex of the Cowboys.
