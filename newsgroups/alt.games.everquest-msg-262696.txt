These days, most voters are, in fact, mindless cattle, and usually
cast their votes based on just one or two issues, and don't pay any
attention to other issues, which are often much more important.

The abortion issue is a good example.  Probably no less than 50% of
the votes George W. Bush receives is from Christians who are one issue
voters.  These same Christians will ignore all the other evils and
sins George W. Bush commits, and also ignore the inconsistency of
being pro-life but also pro-capital punishment.

Personally, I'm against abortion, but I typically vote Democrat
anyway, because there are a lot more issues than just abortion that
are very important.

We don't govern ourselves, representatives that we elect govern us.
Most reasonably intelligent people realize the futility of trying to
follow all the important issues.  A pure (non-representative)
democracy would be a huge failure, because people would vote without
the in-depth knowledge necessary to cast an informed vote.

In my opinion, it's very sensible to attempt to recognize and identify
intelligent candidates who are likely to represent us well.  It goes
without saying that I feel George W. Bush is easily the intellectual
inferior of John Kerry.  But that fact alone isn't why I've chosen to
cast my vote for John Kerry this election.

I'll vote for John Kerry even though I may feel there are better
candidates because, for this election cycle at least, the alternative
is allowing George W. Bush to be re-elected, and based on George W.
Bush's performance, I consider him grossly underqualified for the job
of President of the United States due to the repeated disasterous
choices he makes, and the complete and utter lack of common sense he
has demonstrated, not to mention the fact that he knowingly and
willingly lies to the American public far too often.

I must, in good conscience, vote against George W. Bush, which is
subtly different than voting for John Kerry, because it seems
glaringly obvious to me he'll continue to do a non-trivial amount of
serious damage to the United States.

I think you're completely wrong to suggest it's best to vote for your
favorite candidate in all circumstances.  Sometimes voting for your
second choice will ultimately do less damage to the country you love,
than voting for your first choice.

Before you get too comfortable on your Republican high horse, I
personally know several Libertarians that are voting for George W.
Bush this election cycle, instead of their desired candidate, Michael
Badnarik (I hope I spelled that right).  I don't see how that's any
different than Ralph Nader voters choosing John Kerry instead this
election cycle.

Besides, I lost quite a bit of respect for American voters during the
last election cycle.  To select a president like George W. Bush who is
so obviously incompetent, and then re-elect him (which I feel is very
likely), demonstrates to me that American voters have become too
stupid, ignorant, or both to make any kind of sensible choice of
candidate.  Call me a snob if you will, but it remains my opinion.

It is our civic duty to do what we think is best for America, and that
often involves choosing your second, or even third, preferred
candidate, instead of your first preferred candidate.

Who are you to suggest that doing what you feel is best for your
country is the wrong thing to do?  Shouldn't that be the very
definition of being a patriot, an American?

That is bullshit.  You are suggesting the system is as good as it
gets, and that is self-defeating thinking.  We can always do better,
and should always be open minded enough to try to tweak the system for
better performance, even if that means we've made a mistake and
temporarily made the system temporarily perform worse.

There is a reason our founding fathers designed the system so it could
be modified.  It's because they knew the system might need to be
tweaked for best performance, as America aged.

And as I've demonstrated, voting your conscience often means you
select your second or third favorite candidate, and it's a very
American, very patriotic, very ethical, and very smart thing to do.
