Are you kidding me?  You've never heard anyone on a gaming forum use the
word "faggot".  It's the most overused word among the gaming public.  The
page is just a place where gay people can go and not get ragged on, should
sexuality come up in a post, which it already has on my forums.  (there is a
patch to make max payne nude...and have a big ding dong..grin)  Make sense
to you?
