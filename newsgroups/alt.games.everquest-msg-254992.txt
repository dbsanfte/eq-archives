If you can bring a shaman and some DPS, possibly some more healing
power, go to Riwwi.  I farmed a lot of fairly nice monkey gear there
before they recently made the named summon.  Note that while the named
hit for around 1k, they either dont quad or or have lower attack
skills since I and others (6k Rangers and Beastlords...no plate tanks
usually) were tanking these from time to time).
