I have one character that is allready on thurgadin faction and have a
character now that is a beastlord.
  Immthinking of getting him on giant faction. Im wondering if there would
be any advantage to being on giant faction over dwarf. Ive never been into
kael yet on either character and have not killed faction to either raise or
lower it yet.
  Being on thurg faction i can go into Cobalt Scar and Skyshrine , what
zones would be open to me and safe on the giants faction.?

.Thanks for any tips or advice.

Michial
