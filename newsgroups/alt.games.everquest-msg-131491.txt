Well then thats not a poorly designed system its a poorly weighted system...
unless you can design a system that awards points for the raid post facto.
Hmm, there's a suggestion.  All items are given set point values.  Come
to a raid, and we tally up all the drop values at the end, divide by number
of participants, and there you go.  Of course we have to retain fractions
for this to work, but heck its all on computer anyway.  If you hate fractions
inflate all drop values by a factor of 100 and then round off the per person
value of the raid at the end.

Your system has not a zero sum, but a negative sum, by the way, since the
Lowest value is 10, then only if all three are 10pointers will you see 30
points,
more likely the other two are higher and you will see fewer points in the
guild after the raid then before the raid.

The guild I'm currently in uses set point values for time spent on the raid,
but a pure bidding system for value of items, so that its impossible
to predict how many points might be spent on a raid.  Nonetheless I
think we are looking at around 180 points for a good long raid with
30 participants

This is one nice feature of the "bidding" system, nothing rots.  I've bid one
point for quite a few items that eventually went for 40 or more... and
I've gotten an item for three points that you'd think would have brought
in at least 20, just because noone wanted to spend points on it.  As long
as someone is willing to spend even one point on it nothing rots.  Rots is
stupid, almost any item will give you an upgrade in a save or two or give
you some improvement on at least one angle, perhaps one you don't normally
need, but -something- for at least one participant in the raid.

I guess I'd be more understanding of a points system if I'd seen a lot of
"sunshine" players.  Perhaps I'm just blind, but I've noticed so few of these
that points seems like a solution in search of a problem.

I can see where a system that kept anyone from standing atop
the heap for long periods of time wouldn't annoy me nearly
as much as the ones I've suffered in the past.  Thus far, I've
seen at least three guilds where my model of "A Ranked"
players continuously claiming all the Phat Lewt has held true,
the worst offender being the guild I recently left, where
on several occaisions one individual claimed as many as five
loots in a row and -still- had more than twice my point total..
and I was in the upper 20% of point totals in the guild.  We
were working TOV for SS drops, which meant quite a few
plate drops per raid, and yet I was able to see that I'd have
to raid about 20 more times on average before I got more than
a luckly piece... and by that point the "high point" people would
all be at higher point totals than when they started doing TOV
in the first place.

Personally, I probably quit long before getting my ring.  Why?  Cause I
want to enjoy the game.  Despite the Vision, I don't like doing the same thing
again and again with no benefit possible.  What would encourage me to stay?
Another Taboo Topic/personal axe to grind: arranging the raid so that
the (often volumnuous) exp is shared around instead of being concentrated
in one group while everyone pretends that "there is no Exp in a raid"
Suddenly we'd be doing a mass exp grind while getting our buddies their
rings.

I'd love to try officer descision some time, although I'd think it would
-suck- to be that officer.

Nice thing about random (to me) is that when that big uber drop goes to
the guy who plays once a week, you know he was simply lucky to get
it.  Be happy for him, hope you beat him next time.  At least it was fair
and you know that your chances were the same as everyone else's, and
-not- based on anyone's personal bias.

I agree that Points is one of the ways to solve the Sunshine problem,
I just don't see a lot of Sunshine going on, and I'd like to think that
the problem could be solved on an officer to guildmember, one to
one basis, instead of via a sledgehammer that (to my experience thus
far) causes more problems than it solves.

Perhaps thats true at the highest levels of the game... or maybe I just
don't see the need for the "best of the best" approach.  I've happily
accumulated some fairly decent gear, a few Uber pieces, a few
gaping holes (I was wearing a forest loop until quite recently when I
did the POTC quest) and haven't had many complaints at all.  Of
course I'm a fashion nightmare, since I have one drop from here
and one from there and another from that third spot... while I do
see some people who've used your approach, and therefore are
wearing full cleric gold at one level, then later are wearing full Grape,
then later full Thurg grey, then full SS aqua... cause they collected
their armor in sets.  I wear (and have always worn) such a mishmosh
of items that I've been accused of going for the Clown look, but
I simply don't care about the look, go for the best stat or clicky item
out of each set with no regard for appearances, and then go on after
higher level mobs looking for better and more interesting stuff.

It probably helps that I'm a cleric, and can do my job almost as
well stark naked on a CR as in full kit.

The point systems I've seen so far have meant that Player A gets -all-
drops while player B never sees any at all; while the random systems I've
seen have accorded B items in proportion to his attendance.  Now in
a large discrepancy such as you suggest, A is still getting 35/40ths
of the loot, while B is getting only 5/40ths, but at least in B's perception
he is getting 50% of the loot when he plays with A.  Assuming A
always groups with -some- B, then Each B is getting 50% of the
loot when he's playing(5/70ths), and A now gets 50% of the loot (35/70ths)
as well.  Why should it matter whether A is playing with another A
or with a series of B's?  In a points system, A playing with another
A will see 50% of the  loot, but A playing with a series of B's will
see 100% of the loot!

The guild I'm in is also player based but has had a lot of recent defections
to more achievement oriented guilds, I'm sure that this new points
approach is dedicated to trying to stem that tide.  Oddly, it seems to
me that the people remaining must be the -more- player inclined and
that responding to the people that already left is going to have the
opposite of the desired effect on the people that didn't leave, but I'm
not an officer and am not privy to internal policy discussions of that
nature, perhaps a large portion of the remainder -also- feel that a
change is needed to prevent them jumping ship as well, and were merely
more willing to discuss matters than the defectors.
