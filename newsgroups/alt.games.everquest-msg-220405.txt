Someone in my guild mentioned this and I figured I'd throw it out here and
get this groups thoughts.

For just warriors (or maybe all melee)...
just like casters get a specialization in a casting skill, allow WAR to get
the same thing for a melee skill (1HB, 2HS, 2HP, etc..)

What the specialization would allow is:
  Cannot train a specialization until level 30
  Work the same as other skills (lvl * 5 + 5) max 250
  Only one specialize over 50

  When specialized with a weapon and using said weapon...
       ...different damage table
       ...higher hate generated
       ...higher damage bonus
       ...greater chance for procs

  With specializations you can reset them (just like casters) all back to a
set amount (50), and then retrain the one you want back up to max.

  Other weapons (non specialized) work normally.

*************************

  one of the reasons for this being warrior only would be to:
  help warriors generate more hate
  help warriors generate more DPS (but not to the point they break DPS
classes)


Thoughts and Flames welcome...(okay flames not really welcomed)
