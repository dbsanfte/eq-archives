Even though the "Ebay baby"post was
as an urban legion.The thought of a moving  zone intrigues me.
An entrance to a zone that moves each month to a different location,much
like the castle in the movie "krull".,It would be wonderful.Ofcourse it
would have to be a mid to high level zone.Obviously the zone wouldn't move
just the "gate"to the zone.much like the tree you have to "click"on to get
to the plane of growth.Anyway what do you think?
