Actually, that is the exact reason why they should devote
cash/manpower to EQ2. EQ1 has so many bugs and problems due to its 7
year old engine and lack of ugradeability. EQ2 is out in winter of
2003, NOT next december but the next one (a year and a half plus) By
that time its kind of doubtful with so many other products that anyone
who has been playing EQ1 for 4 and half years would still be playing
it anyway. 

It takes SO long to make these games, they need to look ahead to
compete. If they don't, they become like those jackass idiots at
Electronic Arts who pulled the plug on the 3d UO2 which looked
fantastic because they did not want to split market share with their
already existing UO. Consequently, I think at last report UO1 was
played by about 60,000 month to month subscribers while EQ has more
like 450,000. There you go, Verant does not want "EQ" to be like UO in
a year and a half.
