*blinks* Hmm, interesting.  Did you miss this line from my post?

.."It's interesting how jokes seem to take on different flavors.  I've heard
these two, only they where a bit different."..

I was making a comment on how it's interesting that the same joke
can have different flavors.  Then added the versions I had heard.
Didn't know I was nitpicking.  Thought I was making an observation that
I found interesting and giving examples.  Unless I have a history of nitpicking
jokes in the group that I'm not aware of, I'm a bit surprised at your reaction.
Sorry if you thought I was attacking you, your joke or your sense of humor.

... *hands DT some bubble wrap* Install that.  Maybe It'll help prevent
some of those nasty ego bruises from unintentional bumps.
