Which is why He is refered to as the uncaused first cause.  Either way,
there must be something at the beginning.  A diety is no less likely than a
"primordial mass."

Is that your analogy, or did you borrow it?  I just want to know who to
attribute it to when I use it.

Alternate concept.  Man was meant to fall.  Adam knew that much from the
beginning.  Being that man had not sinned, he could not be removed from Eden
without God committing an injustice.  So, Adam was given a choice.  He could
eat the fruit of knowledge, which he was forbidden* and be cast from Eden
becoming mortal, and beginning the chain of events of humanity, or he could
eat the fruit of life, and return to live with God.

* God's command not to eat the fruit was so that there would be a basis for
casting Adam from Eden.  Gaining the knowledge was not a sin in it's own
right, it was simply disobeying a (necessarily) arbitrary command.
Basically, it was Adam's way of choosing to become mortal, or saying he was
ready to begin life.
