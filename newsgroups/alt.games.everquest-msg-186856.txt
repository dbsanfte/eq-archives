They're not so common. They drop an average of about 1 time in 10.
Plus, people rarely get them unless they're deliberately after them.
They take multiple groups of 55+ types or a 4+ 63+ types. At 61+, they
are zero experience.

In short form, they cost that much because people are willing to pay
it. People are willing to pay it because they are part of a worthwhile
reward and hard to get.
