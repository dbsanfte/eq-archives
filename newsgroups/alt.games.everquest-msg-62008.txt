My bad on the bonus thing. You were referring to the str bonus, not the new
2hs bonus VI implemented.
But I stand by the statement of not everyone having primal or being able to
get it. If you have it, good for you. But just remember not EVERYONE does.
And to use primal weapons as an example when speaking of the "average" tank
on any server just lets us know for sure without seeing the scar on the
forehead.
