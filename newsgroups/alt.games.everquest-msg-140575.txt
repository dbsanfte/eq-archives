I had the opposite problem once: my jboots were slow.  They were giving a
10% speed boost instead of 34%.  It was interesting, in that it was zone
specific.  E.g., in South Karana, they were slow, but in East Commons, they
were fine.  Go back to SK, and they were slow again.

This was right after a patch, and the problem was gone next time I logged
in.  I suspect that there is a bug, and that it was the source of those
rumors that we used to get after every patch that jboots had been nerfed.  I
haven't heard such rumors in a while, so perhaps whatever it was has been
fixed.
