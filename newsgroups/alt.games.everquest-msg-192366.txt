------------------------------

- Fixed a problem with "burst" damage causing too much aggro.  Attacks that
do a lot of damage in a short time no longer cause more aggro than they
should.

- Feign Death has been restored to the functionality it had before the
patch.

- Fixed an issue that caused aggro from damage shields to be assigned
incorrectly.

- Removed a bug that could cause certain types of encounters, such as the
Rallos Zek encounter in the Plane of Tactics, to crash a zone.

- Fixed a bug that could cause a crash when you tried to bring up the item
display window for bags and notes.
