I felt bad when with my first pet class, the Beastlord, when I got my pet
killed, but seriously it's a resource, not a PC. That thing saved my but on
more than one occassion when I got caught in a train and it took the mobs
while I ran to zone! Thank you my expendible buddy!

In all actuallity, like any spell is wears off, so if thinking of it as more
of a spell makes you feel better, then so be it.
