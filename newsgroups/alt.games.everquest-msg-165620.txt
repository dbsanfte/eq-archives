Thanks for the suggestions, all. I logged on last night and actually
got some experience for the first time in weeks. I did the shopping
list quest in the Plane of Knowledge (two blue bubbles for about
twenty minutes of low-risk work--not too shabby), and I killed my very
first sand giant in Oasis.

  I'd forgotten how much fun a worldwide vengeance tour could be. Not
only did I kill something I'd never killed before, I also got revenge
for all the times I was hunting in Oasis and heard the dreaded cry of
"SG!" two seconds before getting flattened. The thirty-odd platinum,
fine steel sword, and lambent stone he dropped didn't hurt either.

  On top of all that, I got a bit of a charge out of finally becoming
one of the higher-level characters running around Oasis who would wipe
out the sand giants and make the world safe for caiman and orc
hunting. =)

Now if I can just find some more spare time, I'm set...
