There are several strategies which might work, the simplest and most
fun for me is to kill all pumas and spiders while having a tracker.
Not even sure if the spiders make a difference, but you get a lot of
spider silk while wasting time (as well as some terroantuala silk)

The tracking is good, as well as being able to kill fast. You'll see
something like this if tracking:

Puma
puma
puma
puma
spider type
spider type
spider type
spider type

You kill those, asap. If you are a 56 druid like me, or have the help
of one, make sure you have KEI on. You will barely have a few mintues
to sit and get mana back before:

Puma
Puma
puma (sometimes up to six)

Spider type
spider type 
spider type (ditto, somtimes up to six.)

Boom, kill.

Somtimes instead, you will see the rares. 

A sand mummy 
A terroantunla
Terrorantulings (as a group, not as rare as other types, also drop the
silk)
Ancient Cylcops

I never worried about any other mobs, this was enough. I read about
this strategy on allakhazam's and got the AC in about 50 minutes, with
no one else in the zone for close to two hours that night, at around 3
am central time.

Its cool to do while tracking, since you see exactly how it works. If
even one mob of the special type is up, such as a sand mummy, or even
one mob of a group (such as one of six pumas or spiders), the next
wave won't spawn. You kill them, boom, next wave.

I don't know if other groups work, but these two seemed the simplest
as well as actually having stuff you can use. Of course, its a bad
idea at the moment because the Fabled Terrorantula who summons and
hits for a lot, spawned on me and a guy the other night.. AIEEEEE.

I killed nothing else but what I listed, no SGS, etc. By being the
only one there, it also kept other people from killing things to make
it more likely that SGs spawned. Pumas and spiders ONLY led to more
pumas and spiders, or the specials that I named (may have forgot one
or two.) You'd think you'd have to kill undead for the special PH
sandmummy, but not so, they'll all spawn with this strategy.
