I think if anything, I'm playing more - at least until the realities

Heck, I spent maybe ten hours gathering data for the tailoring guide.
I don't know if that really counts as playing though - my level 40

But apart from that, I spent a LOT of time exploring. Some really
gorgeous zones out there.
