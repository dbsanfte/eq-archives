I know what you mean there, I saw a 47th level Enchanter, afk being
attacked, unsuccessfully by a  Bixie, I waited a while to see if he was
gonna come back and respond but didn't. So I killed it and then said "Saved
ya life bra, close one"  (think Keanu Reeves in Point Break)
I zone and while running across WC I get a tell saying "You didn't save my
life, it did less than 5 damage in about 10mins"
Hmmm, I explain I was joking and it was a quote from the film, which in turn
he hasn't seen so I recommend it to him as a good buddy action movie.
What gets me is did he really think that I believed a bixie could have
killed him? My character was 24th at the time so he'd have been very red to
me even if I hadn't done a / all <name> (which I did) Oh well, at least I
didn't get abuse from the guy, we just ended up talking movies :ï¿½)
