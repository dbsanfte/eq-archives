   Doesn't bother me.  I know to keep to the right wall out of Rivenvale.  I
made that run scores of times before there were the books.  Even at night, and
never had a problem.

   Well, I had a problem the first time, before I knew about the whole "Bad
thing happen after dark" and the "For god's sake keep the hell off the path!"
things.
