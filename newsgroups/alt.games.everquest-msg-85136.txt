Yes, buy a hardware router, and forget about Sygate. Sygate is not a bad
product at all, I have been using it for over a year now with just one
Everquest account and had no problems. Since I will be moving to the USA
soon (and i don't even know wether cable or DSL is avaialable yet, and there
is a voltage difference) i haven't bought a router yet, but I would have.

Routers are ideal. They are not too expensive (you can get a good one for
around $100) and they use almost no electricity so they save you a lot if
one of your comps is on 24h a day. (that costs about $30 to $50 a year
anyways since computers are not known to be energy efficient if harddisks
and screensavers keep running at least 12 hours a day)

They work really good with Everquest too, and the little devices are MEANT
to be used with multiple computers.
