}Pitiful. :-)  But seriously, I've got a 4-year-old box with:

Just out of curiosity, have you tried opening your system.ini file and 
adding the line 

MaxPhysPage=40000

in the [386enh] section? That will sometimes help a win98 machine 
recognize more memory.  I thought the cutoff was more like 550 or 700 megs 
though.
