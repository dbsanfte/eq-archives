I could be mistaken, but if memory serves me correctly, the US gave
the Taliban numerous opportunities to hand over the terrorists. We
offered to help them. The Taliban decided that they would harbor these
criminals knowing full well that we would strike. They have themselves
to blame. If they had any morals at all, they would have handed them
over. If you can't see this, then maybe you don't have any (morals)
either.
