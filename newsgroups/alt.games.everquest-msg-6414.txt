So if I got an automatic car and replaced the transmission with a
manual one it would be more efficient than buying a manual? I don't
think so somehow. Work out the power consumption of an automatic
transmission including all the monitoring equipment as well as the
gear change mechanism and the power that draws is your loss in economy
over a manual.

An automatic transmission takes energy to use, this comes from the
engine, therefore the economy is worse than an identical manual
transmission. (Putting on your Air Conditioning, lights or radio also
reduce your economy as they all require power to run and open windows,
open sunroofs and car radio aerials reduce economy as they interfere
with the drag coefficient).
