Do your best to get a satisfactory explanation and get the money back.  If
after every effort they refus, /guildremove  Don't immediatly kick them b/c
then you know you won't get the money back for the victim.

The GM was correct.  When you hit trade, as long as nothing goes wrong, alls
fair.  Nothing wrong meaning no duping, no poofing during an LD trade,
etc...   In this case she Gave him 10kpp.  Period.  Lies are not against
policy.  If he had said he was selling an item, knowing it would fall to
ground and got the cash and picked up the item, thats a scam and will be
handled be GM.
