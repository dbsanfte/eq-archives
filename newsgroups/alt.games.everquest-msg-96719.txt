Hello.

> What is 'twinking'?

Twinking is basically taking equipment that, under normal circumstances,
only a high level character can get and giving it to a newly created
character.  It usually works like this:

A person has a high level character.
They create a new character for whatever reason.
The person "twinks" a lower level character by transferring some left-over
equipment the higher level character may have to the lower level character
(done a variety of ways).

Not that this is inherently bad or anything.  Some people approve of it,
some don't.  Personally, I don't care one way or the other.  If a person
wants to twink, it isn't exactly hurting anyone (except for the person who
is being twinked, arguably).
