You're missing their point. The problem isn't that you need help for
the trials, it's that there's a huge imbalance with some classes
having a trivial time getting though and others just not being able to
get a group because they're useless, shaman being the prime example of
that. A well balanced group of lvl 62 (chanter, cleric, shaman, druid,
SK, warrior) couldn't make it though, whereas the group of friends
that flagged me (65 cleric, warrior, rogue, Ranger) did it easily with
4 people, two of us were just along for the ride. I get the feeling
those are gonna be the ones happiest with the change. No more having
to spend time flagging friends as they hit 60. One nice thing about
being a shaman is that nobody ever asked me to help them get flagged,
maybe park in PoJ and log on to buff after wipes while playing an alt
but that was as bad as it got.
