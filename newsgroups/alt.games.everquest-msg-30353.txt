I always try to warn about a train, but when I am playing my warrior, and
don't have sow, I've found that I just can't do that, and run, because I'm
holding down that control key to keep one step ahead of the mobs, and my
hotkeys won't work at that point.  If I have enough hp left that I can take
a moment to hit the hotkey, I do, if I don't think I can make it, I just run
for the zone, and anyone sitting there will just have to fend for themselves
on the tracks.
