Hehe, no idea, he just told me that he got ported down there and got 
killed, and needed help to get the corpse back out. Appearantly he 
thought it was draggable, so wanted me to head down and get his corpse

Since Glox dont say anything, i guess the guy must have read about the 
quest, and were stupid enough to say the trigger phrase.
