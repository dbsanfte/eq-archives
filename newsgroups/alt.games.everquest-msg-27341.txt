First this guy was obviously a newbie and likely very young.  That being
said it is not an excuse for his behavior, he appears to be another of that
vast horde of young players that entered the game this summer and have
caused loads of disruptions and conflicts in every zone they enter, either
through abuse of chat/shout, causing frequent trains, kill stealing, or just
plain arrogance and nastiness.  Until a couple of weeks ago I was fairly
tolerate of this behavior figuring they eventually learn, but after two
weeks of listening to nightly conflict in Ill Omen I am fed up.  Frankly,
the worst of these offenders seem to have been Iskar monks so if you stepped
on one, hopefully you did it hard enough that he will reappraise his
behavior and rethink his way of playing.  If so you have done him and the
rest of the people on your server a favor.  If he hasn't learned then
hopefully he will soon return to Quake or Diablo where he will be more at
home.
