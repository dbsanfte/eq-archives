Sure I can 'twist it around'... but that's not the point.

The bottom line is promos that are valued higher than the original 
product *are* the product.

If I sell you a rotten egg 50.00 but it comes with a free video card... 
you're buying the video card. And that's pretty much my assessment of 
LoE and its promo. For the amount of money they appear to want for a 
me-too RTS the only way it could be worth it is if you've attached 
considerable value to the beta.

That makes the beta the product. And I find that offensive, even if it 
was inevitable.
