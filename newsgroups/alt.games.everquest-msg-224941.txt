They don't get to see medical details but they do get to know if you have
had any form of workers compensation. They won't know if it was for the
common cold or ebola - they just know you were getting some form of payment
when you were not present and accounted for.

If an employer get's 30 applications for a job, the first thing they do is
throw away those with a tick in "criminal record", the second thing they do
is throw away those with a tick in "workers compensation". Then they start
reading the remaining applications...

Besides that - an insurance company underwrites the temp medical pensions.
My chances of obtaining simple things like private health insurance for
example would be great if they have a file on me containing details like:
Major Depressive Disorder, Dysthymia, Generalised Anxiety Disorder, Avoidant
and Dependant Personality Traits... Of course that was just a random example
conditions... *coughs*
