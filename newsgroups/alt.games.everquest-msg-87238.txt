Last night my lvl27 druid was in Hollowshade Moor zone.  I decided to fear
kite sonic wolves (blue to me).  I find a lone sonic and cast
Snare...Resisted.  I think "Ok I'll run ahead and try again".  Btw, these
wolves are *fast*.  I get off another Snare....Resisted.

I counted 16 resists on Snare before one finally landed and was able to Gate
away.  I was down to about one third health and one quarter mana left.  Is
this resist rate normal for these wolves.  I was *very* frustrated!

Also, when I cast Wolfform in this zone and in North Karana, spell icon
showed up but I was not transformed into a wolf.  I asked another druid in
the zone to test it and he had the same results.  Is the spell bugged now?
I did receive the increases from the spell, just no graphic.
