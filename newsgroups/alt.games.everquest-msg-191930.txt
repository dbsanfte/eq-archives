Which has nothing to do with this item, according to the explanation given
by the anonymous evaluator. Perhaps you should suggest this to him. Please
note my complaint that a single person should not be considered an authority
on such matters as this.

The final item in the message that you're replying to:
Un2ia.23359$0g4.912309@news2.east.cox.net
The Message-ID for the OP: Un2ia.23359$0g4.912309@news2.east.cox.net
The only requirement for a valid Referneces header is that these two match
and that there is no truncation, except under certain extreme circumstances.

BTW: I do know how to make sure I'm posting to the correct ng.
