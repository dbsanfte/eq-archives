 Most likely bind rushing of certain mobs was frowned upon by Verant. I
can't say I disagree with this change. I wish they would have left a
bind location at the banker, though. It's not a far run there from WL
zone side but...

 Wonder if the boat wizard has been removed. If not that makes a great
multi-access bind point.

 You probably wouldn't unless you parsed some log files and looked
closely. I wonder which way they were incorrect. My staff showed a 20
bonus so I wonder if it was doing more or less.

 I'd like to try that out. I know one of my gimps still has problems
with half the greens I run into.


 The group buffs for others is a nice change.

 Also another good change is the corpse poofing to zone thing. This used
to happen so many times in ToV it wasn't funny. I guess they got tired
of having to come over there every time a raid got wiped out and 10% of
the corpse ended up being bugged.
