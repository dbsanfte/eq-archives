Just because you play solo doesn't mean you are alone, there are lots of 
folks to interact with.  I think you are just used to soloing folks who 
want to play a solo game rather than soloing folks who want to play a 
multiplayer game since the former seem to be the majority and in their 
case I am guessing roleplaying has nothing to do with the game at all.

When EQ was first released I created a paladin on a server away from my 
friends on my regular server for the express purpose of roleplaying him 
as a knight errant.  He felt his god's will was for him to never group, 
but instead to wander alone, killing evil and helping good folks he came 
upon in his travels.  Some of the best roleplaying I've ever done in my 
life was with this character.  He not only roleplayed when others were 
around, he stayed in character when alone.  Towards the end when he felt 
that his god willed him to never run from a battle it didn't matter if 
there were no other players to see him run for a zone line, he stood his 
ground in the name of faith.

If others are around then a solo roleplayer can interact with them, if 
not the character itself can be more than enough if you have some 
imagination.
