Actually, I was just noticing this the other day... Clicking on the table 
gives you the 'locked' message.  But by clicking on the book itself, you 
can set it to spinning around!

I'm wondering if there's some particular direction you can have the book 
facing that will allow you to 'open' the table by some means...
