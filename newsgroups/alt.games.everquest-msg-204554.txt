Question: How do you make a small fortune in tradeskilling in Everquest?
Answer: Start with a large fortune <rimshot>

However, for information on tradeskills of all types, go to
http://www.eqtraders.com/
and look around on the site. Please do not simply go to the message boards
and ask how can I make a lot of money doing x tradeskill, people will get
annoyed at you.
I will warn you that the major malfuction with easy to level up tradeskills
is everyone levels them up easily and noone can sell anything those master
whatevers can make for more than a few copper profit.
