It's software.

The basic problem with a software firewall is a design flaw- the firewall 
is on the machine it is meant to protect. While it does help, it is not 
nearly as secure as a dedicated hardware firewall.

Onre thing of note here is that most DSL routers(others will call them 
modems which is completely inaccurate) can function as firewalls.
