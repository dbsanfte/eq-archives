It's one thing to actually announce that you are gonna pull a wanderer so
that your tank can come back and kill it, but the first post was about a
chanter that didn't announce.  I'm a ranger and EVERY pull I do is
announced, even if I'm standing next to my group.  In my usual groups, I
wouldn't want a chanter pulling anything.  Usually when a group member sees
a wanderer they do /gsay Hail, %T  to tell the puller what's out there,
instead of pulling it themselves and getting the party killed.
