Yeah!!!!!!!!
HELL YEAH!!!!!!!!

And my necro should get all the fucking xp even if I let my pet do all
the work and I just sit there.

YEAH!!!!!

ummmmmmm... no. It's a pet class, sadly. You'll have to do part of the
work yourself. Do you really think that lower level necros and mages are
all that tough without their pets? You may be a "weak monk" without your
pet, but I bet you can still out-melee my necro, level for level, by a
wide margin.
