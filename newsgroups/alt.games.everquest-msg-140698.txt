You are way off.

> Mosquito Eye earring  - pickup group in CT

Yes but its rare.  These earrings, and all of the droppable ones from CT
sell for 50K+ on Trib, and you really never see them sold since they are
upgrades for nearly anyone who would loot them.

Yes the maze quest.  Two groups?  I havent ever seen two groups do it.
Its real hard to keep the gnome safe, and unaggrod on PCs.

rather,
> 1 person and 3 bots)

Most people arent going to do this with three, but yeah I guess it could
be done.  The spider pops very close to the spires and its a 2 pull.

> arnaks)  - 1/2 person  "quest"

LOL 1/2 person quest?  Whats that about?  And getting just to warmly is
a chore.  You are scowling forever if you start max KOS.

> Zombie Flesh Wristband -  pickup group (ct i think)

Uh no.  From Dracoliche in Fear.

> Gloves of Viscid Slime (his uber-loot) -  2-3 group thing (btw u think
the
> ft4 gloves are > his 100hp bracer, James?)

This from ring of slime?  I suppose 2-3 groups could do, but you are
trying to make the case that this gear, and thus exceeding the cap, is
all obtainable from the guy in the non-uber guild.  I submit that a
non-uber guild isnt going to be doing this encounter with 2-3 groups.

can

LOL yeah the 8th Coldain is _so_ easy.  Man you have a penchant for
understatement.


> Thurg quest robe - same as quest arms

Not peanuts though.  MQ for this will run 25Kish, plus gems.

I think this is Draco only.  So, just being able to kill him isnt
enough.  He has to spawned.  Which, on Tribunal, is not likely.

> Boots of Flowing Slime - Pickup CT group

Rare though, and 70K+ if you want to buy.

Haha.  Yeah this epic is cake, eh?  There are only 50 other ppl begging
and scratching to get at the broken at any one time.

Not expensive?  35K+ on Trib.  Thats expensive to me.  Even at that
price, these are not sold often.

We arent talking about a wizard in a guild that can kill CT with 25 ppl.
We are talking about joe_average_wiz99 remember?  His guild cant kill CT
with 25, and probably cant kill him at all because the guilds that CAN
kill him with 25 do because his loot rocks for how easy he is.  But lets
say this wiz gets his guild to a full pop fear.  50 people to kill CT,
how many of them wanting the brain?  Quite a few I am sure.

Would be?  You are delusional man.  COULD be.

My guild is very large, we have about 100 active players, 90+ of us are
60.  We are not in the top class of guilds on Trib, but we are in the
rung below them.  We do NToV, kill Tunare, have killed nearly all of the
Luclin ubers outside of Ssra/VT.  We have no one over the old cap.  No
one.  We have one wizard who was within 100 points, and a couple of
druids who were within 200.

You tell me.
