As someone else posted in this thread, only large races, who have the
slam ability, can bash without using a shield.  Bash will stun the mob
so it's very useful against caster mobs to interrupt their spell
casting (however, at level 55, warriors get the ability to stun mobs
with the kick skill).  

You can use the "ghetto-bashing" (or "Ruatha-bashing", named for
Ruatha, a gnome warrior who came up with the technique).  It involves
making hot keys with your secondary slot with your secondary weapon,
an inventory slot with a shield, and the "bash" skill, then using your
mouse to switch out your secondary weapon with your shield, then
hitting the "bash" key, then switching back in your secondary weapon.
I found a description at:

3.3 Should I bash/slam?
By all means yes, bashing a monster to interrupt spellcasting or stun
it is very valuable.  Large races can slam, but small races should use
the ghetto/Ruatha bash method.  To do this, set up a hotkey bank with
your secondary melee slot and one of your inventory slots, next to
each other or one on top of the other, along with the Bash button.
Put your shield in the inventory slot and go into combat while dual
wielding.  Click on the shield to pick it up and move the cursor over
the secondary melee slot, and leave it there.  When bash is ready,
click the mouse to switch items, press bash (using the number keys,
not the mouse), then click to switch back.  Practice with a cheap
weapon and shield in case you drop them, until you feel confident that
you won't drop your items.
