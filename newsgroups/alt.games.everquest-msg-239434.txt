yeah, thats a good point.. part of the berserker epic is piss hard to get
(the end part, actually, trial 8 I think its called?)
its a timed event when you need alot of melee dps, the mobs are practically
100% resistant to spells, and it took quite a bit of the alliance to get a
guild member his epic, plus it took 4 tries)


At any rate.. I dont really care either way.  yeah it would be nice if they
upgraded the rest of our epics, I may actually bother to finish mine if they
did. but thats wishful thinking right now.
