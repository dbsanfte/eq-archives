  And it's mine now!  Muahahaha!

    Actually since I don't have a scanner, there aren't really too many pics of
me on the web at all (ok, I admit it wasn't really me in that teeshirt ad).  But
since we are in the computer age, I think it might be impossible for there not
to be a picture of somewhere of virtually anyone in North America.  A little
digging and I found this one:

   Yeah, it's a bit on the old side as well (as you can tell by the bouquet I'm
holding).  Just about 18 years old.  I forgot that I had gotten my hair permed
for my wedding, normally my hair is alot straighter than in this shot.  And no,
I didn't wear white.  I had been living with Lenny for about four months before
the big day, and I didn't see the point of going out and buying a new dress.
