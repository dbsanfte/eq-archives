From the logs I read, sparky, some of them had been suspended, if not banned
before. Some of them were soul marked. Some were talking about how screwed
they were, some were talking about their new accounts and what they would be
playing, others talked about the next game they were going on to.

Now some good folk seems to be honestly unaware. More is the pity.  Verant
had the producer of the phone, Jeff Butler. Doesn't sound like a rash
decision, or a first time offense.

And they were not banned of the CoH thing, it seems they were more concerned
with the ress effect bugging out the dragon AE.
