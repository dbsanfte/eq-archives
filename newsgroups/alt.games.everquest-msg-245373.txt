Hi All

According to people in-game, when they ding 20 they now get a popup
message suggesting they to go to Mistmoore for great xp.  Now, zone
had good xp before they made it a Hot Zone and it must be really great
now, but this is a zone where if enough mobs aggro, even a 60+ could
get killed fairly swiftly.

I went to have a look today, as I was in there with my little rogue
last week getting the Blood Spirits, and it was usually deserted. It
was bedlam in there tonight :D  About 12 dead bodies at the zone line
alone, about the same scattered all the way up to the ramp to the
Castle. Frequent shouts of "train to zone" and, indeed, the trains
were amazing in size and firepower.

There is a sort of "ripple effect" as the higher-level people in the
zone pull too many tough mobs (Harbingers mostly, but once I saw Sir
Bronthas himself in a train!), and they run to the zone line.  The
people not quite as far inside, fighting their own mobs, see the train
on the way, and they ALSO run to zone.  The people AT the zone line -
usually about 4 to 8 at around 20 to 25 - get a horde of very nasty
mobs in their lap, and carnage ensues.

If you are tempted to risk Mistmoore at lvl 20 to 30, keep a VERY
careful watch.  The mobs in there all seem to cast spells, and they
not only Root and nuke, they have a nasty way of casting spells that
act as a Stun for about 10 to 15 seconds or so, so you can't even cast
a Gate or Feign Death.
