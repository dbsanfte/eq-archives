To answer Adam's question, my definition of soloing comes fromt he
source of the term: Solo. ALONE. If someone is giving you buffs or
anything at all to help you along, you're not doing it alone. Even if
you're buying these things, you're getting outside help. So, by strict
definition, you're not soloing. Of course, like I said, I only brought
up the strict, technical definition in an attempt to be a smartass. Of
course, I should have expected the rabid wolverenes to jump on me over
it...
