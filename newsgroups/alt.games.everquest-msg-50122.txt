For Old World ports, 10 or 20 is about right.  But I never fuss over less.
Unless I agreed on a price ahead of time, I have no right to expect any
specific amount.  1 plat and an apology from the player that he/she couldn't
afford more this time around pretty much guarantees I will port them again
if I see them asking /ooc for one later on.  For me it is very much about
courtesy.  One pet peeve of mine, though -- "THX" is the sound system they
use in movies nowadays.  It is not adequate compensation for my time.
"Thank you" on the other hand, is plenty.

I digress, as I always seem to do.  I can say this much for myself.  I will
pretty much always port a char who /auctions or /oocs he or she will pay 10
plat if I am not grouped and if the char is willing to come to me.  If
because of faction or other reasons, the char cannot come to where I am in
the zone, I will often come and meet them.  In this latter case, 20 plat
seems more appropriate.
