I just hit LV12.  I've got my new spells now, all scribed into my book
(except for "Focus Death", located somewhere in Luclin I've read, and "Scent
of Dusk").
    I'm looking for a new place to hunt, LV, and maybe even some decent loot
(though that's not as important as I've got 200pp in the bank, and I'm
likely dubious or KOS to the merchants...just under 400 orc deaths, at least
200-250 from orc1 or orc2 in EC & I'm still dubious to commons residents).
    I've been hunting in EC allot lately.  Mainly because of the player
economy as being my way to fund my spells, and the 200pp I spent on my Stein
of Moggok.  I've thought about the Desert of Ro & Oasis, but that either
requires grouping to kill orcs, or soloing and worrying about madmen &
mummies & anything else in there.  It's not bad, but it's repetitive.
That's why I'm looking for something new.
    Where is a good place for one of the best solo classes to solo?  I'm
mainly looking for the EXP, though a decent supply of coin & items to be
sold for more coin would be helpful for later.
    Here are some places I've thought about, how will I do on them, and
which is good or bad ideas?
1) Aviaks in Lake Rathe, just outside the arena. (those birds don't give bad
faction hits with anyone important do they?)
2) Lavastorm.
3) Estate of Unrest (requiring a boat ride).
4) Somewhere in Kunark? (I know Ill Omen is what everyone says, but that's
more exactly why I'd prefer not to do that one...and either way, if looting
is involved I'd need a place where a DE Necro can sell that is clear from
the icky Iksars.)
5) I've got Velious also, but I doubt that would be a good idea to hunt in
at LV12 (maybe 3 times this LV?).
6) Luclin?  I've got Luclin and have only played the Vah Shir city, as well
as the newbie part of the zone outside it.

    Can someone can give me advice on getting to Luclin, and getting to my
spell located there (according to
http://eq.castersrealm.com/spells/spell.asp?Id=1623 (spell info) &
http://eq.castersrealm.com/spells/vendordetails.asp?Action=Description&Id=26
4 (spell's merchant location) )?  If so then I may make this little journey
as well (I've got bind and invis so shouldn't I be OK?).  I'm just not sure
where to zone into Luclin at, or what advice I'd need in getting there.  The
pages I listed show the location of the merchant, and how to get into that
zone, but not how to get to that previous zone.

Any advice would be helpful and much appreciated.

Also (last question), I'm wearing CLOTH armor (only bought one or two
pieces, looted the others from Orc Pawns).  Can I wear Raw Silk?  Should I
get a set of it?  I've got a nice coal black robe (upgrade from my tarnished
silver color newbie robe) that I've been wearing since about LV4-5.  I'd
like to keep a more "Necro" look.  I know the raw silk robe doesn't show up
as a graphic when wearing it.  Is there another nice looking (AFFORDABLE)
robe that I can get?  Or should I keep my current one?
