Well your point is based on an assumption that there is a teleporter in
the upper room that leads to the lower room they were in.  Without that
the mob using the teleporter would appear in another part of the zone
rather than in the middle of their raid, bringing lots of friends with
him along the way.  That  sort of negates the whole idea  of fluxing the
monk up there to agro it in the first place.  If they wanted to kill all
the  mobs they would have gone the intended route and done so.  If the
mob was intended to be pulled out of that room you can be sure it  would
either have a door to go through or use the teleports.  It has neither
and  that makes it pretty clear that a valid encounter must take place
in that room.
