I left EQ for a few weeks and returned in late May to find that I can
see through ships into the water beneath the ship and portions of the
deck below. Whenever I turn or move around the deck these views are 
constantly changing and I see very little, if any, of the deck I am
on.

This did not used to be the case. Either the patching has changed something
for me or my video card settings have changed. I am using a Geforce 3 ti 200.
Can anyone suggest to me what to do/change so that my video is not so messed
up when traveling by ship?

Thanks!
