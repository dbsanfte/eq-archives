When they say it shiped that dosen't mean it shiped to stores.  Most times
it just means it has shiped to the warehouses and will then make it to the
stores on releasedays.  Sometimes the item is shipped to stores early and
then sold before realease dates.  It can be a pain in the arse for those
reading that the item has shiped.
