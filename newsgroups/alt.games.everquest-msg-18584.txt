Hi ...

A really simple question here. I'm running EverQuest in 1024*768 transparent
mode and it looks great. The thing is, I'm having a great deal of difficulty
reading the text messages, especially when the text (TELLS) is purple - The
few on-line acquaintances I've made have told me it can't be changed, but I
just wanted to post here in case someone can advise me otherwise. If
possible, I'd like to have ALL the text displayed in light blue, just like
the group chat colour. Any help would be very much appreciated.

Many thanks ...

Stevie.
