There is no excuse for that.  The hypothetical I mentioned, and the
actual cases mentioned by others, were at least 61+ spells for the
character who did the turn-in.  That is simply ridiculous, a result
that shouldn't have been possible.  They must've assigned a very
"special" programmer to write the query(s) that generated that list.
Unless, of course, "Working as intended" means "Yes, we had it very
much in mind to fuck over randomly selected Paladins", sort of an
exageration of the worst of TheVision(tm).  Yes! that could be it!
It's "Revenge of TheVision(tm)", an SOE Production, directed by
Nobody Inparticular, starring Fippy Darkpaw as "The GM".

Kaev <--- glad he's not out on the front lines getting screwed
by the inevitable errors and the "just following orders" GMs.
