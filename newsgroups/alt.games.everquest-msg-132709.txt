However, respect isn't something that can so easily be shrugged off
and excuses be made for its absence, which is what it really comes
down to. Even if the "segment of society" a person was raised in
regards profanity as okay (I don't have a problem with it myself), it
is most certainly not by far unknown to any segment of society that
the rest of society regards it as "bad". Once again, it's a matter of
a total lack of self-control and making excuses to justify it rather
than making the minimal effort required to amend that.
