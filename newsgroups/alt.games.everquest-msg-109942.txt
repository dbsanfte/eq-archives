OK, EQ2 is due. Who here is going to play? I may just wait to hear more
about it before I go and spend the money on POP. It sounds like a rocking
game so far, and the screen shots are ultra sweet.

Not to mention, people thought Luclin was a resorce hog, lol this game is
going to cause a lot of people to "need" a better computer (my self
included)
