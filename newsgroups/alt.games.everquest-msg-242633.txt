Well I just went back and reread what I wrote... it was the end of a
bad day at work and ... heh man did I go off. Sorry about that.

I did realize that it wasn't Ben who wrote it, and that the original
author would probably not ever read it, so it was a good post to rip
apart..

I hope you all realize this type of post is rare from me. I was just
letting off some steam. I should have pointed that out.
