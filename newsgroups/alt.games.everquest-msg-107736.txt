You're talking about the level 55 Divine aura?  It was my understanding that
mobs ignored DA'ed characters until it wears off (specifically to prevent
this).

Yeah, but the wizard has the ability to end a fight rather quickly.  It may
be risky, but it can be very useful in overpull situations.  Heck, it can be
very useful in normal grinding.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
