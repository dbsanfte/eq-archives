You dont know any good dps classes then . Since it requires significant raid
equipment it is not unusual to have not seen any. Casters are still only
partially reliant on equipment so a no equipment caster looks remarkably
good against a no equipment rogue, ranger, monk (or even warrior , sk ,
pally)

Pet dammage is less than a 3rd of what a melee will provide.
