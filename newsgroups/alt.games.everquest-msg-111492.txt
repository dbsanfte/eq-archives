well sure if thats how they want to do, every 2-3 years you start over
again and of course buy the game and all its expansions over again,
would be nice if they would say that up front, doesn't sound like alot
of fun for me, you see, I think it would be cool to have characters that
are several years old, thats all.  And I think it would be cool that EQ
lasts for a long time in whatever form instead of fading away cause some
bean counters thought it would be really neat to milk their customers
for every last drop while ignoring the reasons people like to build
their characters.

Some people can't play 8 hours a day, it takes a while to get to the
high level game for many.

EQ community is almost in spite of verant, and of course, disrupting and
spliting the communtity up every few years so they can come out with the
"new" EQ is a great way to help things along.

funny that you write this paragraph after the one above where you
explain "they are a business afterall"

interesting, read back, I was the one who expressed a different point of
view and got flamed.

your little flame too<yawn>
