Let's see... The downtime is mostly scheduled. We know in advance when it 
will happen, and how long it will take. Almost all of unplanned downtime is 
due to the rapid fixing of exploits or bugs. In short, good customer

The whineyness of the crowd that expects 5 9's from a production MMORPG 
network is somehow only overshadowed by the cluelessness of their posts.
