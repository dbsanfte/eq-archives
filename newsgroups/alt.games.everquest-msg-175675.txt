Thanks for the help, advice, and encouragement.  I guess I'm not the
'typical' player in that with the amount of time I get to play I will
more than likely never see lvl50, hah.  I like to solo, I like to
fish, I like to explore, I like to work on my alchohol tolerance...
Not exaclty a leveling machine, but I have fun, and that's what I care
about.  I want to be able to use a 2HB, not all the time, just when I
feel like it, just 'cuz.  Better get back to swinging at Kodiaks with
my stick =)

Thanks again!
