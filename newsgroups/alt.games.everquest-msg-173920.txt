You are presenting two choices but not the *only* two choices.  You're
implying that we are either going to appease the terrorists or kill every
Muslim everywhere.  If you'd really observed our reactions you would notice
that we're taking neither course of action, nor do any but a few extremely
fanatic people advocate the second course of action.  America is attacking
known terrorists and known terrorist supporters.  Muslims for whom we have
no proof of terrorist support are completely left alone.  From the
terrorists' point of view this is a religious war, but that doesn't mean we
look at it that way.  We are *not* engaging in a war against Islam.  We are
engaging in a war against terrorists.

I'm aware that unless we kill every Muslim in the world, indeed unless we
kill every person in the world anywhere, we won't completely eliminate the
threat of terrorism.  But we *can* (and will) contain it without resorting
to genocide.  You are a complete fool if you honestly believe America has
ever considered genocide as a solution to this war.
