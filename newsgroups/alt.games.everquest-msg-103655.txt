There's a simple test to determine if the zone is geared towards druids.

Is it outside?

Barring that, Cobalt Scar has fairly much been paid for by Druids and
Wizards, rarely see anyone else hunting there (maybe for bulthar, occasional
Kelorek'Dar raid, and an epic mage pounding through one of the Otter camps)
and if they are, it doesn't take them long to do something stupid like fear
part of my quad, which means I have to run off and get another wyvern, but
for some reason the other 3 things in the quad don't like somebody fearing
their friend, so by the time I find another wyvern, they've made the idiot
fearer into a slightly warm stain on the ice.  Remember people, if there's 4
thing running around virtually on top of each other, attacking one of them
is going to piss off the other 3, which usually causes DruidLagSyndrome for
yourself, AKA, a slightly reddish smear on the ground.
