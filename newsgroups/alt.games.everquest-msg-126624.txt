Yeah - it's quite easy.  Just open the executable file (eqgame.exe or
everquest.exe (can't remember which - I'm at work right now!)) in Word
or your favourite hex / text editor.  Search for a phrase you know to
be in it ("Wood Elves", "Attaching beards to Dwarves" etc and you
should find all the phrases.

I did this about 6 patches ago, and they were there in plain text. 
Verant could have gotten a bit more sohisticated and
encoded/compressed the strings so they don't show up in plain text.  I
haven't checked it recently.
