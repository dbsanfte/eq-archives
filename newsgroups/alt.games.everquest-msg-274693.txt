Nope, but immersion will include some challenges that some find frustrating.

Yup, you'd have to pass on this invite, and take care to be nearer for your
next planned session.  People played near where they logged out, and it was
a trek when they wanted to change scenery, including both time and risk.

Much like you can't today join friends on another server, you couldn't
then join friends across the world instantly.  Of course, then you had the
option of making the long journey...

It really did feel like a big world, and now it doesn't.

Yay indeed!  That was the cost of travel, and if you're playing with friends,
you probably should have convinced them to join you in your trek so you could
play awhile there rather than you being alone and having to trek back.

It's the requirement of long, dangerous travel that gives the sense of
distance.   If there's a shortcut which many people use, that reduces my
percieved size of the world, even if I don't use it.
