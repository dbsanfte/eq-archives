There's *already* enough to enjoy all the options the
game has to offer.  All that's *required* is one slot.
You're the one who doesn't want to delete the old
character, after all -- you CAN play EVERY race &
class combo if you're willing to do that.   Even better,
you have TWO -- so you can even create a new one
and twink it.  With four you can even do that for each
city...

Yes, I'd prefer more slots.  But the argument you can't
enjoy the full game without them isn't based on any
real requirement...
