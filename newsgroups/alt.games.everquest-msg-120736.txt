Go to groups.google.com and type alt.games.everquest into the search
bar. It will take you to the newsgroup. Google (used to be
www.deja.com) usually has most of the posts.

Keep in mind that the login server gets hammered when the servers come
up (everyone else wants to play just as much as you do). It can
sometimes take a couple of hours to get through, even when all of the
patching is complete. Hang in there.
