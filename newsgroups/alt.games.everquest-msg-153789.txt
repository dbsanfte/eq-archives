I agree it's going to make some changes.  But you're using examples
where VI says it's going to retune the encounters to make them
doable with the changes, so using current needs isn't relevant.

Lower-tier guilds will need more healers and more mages.  Where
they get them is going to be an issue.  And, obviously, how VI
tunes the high-end encounters is going to be an issue as well.
