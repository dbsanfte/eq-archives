Depends on how much it was.  I've seen Dell prices vary by a factor of 3 for
a given system, depending on the route one takes through the site.  They've
always got various specials and rebates going on that, if you can somehow
find out about them, are great.

Generally, I'd go for a 2.4 gig P4, not a 3.06 gig.  The price ratio
between the two is much higher than the clock speed ratio.  By the time
there are games that actually need 3.06 gig, the price will have fallen
enough that simply buying a 3.06 gig and throwing out the 2.4 gig will be
cheaper overall than going with 3.06 gig now.

Also, I'd have gone for a DDR system.  RDRAM has no significant advantage,
and costs a lot more.
