I can hear the famous words for the x-files right now "Trust no one".
You are lucky sir, cause even if someone in a guild gets kicked out...
they still get to keep something really cool that someone gave them
and continue into the game as normal, maybe finding another guild
along the road. Crap I twinked one of my level 10 wizzies with a
froggie robe.... do you seriously think that I could hand that to
someone with a guildtag over level 20?? Didn't think so....

The best way to do it period is to have a friend help you unload your
items, some you CAN trust without a problem, maybe someone IN your
guild. Dont drop items.... I found that in a couple of instances I
droped and item on the ground and couldnt pick it up due to a bug.
They were both items I could obtain again, but if it was something
rare and valuable to you then you never want it to hit the ground.
Nothing more scary than an items being stuck in the ground and 0 gm's
on to help you before it disappears.
