There are a couple of good reasons for this.

1.  Level counts for more than just about anything else when it comes to 
sticking spells, and resisting spells.
2.  Getting AAs at level 60+ is far easier than getting AAs at level 51.

All that being said, if you do spend a lot of time indoors, get at least 
run 1, as it will let you outrun most mobs.
