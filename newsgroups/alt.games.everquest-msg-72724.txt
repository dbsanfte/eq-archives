*chuckle*  Reverting back the the D&D days with my abbrevs.

We were going to roll on the potion, but the warrior didn't want it ( odd, 
eh? He has a level 50 Druid and probably a ton of plat ), and neither did 
the Druid, so I sent a quick tell to the leader saying that I thought it 
would be nice to give it to the cleric that came along for the fun and he 
agreed.  I would have -really- liked it, myself, but I'm sure I'll be back 
for another one =)  My warrior would love to always have one in his 
inventory.  I know the Cazic maze fairly well and with a SoW, could 
probably make the zone alive, even at level 30.

We have 2 rogues in the Guild, level 13 and level 1.  I think we are going 
to go back and try to get some RS armor as guild property to help us get 
one leveled up.
