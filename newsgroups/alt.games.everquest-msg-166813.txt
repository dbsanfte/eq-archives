I have been playing on the Tholuxe Paells server since I started EQ,
and finally decided tonight to create a character on another, less
crowded server.  So, with my shiny new wood elf druid, I immediately
headed to the Bazaar to check out the state of the economy, compared
to my previous experience.  (Not much difference at all, BTW, despite
the population decrease).  So I'm thinking to myself, "OK, got this
new character, new server, no money, ....hmmm."  Search the bazaar for
a couple of minutes, and here is the result, culled from my logfile:

[Tue Dec 03 22:09:14 2002] You say out of character, 'OK, here's the
story...there is an item for sale in bazaar for 100 pp  that NPC
merchants will pay 300 or better for...pst if interested.'

[Tue Dec 03 22:10:50 2002] Mewdem tells you, 'whats the item?'

[Tue Dec 03 22:12:20 2002] You told mewdem, 'here's my problem...I
just created this char and have no cash...if you will buy it and pay
me 100 pp after you sell it, I will tell...I am trusting and counting
on your honesty.'

[Tue Dec 03 22:13:00 2002] Mewdem tells you, 'whats teh item?'

[Tue Dec 03 22:13:25 2002] You told Mewdem, 'Do you agree to the
deal?'

[Tue Dec 03 22:13:52 2002] Mewdem tells you, 'sure, i f I get 300 from
a vendor, I'll pay ya'

[Tue Dec 03 22:14:31 2002] You told Mewdem, 'ok...just a sec'

<at this point, I located the trader who was selling the Deathwatch
Sword for 100, and went to him>

[Tue Dec 03 22:16:13 2002] You told Mewdem, 'Deathwatch Sword'

[Tue Dec 03 22:16:48 2002] Mewdem tells you, 'only one is for sale?'

[Tue Dec 03 22:17:04 2002] You told Mewdem, 'yes...I am standing in
front of the trader'

[Tue Dec 03 22:17:12 2002] Mewdem tells you, 'and you have no money?'

[Tue Dec 03 22:17:27 2002] You told Mewdem, 'correct...I created this
char 15 mins ago'

[Tue Dec 03 22:17:51 2002] Mewdem tells you, 'ok Demidar is my main,
standing next to you'

[Tue Dec 03 22:18:10 2002] You told Mewdem, 'the dwarf'

[Tue Dec 03 22:18:14 2002] Demidar tells you, 'follow me'

<we run to nearest merchant, the one who sells Trader bags>

[Tue Dec 03 22:18:46 2002] Merchant Tekrama says 'Greetings, Demidar.
You look like you could use a Ivory.'

[Tue Dec 03 22:20:14 2002] You told Demidar, 'what's his price?'

[Tue Dec 03 22:20:21 2002] Demidar tells you, '241'

[Tue Dec 03 22:20:34 2002] You told Demidar, 'hey, I'll take the 41
=)'

[Tue Dec 03 22:20:43 2002] Demidar tells you, 'lol ok'

[Tue Dec 03 22:20:50 2002] You told Demidar, 'but with good faction I
have seen 333'

[Tue Dec 03 22:21:10 2002] Demidar tells you, '75 for the fun  hehe'

<he gives me 75 pp>

Woohoo!
