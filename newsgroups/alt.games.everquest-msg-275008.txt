Spawning them in PoK would be great. (I know, non combat zone, but I can
dream).

The skellies last halloween gave me one of the biggest laughs I've had
in EQ. I was sitting at the adventurer's camp in Butcherblock, waiting
for an adventure. Occasionally skeletons would run up and aggro me, but
I was high enough level not to be concerned. Then I saw an elf run out
from the Faydark zone, up to the Soulbinder in the camp and say 'bind my
soul'. At which point a skeleton ran up and killed them in one or two
hits... they were under level 5.
After a little while (slow loader, apparently), they popped back in
front of me, and proceeded to take off running... across the zone, not
back into Faydark. I sent a tell ("I wouldn't hang around in this zone
right now if I were you"). A few minutes later, there they were back in
front of me. And they got one-rounded by a skelly again. They came back,
went off down the path again. A went afk for a while and came back to
see five or so corpses at the soulbinder.
I'm not really one to laugh at others misfortune (footballs to the groin
excepted), but I can only assume they were doing some kind of personal
challenge (why else would a lowbie elf be running across BB? Going
where?), but the sheer speed between "bind my soul" and *SPLAT* was
better than custard pies.
