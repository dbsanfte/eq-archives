"They" is just about every organization that reviews games, Bizbee.  I would
have thought that was obvious.

And I certainly wasn't using that example to bolster my opinions of the
games in question.  I don't feel any need to justify my preferences to
anyone.  After all, I don't think anyone has any stake in which games I
play.

However, if you're looking at a generalized opinion of the game in question,
I figure awards and ratings from organizations that review games would be
quite relevant.  Not to mention the fact that on every gaming messageboard
I've seen, those opinions are fairly universal among the playing public.
Lots of people purchased those games, and lots of people enjoyed them.

I'm curious when you use that reason to cite why Black Isle has been closed
up, why you think your personal opinion is worth a shit to anyone.  People
either buy them or they don't, and it doesn't matter if the games suck in
your opinion.

Reign in that ego, boy.

Again, Interplay's going after the bigger pie of console games, and Black
Isle didn't make console games.  That's why they shut them down, not because
their games suck.
