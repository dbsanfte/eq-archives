Hey all, hope someone can answer this one for me:
I recently started my GB quest. I went to Najena with some guildies that had
completed it before. We were camping the skellies that drop the hilt. After
about 3+ hours and prob close to 30 skellies, no hilt. Plenty of cloth
slippers, bronze daggers and ringmail bracers though. But NO hilt. My 2
guildmates were saying they each picked it up at different times after about
3 skels. Right when we are contemplating this, BAM! Train of The
Widowmistress who aggro'd us. She had some of her brood with her, next thing
I know....
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...

After regrouping, was bound in HighKeep (DOH!), I start asking around of
people who had gotten the hilt. I am told it is a rare drop now, could take
up to 4 hours. MAN! I know quests aren't supposed to be easy and all. But I
already have to hoof it all over Norrath for the other pieces and for a
non-porting class, this chews up a lot of time.

So can anyone verify the rate for the hilt or point me to a source with the
time required to camp this? Thanks in advance for any help.
