Well first off, all melee's can shoot arrows, but the damage is not a lot
and certainly not worthwhile to focus on.
Second, there is a class called Ranger, who has all those components you
describe :)

What do you seek in a magic user?
Healing, "buff" or offensive magic?
Want to play solo or group up?
Want to have a pet tag along?
Want to be able to port all over the world?

As for melee's:
Want to cast a bit of magic anyway?
If so: what kind, healing, offensive or "buffs"?
Do you want to be able to take a few hits or go for the fragile but lethal
damage-outputters like monks and rogues?


The best advise we can give is: Play the game. Make a few characters and see
if you like them.
If you like one, get all the info from the net and have fun!
