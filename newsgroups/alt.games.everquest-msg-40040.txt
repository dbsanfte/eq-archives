This is starting to get a little irritating...  The past several days, I've
been camping the Brewer in BlackBurrow, hoping to get three casks..  I
managed to get two (but from what I'm seeing, that was a complete fluke...
I log in, go to the spawn point, and the Master Brewer is there).

Anyway, for the past several days, I've been waiting for brewers to appear,
and usually just get guardsmen...  Okay, that's just the place holder... but
five times, a Gnoll Brewer appeared..  and all he dropped was a Gnoll Fang,
and a pelt...

Now, according to everything I've seen, in -theory- the Gnoll Brewer should
drop the cask, as well... Not just the Master Brewer (who's even a -rarer-
spawn).  Is this correct?
