The route you're taking will lead to the Outpost in The Overthere. The
outpost is evil-aligned, thus you will be KOS there. Jump off the boat and
swim to the shore after zoning in.

The safest route for neutral and good aligned players is via Butcherblock.
Take the shuttles to the big boat in TD. The boat will dock at Firiona Vie,
a high-elf outpost in Kunark. This will also be the only place you're not
KoS and you can bind here.

Ports are a pain. The "safest" port (Dreadlands) still requires you to run
through a lvl 40 zone with see invis monsters.
