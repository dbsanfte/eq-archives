Here is my question.  I currently have 2 accounts which I 2box quite often
together.  My friend is quitting EQ for good and will be giving my his
account for nothing, as a friend.  I really do not want to pay for 3 monthly
subscriptions thats too much money.  Has anyone ever had a similiar
situation? I would like to transfer his character from his account to one of
my 2 accounts.

TIA, Danny
