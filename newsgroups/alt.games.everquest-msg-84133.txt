Something I read in a game magazine or review on the net kind of
summed up why I never bought DAOC and instead relied on some people
with more cash to waste:

DAOC is evolutionary, not revolutionary.

From what I hear Everquest is a much better fleshed out world with far
more to do. Daoc just eliminates some of the time constraints you have
in EQ but eventually people realize that eliminating those time
constraints in what is otherwise an inferior product is not really a
bonus. They find themselves instead wishing that EQ did things that
way.

Every new MMORPG is going to do stuff the way DAOC does instead of the
way EQ does. They are all going to have far less downtime and
accelerated or even zero corpse retrieval. Because of this leaving EQ
for one particular MMORPG which is one of the first newer ones to do
so is fairly short-sighted. Its only evolutionary and common. Worlds
of Warcraft and even Verant's own Star Wars galaxies are going to have
no corpse retrieval and no large penalty for the most part.
