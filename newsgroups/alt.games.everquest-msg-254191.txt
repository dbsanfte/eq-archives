Behaving like an ass is a great way to get absolutely no help. CS
people love sticking those who act far too aggressively (as you have
described) into a black hole.

Smart people do not follow the advice you just gave. People who never
seem to get out of a speeding ticket follow the advice you just gave.
Smart people realize who actually has the power in the situation and
act *friendly* while still putting their point of view across. A CS
person who has been treated well is a thousand times more likely to go
out of their way to help than one who has been talked down to.

Smart people do not act like you do. You might want to reflect on what
that means.
