There are all sorts of problems. I have not had a specific problem -
but some guildies are complaining of continual lockups when in POK on
Karana.

Talk is of memory leaks which appear to effect people with hardware at
lower end of spectrum.

I have seen recently an alarming number of people embedded in the
scenery.

Personal problems I have been having are getting stuck in scenery (not
in POK though) and even running through tunnel walls and ending up at
evac points ! Especially while in wolf form.

All in all its gone a bit pear shaped for SOE at the moment and I just
hope they get it sorted ASAFP.

So if its any consolation - you are not alone!
