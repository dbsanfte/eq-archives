The interesting question now is going to be how the Sigil vision differs 
from that original EQ vision, and what they've learned from the latter's 
evolution. I have a very high work ethic and I'm not interested in being 
spoon fed, but as much as I loved the world of EverQuest classic, I do not 
have fond memories of the tedium and abuse that I had to endure to get to 
the fun stuff in those early days. Despite several attempts stretching from 
phase one beta to months after release, I was never able to sustain interest 
in any character level beyond 21. I took up crafting and became the first GM 
Jewelcrafter and Blacksmith on my server when it was launched, but my 
character remained a level 8 throughout that experience because I just 
didn't find the adventuring portion of the game worth the hassles. It wasn't 
until many, many changes were made that I finally returned and took my 
character through the end game, into the e-planes, into the PoT and through 
the six Barindu trials into Kod'Taz before I finally left. I agree with most 
of the sentiments that the game has been fundamentally changed and dumbed 
down too far, but I think I've witnessed two swings of the pendulum and 
neither is particularly appealing.

I think Sigil's got what it takes to enforce their vision and stick with it 
(unlike the SWG designers who caved in to public pressure and compromised 
their vision during beta), but I also hope that they've learned some lessons 
from the EQ experience and aren't going to try and recreate 100% of that 
original vision. There's a great reward in store for whoever gets it right.
