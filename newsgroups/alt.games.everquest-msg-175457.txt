Based on EQ, I'd expect the answer is "yes, but".  That is, yes they
will release it that way, but eventually they will bow to player
pressure (aka incessant whining) and either (a) change it so that
"you didn't really blow it, we were just havin' a bit o' fun wit ya",
or (b) add the "everlasting quest of endless timesinks" so that you
can achieve Jedi status anyway.
