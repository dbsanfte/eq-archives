Sidetracking from the jokes:
Someone tried to set a local church on fire last weekend. They caught
it on time and only the altarpiece was damaged, but the son of a
friend of my mother's is a volunteer firefighter and had a brain
hemorrhage while they were there.

I thought torching churches went out of fashion years ago :/ 
(It was a satanist etc. fad of the early 90s here in Norway)
