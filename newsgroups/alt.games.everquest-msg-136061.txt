I think Ghoulbane may have been part of the problem, for some reason
its a very popular paladin weapon (or was at one time) even when
not fighting undead.   Thinking pallies, like other melee, carry a golf
bag full of weapons for different situations, but perhaps the paladins
I was seeing in pickup groups ( guild paladins consistently beat me)
weren't
so clever about such things.

Poor equipment seemed to be a common problem.  Likewise, I found
a significant difference in damage output from my strength, keeping it
up over 200 for melee purposes seemed to add as much as a third to
my crunchiness.  As I progressed past 44 and gradually gave up on
melee, I let my str slide back down, till now its at around 160 unbuffed,
from a fully buffed high end of 250 or so, there is a noticable decline
in damage output.  I often theorized that paladins were for some reason
focussing on their wisdom, dex, stamina, agility... all perhaps fine
paladin attributes, but ones that would cause their melee damage to
suffer.

This seems like a possible explaination, I've never been sure just
why paladins wouldn't at least be able to do same damage with
ease, after all, they should be hitting nearly twice as often (from
dual attack) and with bonus to their attacks that I don't get.  On
the other hand, I did see warriors, monks, rangers all outdamaging
me quite handily, and paladins, using a single weapon with only
dual attack driving up their hit rate, certainly shouldn't have been
the class to break down on message rate.

Hmm, ok, what if -all- classes break down message rate at some
given percentage, and it was only on paladins that that reduced
rate was enough to tip the scale?  I don't see why it would work
that way, mind you, bandwidth would not be the answer when
we are looking at the class with the smallest hit/miss per minute
rate already...

I think you overestimate the competance of the bottom half of the
paladin pool!

On the other hand, I'd not feel terrible about turning in 60% of
a comperably equipped melee's damage rate.  If a mob has
1600 hp, and I'm partnered with a paladin, then we can kill
it in the time he would have taken to kill a 1000 hp mob.  Since
it literally cost me no mana to contribute in this fashion, using
solid Bounce techniques, kills per hour go up by more than half
again what we would have done if I'd been doing strict med-and-heal.
Of course there are other ways a cleric can contribute to killing
mobs faster (nukes) or slow down the damage the MA is taking
to conserve mana... but melee isn't the worst plan in the world.

Its important to note that in addition to the double attack angle,
cleric weapon skill goes up only 4 points per level, while the
paladin's is going up by 5 points per level.  Thus, although I
capped out 2hb at 44, a paladin had several levels earlier reached
and passed that skill point... so a cleric makes a better melee
earlier in his carreer rather than later.  I can tell you that I
always benefited quite handily from wolf form as an attack buff,
while many melee would avoid it as too confusing.  Perhaps
the added attack made up in part for the lower skill.

Its interesting to finally see some doubt cast on this (to me)
long standing mystery, I kept meleeing as long as I was
outdamaging paladins... but I'd thought that point would
come in my 30s, not all the way up at 44!

Course now I still melee, but I'm using a 20/22 weapon
with SCHW and usually SOS... and I'm fully aware that
I'm still probably doing a tenth the damage of any melee
I group with.  It is a fun hobby, though, and heck, with
20/22 how can I -not- feel the old call of a blunt instrument
and a handy kneecap?
