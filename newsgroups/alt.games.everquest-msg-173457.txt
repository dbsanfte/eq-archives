I have heard of variations on that too.

The more points you spend the higher number you may /random.
So for instance the 0 point Raids_once_a_year_dude_01 gets to do /random 0
100 while Uber_raiding_dude_01
has 50 raidpoints to spend and REALLY wants this item so he spends his 50
points getting to roll /random 0 5100, he has a much greater chance of
winning the item but the chance is still there he will roll a 2 and the
other guy wins on a 3 ..
