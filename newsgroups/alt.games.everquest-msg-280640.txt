You hit the nail on the head there!  I'm sure that no-one at Sony
actually *plays* EQ1 these days, otherwise they'd see the myriad
gripes in /OOC and realise all is not well...  It comes to something
when, after about a year (?), you *still* can't read many in-game maps
properly because the command to change the map's background colour got
screwed in a patch, and changes the colour of the map window border
:D  Come on Sony, get a grip!

What am I saying!!!  They'd just try to solve it all with yet another
crap expansion for level 70 to 100 or something.  The idea of actually
making the older levels more interesting, thereby attracting new
players, somehow escapes them.
