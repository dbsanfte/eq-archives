I was wandering around eqatlas checking out dungeons, since I'm still too 
chicken to wander very deep into any of them, when I found Crushbone.  
Since I wanted to go in there again and try my luck, I checked out the 
bestiary on allakhazam and found out D'Vinn was tougher than the Emperor.  
So I started reading the comments people had left, wondering if I could 
take him at 17.  I'm sure some of you have read the comments before, but 
if you haven't, check out the stunning logic of the guy who claims that 
because he couldn't solo 2 slavers, he CAN solo D'Vinn, because D'Vinn is 
"STUPID easy!". :)
