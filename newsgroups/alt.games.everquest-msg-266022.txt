It's not, but I'll bet you a box of Krispy Kremes that on opening day 
they'll have about 25 servers available. They will announce and make 
available the first dozen and monitor to see how these get populated. As and 
if they fill up they'll roll out the rest to keep the load balanced and 
limited. Although you won't see server population numbers at character 
creation, you will see an indication of "Light", "Medium" and "Heavy" load 
on each available server, with the preferred server (probably the least 
populated and one of those marked "Light") pushed to the top of the list as 
the default. That's how I'd do it anyway.
