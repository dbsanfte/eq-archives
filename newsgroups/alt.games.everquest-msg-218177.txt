'Fault' might not be the right word but they (the parents) certainly
bear part of the responsibility for the consequences of their
decision. 

If you roll the dice when you know there's a good chance of a physical
or mental problem due to genetics, you'd better be prepared to deal
with the consequences. of raising a child with such a problem. So
yeah, in those circumstances I do hold the parents more responsible
than anyone (anything) else.
