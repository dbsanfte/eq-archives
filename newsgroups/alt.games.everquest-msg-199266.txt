Valid method.  Heavily luck reliant.

Yes

Listen to it the first time and don't argue.  I have Jboots and pegasus
feather cloak on *every* character I have over level 50 (that's 6 and
counting, including one epic magician).  I have Jboots on *every* character
over level 10. I guarantee both of these methods work, as I have used these
methods to great success.  If it doesn't work for you, you didn't do it
right.  :)


Quillmane: Use a ranger with maxed tracking.  Empty zone helps a *lot* (as
long as people are only at spires and treehouse it's still possible).  Track
and kill *one* escaped splitpaw gnoll.  *ONE*.  ONLY ONE.  Now track, sort
"normal".  Kill the next thing that pops.  Repeat.  The respawn time is
*fast* and even with maxed tracking you'll have to move around a bit to be
sure to catch the next spawn.  Spawn locations are basically in a triangle
formed by the spires, the treehouse and the hermit, but on the edges of the
triangle, not the points.

AC: Kill the undead in the tower between 7 pm and 8 pm game time.  Wait. 
Yes, that is *all* that is required.  You can help it along by making sure
SGs and "minor named" (an asp, a mummy, etc.) are kept dead, as they take up
the same spawn spots as the AC, but I don't actually think that's necessary. 
I usually do it anyway out of boredom.
