My, thats a pretty absolute statement.

Allow me to prove it wrong.

I don't do that.   Even in a pickup group, I don't claim NBG when it's not
an upgrade or something I would use.

If you wanted to say that there was a chance of it happening, I would agree
completely.   If you said there was a good chance even, it wouldn't be worth
arguing about.   But I guess those are the chances you take.

Because they didn't want to wait on a 3 hour list to get into the one camp
where shaman loot drops?

Because they would rather be getting experience than sitting around forever
making sure they dont' get screwed out of thier 1 in 100 shot of getting a
shaman loot item from a specific place?
