As I said, I haven't played for a long time.  A year or two, I think.  
Have they added something to massively increase mana regen rates?  Back 
when I played, the best you could do as a casual player was KEI and 
maybe one or two FT1 items.

Without KEI, after a normal fight, it took about 10 minutes to get mana 
back.
