Here's a little known tip as an alternate way to create HOtkeys
The /ho command.

Syntax:

/ho <hotkey name> <action>

Example:
Agranon is your main assist.  To make an assist hotkey I do the following:
/ho assist /assist Agranon

A hot key pops on your cursor and you can place it where you want.  Similar
to DAOC.
