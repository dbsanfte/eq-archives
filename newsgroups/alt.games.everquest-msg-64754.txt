Sony's patcher doesn't go out and send the files to *everyone*.
That's why usenet is a horrible file distribution medium.  It's a
broadcast medium with semi-persistant storage, so it is doubly bad for
file distribution, because first you waste a lot of bandwidth for
people who don't want or need the files, and second you take up a lot
of space on news spools until the files expire.

Usenet is, however, an excellent way to tell people about files you've
made available via FTP or the web or some other similar direct
distribution method.
