It's not needed. You can already compare weapons accurately via damage/delay
ratio, and then add on top any attribute adjusters (which are not directly
linked to the weapons performance - for example, if it adds 10 to STR but
you are already at the cap, it's effectively worthless)

The only unknown is the proc rate.

Bottom line is if an item that you want is up for sale at a price you are
willing to pay, then it's worth that price. YOU may not think the fungi is
worth 120k, but the guy who wants it to reduce the downtime for his twink
might.
