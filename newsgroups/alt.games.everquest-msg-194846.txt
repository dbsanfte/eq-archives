This is from a post on my guild's message board, most of the speeds based on
various sources. I don't know how accurate it is...


 So you want to move, well here's what moves you faster.

Note on Selo's: Bard songs are greatly improved by the use of even a basic
instrument. At level 6 my friend's Bard with the normal cheap drum can
outrun my level 17 Shaman with SoW

Also note that horses accelerate, whereas Selo's with the best drum gets you
to speed almost instantly...
