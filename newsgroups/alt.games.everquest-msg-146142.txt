 I have petitioned 3 times and used the online email customer support
attempting to get my gear back. I have been contacted by Guides twice
who said a GM would be with me shortly. After both of those contacts I
waited 4 to 5 hours ( I have 2 accounts and 2 computers so it made the
wait easier )  and a GM never showed up.

This is the first time in 2 years I have needed a GM for something of
this nature. I'm beginning to understand why they have so many
complaints about customer support.

I still dont have my gear back and it's very frustrating.
