Try this.

Go to Great Divide.  Find a nice spot on the edge with little in the way
of roamers.  Move in a bit till you find a giant.  Flash him, and run
back to your pull spot.  Wait for flash to wear off, won't be long.
Start mashing your nuke button till he gets in range for it to start cast.
Once it goes off, quickly hit flash again, and watch which way he
moves.  If its not towards you, its all good.  Repeat.  Watch his HP
and your mana bar.  If your mana bar is moving down slower than
his HP bar, then you are golden.  If not, then run away while he's
flashed, or if you are a distance from a zone line, use root instead
of flash next time he comes for you.

I call this tactic Flashdance.

Works in lots of places, I just developed it in GD so thats my
best example.

It allowed me to solo mobs without benefit of SOW/tboots, and
further to solo higher HP mobs than I could with root... which
breaks with almost every nuke, so you also need to cast one
root per nuke, at significantly higher mana cost.  Flash of light
casts quicker and costs less mana, and is resisted less often.
This tactic is still not for the faint of heart, of course, and sadly
becomes harder and harder to use as the cast time on your
nukes becomes longer... you need to be able to nuke -and- flash
both between the time it takes your target to first enter nuke
range and the time he reaches "pound on you" range.  While
it still works if he's pounding on you (if you remember to back
up after) you take some damage, which means you have to
consider wasting mana healing yourself.  On a snared mob this
tactic is unstoppable.  On the other hand, you could use Fear
on a snared mob to good effect, while Fear is impractical
for flashdance style fighting since the POINT is the short duration
of the blind effect, which allows your mob to run away but
not out of follow range, and return as your nuke has cycled
again.

Another drawback of the tactic is that you need a good open
space for it, since your mob  is running off unsnared, he may
find friends to bring back otherwise.

SO use with caution, but enjoy, I sure liked having something
utterly different to do, and I always like figuring out uses
for the non-heal spells in my book, there seem to be tons of the
things.
