Elemental planes raiding ranger. ATK is not yet capped, although is close.
When using archery I equip swiftwind, which adds 30ATK. If you're at 250 ATK
without your epic you are , pretty much, extreme endgame. Its only going to
happen with *massive* farming of VT (which pretty much doesnt happen any more),
or elemental planes parts.

Rangers are the expection, true, but they fit neatly into what Lance was
discussing; the effect is useful right up at the top end, and the ratio
doesnt hamstring you because you're using a bow.

I believe there are 36% LDON augments. *anyone* should be able to cap haste
now.
