I think that makes more sense.  Sometimes in Hate for example,
I've seen our monk have to /q when FD....but a few months ago
mobs started hanging around a _bit_ longer where he'd quit...they
didn't do silly things like aggro folks outside of their radius or
anything like that, they just didn't return to their normal spots as
quickly.

Gorenaire seems to be doing the same thing.  Last night on
E. Marr I got blasted by her (thank Bristlebane for a fast
horsie), ran through the tunnel and camped out.  She stayed
around the DL end of the tunnel for about 10 minutes (to
which I apologized to the zone for when I came back), without
trying to wander away.  I KNOW I wasn't on the hate list anymore,
because she didn't eventually warp on top of me, but she did
"seem" to be "agitated" a bit longer than normal with a supposedly
empty hate list.

Just anecdotal, to be sure, but something I'd noticed more
than once in some higher level mobs.
