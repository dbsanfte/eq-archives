Camo allows me to go in and scout out the area without being aggroed
by wandering mobs (deepwater barracuda in this case). Not usually
necessary, but I prefer to be paranoid.

Levitate is used if I get into too much trouble. Pop to the surface
and run to the shore. I outdistance the mobs, they lose interest and
go home.

Interesting. I read a dozen posts on boards trying to figure out how
to do it "correctly". Only one mentioned ensnare. The rest said to get
them out of the water FAST then worry about ensnare. This might be
because of the wandering barracuda that make long pulls impractical.

The flame lick technique is new to me; one bloodgill expert
recommended it highly.

Trust me, I can't wait.

When I first got the DS, I read that it "reflected damage". I took
that to mean if the mob did x pts of damage and you had a 20 pt DS,
you would take (x-20) dmg and the mob would take 20 dmg. I gather it
means you take x dmg and the mob takes 20 dmg?

If so, it means I'll need one less LS to kill most of the quad. Still
useful, but nowhere near what I thought it was.

>Using my technique, I'm full health when I'm done. :(

Everything I've read says you WILL take damage when you hunt
bloodgills and you NEED chloroplast up because of this.

So far I have quadded snow cougars, dire wolves, hornets and ulthorks.
I am (almost always) at full health when I'm done them and I've never
needed chloroplast. Bloodgills are a very different story entirely.

Karana. I might have been unconscious when I was hit, not sure.
