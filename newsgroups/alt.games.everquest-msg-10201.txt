I'd encourage anyone who wants the interface enhancements to get
Velious.  Some parts of it don't require large high level groups.  I
haven't seen very much of Velious yet, but my 35 druid and my friend's
28 wizard actually managed to get some experience in a group of two
running around Iceclad.  And I saw a level 26 looking for a group in
Iceclad the other week.  

As for EQMacros, since Verant added the additional hotkeys and such a
while back, I doubt EQMacros has much to offer unless you are disabled
and unable to manage some of the rapid mouse movements or key
sequences.  I had heard that voice recognition software can be used with
EQ to control some things, that might be more useful.
