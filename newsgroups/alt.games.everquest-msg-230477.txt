I was highly pissed when I found out about it. He sold the boards
Sunday apparantly...and didn't bother to tell us until one of the mods
made mention of it and some grumbling started coming up that he
couldn't delete fast enough on Tuesday.

I understand running such a site gets expensive. I understand he may
have felt that he was making a good decision. But I'm pissed that he
didn't come to US (the forum posters) and tell us that he was having
so much trouble covering running costs. He dropped a few ads at the
bottom of the page a month ago, and was quiet after that. Most of us
probably figured he was getting enough donations combined with the ads
to cover costs. If he'd ASKED for help, I'd wager he would have gotten
more donations.

But, no, Yantis offered the big check and he bit. So, I left the
forum.
