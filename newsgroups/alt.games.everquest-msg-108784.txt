Indoors (not necessarily all dungeons) Druids loose the ability to cast SoW,
Treeform, Wolfform and one line of AE nuke (rain, I think, not too sure).
Not much, but it might make a difference to your play-style.

Unfortunately, Indoor Dungeons are usually the areas with the worst
'pathing' (the route a pet will take to follow you) so Mages are almost as
bad Indoors as Druids are.

A Necro would be slightly better choice than Mage (but you can't really
fear-kite in a confined area) because they are slightly less reliant on
their pet...

You might want to try a Monk... FD, Mend and Regen (Iksar or Item) will get
you out of most tight spots when you're in too deep and the exit's just too
many corners away.
