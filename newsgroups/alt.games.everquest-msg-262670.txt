My iksar monk was born with kunark and did a lot of time fighting goblins as
a matter of course. As he was poor (i started with a completely new
character and there wasn't really a market on kunark, no bazaar, no porting
over to east commons for a trade by torchlight) he didn't levbel very
quickly and as i was and remain a time limited player, i soloed a lot back
in the days a monk could without uber gear.

I fought bandits, sarnak, giants and unexplained (half?) elf druids that
hand out near one of the zonelines rooting and zapping me if i was unlucky,
in addition to goblins and i never consciously worked my faction up until
fairly late, and even then i'd just chuck a shuriken at a goblin someone
else was fighting. Eventually i sneaked my way to FV (scary trip) and i was
dubious, which is all i needed. Alas there's a halfling on PoG faction,
which can't be improved, and that was a problem, but at least i had a boat
to kaladim.

Getting faction there was easy, lots of people killing mobs, lots of
opportunies for a thrown shuriken faction hit. If i was a necro it would
have been even easier.. i think originally you could set a pet to kill
anything that came nearby, which was a big problem if a friendly guard
wandered past. I ended up ally, then there was a patch, and my max faction
with the wood elves and dwarves was set to warmly. :P

Mind you i still couldn't use the banker in kelethin, and the rogues of
kaladim were tedious and even dangerous to improve (2 camps of backstabbing
bastards), so i let it go, and went back to xp'ing. I don't recall arboreals
back then, maybe they were there, but without track it would have been
painful to find them for the faction hit with the banker.
