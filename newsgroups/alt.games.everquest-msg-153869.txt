SK's have more HP, more AC, better mitigation, snare (to get some distance
on a mob, make many splits extremely trivial), but at 60 they also get TWO
fd's they can use.

FD failed/seen through?  np,  the SK has death peace and can instantly FD
again

Even with rapid feign 3 (3 x class ability points) the SK can FD twice
faster than a monk can
