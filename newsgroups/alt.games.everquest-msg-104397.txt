Well, at least most classes do.  Bards only whine about how underpowered 
we are to keep the nerfs at bay.  If we stop whining, someone at Verant 
will wonder what is wrong, actually play a bard for a day or two, and then 
*WHAMMO!*, whacked with the nerfbat.
OK, we do whine about our songs alwasy being broken, but that's a 
legitimate bitch.
