Well, first you have to get to know the area.  While learning the area,
root/snare/dot.  I'd suggest any open space just so it's easier to see
what's coming.

Once you get to know the area you'll probably be level 49.  Since there's
not a LOT of casters around, quad kiting is a real option with Fire.

But you're right, there's not a big difference between the walls and in the
open.  If you're just passing through, though, it's a safe zone to sow/lev
through, even if you don't feel like going invis.
