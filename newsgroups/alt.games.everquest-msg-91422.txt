Well I guess I was under the wrong impression then...  I had the impression
that it was all about uber loot and being spoon fed monsters and quests...

As for AD&D and Hardcore Gamers...  I remember the good old days when you
got a +1 Sword at level 10 and you were ROCKIN'...  Then again, I'm old
school tournament rules kind of AD&D, not the Monty Haul crap that the game
became to most...
