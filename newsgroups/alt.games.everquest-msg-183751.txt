From being powerlevelled? How so? They mow through mobs at breakneck 
speed, therefore they are hit far fewer times, therefore they have far 
fewer opportunities for defensive skillups.

But to "do it right" would slow down the whole PL process to the point 
that it is not powerlevelling in the sense to which I was referring. I 
can understand getting a little help along the way, but I meant giving a 
level 1 character uber gear, uber weapons, throw on a nasty DS and regen 
and throw them into a zone with mobs even or higher level.

You have to hit a mob x number of times in your character's life to get 
to a particular weapons skill level.
You have to be hit by a mob x number of times in your character's life to 
get to a particular defensive skill level.
You have to cast the appropriate spells x number of times to get to a 
particular casting or channelling skill level.

These things just can't happen outside of a more natural approach.
