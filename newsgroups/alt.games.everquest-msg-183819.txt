On CT, 50 plat is pretty much the "standard donation", or so I'm told by
the other casters I know. Not being rich, I usually do without, but a cleric
with a horse can usually manage that.

Do not bind the mouths of the kine etc - it can be gotten cheaper, but there
is not always a swarm of 60 chanters competing for my cash.

Personally I don't usually get KEI for exp groups and don't expect others to
do so either. I find it annoying when people leave the group for 20 minutes
to refresh their KEI. I *do* get it for soloing, because when I solo the
mix of spells I use is vastly different to what I use when grouped.

In any case, 20 plat or 50, it's still a cost to be borne. If the druid is
*expected* to have KEI just as the cleric is *expected* to use peridots
for buffs, and the KEI is contributing to group throughput (just as Symbol
cuts downtime due to the cleric medding)... compensating the druid (or
wizard, or whatever) seems reasonable to me.

But I don't *expect* a druid to turn up with KEI. I don't expect *anybody*
to turn up with a KEI. It costs too blinkin' much, you can be sure
*somebody* will want to pike out for a refresh at some point, and an ability
to manage without it suggests that the person using it knows their class.

I didn't think we were arguing cicularly yet. Actually it looks like we
agree on a lot of things. The main point of contention seems to be
whether *expecting* KEI is reasonable, which is largely a matter of opinion.

Because you're benefiting from their higher DPS?

Anyway, I'm not claiming that *only* casters should be compensated for C3.
If a hybrid has it, that's good too, and they should also be compensated.

*BUT* if loot from the camp won't support it... I'm not going to suggest
that anybody "should" have KEI. At that point it's a balance between
experience and loot/cash. Up to the individual. Personally I would say
not to bother, but then I have peridots eroding my reserves too.

In some ways I prefer casters not to have C3. It means they won't be
leaving for a refresh, and suggests they actually know their class.

OK, fair enough; I was looking at it as "KEI for casters", not "KEI for
hybrids". For a hybrid, zero medding time explodes the usefulness of KEI
out of all proportion. For a caster, it improves net mana regen by maybe
50%, which is major but not as spectacular as for a hybrid who never meds.

I once suggested a long-term HP regen buff as roughly equivalent to
"KEI for melees" once but was pretty much shouted down as it not being
good enough. It's not as good as KEI for a caster, but it's *something*.

I was going to agree with this (i.e. that the better buff was vastly better)
until I actually sat down and worked out some numbers. Basically with
relatively low DPS the chanter is better off with the worse buff, if you
compare mana spent vs. a nuke. So mana-wise, there is a window where the
worse haste may be preferable. (Damage over half an hour is enhanced by
about 900HP for each 10DPS of the melee, for a cost of around 300 mana
as I recall, so your melee DPS has to be pretty bad for it to *not* be
worthwhile. However, the chanter will usually not be nuking, and the
melees will not always be fighting, which skews things a bit.)

With higher DPS (and it doesn't take much to get high enough) you *are*
better off with the better haste... assuming that the chanter has the mana
to spare, since medding downtime = zero DPS however you cut it.

By the low 40s I would expect melee DPS to be high enough that it would be
a no-brainer. Actually by the numbers the better haste is probably
preferable
over the whole range where the two haste spells are available.

Note that these numbers support *your* argument. But my argument is only
that KEI is good, but by no means essential, and as it adds to the resources
of the group should be compensated in part.
