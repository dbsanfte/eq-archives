Here is the crucial evidence.

Monks have fewer HP than warriors, according to you.

You can't spot the difference in observing the fight, you say here.

Why not?  Because monks have fewer HP but take less damage,
so their bars move at the same rate.

With CHeal in its current state, a monk MA with clerics healing
him is not advantaged by this fact.  CHeal heals all the damage
