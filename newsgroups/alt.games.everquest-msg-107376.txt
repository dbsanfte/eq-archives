Having gotten all my lvl 29 spells, I'm looking them over to see what
fits where in my various spell lineups. One of the things I was most
looking forward to was improving my ability to quad kite once I had
Bonds of Force. (Great spell, by the way.)  But to go along with the
ability to snare four mobs, I had somehow stupidly assumed that my new
AoE spells would also be an upgrade. Unless I'm missing something, I
just got royally hosed.

I received two new AoE damage spells: Energy Storm and Shock Spiral of
Al'Kabor. Now, I've already asked on Graffe's and some of the wiser
heads there refer to the whole line of spells including the latter, as
the "Al'CrapBor" line of spells. Allegedly they can hit five mobs
instead of four. Oh, me oh my. Big freaking whoop. I can ONLY SNARE FOUR
of them, assholes! Why on Norrath would I have any need to nuke five?
And, to top it all off, it does significantly *LESS* damage than my
level 24 Column of Lightning, while costing significantly *MORE* mana. 

The explanation of Energy Storm is a bit more sketchy. At first, it
appears to do a LOT less damage. (Like 92 max to four targets.) But the
explanation is that it comes in 3 waves, so it's actually a DoT.
(errr... sort of.) But as an AoE I'm just wondering... does it "follow"
the target? Because if I'm going to cast this, I'm going to be jogging
along with several angry mobs behind me. If it's really going to "follow
the mob" in it's travels, then I guess it's ok. I could see it being the
first thing I cast, then follow up with CoL a couple times while the
first one keeps hammering away. But if it's "area" of effect is the same
spot, then it's going to be raingin damage down on empty grass. (Or
worse, potential unsnared adds).

So, can anyone enlighten me on the usefulness (or lack thereof) of these
new spells?
