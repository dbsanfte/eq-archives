That should depend on how plentiful your supply and theirs is, and if the
consumer is price-sensitive.  If you and they have plenty, and the consumer
is not price-sensitive, than going to 900 isn't that wise.  A RL example of
an item like this is cigarettes.  Consumers don't really care much about
cigarette prices, and they don't have much brand loyalty, so if one company
sells lower, consumers switch to them, and everyone else lowers to match.
Net result: everyone gets about the same sales they would have had before,
but at a lower price!  So, cigarette companies avoid competing on price.

For other items, though, especially if you don't plan to leave a trader up
all the time, and there aren't a lot of buyers, undercutting those 1000 plat
sellers makes a lot of sense.
