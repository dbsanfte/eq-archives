True, but it's even better than that.  Either by design or accident, there's
a really great feature in the "spellset" code.

For example, set up your spell gems like this:

	Gem 1:  Unmemmed
	Gem 2:  Unmemmed
	Gem 3:  Unmemmed
	Gem 4:  Unmemmed
	Gem 5:  Stun
	Gem 6:  Greater Healing
	Gem 7:  Cure Disease
	Gem 8:  Gate

Now save that as "SpellsetFred" or whatever.  Later, when you've
got 8 other spells memmed, if you load SpellsetFred, it'll re-mem
*only* spellgems 5-8, and leave whatever spells you've got in
gems 1-4 *completely alone*.

In other words, the spellsets aren't an "all or nothing" thing,
you can have spellsets that only define spells for certain slots,
and leave other slots untouched.
