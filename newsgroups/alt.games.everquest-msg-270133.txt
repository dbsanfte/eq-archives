   A noble sentiment, but have you considered the possible repercussions? 
If these people weren't whining on the internet/usenet, then they would
have to take their whining to the real world.  Given the sheer number of
whiners this medium supports, I think that this would dramatically increase
the amount of whining we all would have to actually listen to without
having the benefits of a lightning fast index finger on the "next" button.

   Something to keep in mind, I think.
