If you guys use the same Ration Packs we use here is Australia then just
remember Ration pack C has the opposite effect. These of course are in
demand and hard to get hold off, so you learn to mix and match a bit. The
main thing to remember that the "survival" type biscuits are the main
offender, so you only eat these when needed, but remember, in the field it
is better to be umm...  "clogged" than err... "freeflowing" so to speak.

Long deployments they tend to setup messes unless your highly mobile so it
is only when you "go bush" that there is a noticable absence of anything to
hit the fan with.
