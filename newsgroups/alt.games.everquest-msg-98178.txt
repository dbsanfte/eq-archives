Hey!  I actually tried to get into that place.  I grew up in Fontana,
California, half an hour or so up the road.  Believe it or not, my high
school principal took me there in her car to interview.  My SAT scores were
in the ballpark, but my GPA wasn't.  I hated homework and refused to do it,
so I got anywhere from A to F, depending how much emphasis the teacher put
on homework over tests.

I guess that homework thing will turn out to have a significant impact on
the entire rest of my life.
