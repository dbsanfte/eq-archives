No it does what was said above, changes the different screen modes. It will
drop back to 640x480 in Windowed mode if the setting "keep same resolution"
is OFF. The default res is 640x480 most people use 1024x768 (or above) for
the transparent view so the windows don't overlap each other.
If the setting is ON then Windowed view will be reduced in size to
accomodate the higher resolution.
