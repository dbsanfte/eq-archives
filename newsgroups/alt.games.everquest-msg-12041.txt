First, if you're not a twink, plan on being broke for a long time ;-)

You can sell stacks of bat wings and bone chips for about 3pp each.
The various bards mail quests pays 1-5gp.  (The shortest one I know is
Felwithe to Kelethin)
If you're near everforst, you can kill polar bear cubs. The rare drop HQ
bear pelts for 10pp (because of the nerf--might get more)
LQ, MQ, and HQ wolf pelts.  Anywhere from 5gp to 2pp each I have paid.
Around level 10 you can kill bandits in the Karanas and turn in the sashes
in Qeynos. (guessing 1-3 plat per kill counting loot and quest reward)
Around level 10 you can kill will-o-wisps.  common drop burned out
lightstone = worthless.  uncommon drop lightstone (1pp at merchants)
uncommon drop greater lightstone = 7pp sell to players or do the quest
(which is why people buy them) for 8-9pp and big xp.
