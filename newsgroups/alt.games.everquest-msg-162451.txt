*shrug* I was going with Dennis' numbers (the 5 minutes), my Druid
isn't high enough to try quadding yet.  And if it takes you longer
than 5 minutes, plus another 10+ to med full, it doesn't sound like
you're getting much of an advantage, if any, over rotting.  I will
say that when I've watched quadders at work it sure didn't seem to
take more than 2 or 3 minutes tops.

I can't imagine rooting mobs to shoot them when you've got room
enough to Snare kite.  And when I tried root shooting, about three
years ago, it appeared to me that bowshots were breaking my roots
so I gave it up after a series of uniformly disappointing trials.
All breaking root on bowshots does is to further restrict the
places where a Ranger could solo successfully, I don't see how it
has anything to do with Archery damage being overpowered, if in
fact said damage is overpowered.  Why target Ranger soloing at all?
The whole thing reeks of an ego trip by a designer who's finally
in a position of authority he's lusted after for years.  If Archery
damage is the problem then fix that, this archery/root thing feels
mean-spirited and vindictive.

Oh, and my highest two characters are both Paladins, so my solo
"pattern" typicly involves using most of a bar of mana in order
to survive killing a single low blue and then having a fairly
long recovery time before the next fight.  I could go back to
LGuk and kill faster/easier I suppose, but the risk of death due
to boredom would likely outweigh the increase in xp gained.  I
point this out because it's at the root of my siding with the
Rangers here, melee soloing is so damned situational that it
irritates me to see them effectively restricting it further for
any of us.  Their time would be better spent coming up with ways
to allow Warriors and Rogues to solo, and restore to Monks the
ability to solo, without throwing things out of whack.  Instead
they're gonna go dump on a hybrid because some developer doesn't
like a feature that's totally unrelated to what's being weakened.
