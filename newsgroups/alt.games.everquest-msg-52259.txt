It may be worthless to you, but it isn't valueless in the context of
reality. Expensive photographic equipment has a resale value. You may not
want it but many people will pay good money for it second hand. That's what
I meant.

Yes. Like the $9.89 I pay per month to play EQ, for instance.

Your analogy doesn't match the situation of paying real money for virtual
PP, I think. I'm trying to come up with another analogy where someone sells
you some titanium ear-trumpets so 'you can enjoy your time more', but it's
getting a little stretched ;p

No you misunderstand. If you enjoy playing the game, and buy items for RL
money, and get found out, you will be banned. Then you won't be able to
enjoy it at all.

I'm not. I don't believe the selling of equipment has any real bearing on
the enjoyment of the playerbase in general, any more than twinking does.
This does not, however, change my opinion of those who do it.

You seem awfully hung up on the choice of 'idiot' as a term for the people
who buy in game artifacts for RL money. This is not really the argument I
want to have. I disagree with the practice, and have a low opinion of those
eho do it for the reasons I outlined in my other posts. I choose to call
these people idiots. Would you prefer I referred to them as 'gay' or 'lame'
or 'sux0rz' or 'gimps'? Please take your pick so we can get back to debating
the merits of the practice, not the semantics of my condemnation thereof.

When the author wrote the book, it was intended to be read in a certain
order, denoted by the numbering of pages and the sequential arrangement of
chapters. By reading the last chapter first you prejudice your enjoyment of
the preceding material.
Similarly with games and god modes.
Similarly with EQ and pp/items bought before you can earn them through
in-game means.
Now it may make me a purist or something, but I just don't subscribe to this
way of thinking. When I appraoch any of the above forms of entertainment,
first and foremost I try to enjoy the material as it was intended to be
presented by its creator or creators.
Second time around, sure, I'll skim, cheat, toy with the form, all of these
things, in order to wring more enjoyment from them.
To me, buying ingame property for RL money is to do the latter before the
former, and I find that mystifying. So I lump all the poeple that do such
things together and refer to them by a suitably derogatory name. That's
human nature.

The public-subscription, mass-gaming scenarios I've been involved in
(MMORPGs as a player, PBM games as a player and moderator) go to great
lengths to make their games fair for players of different economic
backgrounds. Such as limiting the number of player-positions allowed, or
charging flat-rate sunscription fees. The eBay phenomenon destroys this and
allows those with spare cash to gain advantage over those who don't.
That annoys me.

  What position?  EQ isn't a competition between the

I'd go as far as to say the majority of players see it this way.

 If this game, to

This is all personal, that's why my first post ended with IMHO.
The game is designed around equipment being of varying rarity, hence rare
spawns and rare drops. The equipment you own _is_ supposed to differentiate
you from the crowd because there is no other way of gaining such distinction
in EQ.
To then gain said equipment through RL means cheapens the equipment.
Now to illustrate. When my warrior first got his Dragon Haste Cloak, I was
thrilled. I had waited my entire career (approx 2 years at the time) to own
such an item. The fight in which I gained it was immensely enjoyable, as we
had a somewhat underpowered force yet still prevailed. I remember the day
clearly. I have screenshots that I treasure, and can remember the names of
all that were there that day. I _still_ enjoy this item, and these memories,
every time I look at the cloak.
Now, go an buy the same cloak for 300 bucks off eBay. Go and enjoy
slaughtering orcs like a lunatic. But in 6 months time what enjoyment will
that cloak bring you? None. You will have forgotten about it, or traded it
for some other piece of phat lewt you couldn't otherwise obtain.
This is the difference in enjoyment levels as I see it. I cannot understand
anyone who would do the latter when instead, with patience, they could do it
the way I did, with all the rest of the fun I had on that 2 year journey to
my haste cloak. I find it so baffling it makes me question their mental
capabilites.

Look at the history of the game and it is obvious the designers were
frighteningly naiive about how the playing populace would behave :)

I go further and say 'Play to the spirit of the rules, not the letter'. If
you need to refer to the written rules as laid out by VI to guide your
behaviour, you're all ready screwed. IMHO again.

> However, many people do not agree with the rules

Then they shouldn't play. To disregard rules you don't agree with when those
rules are there for the benefit of a wider population is incredibly immature
IMHO.

Hehe well it isn't beneath me :) I have a lot of opinions and I distribute
them freely. Some of those opinions are probably unreasonable. But a lot of
people and a lot of life is unreasonable too :)
As I've tried to show, there is a basis for the argument. It may or may not
withstand close, impartial, logical scrutiny. It matter not at all to me one
way or the other though :)

Well I'm calling on my understanding of people in general here, and the 'way
of things'. Something given to you has less 'personal value' than something
earned. Sure, getting what you want when you want it provides short term
satisfaction. But not long-term. This goes all the way through human
behaviour. Did you get what you wanted all the time when you were child or
did your parents make you work for/earn things? If both, which did you
treasure most?
At the heart of the matter we may even be arguing about the difference
between a spoiled child who got their way all the time, and someone brought
up to realise that some things in life have to be earned, or waited for, and
are worth the wait. The two sides of this argument certainly have parellels
with that :)

Sure. As have many insults and other words in common usage. In this case it
is somewhat justified. I cannot understand the mentality of people who
choose to 'not play the game' as Lokari put it, but to buy their way through
it. So therefore I must call into question their mental processes and
prowess. So I call them idiots. It may not be the most accurate or suitable
term but it provides appropriate denigration for my tastes.

However, what I find ironic is when I observe a debate as a

Generally, but not exclusively, eh? :P

We're talking of opinions here. Not trying to debate our way to a clear
understanding of some cosmic truth for the enrichment of mankind.

So in summary, if you cheat at videogames before playing them through as
intended, or read the last chapter of a book before glancing at any other
single word of it, or, basically, cheat your way through leisre experiences
in ways other than those that were designed, I, Lokari, and several other
regulars here, consider you to be an idiot. And probably lame, gay and a
sux0r too. Take yer pick :)
