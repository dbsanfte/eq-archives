The GMs aren't handing out the bags, you'll have to wait for the bug
to be fixed. The bags aren't being handed out via GM because of the
chance of people being able to /claim when the bug is fixed after
having a bag given by the GMs, thus ending up with 2 bags for 1
account.

The "GM" in chat that told you that was more likely a guide and
mis-informed.
