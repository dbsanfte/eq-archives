Rangers cannot track their own corpses.

Rangers can have the possibility to track the corpse of others but only
under the follow strick conditions:
    1. Ranger must be grouped with the person prior to the person
dieing.
    2. Ranger must be in the zone that the person died in prior to the
death occurring.
    3. The person must be bound in another zone.
    4. The person cannot re-enter the zone while the ranger is tracking
their corpse.
    5. The ranger must stay in the zone until he/she is done tracking
the corpse.
    6. The ranger must stay logged in and cannot go LD until he/she is
done tracking the corpse.

Failure to follow any of these conditions will cause the ranger to
either not be able to track or will lose track prior to finding the
corpse.
