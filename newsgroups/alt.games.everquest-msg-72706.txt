Thanks for this.  It kind of gives me an idea of what I might be
looking at when I max everything out.  My MB will take 768MB and I am
using a VisionTek Xtacy 5564 64m GeForce2 MX400.  Processor is an AMD
K7-550 on a board (MSI MS6167 v1) that will handle up to a 1gig Athlon
chip.  

Sounds like I will likely be able to expect about what you are
getting.

Thanks
