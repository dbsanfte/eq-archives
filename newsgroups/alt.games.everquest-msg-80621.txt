As a Druid, I'm often given the choice of the loot in a game...
One recent grouping landed me a couple of quest items, magical buffing items
and gems... Yeah, I mentioned I was a jeweler (sp?) then all of the sudden,
everyone was giving me gems... great! :)  Well I DO my Druid duties well and
like to be compensated.  I also expect that I will get some of the good
stuff.
