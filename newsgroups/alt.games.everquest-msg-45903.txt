Um...I was thinking we were talking about going LD while fighting...

And doing so, agroing every mob on your path and training them on other
group. Perhaps someone will suggest that LD pc shout 'TRAIN' while running
for the zone...

 Anyway, if you go LD in a fight, it is better that you stay where you are.
Would you die, your team mate could get your corpse and rez you easyly. Even
if your group suffer a wipe out, the CR would be easier if all corpse are on
the same spot.
