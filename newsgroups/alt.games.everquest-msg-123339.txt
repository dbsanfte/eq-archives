While the massive "hey who put the brakes on" effect of S(L)OW
is a shocker, 90% of the time I will keep it on, selos is a rocket but
it costs a twist slot to keep it running, and doesn't work indoors.
If I'm travelling long distance (say HHK to Qeynos) I'll sure kill
SOW but assuming I'm headed for a hunting grounds I'm actually
happy to get the buff, having "faster than the mobs" always on means
I can do a third more "happy fun time" bard songs in a fight.  Just don't
make the mistake I did recently of taking selo's out of the song lineup...
mob snared or rooted or dispelled me (wasn't paying attention when
it happened) and a little while later when I needed to back off I suddenly
figured out I was at "slower than mobs" speed and no way to change
that cause I sure couldn't sit to mem!

Also unwanted for my bard are heals.  I know you think you are
being nice... but if I'm not in a fight and I'm under 50% health,
I'm happily working on bind wounds.  If I'm not in a fight and I'm
over 50% health, I'm singing healsong and will be FHP soon enough
without seeing you waste your mana.  If you want to drive by me,
do buffs buffs buffs... I can't think of a buff my bard would rather
not have.. well clarity but that only because it has no more effect
on me than it would on a warrior.

Tops on my "hey don't DO that without asking" are POTG and the
similar shaman Focus cast on my cleric... both of these overwrite my
BAOR, for less mana regen.  I think they have other effects that would
nominally be an improvement (more HP?  More AC?  HP Regen? )
but I  don't know and couldn't care less, the most important thing I can
possibly have as a cleric is mana regen as much and as fast as possible.
Clicking off their horror buffs and putting BAOR up costs me time
and mana, this is much more annoying than my bard having to just
click off the unwanted SOW so he's had to run for 6 seconds at the
crawl of a 57 druid's SOW speed ( heh, I do travel with a 57 druid
a lot and yes its a noticable speed hit.  I WALK on selo's faster than
she runs on SOW)

If only there was a way to make myself impregnable to specific
unwanted "buffs" that degrade my performance!
