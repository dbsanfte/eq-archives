Well, you would think with all the practice they have MAKING corpses, they 
would be good at pulling them too.  :)  Hey, stop shooting those arrows at 
me, ow ow ow!

I'm wondering if it has to do with level.  Like how a 59 or 60 can single 
pull almost anything of the Kobalds in Velks Lab IF they pull with spell 
or range weapon.

I don't know all the spells rangers get, but I can't think of anything off 
the top of my head.  He didn't send another character down to pull Phinny 
then CoH him as soon as he threw the dagger or whatnot, did he?  I know 
the old bard trick used to be to use an Eye of Zomm, face the wall in a 
certain spot, and eye would pop up in Phinny's lair.  I'm wondering if 
it's a line-of-sight bug through a wall or something.  Any mages know?
