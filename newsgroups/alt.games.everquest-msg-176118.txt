Hi:

I'm a level 60 Wizard, and I've put off leveling up in favor of attaining AA
points. I now have 35 AA's, of which 9 are still available to spend. I have
Spell Casting Fury Mastery two already. It was my intention to purchase
Spell Casting Fury Mastery (three) - but I feel that this may not be the
wisest choice at the moment.

I want to play a major role in helping my guild mates attain Epic status, so
raw damage is what I want. I'm wondering if the best way to do this is to
purchase Mental Clarity one, two and three, and then Manaburn.

My question is - how *much* damage can I reasonably expect to do with
Manaburn? My total Mana currently stands at the 4K mark, I deal pretty good
damage with Ice Spear and Sunstrike, with my maximum critical hit being
3553. Forgetting the critical hits though, I can expect to deal out very
large amounts of damage over the duration of a fight with a mob - will
Manaburn be my best option?

Finally - As Manaburn is un-resistible, could I reasonably expect to solo
yellow or even red mobs occasionally? My guess is no.

Many thanks in advance to any replies I might get.

Stevie.
