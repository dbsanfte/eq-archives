The weapons are so close together ratio wise that the results would be hard
to predict.  I did some experimenting in Copelands with various ratios, and
the damage to delay ratio is a good indicator, but not exact.  The damage
produced, according to Copelands can be higher for a comparison similar to
the one you performed.  My contention regarding the ratio is that you should
not ignore it when choosing a secondary hand weapon, if there is a
significant disparity in ratios, then the better ratio weapon is the one to
use, not the faster weapon.  I don't have a rogue to perform this testing
with, I would suggest a longer time on the log for each weapon.  Copeland's
shows the Tomb Carver doing less damage over time, including backstabs in
the calculation, but he admits that except at high levels, he is not happy
with the backstab damage calculations he has.  This is certainly turning
into an interesting exercise.
