I still cant see it being normal at the time....basic game design in and
outside makes it a bad idea to have client side control of such matters -
and with internet griefing in various MUDS etc already seen and the huge
range of hacks/cheat codes etc utilised indicating the resources were
there to do it suggests to me the same it did to Faned - Corporate laying
down the law...

D2 I never bought I was playing other things but I payed on friends
machines and yes it really fixed everything like that.

Umm single player was good, it had very repetitive sequences in it but the
player character advancement and story made up for it.
Then, the multiplay in the UK really was based on going through
Blizzard  and so you were stuck with the bad multiplay issues..it was
really marketed quite heavily on that. It was certainly the primary reason
why I bought it and the staff ni shops talked about it (OK I sure that
thats not why everyone did). 

Sure they did a lot to fix them but to my mind it overturns the argument
that Blizzard havent released anything substandard becase they did release
Diablo as was. So you can't use the statement made as a reason Blizzard
would not screw up IMO. THeir catch up does suggest they are the kind of
comapny that would react to problems though (but that wasnt in the
original quote)
