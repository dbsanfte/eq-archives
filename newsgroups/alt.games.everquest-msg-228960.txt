4.  I'm keeping count of the people who saw the obvious solution.

In the pet's state keep track of mana used to summon it.

This, apparently, did not occur to the devs.  People with IRE
are getting positive returns by removing their SEIII item before
reclaimin.

Yep, James wins this one, they check for you mana saving abilities
and equipment during reclaim to calculate the amount returned.

Of all the dumb ass, poorly thought out kludges, this one is 
definitely one of the worst.
