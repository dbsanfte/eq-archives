And obviously, you are from another dimension, since you obviously don't
know the definition of KSing either.

A player can go into wherever he wants, what he cannot do is dominate a
spawn area, take mobs currently engaged on another player without that
player's expressed permission, or train mobs on another player
intentionally.

Since you seem to suggest doing the very thing they are not suppose to...
Obviously, you aren't on the same plane of existance as the rest of us by
encouraging them to do yet another bad thing that is worse than KSing.
