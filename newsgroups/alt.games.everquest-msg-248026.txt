I prefer my guild's system.  All items have the same base value of 10 points
(there are 4 point and 7 point categories, but we've progressed far enough
that most everything ends up being a 10 point item these days).  The item
that drops is offered to the raid at the base value as the starting point,
and people can bid up from there, auction style.  You accumulate points
through attendance, and the amount you bid is deducted from your accumulated
points.  It's totally open to view, obviously, being a "public auction", and
I can't imagine a more "fair" system.  It also puts loot decisions directly
in the hands of the members, and allows officers to acquire items without
any cries of favoritism.

There is some bookkeeping required, attendance and point tallies, but any
system based on attendance will need that much bookkeeping anyway.
