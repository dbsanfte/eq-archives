Well, that's it for me.  I'm cancelling my second account the next time I
play.  I'll do a few more things with my guild on my first account, and then
that's probably going, too.  Having the new research require no drop
research books that are found only in an expansion zone is the last straw.

No, no one here can have my stuff.

It was fun, Sony, and I would have let you have my $156/year per account
indefinitely, even when not playing...but you got too greedy with LoY.
