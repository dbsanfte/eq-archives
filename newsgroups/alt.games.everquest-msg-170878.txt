Hmm, always seems to wear off way faster than KEI.  In fact my Warrior
on test had KEI (wandered thru an MGB casting of it in bazaar) and later
got Blessing of Aegolism (same duration according to Lucy) and KEI was
still up for a long time after Aego faded.  Must've just been a case of
poor sense of time passing for me to think Aego had faded in only about
an hour and a half (no, it wasn't dispelled, that I am sure of), and the
KEI was obviously substantially extended by Focus and/or AA.
