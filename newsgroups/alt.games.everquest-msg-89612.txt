  I have no interest on playing on the Legends server, for two reasons.  One is
that I enjoy Firiona Vie because some people actually roleplay there, which is,
believe it or not, a reason I play EQ.  I wouldn't be playing EQ at all if it
weren't for the FV server.

  Second, it's something new and relatively untested.  That means that there's a
strong likelihood a lot of things are going to be wrong with it.

  Yes, I acknowledged and agreed with this point in my previous message.

  I'd pay more money per month for better service on my current server, if I got
ironclad guarantees about the service... as in "somebody will respond to your
petition within 3 hours, every time" and "tech support will respond to your
issue within two business days."  I wouldn't pony up more money per month unless
I had some assurance that I'd actually receive better service.
