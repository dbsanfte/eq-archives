found a spot in OT at location pos 3000, 900 roughly where some great stuff
passes by that you can learn from.  My 19th warrior was doing quite well
there, got more than half way to 20th soloing there.  He is heavily twinked
out, and was buying bandages from the city at pos 2500, pos 2500 so can heal
up fast.  he is agnostic, so gets along with the city.  Looking forward to
doing the 2hb quest that gives him porting abilities to OT.

I'm sure there are many other places like this where you can go that aren't
well known.  Aviak village is well known, but also a good spot, in south
karana.
