A couple hours was an exaggeration, but 20-30 minutes is not true of a
soloing caster either.   I lost an hour, at least, per death including the
inevitable CR to regain the little bit of xp it gives back.  Running back to
your corpse is no more fun in DAOC than it is in EQ.  It takes no less time,
either.  Then there's the medding between kills.  It's faster than EQ but
not THAT much faster at level 16.  I still had time to read a couple pages.
