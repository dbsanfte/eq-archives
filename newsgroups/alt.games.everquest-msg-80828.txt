Do you mean the one behind Yael? A halfling can squirm through the gaps.
It goes to a blank wall. Allegedly the entry to Brell's plane of
Underfoot or whatever the fuck it would be called. Not in the game yet.
If there's another exit door, I've never found it, and I've crawled a
LOT of that zone with my non KOS rogue, but certainly not every square
foot. Where is this door? I'll take a look.
