Okay, I have hit level 51 (it may not be that big an achievement, but it 
is to me!) and seek advice on a couple of points.

Mana.  My wis is 237.  Is this acceptable?  (I am still soloing all the 
time, mostly due to the ease I can drop in/out of the game.) I haven't 
had a problem with mana yet, but I have a feeling that I might soon! 
Would I be right that equipment from here onwards is likely to be 
dropped/quested for any improvement?

AA.  Is it worth starting to collect AA xp or should I wait until later? 
I think someone posted here that it is 'easier' to acquire at higher 
levels.  Oh and do differing mobs/zones give better/worse AA xp than 
level xp?

Finally, I have hunted Cobalt Scar for the last level and I love the xp 
and the loot, but it does get crowded and the drakes don't like me much! 
Is there anywhere with comparable quadding potential, but maybe more 
space and/or less people?

Thank you for any advice forthcoming.
