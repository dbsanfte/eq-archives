Actually, when Brad McQuaid used to read AND post here,
nobody gave him much flak about it.  It was pretty well accepted
that it WAS him (I think he was just scared of Alistar ;-)  ), and
folks had run his headers and info through the ringer, too.

The fact was, nothing was posted that somebody who'd been
through a big "change a bunch of core stuff" patch didn't already
know or could predict.  I bought Luclin in the store (and thereby
received it before the folks who pre-ordered...AGAIN ;-)  ),
and KNEW that I probably wouldn't be able to get a decent
playing experience for at least a week.  Log in trouble, patcher
trouble, bugs...all of it happens when VI makes a big change.
We cut 'em some slack because we've all been through it
before, and expect to be through it again with PoP's release.
We love their game (if not, what the hell are you doing here?),
and while we make legitimate complaints, it's a KNOWN
issue that some of the regulars here might know a bit more
about their own game than some of the actual programmers
(alchemy works, we swear!!!).

Inside information would have to be pretty damn impressive to
make anybody for a MOMENT believe that your'e a VI employee.
Sony doesn't cut it...I have a friend that works at a Radio Shack
and could post a mail from his feed-back account at Sony full
of Sony headers and info.  It doesn't mean he's from VI.  Now
if he posted from the same place, but threw in some of the
code (like the actual fucking equation for backstab damage,
which is known ALMOST perfectly, but still not nearly as accurately
as mana calcs and such) folks would take you seriously.

And Brad, just in case you occasionally paw through here (and
I'm aware of the old "don't post a 'Brad Mckade reed th1s!!!!1!'
rule ;-)  ) :
WHAT IS THE ACTUAL GODDAMN FORMULA FOR BACKSTAB?
HOLY CHRIST, SINCE APRIL OF '99 I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO MAKE A FIRM PREDICTION OF WHERE MY BACKSTABS
SHOULD BE...PLEASE, GOD, I MUST KNOW!!!!!!
