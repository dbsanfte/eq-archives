The *only* negative aspect I've seen to these zone revamps is that I 
suddenly don't know my way around them anymore. Aside from that, it can't 
be argued that the new zones look much better (though their first pass at 
Nektulos Forest still kind of baffles me - I very much like the final 
incarnation, though).

I don't have any problems with lag in the revamped zones, btw. /shrug

Perhaps. I am curious as to what criteria they use to choose the next zone 
to revamp, however. Personally, I think Kelethin would be an excellent 
choice. Yeah, it's kind of deserted these days, but I really can't argue 
with them revamping graphics anywhere.
 
As for the rest of the patch - *yawn*.
