Is it possible to have both good Giant and Dragon Factions? 
Except for the Thurgadin Shawl, I am thinking that many of
the Kael Quests look real nice for druid, but being a druid,
I really don't want to have to worry about porting into WL
and being made into Dragon Kibbles.  Is it possible to Raise
Giant Faction by destroying Coldain faction, without
Destroying CoV faction as well?  Or am I better off to get
what I want from Kael and then go on a CoV faction Repair
kick by slaughtering my previous benefactors?

My Druid has just hit 30, so I am ready to start making my
alignments with the various factions.  

TIA
