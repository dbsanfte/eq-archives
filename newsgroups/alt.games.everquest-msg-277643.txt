Not sure which file it is, but you should be able to edit the file that 
has the window positions, and change it manually.  Have not had to deal 
with this yet personally, so can't say for certain.

Another possible solution is to load an alternate UI, and unclick the 
keep current layout (or whatever it is called), then reload the UI he 
wants to use.  Not sure what that will do to positioning off hand though.
