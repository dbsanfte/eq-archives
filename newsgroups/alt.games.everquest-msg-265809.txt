Aye, as a cleric I can solo comfortably.  There has to be some skill
involved, mind you, but I don't feel overly weak.  I've heard that until
20th level we priests are the best soloers, but that after that point we
begin to fall behind.

All of which should be taken with a grain of salt, as they have
continuously been tweaking things.
