You know what?  Rangers get berated alot too.  Guess why?  They die a lot. 
Why?  They are protecting casters.  That's their job.  If a cleric or chanter
dies (in a regular group) and my ranger is still standing I am not doing my
job.  
There is no other time I keep agro that long.
I get pretty tired of ranger bashing.  But the people who tell the jokes are
unworthy of my response.
