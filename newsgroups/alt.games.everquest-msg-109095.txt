Joy at the infliction of pain on others is simply further down the
road of raging selfishness.  Lowering the status of everyone else
improves your status by comparison.

There is no one point at which you can say evil has begun.  Evil is a
continuum, with greater and lesser versions possible.

Stalin was evil.  I myself believe Saddam Hussein to be evil (although
perhaps not everyone will agree).  Hitler was insane and evil, in that
he translated his narcissism into Aryanism, substituting the
advancement of a select few for personal advancement.

Societies can perform evil acts, but I think only individuals can be
truly evil?
