I play a lvl 34 Bard (few kills from 35, finally I can track!)

The crystallized sword sounds like a good bet...shoot for 400pp though...600
is too much already (on Xegony anyway)...amazing how fast things drop in
prices these days.  If you can find one, get a Gleaming Short Sword, it's
the same stats as crystalline sword and has +5charisma.  I bought one for
500pp (pretty sure I got a deal though)

As for jewelry... Depends what your main focuses as a bard are.  Everyone
has a different play style, and you should buy according to yours.  How do
you like to play?  Are you a melee bard?  Are you often (or will you be)
doing Crowd Control?  Do you do group support?  Do you mainly solo or group?

Personally I play with a tank-heavy group regularly, so I'm often doing
crowd control and support (haste songs, stat buffs, etc).  So, my jewelry
has dex/cha  (dex so I don't miss notes often, charisma for
mezzing/charming) stats.  Star ruby rings (+5cha/+7dex each - player made),
opalline earrings (+5cha each - dropped in Unrest), Mask of Deception
(+13cha - dropped in Lower Guk), Cats eye agate bracelet (+7cha - player
made), Cats eye agate necklace (+7 or 9 cha can't remember - player made),
and I have full lambent which has all kinds of stats but +1 cha per piece
except for helm which has +3.  I've also got a belt (unsure what it's
called; Sludged Girdle I think) with dex/agi/cha, and a Cloak of Leaves (agi
I think).  All this brings my dex to 110 or so and my charisma around 150 (I
can get it to 180 in full cha gear if necessary.  eg: Crude Stein and
another cats eye agate bracer), and my agility is pushing 120 (for when the
tanks can't do enough dmg to taunt off me, LOL).

If you group often, I'd go with agility, strength, and dexterity jewelry,
unless you're filling in for the chanter, then swap out for charisma.  If
you solo by charm kiting, go all dex and cha.  If you solo using your
weapons, str, agi and dex.

That's the thing with Bards.  We're very versatile, and in that respect we
can need certain stats to be higher in different situations, depending on
where you are, who's in your group, etc, etc.  That said, remember that
stats don't really affect your play that much either (perhaps with charisma
being an exception doing crowd control...I've personally witnessed huge
differences in resists by adding a few points of charisma).  Good luck, I
hope this helps!
