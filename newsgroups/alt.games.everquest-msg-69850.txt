Running a Celeron 433 with a PCI GeForce2 64MB with 384 MB Ram, runs pretty
good for the most part, the moon (cat city, in particular) is very laggy but
other zones up there are playable.  I have no major complaints.  I am
playing with 20 of the new models turned on and I have my graphics @ medium
quality and 1024*768 resolution.
