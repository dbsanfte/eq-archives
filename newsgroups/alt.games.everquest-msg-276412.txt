Yes, you can solo in EQ2.   There are some quests you'll
most likely want to group to do.  You'll also level slower
than someone who groups.   But you CAN solo in EQ2.

One thing to remember -- EQ2 is a *grouping* game in
which you can solo.  But the IoR is a pretty good indicator
of what the entire game is like (some mobs you don't fight
solo, some quests you don't do solo, etc. along with lots
of solo content..)
