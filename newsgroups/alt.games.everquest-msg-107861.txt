ok just to make you happy ill ask for some other things as well.

1) cleric symbol spells should have the gem componet removed.
2) bard songs should have a specific special 6 buff slots added and they
should no longer use the regular slots.
3) the pacify line of spells should all be made non aggro
4) mem blurs should be fixed to always work like they used to.
5) exactly why do mind control spells like mez care if you happen to be a
large lump instead of a small lump?
6) summoned pets are all screwed up, id like them fixed to the level of a
low blue mob. in other words any pet by any caster at level 60 should be
about the equivalent of a lvl 45 mob.
7) wizards and probably all other casters as well should get the ability to
cast any spell in there aresenal using extra time instead of mana. say
triple the casting time and remove the mana cost.
8) monks should gain a button to remove themselves from all hate lists . or
at the very least let them camp out while feigned. Qing out gets incredibly
annoying after awhile.
9) mobs of the same level should have roughly the same combat ability. There
ought to be spells that let you judge this. It ought to be basically linear.
This means that most uber mobs really should be level 120 and say so. The
statue of rallos zek is 55 , the emperor in sebilis is 60. Something just
aint right, I want truth in advertising.
10) the risk to reward for killing mobs should be made as close as possible.
