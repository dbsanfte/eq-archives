OK, swap guidelines for rules in what I posted.  It is still specifically
against the guidelines that have been provided to us players.  I know, and
agree, that in the end, it is up to the GM to decide whether or not to
change the name, but the guidelines are quite specific when it comes to
trademarks and copyrights, no ifs, ands or buts about it.

I don't see how you can presume that a name can be copyrighted or
trademarked, and fall within the guidelines, the guidelines are very
specific in that regard.  A GM may choose not to enforce the guidelines,
that is his or her choice to make, it does not change the fact that the name
violates said guidelines.
