Verant is implementing revamps to old-world newbie zones in stages.
There are newer drops in the Qeynos already (plaugue rat tails, coyote
skulls, ect), but no quests have been added yet. 

It is quite "conceivable" that an incremental change to crushbone was
intended, and something got screwed up in the loot/drop tables. The
fact that the Orcs were dropping the max number of coins that can be
held before a roll-over is significant. (999pp, 999gp, 999sp. 999cp).
It would only take a small glitch in the data import of 1 field in 1
table to cause such a glitch.

You don't have to be a VAK to allow for glitches in a system as large
and complex as EQ. Doodoo happens, and more often then not on Patch
day :-P
