This is another level limit I've been curious about... does anyone know 
what actually happens if you have a 46+ wizard grouped with a low level 
and cast Alter Plane?

And similarly, what if you IVU and run past the spectres to the Fear zone?

Not that these would be particularly good ideas, as it would be a heck of 
a CR, but I'm curious... Might have to try that fear zone with a mule. :)
