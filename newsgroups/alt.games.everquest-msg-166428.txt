Mmmm. True; nonetheless, I regularly typed faster than data was
transmitted. The lag was noticable, and sometimes caused some
embaressment as a touch typist used to watching for and correcting
errors in 'real time' I could press return before noticing
somewhat freudian replacements in what I'd meant to say.

But I'm happy to accept that was down to factors other than the modem
speed, now you point it out.
