I'm working on the monk "shackle" quests, and ran into a snag.
I finally managed to draw off the ogre raider who was causing
Oowomp the Great to aggro on me, so I could go back and talk to
to Oowomp in peace.  I got him to summon the dancing skeleton,
then talked to the skeleton and got the "hand with one only the
thumb" or whatever mangled name it has.  Since I want to do the
quest more than once (because the top-level shackle gets used
up in a later quest), and because it's such a pain getting to
talk to Oowomp, I wanted to get a second thumb-only hand while
I was there.  So I'd come prepared, bringing with me the four
different length skeletal fingers to complete the (lore) hand.
I figured once I combined it it would form a new item (which
is how other quest containers seem to work) and I'd be able to
get a new, empty hand to take away with me.

Expecting at any moment that the ogre raider would repop and
make Oowomp attack me again, I quickly opened the hand, moved
the four fingers into it, and clicked Combine.  Nothing happened.
Not even a "you can't combine those items in this container"
message.  I tried lots of variations, rearranging the fingers,
opening the container with control-right-click, etc.  Nothing.

Is there anyone out there who's done this quest who can tell
suggest what I might be doing wrong?  My current best guess is
that the recent changes to tradeskill containers has broken
this item, and after talking to a GM via /petition he ended
up suggesting I send in a /bug, which I did.  But he also
suggested I make sure I'm using the right recipe.  (Seems
pretty obvious: four skeletal fingers, which have to be
different lengths since they're all lore.)  Hm, it's possible
one of the fingers originated on a different server, since
this character got moved at one point.  But I wouldn't expect
that to matter, right?

I'm basically stuck on this whole quest series unless I can
get past this point.  Please help!!
