	I don't think chorkie's someone to laugh at.  She's just
not one of you I-have-93-Level-70's-and-so-I-never-make-mistakes
players.  Everything she's said is perfectly appropriate to someone
of her experience and level.  Of *course* she's sure she's right.
If she thought she was wrong she'd be behaving differently, hmmm?

	IMHO it would be better both for the game and the newsgroup
if people were less...blunt...with sincere but inexperienced people.

	Why not?  I don't think there has to be some absolute ranking
or that "Unless you've soloed Quarm at least *twice* you don't have 
anything meaningful to contribute" is a productive attitude.  I'm 
*glad* there are still less-than-perfectly-experienced people playing.  
It means there's still hope for the game.

	Heh.  You guys are always living in the past anyway: "I miss
having to run naked through 7 zones to get killed by a rat while I was
looting my corpse" but you object to someone being proud of less than 
Timely adventures...  A bit of cognitive dissonance, that.
