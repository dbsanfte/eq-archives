The collapsible containers all share one key ingredient in common, and
that's coiled springs.  If the tinker collects them in PoI, then the
collapsible containers are very cheap to make.  If they buy them in the
bazaar, then the containers are more expensive, depending on what crazy
price the spring sellers feel like charging.

The two containers with annoying sub-combines (several of them have
sub-combines, but there are two that are most annoying) are the mixing bowl
and the mortar and pestle.  They require 4 folded sheets of metal, which in
turn require further sub-combines.

So basically, with collapsible containers, more than many tinkered items,
you're paying mostly for the time spent skilling up and doing the combines,
because the ingredients are reasonably cheap.  (Oh, and the other annoying
thing about them, is they're lore, so vendors can only have one at a time).

It looks like the pricing cartel are back and running on Torv, and
everything that starts 'collapsed' in the bazaar is exactly 600pp today.
