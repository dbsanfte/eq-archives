Yep, but i wanted to know if anyone from germany got the same problem.
BUT - its solved now...  I wrote a letter to one of the system admins
at "ixp1.nl1.concert.net", and he reconfigured the router within a few
hours. Now its working REALLY fine here: I got a stable ping of 30-60.
No more worries, no further complaints. ;)
