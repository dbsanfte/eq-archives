Paratheist:     Belief that there is a god in the next universe over, 
                whether or not there's one in this one.
Metatheist:     Belief that if a god exists, it will also have to have a 
                god to follow.
Temporatheist:  Belief that there's a god sometimes, but not always.
Agnostic:(2)    Belief that a god's existence cannot be proven.
Syntheist:      Belief that there is simultaneously a god and not a god.
Antitheist:     Belief that if there is a god, it sucks.
Antetheist:     Belief that there was once a god.
Dystheist:      Belief that if there is a god, it's nuts.
Eutheist:       Belief that if there is a god, it's nice.
Autotheist:     Belief that if there's a god, it's me.
Prototheist:    Belief that if there is a god, it's just a first draft.
