No.

One of the patrons, certainly.  Define "chief" in this context.

Wasn't trying to argue against that bit of obviousness.

Heh, this is usenet.  I wasn't "promoting" the USA, I was slamming
the self-righteousness of historicly naive Brits.  I've always found
these to be particularly grotesque examples of the evils perpetuated
in the name of "empire" and "commerce" by a supposedly enlightened
culture.

I would (and do) agree whole-heartedly with that sentiment.  In fact,
it's my position that that sentiment, haltingly and inconsistently
expressed and followed though it may be, is what's right about America.
Contrary to those who see hypocrisy in attempts to "seize the moral
high ground", I see hope.  So long as we have an open society that
values the expression and pursuit of ideals, and at least some of the
time holds its leaders accountable for any subversion of the ideals,
we are working towards, and can hope for, a better world.

No, they don't.  But it's hard to get a fair hearing of your position
when you start an emotionally charged debate in a hostile fashion while
ignoring the fact that your own clay feet extend up to around your neck.
(Yes, yes, I've been guilty of the same stupidity in this forum, on more
than one occasion, but as you pointed out above...)

Agreed.

Well, I did a poor job of making myself clear then.  I was <not>
trying to justify any "imperialist" behavior by various American
organizations and individuals, including our federal government.
I was slamming British hypocrisy on the topic (and would have
cheerfully slammed on nationals of any other country I saw doing
the same thing).  In essence, I was trying to point out that the
dung being thrown came from the giant steaming pile the throwers
were standing upon.
