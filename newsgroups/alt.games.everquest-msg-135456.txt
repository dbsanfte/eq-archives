It's going to take getting used to, but I think I like it.  I did buy a few
spells I'll be needing at some decent prices.  The one little drawback is
that /who, and the "who" button both lock up EQ solid for me.  I have to
kill it, and restart EQ.  So, for the time being, I'll stick with the old
UI.  Also, in the old UI, now, I have the phantom cursor in the middle of my
screen now.  The trick with changing resolutions between the windowed and
full screen mode fixes that though.
