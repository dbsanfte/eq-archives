Well - supposedly he retired in disgust with the way PoT was set up,
but Jaytee's most recent post had a screenshot that showed Furor in
guild chat soooo...........  you make your own inferences :)

The funniest thing is that, soon after he threw his huge temper tantrum,
saying that if SOE didn't fix things the way he wanted he'd quit and take
FoH with him to WoW, AL started beating the encounters he said were too
fucked up to even try.

We all know PoT is probably bugged, like the Sleeper script was, like 
every other endgame encounter and zone was the first time people went
in, but that's what happens when you live on the bleeding edge of the
game like FoH and AL.
