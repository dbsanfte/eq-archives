I've wondered the same thing myself...it would be nice to do something
with the random nodrop items I still have in my bank.  The problem is,
SOE has no idea how much tribute to associate with them.  Most
equippable items are some kind of average of bazaar prices, and the
random vendor trash is worth exactly the same as the plat you'd get
from selling it.  Just using the prices on FV isn't enough of a
distribution for assigning Tribute to the nodrop items most likely.

Another problem would be with farming quests to get tribute.  Take the
Fine Antique Ring quest...less than 100 pp for a Mana Preservation II
ring, but at least it's nodrop so you have to do it yourself.  They
would have to investigate every single nodrop item that's a result of
a quest to see how easy it is, and adjust the prices accordingly.

Basically, it's too much work for them to do, so we aren't very likely
to see it happen.  For droppable items, they had the information
already, or available to them.  For nodrop items, they suddenly have
to assign values and that's really a huge undertaking.

Game on,
