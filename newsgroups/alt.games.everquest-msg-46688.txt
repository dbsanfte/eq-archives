Table changed slightly e.g. OG with DG is == not -

I think form what they said about "equivelent to grouping bonus" that a
full group of OG (for example) would get a 20% bonus. This would mean
that each + is about +2% and each - about -2%.

EG a group of OG,OG,OG,NG,NG,DG

OGs get ++,++,+,+,- or +++++ or +10%
NGs Get +,+,+,+,+ or +++++ or +10%
DGs get =,=,=,+,+ or ++ or 4%

Of course this could all be wrong :-P


HTH,

Jim
