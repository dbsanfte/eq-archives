Reactivate your old account... which is a fairly good idea anyway, just to
check your old chars are still there :o)

Make sure that both accounts are billed to the same credit card and that the
personal info on both accounts matches... THIS IS IMPORTANT - see below

It'll cost $50 US (charged to the same credit card that's paying for BOTH
accounts), to transfer a char from one account to another... but if they're
on the same server, your equipment will also follow you. If you're
successful, you can then go ahead and cancel the now empty account.

If Verant thinks you've just bought an account on Ebay and are trying to
move the decent character onto your real account before cancelling the Ebay,
then they will refuse to process your transfer... and may even ban/suspend
one or both accounts! That's why it's important that all the billing and
personal details are the same on BOTH accounts.
While you could argue that you're moving your own char from a friends
account... if the billing adresses are in 2 different states... or 2
different countries... you'd have to be pretty persuasive in your arguement
:o)
