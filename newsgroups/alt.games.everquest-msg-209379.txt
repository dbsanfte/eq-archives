lol 1st time i looked in here for a while. I thought your flaming was reserved
for the EZBoards. Or have you been banned from there yet since that argument
you had with Absor on the boards?

I really can't understand why you play the game when you constantly flame
everything about the game and everybody who is involved with it. If you don't
like it there is a Cancel Subscription button at the main log on screen. If i
thought the way you did and constantly felt the need to flame something which i
use then i just wouldn't use it any more. It's as simple as that.
