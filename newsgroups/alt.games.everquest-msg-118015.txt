OK, to help make sure you never ever play a bard, lets discuss Juggling.

Songs come in several instrument categories.

Singing songs are the easiest, they run the same regardless of what instrument

or weapons you may have equipped.

Other songs are instrument improved, where holding the right instrument
gives a better effect.  THis effect is easily visible with Selo's Accelerando,

which is normally about as fast as JBoots (or a level 9 shaman's SOW)
but which kicks into high gear if there is a drum in your hand when you
play it.

Still other songs work -only- with the right instrument in hand, the first of
these is Clouding (invis song).  I'm not sure yet how these work with
juggling, thus far there's been little need for me to experiment.

Instruments go (with only one exception I can think of at the moment) in the
secondary hand slot but are basically two handed, so that you can have
nothing in the primary slot while using an instrument.

The simplest choice is to put a weapon in each hand and use only Singing
based songs, or suffer the lessened effects of singing instrument based
songs.

Another choice (known as "going on instruments") is to use a combination
of singing based and a single instrument based songs, and hold the appropriate

instrument, forgoing melee damage more or less entirely (you can do a tiny
amount with Hand to Hand skill, as your primary hand is open so can attack)

The nightmare choice though, is Juggling.

Song effects work as buffs with a very short duration, and the strength of
their
effect  is based on whats in hand at the instant the song finishes casting (or

each subsquent tic if you leave song on so it refreshes.

SO its possible to use three different instruments, with three seperate songs,

by swapping instruments in so that the correct one is in hand each time its
song hits.

Further, weapon delay cycles are entirely independant of song cycles, so
its possible to be swinging weapons most of the time, and only have
instruments in on the instants they are important.

I have a hotkey page set up entirely with slots

Primary Secondary
Inventory 1 Inventory 2
Inventory 3 Inventory 4

In those slots are two weapons and three
instruments.

Starting with weapons in hand, its click primary, inventory slot with weapon,
secondary, this puts your main weapon in inv 1, instrument in secondary,
and secondary weapon on your pointer.

Once the song finishes casting you start the next, put secondary back,
instrument in slot 1, primary weapon back in hand.

Now pick up primary, go to slot 2, then to secondary just in time
for song 2 to finish casting, then replace those instruments and
weapons back in hand.

A full three song three instrument -and- two weapon twist and
juggle is a masterpiece of control and rythm such that you can
see a -direct- parrallel with actual musical talent.

Personally its about all I can handle to juggle in my brass instrument
for Discord while fighting and twisting two singing based songs.
