There's a bunch of newbie quests for armor & weapons for Iksar, not
exactly like the other races newbie armor quests though.

There's some crappy quests for cloth for any class, better off keeping
those spider(ling) silks and trading them in the bazaar for some decent
newbie armor.

There were some medium level quests, mostly for SKs I seem to remember,
and there's some armor/weapon quests in neriak now but they are very
weak.
