I was in PoK a couple of days ago, and the very same example occured - a mid
40s ranger was spamming they wanted a lift to stonebrunt for a good 10
minutes. I told him he could have run there by now, to which he replied "I
don't know the way". I told him, and also pointed him to www.eqatlas.com.
There seems to be alot of people around that if it's not 1 zone from a book
or port point, they won't go there.

Whatever happened to going to a zone just for the sake of seeing what it's
like?
