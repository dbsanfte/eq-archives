Well what i meant.. some classes trade solobility for lack of group and raid
abilities (i.e necros) wheras druids are awesome soloers, they walk into
groups at the low levels as a main healer ( i remember when i was a noob, a
poor little mage always lfg, and the only class groups wanted was a druid)

Then at higher levels, they are mostly welcomed in dungeon groups (snare and
evacs) sure Wizards can do that too, but theres a *lot* more druids then
wizards, plus a lot of groups like a backup healer over a nuker (wizards are
pretty wasted in single target mob groups)

And then on raids, they are the second most powerful nukers, they have a
group buff with mana regen, they can heal for almost 1k, they have an
awesome fire/cold resist buff

Not bad for a "worthless" class that needs fixing, huh?
