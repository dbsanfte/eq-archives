   I don't know that that assessment is what I would call cynical.  They know
that there is a large population that wants to be in beta, and they know they
have limited slots.  Why not make a buck or two at it, and sell an RTS game that
most eq players seems unconcerned with?
   
   Really, what does buying an RTS have to do with one's desirability as a
MMORPG beta tester anyways?  I mean, I doubt that EQII is going to be anything
at all like a RTS game.  This is purely about selling space in beta.

    I'm almost ashamed to say that I thought about it for a half a second or so.
