I have foraged that in Natimbi.  The zone-in area should be safe for you.

Regarding the Anaconda Meat, my experience has been that the Anacondas of 
Nedaria's Landing are not meaty at all.  It takes the ones from Jaggedpine 
Forrest to supply one for baking.  I think those more hearty brothern may be 
challenging for level 39, perhaps even deadly.
