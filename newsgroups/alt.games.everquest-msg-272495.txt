This is typical Verant/Sony.  They have been this way since day one.  They 
don't care about your opinion, just their own.

They have even banned people from the game itself... permanently, for 
posting negative messages on their message board.  This is fact.  Its also 
of course illegal since the message board is not even part of the game, and 
no one purchased a message board when they bought a GAME.

Sony thinks they are God and can do whatever they please, even if it means 
breaking the law.  They think they can just add something to the EULA and it 
becomes law for America.
