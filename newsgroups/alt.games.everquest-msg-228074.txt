Not for account bannings but I can vouch first hand experience as of last
night it is still possible to to turn 9 silver into 18 platinum in 9
combines which would be easily macroable.

(Yup - I bugged it)

I would bet my left nut to a penny that the accoutns getting banned are
disposable 1st level macro accounts which aren't played anyway. The golden
rule of exploiters is to never use your primary account.
