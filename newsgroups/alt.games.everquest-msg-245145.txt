| Good day-
|
| I love sopping up the A Jus that is the AGE forums.
|
| I'm up to lvl 26- maxed my hid-sneak-backstab skills.  For the life of
| me I cannot get a consistent sneak attack.  I have the pause set at 30
| which gives me about a 4 sec delay it seems- but it only works once in
| a blue moon- and even then it's hardly anything to brag about.
|
| Am I missinging something here.  I have the Fabled Dragon Dirk it
| think its 11/21 or something.
|
| How do you have your macro set- or am I just begining to understand
| the nerf that is the rogue.

I've been trying to get this working too .... have a macro setup which works
fine if it's the first time I attack a mob. The same macro however doesn't
work if used during a fight, I get a message saying I haven't been hidden
long enough even thought hide was successful and it's the same delay before
the /disc sneak line in the hotkey.
