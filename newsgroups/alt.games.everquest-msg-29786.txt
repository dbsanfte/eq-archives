>>>SNIP<<<

I used to play a MUD called Waterdeep that was combined PvP and non-PvP.
Worked like this:

You had to choose to become PvP (Tome of Discord anyone?). After a certain
level, you lost this choice.

(say, if you have not gone PvP by level 25, you can't go PvP at all).

The blues (non PvP) could not cast spells of any kind on the reds (PvP), and
vice versa.

If a red killed another red inside of city limits, they became "wanted".
Wanted people could not gate (port, TP, etc), and basically had to run to
wherever they wanted to go. They were no longer wanted when 1) they were
killed or 2) a certain amount of time went by. (call it a week game time)

Just before I stopped playing, they had implemented a "bounty" system. You
could go to an npc, give them a certain amount of money to put a bounty on a
red's head. Whoever killed that red would receive whatever reward you put
up. Made for interesting guild v guild wars.

I had thought about that, having a purple server, but since most people I've
seen playing EQ have a hard enough time dealing with one type of server, I
don't think it will happen anytime soon.
