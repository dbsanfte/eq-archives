Fair enough. Truth be told, I enjoy them as well. That particular
evening the frustration got the better of me.

Of course, I was making what I thought to be a safe assumption there
regarding the majority.

No offense, but with very few exceptions, I just can't see a
professional failing 90% of the time at their profession - especially
when it's a task that they can perform with such little effort that
they are not able to improve themself by doing so. Yours may well be
one of those few exceptions.

Isn't the simple fact that you eventually do become more successful
indicative of a skill improvement? You don't just get more lucky. Your
success rate improves, and that can only come from getting better at
it. It's that basic concept that my dissatisfaction with the current
skillup system in EQ tradeskills.
