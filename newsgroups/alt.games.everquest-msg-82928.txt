Yeah you can mule, but it isn't as easy as in D2. You won't need to
for quite awhile. Twinking isn't fun in EQ.

You have a weight vs carry capacity. If you go over it you won't fight
as well. Money doesn't drop from the sky like D2, you sell and sell
often.

How many lives you got ;-) Look this isn't make 15 levels a day like
D2 this is a whole new ball game made by people that give a shit.

You're going to flip out when you get a taste of what the on line
community is like, apples and oranges. Play it non PvP first, you'll
need the help and guidance of others, especially making your first
char.

Look bottom line, I played from D on to Lod and this is the best. It
is different, not all that comparable. Don't do this or become like
the rest of us, hooked :-) See ya around.
