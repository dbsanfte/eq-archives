Perhaps so... Still, I'm typing this on my new G4 PowerMac, and although 
  my wallet hurts like a pinched bollock, I have to say that I don't 
know how I managed to wait this long. I feel like I've been beamed a 
computer from the 21st. Century, after having been living in the dark 
ages for so long.

Now I wonder why I've been putting up with so much and settling for so 
little, for so long. Yeah, perhaps it's not as fast as the PC I 
replaced, but you know what? It's plenty fast enough, which I *never* 
could say of any PC I've ever owned.
