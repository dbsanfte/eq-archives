9 person groups would be unbalanced as all hell. Oldschool exping becomes 
trivial with 3 more people, period.

My understanding is that raid exp is split differently (and not as 
favorably) than group exp.

The only argument I can see is from Magicians and Wizards etc... The 
tertiary classes, in other words. A full group these days has:

Cleric (or Shaman in a pinch)
Warrior (or Paladin or SK)
Chanter (or Bard)

The secondary characters in the group are utility and DPS.

Monk - Puller
Rogue - DPS

That leaves one slot for the druids, shammies, etc. I can see that as being 
pretty frustating.
