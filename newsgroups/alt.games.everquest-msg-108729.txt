Obviously wrong, by the simple facts that 1) people have been
complaining about it, and 2) you're posting this complaint about
people complaining.

By the way, just to be a nasty pedant, as per the long diatribe posted

"someone's" is supposed to have one.  Plural case in the first,
possessive case in the second.
