The point of the decay is to prevent a fungi tunic from being used to PL  
players in perpetuity. To put some pressure on mudflation.

Personally I'm in favour of repairable items, and faster degradation at 
lower levels, because I don't want to penalize high level players using 
their high level gear; I just want to ensure that its not efficient for 
low level players to use high level gear.

Oh come now; if they wear out -faster- than players can acquire them you 
will rapidly have a naked playerbase, if they ever manage to get fully 
dressed in the first place.

It's almost self-evident that the decay rate has to be slower than the 
accumulation rate.
