The consistent high rolls aren't necessarily my main problem with
characters like this guy.

If you announce you are leaving so the group is aware of the fact,
thank the rest of the group, possibly help the replacement get to the
camp site, yes.
If you have a case of:

'Player loots uber item'
'Player has left the group'

Especially after a case of

'Player sits in corner and does very little contributing'

No.

Well, they were gullible enough to let him join their group in the
first place after the rest of the dungeon had started smelling a rat.

I never said anything about *that* being necessary.
