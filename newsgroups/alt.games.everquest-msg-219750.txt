And that is what I mean by the warm body theory.  I knew motorcycle
mechanics that became "IT people" strictly because anyone with a pulse
was being hired.  Those people are no longer hired or kept.  I've
personally been with employers who "laid off" people that just weren't
cutting it only to hire better skilled, more experienced people at 50%
more.
