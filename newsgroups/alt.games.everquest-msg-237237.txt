There's a slight difference between software and books; books aren't
expected to be patched and upgraded, for one.

/laughs and points.

I'm currently wrestling with 2 compilers, both written from the same
ANSI specs (both companies were involved in writing the specs).  It's
absolutely astounding how many differences there are and how
*completely* incompatible the compilers are.

If they want to keep the revenue source then all they need to do is
renew the copyright each year, or every couple of years, or whatever.
But once they *stop* renewing it, then 5 years after, it's fair game.

They're seeking; they'll fail.

Once that happens you'll have new companies starting up selling basic
word processors, spreadsheets, and the like, and selling *software*,
not *licenses*.
