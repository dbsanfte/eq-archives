Ok, I don't want to dishearnten anyone here, so I might as well put down my
own clerics experience with Lord B. I was camping him and the tainted at the
same time, and one of my friends was along as his warrior to... well... do
what warriors do: Mow down things. We pulled EVERYTHING from the tower (not
in one go) and kept it clear, and Lord B spawned several times during this
process. (It was the tainted that was being a pain) But after 2 or 3 hours,
we had both pieces and could swim out.
