Sounds like you met someone who had no clue what enchanters can do at the
giant fort.  Tashani wouldn't have helped you mez 'em, it'd just help you
piss them off.

If you're hunting around giants, have charm memmed.  Also have mez
(enthrall, unless you get a better one at 29) memmed for non-giant adds.
Have root memmed if no one else is thinking to do it.  While outdoors, root
is one of the best crowd control options you have.
