So, I got the 4 service medallions for the quest, made my way to the
warriors guild in Neriak, but can't find Ferin Dernkal. He's supposed
to be standing on the roof of the building. I entered the guild
building by the right-hand wooden door, went up the wooden stairs, and
came out on a balcony overlooking the street in front of the guild.
There's a guard pacing around on one side, but no one on the other
side. I've camped out and returned several times but no one is ever
there. Am I looking in the right place?
