you should install everything.  While you don't have to use everything, it's
nice to have all the options there.  With tall the expansions you have 3
additional races (Iksar, Vah Shir (my absolute favorites =) and with Legend
of Ykesha the Froglok).  There are other benefits like better interface,
better graphics (With Shadows of luclin) as well as methods of travel with
planes of power.

install them all and if you're on Povar, look me up sometime!
