I bought Gates of Discord on Friday. Has some kind of keychain
thingy in the box, item in box item in game. I logged into station
and updated. The patch server downloads a pdf that says to click on
the 'update owned expansions' on the server page. Totally false. No
such button there. Its in Account on Station.

Anyway, I tried with two characters to get that goodie, it does say
that an uppermost inventory slot has to be free. I tried twice, with
2 different characters, about an hour apart. I got the same error
message.
