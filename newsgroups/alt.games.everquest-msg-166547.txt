My iksar monk have handed Shiverback (fear monk armor), bestlord (fear 
again, cant remember name though) in to the ikky monk NPC in evil part 
of town with no problems.
But the Greenmist armor, also from fear, SHD armor, were given right 
back. Tried the SHD trainers too, just in case, no luck either, tried to 
give to all trainers in evil part of town.
