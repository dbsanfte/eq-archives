I have a question.  Did the original harmony work indoors?  I've never used
it myself so I wouldn't know.  The reason I ask it because the new version,
Harmony of Nature doesn't work indoors.  I tried it last night while running
through Paludal Caverns and it didn't work It said this spell can only be
used outdoors.

Just curious.
