Nah, I didn't need to get your point there, as I agree that misspellings
of names or phonetic spellings are childish - the point where my opinion
differs is, that I wouldn't care as much as to petition them.
As long as the names are not offending in the way of vulgar
language or the like - why bother?

I have even grouped with people that were named Bakstabz Joo
and the like (Joo was later removed by a GM) and he was a very
fun person to play with. I did think the name was sort of not
very roleplaying-like, but then I have found people with perfectly
role-playing names in the way of Urga Gnomesmasher (for a troll,
for example, name made up) were the biggest jerks ever.
Though I must admit that was probably a bad example, because
I seldom found players that chose an ogre/troll to be lacking sense
of humor.

But my former guild-life has been f**ked up by people who were
taking themselves and the game too seriously, for example:
I talked to a friend in tells one day, and he told me "Hey, this
is the first time someone from the guild talks to me since I was
booted" and I went "What? you have been booted?"

Turns out he accidentally cursed in guild chat (against the rules)
when it was meant for group chat. Some leader took offense
and started a discussion.
I am not objecting to him getting the boot then, since it was not
without reasons. What I got upset about though, was that it had
been set immidiately: He was booted as a decision by the few
people online at the time, because they seemingly like the
power they had over him.

It wasn't at all mentioned on our messageboard, not even
in the officers section (I was an officer).

That's what made me start a discussion about it.
About a week or two later I also got the boot, but not for
violating any rules, but for criticizing the high council/guild leaders.

But that was one person's decision, one of the guild leaders
did it, and even my "worst opponent" in discussions got
upset about her not asking the others, and booting me at all.

So, one by one, people left the guild, and soon after it kind of
dissolved.
Why? Because one of the guild leaders was getting excited
about the "power" she had over others. That's kind of the same
what I think of people petitioning names that are violating
the policy yet not offending to anyone: Having the "power"
to ruin someone elses fun.

I wanted my name to hint at the way I am roleplaying
my character - turns out I did the opposite :)
Maliciosa would be evil, yet I play a "good" dark elf.
But that's also kind of fun.

Plus it would look silly...

> And so you have used some imagination

Well, I would certainly not retain to a misspelling, but
again, this is not the point of discussion :)

Ok, same with me - though I didn't yet have to petition any name.

Actually it's the word used by kids for another kid that runs
to the next grown up to tell him about whatever "evil" thing
some other kid has just done.

Yes it is: I do feel personally involved with the "misspelling" thing,
as I did get inspired by "Malice" or "Malicia" (german version in the books)
Not to mention my last name...

I have been using names I knew from books in RPGs at times,
like in AD&D, but I have also come up with a lot of names
on my own, so the lack-of-imagination-thing does not really
apply to me, thats why I feel offended by the suggestion.

I often sat a straight 10 minutes, stuck at the character
creation screen, to come up with a name I really liked
and that I did _not_ know from somewhere else, be it
a book, a film or a person in real life.
I just sat here, trying to come up with some example,
and as I followed the way of my thinking, I must say
that - regardless of the name someone chooses:
99 per cent of the time it WILL be inspired by some
name they already know.
It's very hard to come up with something on your own,
especially because there ARE so many names in the
world. First I just came up with was "Melian", until I
remembered that this was a maya from the Silmarillion.

Sialem, Tufor, Gonath, Meridea, those are all I can up
with at the moment, and they took me some 20 minutes,
to be honest - and I still find some 50 to 150 hits on them
on google (tried to verify their uniqueness with that).
Only one I didn't find a hit for was Fhandu, but that's probably
just due to the seemingly misplaced 'h' there, which is why I
didn't list it up there.
Am I freed of the charge of being unimaginative?

> care...the argument against..erm..read the rules sometime.

Well - I just think it's not an offense to the rules to NOT
petition someones name when it obviously(?) violates them.

Best Regards,


    Lars

PS: Sialem, Tufor, Gonath, Meridea, Fhandu, all (c) 2001, 2002 by ME now :)
    I rather like those names, and I'd rather keep my work :P
