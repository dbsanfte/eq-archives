Masterful use of copy-n-paste. Congrats.
Nicely top-posted as well.
There are two sets of rules. There's the set that you so cleverly 
copy/pasted, and there are those set by the players that are somewhat 
like 'good manners' in real life. The clods in the OP broke the second 
set by being doorknobs.
They're not real. They're not in writing, but the smooth functioning of 
a society depends on good manners just as much as it does the letter of 
the law. It's morons who believe the letter of the law excuses any sort 
of annoying behavior they want to engage in because it's not against the 
law, whether it's socially acceptable or not, that just get under my 
skin. The pinheads in the OP were those sort of people. They deserved 
what they got.

And in your little experiment with CTRL C & CTRL V, did you see a part 
that didn't also apply to the interlopers? Just because they weren't 
able to carry off what they intended to do doesn't mean they didn't try. 
The WANTED to do to him what he did to them. They just couldn't. They're 
not blameless innocents, they're pinheads.
