No you've gone farther than that. You've asserted that Graeme would 
RATHER be raped and strangled than have an opportunity to shoot her 
assailant. I'm sure Graeme would not RATHER that. And I'm sure nobody 
here can see how your conclusion followed from his statement.

Except that an 'outlaw' was a 'law abiding citizen' until he decided to 
commit a crime. And if he doesn't have a gun when he's a law abiding 
citizen, he's less likely to make an effort to get one when he decides 
to go to rob the 7-11. And if he's robbing the 7-11 with a hunting knife 
he's less likely and less able to kill everybody in the place.

Look at Canada. A comparatively unarmed population and far less murder 
and rape per capita...

In fact... look at the rest of the civilized world... most of it has gun 
laws and most of it has less violent crime than the U.S. per capita.

Watch 'Bowling for Columbine' its a nice documentary/movie on the 
subject, although I'm sure you'll call its liberal bullshit or somesuch 
while clucthing your gun under your pillow...

Face it... 'an armed population' in the US has not reduced violent crime 
in the US and it in fact has more violent crime than most of the 
developed world where guns are not permitted...

No matter how you want to cut it the facts simply do not support your 
theory.

Period.
