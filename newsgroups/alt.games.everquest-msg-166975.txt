PoP majorly speeds it up.  I whizzed through 57 compared to 55 or 56.  If I
go to a decent prePoP zone, like HS, or the Hole for xp, I can get maybe a
blue, grouped, for 2 hours in level 58.  If I go to PoN/PoD/PoI, in that
same time, I can easily get double or more that xp.  In both cases, this is
assuming far from ideal grouping, just grabbing friends of more or less
appropriate level.
