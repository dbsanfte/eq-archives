The ability to never have to rely on another class?  Yeah right

Whilst I don't have a druid, I do have a 60 shaman, and I think you sir, are
talking out of your ass

> 2b)When was the last time you saw a druid solo a dragon or rumblecrush ?

Whens the last time you saw ANY class solo rumblecrush?  lmao.  As for the
weak WW "dragons" (can you call them that) they have been solod by chanters,
shamans, bards, necros, a magician.. I bet theres a lot more classes that
have done it too

And druids have trouble getting to 60?  Lol please.
Soloing/quadding is on a par with most AE groups (exception would be
extremely efficient powerful ae'ers)

Whats that got to do with anything?  Knights, Monks, Rogues, Rangers.. they
all aren't NEEDED in groups.. does that mean my monk can get cheal too, to
"balance" my class?   lol
