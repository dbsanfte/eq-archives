I've never understood this one either. It doesn't bother me, really,
but it does rather baffle me. Especially the absurd ones like "Ding,
Level 2". BFD!

And shows a lack of respect. If you want *me* to take the time to do
something for you, you'd better spell out "please".

And on the flipside of this, don't get all knotted up if someone
killsteals the extremely common thing you're fighting, one time.
Accidents happen, and a single occurrence isn't worth announcing to
the zone or berating the other player about.

Amen. I'm amazed by the number of people who apparently cannot think
for themselves. If you're in South Karana, just where in the hell do
you *think* North Karana might be? Hmmm? Would you like us to chew
your food for you too?

I've never been able to agree with this one, and I still don't. The
Inspect function is a built-in part of the game. People who don't like
to be inspected can simply turn off the inspect message. Inspecting is
not even close to the same thing as a full body cavity search, and
people shouldn't react as if it were.
