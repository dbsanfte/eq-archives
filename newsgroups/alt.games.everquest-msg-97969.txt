John you have been reading my other replies haven't you ?
I do actually think that if they seriously cheepen the amount of effort
it takes to get to 60 that it will impact my enjoyment of the game. If
when I eventuall get to 60 (or even 40 for that matter) it is *much*
easier than it used to be then I will feel that I have not achieved as
much as older players. This will make it less fun for me.

(No I don't think that the current changes have done this, providing it
does take the same effort to reach 50 and they haven't just wiped hell
levels)

Well yes frankly. I am a casual player and I *only* spend 4 or 5 hours a
week playing.
Yes it will be a great acheivement for me to reach 60.
Not a great achievement like my son's first birthday or getting a pay
rise with the It market like it is, but yes a great acheivement none the
less.

My reason for playing the game is the same as yours FUN.
Part of the fun I have is the chalange of leveling.
If that chalange is significantly reduced so is my fun.

And if it becomes significantly easier to get to higher levels and cause
more greef in EQ would you expect to see :

1) more people like this
2) less people like this ?

Ok so I may have misspelled miniscutly, but you did get the meaning
didn't you ?
Do you disagree that the current changes have made it a tiny bit easyer
to get to level, oh lets say, 10 ?
