Yup, Feign Death is sweet.  I'll happily teach it to you as soon
as my monk learns Tracking....

(And as a side deal, I'll teach you Mend -- heal 25% of your hp
once per six minutes -- in return for you teaching me either SOW
or Gate. :-)

Heh, one of the reasons I started up a druid alt was so I'd have
someone I could send on errands.

Oh, and while we're on the subject, when does my Wizard get his
first healing spell?

Seriously, even though none of these abilities is unique to a
class or race, the fact that each class/race gets a different mix
of abilities is part of what keeps the game fresh (for those of us
who haven't been playing it for five years, anyway!), and also
encourages more player interaction.  Which is not to say that I
long for the days (which, thankfully, were before my time) when
melees had to beg for Binds, and stuff like that.  But I don't
mind the fact that each of my characters has different plusses
and minusses that I have to learn to deal with.

Just this weekend my wizard discovered the joys of Blackburrow
overpulls with no Feign Death to fall back on....
