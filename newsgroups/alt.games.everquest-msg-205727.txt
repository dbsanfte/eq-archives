Tag along on a Grummus kill, to get your flag for COD.

Sadly, even easier would be tag along on a POI Factory flagging
run, but that doesn't seem to get you a charm.

Passing a Trial in POJ would be pretty hard to arrange, you'd be
far more "dead weight" than the average person who did this once
upon a time, but if you have 5 levle 65 friends who for some
reason miss flagging people instead of having fun, go for it.

Once you get level for POS, the easiest flag in the game shows up;
BOT flag.  This is just a matter of getting some common loot drops
off exp group kills, plus a couple medallions off boss mobs; the
latter may be a bit harder to come by, but not a -lot- harder.

At any rate, of all the charms in the game, only the POP flag
reward one comes close to being both good and easy to get at the
same time.
