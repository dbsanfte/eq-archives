Lower delay weapon the less chance it has of proc'ing, saying this I
remember using 2 of them in mid twenties and keeping mobs almost perma
stunned, with less than 90 dex.
So no idea why you are not getting proc's, even off hand you would normally
get 1 a fight (they proc at level 25) try sticking in your primary hand and
beat on some greens, maybe the one you have has flat batteries? ;ï¿½)
