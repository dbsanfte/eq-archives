WIZ and Enchanter.   I have seen one couple like that and they are now
in the high 40's.  The main thing they lack is SOW and heal, that
happends anytime the enchater wants.  

Druid and Necro is just about unbeatable.  MOST necros fail to feed
the Druids mana.  I would say Necro and Shaman also but you get no
ports.

Warrior and cleric is your best bets for group and guild.
