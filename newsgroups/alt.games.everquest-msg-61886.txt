Axe of the iron back is a fine weapon for lvl 16. For mele classes, ac is
paramount, so Id be looking to improving your armor first. Trolls should be
able to wear large bronze. I know bronze drops in DL of the drolvargs, but
im not sure if its large bronze. If it is, then that would be the place to
check out. You could also get quite a bit of fine plate made up for that. A
lumberjacks cap (giants in kunark) is good cheap ac for the head.
