I don't have a problem with not having normal pet commands, but I do
think enchanters should be able to command their pets to attack.  Just
have it aggro on whatever you have targeted when you hit attack.  Make
it so you couldn't call the pet off after that just so it's not to
imbalancing.

Hell, enchanters are suppose to be able to summon these things to
fight for them.  Giving them a LITTLE offensive ability, rather than
just attacking when the enchanter is attacked, would be handy I think.
