Just have someone send you their Everquest.exe, kpatch.exe, and vpatch.exe
(if you have Kunark/Velious) then you can download the whole thing from the
patch server.  Now let me address all the inevitable replies of idiots
bitching at me.  1. This is not illegal if he is telling the truth.  2.
People who don't legally own EverQuest and do this cannot play since they
will not have an account or CD key to start a new account.
