A solution like this does nothing. The problem has to be addressed at
the source, from the beginning. This would do nothing to improve the
game for those who prefer a world vs an arcade game, and do nothing
but annoy those who believe in the opposite. In effect, your solution
does absolutely nothing for anyone.

"Bad enough when the dead come walking," he said to Jon as they crossed
 the village, "now the Old Bear wants them talking as well? No good will
 come of *that*, I'll warrant. And who's to say the bones wouldn't lie?
 Why should death make a man truthful, or even clever? The dead are likely
 dull fellows, full of tedious complaints - 'the ground's too cold, my
 gravestone should be larger, why does *he* get more worms than I do....'"
