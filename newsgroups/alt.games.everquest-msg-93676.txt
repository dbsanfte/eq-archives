Rumbledor,
Spell gems...

Our role is mostly crowd control and buffing. This changes little up
thru the levels. Just our tools change.
 We get upgrades to spells we already have and a few more but mostly
all in the same vein.

My spell line up has changed little since my early 20's and I would
say it should apply to you at 12

At 12 mine looked like this

Stun
Mesmerise
Tash
Root
Swap slot
Swap slot
Swap slot
Swap slot

What to put in swap slots?
I put spells that are appropriate for the situation such as:
Charm 
Nuke
DoT
Pet
Fear
Gate
Some buffs or debuffs

A good place to look is at Eugee's site

Good luck and Have fun
