Looks like a Velious spell for wizards. The wurms in the Great Divide and
lots of MoBs in Skyshrine should drop it randomly. Get in a group in GD in
lower levels and move to SS in higher levels if you have not found it yet.
Auction your tail off for it in those zones and be sure to check the vendors
in Thurgadin for it. Someone may have sold it to a vendor not wanting to
deal with locating a wizard to buy it.
