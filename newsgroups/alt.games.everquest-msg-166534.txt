There is a flaw in your logic regarding this.  Not that capitalism is
great, there's no argument there.  Simply that EQ is representative of
this form of economy.

Not that this isn't a great learning tool for younger minds, it is.
But a few things you mentioned don't hold true.

The supply in this world is infinite.  I know that certain items are
difficult to acquire, but they can always be acquired.  There is no
finite limit to any resources in this game.  Consider the bone chip
analogy.  You can farm skeletons all day long and still they'll be
spawning waiting to serve up some more.  In the RW we would drive them
to extinction, making the resource priceless.  People pay 3-5pp for a
stack because they value their time more than the pp, but make no
mistake, the second they felt it was more economical for them to do it
themselves the price would drop to squat.  So this is an example of
the economics of time, not supply and demand.

Same goes for all the items.  Do you remember how difficult it was to
get a Stein of Maggok 3 years ago?  When I started those things were a
casters dream and would sell for 500+pp.  Now you can get them for
less than 50p and they will never go back up simply because the supply
is infinite.

I'll reiterate, no argument that capitalism works, and that this game
has many aspects of it built in.  But you can't have a pure
capitalistic game unless you restrict the number of customers in order
to place limits on resources.  Something no true capitalist would ever
do... ;-]
