"Complained" suit your sensibilities better?

The reason I went with "whine" is that the majority of the things you 
didn't like were -perfectly reasonable- as game features. There may have 
been implementation issues (e.g. the lighting discussion elsewhere in 
this thread), but the idea that some races can see in the dark, and some 
can't isn't a bad idea.

There -should- be caves in a game that humans can't see around in 
without a light source. And given that both human newbie areas had 
firebeetles, getting a functional lightsource was trivially easy.

The -vision- was fine, the reality that video cards handled lighting all 
differently, gamma setting issues, and limitations of the lighting model 
itself however all took their toll...

But even for all that I -liked- not being able to see at night. That 
added something. I remember pulling to near the guard towers in the 
Karana's because I couldn't see well, and they were lighted landmarks.
