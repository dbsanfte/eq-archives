Wow, someone else remembers that steaming pile of tripe. Funnily enough, 
this whole issue put me in mind of that film too - I was wracking my brains 
trying to remember some film I'd seen about 20 years ago right in the 
middle of the great D&D witchhunt (personally I always preferred Call of 
Cthulu - if religious nuts are going to accuse roleplayers of being in 
league with dark forces may as well give them some real meat to chew on). 
Never realised that was Tom Hanks though, I guess he wasn't too famous in 
1982...

If anyone's interested there's some reviews of this timeless classic at:
http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/MazesandMonsters-1017854/preview.php

(review quotes:  "There are few greater thrills than watching a really 
famous person suck hard."...  " See Tom and friends play thier game in a 
really lame cave dressed as reject Rennaissance Festival rat catchers."...)


In case anyone else (apart from me) wants to rush out and buy the video, 
its still available from amazon:
