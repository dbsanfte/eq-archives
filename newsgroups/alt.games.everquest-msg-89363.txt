I think you can just use the spell 'Gather Shadows' and travel invisible.

It's more about not being killed or inadvertantly killing something you
shouldn't. Just don't kill any human type creatures and travel invisible
while building faction.

Kill the Orcs in the commons, lots and lots of them. *DON'T* kill them in a
place where they don't give factions like the Desert of Ro, you really need
to kill that many faction giving ones.

Sometime about level 12 you can take a long -invisible- run to Blackburrow.
Follow the same routine with killing gnolls there. Save the gnoll fangs to
turn into Captain Tillin and turn the moonstones he gives you into McNeal
Jacob for faction and coin.

You can kill bandits some time around this stage. You will probably be a bit
to high for them to give you experience, but they give good faction with the
Karana residents. It's hard to get a bandit group together, so you have to
be a bit higher then them anyway.

Next stage would probably be Highpass gnoll and Orc killing.

You would be about level 20 by now and able to travel fairly widely. With a
level 20 pet, you could probably clear up any other factions you need just
by crushing some low level mobs. For instance, to build Tunare and a few
other runt factions you can kill aqua goblins. You should be able to sneak
into Misty Thicket and rock the gobbie camps for halfling faction. My guess
would be about 4 nights of no experience killing to get faction for most
areas.
