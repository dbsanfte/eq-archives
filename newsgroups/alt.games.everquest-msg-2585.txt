Hmm.  A $1500 laptop was stolen from my room on Thursday.  Obviously the 
thief didn't care whether or not he might lose my respect either.  Yeah, 
geez, sucks to be him.  Good to know we're all at least 3000 miles away 
from you.  Given the geographic distribution of EQ players, where's that 
put you?  The center of the earth?

}It was a real tough choice with the "video game respect" meaning
}absolutely nothing and all.

Means nothing to you, maybe.  I've made several friends in there who do 
show me respect, and may continue to be my friends even if one of us were 
to quit the game.  It's a shame you missed out on that experience.
