This may be something that they are tweaking during the beta. I've come 
across a few trapped chests while soloing, but not enough to be able to 
assess the relative frequency. It would make sense to have fewer traps for 
soloers who have a very high probabilty of having no Scout available to 
Disarm! You certainly shouldn't die from setting off a trap that you have no 
possibility of disarming.
