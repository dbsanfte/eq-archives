Trials are a special sort of event in PoJ, not a normal raid at all, closer to the
"circles" in some pre PoP zones.

You say a trigger phrase, and your group gets ported to a seperate room where you have
to defend a prisoner by one means or another, basically deciding his guilt or
innocence (the old way, where if he dies, he must have been guilty)

The trial most people do is the Trial of Execution, in this, 4 mobs pop, and you must
kill one in 30 seconds to stop an executioner (untargetable mob) from killing the
prisoner (also untargetable).  Each time you kill one, another executioner starts
walking.  Stop all four, you get a brief pause, then another wave of four.  Pass four
waves, a boss mob "executioner" pops, kill him and you've won the case.  Loot a mark
off his body, and you can get a flag for the second tier planes.

In addition to that flag, apparantly if you finish all the trials you can get flagged
for yet another plane of some sort.

I've referred to a vaguely similar event in PoN as a trial, even though its not a
court case or anything of the sort, I'm just referring to the fact that its a closed
event with limited participation which is done to get a flag.  Probably not a good use
of the word.
