Well... in all honesty... I don't think I really figued out what mez was 
for until level 18-20ish.  Mostly because up to that point, I'd mostly 
soloed, since finding a group was a massive pain in the butt. I mean... 
root is so much better, it didn't break just because some dorky tank hit 
the mob... It even has a small chance of sticking if I nuke!  You coulda 
tried explaining it to him, it might be his first character after all.

The pet part is a bit suprising... I think I mostly thought my job was 
mana regen and occassional nukage.  Still, if you don't want to teach 
people how to group, you might want to try somewhere that isn't Oasis.
