Well, what I have on my 38 enchanter is this:

wrists: junk, usually Polished Bone Bracelets or self-jewelled CHA bracers.

Hands: Incandescent Gloves (easy quest at your level in the temple of Sol 
Ro, may as well get the mask and rod of insidious glamour while you're at 
it).

Feet: Had Crystal lined slippers (dirt cheap, 3 INT), now have spider fur 
boots (CHA and hp)

Primary Hand: Varies between Staff of Ethereal Energy (quite cheap 
nowadays) 12 INT 2HB staff with resists etc, and rod of insidious glamour 
(CHA, and right-clicky alliance, easy quest at your level).

Range: Had the Seal of Thoridain (Thurgadin Baking quest, 3INT and 
resists/mana), then a preserved owlbear eye (4 INT mana and resists, easy 
camp in Hollowshade at your level), then a purified crystal dagger (CHA and 
resists. Crystallized shadow dagger drops in TOFS then you need someone who 
has done the Stonebrunt quest to purify it into something worth having).

Head: Runed Circlet.
