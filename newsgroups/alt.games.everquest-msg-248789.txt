I last logged in last Friday or so, maybe this weekend.  At the time, I had
right about 6k in the bank, give or take a couple hundred plat.

I logged in today after the patch, with the new bank window--my plat is
gone.  JUST my plat.  My characters remain untouched, they have all their
plat (one had several hundred on her) and all their loot, and my gold,
silver and copper are still in my shared bank.  *Only* the plat is gone.  No
one else has my password, and it's a "complex" password, not easily guessed.
I'm virus free and all that, I checked.  I've checked all my characters and
none are holding it.

Needless to say, I'm petitioning.  I doubt I'll get satisfacation, though it
hurts (in more than one way) because that represents at least *six months*
of work for me.  (I don't get to hunt much, so every plat counts.)

Has anyone else had this happen?
