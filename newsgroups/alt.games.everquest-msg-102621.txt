Thousands of violent crimes are prevented each year by responsible gun
owners (the majority of these encounters never require a shot to be
fired). The general media will never cover these events, because they
are biased on the issue.

The predators in our society are generally cowards. When thay are
faced with a victim that is willing and able to fight back, most will
turn tail and run. The ones that stand thier ground are the most
dangerous and deserve whatever happens to them.

As long as criminals have access to guns, law abiding citizens will be
forced to arm themselves for protection. That is a fact of life. No
matter how "civilized" we become, dangerous "animals" will continue to
walk among us.
