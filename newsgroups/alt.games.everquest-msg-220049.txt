Sounds like my boycotting of STTNG for the few two years
just because I was being 'loyal'. I'm still catching an
episode or two here and there that I've never seen before.

As far as B5 characters, it's difficult to decide which
one I liked the best. G'Kar, Londo, Vir, Marcus (what a
babe!) are all right up there. But.....I gotta say, the
shows with Zathros in them, I *love*. I always mangle
his lines, but he's got some great ones.

'There are many Zathros. There's Zathros. And Zathros.
And Zathros...I don't like him much.'

'Zathros has lived a cold and lonely life. He will
probably die a cold and lonely death. There is
symmetry in that.'

<nodding head emphatically up and down> No, Zathros
not understand. Zathros do, but Zathros not understand.'
