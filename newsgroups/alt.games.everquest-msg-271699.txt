...aren't as considerable. Both are doing the realism 'thing'. And Doom3 
does it with more candy effects: more light sources/fog effects/moving 
coloured lights/ bump mapping textures/ etc/ etc /etc  than EQ2 does.

And if you beleive that ... I'll sell you a bridge in London. (Although 
I'll admit I can't sell it to you today, because the payment system I'm 
using is currently down for upgrades.)

Cuz WoW's engine has been carved into stone tablets and cannot be 
updated. Surely you're aware how mmorpgs evolve?

Basing 'Holding up better' on what we can see today would only be 
relevant if they weren't both continually improving.

 
> I'm not saying this is an advantage or disadvantage for EQII.

Its a clear disadvantage that potential customers can't run it. The 
hypothetical advantage two years from now is far enough away that EQ2s 
engine coming into its own is irrelevant. WoW could have an update that 
leapfrogs EQ2 in the meantime completely mitigating it.

What will matter in the -long- run is scalability/upgradability. And 
even if we agreed that EQ2 started out prettier, I'd put my money on the 
blizzard horse for the long haul. 

But regardless of my personal opinion, there is simply no way to gauge 
scalability/upgradeability by looking at what we can see of the existing 
engines.

Nobody ever said you did. Guilty conscious bugging you? :)
