Also, the way the server determines whether you moved is by comparing
the starting position of a cast with the position you're in when it
ends. On a long casting spell, you could start the cast, run in a
circle, and as long as you end up exactly where you started the cast
will complete. Try it started in a corner of 2 walls sometime, it works.
