Even OT posts should have some basic relevance if nothing more than a 
solicitation of the views of the a.g.e. community on a given outside 
subject.

I contributed as best I could to the OP's question, but the fact of the 
matter is the post doesn't belong in this group. It is a general CoH 
question, not even a CoH as it relates to a.g.e. folk question.

With all the drivel found on Usenet, it is nice to know you can go to a 
particular group and have it filtered in a meaningful fashion. Technically 
this post goes against that.

For now, you can try visiting the following. It's in its infancy, but there 
are some nice folks there who are willing to help.
