LOL, you can't stop a monk from pulling EVER!  they are nutso about it. 
   You did the right thing, you told him you needed sleep and at least 
you waited till the end of one fight to disband.  Not your fault any 
dumb things he did after you disbanded so don't worry about him anymore.

Suggestion for future...Marus Seru and Netherbian lair.  Good XP from 25 
to 30.  After that Dawnshroud is fun.

Good luck
