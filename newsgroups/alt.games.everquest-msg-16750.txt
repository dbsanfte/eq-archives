If you are on Xev, stay where you are, my halfling druid will be right over as
soon as I get home from work :-)

Otherwise, your best bet would be a teleport to to West Commons, then a fast
run to the tunnel in East Commons. Try North Qeynos; many half elf and all
human druids start in the Qeynos area, so you might find a mid level tailor
wanting to make reinforced leather. Otherwise, just sell it to a merchant.
