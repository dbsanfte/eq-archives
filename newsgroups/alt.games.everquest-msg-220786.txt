And yet, the US has a *much* higher murder and rape rates than Western 
Europe. How is that possible, if the European populace is so defenceless? 
It looks like if your mom wants to avoid being raped and strangled with 
her own pantyhose, she'd do well moving over here, or stop wearing 
pantyhose.

PS. I'm sick to the pit of my stomach of gun control debates. I'm happy 
for the US to have whatever gun laws it sees fit; I only snap when 
someone comes up with the idea of trying out the same over here, 
especially if that someone has already shown in the past a comical 
ignorance about Europe.
