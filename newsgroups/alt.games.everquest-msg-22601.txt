Hmm, the reason for the relative levels of happiness seems pretty clear to
me:
Sang's guild: 1 Shaman buffing 30+ people for a raid. "Unhappy Buffmonkey"
DKs guild: 5 Shamen sharing the load. "happy Buffmonkies".
Anyhoo they are far from just buff-monkeys. Sure, there is little they can
do about the magic-immune bossmobs, but there is a lot more to a raid than
just the big fight at the end and I notice a lot of our "useless classes"
like Shamans, Druids, Enchanters, SKs all get plenty to do, some of it
highly specialised, and they seem to have fun. Heh I've got one friend (in a
different guild) toying with the idea of retiring his 60 Warrior so he can
play his 60 Necro more at raids because "it's less stress to just sit there,
dump mana on a cleric then go afk and come back to loot" :)
