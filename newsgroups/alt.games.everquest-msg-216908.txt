The clerics in this thread have never said they know pulling- they have 
said they know pull rates. Split however you want, path however you want, 
tag however you want, but for gods sake listen to the cleric.

Gee, I have this knowledge and, aside from clipping through walls, I can't 
think of how it could possibly help you figure out if something will aggro 
through the wall.

I say 20m sometimes at 19m. Likewise, I say 20m when at 21m sometimes.

Sometimes I'll say it at 30m, just so morons like you won't pull when I 
really *am* at 20m.
