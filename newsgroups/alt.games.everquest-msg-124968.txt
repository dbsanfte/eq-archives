    I don't think he's talking about fear-kiting here, but when mobs try and
flee near the end of combat. The canonical example I think of for this is
fighting at the zone in Dalnir - the mobs run right to the wall beside the
zone line and keep running into it if you keep hitting them. You actually
cannot stop them from doing this if you fight at zone. As a GM, my ruling
would be that as long as you weren't using that feature to fear kite
indoors, it would not be an exploit. You can't tell if a player is doing it
on purpose, and to me intent is a big part of the exploiting rules.

    This also depends on circumstances. Remember the "I jump across the
moat" issue? I would argue that as long as the path the mob takes is
rational, there's no exploit. If, on the other hand, he's moving back and
forth against the wall in High Keep guard room to make the goblin run all
the way around the room - pure exploit, bust his ass.

    Assuming they actually bust you, sigh. I've reported people nuking
guards from the High Keep ledge back when stuff couldn't get up there - no
action taken. I've reported a necromancer that was using the slide against
the High Keep guard room wall technique to fear kite without the Fear - no
action taken. I've reported a bard that was exploiting the entryway leading
into Karnor's (used to be able to run back and forth against one wall and
nothing could get to you) - no action taken. The only action I've ever seen
taken was that eventually, some of these pathing wonders were eliminated.
