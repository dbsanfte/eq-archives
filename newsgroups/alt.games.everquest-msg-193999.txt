    The res timer will expire on a duel-created corpse before it graveyards.
That's the real issue with a duel-and-drag - the ressers on the other end
have to click the body ASAP. Five minutes, including time to zone, consent
the rogue, and get the body dragged to camp, is fairly tight.

    I'm sitting at over 3900 HPs completely unbuffed, and about 1300 AC.
Yes, unless I sit down it takes a while to kill me. Monual isn't up that
high yet, but he's getting there.
