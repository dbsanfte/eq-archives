Good choice, you will want at least 1GB for running EQ2 well.

I run with a 128MB ATi Radeon 9800 Pro, and it works well at the default 
setting for performance vs quality.  I believe the 5600 performs somewhat 
less well than my card, but not by a huge amount.

For comparison, my system:

Asus A78NX-E Deluxe Motherboard
Athlon XP 3200+ processor
NVidia NForce2 Ultra chipset
1GB PC3200 Ram
ATi Radeo 9800 Pro 128MB (Built by Sapphire) video card

I have heard the same regarding WoW, I would expect that you would have 
no problems at all running it from everything I have heard.
