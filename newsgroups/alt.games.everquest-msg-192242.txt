As someo who is new to EQ and playing a bard, this is the first I've
heard of this.

I vaguely understand Peridots as being a gem-like you can buy from
merchants.

Are you saying that clerics (others) consume peridots when they rezz or
cast bluffs?

Is there a list of spells/buffsa that I should offer a peridot for?

Is this a similar reason for an iksar monk asking me to buy 2 stacks of
jade for them?
