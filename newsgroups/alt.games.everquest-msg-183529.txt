Ok,

I'm a fairly new to EQ (Bout a month) - Lvl 29 Bard.  Haven't been too far
really.  Kelethin / Kaladim / Rivervale / BB / Unrest / HHP / HHK etc
Sent a guild msg last night asking for someone to guide me to Katta
Castellum as I needed to buy a few songs that I could only get there as lag
was quite bad and ruled out fighting.
Anyhow, I got a tell saying to meet them in the Nexus - so off I go.
First I'm led to some strange portal I've never used before, then led
through a wall (like the PoK book in Freeport) or two, then through this
strange place with psychodelic mushrooms that try grabbing you..... then
through this other weird strange zone with a town in it but also huge insect
looking bugs, then through what looked like a StarGate to the roof of a
castle.
After this I was lead across a sea to an Island where I got killed by a
shade of some sort.  EEEK!!!

This is where I got lost in what happened next and would like explaining how
it all works....

Anyhow the msg went out to the guild for help and they killed a +45 guild
member for a gem of somesort that gave me a rezz (93%!! - I'm used to 10 or
20!!)  What's with this member slaying??!!
Made me extremely grateful to my guild though...... Nice aren't they?

This took a while and the "wife faction" came into play (I had to log
ASAP!!) so I got dragged close to a zone line (Short walk across sea) to
Katta Castellum and rezzed.  Lag was so bad by this time that I couldn't
loot my body and had to camp - so hopefully I can loot and zone easily
enough.

Is Katta Castellum safe enough for a Half Elf Bard or should I stay invis?
Hopefully I'll find someone there that can gate me back to Nexus after
buying my songs....... (Oh, is there a bank there - took enough pp for
myself but think I'll buy my friends the songs too so they don't have to go
through that journey yet!! ?)

Overall a quite scarey trip that has shown me how much of EQ I have yet to
see...... Yrs worth of playing I suspect.  Any idea how long Sony plan to
keep EQ running?

Rgds,

Thomas.
