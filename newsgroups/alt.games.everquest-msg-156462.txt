Any spell you target on yourself will hit you (well there
are some rare exceptions)

AoE is Area of Effect... spells that hit their target and
anything else standing nearby.  If you cast one of these
spells on a target very close to you, you will also hit
yourself.  On standard servers, you will not hit other
players with this sort of spell.  Most of this sort
of spell hits a maximum of 4 targets, a few hit 5, all
have fairly tight radii, some smaller than others.

There is a special subset of the AoE spell, PB AoE
(for Point Blank) which are not targetted, but instead
cast with you as the center of the spell radius, these
spells do not hit you, and do hit an unlimited number
of targets if you can get them all to stand very close
to you.
