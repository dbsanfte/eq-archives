Hmmm, I thought this was normal, I have often noticed that you appear to
move slower in some zones, WK and SK being the two most noticable. I just
thought it was in the code to try and get across the immense size of the
zone that they couldn't do any other way. I certainly still see this with
SoW from QH to WK...the change in speed always makes me check that I haven't
hit run/walk in error.
