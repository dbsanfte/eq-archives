Fear not, the addiction will arise soon enough.  It honestly takes a while
at first and I would guess you might even strongly dislike the game the
first 10 levels of the first character you play.  I started with a Dwarven
Cleric and played up to 10 over the course of a few weeks and never found my
groove.  I was pretty much sure that I was going to quit the game after the
first month and forget it, but then I switched servers and began a Human
Warrior.  Not too popular a class/race combo but I've been hooked since.
Well, there are phases when you are bored with the game and feel like
everything is a chore, but I am just playing with a new Paladin for the
moment until I want to go back to my Warrior.  The main problem is that
travel is slow unless you got extra PP to spare for a port and that
sometimes deters me from playing.
