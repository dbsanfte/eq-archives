If you're looking for most damage and asking for VoG with a 34% haste item
you're seriously confused.

Haste percentages are, by definition, a percentage increase in damage.  So
that part is very easy to figure out.

Now let's look at raw ATK.

SoV = 41 ATK
VoG = 15 ATK
Monk epic = 52 ATK
SoT (ranger buff) = 60 ATK

So, you choose (52 + 15) 67 ATK and 93% haste instead of (41 + 60) 101 ATK
and 100% haste.

Seems like an odd choice if you're going for the most damage.

WR and SoT even would only be a 7 ATK difference.  Since we already know
that haste percentage is, by definition, a percentage of damage increase,
you'd trade 7 percent damage for 7 ATK.  So, 1 ATK = 1 percent damage? 
You'll have a hard time trying to prove that one.
