Well I asked me friends...the Xbox Live apparently does ofer this sort
of thing already. However in this specific case (and presumably the
Virtuality) there is a significant hardware piece that may do al ot of
the work once the modulation option is set. 
However they did say that the CPU power needed to do a consistent
modulation would not be very high at all if you had a system that was
already parsing sound. MIght hit the server heavil unless you designed it
carefully with the number of people potentially involved.
