Alas, autoequip only works in the 'inventory screen', or at least it only
did a few months ago when I was playing with it.
I was working on some wierd mod ('moving' the inventory screen to the buff
box, and the buff box to the inventory screen, then making the entire new
buff box auto equipable) but stopped fiddling with it as too difficult.
