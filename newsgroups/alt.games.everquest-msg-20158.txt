Oh, that's how I use it, too, but I just see way too many people who seem to
think it's cool to call druids, "dr00ds."  It's not.  Dr00d is a serious
insult (IMO) and anyone STUPID enough to call me a dr00d will never receive
help from me.

I think people who call dwarves "dorfs" haven't gotten the clue yet that the
joke was old a year ago and no longer even approaching humorous.  My brother
has currently "quit" EQ and since I've been paying for it all year I've
taken over it, and his 57 dwarf cleric.  I find myself less than eager to
rez people who haven't gotten the clue yet.

"Chanter."  Hmmm, slightly more likely to be ignored by me than someone who
knows my primary character's class (enchanter).  Not quite a peeve, just a
minor annoyance...I mean, come on...add the 2 easy letters.
"Crack dealer."  Much more likely to be ignored.  Again, IT ISN'T FUNNY
ANYMORE.  That's giving it the benefit of the doubt saying that it was EVER
funny....
