So, would it have been creating drama if, during down time or buff time,
someone had started a friendly /ooc chat about current movies, which would
of course lead to discussion of "The Cat in the Hat" movie, which is
currently showing up in the bottom 100 of all time on IMDB, so that all that
bad things you might say about CiH would really (*nudge* *nudge* *wink*
*wink*) be about the movie? :-)
