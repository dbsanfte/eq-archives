Kinda a rant.

Just exited the bazaar and was gonna camp in the corner there in the
nexus. I sit, hit camp. With about 5 seconds left I noticed some level
21 druid asking me for buffs and he then sends me a tell saying "fag".
Zap I am camped.

Now I don't mind buffing people, and have actually gone out of my way
at times to help others - it is just my nature in the game. But to
start calling someone names because they did not noticed you begging
for buffs is not a way to make friends.

I logged back on and proceeded to ask him what he was so upset about,
and that I was logging when he asked and didn't see his request till
too late. He claims I ran by him and ignored him. Still is that the
way you treat someone for not buffing you? Ever think that someone is
afk - (yes even though they just zoned from the most populated zone in
the game). Needless to say, Danum who is on the Quellious server will
be added onto my ignore list, and I hope others won't tollerate this
kind of disrespect. I know, normally something like this I would have
just ignored but I've actually never had this happen. Have had it
happen where I ask for a buff and that person logs or ignores (or is
afk), but I don't call them names for it. GRRR
