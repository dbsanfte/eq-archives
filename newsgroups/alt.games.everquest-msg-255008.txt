It might well be a level thing. At lower levels (say, below 30), the traps
are notorious for wiping entire parties in 2 ticks or less. With my mid
30's cleric though, if I was fully prepped for it, I could keep myself
alive and maybe 1 or 2 others, depending on how many hps they had.

And it's *possible* to be out of range of a trap. I've done it. Took a
wrong turn after we'd cleared the dungeon. And other folks wanted to open
a chest while I was *way* far away. Whatever, your funeral. No big surprise,
the trap went off, and everybody else died. I wasn't in range though.
