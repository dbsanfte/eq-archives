Do you think it would be worth it for an enchanter? I like the med
with no aggro component but being an enchanter sometimes requires some
quick maneuvering for me to be selective about which mob im gonna mezz
in a fight. The big dumb ogre, troll and barbarian warriors are in my
line of sight a lot so I gotta be swift about targetting. That isnt
going to be accomplished so easy on a horse. Its great for my solo
kiting wizard but in a dynamic group like that, targetting for an
enchanter is definatly an issue. Clerics just target the MA or keep
watch on group bars....enchanters have a lot more work.

oh and by the way....my 20th level enchanter HAS been begged for KEI
before. Verant please put a level limit on KEI...like it wont affect
anyone under 51st level. I did snicker and cast breeze on the beggar
and they didnt know what breeze was. They wanted KEI. OMG....just
shoot me.
