one piece of advice,  if you arent going to use the whole HDD,  dont buy one
that big, just a waste of money,  hell. i have a 20gig, and have never used
it all.  but then again  seom people can fill up 80gigs fast, on the HDD
more gigs doesnt always mean better,  try to get a western digital, and
find the highest rpm in the size HD you are looking for. and keep the 2100
ram
and that video card that comes with the system should do you damn good :)
