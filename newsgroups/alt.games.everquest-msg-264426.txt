I wonder how WoW's graphics will appeal to me when I actually play.  The EQ2
graphics looked so  nice in screen and vid caps, yet they did have the same
appeal to me when I actually played the game.  There were a couple of "Oh
Ah" moments, but, while I recognize the technical quality of EQ2's graphics,
I don't find them engrossing.  Meanwhile, the WoW graphics that I see in
screenshots and vids generally don't make my heart beat faster.  Will I find
the actual game more appealing?  I'll see in a few months, I suppose.
