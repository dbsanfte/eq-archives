Of course, you can check the lfg tool every few minutes to find more. It 
beats OOC... barely. (depending on its usage level.)

That's true, but I've never understood why. The LFP tool was in some 
ways better than LFG. Someone could login, check the LFP, and fire off a 
tell to join a group... instead of passively waiting to get picked up. 

It was also more effective, because asking to join a group is far more 
likely to get you into a group then waiting to be asked, just in 
general, especially for more generic "dps/utility" classes... like 
bards, rogues, necros, mages, druids, ... anyone but clerics really 
;)... they get tapped for group invites even when they're obviously busy 
to anyone with half a brain. "Hi there, I failed completely to see that 
your non-anon cleric is in an instanced raid zone. Want to join a BoT 
group??"

For my part I would often see people wandering around passively LFG but 
didn't need them and didn't care enough to ask them join. But if they 
actually came up and politely asked to join, or even just sent a tell... 
I almost never turned someone down.
