Well I am not so sure about a low percentage of fast typists.

My 4 children aged 7 to 14 have been taking keyboarding since grade 1. Well
the oldest since grade 4. But any way, they all type extremely fast. It is
amazing. Mind you I am an old 2 finger plunker that can get a few fingers
moving but *slowly*. Speed and their spelling have nothing in common.

All that aside. I see an odd expletive hitting the screen accidentally but
not a sentence.
Everyone is responsible for what they say do or type whatever the reason.
