Chief whateverhisname is (Only one named "Chief <something>"). He's
one of the Othmir (So, if you've been killing Othmir, you're outta
luck until you fix faction) down by the shore in one of the shell
huts. Either invis and run or make sure your Claws of Veeshan faction
is cool, because the Wyverns and Drakes in the area are on that
faction. Drakes drift by the port-in now and then and are pretty nasty
I hear (Never fought one myself).
