bards dont get a failed message.
If you go invis. charm is broken. period.
if charm wasnt breaking for you, you werent hidden/invis.
ANY kind of inivs works.. invis to animals, undead, hide etc.
And yes, invis song.
I have never ever ever had problems with it, charming extensively,
and i read up on bard forums a ton on charm, and in 2 years have never
ever heard of it not working this way.

This is the way it works.

Now the question is, why are you not going invis when you think you are?
