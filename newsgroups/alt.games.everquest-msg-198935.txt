A person who can afford a fifty-dollar dinner can afford better than a
fifteen-cent tip.  I wasn't irritated by the level 12 druid who could only
offer me a half-stack of foraged vegetables; it's the level 60 mage with
epic who's handing me a stack of summoned water.  (Given how long it takes
to forage vegetables, I thought the druid was most generous!)  A stack of
summoned water is valuable to someone who can't get water on their own - but
a level 60 enchanter can usually find a gold or two.  Handing me a stack of
water wasn't buffing in return; it was taking advantage of the wording I
used to get something for (practially) nothing.

I never pretended to be anything other than a KEI vendor in that mode.  Why
would I ask for donations if I didn't intend to get something out of it?
I'd just say 'Free KEI, make a group and hail me' if I wasn't interested in
profit.

Oh, and a last point - I wasn't complaining, though when re-reading my post
I can understand why you might think so.  I was presenting a different point
of view.  It's very common to come to the Usenet threads and see people
bashing enchanters for selling KEI and setting a price for it instead of
doing it for 'donations.'  I wanted to give reasons WHY enchanters set a
price.
