I took them individually till 34, then once I picked up Lightning Strike I
used them to teach myself to quad.  At 36 the XP started getting a little
slow, but the camp is a druid's dream ... lots of room to kite, static
spawns, really good loot.  I banked when I got encumbered to the point that
Strength of Stone wasn't helping, and I never banked less than 85 plat when
I went in.

At 37 they started going cyan, so I pulled up.  Spent a little time in EW,
but the Ulthorks are so overcamped (on CT, anyway) that they couldn't be
quadded ... druids tripping over themselves.  The drolvargs in FV are pretty
much untouched ... it seems that nobody hunts much in the zone, they just
use it to get to LOIO.
