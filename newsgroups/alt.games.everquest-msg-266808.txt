I have redeemed them in game.
When I put them on I get an icon to indicate that I have put them on.
The icon when examined says it gives a boost to running speed. (as opposed 
to sprinting speed or walking speed)
I run in a straight line and take them off and put them on repeatedly but 
damned if I can see a difference.

Am I insane or do they do nothing perceivable?
