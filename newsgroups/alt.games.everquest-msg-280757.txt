Make ships working again,link ship trips with quests and tasks.
Make quests more transparent,easy to do just add a little hint
on quest item description what it is good for.
Add some mid level Ldons,oh wait then there would be no need
for DoN.  :p
Make zones more dynamic,war style events like the last ones or
the  FV/DL ones with fixed end are stupid and boring.Make it so
that the results can differ from server to server,e.g. one server
has GFay overtaken by Orcs on an other it is still in the hands of
elves.Depending on how much Orcs or Elves are killed the owner
ship of zone may change.Would be very interesting to see,what
happens when one cannot enter his home zones.

Well,one can always dream,but probably we will get another round
of unbalancing items with absurd stats with next expansion,cause
higher numbers sell sooo well,or where do the increased numbers
of subscribers come from?  :p
