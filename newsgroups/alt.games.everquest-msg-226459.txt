Unfortunately post-60 it's not the same as 1-60.

From 1-60 it's player_level * 3/4 rounded down
for DB and player_level * 2/3 rounded down for Cyan.

At 60 a level 45+ mob is DB, 40-44 is Cyan.

However, at 65 the DB range is 50-65 is DB,
45-49 is LB

So, it's possible that they simply hold the 15 level
difference from 60-65.
