Humm, haven't you ever noticed how everyone else in every job you have
ever held always manages to make 6 figures? 

Apart from IT consultants who are always telling you they made 6 figures
last year (whilst wearing threadbare suits and showing losts of nervous
twitches), every one who is successful must make at least 6 figures. In
fact 6 figures is passe these days. I need 6 figures to retire and not
live in poverty.

Yes, someone local did make 6 figures plus from maccas. He owed quite a
few franchises. Oh sorry, you said work!
