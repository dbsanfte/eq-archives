To get SK quest armor pieces head shout from Wizzie port pyramid to lizard
ritualist room (small pyramid/shrine with lizzie and pet). If ritualist is
up kill him as he usually drops 2 pieces for SK armor. His respawn time is
around 2 hours so you can beat him again after you have camped crusaders at
archon temple.
