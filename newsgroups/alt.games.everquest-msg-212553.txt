According to his logic, the 24 years I spent playing organized
basketball are immoral.  One result of those years is a right knee
with a ruptured ACL, partially torn MCL and a chunk out of my 
meniscus the size of my thumb.  

I accepted that risk every time I got on the court.  I also 
accepted the risk of damage to my vision (people like me with
extremely oblate eyes are at high risk for retinal tears and/or
detachment as a result of blows to the head).
