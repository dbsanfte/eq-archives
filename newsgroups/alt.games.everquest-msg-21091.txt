Here's the line you were looking for it was under zone/quest
changes (go figure)

Reevaluated the values of the various fish fillets. All fish
vendors should return to normal, but they won't be paying as
well for certain fishy items. This
                    resolves a problem that was created with
the increased value of player made food items all over
Norrath. Some of food items were made too valuable,
                    and merchants were complaining to their
union leaders...
