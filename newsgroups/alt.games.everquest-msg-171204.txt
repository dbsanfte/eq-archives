Well, as I recall it he said something to the effect that most people
do it, and that it is helpful in providing a way to describe your
political views concisely.  So I suppose from that you can infer that
he thinks its a good thing to do.  I didn't respond to that part of
his post, because I agreed with him that it's a common procedure, we
are social animals after all.  Like you, I haven't found any group
that's close enough to my views for me to identify with them.  But I'm
not at all certain that that makes it an inherently bad way for people
in general to behave.  My biggest bitch isn't the being left out in
the cold part, it's the use of descriptive terms like liberal and
conservative as political labels.  I think of myself as a liberal
person, but I don't see many allegedly "liberal" politicians whose
views are particularly close to mine.  And I know quite a few people
who are quite conservative (in the most positive sense of the word)
who have a similar view of so-called conservative politics.

People, they're a problem world-wide.   :-p
