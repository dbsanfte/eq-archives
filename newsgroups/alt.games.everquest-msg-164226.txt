Some universities, some of the time, have been such bastions.

I find it sad, sort of amusing, but sad, that so many people are so
eager to swallow the idea that "political correctness" is some sort
of flaw unique to the universities or to the left wing in general.
The more so as this idea is, of course, promulgated by right wingers
as part and parcel of their own equally rigid brand of "political
correctness".  If I were as doctrinaire a left winger as some of the
right wingers who post here I would now attempt to insist that this
"proves" that the right depends on "the big lie" to promote their
agenda, implying that that was a flaw unique to the right wing.  But
it's not, these "evils" are common as dirt in every social/political
organization or coalition I've ever looked at (and universities are
social organizations as surely as members-only golf clubs are).
