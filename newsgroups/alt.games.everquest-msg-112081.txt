I find I have greatest luck when I am attacking from slightly off centre to
the left of the target looking up above the horizon at between 7 to 12.5
degrees, unless it's raining where the angle changes to exactly 2.3 degrees
below the horizon. I keep a level on top of my monitor to ensure true
horizon to base my measurements off.

Also, after placing my computer desk into the middle of the room facing
SSEast within an unbroken chalk circle - everything has really picked up
dramatically. I also keep 3 black chickens and an iguana in cages at the
cardinal points in my room. The igauna is moved regularily to the current
prime cardinal point of importance as determined by closely examining the
footprints left behind by an ant in a petrie dish after walking over a 27
year old virgins menstrul fluid.

I find by diligently applying this regime I can get a total of 3.3378
percent more attacks per minute which means it is theoretical possible for
my ranger to exceed the haste cap. I say theoretically because it takes a
bit of time to set up and my six month old ranger is still level 3 and
weilding a rusty dagger....
