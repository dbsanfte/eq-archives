Just because they have the tools, doesn't mean they learn how to use them
effectively.  I've seen more clueless level 50-55 paladins in my LDoN groups
than I would care to count.  One paladin I grouped with did not use stuns,
or any spells as far as I could tell, aside from Pacify (during combat).  I
pointed out to him that not only is pacify a complete and utter waste of
time and mana when used on an engaged mob, but also that stuns are a great
way for a paladin to keep aggro! *hint hint*  He ignored my advice.  I
eventually started just rooting the mobs before tashing and slowing.  The
ranger in the group also pointed out that he was having trouble with aggro,
maybe the paladin could use some more high-aggro spells, etc. etc., but we
got no response.  That's probably the worst group I have had so far.  In
addition to the shittiest paladin on the server, the shaman (main healer)
was meleeing, while screaming "oom, hold pulls!" every other mob.  When the
ranger sent a discrete tell to her, he was told to play his own damn class.
So, ebay, or just idiocy, but with all that said, I still dig LDoN  :-)
