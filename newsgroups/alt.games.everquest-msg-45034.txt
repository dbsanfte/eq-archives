As a Halfling Rogue I dinged 13 last night in Black Burrow and acquired Dual
Wield. Yipee! What better to backstab you with... Anyway, I decided to head
north into Everfrost to check it out. No big deal. Everything I came across
/con'ed green to me. I saw a noob being chased by 3 bears, a wolf, and an
ice goblin whelp so I began chase to help out. She led us to the zone to
Halas and the creatures were immediately killed. Evidently, the guards
didn't see me at the time beacuse I passed them and approached a group of
named NPC to the left. Assuming they were vendors, I approached and right
clicked. I was immediately attacked! He conned green, but I decided to just
run to the guards as I figured he was evil and didn't want to ruin any
faction I didn't have to. When I got near the guards, one said "Filthy
Halflings...ruin our land...blabla..." And killed me. I wasn't aware
Halflings were KOS in Halas. I don't have bad faction anywhere else (besides
Qeynos Underground). Is this normal for Halas or is it just me?

Can someone tell me other areas whose racial tensions toward Halflings make
it smart for me to avoid.

Thanks for all the help.
