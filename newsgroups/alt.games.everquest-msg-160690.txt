Make it deity based.  My paladin, Precia, follows Tunare.  Since Tunare is
the elven goddess, I should be able to make Koada'dal cultural (since there
are no Fier'dal paladins, though it would be cool if Wood Elf warriors who
follow Tunare could wear Koada'dal plate).  If she followed the Marrs,
Karana, or Nife instead, she would make human cultural.
