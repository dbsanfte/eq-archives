Ohhh, the actual specialization info is new, thanks for posting it.  I'm 
not sure if bards would start as fighters, thiefs, or tradesmen.  I 
personally hope for thief, as I play my bard as a roguish trickster.  As a 
Bristlebane worshipper, and an illusion freak, I find much in common with 
the better rogues.
