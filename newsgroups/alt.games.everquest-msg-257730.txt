From what I've read - no. Only those in the encounter (before being locked)
can affect those in the party. And I think (it seems to be alluded to) that
"power" will be on a shallower pool than EQL. On the upside, they've said
that all of the mage classes will have some sort of power regen available.

Yep - unless an unengaged mob aggros him/her. Of course it won't matter
since he can't heal you.

No - when calling for help you essentially "give up" your rights to the xp.
