From what I've seen in-game and in A.G.E,. the bigger/badder/more ubah the 
guild, the less personal goals matter.  TheGuild(tm) becomes the focus and 
not the characters.  It's a natural progression.

My guild pretty much lets you do what you want, when you want, and does all 
it can to help you.  We have raids, but none are ever required ( although 
we like people to show up ).  I typically log in with nothing planned and 
check the "/ all guild" to see who is where and if anyone needs help with 
something, as does most of our members.  Pretty much all of our members put 
other peoples' goals ahead of theirs and the guild as a whole profits from 
it.

We're not Ubah, and never will be.  We started out as people who were all 
over 30 IRL who enjoy playing the game instead of letting the game play 
them.  We EXP grind, we tradeskill, we explore, we work on epics, we raid - 
but it's always our choice.  You can be in our guild and never attend a 
guild function, raid, exp group, etc. if you don't want to.  But, like 
anything else, expect to get out what you put in!  When our guild was 
formed, I was a level 17 Necro and at least 5 levels higher than the next 
highest member.  We're now able to field 20 50+ characters if needed and 
nothing has really changed about the guild except our levels and a bunch of 
new members who typically fit in very well.  Three of our finest members 
are people that left another guild because it didn't care about them as 
characters but as a means to the next guild goal.  Their loss, our gain =)

Figure out what you want from a guild and there's bound to be a guild that 
fits that description.
