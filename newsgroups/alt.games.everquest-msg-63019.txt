I doubt that Verant would do that.  For one thing what would
they do about cable modems?

I think it's likely that your ISP or phone lines are having some
problems that were coincident with your installing of the patch.

I'd find a machine that doesn't have EQ installed on it, and see if it
can connect at the full 53Kbps using the same phone line and ISP.
