	What burns me up about SOE isn't that they don't fix old bugs
but rather that they blithely introduce NEW bugs.  Which they then don't
fix because they're old bugs after that I guess.  

	My current favorite example is "You cannot see your target".
Oh, right, it's standing next to me hitting me with a club but I can't
see it because we're on a hill and on Norrath hills make you blind.

	Then there's the warping mobs bug. Or is that warping mobs BUGS?
Kite stonemight goblins over to the rocks by the spider caves.  Watch them
magically poof back to their spawn point and return with a train.  Note that
goblins can _always_ see their targets as you contemplate "Loading..."

	And how many times will they apply a patch that breaks the guild lobby
door?  I mean, really, pay someone 50 cents to click the thing and make sure
it works before you patch the production servers, really now...

	I'm aware Sony can Do No Wrong and that by daring to complain
about minor imperfections I'm showing myself to be an ungrateful casual
player.
