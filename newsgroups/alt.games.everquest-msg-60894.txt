I have never gotten anything good out of a "paying well"
call.  Not once.  Been paid 1000pp for resing someone
when I said that was my price to leave a group and come
do it... raised my rate for that to 2000pp.  Been paid
500pp for resing someone in freeport (where I happen
to be KOS) when they called out for one in EC, without
any offer made on either side.  Been given all manner
of cash and prizes, or nothing but a smile... but never
have I been less satisfied than the times when I answered
a call that read "paying well"

Paying well, it seems to me, is a euphanism for "I think
that you are going to do this for mercenary purposes,
and I intend to actually pay very poorly but want you
to think I'm going to pay a lot"

People who honestly intend to pay well simply say
how much, or don't mention payment in any way.
