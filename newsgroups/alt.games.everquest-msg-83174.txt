At least on Tarew Marr, since around when Luclin opened, either the
shardwurm broodmother or Fergul Frostsky have been !spawned and the quest
inoperable.  Although, when I did them back right before Luclin they went
off without a hitch, just announce to the zone what you're doing and ask
them to please stay away from the BM and giant fort until she's engaged with
Gralk and Fergul repops with legs and starts running to EW, and presumably
engaged by you.

Or get Coldain Skin, 3 AC, 8 Wis, 8 Int  but 35 Mana  (2.5 wt)

Or if you don't have the patience/time for that quest, even a small wisdom
diety (2 wis) might be a situational improvement for you, or the Eye of
Trust quest in Sanctus Seru

Results in a

Couple suggestions on WR bags, replace 2 backpacks with an Archaeologist
pack from Permafrost ( .4 wt  6 large slots  25% WR) and it's analogue, the
Herbalist's pack from Crystal Caverns ( 1.0 wt 6 large slots 25%  WR)

Also, the Rallic Pack is VERY nice if you have the patience/plat to get it
(note: the Grimling Runner is NOT suceptible to either snare or root, don't
even bother trying, just channel/nuke him face to face, and at least for me
he seemed to run Jboot speed, almost but not quite up to my SoW, he also
backstabs, but the most he hit me for on a BS was 70)
