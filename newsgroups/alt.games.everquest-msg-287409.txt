Ah yes click on a stone in PoK and you're at the Ashengate zone in....
err no actually wait a second.

Death is meaningless in WoW unless you're talking about multiple raid
deaths in top end raid gear which hits only your wallet.  Money is so
easily acquired I fail to see how even four or five deaths in a day
doing normal quests or xp could even be remotely considered anything
other than a minor inconvenience.

In EQ if you die and don't have a rezzer in group (or the group wipes)
then you're faced with summoning your corpse to lobby (which actually
is fairly costly now at level 80) before you can even think about
begging for or paying someone for rez.  Even then you'll start to see
measurable xp loss after a few 96% rezzes.

I don't think it's by accident that I know people who quit EQ for WoW
who are now are on their 4th or 5th level 70 WoW character yet never
even made level 70 on their years old 'main'  in EQ.  All their WoW
chars have uber (sic) levels of  tradeskills etc while 99% of them
didn't do any in EQ etc.

Reading comprehension for the win.  My old guild do Karazhan and they
all quit EQ having done nothing beyond Vex Thal, Sleepers and a chunk
of PoP pre Time.
