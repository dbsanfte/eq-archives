I think everyone is missing the point of his question:

He is asking if you have a weapon that has a built in proc and then augment
it with another proc will the weapon basically have 2 procs with equal
chances or procing? or will one over write the other.

say you have a Wind-Worn Handblade with the Shards of Sorrow proc. and you
put in a type-4 proc of Ice Wind ....will the weapon only have the Ice Wind
(made it up) proc, or both?

I would suspect that the weapon would have 2 separate procs and each would
have their own chance of procing (as we all know some procs are looser than
others with the speed at which they proc.)
