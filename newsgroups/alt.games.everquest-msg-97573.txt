    I nominate that as AGE's "Bumpersticker Quote of the Day".

    I guess the question I have is this: why? Do these changes make the
difficult parts of the game easier, or the annoying parts of the game
easier? I see changes designed to get people to go to the more difficult
areas of the game, rather than cluster in the easiest open-air zones (LoIO,
OT, DL). I see changes to hell levels that actually make levelling up more
difficult for a solo caster (more XP will need to be earned in the levels
just before spell levels, rather than just after). I've seen nothing that
significantly changes the post-50 game, where many would argue the real
challenges lie, with the exception of the caster focus items.

    Have you heard about the latest changes on Test? Nek Forest has been
changed. The spawns are more "dense", so that you don't have to go as far
from Neriak to find the level 5-9 spawns, or the 10-14 spawns, and so forth.
Nek will now support characters up to level 20, from the looks of it, and
contains more tradeskill stuff and more quest stuff (like for DE rogues, a
neglected group). Imagine how this game will be changed if the "newbie
zones" support characters up to level 20 - all the "newbie zone" dungeons
could be upgraded a la Paw or a la Cazic Thule, while still giving low-level
players a place to level up. That's a TON of new content, all of it free and
I imagine most of which will come as bug-free as possible (no artificial
deadlines to meet). If this is the future, bring it on!
