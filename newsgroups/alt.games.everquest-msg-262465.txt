Actually, if that were an acceptable format for a book, people 
wouldn't happen to have anu trouble following it. It is certainly 
no more or less difficult to follow than some of the time travel 
novels where they jump all over the place, or some of the space 
miitaria where they have 2 or 3 threads in the book and switch 
between them [cf Weber, any of the Honor Harrington novels where 
they have her viewpoint, some manticoran viewpoint, say the 
admirals, and the viewpoint of the enemy. Those can be 
purgatorial if you are not used to reading his style.]

I personally have no problem following a thread in netscape, it 
sucks the posts down sorts them, and i have enough memory to 
remember what has been happenig in a thread I am following.
