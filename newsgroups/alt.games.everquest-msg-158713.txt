You can, at any time from level 51 on, split your XP between regular and AA. 
You can split it at any ratio you choose, from 100% XP/0% AA to 0% XP/100%
AA, in increments of 10%.

But should you?  All I can say is "it depends".

One AA point is the equivalent experience of going from level 51 to level
52.  So while you can turn on XP at 51, at that level every point is quite
literally a character level that you are losing. Some people feel that Run3
is worth that tradeoff that early, and they arguably have a case, especially
if they're a puller class.

I'd go 100% XP until 60 and keep it that way until I had a buffer before I
turned on AA, then go 100% AA and get Run3.

Pre-pop, after that it didn't make any sense to do anything other than
continue with 100% AA, maybe turning XP back on from time to time to rebuild
your buffer.

But now, it depends on the AAs you get and how close you are to getting
them.  For example, in my case, I have 12 AAs spent, and 1 unspent.  I'm
halfway through my first archetype ability, and will need 5 more AAs to
finish it out and get my next title, and 9 more after that before I can get
the class ability that I really want (Dire Charm...  drool...).

So I'm looking at 14 more AAs.  That's a lot of XP, at least one level's
worth, possibly two.

Given that, I decided to go 100% XP until I hit 65.  Then I'll get a buffer,
and go 100% AA.  I'm thinking it'll be easier to get AA at 65 than it will
be at 60.  I may have fewer places to hunt, but the mobs there will give me
more AA per kill.

But if I only needed 3 more AA to get Dire Charm, I'd stick it out and get
it.  My wife deleveled from 61 to 60 because she really wants Can5, and
there are places she can solo that are blue to 60, but light blue at 61. 

So like I said, it depends.
