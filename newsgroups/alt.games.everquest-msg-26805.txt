Okay, here's the scenerio: I was in NRo this morning with my newbie
SK. I see in /ooc some guy offering 500pp and 2 +6wis rings for.....a
Velium Battle Axe. I had one of those in my hands as my only weapon at
the moment, but that was too good to pass up. I send the guy a tell
asking if he was sure that was what he wanted. He says yeah, and I
tell him I'll meet him at the platform and show him in the trade
window just to make sure.

He asks how much I want, I told him to make an offer. 800pp. I just
about fell out of my chair. TOld him sure, and he said he had to run
to the bank, wait there. I hunted around the plat for about an hour,
getting periodic tells from him saying he was hurrying. All the while,
I was in tells with a guildie about this. Guy shows up, comes through
with the money, and the deal is done. I know those things aren't worth
_that_ much... Guy appeared to be Korean by his poor english and use
of many "la"s. He was higher level, though, and kitted out in some
uber gear...

Was I wrong to have taken so much from someone who may not have known
better? He did offer....

Anyway, worst part was, as I was running off, I hit r and threw off a
tell, thinking it was to my guildie, "Think I should tell him now the
axe wasn't worth that much?". Then noticed who the last person who
sent me a tell was... the guy I bought the axe from. Never hit /q so
fast in my life.
