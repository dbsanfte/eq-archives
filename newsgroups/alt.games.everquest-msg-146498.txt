Welcome !

Start now with groups. Get to know other people, have fun, and when
you all get a few more levels, youll have quite a few friends to
adventure with.

As for which classes, that shouldn't be an issue at your level. Its
more important to get to know good people to play with. Better with a
'so-so character' by someone who's a good player, than the 'ideal
match' played by a moron.

Good luck in your travels.
