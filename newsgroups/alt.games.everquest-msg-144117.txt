Who said anything about fading out? Not I. They are not powerful so

Err...course they not realistic the point is still there, some people
enjoy almost anything but they are not as much fun to play as a druid
hence the reason more druids than clerics.

And just where will all this manna and agro control come from? hmm I
gonna nuke a mob then CH the tank hitting it? In leather armor chosen
for wis stats not ac???? No thanks )
And yes they solo well but pale in comparison to necros and mags,
played both there's no doubt. Again second or third place in the list
but that's cool. I wont point out your own exaggeration on this. )

Yes it does and its the one class that can get away with it since no
ones seen a cleric shouting LFG in the past hour. Worse in PU groups
for sure. Chanters may be more famous for this though as the healing
mindset wont attract as many arses.

No they cant keep up most particularly in that long stretch between 29
to 51 when they get not one new healing spell. And even at 51 its
pitiful compared to the damage mobs are dealing.

Ok last point compare the druids nukes to a wizzies, similar
situation. There is a difference and a significant one but the
nukes/dots do keep pace with the mobs more or less. The heals in no
way do so the class loses its defining characteristic "jack of all
trades master of none". When I play a melee my preference is cleric,
shammy, druid, bard in that order the reasons are clear enough. 

Now if they could just get mez and clarity......
