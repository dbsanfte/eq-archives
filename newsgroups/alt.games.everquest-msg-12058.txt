OK, for the first time in several weeks last night we had a big raid
with no epic-equipped clerics, and realized that we need sprinklers on
all of 'em.  Of course this means that my guild will once again be
doing the Ragefire camp, and I started thinking about all the silly
things that we do to stay entertained over the 40-100 hours that the
camp can take.  I'm sure that most other high-level players have
experienced the same thing, and I'm just curious to see what other
folks do.  Here are a few of the silly things we've done (and they get
really silly at 7am or so).

Hunt ALL of lower Sol B:  Pull everything that isn't being pulled, at
one point we were pulling all the way to lavastorm ent, with 3 pullers
at all times.  Lots of green, but it's fun to just kill kill kill.

Nekkid spawn dance:	Entire group removes all visible armor and
dances around, for extra credit fight like this

Tame a fire giant:  Have enchanter charm a fire giant, make it do
silly tricks, have entire group take screenshots in FG's lap

Silly coin tricks:  Spell out words with dropped coppers, most common
is SPAWN, followed by SPAWN DAMMIT!

Lizard spawn dance:  One of our monks, Squat Squat, has this
incredible dance he can do, basically looks like the russian dance
where the dancers squat and kick feet out in front.  Squat can do this
so fast that he looks like a dervish, all around the camp.  He's a
great monk, but even if he were clueless, would have received a guild
invite just for the entertainment value on long camps.

Helicoptor spins:  Another Squat special, get in the water (or lava)
and start spinning in circles, looks silly from above.

Races:  Set up races around the room, works especially well at
Ragefire camp because you have a very big room to run around

Drinking contests:  See who can drink a stack of booze the fastest,
even with maxxed alcohol tolerence I can usually only get about 15-17
before it says I'm as drunk as I can get.  This can stink if the guy
you're waiting for pops when you're all too drunk to fight, but ya
usually have a buffing/sobering-up period.

Duels:  The favorite way to kill time, just make sure you have enough
clerics to rez everyone in quickly.  

Language work:  switch all communication to a certain language, hope
you know it well enough to understand '3 FGs inc and boy are they mad'

Explore:  Figure out which rocks you can hide under, which tables you
can lift, which cracks can fit an ogre.

Punt the gnome:  Fun for everyone but the gnome, but they're so cranky
anyway who can tell the difference.  Of course it would be best with
that leafblower range weapon.

Limericks:  Ok, they're almost always crude, usually just plain bad,
but after 36 hours it makes sense.
