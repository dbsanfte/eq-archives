That's a popular misconception, actually. The loot table for the mobs in
the Riff house (as it's called on our server. Called the "Plate House" I
believe on some others) just contains a higher percentage of plate drops
than the other kinds. But we've had chain, leather, and silk drop off
that cycle as well. Just not as often.

As to the details, they are spread all over the place. Feeling too lazy
to type them all in here. I would start with Alakhazam's. But the short
version is that you fight your way into the throne room of the Riff
house, clear the local static spawns, go stand up at the throne and say
a key phrase and you'll trigger a series of increasingly tougher giants
that will come out and attack your forces. This culminates in a
traitorous dwarf showing up who you kill. You can then trigger it again
and do the cycle as often as you like as long as you don't let the dwarf
get away.
