That is an odd one.  But adding someone to /friends is not necessarily 
just making note of their name.  In this game, your name is pretty much 
like your phone number.  So it's kind of like asking if you can program 
someone into your cell phone.

Basically, it's just a good idea to ask before you do pretty much anything 
that involves another player, be that inspecting, /friending, offering 
trades (only had that one a couple times, someone comes up to you in the 
tunnel and plonks something in your trade window with a cheery "only 2Kp! 
you -neeed- this!"  Yeah.  Like a hole in the head I do.  Fuck off.), or 
inviting to a group...

Two stories there.  One, if you're level 3 and see a very very red con 
character sitting at the lift in kelethin, what the hell is the point of 
targetting them and typing /inv?  And two, I gotta make an exception.  
Apparently random group invites are a reasonable way to get things going 
at Seb entrance.  And it's a good way for them to find out I'm already 
grouped.  It'd be different if more people used /lfg, but they don't.
