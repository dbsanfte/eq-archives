Which ever you like better.  In the end, your starting stats will mean very
little because you can and will get items to improve them...that being said,
however Stat ALLOCATION is vital.

for the ogre, put 5 into AGILITY (you want 75 in that stat) and the rest
into STAMINA

for the barbarian, all into STAMINA (if 5 left over, put into Strength).

also note that Ogres can not be stunned from the front most of the time
(higher end named mobs will still slap you silly) and have a 10% racial
experience penalty - takes em longer to level.

Barbarians have a natural resistance to cold, can wear large or medium
armor, but hav no night vision.

I have a barb rogue and it's not THAT bad as long as you adjust the gamma
when it gets dark.

bottom line: pick the one you like the best and go with it.  THAT Is the
best race.
