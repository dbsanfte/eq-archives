I too have found grouping to be problematic and erratic at best on my
server (Unrest).  Not very many people in the nearby zones and none my
level.

The game is new but most of the people I see LFG (or not even LFG but
just around) are lvl 20 and above.  I'm currently lvl 9, so no socials
for me...

I realize 20 is not *that* high, but I remember getting groups at lvl
7 in EQ.  There's more solo'able quests in 2 of course but then what's
the point of the MM in MMORPG?

/shrug  I still primarily play EQ anyway so whatever.  Just an
observation really.
