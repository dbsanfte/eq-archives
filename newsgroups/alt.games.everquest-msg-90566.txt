A valid observation. Aside from MA, SA, and maybe a Tank Mezzer in
certain raids, additional warriors really are just baggage. But we bring
them along anyway because you want to level up as many as you can for
flexibility. Plus we all whine incessantly if you don't take us when we
dont' get one of those slots. ;-)

But yeah, the rest of your melee should be real damage dealers.
