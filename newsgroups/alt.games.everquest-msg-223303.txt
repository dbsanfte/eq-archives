No.   The mobs there are actally very easy.   It was the first place AE
killing made it's reappearance during luclin.

Generally not an experience zone.   It was added to be a raid zone.

They were to solve a problem.   Newbies were not going to dungeons, they
were all leveling up single pulling in Lake of Ill Omen.   So Verant tried
to make dungeons more newbie friendly.   They revamped the rezes so clerics
got them much earlier, added low level summon corpse and low level
evacuates, and last but not least, gave everything considered a "newbie
dungeon"... Crushbone, Blackburrow, Upper Guk, Kurn's Tower, Paudal Caverns,
etc...  an absurdly high experience modifier.
