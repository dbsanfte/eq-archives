It's in one of your options files.
I believe its somewhere in eqclient.ini so have a look through that -
I'm not at home to check right now.

In any case, deleting or renaming all your *.opt and *.ini files so that
new, default ones are created would fix the problem, but thats the
sledgehammer method - you'd lose all your preferences, hotbuttons,
socials, friends list etc. You can then replace them one by one and
restart EQ until you narrow down exactly what file the thing is stored
in.
