From the shadows, the mysterious pulpfishin@aol.com (Pulpfishin) (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

There's secret exits in that room, just try all the walls, you'll find
it.

However, you are going to need to get through quite a few mobs to get
out. At 35 they may be too much for you. If you know a druid or
wizard, it might be a lot safer for them to come rescue you.
