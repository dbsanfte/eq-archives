Yes, LDoN does require groups - as stated in the message above ...

You will find it worth while to try to go into dungeons with people you have
worked with before - when players know the roles each will take, an
adventure with a 90 minute time limit can be completed, with exceptional
party, in 30 minutes [ best group I was in did one in 24 }.

On the other hand, bad players, especially those who want to run off by
themselves where they will encounter lots of nasty things, then run back to
the party with all these nasties training, can wipe out a good party fast.

LDoN is great, but really is for group play - if you have sol'd all your
career, you will find it a different game entirely
