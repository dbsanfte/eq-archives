Its been argued in this thread at both scales. I was under the 
impression that everyone agreed it was a generally bad idea to have them 
valued as high as droppables, for precisely the reasons you've argued.

Fair enough. I haven't pickedup oow yet, so haven't really got a feel 
for what the guild tribute system costs. Up it to 'several hundred'... 
or perhaps even a few thousand.. 4k maybe? 5?

The point is at some threshold they will become 'worth looting' but not 
worth farming as a guild.

Evidently I shot too low. But you'll surely concede that there is a 
threshold where it makes sense.
