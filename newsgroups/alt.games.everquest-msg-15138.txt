At the San Diego Fan Fare the developers we "very clear"* on this.  When a
monster dies, it ALWAYS gives XP.  That XP is then plugged into a series of
calculations.  There is the Zone Bonus, the level(s) of the attacker(s), the
number of attackers in the group that gets XP, the level of the monster, and
so on.  This will devalue the experience until at some point none of it
actually makes it to you.  That is why when you solo things that recently
became green to you, you may still get XP.

There are times when people at the extremes of being able to group will get
very odd party XP.  Sometimes the highest person or people will get XP, and
sometimes all but the highest person or people will.  It depends on how the
level of the monster compares to the level(s) of the group.  They refused to
give out the calculation, but did confirm that as you get higher in levels
you can generally have a wider spread of levels in a group.  They also
pointed out that only having one very high, or one very low level for a
group is where you will notice the most odd reactions where some get XP, and
some do not.

And as always they stated you will just have to try things out at different
levels and in different zones against different monsters to really know.

So in short, XP is always given, it just may not always make it to you.
That is the Verant answer.

In my experience, A L25 can group with a L40 in some zones against some
monster and still get XP.  The 1.5 calculation some people use is
inaccurate, but a decent rule of thumb.  After 30 and again after 50 the
level gap seems to widen more.

* The term "very clear" when used by Varent seems to mean anything from 100%
solid information to something about as clear as churned up swamp water.
