After listening to you whine and moan of blowing goats all through 45, I
braced for the worst.  I have to say that the 3 days I spent in 45 went
faster then I had expected. In fact, the worst part was missing my ding to
46 last night.  I was watching the completely full blue bar and expecting
the ding for over 3 kills... Nothing.  I knew I had to ding on the next kill
and was shocked to discover myself going link-dead while fighting the mob.
Boom, you have been disconnected... I get black screen, reboot, and when i
get back the the character select screen, LEVEL 46!.  Oh well, I will still
take it. :-)
