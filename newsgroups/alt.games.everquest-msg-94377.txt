Granted. Listening to all the whiners would be bad. However, too many
times they turned a deaf ear to the players that really had legitimate suggestions
and beefs with the game. They generally had to be beat over the head with
something until they'd finally get 'it.'

"We will never add more melee bind points, its not part of 'The Vision(tm)'"
"We will never add self binders to the game, its not part of 'The Vision(tm)'"
"Hybrid exp. penalties are part of 'The Vision(tm)' and will never change."
"Wizards will never get pets, its not part of 'The Vision(tm)'"
"Alchemy is not broken and is working 'as intended'"

Group damage added to prevent kill stealing had to be 'tested' before they
thought it was a good idea. Hello?

I must admit though that EQ is a MUCH better game now than it was when
it first came out. They have fixed a lot of things that were broke and have added
many new features that really improve the game. They may be slow to change
but they do change, eventually. I just wish we didn't have to literally flood them
with requests until they get 'it.' Whatever 'it' may be.
