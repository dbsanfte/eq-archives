So adjust what you pick up. The VERY COMMON items sell for a lot.
Spider silk is 5 plat each, you can get loads of it fast and sell it
on a vendor in the bazaar in a few seconds. I made a ton selling
spider silk and bone chips, much of it bought off vendors.

Ah more on your server. On trib myself and some others are trying to
sell spider silk around 5 plat and leather padding at 5 plat. Higher
seems kind of ridiculous. 5 plat for the padding is a STANDARD price,
while the 25 plat seems inflated and can't last.

Yep, spider silk way more common than hides.
The prices are coming from supply and demand. The tradeskill guy
needs lots of spider silks but in order to sell ALL you get
consistantly, you need to charge LESS than he'd stop paying and
instead do it himself. Remember that their tradeskill items are
artificially inflated also. People won't be buying a piece of crud
item like the ceremonial solstice robe for 3 k forever, enough people
will get earrings then the bottom will fall out.

That is why spider silk is high now, its a potc item component.
Meanwhile the bear skins and acrylia will remain consistant.
