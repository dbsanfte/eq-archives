Slows do not stack, the "best" one takes effect, and either overwrites 
the others, or bounces the others that are cast.

A single shaman can cast multiple different DoTs and they will all stack, 
another shaman can cast the same DoTs as the first shaman, and they will 
also stack.  For some classes, where the DoTs do more than just damage, 
they will not stack, however, I have not found any of mine that will not 
stack.

The key is, they do have to be different DoTs from the same shaman, but, 
can be duplicated by another shaman.

So, for you, Tainted Breath will stack with Sicken, but, you cannot stack 
two Sickens of your own.  With two shaman, each can cast both Tainted 
Breath and Sicken, and all four will stack.
