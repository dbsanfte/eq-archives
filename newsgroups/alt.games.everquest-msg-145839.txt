OK, I didn't give this much study really.

Hunting in SF (isn't every non epic cleric going to be
hunting in SF for the next few weeks?  Good for
all you druids and shamans, demand for your
services just went thru the roof for exp groups,
cause there ARE no clerics to be had!) I saw
no difference in resists from the mobs, nor
did I notice myself resisting or not resisting spells
from the mobs any differently from before

Casting on myself though ( I was nuking myself
so I could test the new heals) I got an amazing
number of total resists and partial resists.  I think
one Judgement in four stuck, and only one in four
of the ones that DID stick did so for full damage.

My MR was 91, and I'm a 60 cleric casting on a 60 cleric
(naturally) so thats my resist versus an even con?
