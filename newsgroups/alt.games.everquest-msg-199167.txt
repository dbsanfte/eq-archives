Unless I am way off on my rough calculations, you are way off on how long 
it takes to regen 800 mana.  It should be closer to 2 minutes.

KEI = 14 per tick
FT1 = 1 per tick
Meditate is around 20 at your level I think, let's call it 25.

That's 40 mana per tick.
800/40=20

20*6=120 seconds

Unless I am off on meditate by 80 or so per tick, you are not regening 800 
mana in 40 seconds.

It takes me longer than that to regen that much mana, and I have FT2, MC1, 
lizard mount, cannibalize IV, and usually KEI.  I believe the Cann IV plus 
Kragg's adds 45ish per tick or so to my mana regen rate overall.  Once I 
get Cann V, I can speed that up significantly.
