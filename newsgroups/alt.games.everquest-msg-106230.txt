"Curt Schilling Points. He Clicks. He Hits RETURN. And ... Yes! Strike
Three Called!"  

The geekiest fireballer in the majors is armed with a 96-mph fastball.
And also two laptops, his own IT consultant, and digital video of his
last 20,000 pitches. 

By David Whitford, May 2002 Issue 
   
When Curt Schilling was in high school in the early 1980s, his best
friend's dad brought home an Apple computer (AAPL), one of the first.
Schilling thought it was the coolest thing he'd ever seen. By junior
year, he had his own. "So I guess I've been a computer geek my whole
life," he admits. A tall, blond geek who pitches fearsome 96-mph
fastballs for the Arizona Diamondbacks and who was named co-MVP of
last year's World Series. But a geek nonetheless. 

Schilling, now 35, still has a soft spot for Macs. He has a G3 laptop
he uses to check his e-mail -- "10 times a day," he says -- and to
manage his non-baseball affairs. But his real workhorse is another
laptop, a Dell (DELL), on which he plays "a ton" of games, including
the online fantasy/adventure megahit EverQuest. ("My main [character]
is a [level-]49 Monk named Scythehands Voxslayer," Schilling once
revealed to a website for EverQuest buffs.) So, yeah, it's partly a
toy. But not entirely. To an extent unmatched by any of his peers,
Schilling relies on technology to maintain every edge possible on the
mound. 

"Before, I was using TVs and video to look over hitters," Schilling
says as he boots up the Dell in the living room of his spring-training
condo in Tucson. "And each hitter had his own little videotape, which
was somewhat time-intensive and bulky. This system is portable. I've
got 475 hitters and 20,000 pitches on about 85 CDs right now. I can
pull up any pitch I've thrown, any count, any at-bat, any situation I
want over the last nine years." Yes, we've come a long way from the
old pen-and-paper charts that guys once kept to track which pitches
worked and didn't work against different teams' lineups. 

Up comes Schilling in freeze-frame. We're looking over his shoulder at
the catcher. It must be old footage from an interleague game, because
Schilling is wearing the red pinstripes of his former team, the
Philadelphia Phillies, and that's Yankee Derek Jeter in the batter's
box. Schilling taps the keyboard, and the video rolls. Pitch follows
pitch in rapid sequence -- no home-run trots, no tiresome throws over
to first base, no dugout shots of the manager picking his nose. And
because each pitch is a separate MPEG file, cross-referenced every
which way, Schilling can play with the data all he wants. 

"If I go to, like, Derek Jeter here," Schilling says, switching to a
data-entry screen, "I can ask for all the first-pitch strikes I've
thrown him." Up comes a list of 15 pitches. "Six of those 15 are
swinging, which tells me that early in the count, he's not a very
aggressive hitter. Now I can look at the balls he did put in play" --
back to video -- "and see where they were. Or go through and watch all
the outs and see just exactly how I got him out." Click. "Fastball
away." Click. "Another fastball away. I do this for every hitter." 

And every game. Between starts, Schilling formulates a plan to retire
each hitter he may face up to four times -- "In this count you should
do this, in that count you should do that, and if he comes up late in
the game, in a big situation, you could potentially do this." He
records his observations in a spiral-bound notebook he brings to the
dugout, and refers to this ledger between innings. 

For the data, the software, and the computer, Schilling pays about
$15,000 a year to Hertz Consulting, a political polling firm in
Petaluma, Calif., with a sideline in sports. (Richard Hertz, the
president, is a catcher in an over-30 league.) All season, Hertz
collects videotape from the Diamondbacks, digitizes the relevant data,
and ships updates to Schilling. "I'll pitch a game on Monday against
the Padres," Schilling says, "and I have to pitch against them on
Friday, and [Hertz will] have my video burned to a CD and back to me
on Wednesday." 

Hertz has a few other baseball clients, but they're all hitters, and
none is as committed to the technology as Schilling is. "It gives me
less reason to get beat," Schilling says, trying to explain why, for
him at least, there's no going back. "A lot of guys are afraid to make
the leap simply because this type of technology entails
responsibility. I don't have excuses. I'm expected to win. I know what
they pay me for, and I couldn't do the job as well as I do without
this."
