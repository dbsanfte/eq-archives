I would say that the Wu armor is a lot more important that a Fighting
Baton or similar. Monks can fight without weapons, and are actually rather
good at it, so the AC would be a lot better to start up with, especially
since youre only level 5 now. If you were around level 20 i would go for
some weapons, instead.

Dont know the race of your monk, but i ran around training HtH combat with
my Iksar monk when my 1hb and 2hb was maxed, and in Field of Bone and
Kurns its not much harder to kill a mob with hands that with a weapon, so
if you can aviod a lot of the mobs damage because of the Wu armor, that
would be better as long as you hunt in Kurns and FoB
I went to IllOmen at level 20, and there i can see a big difference in
trying to HtH the mobs compared to using 1hb and 2hb agains them, so there
i would rather use some money on one or two good 1hb weapons.

You can see a table over the monks HtH damage/delay here:
http://www.monkly-business.com/skills/h2h.asp
Cannot remember the stats on Splintering Club, but if its not much better,
consider if its worth that extra weight, you loose a lot of AC if you
exceed the weight limits.
