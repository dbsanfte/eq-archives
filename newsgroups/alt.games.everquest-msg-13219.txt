From experience I can tell you: 

12/24 Warrior Epic Primary < 10/18 Cres Blades of Lucin < 13/20
Willsapper

This is even taking into account the lower cap for piercing

Lifetap scim I haven't had a chance to test, but I would suspect it'd
fall slightly under Willsapper.

As for the willsapper proc. It's a 35% slow with a low resist rate. I
can slow the 'slowable' dragons in ToV but am yet to slow anything the
shm/enc slowers have completely failed to land on. There's no damage DoT
attatched AFAIK. Stats on the websites are wrong btw - it's now +9ac
+35hps


This is on me (L60 ogre warrior with CoF or Cowl haste (both 35%,
depending on situation) and 255 str/dex/sta on raids)
