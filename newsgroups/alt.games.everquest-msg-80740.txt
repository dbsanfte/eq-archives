I was grouped with a mage who asked that fine steel weapons looted be
given to him for his pet (his pet was already dual wielding 2 FS
swords so I assume he wanted them for future pets).  Now, I have a
level 28 mage and did not think that giving FS weapons is any better
than giving the summoned fangs to activate the dual wield ability.  By
now the pets are hitting for damage in the 20s, although I can't tell
what the damage is in the off hand.  So my question is, is it worth it
to give these dual wielding pets fine steel weapons?
