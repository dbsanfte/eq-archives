Well I also have occasional very fast zone times but I notice they are
into zones such as the nexus and bazaar which are quite small. If I
then zone into shadowhaven it takes a bit. 

Like the original poster, this is a HUGE boost to me on my tnt 16 meg
agp, 384 meg ram p2 400. I get into the game WAY faster and once in
the game I don't notice faster zoning per se, but I notice WAY less
graphics lag (and I've always had all the models enabled since I
seemed to have as much either way, as long as I have low textures.) 

I especially notice less when I open up transparent inventory and go
to move something from a pack. Previous to texture cache my mouse
would bog insanely to the point where I'd do change view to get to the
old inventory instead. With texture caching I don't know what the
diffrence is but usually if my mouse does bog with transparent
inventory it stops right away. I also notice less "stops" in game
where I'm catching up and less lag when I approach or pass players.
