The size of the drum has to do with the movement speed of the lizard.  To 
the best of my knowledge, the color thing is completely bogus, they offer 
different colors for the same reason they do that with horses, different 
people like different colors.  If you price the drums, you will see that, 
like horses, they go up in price a lot depending on the size of the drum.
