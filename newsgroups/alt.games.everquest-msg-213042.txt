They test the most common setups out there?  What could possibly make you
think that?

Luclin and the "umbra" system showed that they don't have a single AMD cpu
among their test boxes.

Hell, for six months they either didn't own a Creative Labs soundcard or
were so utterly unable to comprehend how to program for it if they did.

I'd say their test boxes are whatever they've got sitting around.  Probably
the same machines that GMs and devs use to be in-game.  I'm inclined to
believe that any software development firm is going to have a high
saturation of top-end computers.

I'd also place bets that they don't have a P2-800 with a Voodoo 3 or any of
a number of what have been *very* popular configurations among gamers.
