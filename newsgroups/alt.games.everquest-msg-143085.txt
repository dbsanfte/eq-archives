I can't see ever 2 boxing a bard, but if you've ever played a mage
you'll see a profound difference.  Especially now that I have a 
BWS (13.5 sec r-click nuke) there isn't much to do in most routine pulls
but Stand/Assist/Pet kill/chain nuke from staff - Refresh BOIV and
DS as appropriate.

I 2 box my cleric and mage when "soloing" but my buddy has a 2nd 
machine and account now, and when grouped wtih him (he's our
regular group's MA) he runs the cleric.  

3 of us always group together (58 dru, 58 ranger and 55 mage)
and now the ranger has a 40 cleric to play with.  I'm trying
to think of a class to supplement that group, and one that can
help while ungrouped when our 55 ranger/wiz husband and wife 
friends show up.
