so my 50th level enchanter had charmed a kromriff guardsman in
eastern wastes, and we were fighting some giants in the "prison
camp" area when i got disconnected.

when i can finally log back in, i'm dead.  (on the character select
screen, he was naked, but still holding both steins...?)  so i go
back to EW and head back to where i died, but my corpse is nowhere
to be found.  i finally secure the services of a friendly bard and
she informs me that my corpse is quite a ways to the north of the
prison camp -- out in the ocean, in fact!  she retrieves it and i
thank her profusely.

i don't see how my corpse got there.  what happened?  even if i
went into NPC mode and started running away, i would've gotten
smeared long before i made it to the ocean, i'm sure.

any ideas?
