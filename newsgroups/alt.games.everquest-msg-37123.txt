You can turn off inspection messages now, if this annoys you. Just
ignore the idiots that try to sell you banded armor for 60pp a piece.
You're going to run into them regardless of whether they are inspecting
you or not. Just remember, you're paying $10 a month to have fun;
there's no rule that says you have to let your fun be ruined by stupid
people asking/offering you stupid things. If they persist, put them on
ignore and move on. If they start doing other things,
training/KSing/foul language or emotes, get a nice bunch of it onscreen
and /report it and /petition them.
