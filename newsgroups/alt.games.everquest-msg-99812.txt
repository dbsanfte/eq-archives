Actually, it's a good analogy, buy you have to be willing to look at the
point, and not just dismiss it because you happen to disagree with it.

Maybe not, but I still think you would be an idiot for driving up to a
Burger King and asking for a taco.  You can have the strike back, it looks
better on you.

Strike?  You didn't even pitch.  If you're going to try to claim victory
over one of my points, at least use a point I made.

If I asked for a port from a druid to GFay, I would expect to end up in
Butcherblock.  I knew this back at level ten.  Of course, it's my habit to
learn about things before I use them (ie, the way ports work, in this case).
It seems reasonable to ask that others do the same.

And you're fired as umpire.

More like, you go to McDonalds and ask for a Whopper, and they give you a
Quarter Pounder with cheese.  Annoying, yes, but it's your fault for not
knowing what you're getting into.  It's the reason I always ask if the
restraunt serves coke.  I've had enough waitresses not ask "Is Pepsi OK?"
(no, it certainly is -not-, btw).  I've taken the responsibilty to make sure
I'm getting what I want.

The customer's, for not looking at the menu.  EQ is too unforgiving to not
know what you're doing.

Hardly.

Again, Hardly.  After a month in game (including a restart, as I moved from
Prexus to The Raithe), I had a good idea as to how things worked, on the
large scale.  Am I the only one in the game with the least bit of curiosity?

In other words, they're using their resources and being aware of things
before they jump in.

The major ones (ie, BB, NK, WC) are.  Before I went to Velious, I didn't
know where they were on that continent.  Before I accept a port there,
though, I'll make sure I know where the heck I'm going.

No, but paying attention to the game will give a good guess by that level.

By level 16?  Yes, I would expect that to be basic knowledge.  Of course, my
Paladin (wearing Ro, no less) still gets asked for SoW.

That is a point, but hardly the one that was being made, and not the one I
was arguing against.

If, by level 16, they don't know enough to tell the difference between a
Wizard, and a Druid, then yes.  They should be beyond that on the learning
curve.

> about the game as other people"?  Don't be a jerk.

Given your attitude in this post, you have no place calling anyone a jerk.
