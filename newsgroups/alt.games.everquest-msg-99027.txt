I ran my bard last night and didn't have any problems.
So I guess you'll need to be more specific.  I buzzed across 10-15 zones
running a quest, taking on the occasional mob for a little xp.

I do remember a patch back last year where bards were seriously
broken for about a week.  It was so pathetic that I couldn't even sing
Selo's Accelerondo successfully... pity the bard begging for SoW!


You can probably understand Verant's position on Bards... they want to
please the most people possible with any change made.  If they focus on
a class played by 2% of the players, they are not getting much bang for
the buck.  Expect bards to be broken often and for long periods.  When
they do work well, you'll be happy.  I've been living with long song
recovery times since a couple of patches ago... it has made song twisting
more tricky, but still doable with the right hot keys, e.g.:

/stopsong
/stopsong
/cast 3

(the second stopsong is a delay to give enough time for recovery)
