Sure, I pointed out the same thing earlier in the thread.  But I don't 
think you -just- make the rich richer by doing this, I also think you 
prevent the poor from getting outlandishly good items due to them being 
dirt cheap simply because they are common.

This is what I always thought Mudflation meant; new items that are 
available at a certain level which blow away what used to be "good".

My concern isn't the sharpened flotsams of the world, though, its things 
that are dirt common for the level 60s which end up in the hands of the 
level 10s.

I think this is an interesting and possibly crippling point.  First, 
though, let me say that I am not -intent- on punishing anyone, nor in 
fact am I intent on the No Drop server concept at all.  It came up in a 
couple other threads, and I thought the idea was worth exploring in its 
own thread.

Whats interesting about your point is that a poorly geared member of 
certain classes isn't much worse than a well geared one, but in other 
classes there's a very large difference in what they can do based on the 
quality of their gear.

Would warriors, paladins, and SKs really suffer all that much if their 
gear was worse?  You wouldn't see berserkers or beastlords or bards or 
rangers taking over the tanking, because they can also only do that with 
really good gear.   I assume you didn't mean rogues or monks because you 
lumped them in there already.

Rogues... they need what, one piece of gear in order to shine?  Are 
there that few mobs dropping decent piercers as you level up?

Monks... well, what can I say.  Maybe unnerf them on this server only; 
the nerf was really aimed at the monks who were wearing tons of all/all 
gear which gave them outlandishly good AC  (compared to items which are 
monk wearable); maybe on a server where you can't get crazy good stuff 
just by browsing the bazaar this wouldn't be a problem.

I'm not voting one way or another, I'm just asking; what do you think 
would really happen if those classes were all nerfed the same way; would 
people abandon the tank/healer/CC/DPS plan completely?
