*Shrug* Mock me if you will, however that doesnt alter the fact that the
majority ( VAST majority ) of the druids that I have encountered have
specialized either Evoke or Conjure, and being in an all Elf guild, Ive met

Z - Spec'd Evoke, and Loves it even though Spec'd Conjure is more to my solo
hunting style.
