Somewhere in the analogies, the point got lost.

This isn't about someone playing the game, amassing platinum, and purchasing 
items in the bazaar in lieu of actually looting the items themselves.  The 
conversation specifically is about someone paying real life money out of the 
game so they don't have to do either thing.

In one instance, you're playing the game.  In the other, you're not.  That's 
the difference, and that distinction seems to have slipped out of this 
conversation.
