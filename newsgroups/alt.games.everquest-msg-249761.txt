   Yes, in fact, I think I already did.  I've always had to fight the urge
to add too much information in my sig, usually about what characters I'm
playing, where, and what they are up to.  I have to remind myself sometimes
that while this might be fascinating to me, it might not be to everyone
else who reads age.
