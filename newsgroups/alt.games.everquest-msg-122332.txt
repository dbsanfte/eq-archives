LOL!  Time for this one again already?

No, my friend, there was actually a "fun loving" roleplaying
Rogue running around having some fun with people.

There is NO WAY to pickpocket another player on a normal server.

He/she just had some clever macros/emotes set up like:

/e Picks %T 's pocket for 3 gold
%T 's Pocket has been picked for "x" gold by "insert name"

Confused the hell out of me the first time I encountered it inside Black
Burrow.
