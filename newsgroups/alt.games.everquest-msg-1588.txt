From what you wrote you have trained them, and there is no question
about it. :(

I've seen it many times, but then my experience is year+ and 56 levels
of main character.

If things were as you thought they were it would be much more difficult
to train someone then it in fact is.

This just doesn't wash, sorry. You can in Oasis you can bring mob from
_any_ direction you like (unless you camp right by the zone, then
obviously can't bring it from behind the zone line).

># 3 - I would have helped them if they had /yelled. They did not.

Why? Correct and in fact decent behaviour from you would be to go back
and aggro your mob some more to pull it off them. It was your pull, you
are responsible for training them.

As for you dying - you had sow (I am assuming your partner was at least
lvl9) and you could outrun the mob that killed you.

I dislike this about Oasis. For some reason those that play there
believe it is everyone else's duty to buff/heal and save them. Mark my
words - once you are higher in level you will avoid that zone at every
opportunity.
