Yeah I was shocked myself, as I first heard about it while reading up on
quests involved in S Ro.  I was 2 boxing and had my druid parked at the
wizzy spires, PLing my wizzy who pulls from both Derv camps.  Once and
awhile with the druid I check tracking to look for the AC and there she was,
Terrorantula.  Was light blue to 51 and I had done about 60% damage and I
saw someone else trying to kill her, but since I was LOM to begin with, I
let them finish and I got the exp =)  Huge spider though!
