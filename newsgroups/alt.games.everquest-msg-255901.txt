If they know their stuff it can be done with 2 offtanks, but I
wouldn't do that unless I was confident to begin with. And two
enchanters to be safe.

Also the offtanks (and probably the enchanters) will need healing. Not
much, but an actual healer there.

I don't remember anything obvious; people just know by their names
now.

No.

They are easy to kill, the offtanks can even kill them without meaning
to if they get bored (emp is a long fight), but they respawn seconds
later full health and with no aggro built up, just ready and rearin to
jump into the clerics. So you have to keep them alive.

Take four groups, more if you can. And remember Emp is immune to
regular weapons, he requires shissar bane weapons to hurt through
melee (other than procs).
