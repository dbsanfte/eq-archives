A decent sore of the storyline itself is my guild's page:
http://1fol.cjb.net
Follow "message board" and the "We are at War" thread.  About 300 posts
(mostly contributors) and almost 20,000 hits (half in the last week!).
We've been having folks come from all the servers just to see what's been
uncovered.
