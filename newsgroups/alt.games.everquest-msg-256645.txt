Looks like I did the same thing, assist puller and then announce his mob 
as target.

For anyone but the MT the rule is always the same; only hit the target 
the MT calls, only hit it once assist is called if there's an assist 
call (I wasn't using one), only the MT ever breaks mez (I was basically 
using the mez broke message as my "start hitting it" message)
