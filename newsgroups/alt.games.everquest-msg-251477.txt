	I suggest that that is opinion rather than fact.  If the point is
to allow role playing why should I not be able to role play a hermit?
Why can't I be Aragorn wandering the wilds alone as well as Aragorn 
the leader of the 9 or Aragorn the king?

	And I think that you sell Everquest short whne you insist that its
ONLY strength is  massive group interactions.  In fact, you've set up s
self fulfilling prophecy, by vigourously resisting any change that might
increase its strength in other areas.
