If I truly believe that God is omnipotent and omniscient, then I also 
must believe that I do not have free will.

If I believe I have free will, then God cannot be both omniscient and 
omnipotent.

I happen to believe the latter.  I could be wrong in my beliefs, in which 
case, although I think I have free will, in reality, I do not.  This does 
not mean that I am right.

A colorblind person may not see a green light, but, the light is still 
green, the fact that he percieves it differently does not change that 
fact.  If the color blind person says that the light is not green, he is 
wrong, if he says that he does not percieve a green light, he is correct.
