You will not evade me, runen@netcom.no (Rune Ness):

I only play at night when the rate is lowest (can't get DSL till I
move) and pay off my ISP with 40-50 bucks a month (which reminds me, I
have to pay them tonight and I've misplaced the invoice... ah there it
is, 317 NOK for 3 weeks of february). How much do you pay, Rune?

3 dollars is a one way bus ticket in to town from where I live.

Oh, and I dealt with GMs last night. Wanted to change my alt's last
name. It went without a hitch (except for when stupid group got me
killed while I was talking with guide) and I didn't even have to wait
very long.
