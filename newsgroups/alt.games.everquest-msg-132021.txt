the muppets aren't going to be teaching about sex.  AIDS and HIV are HUGE
problems in Africa, and it's admirable that PBS is trying to help, for the
good of the planet.  as a parent you should value this education whereever
it comes from, maybe people being educated about such things will prevent
your daughter from being raped, because the people honestly belive that sex
with a virgin cures AIDS.
