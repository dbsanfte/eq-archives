Yeah, that would be nicer, but that might be too much work, or too risky, or
both.  The "too much work" part comes from having to write new text for the
journal for every step of every existing quest.  The "too risky" part comes
from the likelyhood that this would also require modifying the quest
data structures to include that information, which could lead to major
breakage that could take many patches to fix.

Full quest journals might be the kind of thing that needs to be designed in
from the start.
