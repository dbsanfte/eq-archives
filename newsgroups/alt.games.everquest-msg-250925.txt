Yes, when I created my enchanter about four and a half years ago, I put
starting points into INT and CHA.  Different game then, really.  Gear wasn't
as readily available back then and the story one poster in this thread told
about a 20's enchanter with well over 1,000 HP was unheard of.  Of course,
back then, we were all pretty much "mains" so "twinking" with 10,000 pp
wasn't as possible.

If you're going to "twink", then option "b" seems to be the way to go.  The
current school of thought that many enchanters nowadays subscribe to is that
HP are of prime importance.  According to this line of thought, you would
put everything you can into STA at startup, then buy good HP gear for him.
The arguement you hear for this is, "No one ever died because they ran out
of INT or mana.  Everyone in Norrath has died because they ran out of HP."

Having said that, I don't think you can really handicap your character with
starting stats.  A lot of people make choices based on what kind of
personality they want their character to have.  Role-play reasons.  I've
made a lot of choices in race-class combinations not because it was the best
way to mathematically "maximize" my characters.  I just wanted something
unique.  I chose a Gnome as my enchanter partly because "on paper" it seemed
one of the weakest races (the huge CHA penalty).  Now they are quite common
not because CHA isn't important, but because you can easily make up for it
in gear.  (Of course, my Erudite paladin still struggles some, but he's
saving up some cash, slowly.)  It all depends on how you want to play the
game.

P.S.  Thank you for using the full name "enchanter:  a magician or sorcerer"
rather than "chanter:  a singer."  The latter seems to be used more and more
commonly, even though it grates on the ears of many enchanters as well as
bards.  :)

Good luck and keep us posted on your new character.
