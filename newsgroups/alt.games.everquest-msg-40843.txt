I don't know what to say. I don't know what to think. I want to look
away, but I can't. I don't want to hear anymore, but I have to listen.
Something needs to be done. The question is what? First response from
everyone is strike back just as violently. It will escalate. There is
no good outcome that I can forsee.

I want to go back to bed, but it won't do any good.

"Worrying about civilians wastes soldiers' lives"? 100 soldiers lost
to avoid the needless loss of 1000 civilians isn't worth it?

There's no right answer. They're all wrong.

Do not walk behind me, for I may not lead. Do not walk ahead of me, for I 
may not follow. Do not walk beside me, either. Leave me the hell alone.
