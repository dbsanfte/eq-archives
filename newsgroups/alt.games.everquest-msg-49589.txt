Well, the game is virtually lag free for me.  I'm on a cable modem so my
ping time is very low, but this gives me the ability to see where other
bottle necks might be.  I can tell you there is no bottle neck on their end.
If you can play other MMOGs with your connection I can't imagine that you'd
have problems with DAoC.  As far as the other system requirements.  Well,
the box lists a 450 mhz as a minimum, so you can probably safely assume you
need a 600.  Also, I think you need a 32 mb video card.  The textures in the
game are quite detailed.  I don't think, however, that the system
requirements for a decent DAoC experience are going to be as high as those
for Luclin.  So if you are an EQ addict, its probably getting close to time
for an upgrade anyway.

Well, an online reviewer I read said it best when he said that DAoC isn't a
revelutionary game but an evelutionary game.  DAoC essentially IS Everquest.
It is everquest in the same sense that Unreal Tournament IS Quake III Arena,
or in the same sense that Command and Conquer IS warcraft III.  They are
similar games in the same genre with similar control schemes, and neither of
them have any remarkable or outstanding bugs or severe flaws which put one
game ahead of the other, so all of that considered it just comes down to the
differences in play mechanics.  DAoC made some changes to the standard set
with EverQuest that that *I* feel are improvements but many may not.

I will detail those changes soon (as I get more familiar with the game) on a
post here in this newsgroup.

My advice is I wouldn't let this semi-historical fantasy background be too
much of a factor in my decision if I were you.  Because It doesn't seem to
play a very big role at all.  It is used, it seems, mostly to influence the
architecture and as a backdrop.  There isn't much of a King Author story
going on.
