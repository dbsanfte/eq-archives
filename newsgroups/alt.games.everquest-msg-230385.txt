Depends on your point of view. Twinking is often considered getting 
something you didn't earn... another variant of twinking adds getting 
something you could not acquire except on the backs of characters much 
higher level than you.

This 2nd clause is much more restrictive, because it recognizes the 
player economy as a distorted content distributor. The player economy 
facilitates the transfer of high level content to low level players.

Imagine a world where you can work your ass off and extract a pittance 
from the world, or you can offer menial services to the superrich in 
exchange for their left overs and garbage... but in this case their left 
overs and garbage is greater than you could ever obtain yourself.

This is the day-to-day of the EQ player economy. A 40th level can quest 
and hunt and camp and obtain relatively junky items... or he can perform 
menial tasks like selling bonechips to high levels and then turn around 
and buy their garbage, which will be items far beyond his own ability to 
acquire.

Is that twinking?

If you ran into a 40th in full cultural armour, and asked him how he got 
it and he told you he quested, and hunted the drops, worked up his 
tailoring and bought the gems... and made it himself: you would say he 
earned it. No questions asked.

If he told you he spent a couple days in Kurns towers farming 10th level 
skeletons for bonechips, which he then sold, and used the proceeds to 
buy a 50th level's hand-me-downs would you be as impressed?

Sure he earned them, even paid fair market value for them, but even so, 
it was a trivial and easy road he took...comparatively, they were handed 
to him on a silver platter for virtually no work... and that sounds a 
lot like twinking to me.

Not that twinking is inherently bad, but as you said, if you want avoid 
being twinked because you want to experience the content throughout the 
game then you are robbing yourself of that experience by buying high 
level items in the bazaar. Its not much fun to explore content that 
never drops anything better than what you've bought.
