Does that not overclock the card as well?

I know for certain that bumping up the FSB (CPU bus) speed
will overclock the CPU, since the CPU clock is set as a fixed
multiplier of the FSB speed.  Is that not the case for video 
cards also?

Even if it isn't, increasing the video card bus speed
(if it can take it without glitching) will help games
like EQ pump more texture/3D-mesh data into the card faster,
which is bound to help.
