That's nothing. I paid $1400 a month for a tiny piece of shit (and
right when I moved out, they RAISED the rent on the new people). Here
in IN, a GIGANTIC HOUSE costs $800 dollars to rent. An actual HOUSE,
with humungous lawns and everyting, I am so not ever moving back to
California ever again, until they can get the cost of living to a
reasonable level (not going to happen till it sinks in the ocean --
then you can get a drainage grant and rent will be dirt cheap... er...
water cheap). 

Though, California did take a step closer to getting me to even warm
up to the idea of moving back by evicting Gray "White Devil" Davis.
