Assuming that you access each account on a seperate computer, I'd guess 
that one of them has the resolution set to 640x480. That one is the one 
which returns to the windowed mode when you open the character's inventory 
screen. Change the resolution to something higher and it should stay in 
full screen mode when you open the inventory.
