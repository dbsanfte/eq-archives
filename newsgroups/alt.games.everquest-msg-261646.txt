I was engaging and killing mobs wearing banded armor I made myself, 
wielding a weapon I quested myself, and a few pieces of armor I looted 
and/or quested well into my 40s.  I was soloing yellow and red mobs with 
that equipment.

The thing is, you can fight level appropriate mobs with gear that is 
dropped by level appropriate mobs, you just won't xp anywhere near as 
fast as if you use level inappropriate gear.  We have been spoiled by 
mudflation.

At level 65, wearing level appropriate gear from mobs that I have 
personally participated in killing, and/or items I have quested, I can 
still solo yellow and red mobs, as well as group to kill mobs that drop 
upgrades for me.
