Conjuration should be as close to maxxed as possible, and divination is
verrrry helpful when you want to use Superior Camo. Also, I would work on
those blunt skills if I was you as there are some nice blunt weapons. I
know that druids don't melee much after 20 or so, but it IS nice to be
able to hit if you want to!!
