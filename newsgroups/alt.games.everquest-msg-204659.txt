Pretty good actually. The game kibd of grew on me after a couple of days.
I;ve read a ton of stuff from various websites and here. It's all been
tremendously helpful. It can be pretty frustrating sometimes (those damn
basilisk hatchlings). Some things seem impossible. I've had a real tough
time grouping because I can't type very fast and never can figure out what
people have in mind. The Bard armor quest is fun, but I'm probably going to
have to kill a million orcs to get a fibila. But the real slap was finally
dying at level 10. I guess the first time you are never really prepared for
it. Fortunately, my corpse was in a pretty recognizable place (on a bridge)
in Crushbone. Still, I was really nervous that something would attack me
when I was completely unarmed. I guess I need to keep some spare weopons in
the bank. But after reading about SWG, I think I may buy that and try to
play it from the start. There is something appealing about breaking new
ground. It will be tough to break away from this, thoughIt seems like a lot
of fun,
