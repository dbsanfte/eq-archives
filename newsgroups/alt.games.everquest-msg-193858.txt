There are  a multitude of variables here that you didn't list.
STR.
Atack rating with each weapon
Dual Wield rating.
LVL
Haste
Look at how damage is figured.  Taking the magic number, the value you will
hit for more than any other.
magic # = (2*damage)+ damage bonus

Rememer that you don't get a damage bonus on the offhand weapon,  and that
you don't hit with the second weapon everytime you hit with the first one.

The best way to figure it out is to get a log parser like YALP and go find a
green/light blue mob with a fast respawn time.  Kill it about 15 - 20 times
with both configureations. Keep everything else the same.  Same STR, same
Haste, no atk buffs, no dex buffs.  When you get done compaie your Damage
per second with the two setups.  Higher DPS = quicker fights.

One thing toi remember though is that you will take more agro with the fast
dual weilding thatn you will with the slower more powerful 2hb.
