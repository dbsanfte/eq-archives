No, he didn't say "xxx has spawned, get here NOW."  He said "RAGEFIRE has
spawned, get here now!"

You can't schedule some events, typically epic encounters.  Off the top of
my head here are three:
Enchanter: Verina Tomb in Neriak
Druid: VS Remains in Karnors
Cleric: RAGEFIRE in (probably) Skyfire

In all three of these things, if you can't mobilize and be ready within an
hour you've lost your chance at that spawn for a week or two, more than
likely.  If your guild has no interest in getting their epics, that's
cool...good thing, since at least no druid, enchanter or cleric would get
theirs unless you HAPPEN to have 2-3 groups sitting on the spawn spot for
some other reason (which totally leaves the enchanter out).
