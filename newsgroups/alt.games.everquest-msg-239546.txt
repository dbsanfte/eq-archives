Also worth noting that the j-boots can be good to hang on to. (For the 
original poster) I'm assuming you're not up into the high end game yet. 
But if you wind up joining an upper tier raiding guild, it's almost 
always a requirement for members to have a couple of insta-click buff 
items for use on raids against mobs that dispell lots of your buffs. 
J-boots are a cheap and easy one to have on hand for that. With all the 
bank room we get these days, it shouldn't be that hard for you to 
squirrel them away for a rainy day.
