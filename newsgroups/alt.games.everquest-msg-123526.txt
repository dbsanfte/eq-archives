Least "Gear Dependant" = Most "Gear Independant"

Being able to summon all of your basic needs, as well as focus items
that enhance your casting ability is a huge advantage.

The mage does not have to use any of the items they can summon, but
the items give them a FREE (time/mana costs only) and very powerful
edge. 

The focus items make them more powerful. The bags allow them to hold
loot (and reduce weight 100%), so they can fund/equip/re-equip
themselves much easier. Bandages and weapons can be used and/or
sold/traded to other players.

They cost nothing but the time it takes the mage to summon them and
med back the mana. They enhance the mage (especially the focus items)
making them more efficient.

Both classes rank at the top. I guess we will have to agree to
disagree :-)
