A quick check at www.gamestop.com (which covers Gamestop, FuncoLand,
Babbages, and Software Etc, and maybe more) finds it is in stock at 20
of the 22 stores within 100 miles of my zip code (98383...Seattle
area).

Checking some other random zip codes...31 of the 45 stores within 100
miles of Pasadena, CA, have it.

35 of the 59 stores within 100 miles of Chicago, IL, have it.

9 of the 10 stores within 100 miles of Miama, FL, have it.

9 of the 17 stores within 100 miles of Austin, TX, have it.

Doesn't look sold out "everywhere" to me.  Perhaps you need to be more
specific?
