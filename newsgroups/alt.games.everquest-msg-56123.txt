2 points here. not everyone does better with a map. I do better with
landmarks, and most maps of EQ zones do not help me at all, all they do
is get me even more lost.

I've never used coins or dropped items though..I just learned how to use
/loc and sense heading to get where I need to go
of course, this only helps in large open areas, not mazes and
tunnels...in these zones, I follow people enough, I learn the way....but
then, I have a decent internet connection, and follow orders well

the second point? not everyone has a printer...I know it's hard to
believe, but it's true...
