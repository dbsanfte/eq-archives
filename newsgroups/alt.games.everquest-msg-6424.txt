I love mages.  I will always accept one into my group.  They are, plain and
simply, the best thing you can have in your group for dealing damage, next
to perhaps a very well twinked rogue.
My mage is level 36, and around the high 20's I hunted at the giant fort in
Frontier Mountains.  We figured out that the giants there had from 1200-1500
hit points.  Every fight, between my and my pet, I dealt out at least 600hp
of that total.  This is in a full group as well.  So, by myself I was doing
up to half of the giants hp.  And this wasn't by going all out.  This was by
using enough mana that I could meditate it all back before the next pull was
to our group.

Mages also have the best damage shields in the game, so if I gave the main
tank a dmg shield, I was doing another 200 or so hp just from that.
Amazing how much dmg mages are capable of as long as they're not being
pounded on.  The most important thing to learn is aggro control...so that
when doing all that  damage, the mob doesn't come after you.  It's all about
timing.  So many people I have grouped with, do not know squat about
controlling their aggro...
/rant
Wizards that overnuke, have the mob pounding on them, and when it's finally
taunted away, NUKE AGAIN!!  I mean come on...how dumb do you have to be.
So, of course, the mob is back on the Wizard, and they die...
/rant off

Anyway, mages are very useful.  I have made money summoning waterstones for
people going to Kedge Keep.  Bags of bandages for monks/warriors.
Coldstones for nightblind humans, barbarians, and erudites.  I find the
weapons are mostly useless (unless we're fighting summoned mobs) but like
was said earlier, they're great for pets, so you can sell all those fine
steel weapons you loot...What's that?  They're too heavy for you?  Oh,
here's a 6 slot weightless bag to put them in, that will hold any size item.
Mages rock!
