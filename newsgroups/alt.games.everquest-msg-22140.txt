I didn't say it made a huge difference, but it does effect how hard
you hit.  

From Brad's explination of what the different stat's effect:

"STR: determines how much you can carry; influences maximum and
average damage; influences how quickly you learn many offensive
skills"

Whether it's worth it, I dunno.

Once again, from Brad's explination of stats:

"DEX: how quickly you learn weapon skills; how often weapon will proc;
how quickly you learn rogue skills; how hard you hit with bows "

I was wrong about double attack and dual weild, but I did qualify my
comments as unsure at best.  Dex DOES effect crits.  My troll warrior
with 106Dex was grouped with an Ogre warrior with only 77Dex and I was
getting at least half again as many crits as he was.
