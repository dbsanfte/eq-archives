Not just because the 'gaming enviroments' are different. The analogy in and
of itself is faulty for the reason I mentioned above.

I wasn't arguing for one or the other. Just commenting on the analogy :)

You don't need to exaggerate to make your point :)


What about this analogy:

Soccer players. Each team is given a regulation uniform they are expected to
wear. One player decides to wear the uniform but with a headress he stole
from the The Village People (The 'Indian'). The game is the same. Same
amount of players. Same rules. Same goal. But other players find it
distracting, disrespectful, annoying, stupid, etc.
