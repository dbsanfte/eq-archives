Can I Play With Madness
Find this song on Sheet music, CD
(Smith/Dickinson/Harris)
Give me the sense to wonder
To wonder if I'm free
Give me a sense of wonder
To know I can be me
Give me the strenght to hold my head up
Spit back in their face
Don't need no key to unlock this door
Gonna break down the walls
Break out of this bad place

Chorus:
Can I play with madness - the prophet started at his crystal ball
Can I play with madness - there's no vision there at all
Can I play with madness - the prophet looked and he laught at me
Can I play with madness - he said you're blind too blind to see

I screamed aloud to the old man
I said don't lie don't say you don't know
I say you'll pay for your mischief
In this world or the next
Oh and then he fixed me with a freesing glance
And the hell fires raged in his eyes
He said do you want to knowthe truth son
- I'll tell you the truth
Your soul's gonna burn in the lake of fire

Chorus 2 times
