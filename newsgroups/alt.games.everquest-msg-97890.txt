It's even better than that if you just count the XP required to get to
level 11 vs. level 60.  The number works out to about 0.15%.  Saying
"the first 1/6 of the levels" is so disingenuous.

Indeed.

I truly don't know what you're worried about, Jazz.  Levels 1 - 10 are
so trivial it's not funny.  This is a minor improvement for low level
characters at most, not something earth-shattering.  The only thing I'm
mildly bothered about is respawning with all your gear until level 11
(I think level 6 would be better), but even that, once again, is a
minor change.
