True Nerf does not really need to have a timeframe in mind by definition
Nerf refers to loss , the taking away of something useful and fun to those
that want it.

Time frame certainly impacts the perception of loss. If you rode a bike for
40 years then rode a car one day and never again the loss is slight. However
ride a car for 40 years and then not again the loss would be horrid.

Perhaps the single target cast  and the group and the mgb casts were meant
to be different. Probably Not.
It Probably was meant for specific levels.
If it was fixed right away fine.
By not fixing right away it appears intended and one of the best features of
the game.

By Nerfing it now. Well it's a loss. A true NERF.
Having KEI in game hasn't hurt gameplay one bit.
Only the ones the don't want others to have it will be happy.....commonly
known as a nerf.
