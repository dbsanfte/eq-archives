And for "family" type guilds than can muster flag groups...the split within
the guild between those who are flagged and those who are not causes
problems.

Also, there is the limited number of XP areas for 61+ characters.

Combine that with the flagging, and PoP was very devisive for a lot of
guilds.

planes.
