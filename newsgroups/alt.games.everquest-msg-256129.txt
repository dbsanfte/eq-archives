Druids get the Charm Animal line of spells starting at fairly low levels. 
However, these are highly unreliable and you will find yourself being chewed on
by whatever you charmed as soon as it breaks.  LOL

At level 50ish you get to summon a cute little bear who has approx 500 hp and
couldn't hit the side of a barn if it fell on him.

The main 'pet' Druids get is once you start doing AA points and you get Dire
Charm.  Dire Charm is unbreakable and really comes in quite handy at times.  

Druids don't really need pets however...  your main killing power is going to
be in your DoT spells...  Well that isn't entirely accurate either as after
level 34, you will also be able to 'Quad Kite' mobs.  Again though, no pet
needed.

Good luck with your little tree hugger  :)
