Be glad the "safe spot" wasn't the prison box.  Basically in all zones,
the "safe spot" is 0,0,0.  In some dungeons, that is a closed white
walled box No entrance, no exit.  If you zone while dead or
unconscious,  you will zone to the safe spot.

OK, I have tremendous admiration for someone who goes to the trouble of
learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
