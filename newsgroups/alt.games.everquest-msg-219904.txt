Has anyone been in one?  My friend the paladin is setting one up for Sunday for
"low levels".  My 42 cleric will be attending.  I've never done a raid though
much less a LDoN raid.
Any advise or websites anyone can point me to?
And isn't there a site somewhere with raid computer hints?  how to join the
right channels, how to set your options for minimum lag, that kind of thing?
Thanks :)
