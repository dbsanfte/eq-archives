Are you just the dumbest moron here?  Or did you recently have brain
surgery?  'Cause if you can't figure what he's driving at, you MUST repeat
grades 1 - 12.  (either that or you're an Arab.)

Geez tyger!  Are you so mindless you couldn't realize that totoro was
complaining about the "skip poll" option DOESN'T FUCKING WORK?  Skip Poll
means just that, SKIP THE POLL.  It means he doesn't WANT to answer the
question, no matter if his reasons are valid or born from paranoia.  Verant
has a fucking bug in the poll software, alright?  Or perhaps VI should add
an option to their poll -- "I don't want to fucking tell you the asnwer to
this question" button.

Un...

Fucking...

Beleivable!

/em shakes head in disgust.

Dark Tyger = proof our educational system needs MAJOR overhaul right now!
