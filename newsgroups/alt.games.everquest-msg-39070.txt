Heck, I'm 50 and have never been on a proper raid. Small guild, the
strict limitations on my playing hours, and the fact that most pickup
raids on my server are in the US morning hours when I can't play (the
Naggy raid I could have gone on was canceled because of the
Stonebrunt patch) keep me from going. And before you start whining
about soloing druids, I've grouped 95% of the time so far.

For me, raids will be when I get higher (and another guild perhaps)
and when I become able to play less rigid hours so I can go on long
raids on weekends.
