Heh, when I was low level the armor we were wearing was so crappy that
even Holy Armor (or Blur from an Enchanter) was a welcome buff.  When
you're tanking while wearing a mix of Cloth and Patchwork Leather you
refuse no buff.  :)

Well, my main is a Paladin, and I cannot recall ever not being "in
the zone" when fighting xp giving mobs.  If, when soloing, I don't
use my AC buff, life gets harder.

Well, that argument is easy to understand.  When you're using CHeal
and agro is controlled to the point where almost all of the damage
is being taken by a single tank it won't matter very often if you
slightly reduce the rate at whch that tank is taking damage.  I don't
experience the luxury of Cleric healing very often tho, so it wasn't
quite as obvious to me.
