Could you perhaps expand on this a bit ? I play a druid that has, for the
most part, solo'd her way to 36. I do however play with a regular group once
a week where I am the only healer, so by default I go into cleric mode. The
group consists of a ranger, a warrior, an enchanter, and myself. Ive so far
played the role of healer with spot crowd control when the enchanter gets
overwhelmed, and Str, and DS  buffs for the tanks, and the once every 20
mins or so a Group Skin spell. So far its worked out well. No deaths except
for when the tanks WAY over pull ;)

However, in a group that already has a cleric, which is a FAR better healer
then my druid, what role would I be expected to play ? Obviously I can still
throw buffs and DS's at the tanks, but what else would I do ? I would think
for prolonged fights my dots would be usefull, and for shorter fights my
nukes would be appropriate. Does a Druid become a secondary damage dealer,
and spot healer oin such a group ? Or should I concentrate on being a Ghetto
shammie, and apply what buffs that I Can ( Str, Regen, DS's etc. )

Any light you could shed on the subject would be greatly appreciated!!
