That's an interesting point because I've been thinking about that
recently.  I came to the conclusion that I wouldn't have been playing
WoW if it wasn't for EQ2.  I was happy with EQ and wasn't looking at
replacing it in any way (I discovered it late and my highest character
was level 36 - I had lots left to do).  Along came EQ2 and it looked
really cool - I don't think that it would have caught my attention if
it wasn't a sequel.  I tried it and it didn't keep my attention long
but I didn't move back to EQ - I moved to WoW which I am still playing
and enjoying lots.
