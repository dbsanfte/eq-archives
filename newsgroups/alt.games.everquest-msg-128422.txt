Whenever I "try" to play EQ I get disconnected like every 15 mins or so.  I
have a cable modem and it's hooked into a Linksys 4-port router.  It has to
be the router cause I can play fine if the modem is hooked right into my PC
instead of the router.  What could be causing this?  And how can I fix it?
BTW this just started happening like a few months back, before it was fine
using this same router.
