And here I was about to go whining about the death penalty at levels 51+.

Here's the facts:

At level 52 my enchanter loses a half of a yellow bubble (or thereabouts).
In an hour, in a good group, in a good xp zone, with a good constant supply
of critters, I gain less than a half of a BLUE bubble.  Without a rez,
without sleep, without taking a break, without losing any of my groupmates I
can earn back that death in only 5-7 hours.  With a 56 rez I lose only about
an hour.  With a 49 rez about 1.5 hours.  I shudder to think how much time
is lost if I get a 39 rez.

When a level 27 player asks the cleric I sometimes play (my brother's 57th
level) for a rez you know what I tell 'em?  "LOL, go kill a bat!"

But yes, I do remember being level 27 for the first time, and I do know that
death sucks, even back then.  I also remember learning how to avoid death
whenever possible...something you're undoubtedly learning.  And it's a
necessary lesson.
