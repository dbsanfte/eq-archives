You will not evade me, "-Martin" <villaat@cheerfuldot.com>:

You didn't see our first Doze attempt (we haven't quite figured him
out yet with our not-quite-enough people, and have had a resident
uberguild run over us to get him at least twice) when I was the only
druid present, it was around 5 am here, and my guildleader was begging
me to stay long enough for at least one attempt - it seemed he wanted
my resist buffs and resist/atk debuffs. Succoring people from HoT when
mobs gate is fun, too.
I need a raid tonight, haven't been to one in forever (or so it
feels).
