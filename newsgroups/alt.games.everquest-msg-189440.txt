    update: got the items back after 1 week 1 day, my original email
actually did the job, so i need never have petitioned OR sent a second
email. But being that i never got a REPLY to that email until they fixed it
a week later, i guess I can be excused for petitioning etc.

    I think if its going to take them a week to get your items back (and
that's too long imo) they should reply to your email saying "yes we'll check
the logs with regards to this before they expire". Would've taken a load off
my mind.

    As I've said in another post tho, if GM backlog is that big they should
hire more GMs and/or look into making log queries more powerful/convenient.

Cheers,
James
