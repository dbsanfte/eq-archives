Urm, yes, that is why I said a *preprogrammed* option, as in something you select before
you go linkdead as a general preference, stored server side? Maybe in the options
screen, right beside chat filters and display options? Multiple choice or macro'ed like
a hot key; ie casters could choose to chain cast gate if the server detected they they
were LD, as opposed to having them stand there and try to melee like morons?  Of course
you couldn't select it *after* you went LD!
