Yikes.  Maybe I'll try Warrior, SK, or Paladin instead, then.

Speaking of Rangers, they seem to make lousy tanks.  My Druid
often plays the role of Ghetto Cleric.  I'm mostly in mid-
to upper-30's groups these days, and I hate it when a Ranger
tries to be MT.  They require TONS of healing, they just get
pounded so damn much.

But boy, you get a Ranger in a group that already has an MT,
and watch the damage fly.  Mobs go down noticably faster with
Ranger damage added in.

But, Rangers sound like too much keying for me.  I've got
twitch games if I'm in the mood for that.

I'm surprised macro programs that feed input into EQ don't exist
to further automate things...

I played a Mage to 30 and found group playing fairly easy, with
the right macros setup of course.

The hardest part was teaching people about line of sight spells.
That was hard enough...I can't imagine being an Enchanter trying
to teach people about assisting...
