The way I see it, is that this isn't really a nerf.  Nobody has lost
anything by this.  You can go get XP in exactly the same zones you did
before, and channel it into AA, just like you did before.  However, if you
want to continue to level, you have to go elsewhere.  The catch?  Leveling
beyond 60 wasn't available before, so in effect, those who choose to
continue as they have before will see no change.

In short, new levels, new rules, same levels, same rules.
