You know, the other day I was playing my little enchanter and I
couldn't for the life of me work out where to get some of my
new illusion spells... so I sent a little tell to an enchanter
a few levels above me...

"Excuse me sir gnome! I'm terribly sorry to interrupt, lad, but m'far
from Akanon and miss me clockworks. Could y'offer an ol gnome a few
words of advice?"

Now, I was only going to ask for advice. Literally. Instead the
advice I got offered was how I should damn well work for my stuff
like everyone else, go kill things and loot, etc,etc.

Sigh ;)
