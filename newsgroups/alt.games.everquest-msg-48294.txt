So do RP'ers.  I saw nothing wrong with the reward on the mail quest. 
It was a very viable way to raise money to buy your spells as a spell
caster.  Why don't you deserve a reward for delivering mail?  As a
caster it's somewhat hard to kill things if you don't have your spells,
so doing the bats to cash isn't always an option and if you ask me there
is less role playing in that than there is in being asked to deliver a
letter.
