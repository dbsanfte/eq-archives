I'm going to assume you meant to type "but I'd say Amiga was better than
Macintosh" here, since the C64 was a very limited 8-bit machine, and the
Macintosh was a very capable 16-bit machine.

MacOS fell behind Windows (technology-wise) when Windows 95 was
introduced.  It stayed well behind Windows (technology-wise) until
MacOS X came out.

At this point, I'd give MacOS X the edge over WinXP in some areas, and
WinXP the edge over MacOS X in some areas.

If you define "best" as "has the most market share", sure, but Windows
isn't the best in all areas.

PC games offer a better gaming experience, in my opinion.  And since I
always have a reasonably modern PC anyway, buying an additional piece of
hardware for gaming doesn't make much sense.
