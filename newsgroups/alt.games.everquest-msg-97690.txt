I just hope this wasn't VI's solution to balancing the mage class. Seems
like one mage for a huge raid could do all the summoning of these items.
Matter of fact i don't see many folks saying oh lets get a mage in our group
so they can summon some of those items. More likely they will send a mage a
tell asking for an item. But on the other side, nice little items.
