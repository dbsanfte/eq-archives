You seem to be doing better than I am, at any rate :)

I started an Iksar monk yesterday.  I *love* the HP regen.  I don't know 
if I'll ever be able to play other races ever again *g*  Anyway, I was 
running back and forth from Cabilis to FOB doing the curscale skin quest 
to get armor when I got a tell from someone saying they were bored, and 
would I like them to PL me.  I said thanks, but no thanks, I liked doing 
the newbie thing.  And it's true - I get bored much more easily at level 
19 than I do at level 2.  Annnnnyway - I suppose he looked around and 
nobody else wanted to be PL'd either, cause he soon walked up and asked 
to inspect me while I was fighting something.  I said go ahead, he 
inspected, then asked me to go with him to the bank so he could give me a 
few things.  I thought "alright, curscale armor without having to find 
these stupid pups for hours on end" (is it just me or are those about the 
rarest spawn in the newbie area?  And if you're not the only one doing 
the quest.. yikes!) and followed him happily.  He gave me a (cured, I 
think?) silk veil and said oops, that's all I have, but let's get you a 
1HB too, raced off to the monk guild, and bought me a staff.  Then he 
showed me the guy to talk to in order to get the second shackle, and took 
me to get a few components for that - couldn't find any, so we went to 
the pit in the middle of the FOB and he brought in his druid and started 
mega-buffing me, and had me kill stuff there.  After awhile I went "hey, 
waitaminute..." but by that time I was fairly grateful to him for showing 
me the extra quest and helping me out, so I ended up getting PL'd to 
level 5.  The only problem at that point was, well, I *should* have been 
able to fight some of the stuff in the arena at the point when he left, 
*but* I couldn't hit worth beans.  My h2h skill was something like 3 at 
the time.  I went around fighting scorpions, low blue, but the skill 
wasn't going up, wasn't going up, wasn't going up - after about TEN kills 
it would go up a level, and that was with me avoiding using kick, which 
went up much faster (actually *everything* goes up much faster than h2h).  
So I ran to the guild, threw 10 points into H2H and came back - *much* 
better.  Problem is it's *still* a very slow-raising skill.  I can't 
understand why it takes so much longer than anything else to up when I'm 
using it almost exclusively.

I love round kick, although it tends to freeze my screen for a second 
when I go around, and I LOVE safe fall *g* once I got that I spent about 
an hour jumping off higher and higher towers, trying to get in as much 
damage as I could - then, thanks to HP regen, waiting 60 seconds and 
starting again :).

Anyway, what I'm wondering is, will removing the staff from my secondary 
slot (why does that sound vaguely dirty?) get my h2h skill up faster?  
And secondly, how the heck did a level 4 monk I was talking to manage to 
get to Qeynos to up faction there??
