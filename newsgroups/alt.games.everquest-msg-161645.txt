AFAIK, dex affects how often a weapon procs its affect, which seems to fit
in with my experience using a Bloodclaw on my Necro.  But what about
Vampiric Embrace, the Necro/SK lifetap proc spell?

It's a "proc" so dex should affect it, but I'm not sure it does?  I haven't
done extensive testing (yet), but after boosting my lvl 18 Necro's dex upto
125 the bloodclaw goes off noticeably more often while I don't notice much
or any change in how often VE goes off?

Does anyone know for sure if dex does or does not affect Vampiric Embrace
procs?  Maybe it would be more obvious to a SK who's procing much more in
general?

Thanks
