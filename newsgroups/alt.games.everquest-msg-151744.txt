Yeah your right, just getting the 30s burnout
I didnt realise it slowed quite so much as this.
Im guessing in the late 50s then it might take a week of heavy playing 
to get just 1 level?
All the time ive been playing as long as ive been attacking whites or 
yellows ive been getting about 1 bubble per kill and at level 35 now it 
has been a nightmare level.
I guess i was thinking it was going to be easier if i just chose the 
right class, but i guess if this slowing is meant to happen to every 
class ill have to have a ithink about whether i want to bother anymore
Id love to get to level 60 with a character though.
Is quad kiting the answer to my problem for now?
if i kill 4 dark blues with quadding will that gain me a bubble a kill 
or more?
I dont mind the effort or time that i need to put into this game but i 
like to see reasonable progress.
I think also part of the problem which ive mentioned in other posts is 
ive found im not wanted in groups usually but hopefully a good guild 
will sort that part
