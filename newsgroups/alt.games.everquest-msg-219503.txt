That sucks.
I have all the expansions, i love exploring new zones but i love to go 
back and putter on quests and tradeskills. i am a 250 GM jeweler, and 
200 in everything else except tailoring [working on it, am at 133 now] 
and when i get to 65 i will do new taanan skill aas so i can get 
everything to 250=)Then i will make myself the various pop 
ubertradeskill goodies=)
