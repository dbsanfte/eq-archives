Those are really pretty ok. 35 hp on the arms is nice. Its not that
its less than a single blow but that you can have a kit which gives
you plus a ton o' hp by having such items. This is what my druid is
going for now since, like you, it has wis usually near max or at max
with c3. Most new items I get are solely based on AC/HP (mostly HP,
druid stuff doesn't usually get that high ac anyway) and possibly
mana. If the thing also has 5 or 10 to resists its a bonus too.

The thurg stuff is just not as good as tov though (especially the
stats on the skyshrine quest stuff, though kael is higher in ac) and
maybe you should just save the gems for tov.
