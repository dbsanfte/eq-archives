Perhaps a more relevant question than it would at first appear.  There are 
those who theorize that Str is a more important stat for skilling up 
smithing than Int or Wis.  Getting very drunk will raise your Str at the 
cost of Int and Wis.  So smithing while drunk may actualy be a good way to 
skill up.  Especially if you're a follower of Brell...  The only real 
difficulty is trying to hold on to the forge while you do so.
