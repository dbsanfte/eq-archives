WOW...big mistake!

1. If you solo you can always run away from the mob when OOM and just
sit and med. The worst that could happen is losing the kill and zoning.
Getting
an extra root or snare off in this case could save life - alteration wins!

2. If youï¿½re the nuker in a group and does nothing else it would be bad to
be OOM of course, but what kind of lousy group would suffer from the dr00d
not getting one blast off? It certainly wont kill anyone! Getting an evac or
heal
off could save the entire group - alteration wins!

Wether a druid solo or group alteration is the lifesaving line of spells and
evocation is the look-what-I-did line of spells. If you stick to low blue
mobs
you wont be OOM very often and if you do - big deal... just sit and med :P

When I solo giants the most manaeating spell I use is root!
