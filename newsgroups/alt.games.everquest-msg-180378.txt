Ive got Obligatory Hendrix Perm, and the inevitable pinhole burns
all down the front of my favorite satin shirt
Ive got nicotine stains on my fingers, Ive got a silver spoon on a
chain
Got a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains

The part I dont understand is the obligatory hendrix perm. Was he
referring to the hairdo that most rock stars seemed to get? Silver
spoon on a chain? wtf?
