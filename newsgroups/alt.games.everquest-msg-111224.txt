 We killed him the first day of Luclin. It was easy back then. He could
be pulled to the zone, didn't have that many HPs and hit like a wimp. It
was fun seeing him updated with every patch until the perma-rooted mob
he is today. I think we have one of the original monk weapons before
they nerfed them by adding to the delay or dropping the damage, forgot
which. Risk vs reward just doesn't add up on him now. They went from one
extreme to another. We still kill him if nothing else is up but
otherwise we don't bother.
