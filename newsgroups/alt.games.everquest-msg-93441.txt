    Gah, this raises questions as well as answering them. Consider the
phrase "as if it was an additional party member". Now consider a level 30
mage with a level 24 pet and a level 30 paladin friend. The pet outdamages
the mage and the paladin on a kill (it was offtanking). Which of these
describes how XP is computed and distributed:

(My belief) (1) The pet takes 24/(24+30+30) of the XP, the XP bonus is
computed for a two person group.
(2) The pet takes 24/(24+30+30) of the XP, the XP bonus is computed for a
three person group.
(3) The pet takes 1/3rd of the XP, the XP bonus is computed for a two person
group.
(4) The pet takes 1/3rd of the XP, the XP bonus is computed for a three
person group.

    I base numbers three and four on the old "pet takes 50% of XP if it
outdamages solo mage" theory. Some day, Verant will answer simple questions
with exact formulas. Some day. I hope.
