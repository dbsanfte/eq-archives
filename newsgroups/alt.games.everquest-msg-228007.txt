To add some perspective... heres where im coming from.
I've done "2 types" of ldon hard adventures so far... bot central, friends
groups, with me 2boxing the shaman, the cleric 2boxing a ranger (mains
potime geared, bots in luclin/ornate/trash gear), and 2 friends in mostly
velious armour... pretty big gear gap, and overall the average would be
somewhere around ssra level, if you could even out the gear..

That had been my only LdoN hard experience infact until yesterday, and we've
met pretty good success.. 6-1 or so (go go failure, doing a 23 collect and
being stuck at 1 to go with 22 mins to go).  Its a rough ride thats for
sure, but has major fun factor (I always enjoy the mad struggles for some
reason!)

Last night we did some hard, minus the bots, using all guildies (potime
gear).. it was trivial. 22 collect win in 30 mins, in mirag/hard. Similar
results in EC/hard

Both group makeups had pulls of 1-4 mobs at random intervals during the
dungeon.. last night we had a chanter to mez adds.. the "gimp group" had
root (which if botted players can do, nobody has an excuse)

Its not insanely hard imo, whatever your gear era.. in the first group setup
i tank (monk) maybe 65% of mobs to 35% that the warrior (7.x k hp luclin
armour, less than 20 aa's) tanks... if for nothing else, because of the agro

If you have the ldon-easy mindset then you are in for a rude awakening...
but if you remember what you learnt when you first discovered PoP.. PoV mobs
hitting for 600!!!! Omg the shock at that, learning curve and readjustment..
I would say ldon hard mobs are no more difficult than solro/poearth mobs.
The only difference is pop pulling is far more controlled...

We do ldon hard because its a decent challenge (compared to ldon easy.. not
other stuff we've killed maybe).. loot is just a bonus for me.  If your on
the ball (the 60+ heals were all huge fast cast heals for a reason) and
don't try to cheal at 30% each mob.. have a brain to position the mobs away
from rooted adds.. a group in velious gear could and would rock the
difficult adventures imo
