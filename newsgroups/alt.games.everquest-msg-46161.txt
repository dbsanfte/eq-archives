There's a guy in the first group of buildings in the Northern Desert
of Ro that carries Large Sewing Kits. They have a capacity of 8 slots.
You will notice that some Wu's armour has 9 ingredients. For these,
you have to find a Loom (like an oven or forge). I think there is one
on the second floor of either Trader's Holidy or Velith and Bardo
Imported Goods.

Hope that helps
