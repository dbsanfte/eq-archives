This afternoon a change went in that essentially removes the boat from
Butcher to Freeport and the boat from Butcher to FV.  Now there are gnomes
called Translocators whom you hail (a la Soulbinders) and the port you to
one of their colleagues in the respective oceans.  From there, you hail the
next Translocator to move on down the line.

If this was intended as a short term fix to the boat issues, it will
backfire.  Folks will no longer be willing to take the boat ... and I'm sure
they realize this.
