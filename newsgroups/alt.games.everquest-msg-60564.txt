First off, you can't increase your skill if the mob you're fighting
won't give you XP. Therefore soloing is not a good option.
Here is what I would do. 
Equip both hands with HS weapon. Look for the fastest dont worry for the
damage. Try to find a group (around your level that is fighting at least
blues for you) and ask them if you can practice your HS skill on their
pulls. There is NO WAY you can KS a group so the group will most likely
say yes.
If there is a SHM ask him to buff your DEX.
If there is ENCH or SHM ask to get Haste buff.
If you can borrow some haste items. They are stackable with Haste buffs.
Safe and easy way to practice your HS skill. And it a good idea to want
to max it out since Ranger EPIC are HS :)
