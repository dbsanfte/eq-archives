OK, now that they're doing away with the need for CR for characters under 
level 10, how long before we get the first post here saying, 'EQ is 
bugged.  My level 10 <char> died and popped up at his bind point WITHOUT 
ANY GEAR!  Those fucktards at Verant couldn't code their way out of a wet 
paper bag! Etc, etc!'?
Oh, and I can't wait to see what people think of their EXP bar movement 
when they hit 51, if they've never dealt with a hell level before.
