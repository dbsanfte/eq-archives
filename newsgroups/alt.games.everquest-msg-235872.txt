Well, you could use the normal way of assisting. Target the warder and
type /assist (or just have a hotkey that simply says "/assist" and
target the warder then hit it). "/assist preyying's" might work, too.
Except in raid situations where the MT might not be in your group,
I've found just the generic "/assist" hotkey is better all around,
though.
