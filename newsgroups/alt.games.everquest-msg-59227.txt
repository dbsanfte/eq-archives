Because it's football. A sport.  War is not a sport be it in game or
real form. It's War. War is all about using what you can to win. Thats
the rules. Is it fun? In the case of reality no. In games it sure can
be. Outsmarting an opponent who overpowers you, surprise attacking a
guy who thought he had the situation in hand, recovering from an
ambush and turning it into a rout, all of those are the gaming moments
you will remember fondly for years. And losing, well it happens to
everyone, you go in knowing that. The best you can do is learn from it
and not make the same mistakes. 

I really would encourage you to get halflife with Team Fortress
Classic bundled and try it out on some of the better servers, like the
USMC one and Yiffies foxies. Dying doesn't have to be painful it can
be Glorious. :-)
