Well when I mention stuff, I'm not referring to uber items and things you need
to get to be super powerful eg.,  I just mean loot in general dropping from 
monsters. Stuff you collect and keep the odd item or sell. I've never done the
camping thing in any of the MMORPG'S I've played, I just like a reward for the 
kill and the ability to take a break from combat and go to a store and buy and 
sell stuff. Something to do other than combat. I like the idea of having an 
inventory or bank and being able to have possessions, even it's a flower 
or rock found or dropped from a monster.

I can't see CoH having legs if there's only one thing to do, fight, with no 
economy, trade or crafting.

I started the game a few days ago, and already I didn't even have the urge to 
play it at all yesterday. I think back to Sept 97 on the first day of UO, or a 
couple years later with EQ, and further down the road with AC or DAoC or 
AO etc. I couldn't wait to hurry home to play those games for a long time, but 
with CoH I find myself asking what's the point ?

I am happy you enjoy it though, it's great to find a game we like.

Jim
