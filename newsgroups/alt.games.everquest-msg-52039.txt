There are an abundance of fabulous Kael quests that can be done solo
(depending on class), or with a small group. The only "uberness" required
is for the high end quests: Dain/Yelinak heads, or the armor quests...and
hunting in West ToV is no more difficult than the halls of testing...PLUS
you can hit the nameds in there for some drops...only quest items drop in
HoT.

I don't consider dorf quest armor to be a valid reason to ally with the
coldain. The ring quest is a reason, and so is tradeskill access, but when
you can get essentially identical armor from PoG/2nd floor Hate, I just
don't see the point. The point of conflict is between kael and skyshrine
quest armors, and there is little difference in difficulty in obtaining
them, except that kael armor requires non-KOS status with Tormax, where
dragon followers can let their yelinak faction rot.

The dain is easier than tormax. Not so much because of the mob himself, but
of the relative ease of pulling, and difficulty of the surrounding guards.
Better drops too, by and large. Tormax's head yields amazing caster boots
from yelinak, but having to get high yelinak faction is a nuisance
(although I hear the faction boost to yelinak for killing tormax is
substantial).
