Doing the same thing myself...I've already put close to 800pp to get my
skills up...you'll probably never get back what you put into it...

I'm strictly doing it for my guild...I figure when my skills are acceptable
to make things that are needed...my guild will supply me with the components
and I will make what they want and in the process build my skills to the
next lvl...
