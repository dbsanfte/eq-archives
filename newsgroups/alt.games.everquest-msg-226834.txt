That's pretty much it... "Who cares?"  Every time you bring out
class-specific complaints, all the other classes are gonna jump all over you
and point out all the other advantages you have.  It doesn't matter which
class you are, you're just not going to get any sympathy.  Hey, we all have
ways we wish our class could be better, why are your concerns any more
important than ours?  Answer *that* one, neh?

About the only class that garners genuine sympathy is Warriors, who nearly
everyone agrees have real balance issues.  Hopefully the melee changes will
address this.

> 1) Ports devalued with PoP and now LDoN

Pfft.  C'mon, for every druid who mourns the fact that they aren't in demand
any more for ports, I'll find you one that's relieved they don't get
pestered with tells for ports.  This is hardly a universal concern.

> 2) Many spells indoor only so useless in LDoN

So?  Don't LDoN then.  You had the same problem with *any* indoor zone you
tried to XP in.  If that's a concern to you, don't LDoN.  Besides, many many
of your spells *are* useful indoors.  I have yet to group with a druid in an
LDoN group who complained that they had no useful spells to cast.

> 3) Soloing devalued with the new bonuses for grouping

Heh, well, I'm a cleric.  I can maybe solo some dark blue undead in The
Grey - if I don't mind getting one percent AA every five minutes.
 Warriors - hah, they can't solo a light blue.

If you're coming here asking for sympathy because people who group get more
XP than you do, you're simply not going to get any sympathy.

Sony intended that the game be played by groups.  They allowed for soloing,
but they didn't want soloing to be better than grouping.  That's why they
added the group bonuses.  You, at least, can still get good XP soloing.  Me,
I either find a group or I whittle away the hours cliff-diving from the
PoAir entrance in Tranquility.

> 4) Not valued as main healers by parties in most cases

Well, this I simply have to disagree with.  Druids *are* valued as good
healers.  In plain ol' XP groups, very often groups prefer druids to clerics
because druids add DPS on top of their healing.  I just don't see a basis
for this particular complaint, sorry.

Oh, well, there you go.  Most of the active player bases is 60+, and Sony
tends to balance the game at those levels.  You may notice a lot of long dry
spells along the way where you fall way behind in certain aspects.  Tough it
out for now... 39-51 is a breeze, really.  Once you get to 51 the XP will
slow down, but you'll have a lot more neat spells that will make you a
welcome addition to the party.

> Just my 2c.  Feel free to add your own ;-)

Honestly, you haven't yet reached the level of the game where you can really
effectively judge overall balance.  It's like an eleven-year-old kid
complaining about how tough management in-fighting is at a Fortune 500
company.  Sure, you can read up it, maybe even make some intelligent
observations.  But really, you should try experiencing it before forming an
opinion.  Give your druid an honest shot at levels above 50 and decide then
if you enjoy playing it or not.
