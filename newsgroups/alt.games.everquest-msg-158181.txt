Occasionally, someone asks for a good way to earn plat.  A common answer is
to hunt X which drops Y, which sells for good plat to other players.  It
occurs to me that that raises an obvious question: where do the people that
buy items like that get their plat?  Players selling things to other players
never creates plat...it just shuffles it around.

Where does the plat actually come from?  Offhand, I can only think of three
sources:

1. Coin drops off mobs.

2. Selling stuff to vendors.

3. Rewards for quests.

I wonder what the distribution of plat sources is?  E.g., what mob's deaths
contribute the most?  Any guesses?
