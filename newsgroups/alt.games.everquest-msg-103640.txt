PIII 750, 384MB Ram, lame 8mb 3D video.  Ph33r the mighty Savage/MX
video subsystem! 
Ok, not *that* lame - this thing wasn't purchased to play EQ after
all!  However, before the new models it played EQ wonderfully.  Since,
SoL, it still plays EQ wonderfully - with all models off, sky off,
lowest detail setting at 1024x758 (panel's native resolution).  Heh,
sure wish that video card was upgradeable in some realistic fashion.

I suspect with one of the newer 'real' laptop video systems you'll be
just fine.

Works in a pinch though, and that's good enough for me when on the
road.
