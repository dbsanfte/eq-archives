I beat Exe trial the very first time I tried it.  Have been helping people
get flagged ever since.

The last time I did it, the cleric didn't have to heal the MT even once on
the boss.

I've never lost if we make it to the final boss, and that includes the time
where I was stuck tanking him because the main tank *and* the cleric were
mezzed (though that one was pretty close, monks don't make great tanks these
days).
