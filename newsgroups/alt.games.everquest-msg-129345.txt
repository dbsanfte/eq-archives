Yeah, like most things computer related there seem to be at least a million
things to consider before you find the root of the real problem, so consider
scrutinizing your PC carefully.

Make sure all those cute little apps are closed when you start EQ (I always
bury myself with virus-scan on Thursday nights). Make sure any new programs
or hardware you have installed hasn't altered your OS, PC or LAN is some
"new and profound way". Although unlikely, your ISP could be having
problems, so consider asking them about performance issues.

Good Luck!
