AD&D?! Good god, what right-wing radical fundamentalist nutjobs wrote
that filter? They're still stuck on the "RPGs are tools of the devil
that lead kids to suicide, murder, and DEVIL WORSHIP!" bullshit or
something? If I were an AOL customer, I'd be writing to them to bitch
about that for sure. As well as the others. I can understand parenting
filters blocking full on swear words and sexual content, but these are
prudish in the extreme...
