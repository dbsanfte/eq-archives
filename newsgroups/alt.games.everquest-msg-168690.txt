Hmm, I've noticed no aggro at all.

On double pulls at OC in POV, I frequently Darb as my first "cheal" with two
unslowed mobs beating down the pally MA.  He's bow tagged the designated
target, the monk has FD'd to dump the pair to him, neither mob is yet slowed.
So the add has no hate except the incedental hate for the paladin having
attacked his buddy.  This is a guaranteed recipee for heal aggro anywhere, and
POP zones are notorious for heavy heal aggro.

Yet the mobs both stick faithfully to the MA... who then uses HWOPrexus to
seal their interest so the shaman can slow.

This strategy was head and shoulders more successful than others we tried in
terms of making sure the MA kept aggro solidly.  Supernal Remedy is very close
to CHeal level aggro, I don't have Supernal Light yet but I wager its even
worse.   Supernal Elixer is a very low aggro strategy, its possible that this
too would allow me to get away with healing while an untaunted add was in the
room, in fact I use it for this a lot.  But I wouldn't say "massive aggro" if
all I meant was "more aggro than a HOT"

I'm not even convinced its more aggro than a HOT, that will take some
deliberate testing.

First thought is, I'll group with someone who can solo a faction kill mob that
I"m not KOS to, use Darb partway thru the fight, do nothing else, and see if I
take a faction hit or if the mobs change con to KOS to me at all.  My
impression is that there's literally zero aggro and I won't be put on the hate
list at all for DArb, but I could easily be wrong about this.

Second thought is, have MA aggro a deeply green mob, and then do nothing.
I'll cast HOTs on him till I pull the mob off.  Then atone a few times, get
the mob back on the MA with the same aggro, and use DArb and see if I can
taunt off with that.

Any other ideas for testing this out?
