I know, I know, whenever they do an update, they spend a lot of time 
patching up after themselves.  But honestly, 5 hours?  They've been 
running for a couple days after the patch, so whatever they are fixing 
can't be catastrophic.  I wouldn't have been surprised at a ten minute, 
or even half hour.. heck, an hour wouldn't be out of the question.

Five hours, though, thats longer than the typical 3 hour "scheduled 
mainenance" time block!

I know, I know, there's a lot more involved than I know about, playing 
with the guts of the game is a complex undertaking, and they've gotten 
good at estimating how long its going to take.

So I'm not really complaining, just venting; I had to log out before my 
customary death! (I've been getting in at least one per day since I 
started playing again)
