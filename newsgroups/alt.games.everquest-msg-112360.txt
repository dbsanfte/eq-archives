Soloing is harder?  When did that happen?  I didn't notice the transition.
I'm happy to report that I still find it relatively easy to solo dk blues at
level 53.

The test of patience was a piece of cake except for the killer shark that I
had to run off somewhere far away giving me time to talk to the NPCs.  I
agree that the bear camp is much worse than any of the epic quest camps for
the shaman.
