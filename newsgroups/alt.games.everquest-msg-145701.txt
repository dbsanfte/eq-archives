I don't think it's rude at all.  Do a "/showspelleffects off" if spell effects lag you
too much in the bazaar.  God knows there are plenty of things that can lag you
there, with spelleffects being maybe 20% of the total picture.

For me, playing a song while trading worked out really well because I could use the
time to work on a particular instrument skill.  I just recently reached 235 in all
my instrument skills, so I won't be doing it anymore.
