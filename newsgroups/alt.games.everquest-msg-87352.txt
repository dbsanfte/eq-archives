It's not an exploit.  A long time ago they changed a lot of faction issues
and the wolf form thing was well known to them at that time.  They chose not
to change it.

Of course, they made up for it by making wolves KOS pretty much everywhere
on Kunark and certainly it doesn't help you in Velious.  I haven't even
tried it yet on the moon.
