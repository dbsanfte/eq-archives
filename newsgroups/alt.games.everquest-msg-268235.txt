However, doing so gives analysis problems.

Try it this way:

There are roughly 5 fish spawns in the pond and another 2 or 3 in the ocean.
Once they've filled up, they're static - they won't despawn and therefore
they won't affect anything you do on the land.  Yes, they take up 8
potential land spawns, but that's all they do.  In comparison there are over
30 land spawn points still in use.  (No, I didn't count them, that's an
estimate.  However, next time I find myself in an isolated Oakmyst
instance....)

Now, with them full and therefore locked out, any further spawns *can't* be
of fish, as it doesn't (knock wood) spawn fish on land.  So, if you now run
around and harvest every land node you come across, all of the ones you
harvest will be replaced with other land nodes.  Thus, you'll get a
reasonably accurate respawn rate for the land nodes and, if you keep track
of the different types you get, a good run at type frequencies if you do it
long enough.

I kept track of only the Grizzled Arbor, and as I said, I was running into
them about one every 5 minutes.
