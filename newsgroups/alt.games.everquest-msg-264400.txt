Yeah, that kind of dynamic BAF possibility is exciting and I'd like to see 
it too, although it can get annoying. Gating mobs in EQLive are a good 
example of when it gets annoying, but it also offers you a new tactical 
ability as you focus on stunning when the gate animations begin, etc. I'd 
welcome this kind of dynamic, but I haven't seen it yet at 20+.
