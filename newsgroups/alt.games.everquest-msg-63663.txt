As a proud recent member of Titan Lords, I'd like to note that TL
is one reason for that phenomenum... we've apparantly for some time
now made a point of getting in and dropping Naggy any time he
pops unexpectedly due to server repop, I've been in on at least
two of those, and the reason given is that phat lewt aside, the job
has to be done to keep the Ragefire spawn rate up.  If TL keeps
up the way it has been, you can expect Naggy to die the day he
pops, like clockwork.

More res sticks, in any guild, makes for a better world... and the
faster that list moves, the sooner some of our clerics get their sticks,
which makes for a better guild.

Not even on the bleeding list!  Then again, I've only been working
seriously on my epic for three days...halfway thru seems pretty good.
