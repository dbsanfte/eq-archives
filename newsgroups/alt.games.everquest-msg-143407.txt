Why should that be the idea?

Why shouldn't victims be segregated?

Its not a question of being biased, its a question
of the appropriate punishment being meted out for
the crime.

Even though the end result of all murders is the
same, in regards to the victim, this doesn't mean
that all murders are the same, nor does it mean
that the punishment should be the same.

There are many factors to take into account for
any particular crime; the victim, the perpetrator,
the motive, public opinion, likelihood to
re-offend, to name but a few. You cannot have a
blanket sentence for any given crime, and call it
just.

This is not bias, but taking due account of the
circumstances of the crime.
