They very simply did not want to have to worry about balancing the
difficulty of the dungeons. I am sure a diffrent team of programmers worked
on each of the 5 and thus no real balance would be possible. If you could
hunt any and spend anywhere you might notice everyone in one dungeon amd
have to change some stuff.

Ef, Ec, and MM can all be hunted with just a good puller no cc needed. Ef
has lethal traps, Ec has chealers and gaters and collections are screwed, mm
has occasional adds.

N ro has packed mobs behind doors, it is doable with just a good puller but
experience and aa may be required. Also elder beads help alot.

Guk is just weird. Cannot target mobs worth a damn.
