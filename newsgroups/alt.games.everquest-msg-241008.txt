You're using texture compression?   Delete all the .txc files in your
EQ directory and then run the game again.  I've had something similar
( notably the punk-rock wolves and the like.)

Course, if it's happening to the UI also, I'm not quite as certain.
I'd suggest just maybe re-installing the damn program and see if that
smartens things up.
