Ran from the entrance of HK to the Hafling city at night.  Was my first time
going through Kiticor at night.  I was a 15th Wizard at the time.  Hugged
the wall the whole time.  Was just getting to the entrance of the Hafling
city when I saw a knight standing there right in the middle of the entrance
to the city.  I thought, cool, he must be really high level to not be
worried and just standing there.  Suddenly, got hit with a spell blast, 300+
damage.  LOADING.....

Never have returned to (night) Kiticor to this day.
