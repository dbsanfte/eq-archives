 >Named wolves in DSP will attack Druids and Rangers on sight...

Oh, yes, I wasn't considering them since they have attacked
me. :) The ones who come to mind are Ashenpaw and Bristletoe
(even though he's a bear.) But I've seen other wolves attack
druids and rangers and they're not named. If they're being
attacked by wolves, is it a matter of faction and not being
wolves? As in, are some wolves aligned with a faction that
is automatically KOS to druids/rangers?
