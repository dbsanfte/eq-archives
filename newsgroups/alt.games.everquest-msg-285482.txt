Im aware that the largest instance in the expansion is 25 man, but they are 
patching these new UI changes well before the expansion, and there will 
still be 40 man raids for a variety of reasons. Even our high end guild will 
probably want to finish off our legendary staves which involves killing 
kel-thazud, and there will be call to farm sapphiron for the shoulder 
enchants.

Having said all that too, staring at 25 health bars still wont be fun.

Wrong realm unfortunately, but Ill have a gentlemans bet that the majority 
of raiding guilds wont be able to raid after the patch because the healers 
spit the dummy.
