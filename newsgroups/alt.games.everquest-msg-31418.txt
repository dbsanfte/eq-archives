And now we run into the morass.  You have just opened up the "I don't agree
with the law" argument.

Speeding?  Everyone does it and the speed limit should be higher.  Pot?
Never hurt anyone and, besides, I'm in the privacy of my own home.  Murder?
He was killing babies so I had the right...  Where does it end?  We (in the
US) are a nation of laws.  Without laws, we have chaos, at best.  Whether
you agree with the law (and the naming rules are the law of EQ) or not does
not matter to me.  Whether you follow the laws does.  You will be reported.
You will be caught.
