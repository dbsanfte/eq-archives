Heh. The GM /kill command when used on NPCs leaves no corpse behind.
Would be nice if they could do that to PCs who act like jackasses at
an event. Definately make them think twice about soiling the next
event if they lose all their ub3r g34r. Make it a triple xp loss kill,
too. ;-)

'course, then we'd get spammed with temper-tantrums over how a GM made
them lose all their gear. Boo-frickin'-hoo.
