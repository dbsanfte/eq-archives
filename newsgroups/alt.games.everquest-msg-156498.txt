 I feel the same way. Fellow guildmembers saying the nerf was a good
thing. Funny, it's going to affect them as well when they have to wait
longer on pulls becuase the puller just died. Again. Oh, and when they
start up XP groups and can't find one of their precious plate-classes
and want a Monk to fill in? Well they can piss off as far as I'm
concerened. No nerf is a good nerf. Just because it doesn't directly
affect your class doesn't mean it's not bad.

 Really? I saw that as more advertising for Verant. I was thinking
they'd get more customers after that.
