/showname 2

I think.  If it's not that try /showname 1 or 3.

Everyone else will still see them, but you won't.

Personally, I like the titles, I only need 3.72 more aa for MGB (for when I
get SotW) and the Elder title (or I could blow the points now on worthless
enhanced root) and I finally get to lose that stupid Venereal.. err..
Venerable title.

And with 9-11% aa per kill on froggies in PoStorms.  Please sir, may I have
another?  Elder by the end of the weekend hopefully.  (and I'll MGB wolf
form in bazaar right off!)
