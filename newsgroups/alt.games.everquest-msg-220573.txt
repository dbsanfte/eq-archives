Being able to wear cultural armor is huge for the plate classes.  High armor
class and often lots of stats.   For chain... not so much.    The cultural
chain armors aren't all that great.  In fact, in my searches of the E'ci
bazaar, I don't think there is even one person selling cultural chain armor.
Nor has there been since I reactivated my account.
