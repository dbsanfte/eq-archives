I Bot quite a bit even in Pickup Groups or with Guildies I do let them know
and I play a Warrior and Druid or a Warrior Cleric combo which for the most
part is easy and safe. I will have the Warrior Tank and Druid Buffs, Snare,
Dots and has Succor ready. This is explained to the group so they know what
to expect and I have the macros preset to work these functions. If a Healer
is needed then the Cleric Buffs and Heals, for the most part both are no
brainers and require very little attention. I would never attempt to Bot and
Enchanter or Bard due to the attention required to monitor the entire area
around the Group. If unable to find groups I have Botted all 3 without too
much difficulty using 2 machines and EQW on 1.
Tank pulls, establishes agro
Druid Snares, Dots sits
Clerics Heals, sits
