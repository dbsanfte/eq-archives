> You think you're gonna change my mind?

Ahh, you think this is a contest to change someone's mind? Of course it
isn't. It's simply a public airing of your inability to provide any kind of
support for your incorrect summation of the legal theory of consideration.

> Only difference is, I'll feel much better about it.

And this is where you reveal the true basis for your opinions. You're not
talking at all about economic or legal theory, you're really talking about
your own particular brand of social justice and what makes *you* feel good.

Thanks for the clarification, it really helps to put the rest of your
comments in context.
