Thank you Tim...I think I will!

All parts have been purchased...new Monitor and Keyboard are
here...countdown a week for the rest to arrive.  Incidentally, it is
rather sickening that I"m paying 1/4 the price now for a system that is
10x better than what I had before I quit...but that is the punishment I
pay for going the way of the "gaming laptop".  Now I know better. :)

I think I'm going to name my bright-red computer something having to do
with Poppies...the color is right, and what is EQ other than my own
personal Opium?
