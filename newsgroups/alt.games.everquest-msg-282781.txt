Like when their pacify stops working for a number of levels, and then stops
working entirely when it no longer gets upgraded.  I know pacify isn't
'class defining' for clerics but it's still a useful point.

I'm not saying Enchanters are moaning about nothing.  I'm saying, everyone
suffers the same issue in EQ at various stages.  All classes at some point
find that their class defining features are not useable for either some
levels, or in certain zones, or in entire sections of content.

My wife plays an enchanter, I'm more than aware of how frustrated she was
while trying to get the 69 mezz.  She was doing that when OoW was new and
when runes weren't rotting anywhere.  But she did get it, in a group in
RSS, one of the reasons being that in the two of the common rune dropping
camps in RSS you don't need to mezz anything but you still need to slow
mobs, haste yourself and use mana regen.
