No. Legally binding simply means there is nothing about the contract 
that renders it null and void. (Say it was signed by a minor then its 
not legally binding, say it was signed under duress then its not legally 
binding...)

A legally binding contract is simply a contract that is not invalid.

I'm asking you the same thing.

I thought it was a given that its a civil matter. Police don't get 
involved in any civil matters.

But:

"A contract is any promise or set of promises made by one party to 
another for the breach of which the law provides a remedy. The promise 
or promises may be express (either written or oral) or may be implied 
from circumstances. Typically, the remedy for breach of contract is an 
award of money damages intended to restore the injured party to the 
economic position that he or she expected from performance of the 
promise or promises (known as an "expectation measure" of damages)."


The law simply **allows** parties damaged due to breaches of a 'legally 
binding contract' to seek reparations. But at no time does the law 
expressly forbid breaking contracts.
