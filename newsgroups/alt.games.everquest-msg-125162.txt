I think that is a bit different.  Apples and oranges so to speak.  There is
nothing wrong with someone trying to get the best price he can for an item up
for *Auction*.  Usually an accomodation is arrived at in fairly short order,
and both parties end up satisfied.  At least that has been my experience.

To my mind, *Paying Well* *Will Donate* for a port is an entirely different
kettle of fish.  

At my level (and yours)  porting  others for payment is a royal pain in the
butt. If I have time, bored, not holding down a  sought after camp I'll do it
for nothing if the person is civil  and or  has a convincing need.

Earlier in by Druid career, I had been ripped off far to many times to not have
learned a lesson. If you are charging - accepting plat for a port, get it up
front . Period.  Don't place blame on the Druid. Place the responsibility where
it belongs -- on those who did the ripping off.
