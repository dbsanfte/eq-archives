Let me guess, don't have Harmshield memmed, right? You could log on, cast
Harmshield run, and FD when it wears off. You should be far enough away
atthat point to use the cheaty /q trick and he will go back to his normal
station, giving you a chance to log back on...  but like most Necromancers
you probably don't have Harmshield memmed, figuring FD will get you out of
trouble....
