    You're welcome.  Ultimately, though, I think the FAQ might have saved
me more time than I spent.  New players comes in asks a question that has
been asked hundreds of times before.  Before I would do my best to answer
the questions that I felt I was qualified to do so.  Now it goes like this:

Me: You might want to read the FAQ for this group.

Them: Oh cool, thanks, that was a great help!

    IMHO this is one newsgroup that really does need a FAQ.  I'm glad there
so many people who were willing to put time into it as well.
