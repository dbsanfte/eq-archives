Lvl 25 wood elf, was doing stuff around qeynos, did the halas wanted poster
quest, decided it was time to log....

Literally 1 second away from logging and a guard comes up and tries to hit
me, I dont know qeynos well and wasnt expecting this, and paniced, then I
was slain by some lieutenant.  The strange thing is that these guards were
at least indifferent to me and at the most amiable (I have slain lots of
gnolls in blackburrow for faction in Halas/Qeynos).

Does anybody have any idea why I was attacked?
