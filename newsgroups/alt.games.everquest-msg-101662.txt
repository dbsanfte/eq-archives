I make it a point to say May I please have a SoW? and sometimes I add
WHen you have a second, may I pelase have a SoW?
I ALWAYS use "thank you", "Thanks!" or "Thanks, can I offer you
anything?"

The reason I am here is because there are HUMANS at the other end of
the screen, and human intraction is the main reason why I play. If I
wanted to solo I'd be playing DAOC.

I always ask in a complete sentance, not always spelled right because
my main language isn't English, its C++, and I am too used to the
compiler catching my misspellings.

Besides, I saw a purple Iksar singing (and it keeps going in my
head!):

"We're talking 'bout Please and Thank You
'Cuz they're the Magic Words
If animals could talk
You'd hear the fishes and the birds all sayin'
Please and Thank You
'Cuz they're the Magic Words
((use 'em in the morning at noon or night 
'cuz it's a great way to be polite))
Please and Thank You are
the Magic Words"
