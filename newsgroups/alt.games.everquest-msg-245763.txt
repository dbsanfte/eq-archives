Good points.  Saying it's nor worth worrying about implied that you should
forget about it totally.  Wasnt the intention, but I was more trying to make
it clear that your not going to get MAXIMUM benefit until that point.

It's set up that even for lower levels your going to see SOME benefit, and
at a pretty reasonable cost.  Just dont expect it to make your game
noticably easier.  Getting a few pts of regen is probably the simplest and
most beneficial tribute skill to get for low levels - any healing helps :)
