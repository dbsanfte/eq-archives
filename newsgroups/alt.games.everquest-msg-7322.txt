I'm not sure how giving tailors even larger sewing kits nerfs the entire
skill. If you are referring to tailored backpacks being less appealing, they
might be, if you do not care about weight of the pack, or about the weight
reduction on what's inside. (Ogres, maybe?)

What bothers me about tailoring is what several people in East Commonlands
were complaining about during my game session tonight: the difficulty
finding materials. Baking, Brewing, Fletching, and Smithing all have
plentiful materials than can be easily purchased from vendors (at least for
pre-mastery items). For Tailoring we are reduced to /auctioning for hours on
end for spider & spiderling silk (along with every other tailor on the
server) while we scuttle about killing green spider(ling)s. Increasing my
Tailoring skill is taking many times longer than it took my Fletching
character to increase that skill, or my Baking chracter to increase that
skill. *Many* times longer, all because of the lack of materials. It is not
quite the best use of my time that I can think of.

Once again, my belief that Verant's programmers do not actually *play* EQ is
reinforced....

I don't suppose anyone knows of a vendor that simply *sells* silk threads
and silk swatches? I sometimes am able to buy two or three from a vendor who
bought them from a PC, but I have yet to find a reliable vendor source, or a
PC that could provide more than a half-dozen threads/swatches an hour...
