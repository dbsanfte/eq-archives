Sony recently proposed a free month to its former customers (and me among
them) .

After a small pondering, and after checking the gf didn't realise The Ugly
Beast From Hell was about to be downloaded again, i gave it a try.

Ooooh, old toons still here. Hullo, drood. Was it a rumor they removed the
66% on incoming dotkited mobs? (a few tiggies told me that yes)

Anyways, i played twice and dropped the thing, for the reasons decribed
above.

As i've been away for long, the difference in noob population was obvious to
me. Starting towns deserted, no one needing help, giving help.
I was surprised how much this took the pleasure away.

Inc/lom/ytm/20/holdpull/twitch?/60gtg/yaddayaddayadda at every lvl.

The only "smile moment" that i  had was when i was playing Carpal, my lowbie
bard.

CluelessRanger : g/ by the way, what are these funny blue sparkles that heal
us?
:-)

But that "good ol times" feeling was not nearly enough, and my eq is shelved
again.
