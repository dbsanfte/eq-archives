Aside from "powerleveling," something most will suggest you forego until
you've played longer and have gotten at least one character to higher
levels, there is no real way to level significantly faster.

Your slow leveling rate has to do with the time you play, nothing else. My
experience was much the same, and often remains such due to real life time
constraints. Here are a few things you can do:

1) Rather than play one hour a night, play three hours in one night every
three days. Or whatever. Try to play longer sessions, even if it means
playing less often. Longer sessions tend to be more productive because you
eliminate a lot of the "setting up" nonsense of finding a group, or a place
to hunt, or banking. Whatever.

2) Do not pay attention to other people's levels. You will see folks at
levels you will not attain even if you played five hours a day every day for
the next three months. It takes a while, and these people have dedicated a
lot of time to getting to the higher levels. Pay attention to your own fun
... if you don't, you will be so focused on catching others, you may miss
out on some experiences you'll regret missing

3) Meet people online, group with them, and stay in contact with them.
Nothing helps out your progress through the game than a good support staff,
so to speak.

More than anything, have fun. If you're not, there's no reason to play.
