I'm not the first.  You mean you've never heard:

Cthulhu loves me, this I know,
For the high priest tells me so.
He's our lord, all dank and wet.
He won't eat me, no not yet.

Didn't help in and of itself, but it showed the problem.  I had about 500
duplicate files, including one directory.  When I say duplicate, I mean 2
files both named eqclient.ini sitting right beside each other.

Microsoft's tech support being it's usual useless self, my eventual solution
(after talking to them for > 2 hours and finally being told "it's a hardware
problem") was to move as much of the EQ directory contents as I could to
another drive, wipe the directory totally, recreate, move back, and do a
detailed sweep when restarting EQ.  Took a while to get the 500 files back,
but got the game up and running finally.

Who knows, maybe it really is a hardware problem.  But so far my confidence
in XP Home's system tools, when they're really needed, is abysmally low.
