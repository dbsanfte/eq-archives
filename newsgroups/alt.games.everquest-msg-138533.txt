If it wasn't for some pretty durn good ac gear, my 54 rogue
would probably have higher AC than my 60 rogue.  My main
was born back when we thought stats meant something,
and of course from AD&D rogues needed DEX/AGI.

My alt focused on STR, simply to add to another "real"
stat that matters for a rogue...ATK.  ANYTHING I can find
that boosts my ATK, I'll drop AC for...of course, that's
because AC is already over the soft cap, and it's sorta
like the old way casters counted wis/int for mana purposes...
if I can find something that boosts my ATK without dropping
me below the AC soft cap, I'll switch.  But NOTHING will
get me below the cap...unless I find an AC -10 BP that
adds 10k to ATK...then I'll go solo Stanos again...

Damn, I miss the day that bane damage for rogues was
calculated incorrectly...
