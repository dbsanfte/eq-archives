Ah. Now, that must be it. Graeme is a bad shaman and you're a good
tank. Finally, the mystery is revealed.

All sarcasm aside, you're on your way to being the worst tank ever.
You have all the qualities of the top 3 worst tanks on my server. You
don't know your class. You don't know the game. You don't understand
aggro. You're stupid. And, you won't listen to people who clearly know
your class better than you do.

Congratulations on your accomplishment. Only a handful can aspire to
the title of worst ever.
