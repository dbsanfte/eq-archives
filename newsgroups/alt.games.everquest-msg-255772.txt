Playing in a boat group in Dulak (Oceancrasher), my berzerk hit 45 last 
night.

When the group broke up, I went to POK to train up, getting my next 
throwing axe, which is 34/31, dumping my saved training points (20 of 
em, apparantly its been a while) into Kick.

Tried zoning to POT, nope, have to be 46.

Saw a MGB KEI going off at Nexus stone, ran over there and it landed, 
raising my WIS up over 100 for the first time, which will be helpful for 
trade skills should I decide to do some (I think I need brewing 
eventually for coldain rings if I take them that high)

Also saw MGB Virtue and FO7 over at the shorty bank, went and did my 
banking there, yep, I'm still immune to those two; apparantly need level 47.

I can't remember seeing anyone even advertising Aego casting for cash in 
the past month, its all been Temp (which stuck since level one) or 
Virtue.  For the next two levels, I'd be eager to get Aego and Focus, 
I'll have to keep an eye out.

Funny thing is I might prefer SLN to POTG; POTG doesn't have a hp regen 
component to it does it?

What other fun buffs are available to me now, and at 47, that I'm not 
thinking of?

Is there a long duration Haste, for example?  I got augmentation lasting 
up to 35 minutes a time or two, but the boost wasn't enough to bother 
with and the duration was half spent by the time I started killing in 
many cases.

SOE should stick now, a long duration SOW would be welcome, plus the lev 
without having to also find a DMF.

Brells is long duration too yes?
