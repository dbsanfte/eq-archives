Its wenglaks?  Hmm, he's also a quest out of Skyshrine, bet he's on
COV faction.  Maybe not, but now I'll have to see if I can find
him.  Here's the thing, though, I haven't found an annotated map
of Kael yet, just one that shows the layout without noting who
or what is where at all.  Not even a dotted line to show the "safe route"
thru, had to learn that following people who knew the way.
