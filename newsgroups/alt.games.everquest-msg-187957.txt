A couple of things.

First, I agree completely with what seems to be the thinking behind your
posts.  But, the example given is an extreme example.  The extreme
example as the case may be.

Most classes cant get an AA in 20 mins, and even the classes that can,
can only do it in a handful of spots.  The spell you must have to get an
AA every 20 mins as a Necro comes from a Rune and is level 65.  Most 65
necs dont have it.

While PoP did speed up xp gain considerably, it also added 5 levels of
regular xp and lots of AA abilities.  I think its great that average
time to gain an AA went down by about half for most.

Now, charm in PoP is way overpowered.  But its typical Verant.  They
went dramatically away from the Luclin mob model with PoP, making them
have less HP, but do much more damage.  The charm spells they included
for Necros, Mages, Druids and especially Enchanters allow players to
take hold of this shift in the mechanics of EQ and exploit the fuck out
of it.

On test right now they have made the charm spells for Mages, Necros and
Enchanters resist much more often.  I dont think this is a good solution
though, as it really doesnt do much at all to curtail Enchanters
charming, since they have Tash and the TD line of AAs.  It does make
Mage and Necro charming more dangerous, but these two spells are already
extremely limited in their utility compared to the Chanter one.

For a while on test charm came with a 1% perma slow effect on it.  That,
to me, is a better solution.  But really, these spells flat out shouldnt
be in the game.
