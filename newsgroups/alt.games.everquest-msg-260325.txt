Personally, I like having a lot of different classes from which to 
choose, as long as they all have some justification or at least their own 
identities. 

I agree that beastlords (hey, let's take a shaman and give them more uber 
spells, a nastier pet and kick their DPS up a notch or 12) were a 
mistake. Maybe berzerkers too, but I don't know that much about them. 
They both just seem to have been added for the sake of adding classes.
