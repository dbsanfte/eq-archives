For 9-11 do the skelly hut by the east end of the river in tox. They dont
assist or run away, and theres 4 spawns on about a 5 minute timer. They dont
drop much loot, but xp is great.
12-14 is good in wc hunting wisps.

I hear crushbone has a very big xp modifier, so it may be worth checking out
too.
