Get Luclin.  Go to Luclin.  Bind at the bank in the Bazaar.  Getting to a
bank is then a simple matter of gating.  The go to the Nexus and take the
free port back to Tox.  On average, under 15 minutes round trip from Warrens
to bank and back to Warrens.

If you don't have Luclin and don't want to get it, consider binding in the
firepot room in TD.  Getting to a bank is then gate to firepot room and
clicking the firepot for Neriak, which takes you to Neriak Commons.  When
done banking, gate back to firepot room, and click the Erudin firepot, which
takes you near the dock.

Often you'll find that you can bank with a given city's bankers before you
can trade with their merchants.  I used to go to Neriak, buy a backpack full
of food and a backpack full of drink, and put them in the bank in Neriak,
for use when traveling in lands where I could bank but not buy.
