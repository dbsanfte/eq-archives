Dark,

Lets take the scenario you stated, the pimp and the hooker.

What you are trying to compare this to, is that I am a client that goes to a
pimp so that I can spend time with his hooker. If anyone mentions that sex
is being exchanged for money, then they are guilty.  But if sex and money
are not mention, just implied, then they have not broken any law and
therefore can not be prosecuted.  This is called circumstantial evidence,
for no proof exists that the event broke the law.

i.e.
"How much for the date"
"500"
"What does it include"
"Just a date, nothing else"

You pay her 500.  Later on, after dinner you go back to your house and have
sex.  No law has been broken.

If Verant were to look at my account and saw that I have some high level
equipment, knew that I was trying to buy the exact same item but never
caught me in the act, then there is nothing they can do but warn me since
they have no evidence that I broke the EULA.  SO when I say I will pay for
someone to help me, I have not broken the EULA.  When I say that I will
trade items in EQ for other items in EQ, I have not broken the EULA.  I have
not said I will pay someone for these items.  I have not auctioned these
items.  I am asking that someone help me acquire these items.

In law, wording is everything, regardless what the true intent is.  To make
this against the EULA would be impossible because they would have to place
value into the economy on items all items.

Cobalt BP = 10kpp
Bronze Spear = 1pp
Therefore cobalt bp = 10,000 Spears

Then amend the EULA to include the monitoring of values during trade, kind
of like the IRS.  If something is fishy, investigate.

If you want to compare this to something, compare it to receiving stolen
goods.  That is at least a better analogy.
