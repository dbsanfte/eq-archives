My wife bought Luclin yesterday at Circuit City. The price marked
on the box was $29.99, but it was on sale for (I think) $12.

Certainly nothing illegal about software being marked down
after initial release. Happens all the time. I imagine it 
means that the retailer is overstocked and wants to move it 
out of inventory. Maybe word of the bugs and steep hardware 
requirements got out and slowed sales.
