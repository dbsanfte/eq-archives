I'm just wondering, for some reason does it take longer to raise
faction among guards than with merchants?  

I have a newbie DE necro that I hadn't played for quite a while, and I
thought I would try to raise her faction with the FP merchants/guards
by doing the "note to Rebby" rat whiskers quest (with the help of
another character who got the rat whiskers).  

Before doing the quest, I conned the WFP entrance guards as well as
the gnome merchant in the WFP newbie area (Ping Fuzzlecutter) and the
ogre merchant at the entrance to WFP (Boomba the Big) and was dubious
to all of them.  After handing in three stacks of rat whiskers to the
DE lady in the EFP sewers, I am now amiable to Boomba and Ping, but am
still dubious to the guards, so that's why I'm wondering if it
normally take more work to raise faction with guards.

Thanks in advance,
