You don't get it. Dearic IS the best of the best as far as tanks in
our former guild, Arbiters. Only the best equipped, most experienced
of each class can do what is needed and its not every class its only
certain ones. You can't just level up another warrior, you also have
to go farm him UberNodropItem 246, and UberNoDropItem 761C. 
Otherwise the trial will fail and you just wasted everyones time. 

Given the potential for wasted time and the 30 minute retry and the
chance of failure for a Sub-optimally equipped char to succeed
inevitably the same few people, the ones who like Dearic have the best
of the best in terms of equipment and experience, get tells over and
over, come help me get thru X trial. It wears on them. And there is no
substitute, not in any realistic length of time. Who wants to wait
another 8 months while you get uberitems for a secondary tank so he
can match Dearic? And doing so only doubles the number of people who
can help.  So what we have here is a forcefield that allows certain
classes to get thru if being carried by the best of the best and a few
classes that can conceivably get thru assuming they have the best
equipment and the best training and lots of time.

Then again your not listening. Doing this requires the top .5%
equipment in the game.  Getting that equipment is very time consuming.
Almost all large guilds select one or two Prime individuals for each
class as their class leads. They get a much better shot at "the good
stuff", the mouth watering uber items it takes a whole guild camp to
get. So out of each guild there will only be 1, maybe 2, people with
the equipment to get thru.  So you suggest asking friends outside the
guild, yet those friends are undoubtedly going thru the exact same
problems in their own guild, being asked repeatedly for help to get
thru the trials. There comes a breaking point when it ceases to be
fun, goes beyond doing friends favors and becomes work, a drain on
your time you regret. With such exacting standards required in all but
the most uber guild you will find those who can being put upon by
those who need help.

Yes but those extra tanks and stuff won't help on the trials. So
Dearic helps farmer john the Ranger get thru. Can the Ranger take over
for Dearic as lead tank? Nope. So Dearic gets Chubbo the warrior thru
the trials, can Chubbo substitute for Dearic? Nope he hasn't spent 8
months getting the best no drop gear in the game. His damage output or
damage mitigation isn't enough to meet the strict requirements.

Then what you will find is the people who are your friends will be
unable to hunt with you unless you spend a significant amount of time
getting them thru the trials. For 6 people sure no problem. Now what
about the semi large family guild that likes to play together? Then
Dearic or you have to get 60 people through. Again no one but the best
equipped can do it.

Levels alone will not make the difference, equipment that takes months
and countless large scale camps to get will.

it's not great in theory is the problem because it assumes perfect
substitution, Warrior A is just as good as Warrior B. That is flat out
wrong. Warrior B can get as good as Warrior A if he spends lots of
time getting his guild to help him kill dragons and shit so he can
have a chance at completing uber armor set 1 and getting superdooper
weapon 3. otherwise he simply isn't enough of a Warrior to do the job.
