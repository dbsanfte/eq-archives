Also of note is that when the Hell Levels were "smoothed out", they did not
adjust the death penalties.  They stated that they felt that if they mucked
with it, it would introduce exploits where getting rezed would grant
experience above what was lost.   So you still lose more or less exeperience
based on whether the level used to be a hell level or not.   Dying in 46 is
still much worse than 45, and dying in 45 is much less of a penalty than
dying in 44.
