I'd be more willing to.. but you are still suggesting less than a break even deal
for me.  Peridot plus mana returned would be break even, except for my time.  Lets
say I'm not actively doing anything, sitting around LFG or something like that...
well then peridot plus mana would mean I wasnt out anything and wasn't at risk of
getting a group but showing up OOM.  Lets say, though, that I"m soloing (something
I do quite often) then you are still asking me to take however long it takes for
you to restore my mana... better than medding it back to be sure.  Lets say I'm in
an active group.  Now, no, I really don't want to risk being LOM at any point, I'm
continuously busy.  I'll take time to throw a rez on you when I can, even clicky
Cheal you after... but not spend any significant mana.

Look at the people casting KEI; thats 100pp per person fair market value.  Cost to
cast, 900 mana.  Compare to single target Aego at 750 mana, or group Aego (which is
often needed even for a single target) 2000 mana... and wonder why the cleric buff
is generally assumed to be available for the asking but the chanter buff is a good
value at 100pp?
