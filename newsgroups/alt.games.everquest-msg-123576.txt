I guess it varies from server to server. Last Rage I attended, another
guild started porting in like crazy until they saw that a raid force was
there waiting for a few stragglers. (pull not started yet) They wished
good luck and left. Had they not, I'd still call them assholes. And no,
we don't have a list for Rage or anything else.
