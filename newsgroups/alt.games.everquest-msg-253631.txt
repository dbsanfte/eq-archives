I have met one on FV of any decent level and play ability. About the
same ratio for warriors. Though I think the number of warriors I have
met is due to most of them being snapped up by raiding guilds.
'Zerkers though... Just not many of them at all. The one I know of,
our guild leader wants him. He has exceptional DPS, and Snare. He can
tank as well as any non plate class, but other than DPS, Stuns, and
Snares, there isn't much to them that any group would want. (Our guild
wants him because we lack DPS in a big way and only a single SK for
snares.) In a raid the only thing that he brings to the table that
other classes don't do in spades is a Combat buff called War Cry that
increases Attack and puts a haste on the group. (This is a nice buff,
making him and every other melee in the group get even better DPS. So
put him and the main tanks in the same group and the tank should hold
agro better and do more damage. Don't know about stacking though.) In
a group, if you don't already have a Pally for stuns and Ranger, SK,
or Druid for snares then a 'Zerker can be a big adition. They do have
some agro reducing abilities, so they can reduce agro like rogues can.
This means they can usually go whole hog on the DPS without getting
the attention of the Mob. This should mean that they can do better
effective DPS than other non plate DPS classes, unless you have an
exceptional tank that can keep agro like nobodys business.

Anyway, a class that can fill in the gaps that you might have in a
group, but other than that not much of a big deal. Though I can see
interesting group ideas with a group of all melees...
