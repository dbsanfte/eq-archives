All it takes is patience and a naive market (multiple accounts help).
As an example, the recent price manipulation of Blue Diamonds on
Tunare server observed by my bazaar mule, who's till trying to sell
his BDs :(

[step 1]
several sellers relentlessly drove the price down (each selling only
one or two BDs at a time) until the herd followed,
[step 2]

two new sellers appeared, part time only, each selling 10+ BDs at the

low end of the new price range, the herd forged on ahead

[step 3]
an unidentified buyer (or buyers) kept an eye on the market, snapping
up all of the BDs that were priced lower than the "volume discounters"
[step 4]
manipulators disappear from the market for a couple days, prices drift
up slightly and the supply dries up (he/they were probably still buying
up lower priced BDs)
[step 5]
a new seller appears with 60 BDs priced 300pp higher than the "volume
discounters" were selling at (and so 300 to 500 higher than most were
bought for, even higher margin on some of them)

Not huge profits, I estimate 15k to 25k net, but I'm sure the folks
behind it were pleased.  Also, I wouldn't be surprised if more than
60 BDs were purchased, and the 60 sold were just the extras not
used for tradeskilling, which would make the effective profit much
higher.  That is, they got their tradeskill ingredients at a discount
(discount = profit if you're buying regardless), and then sold the
extras for additional profit.

Ah, the unfetterred free market, ain't it a wonderful thing?

Kaev <--- who just wants somebody to buy his BDs, dammit
