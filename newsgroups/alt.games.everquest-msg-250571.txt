I posted this in alt.games.coh and got some response, I thought I'd post it
here to see if there are any here that are not in the newsgroup yet.

   Since there are so many of us from a.g.e. on the Protector server in
City of Heroes, I thought it might be worth while to start a Super Group
(guild).  I'm the only one that volunteered to start it, so start it I will
if I get enough people to say they are into the whole thing.  So far I've
gotten about 5 people who say they will, but I am not sure that this is
enough to make it feasible.  I was thinking that at least 10-12 would be a
better start, if we have that many interested parties.  

    The name of the SG will be Age of Heroes.  We will allow non-usenet
folks in if they are vouched for by agers/agcers.  So, is there any
interest in this?
