I use assist, but since the mob we're fighting likes to jump aggro once 
in awhile, I still have to move around, and using the mouse is how I 
move around.  Click, turn, .... "attack off".  "Dammit!  Click 'done'.  
I said click 'DONE' you damn mouse!  Argh.  Now right click, turn, 
assist tank, ... dammit, he moved just as I hit 'backstab' and all I got 
was an extra pierce!"

Yes, clearing corpses is very nice.  Personally, I like alpha loot.  
Keeps the place nice and clean, those that don't want to loot aren't 
constantly being asked "are you getting enough?", and it keeps the loot 
whores honest.
