It was on the PvP servers for one day, then it got pulled off again due to complaints
I suspect.

See an earlier post I made about this subject.  As a non-NPC player, it made playing
the game pretty miserable.  If you are level 20+, then it wouldn't be a problem, but 15
or below?... watch out.   You'll get swarmed by a bunch of grief players at your bind point.

If they put the M option back on the PvP servers in the form it was, there will be no
new players on the PvP servers.  It makes advancing through levels too difficult.  This
will result in a gradual decline in PC's on these servers to the point where it's mostly only
monsters fighting other monsters.   The teams will be Giant Scarabs vs. Giant Scorpians :P
