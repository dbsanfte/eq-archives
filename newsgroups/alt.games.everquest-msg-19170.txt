I tend to play one game exclusively until I've pretty much run it into the
ground and then switch to another.  Right now the monkey on my back is, of
course, Evercrack, the best friend of socially retarded
glasses-with-tape-wearing folks like myself.  I only wish that was a joke,
but pretty women make me sweat and stammer and I swear I really do have tape
on my glasses.  Oh dear -- did I just admit that?

Anyway, my other faves are:  Diablo II  (STILL waiting for the damn
expansion), Civilization II, Half-Life (am I the only one who still likes
plain vanilla HL?), Homeworld, and Torment.  I've got about 30 other games
but those are the ones that get the most play.
