your first hail instead of requiring two hails for a response.

*** Tradeskills ***
----------------------------------
- Added a minimum chance to gain a skill up on many of the Dragons of 
Norrath cultural tradeskill recipes and many of the Omens of War 
augmentation recipes.  This will make it easier to gain an increase in skill 
when doing these recipes in most cases where the character has a high skill.

You will need to use the Velium Smithy Hammer in order to break down these

*** NPCs ***

nice new potions as well as some of the ingredients that alchemists will 
need to make those potions.
- The Taskmistress Krisz encounter can now be triggered.  Speak to the NPCs 
in Riwwi for more information.
- Several NPCs in the Abysmal Sea are now more willing to chat.  They no 
longer require proof of dedication to their cause.
- New merchants have moved into Lavastorm.
- Some of the Ferans in Riftseekers will drop Softened Feran Hides more 
often now.
- Some of the Ferans in Riftseekers will drop Quality Feran Hides more often 
now.


*** Veteran rewards ***
----------------------------------
- The Veteran Reward buffs are now immune to being dispelled.
- The Veteran Reward buffs will no longer freeze their timers in the guild 
hall.


*** Optimizations ***
----------------------------------
- File caching has been enabled which should yield performance improvements, 
especially on lower end systems when dealing with the UI (opening/closing 
windows, loading a UI, ...).


*** Exodus and Related Issues ***
----------------------------------
- The exodus bug where a player could possibly die during the small amount 
of time after the spell is cast but before they actually zone, should now be 
fixed.  We did the best we could trying to reproduce the situations that 
have been described to us and they have been fixed in our test cases. 
Please let us know if you continue to experience an issue like this.
- Spells such as Exodus, have a chance to fail which happens for each person 
that gets hit by the spell.  This means each person has a chance to not get 
ported.  If you fail to get ported, you now receive a message notifying you 
of the failure.
- Teleport bind(AA) will no longer leave the caster behind.  If the spell is 
successfully cast, then everyone will be ported.  Previously the caster had 
a 2% chance to not port.


*** Features Enabled for All ***
----------------------------------
- The raid window is now available to all players.
- The LFGroup windows are now available to all players.
- Line-art mapping is now available for all zones.


*** UI ***
----------------------------------
- The Potion Belt will now remain visible after zoning (if it was visible 
before zoning).
- The advanced display options window has been enhanced substantially. 
Please note that the Advanced Lighting option is for video cards that 
support 1.1 Pixel Shaders and above.  Also note that the advanced lighting 
is still being tested with some of our known player hardware configurations. 
If you experience any issues with it on, please turn it off.  Not all 
hardware combination have been verified to be fully functional.  For those 
that can use it, check out how cool the lighting looks in some of the old 
zones like the commonlands with the NPCs and their spherical light 
influences.  It looks great.
- The help window has been merged with the petition window.


*** Misc ***
----------------------------------
- You will no longer get experience back from a corpse whose rez timer has 
expired when using the Veteran AA Expedient Recovery.
- The level restriction for entering the tutorial has been changed to allow 
level 10 and under.
- Fixed an old issue with particles.  If you had your client running for 10 
or so hours, some particle emitters would start to show huge particles.


*** Chat Channels ***
----------------------------------
- There are now system owned, persistent chat channels and players will auto 
join some of these channels.  Players level 20 and under auto join the 
"NewPlayers" channel, over level 20 auto join "General" and a class specific 
channel, and there are continent based channels as well.  Auto joining 
channels can be disabled under the options window.


*** Pet Commands ***
----------------------------------
- The "/pet follow" command works properly again.
- The "/pet report" command works properly again.
