Around November or so...  Elizabeth Wooley's son, a 21 year old guy,
commited suicide with a gun.  She believes the cause was due to his online
life on Everquest.  She has inquired through Sony her son's activities,
which was turned down.  So she hires a lawyer, who then decides, "Hey,
let's sue them for money and get them to put a big warning sticker on EQ,
saying it is addictive and can lead to social and mental problems."

Thing is... Her son had some of those 'mental' problems to begin with, and
stated further that she believed he had some seizures or fits while playing
the game, which would make you wonder why the hell she didn't try and help
him in first place.

Check one of the other posts, Loonie blames EQ or something like that for
the link to one of the online articles in reference to this.
