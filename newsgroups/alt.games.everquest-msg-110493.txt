I found a nice guild on Bristlebane.  But.... I'm not an officer so I can't
say you can join.  They don't have many events because the guild is too
small.  We do have allies who invite us on events they have.  I'm too low
most of the time to go to any of the things they plan tho.

The way I found my guild was I went to everquestraids.com and looked up the
guilds that were registered there.  I looked at perhaps 20 sites before I
applied (yes, you have to apply to my guild).   You should find a guild that
has its charter posted so you can read it.  Most of the guilds I didn't
bother with didn't have the charter listed.

I've been happy since I decided to join this guild.  They are nice to me and
help me out with stuff when I ask.   I'm still a little lost when it comes
to higher level stuff so I have to ask dumb questions sometimes.  They have
never made me feel unwelcome and most of the time I feel they are my family.
If you don't feel the same way about your guild then some serious research
should be begun.  I took a week sifting through sites, narrowed down to 2
guilds and applied with the one I'm in and waited till I got a response.  If
they hadn't been so quick to get back to me I would have applied with the
other guild.

Good luck
