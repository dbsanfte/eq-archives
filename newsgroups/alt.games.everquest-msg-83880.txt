Well, in your case, the problem is easily attributed to a lack of memory.
256MB is very marginal for EQ now.  I have 768MB, and I do get a slight
pause once in a while, despite their claims of having fixed it, probably
when someone zones in.  I never have the game lockup for a lengthy time
period like yours does.  In all other ways my system is inferior to yours,
PIII-800, GF2 MX400 with 64MB.
