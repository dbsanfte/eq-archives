Sanjian, I think you're being unnecessarily bitter.

If you think your spellbook is useless in almost all situations, you're not
using it to best advantage.  I don't know your level, so I'm going to
address your comment at MY level - 65, pre-elemental.  My usual group is
cleric, paladin, ranger, shaman, enchanter, and necromancer, all 65, all
with primarily HoT gear with the occasional Ornate.  I'm the enchanter, btw.
You know, the guy that makes the ranger look tough and beefy?

Most of my heals come from the Magnight, my group paladin - on the rare
occasions I'm hit, it's usually one of his heals that tops me off, that
Lightsaber of the Gods effect.  He rarely heals himself; that's the cleric's
job.  If our cleric has to Divine Arb (usually to save my butt, when I've
had a string of resists), Mags fires his group heal immediately after -
heals the group and gives him a buttload of aggro.  When it comes to waking
a mob, Mags is awesome; it's rare for me to get hit once as he wakes up a
mezzed mob (even in Takish-Hiz, where they really hate a mezz) and almost
unheard of for them to get through my self-rune.  I've spent whole evenings
in the Tactics pit and never had a mob lay a glove on me.  If he wakes a mob
and it heads for me, it gets stunned and rooted instantly.  Having a quick,
attentive paladin as my MT makes my job as a chanter a lot easier.

Could I do this with an equally-good warrior?  Sure!  It changes my spell
lineup - I lose a buff slot to Trickster's Aug to help the warrior with
aggro, I keep Calming Visage available for myself and the cleric, and I find
a place to put Root so I can root the mob onto the warrior.  It reduces my
flexibility, makes me swap spells instead of having my commonly-used buff
available all the time, and I have to watch it a bit more carefully, but I
can do it.

Oh, and you forgot that Enchanters get the pacify line, too.  But as in all
things, there are limitations; my mana and the cleric's are limited, and the
ranger and druid pacifies don't work indoors.  In our group, the cleric
assists the paladin and pacs when necessary; if there's only two or three,
Mags just brings 'em - because that's what I'm there for, after all.  :)  I
just have to keep him from thinking I'm bored, or he brings six or nine...

What's my point?  Deriding your class is useless.  I know the value of a
properly-played paladin, and a properly-played warrior, and a
properly-played SK.  We tend to have the paladin in our group because a)
he's damn good b) three healers is better than two c) our shaman would
rather be a shaman than a warrior.  When our paladin isn't around, our
shaman becomes a warrior and we keep rocking - different spells, different
techniques, but we charge onward.  It's slower than when Magnight is there,
and hopefully the changes coming will make it easier for me to work with our
warrior - but when we're picking up or lineup for the next LDON or Pit run
or whatever, we'll be looking for Magnight first, still.

Soulfrost,
65 Enchanter
