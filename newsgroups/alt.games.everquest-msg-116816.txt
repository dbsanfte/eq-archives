I have to say, that I have never been in the situation of needing to look
for a group.  Quite often, even when I am not looking for a group, I get
requests to please come group with someone I do not know.  There are
certainly specific areas of buffing that other classes are better at than a
shaman, but we do get a very nicely rounded set of buffs.  To top it off,
some of the areas that are lacking can be compensated for with potions.  I
used to always carry around a few DS potions with me for those situations
where they really come in handy, I have not lately, but that's just because
I have been investing all my spare cash in some tradeskills lately.
