This is going to be nerfed and nerfed bad!

All Tribute masters dead on all servers.

Foraged bookworms from PoK were giving 1200 points! LOL!
Tinkered animated bait got 1000+ points. People were getting
1 million points.

Didn't they go thru the damn items and look at what was easy
to turn in for big points? WTF were they thinking?!

WTF was the the 'beta' for?
