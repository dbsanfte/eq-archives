I got no problems with them charging for new content, and I like that
this expansion is a little less than the others, and available for
download.

What I despise, is that they work on and charge for new content before
fixing the stuff we have already paid for.  There are broken quests,
pathing issues and other assorted fuck the customer bugs that havent
been addressed.
