In another thread someone suggested that mobs seem to have more
HP and hit harder if your group has more AA points.  I don't know
that its true, and if it is I see some big flaws, as many AA
abilities aren't really worth a hill of beans to a group (MGB for
example) but cost quite a load of points, while other relatively
cheap ones (run 3) are worth well out of proportion to their
cost.  Still, I don't see anything in theory that would prevent
them from using your total experience, both regular and AA, or
adding in another factor to the equation based on your AA totals,
to determine difficulty, and then to scale experience to that
degree of difficulty (hopefully loot too, but clearly not mission
points, which we haven't seen scaling based on AA)
