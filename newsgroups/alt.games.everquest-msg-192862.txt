Dude, shut the fuck up unless you're TRYING to look like a moron. I
wasn't criticizing you, jackass. I am now, but not for the spamblock.
I'm criticizing you for being an idiot.

No, I don't have a job at the moment. Neither do a rather large
percentage of Americans. In case you haven't heard, there's a huge
recession going on. I've been filling out applications, sending out
resumes, and bugging temp agencies since January to no avail. Rent's
gonna come due, and savings are exhausted. (Thankfully, I'm not the
one footing my EQ bill or ISP charges. One small wonder.) It's not
that I'm not trying, nor is it that I can't do anything. Everywhere I
have the education and/or experience to work is either fully staffed
or laying off. I've even tried fast food places (Who tell me I'm OVER
qualified. What ridiculous bullshit is that? Won't give me a job
because I'm TOO good at it. Fuckheads...). I'm not even being picky
anymore - pickiness wore out after the first month. I sorely
underestimated how bad the job market was when I moved to CA.

So, no, I don't have a job. Care to take another irrelevant and
tasteless jab?
