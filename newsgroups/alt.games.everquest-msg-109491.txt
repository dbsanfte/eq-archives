Neither of you has quoted a definition.  As far as I can see, and
certainly taking Darwin as a source, "survival of the fittest" is
redundant and very nearly devoid of meaning since "fitness" is
defined in terms that ultimately equate to survival.

/nitpick
If Hitler had waited Stalin would likely have attacked the following
year.  The Soviet forces, which included roughly 50% of all the heavy
armor in the world at the time and featured what was the best tank
in the world at that time (the T-34), were rather obviously deployed
for offensive operations.  The Germans captured/destroyed much more
armor than they themselves possessed in the opening weeks of the war
due to the grotesque unpreparedness of the Soviet forces (and Hitler
_envied_ Stalin his purge of the Red Army officer corps!).  If the
Soviets had been on the attack they might have actually gotten some
use out of all those tanks and artillery.

As it was Germany simply did not have the men and materiel to take on
such a huge and resilient foe while still having to devote some
attention to other theatres (roughly 80% of the German war effort was
focussed on the eastern front from the day Barbarossa started to the
close of the war).  But if they had waited it would likely have been
even worse for them.

"Nature" is not, so far as I can determine, an entity capable of
"appreciation".  In fact I can see no good reason to anthropomorphize
"Nature" at all (outside of a fantasy novel or roleplay environment
anyway).
