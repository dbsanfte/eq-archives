So my guild has finally convinced me its time to start my epic, but I have
come across a rather annoying stumbling block.

Before each battle you must hand in the seal you received from the Husman
raid (well the grimling forest battle anyway), but does it matter which
spirit I go after first ?
No-one seems to be able to give me a straight answer on this =(

The perma-frost battle looks kinda nasty compared to the others, and I would
like to make a few more levels before giving this a pop, so could I get the
other 5 totems first? I would hate to lose my seal as it took a server reset
for me to get it.

Oh and dont leave no-drop items in tradeskill containers and walk away
forcing it to close, lost me a half decent 1hp that way >.<

Thankyou for any help you can offer.
