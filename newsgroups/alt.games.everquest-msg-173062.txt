Having spent zero time in Luclin zones (almost) until recently, I really
hadn't done much research or careful planning for hunting there. My
partner and I went to Katta earlier this week, and more out of boredom
and a desire to grind xp in a new place than anything else, started
hunting guards there. I had started at indifferent faction, but by the
time we were done, dropped to dubious. (Partner is DE Necro and was KOS
to start, so no loss there for her.)

Well, now we've shifted over to the Grey to try that out. Sure enough, I
got my first Shissar Organs last night. I'm told that with two more I
can do the quest for the nice EB item. But it's in Katta. DOH!

Ok. Exactly how fucked am I? Can I fix this faction with anything less
than epic levels of effort? Am I just looking at killing a billion of
something someplace, or is there a turnin quest of some sort?

Alternately, is indifferent faction good enough to do this quest? Could
I do the old "open trade window, partner invis me, hit Give" trick and
get the item?
