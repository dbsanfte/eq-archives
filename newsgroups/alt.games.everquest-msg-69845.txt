I've really had no problems with SoL with my TBird 900 and GF2 MX
(32MB) card - except zoning was painful.  Yesterday I added another
256MB for a total of 768.  Zone times went from around 1.5 minutes to
20 - 30 seconds.  

I'm sure I had a point here... oh yeah - memory seems to be the key
factor in playability now.  :-)
