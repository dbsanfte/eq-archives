I installed some Microsoft security patches, and found that EverQuest 
would not run, it crashed at the point where the character select screen 
would normally be displayed.  I uninstalled Microsoft patch Q328310 and 
was able to run EQ again.

I haven't been able to research this at all yet, but wanted to get the 
word out and ask, does anyone have any more information on this?  Has 
anyone else had this problem?

Guess I should know better than to install MS patches on Friday the 13th.
