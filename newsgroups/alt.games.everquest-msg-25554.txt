Armor becomes less important as you raise your level.  My cleric started his
career mixing and matching patchwork/leather/banded until I had enuf money
to buy better...  Chain/plate.  I was lucky to have a friend starting a new
mage so I inherited a full suit of bronze from his warrior.

Look for gear that gives you a +Wis stat.  As I said...  AC becomes less
important as you progress as you'll find yourself less involved in melee.

As for weapon skills...  The same applies.  As you get higher in level you
will find yourself LESS often involved in melee and actually playing th role
of "THE HEALER".  This can be very rewarding, but also can be very boring at
times.

1HB is probably what you will end up using if any at all so that you can
carry/hold wisdom items that will give you more mana.
