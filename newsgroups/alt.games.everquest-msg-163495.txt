Hmmm.  I had a couple bad streaks while encumbered (1 for 20 Fletching
arrows I was over 20 past trivial, don't recall the specifics of the
Smithing streak), and then encountered several claims that being
encumbered was bad for success.  Not exactly scientific, but I've
avoided encumbrance while tradeskilling ever since.  Wouldn't be the
first time I was bitten by a random conjunction of coincidence with
a random bit of hearsay.
