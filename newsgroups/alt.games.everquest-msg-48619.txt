Getting from the first to 2nd floor can be a pain in the ass.  We were there
for 1.5 hours and FINALLY got a key (2 groups, the other had a key from
before).

Second floor, ANOTHER 1.5 hours to get a key (again, 2nd group had a key).
Yeah, we could have gotten up much quicker if the key holder changed groups
after moving us, but we wanted to do it right.

Besides, being upper 20s, lower 30s for the most part, even the first floor
gave us xp.  And, of course, the more keys, the better.

Once we got to the 3rd floor the critter that drops it (angry cook, or
something like that) was up immediately, so we took him out.  Some of us
have been up to the 5th floor in the past with our mains and knew that we'd
just be asking for trouble going much higher, so we just camped the exit
mirror on 3rd.  I think we got about 8 keys in 1.5 hours. :p  Considering
the first couple floors it was VERY odd saying "does anyone NOT have a key
to 4th yet?"
