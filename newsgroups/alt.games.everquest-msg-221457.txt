Well, I just did 2 straight LDoN adventures and the only healer we had
was a shammy, and I wouldnt have changed her for the world. (was lvl
65)

I also took an alt down an LDoN as shammy and I was healer.. We
succeded, clerics are born to heal / stun, shammys are
healers/dots/slow, druids sport/buff/heal.. while maybe healing isnt
their soul purpose, and maybe less mana efficent and have a less
efficient heal per lvl.. they can still make excellent healers.

Ive also been where druid was main healer..

Its too much ego....
