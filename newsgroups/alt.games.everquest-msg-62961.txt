OK, I'm confused...you are approximately the 10th person who has made
this point.  Are you all using WebTV to access EQAtlas?  I access
EQAtlas from a computer that has a hard disk.  If I need a map of,
say, SolB, I go get the map of SolB, and *save* it on my hard disk, or
print it so I can use it while in EQ.  Next week, when I need a map of
SolB, I look at the one I got last week.

I realize that 25 years of programming have made me somewhat adept at
using computers, and I can often do things that "ordinary" users
cannot...but I didn't realize that saving a file was one of my elite
computer skills!  Time to update my resume! :-)
