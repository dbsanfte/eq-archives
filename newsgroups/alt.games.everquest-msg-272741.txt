Well, before the big patch I was soloing the ^^stags in Antonica forest, 
however I find those to be deadly since the patch.

You could try the scarecrow fields near the steppes stattion. There are lots 
of lvl 17,18 and 19 bears, wolves etc near the fields. You may also find a 
pickup group looking to do the crows.
