This thread is having two effects on me.  One, I am feeling gladder than
ever that I decided to not seriously pursue tradeskills with Teapray. 
Lentea, should she ever get high enough, will learn Alchemy, but that's
the only tradeskill I really want to get into.

But on the other hand, I'm wondering if I might not turn a tidy profit
by getting my smithing up in the 50s, and then start vending metal bits
in the bazaar.  I can always grow new wrists... I need 175K now! (for
the shroud of veeshan that Kaev saw in the bazaar the other day).
