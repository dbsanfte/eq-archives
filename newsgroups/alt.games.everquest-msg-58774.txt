We wouldn't have the "mule" syndrome if we had some more space to store
stuff.
For instance my bank:
1 10 slot bp filled with Epic quest items (9, one slot filled with a +int
bracelet for tradeskill stuff)
2 10 slot bp filled with gems for jewelry
3 10 slot medicine bag filled with research components
4 10 slot filled with tradeskill stuff I need later on (pots, files, stack
of griff eggs, stack of metal bits)
5 10 slot deluxe tailoring kit filled with tailoring equipment (mask
patterns, crys silks, normal swatches, Heady kiolas, HQ bear
    skins, Grizzly bear skins)
6 10 slot bp with cha gear, extra int gear and one or two resistance items
7 10 slot bp a couple of velium vials for thurgadin potions, stack of pieces
of velium ore, quest items for coldain shawl quests and one or two slots
filled with sellable stuff (drakkel icegrinder at least in this one)
8 10 slot bp for sellable items. Currently 2 slots free which is the first
time in roughly 15 levels.

On me I have 1 bag filled with back-up food and gems for spells plus 1 bag
with stuff as trak key, GD tooth, sow potion, pet focus items, crystalline
net for snare and one or two things I carry around for when a/my group needs
them (i.e. a few peridots for clerics).

I can cut down on the gems when I start jewelry and if I do some more
tailoring I can remove those stacks, but that would not yield me very much
more room. And when I do some serious work on my quests I'll fill those new
slots in a day or two.

Currently I have 2 mules for sellable and guild items, both with at least 8
normal bp's in the bank until I can make 10 slot ones for them. If the bank
could be somewhat bigger (maybe pay for more room or such?) I would not need
my extra chars to store items I want to sell in EC.
