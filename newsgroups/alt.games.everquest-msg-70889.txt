None of your arguments make any difference.  Here are facts:

1) DX8.1 does not support Win95 (DX8.1 SDK)
2) EQ requires DX8.1 (
3) Verant told no one that 8.1 was required until after SoL was patched in
(http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000407.html note
the date/time of the post)
4) Those who are still using Win95 (for whatever reason) have 4 choices:
 - upgrade to Win98 immediately, spending $100 3 weeks before Christmas
 - cancel their account until they can fit $100 for a game into their budget
 - ask for a refund and not only lose their account but all their characters
 - do nothing until they upgrade to Win98, continuing to give Verant money

The only option that costs VERANT anything is the last one, when it was
VERANT that fucked up by giving NO WARNING to Win95 users.  Should they
reimburse the affected players in SOME way?  When you fuck up you pay the
price, you be a man and take the hit.  You DO NOT tell the wronged party,
"bite me."  Right?   The reimbursal doesn't necessarily have to be
monetary...credit would have worked.  A month free to give folks time to
save up for this surprise expense that Verant dumped in their lap NOT at the
last minute but AFTER the fact.

I can't believe anyone would be of the opinion that Verant didn't fuck
up...and if they admit that Verant fucked up that Verant bears the
responsibility of making it right and not by throwing a hissy fit and
telling their "customers in good standing" to fuck off if they actually want
Verant to take responsibility.
