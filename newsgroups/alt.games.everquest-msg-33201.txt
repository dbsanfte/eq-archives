Off the top of my head I can't think of much in the way of enchanter
clothing quests until you reach 50 or so.  You SHOULD do the "Exotic Drinks"
quest for the Stein of Moggok (you'd better have a 29+ druid handy though,
unless you like running...there's lots of traveling).\

www.allakhazam.com   Click on Quests then type     exotic   in the search
field.
