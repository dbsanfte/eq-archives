Either "/tell %t whatever you want to say" or "/ttell whatever you want
to say" works.   And, no, you can't script dynamic text into a macro.

BTW, "%t" is your current target.   "/ttell".is short for "target tell" and
always sends a /tell to your current target.   All this information can
be found in the manual in your Everquest directory....
