It's not that hard to discover the EQ network if anyone is bored or cares
enough. Determine the hostnames and domain name of the servers
(eqworld-32.989studios.com someone said for Prexus). Run traceroute (tracert
should be on your PC) to those names. Note the divergent paths if any. For
an added bonus run the traceroutes from two separate ISPs network access
points to eleminate your own ISP permutations. Of course if they are doing
NAT (network address translation) behind a firewall or two and use
unroutable RFC1918 address space you won't be able to determine the actual
network topology. But they probably are not.
