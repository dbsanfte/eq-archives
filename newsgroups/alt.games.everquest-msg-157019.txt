Uhh, I hate to break it to you, but Warriors aren't exactly the pinnacle of
melee damage, anyhow.

Furor deals 12.5 DPS on average on the mobs he fights. Depending on the mobs
you fight, you could deal more than that with a rusty two handed sword.

So where does Cleric melee pay off? Mobs with high AC (typically Luclin
mobs) since Cleric melee is essentially a scam and it's mostly proc reliant.

There are lies, damn lies, and statistics.
