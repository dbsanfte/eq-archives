Based on what we've know so far, tailoring was damaged by this ('this'
being the change that made the large tailoring kits have *ten* slots,
instead of eight), not improved.

Dig if you will this picture...

Before the introduction of a cheap, store-bought ten-slot container
with no danger of combining the contents accidentally, the best option
for making maximum use of the bank space was the tailored backpack.

Now the large sewing kits have ten slots, and recent changes to *all*
tradeskill kits that make them not destroy contents on an accidental
combine.

Large sewing kits are far cheaper than tailored backpacks. Hence, no
informed person will buy tailored backpacks for bank use anymore. This
was a large part of the market for tailored backpacks, since day one.

The on-character situation hasn't changed - people will still buy
tailored backpacks for the weight reduction. That part of the equation
is a wash. People won't buy *more* tailored backpacks because of the
change to large sewing kits.

Um, right, whatever. I'm not whining, I'm presenting a logical debate.
