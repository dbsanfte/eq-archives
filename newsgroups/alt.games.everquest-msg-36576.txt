Because it's a break from the reoccuring: names thread, what's new thread,
red -vs- blue thread, why can't I log on ( patch day ) thread, my account
was hacked thread, where do I go at level ## thread, Warren's loot thread,
twinks -vs- non-twinks thread, etc.

Because it's an opportunity to see what changes other people have noticed in
the game that one may not have experienced themselves.

Because it's something he and probably others are intereseted in.
