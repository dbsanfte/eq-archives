HEhe..

He is advertising about a LAN party in the city of Boden (Northern Sweden,
above the arctic circle), And while
i wouldn't condone using usenet as a bulletinboard, it was pretty fun to
read you try at translating it :)

And yes 'bod' mean larder or granary and is the parent word used to name the
city ( i guess they kept stuff in
stock there to survive the winter) . Your translation goes approx. like
this: 'It is not righteous if mail Swedish relay
international usenet news'.

I had a good chuckle at it..

Patrik Henriksson. (Exiled Swede in New Hampshire)

Ps. Morte, while it was a good try to get some people to come to your party
it is genarally frowned upon to
1. post in foreign languages, 2. make any form of advertising in usenet
newsgroups.

Pps. (In swedish language) Morte, medans det var ett bra f�rs�k att f� fler
bes�kare till erat Lan party s�
�r det generellt sett inte popul�rt att: 1. Skriva meddelanden p� andra
spr�k �n engelska. 2. Annonsera i
n�gon form p� Usenet news grupper.
