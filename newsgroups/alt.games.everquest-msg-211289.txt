Fair enough. Depends on your class to a great extent I guess, as there 
are some strategies (rooting, kiting, etc that will allow you to solo 
higher level critters) but toe-toe you almost always lose.

A long time ago this was more true. But nowadays with 
fast-easy-levelling and wandering uberbuffers many newbies are in their 
mid-teens and before they ever die a legitimate death (getting trained 
or attacking your guildmaster doesn't count). I mean whats going to kill 
a 2nd level warrior with a damage shield and 800 hit points in North 
Qeynos? or even a 15th level ranger with 1200 hitpoints and regen in 
Crushbone? He could solo three slavers at once.

I run into more and more newbies all the time who don't know/ don't have 
their class defining skills or spells at 16th level, enchanters without 
cc spells... rangers without snare, wizards that tank, they simply level 
so fast and so easy they don't learn their class at all... until someone 
sits them down and clues them in.

I can too, but we're not newbies. We know how to kite, how to hunt 
outdoors, how to break a camp by zoning, to avoid critters that root, 
charm, nuke, etc etc...

This requires skills and information that a typical 9th level shaman 
simply doesn't have yet, especially if they spent the first 8 levels 
with 1000 hitpoints powerleveling against reds in a single fast spawning 
camp, on some charitable hi-levs generous buffs....

You evidently do completely ignore con *messages*. You just said your 
decision making process is based on the colour of the message not the 
message itself. The messages could probably all be "Ha ha if your 
reading this your wasting your time" and it wouldn't effect in the least 
bit how much use you get out of the conning system, as long as the 
colour coding doesn't change.
