Okay - it's patch time again, what to do? Well, my "other hobby" is making
free porn sites. You could always check out http://asiafirstclass.com if you
like Asian girls. I am in the middle of making another site now with
European girls but it is slow going with my EQ2 playing interfering into
schedule big time so proberly wont have it up till this sunday at best.

For the morally rightous who are disgusted by such thing, hey, I am a
Freeportian, what did you expect?

:-)
