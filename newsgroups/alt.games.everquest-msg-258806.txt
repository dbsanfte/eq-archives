Its easy enough just to change hotkey pages to one that has nothing in 
the turn arrow slots, or to remove track from the hotkey slot thats tied 
to the turn arrow.

I've automated several different skills over my various characters' 
lives, and its a paradigm shift in effectiveness; skills like Forage or 
the old chestnut Sense Heading are sheer drudgery to raise and nearly 
useless until they are quite high level; having them go up without 
having to work at it is vastly better.

My favorite was my bard's sense traps and remove traps skills; turns out 
you don't need to have a trap handy to do this; I had something like 20 
points till quite high level, then when I finally found out I didn't 
have to have a target and tied them to my arrows, they capped out within 
  a level.  Not that they ever became useful, mind you, because the caps 
are abyssimally low,  but it sure was painless.

Probably the best option yet, unless refreshing track maximizes it again.
