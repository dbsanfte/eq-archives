Different strokes for different folks. Some people have played the 1-10 game
a dozen times and it doesn't appeal to them so much as the 40+ game - let
them skip the early parts if they want (but not automatically >8) ....). So
long as it doesn't interfere with the people that DO want to blow up fire
beetles, it's OK by me. In fact, it's better, because they're not taking all
the real lowbie's mobs for very long.
