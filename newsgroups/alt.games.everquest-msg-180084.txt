Having bought the Imbue Peridot spell at level 29 (for completeness
more than anything else) I finally had a request to imbue a stack of
dots at level 53 or 54 (can't remember which).

I would regard the cash-making opportunities as laughable.

This is simply untrue. Clerics can solo a fairly decent range of MOBs,
especially undead but others also. The common strategy is root & nuke:
root the MOB, nuke it, if root breaks re-root, back off, heal self, nuke
again. It's very slow (say 15-20 minutes per MOB) but you *can* exp that
way. For most dark blue MOBs it uses half to whole of the mana pool.

Occasionally you won't have enough mana; in that case, either med up a
little, keeping the MOB rooted, or run away. :-)

You can avoid the getting beaten on by casting Fear, with the usual
risk of adds.
