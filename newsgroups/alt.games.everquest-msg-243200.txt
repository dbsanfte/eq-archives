Welcome to how we had to learn the zones before the Legacy of Ykesha
expansion. :)

Ok exaggerating there, but prior to the mapping function you often had to
know a zone quite well to move around and you were forced to explore
more as you learnt the game and the resources available to it. The map
function is 2D however so for the more 3D zones this requirement to
explore and learn the zone still applies as the maps can be a bit
confusing and so its a useful idea to begin to learn any zone you use a
lot to a more instinctive degree than 'pull out the map'. Online map
sources however generally were used for the equivalent of that though.
However they were use dto a lesser extent as a) not everyone has printer
access and b) not everyone could use EQ in a window as they can now so for
quite a while even online maps were awkward. I didn't play at a time
before such online maps existed so I had it easy in new zones compared to
those who had to go from scratch.

The map function is only available for a limited subset of zones if the
account you are playing on has not got Ykesha activated. The zones it
includes are typically the starting city zones and those which would be
adjacent and include 'newbie' areas.

Even if you do have Ykesha activated the game doesn't supply all the maps
to you. Go to maps.eq-toolbox.com to pick the full set thats available up.

If you don't have Ykesha and dont have the fullmap set available ingame
then go to www.eqatlas.com or a numberof similar sites and load up the
relevant map - then you can alt tab to it or have a print out handy to
navigate by.
