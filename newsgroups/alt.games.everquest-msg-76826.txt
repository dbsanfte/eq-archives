i didnt catch the beginning of this thread, but im guessing youre talking
about Win2k or WinXP (probably WinXP)...

i would get a message all the time that i was out of virtual memory.. i
would IGNORE it....

i know you're supposed to have like 1.5X or 2X your physical memory as a
swap file, but that would take up more disk space than i have!

i have 768 megs ram, and WinXP always makes some 1.5 GIG swap file
automatically. i would NEVER need something so damn big! (my C drive is 6
gigs. WinXP takes up 1.5 gig, EQ takes up 2.0 gig, \Program Files takes up
1.5 gig, etc) people with 128 megs ram are fine with their 256 meg swap
file, so why would I, with more ram, need more swap space?

anyway, i set the swap file to something around 16 to 64 megs... while
working on my puter and running many apps, Windows would complain that it
has ran out of virtual memory or something. i would look at my System Tray
(where i have MemTurbo running), and i would notice over 500 megs of free
physical ram... im thinking "wtf? why doesnt it just use the physical memory
and stop trying to swap?" ...

im in Win98SE now, enjoying the 768 Megs ram better than i did in
Win2k/WinXP... i've heard a dozen times that Win9x cant handle > 512 megs
ram - but this has been the most stable Win9x experience i've had in years.
file cache is set to min/max 64 megs, swap file is always at 0 byte use (16
meg permanent min/max) w/ conservative use set to 1, and an average of 600+
megs free ram at all times for games.
