Actually I'm more pissed about PoP, I've willingly registered LoY for all
free accounts because I believe I will get some use from it. PoP, on the
other hand I have no real use for, except one...Spells, the spells available
in PoP (vendor, not dropped) are No Drop and so I am unable to get them at
all but the rest of the expansion holds no use to me at all. I don't have an
active guild, I rarely (like almost never) group now, I have a Druid to port
me where I want to go...I see no real value to the expansion except the
couple of extra spells I miss out on.
OK, Pissed Off is a bit strong, mildly annoyed is closer to it. It's not
like someone has taken those spells from me and I seem to get by without
them just fine....Just knowing they are there and can't be bought...bah.

The best (read most pointless) complaint about LoY I heard so far is why
they have introduced the Charm Slot to your inventory already, sorry? Is it
in your way or something.
