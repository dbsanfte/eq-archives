Work on Magic first, Cold and Fire next, then poison and disease.  Poison
and disease are the hardest to raise in my opinion since most gear has the
MR, FR and/or CR bonuses.  As a warrior I already have a high MR.  But with
gear my unbuffed MR is 133, FR 102, CR is 112, PR 59, DR 67.  And I have
these without having to sacrifice AC or stats.  For pure casters the no AC
earrings and rings that have resists are good choices.  For a melee it is my
opinion that the AC and stats will do more to protect you than having just
resist items.
