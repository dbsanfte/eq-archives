I have been playing EverQuest since late December '02 and have two
characters. A LVL 26 Froglok Shammy and a level 7 SK(just created). I was
hoping someone could give me some advice.

Firstly, the hardest thing for me in the game is making money. My main char
that I use most often is my shammy, and spells not to mention armour and
weapons cost money. The entire time I have been playing EQ, I find it really
difficult to make a decent amount of money to buy anything with. I take all
the money I can get from corpses and sell stuff that I dont need, but that
is not alot. I was wondering, how can I make some good plat?? If someone
could help, it would be most appreciated.
