I've looked into joining a guild now and again. Usually, they just
don't fit what I'm looking for, or I no longer have the kind of time to
devote that many guilds seem to request. Like you, I only get to play
for a few hours a week. Playing solo has it's own limitations. All of
my EQ playing friends have stopped playing for one reason or another
(bankrupcy, moved on to other games, dead, etc.), most of my wife's EQ
playing friends have either gone on to WoW, EQ2, CoH, etc., or decided
they didn't like MMO's. There's a few who still play, and one we got to
play this past year, but they seem to play less and less. Usual
reasons; scheduling constraints.

Heh, yeah that's the truth. I have a tidy sum built up from selling
festive dolls :D It felt so wrong, and yet, it felt so good...

Nifty. I'm still going to make the Experts armor set. I've also been
trying to convince my wife Crypt of Nadox isn't that scary ;) We could
get some cool no drop gear there comparable to much of the Bazaar
stuff. She won't buy into it, and finding a pickup druid/cleric at the
times we play is difficult at best ;)

Know what would rule? Wizardry 7 and/or 8 redone as an MMO with EQ2
type graphics. Sir-Tech will never realize the boat they missed on
that. I dunno if I'd say greatest, but it is pretty fun. Mostly I was
wondering if others had made such observations or if I was just being a
whiner. Looks like I'm just being a whiner so far, so my apologies <:)
