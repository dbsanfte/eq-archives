I guess 300pp is rather good price for a staff like that, not shure
that i would like to drop my 2H since i'm getting rather good at
it now, on the other hand i could use some nice +int stuff, hard
choice to be made, my 1h slash, blunt pierce skill is way lower
than my 2H blunt so it will take some practice, i guess i could fight
them nasty moss snakes *lol*
