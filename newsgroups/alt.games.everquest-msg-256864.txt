We usually use a ranger with Weaponshield, as it lasts longer.  That 
second tank better be working on getting agro before the discipline wears 
off.  I stand right next to the tank and ranger, and malos and slow 
during the WS, while the tank builds up aggro in order to take it off the 
ranger.  Usually goes 5 seconds after WS, tank engages, 4 or 5 seconds 
after that, shaman slows.  Once slow is called, tank does everything he 
can to take aggro off ranger.  Usually, both the ranger and shaman 
survive.

We try to have one healer of some type, shaman/druid/cleric in each group 
that can deal with healing the group members as needed.  You don't 
generally need group heals to keep the group alive for Xana, although 
they sure would be handy.

Just remember that often there can be lag on hp bars, among other things, 
such that the hp bar looks full, but is not really.
