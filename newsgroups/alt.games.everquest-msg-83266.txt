Damn, EQ is dead...ok everyone, time to move on, it's official...he said so.
I'll be the martyr and stay, I'll even look after your equipment while
you're gone...honest.

The numbers dropped when DAoC came out, no question...numbers, likely
dropped again when Luclin was released and lots of people couldn't run it
(although, saying that if you did not install luclin and just patched to
DX8.1, EQ ran better than ever) but EC still has 120+ in the evenings...DL's
on a saturday night was 100+ last time I looked...I don't think Verant is
about to go to the wall or pull the plug so I don't see any point in this
post....except to troll, maybe.

DAoC has some great ideas but I don't think it captures the imagination like
EQ (read it's not as compelling) in fact the only thing, IMO, they
definitely got right and is a big improvement over EQ is the trade skills.
