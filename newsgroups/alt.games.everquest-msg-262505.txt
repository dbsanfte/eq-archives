Sounds like your initial problems might stem from downstream links.
Lost packets and all. If the data transfer stalls, your system may
look like it locked up.

56K would equate to a base 5.6 K bits per second. If the modem does
data compression you can exceed that. I think FCC regs restrict 56K
modems to 53K in any case.

If the phone line circuit you used (this would be after it leaves your
parent's house) underwent changes (from when you last used it), it is
quite possible to have it unable to handle the higher speed traffic. I
believe a 56K modem has to establish certain channels on the phone
line to get to the higher data rate. If it can't, then it should step
down to a lower rate (in my case, my USR external ratchets down to
33.6). In my case, whether or not I get a 49.2K connect or a 33.6K
connect depends on the time of day and a bit of luck or stubborness.

If the line conditions make the 56K connection rather flaky with
retransmissions and such, the effective rate might be much lower than
the apparent connect speed. I find it unusual that you could connect
at 56K (at all) and then have a similar download time to a 28.8K
connect but that is possible.

Btw, I didn't do the incremental downloads. When I initially tried to
do the OOW download at 49.2K, the patcher indicated that the download
would take 16.5 hours. I decided to go retail. I think you got off
easy. 8-)
