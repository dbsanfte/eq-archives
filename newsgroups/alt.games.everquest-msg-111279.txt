    Damn HT, huh? :-) I remember when Hands was that scary camp at the back
where you had to be good to be there. And the basement was a two-group raid.
Last time I was in the basement it was me, a shaman, and a warrior, and we
gave the Iksar Berserker Club that dropped to the shaman because he needed a
practice weapon for 1HB. Are you able to solo Disco in Seb yet?

    Hence my newfound love of AoE groups. I get to deal a ton of damage, I
get to exercise my judgement in healing a lot more, and the looting frenzies
afterwards are a hoot. And we get to name the dire charmed pets.

    Which is odd, as back in the day I found the best XP we ever got was in
Shrooms doing King. I didn't AoE back then, mind you.

    And as another data point on the "remember when this was so tough" list:
last night Undead Bard was up, so we went and killed Trak for a guild bard.
I'd never gone past the gateway before (aborted Juggs raid), so it was all
new for me. Boy, Juggs sure seem easy now. I was nuking on most of them,
with the odd CE on the main tank. And the players that had killed Trakanon
before were laughing at how easy it was last night compared to when Kunark
was new and Trak was attacked in "waves".
