Few things.

1) The spell sucks (I have it, I've NEVER cast it, at level 59)

2) Fury of Air DOES work indoors.

3) You will not be able to do this solo at 39, however, that's not a big
issue actually.  For the Howling Stones key quest (trust me, you'll want to
do it) you need a fang from Xalgoz, the "boss" of Kaesora.  He's a level 40
sarnak vampire on a 30 minute spawn with placeholders, spawn point behind
the pulpit in the church (consult a map).  A full balanced group of 39-45
should be able to fight their way down to him and kill him (I've done the
Xalgoz run duo'd with a 53 mage at 48, and 2-boxing myself at 56 with 53
warrior).  On the way down to him, you WILL get the strathbone silk.
