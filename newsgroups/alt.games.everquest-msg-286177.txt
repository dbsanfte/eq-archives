I was in beta about a month before they went live.

I got tired of the slide show and opted out.

The experience of graphics and computer speed varies, sometimes
speed of the computer doesn't seem to make a difference as to the
quality of the display.

I'm on one of the unofficial EQ forums, and most of the people there
who went to VG left; however, thats not a large sample of players.

Vanguard said they would be increasing the graphics.

I'm not buying a new computer just to play one game.
