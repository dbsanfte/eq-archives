I agree with you totally.  You have no idea how damned proud I was
have FINALLY saved up the 50pp it took for me to buy a combine
scimitar from the gypsies in North Karana.  The two grif deaths I
suffered before actually getting the sword didn't even bother me at
all.  Every item on my level 50 druid has been earned either through
trade (GEB's), earning enough plat to buy it (Treeweave), or
physically camping it myself (Mammoth Cloak, Goddamned Paw of Opalla).

THAT said, after TWO years of work on my druid, I don't really feel
all the inclined to do it all over again with my Enchanter who isn't
really sweating plat for spells or items.  Granted, he's not uber
twinked out (O-Robe, +5 int dagger, Stein of Moggok), but I don't
really feel all that bad about him not really earning his stuff.
