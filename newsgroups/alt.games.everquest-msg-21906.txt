Name is "Vekis" and is a triggered spawn very close to the statue at the small
river leading to the Lake of Ill Omen zone.  The last version I have reliable
level reports for conned red to a level 52 so... nasty.  I believe he/she is on
Legion of Cabalis faction so if you've hunted a fair bit around FV you might
not be KoS any longer, in any case he/she doesn't seen through invis although
some of the surrounding spiders do.

I cannot remember what event triggers the spawn but I'm fairly sure I was told
it's the death of another NPC.
