From what I've seen, if there are no live people, at the camp, it is open.
The more polite/pleasant players will allow you to re-establish a camp
after a wipe, but that's a courtesy, not a "requirement" of camp etiquette.
If you want to hold the camp, have somebody stay at the camp.

On the other hand, trains happen and a wipeout does not signify an
inability to hold a camp. Which is the main reason why *most* people will
acknowledge a group in CR as holding a camp.

The initial camp "theft" was not petitionable, since Sony do not recognise
camps. The followup abuse, if it was actually abusive, *was* petitionable.
