Why would the DoT overwrite it?

Anyway, similarly, I would have thought taking advantage of the ways 
spells stack was good tactics.  (This no longer works, so I feel safe 
discussing it.)  While fighting Dread Corpses a while back in QH, I 
noticed that the Weaken they proced on me could be overwritten by casting 
Strengthen or Berzerker Strength on myself or my pet.  Hmm, I thought, I 
guess strength buffs are like Cure Disease for Weaken!  How cool!  What a 
nice feature to know about!

But now they've "fixed" it, so I guess I must have been exploiting a bug. 
Oops.  My point is this:  Various spells stack and don't stack, overwrite 
and don't overwrite.  How are we supposed to magically "know" that Verant 
didn't _intend_ for them to behave in that manner?  I think the strategy 
used on Yelinak sounded _perfectly_ reasonable.  The rez effects doohickey 
is a bit shakier, but not much...

It sounds like the only way to be _absolutely_ sure you're not going to 
piss off Verant is to not cast any spells that do anything more 
complicated than damage your target.  A joyous day for Wizards!:)
