I dont care anymore,170 instead of 550 Traders and waiting for hours
on a group since WoW and EQ2 release tells me enough.
And what are they doing to improve the situation? - Releasing another
expansion to spread out players even more.Great ,rofl.
I am still curious about numbers,saw something about around 300k 
EQ2 accounts,would be interesting to know how much of them are former
EQ 1 players,I am sure they wont tell us.  :)
