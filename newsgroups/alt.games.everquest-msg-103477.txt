Actually, given the body of writing left behind by the framers,
particularly Jefferson, it's fairly easy to tell their intent.  It's
very clear to me that they wanted citizens who owned personal weapons,
for whatever reason they chose.  It was also clear that they believed
that this was the only way to prevent a tyranny from forming for
certain.  They intended that we should be able to defend ourselves
from threats, whatever those threats may be.
