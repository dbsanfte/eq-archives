In answer to your real question, I would say that the amount its worth is
relative to the level and class of the person being rezzed.  A "pinch" of
cash to a 10th druid, or a 53rd Mage is very different.  In other words a
standard of fee of 50 or 100 pp just isn't appropriate. 10 pp to the druid
may be 1000 pp to the mage.

Not sure. I'd probably give them away if it was convenient for me to do it
at all. I am an enchanter and never asked for money for breeze, nor will I
when I get the higher spells.
