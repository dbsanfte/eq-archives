I've mentioned this in a number of other threads, but it is worthy of 
its own thread.

Just received my copy of this months PC Zone (February not January!!). 
It contains a full version of Everquest. From what I can see this means 
that you get the new graphics but have none of the expanded areas. It 
say's it gives you 10 days of play, but once in seems to change this to 
14 days of play.

Also strangely it says you are restricted to the PC Zone servers then 
makes all the servers available! i.e I am currently set up on the 
Tribunal server not a PC Zone server.

Anyway it all appears to work fine and gives a good feel for the game. 
I'm going to check it out, if I like it and the UK version is still not 
available by next weekend i'll import the Trilogy.

Anyway hope that is of help.

The other thing is the version on the CD seemed quite new as the 
patching was limited to about 5 minutes on a 56 K connection.
