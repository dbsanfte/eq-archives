More importantly, how long can you tank that mob without getting a
healer to spend mana healing your ass? All the people that crow about
the supremacy of melee always seem to disregard the fact that melee
doesn't do shit without support.

If it did, warriors would be able to solo, but they can't. Wizards
can.

All EQ classes can contribute. What makes a skilled EQ player, is the
ability to rearrange tactics and hunting location to best suit the
group's configuration. Min-Maxers are dorks who end up sitting in the
same camp spot forever, doing the same thing over and over, because
"it's the best way". Bollocks.
