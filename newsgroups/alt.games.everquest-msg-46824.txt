[a lot of information clipped, because simply, you both know what you said]


IMO.  Its seeing rebutles and arguements such as the both of yours that
indicates to me that the terrorists HAVE "won" or at very least succeeded in
one of their SICK goals.

I'm going to go out on a limb, even though both of you have indicated that
you were Americans and say this.

The MOST important thing that America has going for them is MORAL.  You BOTH
have contributed to breaking down this moral simply by aguing.

Please be aware that I am NOT debating/rebuting against anything as far as
FACTS that either of you may have made, I am instead rebuting if you will,
the fact that an arguement between you two and many LIKE yourselves exist in
America now due to the most recent horrific events.

<shrug>  I know I cannot stop you two from arguing what-so-ever, I do know
what it feels like to have a shot taken at my pride (let it be family,
professionalism or otherwise), though, to allow it continue is only breaking
that "mist important thing."

Food for thought.
