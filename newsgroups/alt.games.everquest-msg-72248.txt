Maybe. Sorta. I still don't know *why* they are using it, just
observing the earlier statements about the fact that they were.
Possibly, they think (or thought) that players would somehow find it
helpful to configure things locally by editing the XML file, as
opposed to editing a .INI. I won't comment on the wisdom of this plan,
if that was the thinking.

On the Mac side, XML wouldn't do the trick. If an XML transform could
translate the DirectX calls into OpenGL (which I find unlikely at
best), it would almost certainly do so in a manner too slow to be
playable.
