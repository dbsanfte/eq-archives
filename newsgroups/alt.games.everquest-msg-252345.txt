I am one of the ones that really enjoyed it, along with most of the
people I talked to when playing the E3 trial. I can see how various
gamers (e.g. hardcore RPG players) might dislike it, but I think it
fits a large gap in the market for people who want to play MMORPG's
but don't have the time (or money) to commit to playing the
traditional games. I loved that in the trial I could easily join a
team, play through a fun and balanced story driven mission, then quit
all within 15-30 minutes. 15 minutes doesn't go very far in EQ.
