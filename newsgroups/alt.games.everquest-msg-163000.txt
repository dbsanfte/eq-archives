As a rogue, you may want to upgrade from the FBSS to the SCHW at some
point, since neither one is a bank-breaker. But, since you have the
easiest epic in the game and it gives 40-41% haste, you probably won't
want to invest in an uber haste item.

At least, not for a while. I'm going to have to start saving for a
cowl of mortality or some such soon if I want to upgrade past 15/25 in
both my weapon slots.

I had Moulin's 1hs and 1hb maxed by 42 and have wielded raid-level
off-hand weapons of both sorts. So far, I've been singularly unlucky
in getting an off-hand piercer beyond the Blood Point I wielded at
level 4.
