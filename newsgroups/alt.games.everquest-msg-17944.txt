Anyone else annoyed with:

- the few spells you can memorize? Give us at least twice 
  the current number of spellgems

- the lack of a HP bar for pets for pet classes (no, I don't like /pet report health,
  hitting F1 twice, clicking on pet etc)

- the fact that it lets me hit forage, even when in a fight, using up repop time
  for the button, but saying I can't forage right now? 

- lack of an automapper for those situation in weird mazes (ok don't really need
  that .. it'd just be nice)

- not seeing anything while medding .. give this up, really. I mean hey, how
  POWERFUL newbies are when they can SEE things, whoa! lets you slay a whole
  army of reds, yeah. Drop it. This is just pure nuisance and a funstopper.
