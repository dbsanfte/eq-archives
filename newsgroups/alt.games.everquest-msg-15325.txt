How about that the powergamers are at the end of EQ, and that now is the
time for them to move to something else, since they have "Done it all."

I would think a more realistic approach would be to look at the amount of
time CS has to spend debating to uber guilds what is right or wrong vs the
amount of money that this low percentage brings in? How much is CS being
distracted by this and its effect on good customer service to the entire
player base.

I would gladly get rid of 2,000 players out of a player base of 200,000 if
it means resolving long standing CS issues with another 20,000.

It is all about money, it is what capitalism is all about.
