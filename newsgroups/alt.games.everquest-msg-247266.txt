Well, if they didn't fix the Eye of Zomm problem someone would be
complaining about their ignoring easy problems.

I have had the freezeups too. A couple of times just as my character
appeared on PoK on logon. Other times when the character was turning
to head off somewhere -- funny, it has to be a video lock for I can
still hear the PoK music playing. It is very irritating.

I have not the faintest idea (other than an USWAG that something is
occasionally interacting badly with dx9) why the freezeups. I imagine
the developers and programmers are scratching their heads trying to
figure it out too. Although the problem occurs only every so often
(IME), I think it is very true that an intermittent or seemingly
random problem is the hardest to track down.

If someone can consistently cause the problem, then it will probably
be solved fairly quickly, at least for those circumstances, just like
the Eye of Zomm not opening doors.

Here's hoping they figure out what the heck is happening.
