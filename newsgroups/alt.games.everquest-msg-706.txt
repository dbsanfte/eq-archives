Hi

I've just upgraded my 3D card from a Voodoo2 to a Pci Geforce 2 mx Creative
Blaster.  I have uinstalled all the relevant drivers and downloaded the
latest set for the GF, and am experimenting with using the various
detonators at the moment.  Other games such as Half Life and UT work fine in
OpenGL....

Only thing is now when EQ starts, it does the patch check, then drops to
Win98 with "No 3D device detected" (or similar wording).  Is there any way
to setup the video option outside of the game?
It worked fine with the V2, and after reinstalling it completely (Eq that
is) the same problem occurs.

Many thanks

Gorphunk
