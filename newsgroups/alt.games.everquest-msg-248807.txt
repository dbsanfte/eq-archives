That's true of some powers but not Leadership. That was one of the things
that made it so attractive to this duo team. Hypno just picked up Assault
for his 22nd power and when we're together we're getting a 22.5% boost to
our damage. Leadership is a great set and Breathy will be getting Maneuvers
next.
