  Well, since you're currently using patchwork, I presume you're looking for
something that's cheap/easily obtainable for a lower level druid.  At lower
levels, patchwork is pretty much adequate (I still had some patchwork stuff
when my druid was level 20+), but the small/medium leather you can buy from
merchants at a slightly inflated cost is better.  Also, keep a look out for
split paw hide gear which is often sold cheaply or even given away by people
who hunt Tesch Mal gnolls around Splitpaw (in South Karana).  Also, the mesh
gear dropped off mobs in Guk can be good... decent AC and light.

  Hope that helps a bit.  Without knowing more specifics about what you're
looking for, it's hard to give any better advice. :)
