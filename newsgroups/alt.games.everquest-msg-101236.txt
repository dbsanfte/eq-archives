 You should be able to get a fighting baton fairly easy. Drops in
Dalnirs.

 Also Essence of Dol is a good offhand for a newbie monk that drops at
Chief camp in Droga and usually ends up rotting. A little tougher than
Dalnirs though. 

 Haste... Not sure if a 54 Mage can solo Freny for a Flowing Black Silk
Sash. Maybe the hangmans noose if you do the Forager cycler in TT. I'm
not sure how doable it is without a tracker though.

 It's probably easier to go farm other camps and sell the stuff then buy
the items you want. For example the two weapons mentioned you can
probably find for a few hundred pp each. Haste is going to cost you
more. Varies on server but I think the FBSS goes for 4-5k these days.
