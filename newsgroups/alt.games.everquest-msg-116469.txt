The issue isn't the request, but the manner in which the request is
delivered. "Plz" gets just the opposite effect that "please" does -
it's rude. It says "you're not important enough for me to waste 3 more
keystrokes and spell the word right". "My time is more important that
yours". It's not a matter of me not having the time then, it's a
matter of courtesy. You want a favor, you damn sure better be at least
halfway polite in asking it of me.

It's also an issue of this form or request being more of a demand than
a request. Often "sow plz" is followed up by "hurry!" if you don't
respond immediately. The d00ds tend to think they're entitled to my
buffs, and they need a reality check.
