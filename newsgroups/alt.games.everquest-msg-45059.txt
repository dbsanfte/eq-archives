In addition, remember that soling an enchanter safely is a contradiction
in terms.  You can solo, but its never safe hehe.  Of course that is
what makes it fun, but Dan is spot on, the tricks of the trade needed to
be a good group enchanter are not something you can fake.  If you solo
sometimes make dang sure you group at others or you'll find that you are
less than a help to a group later without those skills.
