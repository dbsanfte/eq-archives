I got a lot of mileage out of Burning Woods once I discovered the
giant fort and the relatively safe area around it.  Now I am moving on
to Skyfire and wonder if there is a similar spot somewhere inside the
zone to pull and fear kite?  I have been using the BW zone area some,
and a few other spots around the edges, but would like to move further
in if there is a nice area to use.  Anyone know a good /loc there?
