'Danger' alert in search for killer
By Steve Bird



DETECTIVES searching for the killer of a property tycoon's son have named a
man they want to question, but warned the public not to approach him.

Daniel Keats, 49, suffered fatal head injuries last month after a brutal
attack at his ï¿½2 million mansion in North London.

Police have now asked for help in finding Tyrone Thomas, 26, described as
black and 5ft 7in tall. He is believed to live rough on the streets, but
known to frequent Stoke Newington, Hackney, St Albans, Watford and
Bedfordshire.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: "We are appealing for information on Tyrone
Thomas, who is wanted for information in connection with this murder. We
believe this man may be dangerous and urge the public not to approach him.
If you see him, call the police immediately."

Dr Victor Keats, who bought his son the property near the family home in
Hampstead three years ago, became concerned when telephone calls went
unanswered on October 22. When he visited the home he discovered that his
son had been battered to death. Police believe the murder happened between
October 19 and October 22.

It is thought that Mr Keats, a fitness fanatic, may have known his killer
because no doors or windows had been forced open before the attack.

Dr Keats, who has a PhD in philosophy, is an expert on chess and Judaism.
He has worked in the department of Hebrew and Jewish studies at University
College London and is a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society. He and his
wife, Marianne, are in their 70s.

A 35-year-old man was arrested shortly after Mr Keats's body was found, but
was released without charge.
