What you probably saw was the advert for the trailer they've stuck on at the
end of the first one. They've re-released "Fellowship of the Ring" with
about 5 minutes footage from "The Two Towers" at the end. A sort of "In our
next thrilling installment..." in the finest Saturday matinee traditions..

Saw it yesterday and it looks like #2 is going to be every bit as good as,
if not even better than, #1. Although they do spoil the surprise in the
trailer for anyone who hasn't read the books...
