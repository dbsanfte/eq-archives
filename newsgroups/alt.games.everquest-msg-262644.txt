Close but only halfway. Along with being overly tied up with Israel
(most of the US's vetos in the UN have to do with Israel, and most of
them were against the vote of almost the entire rest of the world),
its also a concern with how in bed the governments of the oil rich
Arab states are with the US, especially Saudi Arabia.

The US pulls out of arab middle east countries and cuts Isreal loose,
the foreign terrorist problem ends. Period.

Of course, that won't happen. Give up on that much oil?...
