    Aye, I agree. But some folks can't be nailed by conventional means, and
if you're someone that feels that two wrongs can make a right, well, there's
your blueprint. What I mean by "can't be nailed" can best be illustrated by
a story from my server.

    We had a warlord named Mohogany on our server. He was a total moron -
trained and KS'ed without a thought. I once mentioned to my party that I was
going to help him and the level 25s in group began all complaining about him
training and KSing THEM. He played off times a lot, so no GM on to nail him
for his behaviour. He got into the top guild on the server by showing up to
their raids and doing everything and anything they asked of him. They knew
about his reputation, but he was so useful to them they overlooked it and
welcomed him in. There wasn't any point in complaining to his guild, as they
wanted him regardless of what a loser he was (the top guild didn't exactly
have a sterling rep either, and had developed a bunker mentality from all
the accusations, baseless and otherwise, they faced). So if Mohogany and
friends showed up and started acting up, there was only one solution if you
wanted them out: move them.

    Ironically, it wasn't KSing or training or any other anti-social
behaviour that eventually got Mohogany kicked out of the top guild and thus
exiled from the server. His guild was on a points system - attend raids, get
points, want an item, spend points. He went to every raid, so he really
racked up the points. And he spent them on stuff you wouldn't figure he'd
want, like a Cobalt BP when he already had a Kael BP. Well, what he was
doing was spending points on DROPPABLE high-end gear, then selling it in EC
and E-Baying the pp. And when his guild found out he was letting drops go to
people outside the guild in EC, THAT is what ticked them off. :-)

> (And, aside from training being Bad Form

    Very Bad Form. I wouldn't do it myself, but I haven't had anyone harass
me while pulling everything I pull away from me.

    Note the part about "come from a direction they aren't facing". :-)
