Nah . No one believed them when they said smoking did not harm your health
anyway. If you did believe them then the cigarette companies did us a great
service by removing you from the gene pool faster . Even now all those
companies peddling herbs, diet supplements , and other such nonsense are
getting away with quackery to a much greater extent.

On the bright side the punishment for letting lefty and the politically
correct crowd get away with this will be extreme . I am going to laugh my
ass off when the double bacon cheesburger tax goes into effect to discourage
wrongfull eating :)
