Doesn't matter -- when you're asking Verant for a pasword for
an account you own, they use the *original* info on the account
to verify your ownership, specifically to protect against cases
like this (and/or hacked/stolen accounts).

Use the ever-useful Feign Stupidity skill and tell them
you "forgot" the password, don't fill them in on the details
about the "borrowing".
