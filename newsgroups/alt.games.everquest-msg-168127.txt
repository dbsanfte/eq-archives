And that contradicts my post how?
You should play the way you want to.  OTOH, it is the height of
absurdity to insist that <your> idea of "fun" is the best idea
of fun for everybody else.  As long as you aren't griefing or
otherwise messing up somebody else's game I don't much care how
you play.  And I cannot see any reason for you to deny anybody
else the same courtesy.
