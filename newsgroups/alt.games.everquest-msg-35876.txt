>Ummm... Instill doubt goes up fast? Have you actually _played_ a monk?

It goes up rather quickly compared to mend. I'd say one out of every 10-20
attempts. That's every minute to two minutes. Mend, on the other hand, goes up
once every 25 or so attempts. And it doesn't have a 6 second refresh time--it
has a 6 minute refresh time.

Another thing to think about, when was the last time Instill Doubt saved your
ass? Or did you any good at all? I just have a practice key, which includes
instill doubt, FD, and sense heading. Sneak was in there but it maxed fast.

it goes something like:
/do 1 (fd)
/sit off
/do 2 (id)
/do 3 (sense heading)

I use it while auctioning, or while the group is taking a med break.

>I
>would wager that ID is the hardest skill to raise

Heh, I feign death almost every battle, sometimes twice a battle, and it hasn't
gone up in a week or two. 193 skill right now.

Err, not that useful when you can't always rely on it.

Another point, I got my mend to 101 almost solely using guild points (maybe 10
improvements), and it's now around 180. At level 47. This means that it would
only be around 90, give or take, if I hadn't used those guild points.
