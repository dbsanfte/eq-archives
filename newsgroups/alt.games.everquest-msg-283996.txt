I tried it last night/early this morning but, if I recall, used
/stopcast and not /stopcasting.  Then, sitting on the horse, I started
to cast, hit the new button, and it worked fine - but only if I
clicked it in the Actions Bar "Socials" window.  It won't work as a
Hotbutton in it's own right, sadly.  Still, it's a start, and a useful
one at that.  Nice idea, Don  :)
