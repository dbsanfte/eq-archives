You have to turn on the model for male iksar to change the face... next time
you log in, click OPTIONS instead of CONNECT to access the graphics menu.
It'll make a recommendation on how many models you can turn on (usually 15
if you have 256meg memory), Vah Shir is always on, by default, leaving you
with 13 (12 if you want to see horses) to play with.

No... Elves can be blonde, and I think also dark haired and maybe red haired
(just change the hair colour). Bard? Guess you must be Wood Elf or Half
Elf... they can also change hairstyle and colour.

Language is 'Combine' and it's the ancient language spoken by the folks that
built the Wizzie Spires (I think)... I'd guess if your monk knows it, you've
been grouped with someone who accidentally used it in /group-speak... you
got lucky and got a skillpoint in the language, grats :o)
