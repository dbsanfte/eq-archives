Heh. Starting a new MMORPG is always confusing. 

You didn't say what class you were, but the axe weapon type is for
fighters. When you do your class selection, you should've gotten a
weapon appropriate for your class (for example, my mage got a dagger).
If you've misplaced yours, you can probably buy a replacement from the
shop next to the docks.
