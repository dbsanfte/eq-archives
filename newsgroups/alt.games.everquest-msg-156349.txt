We've been fighting the dastardly rygorrs at the fort in Eastern Wastes for
many levels.  This morning we killed a Ry`gorr Minstrel, dark blue at level 51,
who had spawned in the spot adjacent to the blacksmith.  He dropped a bard
item: Lute of Rygorr Singing, lore but not no drop.   We've never seen this guy
before.
I find no record of this mob at any of the regular EQ sites.  Anyone else run
into him?
