Incidentally, it was my guild that lost the roll against Drywit's :)
We don't camp for Ragefire often, as we don't really have the numbers
to keep a small raid force in/near Skyfire at all hours kicking
pebbles when we could be in ToV instead, and there always seems to be
another guild there anyway. We were randomed against Drywit's guild
when it wasn't really possible to determine who got there first after
servers were brought up after a patch, so both guilds were mulling
around. (We will get around to camping it successfully one of these
days, of course)
