Then use that gift card to buy another pack of gum, and so on, until
they give up and refund the rest of the money.

There comes a time when you are costing them more money by (ab)using
their "no cash returns" policy than the amount they'd have to give you
in cash.

If they get pissed off and toss you out of the store after a couple runs
through, get a friend to take the card and do it too.



"And if fifty people a day - can you imagine, fifty people a day! - if
fifty people a day walk in to Best Buy, buy a pack of gum with a gift
card and walk out, why friends, they may think it's a movement."
