OK, I have a Dell Inspiron 8600 nvida 64 MB card, pentium M 1.5 ghz cpu 512
RAM. Cable modem.

I have noticed some strange things : While I have less lag in congested
areas such as bazaar and PoK, and I have much faster loading times then my
Athlon 1.4 desktop also w 64 mb nvidia card and 512 RAM. I have found that I
"bog down" asnd seem to run in slow motion, often in uncrowded zones (Lfay
no where near the LDON , Gfay and great divide). I tried turning down clip
plae etc but still happens, in fact happens at same time as wife on her
laptop (same specs). Doesn't seem to be lag, it seems to be a slow down in
general. Could this be due to the laptops auto adjusting cpu speed to save
on batteries (even tho I am on AC power)?

Thanks in advance
