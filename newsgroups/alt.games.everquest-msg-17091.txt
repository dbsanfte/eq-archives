I don't want to get into specifics and start an unending
off-topic thread discussion, so to keep it short I'll
just say, your naivete is touching.  The SPLC is often
as ignorantly biased and polemical against people on
the other side of the political fence as themselves, as
are the racists whom they fight.  I have seen few nationally-
known groups who paint with as broad a brush as the SPLC.
"Physician, heal thyself".

There are many groups fighting racism I'd give my money
or time to.  The SPLC is most very definitely NOT one of
them -- their primary goals seems to be their own
aggrandizement (and fund-raising), and the spewing
of venom against anyone they see as not liberal enough.
For a group that claims to believe in "tolerance", they're
ironically remarkably intolerant towards anyone they
disagree with politically.  Fighting racism should be
a bi-partisan cause -- the SPLC does it strictly
as a political tool.
