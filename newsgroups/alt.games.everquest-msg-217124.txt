    Good to hear that they've isolated one really buggy thing for fixing.
I'd rather they fix the fundamentals than band-aid fix things.

    SotW also adds AC and a significant DS. The druids have been a bit
bitter ever since clerics got a 15 minute refresh HoT AA - I'm surprised
they didn't take shots at us and not BSTs.

    That monk is in my guild, and Scott Hartsman misunderstood the question.
It was 16 times in a short time frame, not 16 in a row. The monk and
Hartsman got drunk later and clarified the issue. ;-) Apparently failure
rate on FD is on a sliding scale, and depends on what zone you're in and
what mobs are aggro on you. So yes, the failure rate on feign in elemental
planes (for example) is deliberate. (For Martin - Kinma went to Fan Faire,
along with a large number of my guildmates.)

    Oooooh. I second this suggestion. Imagine a BST shouting "KITTENS!" and
unleashing a tiny furry horde on the enemy! It would be sooooo cute! Oh, oh,
or baby bears!

    The two big zones where this seems to happen are PoK and Earth-A. They
should try and figure out if those two zones share any properties.

    Warriors have a WAR-only piercer dropping in Saryrn's tower in Torment,
and they have lowered Piercing caps. I think of it as the Devs tormenting
the players.
