Ok I don't know what all files are needed for the new patch, but I do know 
the UI files were definitely all new, so I've zipped them and put the file 
up in case people would rather grab it. Go to:

www.thalunatik.com/uifiles.zip

All of the new UI files are about 12.5MB when downloaded individually, but 
this zip file is just 4.25MB (don't ask me how that works).

I was going to put the jaggedpine files up as well but I have just 20MB on 
that webspace and there's not enough to store all of the files for it. 
Instead I've put up a zip file with just jaggedpine.s3d, 
jaggedpine._sndbnk.eff, and jaggedpine._sounds.eff. The file totals about 
8.13MB. For jaggedpine you will still need jaggedpine_chr.s3d (2.5MB) and 
jaggedpine_obj.s3d (2.12MB). The jaggedpine file is here:

www.thalunatik.com/jaggedpine.zip

I'm sorry I couldn't fit all the jaggedpine files on there, but since 
they're optional I'm sure people can live without 'em for the moment. The 
UI files are necessary though, so I hope this will help. I'm not sure if 
peoples' problem is that the patch servers are slow or just unreachable. 
If it's the former then maybe my zip files will help out with that. I know 
there are other files here and there that the patcher will need to get, 
but I've included some of the main big ones, the reduced size for the UI 
should help a lot for 56k'ers.

Anyway, happy hunting :)
