Then read about Everquest, You can even do it here, but guess what,
Usenet isn't Just for discussing the subject at hand, oh, and this isn't
a message board, Quote top, reply bottom, and SNIP.

You can Killfile anyone you would like.  But a Newsgroup is for exchange
of ideas, here, in a.g.e the glue that binds us is everquest, over in
the alt.religion, or soc.religion, its religion.  That doesn't mean we
only discuss everquest, it also doesn't mean that we do the hi, props
bit.
