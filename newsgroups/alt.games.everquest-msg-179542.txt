First there was the Star Trek thing.  I was hanging out with Warf, he's a
pretty cool guy for a Klingon.  Then there was shopping in second-hand
stores in New York City.  I really wanted that recliner with a back
upholstered to look like a book (it was pretty cool, I guess you had to be
there).  But the real nightmare is when I dreamed that I accidentally
cross-posted a response to one of End Time Prophets posts.  Was I glad to
wake up from that one!
