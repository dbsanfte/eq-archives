This is absurd. GFay is a two minute run without sow with absolutely
nothing dangerous in between, unless you idiotically get too close to
the crossroad guards.

99% of the people out there assume that if you want a port to gfay, bb
will be just as good, and vice versa. For good reason.

After that complaint, I hope the next time you *walk*. Might make you
more appreciative.
