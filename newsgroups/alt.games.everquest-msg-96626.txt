the drop rate in CT was very varied.  You could hunt where the avatar
popped, in the temple in the 4C area or down in the plank area to get
them.  And to pop a crusader, you could sometimes kill lizzies for hours.
I've had 3 in a row pop for us, and i've gone 7 hours without a pop.

its tedious, but i imagine it might be easier now that its outdoors, as it
was sometimes difficult to find a group willing to fight in the areas where
they crusaders popped *and* be skilled enough not to get killed when
you get aggrod by 3 mobs.
