Back when I was a wee battlecleric, I learned a crazy skill from a druid 
he called the bunny hop.

Get a big slow two hander (after all, we don't have access to one 
handers anyway).

Sit real close to the action (once the MT has the mob's attention 
firmly, of course, since the combination of proximity and sitting is 
pretty nasty)

Watch for med tic.

When the mana goes up, stand up, hit attack, sit back down.

One swing per tic, but if your weapon's delay is up near 50 that won't 
matter, you'd only be getting one swing per tic anyway, more or less.

Meanwhile, you get full meditation benefits as if you'd been sitting the 
entire time.

I had to modify this a bit, but used to use it while fear kiting; Stand, 
run up to the mob, hit it, sit.  With SoW on and mob snared (druid 
partner) it didn't get far enough ahead that I couldn't easily catch it 
and swing before the next med tic.  And I had to move sometime, in order 
to stay in range to reapply the fear as needed.

While my damage output certainly wasn't amazing, it wasn't terrible 
either (sub 44 cleric damage isn't awful), and as far as I was concerned 
it was all free, compared to just sitting and medding; no cost to mana 
regen at all, just to my meat puppet's carpal tunnel potential.

Splendid
