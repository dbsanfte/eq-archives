You seem to equate HTML with Microsoft.  HTML is an international standard
that was started long before Microsoft got its grubby little fingers on it.

Most every modern newsreader can handle HTML, and the amount of overhead that
it introduces in most messages is quite modest (as long as it's not crap
HTML produced by Microsoft Word!)

Adapt to new things, or spend the rest of your life fighting meaningless battles.  
Do you want your tombstone to read "I kept HTML out of Usenet!"?
Such a noble cause.

Personally, I prefer standard ASCII too, because it makes the messages easier to 
read when they are all the same typeface.  But I wouldn't insist on it.
