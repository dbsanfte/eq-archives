At 29 Druid DoTs are:
(29) Immolate                24/ for 10 ticks (plus ac debuff)
(24) Creeping Crud           21/ for 10 ticks (-100 resist!)
(14) Stinging Swarm          14/ for 9 ticks  (-100 resist!)
(1)  Flame Lick               3/ for 8 ticks  (plus ac debuff)
All are stackable for up to  62/ tick

At 29 Shaman DoTs are:
(29) Envenomed Breath        27/ for 7 ticks  (plus 30dd)
(19) Affliction               6/ for 21 ticks (plus 30dd)
(9)  Tainted Breath           8/ for 7 ticks  (plus 10dd)
(5)  Sicken                   2/ for 21 ticks (plus 8dd)
All are stackable for up to  43/ tick

Other Druid advantages:
Root checks for break much less frequently
(and cannot be broken by recast of DoT!)
Snare adds greatly to safety

Other Shaman advantages:
Better armor (chain vs. Leather)
Can slow mob to improve chance of successful casting while under attack

Overall:
At L29 Shaman is adequate, but can have trouble vs. yellow cons.
At L29 Druid is excellent against any mob root will stick to even
half the time (i.e. including yellows and at least some low reds)
due to superior root and huge resist mod on swarm-type DoTs.

Like you I've heard that Shaman DoTs are pretty powerful.  But I got
tired of waiting for my slow connection to show me pages from Lucy and
did not check any of the higher spells (char in question was L29).
But with DoT stacking allowing multiple swarm-type DoTs to land, and
Snare, and those lovely Druid roots, I wonder if Shamans are actually
better than Druids at rotting anymore (if ever they were).
