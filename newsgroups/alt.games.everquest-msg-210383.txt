The other advantage of this method of calculating
haste (as opposed to several other methods that people
have tried from time to time) is that it's a direct
measure of how much more damage you're able to deal
out.  For example, 36% haste means that you will
do 36% more damage on the monster in a given period of time,
and 100% haste means that you'll double your original
damage output.
