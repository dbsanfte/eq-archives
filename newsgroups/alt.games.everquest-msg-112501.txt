Excellent point.  That's why I usually refrain from taking the
bait and starting controversial off-topic side discussions.  Like
you, I'd rather this newsgroup be a place I can come to and
get away from the never-ending battles elsewhere.

When I feel I absolutely have to respond, so that a bogus statement
doesn't remain unchallenged and thus appear valid, I try to do 
it in a way that is calculated to wind down the topic instead
of inflame it and draw in a dozen more combatants.
