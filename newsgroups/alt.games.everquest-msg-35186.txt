You will want to stay on the walls to keep out of agro range. Just follow
someone that has been there befor.
Be ready with a couple stuns and root. Be ready to camp out of raid leader
yells for it.
You WILL lose XP. You have a SMALL chance of getting someing.

If you know what to expect it won't be a surprise or as frustrating.
Have fun.
