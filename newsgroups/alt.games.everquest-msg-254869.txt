I have always had two rules about this... The adventure is over
when:

1) Someone leaves, for whatever reason. Everyone who started the
addy must finish it, it is a group effort and I will not give the
benifit of Free points to anyone.

2) Someone opens a chest, box, barrel etc. In this case, I gate
out instantly. I worked hard for my xp and dont need someone else
risking my xp for some stupid illusion potion or other junk item.


Otherwise I stick with a group. I consider myself a good enough
player that I can usually compensate for inexperianced or
dragging players at least well enough to get through the addy.
