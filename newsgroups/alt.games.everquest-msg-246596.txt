Very impressive, and, yes, I do admire your dedication to science  :)

On a practical front, I started a new Troll character on Tallon, two
days before the change.  The change is certainly very good - at level
12, prior to the change, the troll was killing Beetles and Mountain
Lions in EC, and would have to med up after a couple of kills.  Now, I
have been known to regen back to full before the end of a fight!
