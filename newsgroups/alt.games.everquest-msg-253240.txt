Its a good policy. But not everyone subscribes too it, and that puts all 
the 40 year old, bald, fat men, who just wanted to roll a female elf for 
roleplaying purposes in the awkward position of having to deal with the 
inevitable misunderstandings when people don't get it.

How should they deal with it? Should they lie and let people think 
they're girls and comply with the pervert weirdo stereotype? Or should 
they come clean with their guildies and ensure no misunderstanding is 
allowed to perpetrate the moment it becomes clear that people have the 
wrong idea.

It seems a simple choice to me.
