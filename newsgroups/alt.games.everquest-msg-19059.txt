I think that they should at least learn how to play first. When people bug
me for sow's and TP's when im wielding stuff that is almost always held by
enc's, I get annoyed... It's also bad when a level 55 asks for a port, and
he is serious. Very sad.... So, I say, have your fun. If they had played the
game, they would have known what they were doing and not be asking a necro
for sow's, and most 31 people know the j/tboots line (Soandso begins to walk
faster).
