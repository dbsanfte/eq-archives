TOS would not usurp the bill of rights, as the bill of rights do not
apply as restrictions on corporations or individuals. They restrict
the government only.

I, as an individual, nor an ISP, as a private company, cannot violate
your free speech. In either case, if you were successfully silenced,
no violation has occoured simply because neither of us would represent
a governmental entity. 
"Congress shall make no law.."

I do not "hate" the end times loon, I simply want him to go to the
appropriate newsgroups, or stay on topic. If he/she/it chooses not to
do so after sufficient warning, then other actions are warranted.
He/she/it does not need to shut up, only to go to the appropriate
groups where people have chosen to view such things.
