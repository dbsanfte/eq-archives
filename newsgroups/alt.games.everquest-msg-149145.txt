It also can save time.  I wanted to see if root was reliable enough that I
could med back significant mana while waiting for it to break, and so wanted
to practice somewhere safe.  I went to EC and picked a guard.  I didn't
realize they are wimps except for Seargant Slate, so blasted this poor guard
with an Ice Comet.  It killed him.  Oops!

When I looted, I found he was carrying the latest issue of whatever the
newspaper is that is sold outside the *Qeynos* bank.  Qyenos is pretty out
of the way (this was before they moved the West Karana abscond point to the
QH side of the zone), so getting the paper by nuking a guard would be a lot
faster than going to Qeynos, assuming it is a common drop. :-)

I didn't find out if it common, because I then switched to Seargant Slate
for my experiments, because I did NOT want to kill guards.

I few levels later, I did kill kill Slate, but he provoked me, by being blue
and not having a lot of HP. :-)
