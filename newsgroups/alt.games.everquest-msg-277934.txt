The spells up to level 68 are easilly obtainable, there are plenty of 
people selling the runes, and there are a fair number of single group 
mobs that can drop those runes.  The level 69 and 70 (not ancient) runes 
are reasonably obtainable, if you can get a decent group going in RSS, 
and to a lesser degree (drop infrequently), in MPG.  (I have all of my 
level 69 spells, but none of my 70 spells).  I will add, that unless you 
have friends to play with, getting groups for RSS is not all that easy 
anymore, at least not on EMarr.  The GoD spells are more obtainable now, 
as they have changed the KT flagging requirement to just require the Tipt 
trial.  (mind you, I have none of my GoD spells).
