"Gee, I'm sorry that your house has been broken into and all your
personal belonging stolen.  However, because it's *possible* that
you lent the crook your key, we're going to have to condemn the
house and you lose everything, no questions asked. Goodbye."

Sounds fair huh?  Kinda like the "hacking policy"...  I don't
understand why this "you're guilty and I'm not going to listen"
tone from Verant is so hard to comprehend, but it's as obvious
as daylight to me.

Agreed -- but I think that they could have done it in a less "I don't
give a shit about you" sounding manner.

No, but one can assume that the upcoming deluge of MMP online games
would indicate that there's plenty of money to be made in the market.
Companies don't just fund and spend years building complex software
and server set-ups if there isn't money to be made.

As do I.  My main beef is the attitude which Verant seems to have
with the way they phrased those clauses in the policy.  There are
plenty of companies out there who have to deal with similar concepts
like cheaters, thieves, etc. and they don't make the normal Joe Blow
consumer feel like he's a criminal.  They could have made the same
CYA policy in a more "humane" sounding manner.

Well, you're correct, of course, but in a "time of need" like the
poster was in, it would be good Public Relations to at least appear
like you might really give a shit about the person on the other
end of the phone/e-mail.  If you called your credit card company
and reported your card stolen and they told you "oh well -- piss
off and the bill is still due no matter what's been charged" you'd
be rightfully upset.  The concept is Customer Service not Customer
Abuse.

The moral of my story is that there would have been a less "edgy"
way of accomplishing the same results than what Verant chose.  End
of story.
