I have been, worked in a warehouse and a bottling company to. I just
was better at system admin. Stuff does happen beyond control, and I'll
admit to having unscheduled downtime occasionally. However, I'll also
say that I have only missed bringing my machines back online ontime
during a scheduled patch once in the last four years (roughly 40
downtimes). Verant used to miss every time, but they have been a
little better lately. As for attitude, thats what makes me good at my
job and why I get paid a lot of money to do it. I work hard and the
people working for me work hard to meet our service level agreements.
We meet these because we know how to plan, have the infrastructure in
place and put a lot of thought into each and every outage to be sure
we have everything in order. I know I'm good at what I do. Perhaps it
wrong to expect as good a service to me as a customer as I give my
customers? Then again, I guess other than release from the real wrold,
its not that important the EQ is up. Where as my company loses
millions if the computers aren't up. So, if that means I have an
attitude, so be it.
