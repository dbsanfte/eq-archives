Repeatedly in recent threads I've been advised to get a horse.

After resisting for ages, I finally bit, PoP makes sit aggro
something to be avoided if at all possible.

My understanding was that I could eliminate most of my objections
to the horse by leaving the horse model turned off.

I'd lose the added run speed (but heck, the pony I bought is
slower than run 3 anyway) but also the annoying animation, the
bobbing movement, the gradual acceleration and worse
deceleration, the trading troubles... apparantly all that would
remain of the horse would be the one feature I wanted a horse
for, the ability to regen mana as if sitting, without sit aggro
or having to actually toggle sit on and off.

Well I got the tan rope bridle, played with the visual model for
a while.. was fun for a couple minutes but got old fast,
especially the movement thing.  Oh, and not being able to see
properly in first person view.

Later, I logged out, switched horse model off, and back on.  To
find, to my dismay, that you can't summon a horse with the horse
graphics off!

Am I doing something wrong, or did I misunderstand something, or
was this a cruel practical joke?

The fact that I can't use YV at all with the horse up was
something I was forwarned about, although I can't see why they
coded it this way; I'd understand not giving me the mana regen
part, but I need that attack boost and dex boost to melee
effectively!  Why without YV, my Dex never gets close to 270 no
matter what I'm buffed with.  How am I supposed to live without
my hammer chain proccing 3 hits out of 4?
