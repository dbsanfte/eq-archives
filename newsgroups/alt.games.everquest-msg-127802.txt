I didn't say it can prove, I said it can *explain*. You can't know if it's 
the right explanation, but you can argue it's the only reasonable 
explanation.

Er, yes. Whales evolved from cow-like mammals who returned to the sea around 
50 million years ago. Some species of snake also sport pelvic bones, because 
they evolved from legged reptiles. Unless, of course, God does have a sense 
of humor and made them that way.

Who knows? Unlike creationism, evolution does not need to justify an intent. 
Thinks basically happen by chance, and if they don't kill you before you 
pass your genes to the next generation, you're stuck with them.

Hm... Adam lived 900 years. Metuselah lived what, 800 years? I wouldn't call 
our lifespans appropriate, I think we're being seriously short-changed here.
