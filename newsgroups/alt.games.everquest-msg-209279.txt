1) HGs are tough xp, they hit harder and have higher hp than many mobs
their level, especially old world mobs.
2) I have hunted HGs when they were red cons, solo with a Druid and
grouped with two different Paladin, and one of the Paladin was on a
high population server, so I just don't see your last assertion as
true.
3) Anyplace in EQ that's got something above average to offer attracts
lots of players, assholes among them.  I've seen more bad behavior in
Highkeep than in RM.
