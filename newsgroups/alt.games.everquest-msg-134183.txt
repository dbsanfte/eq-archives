Actually, though the patch message doesn't spell it out, when the leader
goes LD the leadership should pass on to someone else, making regrouping
unnecessary.

At least, that's how it was advertised on test, and the patch message today
implied they did something about it.  Assuming it's not bugged (patch = new
& improved bugs) that headache (or at least annoyance) should be over.
