The problem with root/parking is that the MOB's can still hit if someone is
in range of them.  With mezz of course this doesn't happen.  It can be very
difficult to get a MOB out of the area in order to park it where it can't do
damage.  Try pulling a pet off a root parked MOB and get it to assist-it's
very difficult.  Mezzing automatically stops the pet from attacking and
allows it to be redirected.

Canni is wonderful and when I try playing any other class it's one of the
things I miss the most.  BUT it's not perfect.  It still takes time to Canni
up that mana and it can't be done when you are being hit or when trying to
cast other spells.  It has to be done between pulls and when pulls are fast
incoming that doesn't leave much time.  Also, it does reduce HP.  So once a
shaman has been beat on he can't Canni without the worry of lowering HP too
much and taking low HP aggro.

Since there is no specific definition of what constitutes "over-powered"
then it's very difficult to refute your argument.  What makes a class "over
powered" veries from one person to the next.  Is a Wizard or Druid or Bard
over powered because they can solo multiple MOBS at one time?  Because a
Bard can swarm kite?  I know someone who has both a bard and shaman at 55+
and has levelled his Bard far faster than I levelled my shaman.  Does that
make a Bard overpowered?

What about a druid that can heal for 2k HP at the same level that I can only
heal for 650?

So what is your criteria for a class to be "over powered"?

Yeah it does, because we all play our classes and know the strengths and
weaknesses of them.

Really there is such  a wide variety among the classes that it's not even
comparing apples to oranges, it's more like comparing Steak and Oranges.
There's really no point to it.
