You think thats bad?

Theres a new guild on my server that does drive-by guildings

Had 2 of my characters and 1 of my friends that I was leveling while he
worked when I was at his house one day get a guild invite without them even
saying a word.
gee... wonder what that "NO" button does....

Beware the guild "Overlords"....

Apparently they also did a, get this, BLACKBURROW raid...  I did one of
those, SOLO.
