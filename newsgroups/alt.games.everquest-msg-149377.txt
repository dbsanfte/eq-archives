Not that I don't sympathise with you, but I'm nearly in tears here
laughing as I imagine an invisible guide standing about ten feet from

Guide_01 says, 'Watch this... I just told him it was all clear.'
Guide_02 snickers

You have entered Kithicore Forrest

Uberplayer_01's_Pet hits YOU for 172 points of damage!
Uberplayer_01's_Pet bashes YOU for 123 points of damage!
Uberplayer_01's_Pet kicks YOU for 79 points of damage!
Your head explodes into flames!
Blood shoots out of your ears!

Guide_01 rolls on the ground, laughing insanely
Guide_02 collapses holding his ribs

Guide_01 says, ' *gasp* Did you SEE that??!!'
Guide_02 says, 'MUA H AHA HA HA HA.'
Guide_02 says, 'Stop! You're killing me!.. no wait... Do it again!'
