I thought it was common knowledge that up until 9-11-01 the IRA received
significant funding from America.

This only stopped after the WTC attack, when Bush released his "banned
organisations and frozen assets" list of world-wide known terrorist
organisations

I thought the imminent attacks against Iraq are because of Iraqs "weapons of
mass destruction" which threaten the "free world".. not because they support
their ally?

Im not saying your wrong here.. it likely is true.  But where is it
relevant?
Because Palestinians use this aid to kill innocent Jews?

Well if you didn't notice, Israel has been doing the exact same for a long
time, killing innocent Palestinians..  Invading their lands, treating them
like shit, and killing them.  Killing people with tanks and the like... bomb
on a bus or attack-hellicopter.. its still deaths of innocent people and
completly wrong.

Did you read much of the recent court-case in Israel?  Israeli soldiers went
to court in an attempt to not serve in the west bank, because they didn't
want to be a part of the inhumane treatment of the local Palestinians.
