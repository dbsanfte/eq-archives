Think of it this way -- there's a Coke machine on the corner
that sells cans of Coke for 75 cents.

Person A walks up to it and drops in a single quarter.
He gets no Coke, of course, but the machine remembers
that 25 cents has been put into it.  Person A stands
around, or walks away, whatever.

Person B walks up to it, either immediately, or even hours
later, and drops a second quarter into it.  Still no Coke,
since Cokes cost 75 cents.  But the Coke machine knows
that 50 cents has been put into it, and it patiently
awaits a third quarter.

Person C walks up to the Coke machine, maybe right after
person B, or maybe long after, and drops in a quarter.
He gets the Coke, because the machine sees that it now
has a full 75 cents, and says, "here's your Coke".

Quest NPCs that require 2 or more items work exactly the
same way.  They don't care who gives them which of the
required items, they "remember" how many of the required
items they've gotten so far, and when they finally get
the full list of what they require, they give out the
quest reward to whoever handed in an item that filled out
the list (like the third quarter in the Coke example).

Using multiple people in this way to get a quest done
is called "multiquesting", or "MQ'ing" for short.

Usually, of course, players just hand the full list
of items to the quest NPC all at once and get their
reward right away (just as most people dump 3 quarters
at the same time into the Coke machine for their Coke).

But given the way that the Coke machine/quest NPC works,
if you wish you can have two or more people hand in each
"piece" of the required "price", one after another.

The only thing to remember is that with quest NPCs,
any item that is handed to them by someone with insufficient
faction for the quest gets "eaten" -- the quest NPC
destroys the item upon receipt, and that item does *not*
count towards the "completion list".  Someone else with
proper faction will have to hand in the item for it to "count"
towards the "completion list".

Also, like a Coke machine that gets turned off for the night
and forgets whether anyone has already put a quarter or
two into it not, a quest NPC's "memory" of which items have
already been given to it so far will be reset when the servers
go down and are restarted.
