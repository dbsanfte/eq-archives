God told me that this forum that I have chosen is more suitable than =
every single Christian church in the world to say what I need to say, =
and the audience here is more worthy to read my words than the audience =
in any Christian church.

He also said that a lot of kids in the three video game groups would be =
saved and that was a very good idea, and most of my eventual reward will =
come from doing that. Also said no one from pagan or feminism groups =
would be saved and that more people from the mercedes group would =
benefit than the christian.last-days group.
