Nice, but still slow for an AE group.  I'm not going to tell you
where, but there are zones that have better AE exp than the common
ones that most folks use.

Yep, pretty much right on, though I've certainly done it with a single
enchanter with very good results.

I've rarely done it this way, just because I hate having to run and
aggro a bunch of mobs, bring them back, aggro more, etc.  I prefer to
have my entire group put me on auto-follow and I rush around aggroing
mobs willy-nilly until I have a HUGE group behind us.  The 4-mob limit
can be a real pain in the ass when you're looking for a good pull,
especially in the zones that I find best for AE.  Having the entire
group running around ensures that you get at least 24 mobs on you,
which is a pretty good run since several of the mobs in the zones we
use are 55+.
Also, the enchanters don't have to waste mana mezzing and remezzing as
the puller brings more mobs.  I just make a "PIT STOP COMING, BE READY
TO BLAST" key and spam it a couple times before I duck into a
convenient corner, and the rest of my group sets up to start blasting.
It probably wouldn't work as well with another puller, but from my
experience it's the best way to pull.  I've used AE fear to pull
before, but then mobs come back at staggered times, and it's not
nearly as easy.

Also, Upheaval or whatever their AE spell is can be quite useful.  I
have friends who get 4 clerics, a puller, and an enchanter together
and AE that way too.

A bard should almost never get hit while pulling.  Running at 2.5
times the speed of the mob makes it quite easy to zoom by just out of
melee range.  Also, bards have an 18-second DA.  I have yet to find a
pull (non-HT mobs) that I can't live through with Selos and DA.  It's
really nice on long pulls too, because it's group DA, so if my group
is up to it I can pull a BIG train, hit DA right when the first mobs
get to us, and have 18 seconds to get the mobs positioned well.
Chanters can just keep pounding their stun spells, as soon as DA wears
off they'll cast.

I've found a way to combat this, generate more aggro than a resisted
stun.  In the time it takes an enchanter to cast his stun I can drop
an AE DoT/slow on the whole pile, and within 9 seconds can have 3 AE
DoTs on them, one with slow, one with snare.  It seems
counter-intuitive to be dotting mobs that you want mezzed, but my
enchanters stun rather than mez, and they chain stun.  I end up
getting attacked while the enchanter ends up relatively unharmed.

If the shit is hitting the fan you messed up the pull.  A second
cleric would be nice, but would be much better casting Upheaval.
Wizards do more damage per blast.  That's why they're more desired.

In that party there you might end up having the druid handle heals and
have the 2 clerics nuking, it could work, but would take some time to
learn.

Yeah, but the level 60 DA spell is a get-out-of-death free card.  It's
the difference between 30 exp gains, and a TPW in some cases.

Stun, don't mez.  Much lower mana cost, faster casting, and nukes
break mez, so a 6-second stun is as useful as a 120-second mez.  As
long as their stuns hit, it's all good.

I'll let the skirts explain which spells they use.  As far as I'm
concerned, Cheal, Aego, TL, ports, and CoH are all they're good for in
my book.  :)

This is one you'll have to figure out yourself.  My secret spot is
staying secret if I can help it, though a cleric in another guild
knows about it from tagging along with me once or twice.  (Hmmm, it's
odd, but I enter certain zones and get tells from characters asking to
join whatever I'm doing, damn loose lips sink ships.)

I know that on Innoruuk there are regular threads about setting up AE
groups on our server forum, and that there is an AE channel.  The best
way to get an AE group though is to be known as someone who organized
them.  Folks will learn, and start asking you every time you're on if
you're leading an AE group.
