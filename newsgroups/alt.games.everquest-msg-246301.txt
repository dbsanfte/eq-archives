I'm not happy at all with the new higher cap.  I just started playing EQ about 
a year ago and my main is lvl 64.  I've really been exp grinding cause I want 
to hit that 65 plateau so I can really start having fun.  It seems the game 
doesn't really begin until you're 65 and I'm almost there.  I don't want to 
just reach that level and then have to keep doing it some more.  I think this 
is happening because most players have multiple 65 toons and they need another 
goal to keep them playing the game or sony feels they will lose subscriptions.
