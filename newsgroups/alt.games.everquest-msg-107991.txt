It sounds as if this person LIKES to do it because it's fun and a challenge
for them to see how long it takes them to get a character to a certain
level.
I don't understand why people chime in with things like this on seemingly
innocent questions... Yeah, maybe that's how YOU like to enjoy the game, but
everybody is different.
Nobody should be telling anybody else how to enjoy their gametime.
I understand that you weren't saying "well do this instead", but it did seem
a bit condescending when I read it.
Forgive me if I read too far into it and this was just a curiosity type
inquiry, but people on this NG tend to be a bit... "elitist" a little too
often and it's annoying as hell.
