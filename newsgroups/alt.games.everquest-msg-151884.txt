I try to balance it out. I do not have higher level gear. So I can't
melee as well as I would like. I'm a "Ghetto BeastLord" :-) It is fun
and challenging. Unfortunately it forces me to rely heavily upon my
Warder's damage output.

Since the patch I have tried to hunt in Great Divide (giants and
wolves for faction and RP). They seem to resist the pet process quite
a bit. I moved to Rathe Mountains to make some cash (and RP) and had
the same problem with Hill Giants. With the resists and an occaisional
bad run of luck with the random number generator, I have found hunting
to be more frustrating than fun.

I realize that my choice of mobs is my main problem. It just irks me
that I will have to change my hunting grounds to offset the "upgrade"
Verant bestowed upon my Warder. I roleplay giants as my "racial
enemy".

Like I mentioned in my first post. I will just fire up an alt on my
second account until VI gets around to fixing the Warder. I'm working
on an outline for an evil character, and I will use the time to flesh
out the characters background and decide on a class. (SK, WIZ, or NEC)
