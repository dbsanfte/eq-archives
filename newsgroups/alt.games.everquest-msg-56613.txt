Sorry, no.
Even in exp groups, when a warrior triggers /disc defensive, it's the
same as if his AC just jumped 300 points.  Warrior will outtank.

As for taunting, warrior taunt was capped at 200 (now 230) while SKs
had it capped at 180 (and I think still 180).

While spells are useful at generating aggro, a smart warrior can keep
aggro even from a SK.  My warrior twinkie has no problems stealing
aggro from SKs regardless of level.

Remember, there are more than one factor involved in generating aggro
and it varies from one type of mob to another.

>Ask casters who the better tank is :) 

Any half-wit healer will be able to tell you based on how many heals
they have to cast to keep a warrior alive vs. a SK alive.

What the hell does that have to do with tanking and taunting
abilities?
