GM is mentioned in guild-chat.. /who GM   yes indeed, theres a gm.  No
mental note of the name made, other than ackowledging hes in the zone... I
mean, there was no need to.

3 or 4 bards and rangers saying "Tunare isnt on track.. Tunare isnt in the
forest,, Tunare isnt in the Tree.."  (about 8lines)
/ who GM   hmm is the gm still here?    (about 2 lines of text.. players in
everquest - none found)
/who    hmm who exactly is in the zone..   (about 65 lines of text in total)
55 or so guildies saying "wtf?!" or varitations of it in guild chat   (60 or
so lines of text)
The loot discussion channel talking about it   (maybe 25 lines of text)
The pulling channel talking about it    (maybe 10 lines about it)
My group talking about it, and wondering WTF is going on.. (another 15 or so
lines of text)

Im pretty sure that alone cleared my chat buffer, whther it had occured to
me or not to check for the GM's name
