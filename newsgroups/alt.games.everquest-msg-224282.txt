Hardly.

When I MT a group with a Cleric I drop a couple 'dots on the Cleric
unless I'm already wearing Aego/Virtue/Bot9.  If I'm not MT I don't
need the extra hp anyway (if I do, I hand over the 'dots).  I get
plenty of free buffs from one source or another, as does most every
player I meet, it's just stupid to expect Clerics to subsidize the
group.
