Most of the component vendors also sell arrows.  Try Lanin in Kelethin or
Cloudchaser in POK.  Also Danon Fletcher in South Qeynos and Rytan in Shar
Vahl.
If you want to kill and LOOT arrows go to Blackburrow.  The gnolls that are in
the room with the elites drop cheap bows and arrows.  When I was young and
broke thats how I got *all* my arrows.  They should be green to your shamy, but
the elites may be blue.  If you /ooc other players may let you loot them for
free.  A lot of people let them rot because they don't sell for much.
You can also /ooc politely in POK or in BB at the wayfarer camp for someone to
conjure you some.  My ranger has a Tolan's Darkwood Bracer and I like conjuring
arrows.  (Considering what I paid for it the more I make the happier I am :))).
 
I make all my arrows now but when I was young I really couldn't afford to.  Of
course things were different in the *bad old days*.
