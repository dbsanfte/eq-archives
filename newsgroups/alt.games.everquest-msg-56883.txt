All of your reasons could happen on a PvP server with PCs as well. After all
that is the nature of PvP. Players just show some courtesy and monsters do
not have to because they are time limited. They die and start a new one all
random. PvP servers have always had to have a PC guard in the newbie area
and even more so now. A couple of things I have noticed that I would like to
see changed on the MPCs.

1. If you get the experience for killing the MPC you do not get exclusive
looting rights right now. Anyone can loot it even if they did not even hit
it. Should be changed.

2. As a MPC you can access your inventory and destroy everything preventing
any loot from dropping. Should be changed.

3. MPCs are harder to kill and make leveling up slower for low levels so
experience should be increased for killing them.

4. As an incentive to go after them and to make them more acceptable how
about an uncommon to rare drop table for them? Maybe nodrop lore items for
their appropriate level just like the ones during the Halloween feast!


There are ways to deal with MPCs also. I have trained guards on them several
times by fighting a regular MoB and letting it chase me past a guard. The
guard will chase it as you lead it to the MPC. Then they are both dead. =)

As far as bind point camping the first thing you should do is set up to
rebind your character inside the city or very close to the guards. I have
always thought that the original bind point for DEs and Iksars was too far
from the city to start with. Iksars at least have a guard that patrols by
theirs but not the DEs.
