You bring up an interesting point. What percentage of the current EQ
playerbase would want to play a non-combat oriented game? Given the
completely broken state of tradeskills in EQ, the 400k+ subscribers
are more than content with (or at least willing to accept) a
kill-loot-advance system.

The numbers playing first person shooters like CounterStrike blow EQ
out of the water. The average Internet-Joe-Gamer likes fighting games.

Can SWG sustain a large population of non-combatants? I suddenly hear
a voice in my head shouting "SIMS IN SPACE!" (forgive me for that
Muppet flashback) I personally don't think that non-combat professions
will outnumber or even equal all of the smugglers, bounty hunters, etc
etc, in SWG.

It will be interesting to see.
