My definition of socialism is the goverment owns the means of production and
directs the populace portion of that production in how to act and what part
of their labor they can keep for themselves and here is how you may spend
it.

The third reich did most certainly qualify . As many goverments have found ,
it is damn hard to keep those pesky overachievers from finding some way to
get ahead in life. Though they sure as hell tried. Oh and I AM NOT A
CONSERVATIVE. You are right in that i particularly dislike socialists.
