At first, I was wondering what PETA would think, but then I got an even more
fearsome thought.  What would Ted Nugent say?

"You mean you're not going to eat what you killed?  You're going to waste
the sacrifice of these noble creatures who died so that you can live?"  Ted
Nugent opens a can of whoop-ass on Oasis poachers.

Of course, then he'd box the player around the ears, and force them to go
outside and hunt something.
