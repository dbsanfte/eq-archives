Shammies cannibalizing regularly when they have nothing better to do (after
slow/debuff/dot or when pulling) keep manareg up better then necro's.

Shammie using Canni5 is best for 1 tick, but mages are masters of pure mana
reg in downtime. Can't beat a fully buffed pet-reclaiming mage. Heck I
outpace fully buffed shammies just after I get rezzed and I still need to
get better items and aa to speed things up more. Only problem is shammies
lose so damn much hp that it's dangerous to use if you don't have 3k hp+ and
mages have no defense up when rmaking mana :). Necro's have less of a
problem with that because of FD and heal-over-time dots and lifetaps.

All things considered, it doesn't really matter but it's fun crunching
numbers.
