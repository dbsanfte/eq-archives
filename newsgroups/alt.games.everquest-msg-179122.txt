Just restricting you to lv 50 if you had any expansions installed would
probably require that.  If you wanted to make any other changes, say
putting casic thule back the way it was would require that.  Say you
want the old UI, same again.

On second thought It's probably a really bad idea.  I remember
pre-kunark only too well, I wasn't able to get my shaman past 36 because
of 6 hour waiting lists to get into a group anywhere, seeing as how I
can usually only play about 4...

Also look at Firona Vie and the other servers with weird rules.  They
are all under populated, it probably would be too, and therefore not
worth the money to them.
