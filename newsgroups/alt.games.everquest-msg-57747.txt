So, I guess you think I asked for all these 'teenage cheerleader
sluts' spam? :p (I did get porn ads offering me to see guys jingle
their bells for me last Christmas, though)

And when I called bulk mail services my favorite, I'd forgotten about
all those fucking annoying ads, arriving under assorted different
headers, which all contain the same "buy patriotic angel and flag and
eagle and bullcrap pins and t-shirts and flags and hood ornaments to
show you're a Real American Patriot(tm)" message. They'd have annoyed
the hell out of me even if I'd been American...
