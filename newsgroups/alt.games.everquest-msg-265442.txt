That's nice, but CoH is the one that owns the content and makes the 
rules. You agree to abide by those rules each and every time you log on. 
So do the rest of us, multiplied by tens of thousands. We keep on paying 
the US$14.95 a month, indicating we're rather happy with the game and 
it's rules.

Yup - Arseholes *are* inevitable in every single MMORPG - Human nature 
dictates it. What is it, specifically, that you want to be done to 
protect your delicate sensibilities from the arseholes ?

Have you looked through the boards on coh.com ? The devs most definitely 
do acknowledge kill stealing - They also suggest a much more mature way 
to deal with it: Someone who casually throws a single hit on "your" mob 
as they run by can be dealt with simply by you not killing the mob (no 
exp given, so their tactic is useless) - If someone is persistantly 
following you around and taking kills that you are involved in, you can 
petition a GM for harassment.

Actually, many people half-sane and more have exactly such policies. It's 
much the same in UO, D2, etc. As I ask below, what do you suggest can be 
*done* to deal with harassment as *you* define it ? Be aware that there 
are costs involved, since it's not just *you* that has to be hand-held in 
the game, but tens of thousands of others, as well, should your 
definition of rules enforcement (as you seem to be suggesting) be 
applied.

And how do you enforce this 'rule' ? Last night, I was beating down a 
Caliban with my Ice/Emp controller and someone whizzed by me, threw a 
Chillblain on the Caliban then entered a mission. I still "got" the kill, 
but not all the exp. By convention, the kill was "mine", but there's 
really nothing that the devs can be expected to do about people being 
arseholes. (Hint: If you don't like the wide variety of variables that 
human interaction introduces, you should check out single player games)

Back to enforcing the rules: Are you willing to pay $19.95 a month ? 
$29.95 a month ? Cost would have to go up if you need a staff member to 
deal with all the arse-hole incidents in the game.

Okay, so what is it, exactly, that you want ? Do you want the whole game 
to be instanced every time you enter combat to ensure that whatever 
happens to be within X meters of your 'char to be 'yours' ? 

I've seen you whine about KSing in this thread without making any 
concrete suggestions as to what you think could or should be done about 
it. I suspect I know what you'll suggest and I suspect it's wholly 
unrealistic, yet I hold out hope that I am mistaken.
