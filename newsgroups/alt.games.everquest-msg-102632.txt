yeah ughhhhh that ec is so spammed it makes my head hurt nothing bugs me
worse than your kind spamming the same crappy item every 3 seconds then
eventually doing a /shout SOMEONE BUY MY <INSERT LAME ITEM HERE>  that
irritates me more than people will know. just out of curiosity does anyone
know the limit on how many people u can ignore right now im ignoring like 12
(damn people begging etc)
