The possibility exists that this is a new spawn added on test to make 
entry camping more "challenging". *cough*. But if not, then it sounds 
like a bug.

The mob that magically "appears" there near the water is, in fact, a 
visual bug from further in. But it's not always a rock golem. I've seen 
it be a fiend and a revenant on many occasions. (I spent a long time 
leveling there back in the day on my first main.) He won't aggro even if 
you stand on top of him. But the bitch of it is you can target him and 
aggro him. Then he immediately disappears (back to his true location, I 
assume) then warps back to you a few minutes later for real, followed by 
an absolute train from hell.

Oh, and for the poster that said the undead are just down in the undead 
city, not actually. You start runnign into them as soon as you get to 
the second castle type entry with a pool. It's also around where you run 
   into your first rats, providing you didn't detour into the jail.
