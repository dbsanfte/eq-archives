It's crappy, and gets overwritten by just about anyone elses AC buff, but 
it does exist.

Root, Poison/Disease resist group buff, Poison/Disease group cure (18 
counters each, one spell), decent DoTs (DoTs are rarely very group 
friendly though, as it makes switching targets and mezzing a mob a tad 
difficult.), inefficient DD spells, long lasting UV/See invis/Stamina 
regen spell (single and group), various sight enhancement spells, EB.  
Resist debuffs, including unresistable ones which can come in very handy 
as they stack with enchanter tash line.
