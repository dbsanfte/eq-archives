Well yes definitely if you are just looking to the atlas as a way of
getting around.  I find the background information mildly entertaining
though.

The more I look through it, the more massive errors I am finding.  Some
of the maps have the wrong legend matched up with them.  Some of the
maps have letters on them with no corresponding entry on the legend.
Some of the maps have incorrect legend entries.  Many of the maps have
north pointing in the wrong direction.  Its really a very Verant
product.
