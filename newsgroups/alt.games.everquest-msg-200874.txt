Sorry.  I don't believe you when you claim that your level 52 cleric
had +100 mana or more on every item with the exception of 2 or 3
slots, when you claim not to be twinked or particularly rich, or that
you wouldn't have any FT or focus items.  I also find it puzzling that
you forgot specialization as a reason for your skewed findings in your
experiments, and that you wouldn't consider it an issue, considering
how you claim you did your tests.  If you had packet sniffed that
would be one thing, but when you cast a spell and notice that it costs
10% of your mana bar, of course specialization would skew your
results.

And your last part isn't particularly clear.  Did you start solo
nuking Happ at 52 or 44?  Or are you now claiming you had 3900 mana at
44?  And why would there be a skewed result between your evoc and your
alteration tests?  I mean, if you achieve one result from alteration,
evoc should give you similar results, but you're claiming that they
actually were different when you take the reduced mana cost from
specialization.  And let's not forget that unless you never put any
points into Specialize: Evocation, you'll still get specialization
applied to your nukes, just not as often as you would see it for your
heals.

And to claim that you have all these +100 mana items but no mana
preservation or flowing thought (that earring is a joke to get)
strains credibility just a little.
