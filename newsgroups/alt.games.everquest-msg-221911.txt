there are only a limited number of mobs that are "uncharmable".  Uber
Dragons/Giants and anything 65 and up off the top of my head but lucy should
have the full exclusion list in the spell description...maybe not...but i
charmed a rock in an LDoN adventure last night and hit had been buffed by
another npc nearby apparently because it had feedback, alacrity, strenth,
and something else...was funny to see some low level chanter spells being
cast on what was going to turn into my pet.  What also struck me as funny is
that some mobs start with buffs on them and some get casted, but i thought
they limited mobs to 8 spells like players in a patch a long time ago...is
that a foggy memory experience coming back to trick me?
