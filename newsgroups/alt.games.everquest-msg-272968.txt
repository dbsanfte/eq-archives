I would verify that your memory is working correctly, theres a chance it 
could have some defects pages in it.   These wouldnt necessarly show up in 
game which doesnt stress it as much.

You can download a good memory tester from http://www.memtest86.com/ , once 
you have made the necessary disc/cd up, you should let the program run for 
approx 1-2 hours whilst testing the memory, if any errors come up then you 
need to replace it.
