Hey Graeme, nice to see you still around, I've been out of the NG for about
a year or so

I have the key to the building (Stone Key) but don't think I have the one
from The Hole.  I don't need the elevator, but the 2nd building up in the
skywalks.  I may try the pillar part, I think it still works.  My Enchanter
is 65 and I didn't really wanna drag a rogue all the way out there just to
open a door for me so I could sit there and camp Wraith, but guess I will
(c;

cheers
