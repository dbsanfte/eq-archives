They keep doing this, and it just annoys the crap out of me.  They don't 
add new content, they just move stuff around and change the art.  In the 
meantime, they make the zone laggy as all hell, and make the maps 
obsolete.  As a side effect, they make old writeups about the locations 
of quest mobs obsolete as well... but there I can't honestly complain, 
as using walkthru's isn't an inherent feature of the game.

If they added new content, I'd be all for this kind of thing, by the 
way; its just that to me, a graphic update on a zone practically nobody 
uses is a colossal waste of time

Oh, and "pullulates"... is that a word?

I don't know what clickable auras are or what the old cast times were. 
If they used to be instant, this is a big nerf, means  you can't cast on 
the move or in a non interruptible way.  If they used to be slower, I 
guess this is a boost?

Mage buddy just noticed this effect, got new minion of darkness gloves 
out of Vex Thal and they didn't make any difference to his pet... until 
he put his LDoN diamond in inventory.

Yeah, thats not a noticeable change!

Unholy Steed was messed up as of last patch, it vanished from your AA 
list if you'd purchased it.  I had to clear my UI due to a bug, and the 
only way I got my pony working again was to look up the /alt action 
number for it (85)  Maybe this fix had something to do with that?

Least popular AA ever?  No wonder I never heard it was broken, I never 
heard of anyone who bought it!

Glad to see the AA consolidation was so well checked before being put 
into play.  Thats a LOT of stuff that didn't work right!

Can't believe thats a 6 hour patch.  Sounds like the sort of thing they 
used to do in two or three.

I mean, its obviously not as though they use the remaining time for testing.
