No, I am saying that without proper respect for fellow players, on line
gaming is doomed to be a frustrating series of interactions with people
who make games less enjoyable.  Sort of defeats the purpose of on line
gaming, which should involve the enjoyment of interacting with others. 
Those who feel no compunction to respect others should stick to single

otherwise.  The initial status is equality, to assume any other position
is patently unfair to you and to me.
