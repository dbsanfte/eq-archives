Depending on how I felt about the group at that point, I would have either 
just left or I would have started looting everything that dropped.  After 
about the 3rd loot in a row, they would all be wanting to ask "WTF are you 
looting everything for?" so before they asked, I would have tossed out a 
"Sorry, guys, gotta grab some loot so I can get that KEI." and then kept on 
looting until you got 50pp or the equiv in stuff.
