I think it's around 8-12khp on Seb frogs

hehe yeah, is it telk? who drops the SK gear in ToV,  and the sk weap from
the ring war is pretty nice too.

My sk hasn't upgraded his gear since like level 5 though, other then a piece
of PoF armour (legs or boots or something)   He may have been a twink at the
start, he's just average equiped now though (not that it matters, since AA
levels I barely play anything other then my monk (on 26th AA level so far)
and they are both on the same account, wheras my wizard (2 blue from 59) and
cleric (58) are on diff accounts, and I can play 2 of them at once

Heh dunno why.. i always figured bard weapons would be like 10/28 or
something :)
My main is only 17/25, so there isn't all that much difference

I thought all bugs and krups were 51+... i guess its only really important
to find out when you have level limits on your spells (e.g mez and charm)
