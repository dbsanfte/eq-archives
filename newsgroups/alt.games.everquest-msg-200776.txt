KEI might eliminate the need for a necro or shaman to use their
HP/Mana conversion tools.  Other than that limited example,
how's anyone *skills* change?   (And I'd even argue that the
only real *skill* that changes is low health aggro management,
something it's almost impossible not to learn for any class.)

Take a root/rot technique, for instance:  you still need to know how
to root.  You still need to know how to use DoTs.  So you can take
mobs with more HPs (more DoTs, more Roots.)   Or you throw in
a nuke to finish the mob off.   The *skill* involved is still the same.

Quadding is identical.  Again, you can take mobs that might take
more mana than you'd have otherwise, but you still need to know
how to quad.

Root/Nuke, same thing.  Charm soloing, same thing.

So that's pretty much solo techniques for casters, ignoring bards
since I'm not sure how KEI helps them.

In groups, a enchanter still needs to know how to mez, etc.  KEI
is just more mana.  Same for a cleric or other healer.  Heals are
heals, it's just more mana.  If it's the "but I can heal earlier"
argument for CHeals, that's nothing limited to KEI.  Lots of
clerics always healed earlier than necessary in XP groups;  their
groups just had downtime as a result.   Given the choice between
a "properly timed" CHeal and a safety margin, most (probably
all) *good* clerics take the safety margin anyway.  Wizards (or
mages or whoever's nuking) still get aggro and pounded when
they overnuke, so they still need to learn aggro management.

So, other than canni and the necro HP/mana line, what skills
exactly are being neglected?
