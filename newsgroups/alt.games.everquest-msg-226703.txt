I returned to EQ when LDON came out because it appealed to me so, and I love
the dungeons.  Now that I'm in my mid/late 50's the experience has slowed
down some for me, so I've been grouping some in PoN to try and move things
along.

I am SO BORED THERE.  LDON has spoiled me--there's always something new,
something exciting, you keep on your toes, and you know when you'll end, and
you *really* have to work as a group.  It's great.

I move to the PoN and it's the same old boring stuff, lather, rinse, repeat.
I have to be very careful I don't zone out or get overly distracted by small
distractions. (The latter happened last night and it helped get the Cleric
killed--as my mez was resisted it would've likely killed us both anyhow, but
that's still not any comfort, let alone an excuse for not being faster on
the draw.)

Not to mention in LDON, if something breaks mez and turns on me, I'll take
about 250 a round max in damage until it's off, while in PoN, I'll take up
to 500-600 a round depending on the mob.  That means even with temp on,
there's a good chance that I'm down in three rounds, faster than I can
channel a second mez attempt, usually.  It makes charming pets very
effective while it's on, and extremely lethal when it breaks.

I think I'll go back to LDON where I enjoy it more and stick to doing PoN
with guildies and friends where we give ourselves a challenge.

I :heart: LDON.
