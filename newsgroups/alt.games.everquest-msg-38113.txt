*shudder* Hate to say it but... Lake of Ill Omen. Possibly the worst 
overcrowded dumbass filled zones in the game. But easy to find a group. 
South Karana seems to be better these days also.

You will need to pick pocket for your epic quest. It will (of course) 
need to be maxxed.

What I normally do is announce to the group that I won't be looting at 
all since I practice PP. I do let them know that I will lotto for 
specials. I have it set up into my evade macro and most groups (at mid-
higher levels) aren't too concerned about coin loot. (At least in the 
groups I've been in.) Pickpocket is INFINATELY more rewarding. Also, if 
you pick gems and have a cleric in the group it is a good idea to donate 
them to them and words, runes, etc. to the appropriate class.

Yes, but then I see myself more as one of Antonius' "scouts" than a 
common thief. ;)
