I think Cam's post answers the question quite well:

"How can you tell the way the designers intended the game to unfold?
They never directly told you their entire idea, nor were you a part of
the team of designers."

I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask for supporting arguments for those
claims, because on their own they simply don't stand up.

Can you reference some statement wherein the designers made their
intent clear, or where they said that the blue servers was not meeting
that intent?
