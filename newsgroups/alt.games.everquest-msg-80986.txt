Shrug, I would say rather, any tank who has 2k+ or so of HP.

Also, something that will make your tank feel better and keep the
group sane as they get used to the wonder that is CH...

Make a hotkey that says:

/cast 2 (or whereever you keep CH memmed)
/g Be calm, Complete healing inbound for %T. 10 seconds till total heal.


If you feel like being spammy you can throw a gloaty message after a /pause
in there, but you look stupid when it hits on "A_Warriors_Corpse" ;-)
