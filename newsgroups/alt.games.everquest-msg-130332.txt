Never any bad experiences. When I upgraded to WinXP, I couldn't use
the free version I had of ZoneAlarm anymore and found that they
apparently don't offer a free version anymore... So, now I use McAfee.
However, McAfee kills my lag in EQ if I leave it active while I play,
so I have to turn its filtering off. :-/ Never had that problem with
ZoneAlarm.
