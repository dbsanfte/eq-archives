Subject: Obtainable item with vision buff?

Been in SolA for a couple days now trying to get a glowing stone band for my
Level 48 Human Pally.  I've never liked his poor vision but lately in some of
the LDoN's it's almost impossible to see without a vision buff on.  I've had no
luck at all finding the High Priest Shaman who supposedly drops the glowing
stone band.  I'm pretty sure I'm in the right spot, room right next to where
Lynada the Exiled spawns, but haven't been able to get him to pop and I'm
getting zero exp so I think I'm gonna give up.  Anyone have any suggestions for
an obtainable item with serpent sight or UV?  I'd rather not buy potions and
have something that's permanent.  TIA.
