We have 3 clerics in my guild who regularly attend our raids.  We are 65, 65
and 60.  The 60 has the epic / rez stick so that's part of her job.  We tried
Xanamech in Innovation last night and lost, but got it to 37%.  The plan was to
spam quick heals on the MT until Xan was slowed then group heal after that.
Unfortunately we didn't get Xan slowed until it was 79%, many quick heals
later.  I was cleric for group one, with our chanter and MT.  Chanter went down
not long after we got Xan slowed.  I was able to cast one group heal, one heal
on the chanter, and the rest of my mana was used on the MT / SMT, who's HPs
were yoyoing pretty wildly.
I ended up with yard trash agro and died while the (now rezzed) MT was still
up, but I was OOM anyway so I don't know that it really mattered.  
Afterward, one of the other clerics suggested the CHC to save mana and the
chanter agreed.  I can't figure out how we'd implement this within our ranks. 
We have one druid - we could put her on healing everyone but the MT and SA? 
Would that be feasible?  
Next question:  I often start a complete heal then duck out of it because it's
not really needed.  Is this acceptable in a CHC?  After all, the *next* guys CH
will hit in time right?  Then just continue on in the chain? But what if the
next guy has the same brainstorm and HE breaks out of his too? 
Also, I felt like I was *spamming* the healer channel with all my quickheals. 
Does every QH require a call - when things are particularly heinous anyway? 
I'm guessing people know what I'm doing without my calling it out every time.
Advise and suggestions welcome.
