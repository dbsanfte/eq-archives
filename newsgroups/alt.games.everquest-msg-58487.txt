I am on the camp, and worry that if I ever do get the Idol (range slot)
that I could lose it by throwing it as a weapon by mistake, like a
shuriken or a javelin.  That would be a huge, huge loss.  Does anyone
know if this is possible to do?  A very good monk I know told me it is
not...can anyone confirm this?
