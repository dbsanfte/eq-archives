The problem with that speculation is that multiple bard couldn't
stack their mana song if that were the case, and they can.  I can't
find the quote - but GZ likened CCC to a healing spell - the 
pc gets a single shot of mana each time the song is sung, as opposed
to regen songs which increase the amount per tick.  Every time a
bard pulse mana song it gives a single, instant, shot of mana to 
the people in the group.
