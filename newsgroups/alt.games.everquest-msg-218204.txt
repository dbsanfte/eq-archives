: How many more HP's would a warrior have v. paladin?

Not enough really to make a big difference.

: Would warrior AC be innately better or is that strictly gear based?

More gear based than anything innate.

: Damage output of both given equivalent weapons and str?

Well, given the state of 2h in the camp the DPS differnce is again
probably not very significant.

: Aggro management of warrior v. paladin? (no spells-more dmg v.
: spells-less dmg)

Pally agro >>>>>>>> War agro

: Overall value to group?  (not raid)

Pally probably way more group useful.
