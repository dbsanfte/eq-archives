Why bind at the bank, that seems a waste.

Porters should always bind at a zone line if they are playing Taxi;
that way you can be taxi driver for two zones instead of just one.

FV/LOIO would be one choice.  But why stop there?  LOIO/FM
will give you higher level clients with correspondingly higher level
cash.

Better still, get to Veliuos, ports out of Great Divide/Eastern Wastes
(another zone line) go for 50pp a head instead of the 10pp a head
you'll see in lowbie zones.  Funny thing is, it doesn't take a high level
druid to do this, they want ports -out- not -in-, and you can always
gate in!

I do the same thing if I want to make money doing res.  Go to where
there are dead people with money; not to somewhere where the people
are so broke that 50pp sounds like a small fortune, and straddle a zone
line so I can advertize to twice as many people.

Porting won't get you any exp, though, and the way to get 10kpp isn't
50pp at a time, its to level up into your 50s and kill stuff that drops
Kpp goodies regularly.

I also don't spend much time doing res for hire; usually I do that for free or
not
at all, as I can make more money fighting, and get exp while I do it.  There
are,
however, times when I have to be AFK a lot and can't reliably fight, I've
done the Res Whore thing then in order to buy at least a couple 5Kpp items.
