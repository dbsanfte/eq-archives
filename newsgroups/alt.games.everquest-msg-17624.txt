Haha, someone just trying to bump their prices up then. As it was I was
about to buy one for 100pp (for a friend) I just wanted to see if I could

Eek, Soul Leech has to be given away, bummer...I guess what you get is

Wow, best Item I think I've ever given away was a silvery war axe...took the
newbie a while to realise what he had at 4th level, finally got a tell of
"OMFG thankyou for the axe"
Newbies in Nek must just wait for you to go on hate raids ;�)
