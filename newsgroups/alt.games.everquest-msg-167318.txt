I certainly wouldn't assume I could just run with the big boys after taking
a character to 31 in Exp groups.
Hell, I wouldn't want to try it with any classes I have played upto 53rd. I
turned down an invite to Fear the other day saying it was not really the
place for a Raid newb like me, tbh this was part self preservation as I have
heard how crappy Fear can be...and by all accounts I was right not to go
along :ï¿½)
I don't really have a problem with anyone spending money on buying accounts,
I have a friend who has done it (after selling his old one and vowing never
to play EQ again) and Rastus certainly never seemed to do anyone any harm
but the justification you gave as an example doesn't cut it with me. If he
enjoys the game then why does he need to rush to 50/55/60+ why not just
enjoy the Journey like the rest of us under achievers?
