At some point in the past, mobs started to dispel random buffs instead of
only dispelling from the top.  I retired my shrunken goblin skull earring
at this time.

I am now being asked to acquire one for my guild, because apparently some
mobs do still dispel from the top.

Is this true? Some mobs dispel randomly, and some from the top down like
they used to?
