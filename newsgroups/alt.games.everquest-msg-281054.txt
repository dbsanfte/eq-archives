I dusted off my old level 40 bard, whom I haven't played in about a
year.  His Sense Traps and Disarm Traps were both at 120, and I seem to
recall that I capped those at the time.  His Pick Lock skill was at 20,
and I assume that was just where I got tired of dumping training points
into it.

EQDiva has a skills table.  It indicates that the skill caps for Pick
Lock, Sense Traps, and Disarm Traps are 125, 120 and 120 respectively.
These seem to be confirmed by postings on the site from late 2004.

One message there mentions the quickest and safest way to max Pick
Lock, for a 46+ character, is to click on a particular book in
PoTranquility.
