Hi. This is a way that I have found that you are capable of cheating at
Everquest. There are certain sites that have people's accounts and therefore
their characters stored on them. You can access your account by sending an
email to certain address that include your account name and password. By
doing this, the bot attempts to find your account and will send you a
feedback message with all of your character's equipment, Level, equipment,
character status (warning, ect.) and such. Once you receive this email you
can edit your character and send it back. But be warned that when editing
your character do NOT, I repeat do NOT, add anything that is impossible
(such as a level 61 or a level 1 character with 900HP) or the bots will
catch it and your account will get banned. It is not dangerous as long as
you just stick to the rules. Below I have the number combinations listed
that you need to edit your character. The underlined number is the one that
you need to change in order to change what you want. (Such as say 2888 0948
99901 is your characters level. By changing the 01 to 49 that would change
your character's lever to 49. I am still working on item codes. If you get a
hold of any item codes, please email me at shoalinn@hotmail.com. ) This is
the format that is needed to be in the email.

Account=*account name*

Password=*password*

Server=*server* (if your server has 2 names, just type in the first name.
Also, you must edit your character information by server, so if one
character you would like to edit is on Tallon, and another on Prexus then
you would have to view each character list seperatly)

Ok, here is the email address to send your information to in order to get
your character's information: eqstorage@hotmail.com . This is the only
address I have found that has a passage into the character storage site. I
hope this is as successful for you as it has been for me.



Here are the codes.



Level Select:

2888 0948 99901



Race Select (make sure you unequip all equipment before using this. I do not
yet have the file for the new cat race. Sorry.  01=Barbarian, 02=Dark Elf,
03=Dwarf, 04=Erudite, 05=Gnome, 06=Halfling, 07=Half Elf, 08=High Elf,
09Human, 10=Iksar, 11=Ogre, 12=Troll, 13=Wood Elf.)

9876 7596 94501



Class Select (make sure you unequip all equipment before using this. I do
not have the file for the beastmaster class. Sorry. Also do not change your
class to that which your race cannot use.  01=Cleric, 02=Druid,
03=Enchanter, 04=Magician, 05=Monk, 06=Necromancer, 07=Paladin, 08=Ranger,
09=Rogue, 10=Shadow Knight, 11=Shaman, 12=Warrior, 13=Wizard)

9876 0943 05801



Increase Hp Regeneration. (Permanent Chloroplast)

9802 8686 9203 420



Increase Mana Regeneration (Permanent Clarity)

9802 8686 9203 846



Increase Speed (Permanent S.O.W.)

9802 8686 0946 562



Increase Attack Speed (Permanent Haste 'I cant remember the spell name')

9802 8686 0946 563



Increase Number of Skill Points (the underlined number is the number of
skill points you will have when you log back on. It doesn't add the number
to your current number. The underlined number is the number of skill points.
You can have as many as you want, but you still can't put more in your
skills than your level allows, however you can max out all skills for your
level as soon as you reach it.)

6589 7583 9813 9764 94301



Well that's all for now. I hope that you find this little cheat as helpful
as I have. Good luck, and look me up sometime. I am on Rallos Zek(best pvp
server). My name is Elizz Treehugger . I will be looking forwards to hearing
from some uber characters soon!   =^)
