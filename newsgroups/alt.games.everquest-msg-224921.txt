In article <GKKub.114$5h1.8884@news.uswest.net>, Sean Kennedy quoted Sony:

Sounds useful.  Very similiar, it appears, to the combat styles in DAoC, and
those have worked out well for melee classes there.  They give a lot of flexibility
to melee classes.  See http://daoc.catacombs.com/stylelist.cfm for a look at the
DAoC styles.  If they indeed to do that kind of think in EQ, Warriors are in for
a lot less boredom in combat. :-)

(The new spell effects look similar to DAoC effects, too...maybe the next expansion
should be called "Dark Age of Norrath"? :-))
