Yeah, right...

I hear this whine every time an unreasonable pain-in-the-butt
"feature" is snipped out of the game.  When the inexcusable
40% hybrid experience penalty was finally removed, people
bitched and moaned that "now people will be able to get a
Paladin to 60 in just a couple of months", oh woe is me".

That was about a year ago -- where are all the spanking
new level 60 Paladins that were started in September?
For that matter, why's my two-year-old Paladin still
only level 56 if it's allegedly so damned easy to "whiz"
one to 60 now?

Get a grip.

"Why take pride in what you have slowly achieved"?  If
you really need an answer for that -- if it actually depends
on whether other people have to suffer through exactly
the same obstacles that you did, then you really don't
understand what pride is all about.  You might as well
ask, "why take pride in climbing a mountain when some
people take the bus to the top?"

You know what?  People have *already* gotten characters
of your class "whizzed through the game in a few short
months or weeks" via powerleveling, so hey, "why take
pride" in doing it the hard way without constant
handholding from high-level babysitters?  Might
as well quit now, eh?

I've had *fun* doing it the "hard way".  That won't
change if some of the things in the game are changed
to not be quite as insanely obnoxious as they had been.
