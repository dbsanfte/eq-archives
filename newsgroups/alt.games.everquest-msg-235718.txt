Answers from someone who is also fairly new

1: (Cleric - Eeek hard one to start with - I found beast usefull as
has all round abilities which help learn many types of play but is not
powerfull in anyone) Heal all you can they will appreciate and will
remember you but if you can ask first (make a button for ease) if they
are mid battle they will surely be pleased to see you.

2: Group - your a cleric groups will beg for you to be part of them,
but get used to sit heal sit heal ...... thats about all you do and
throw a few lulls etc (in the ealrly stages anyhow). Bad groups and
good groups - you win some you lose some take your chances. Just tell
your group your new if they are reasonable they will expect you to
make mistakes and cover for you - if there not dont concern yourself
too much.

3: I suffer the time problem alot - best thing is to just say.

Biggest thing I found in my first four months was that I didnt ask
questions now I do. A guilded person is usually good as they have been
around a while normally ( they have <guild name> under their character
name), but not always.

There are no stupid questions just stupid people who dont ask them!!

Hope this helps..
