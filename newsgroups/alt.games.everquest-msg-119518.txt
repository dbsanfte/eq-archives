    You complained that it seemed like you'd never make it to 60. I made the
assumptions that you want to get Jakugg to 60, and (based on posts about
Jakiss) that you're playing your wizard a great deal. Given that you aren't
a hardcore EQ fanatic that gets the shakes at the very idea of logging off,
I gave you advice on how you could get Jakugg to 60 in a reasonable time
frame.

    Being guilded now I get to see a lot of people at once and monitor them,
including a fair number who have started over as a new class and had to
level to 60. The ones that failed and got burnt out on EQ were the ones that
did XP either without breaks, or who took breaks from EQ itself when they
took breaks. I've found the ones who took the odd break, and stayed in game
when they took that break, made it through the easiest. I think it's because
people who stay in game can still see how much fun EQ can be, and rather
than hating the game for the misery of levelling they see levelling merely
as a hurdle to be overcome and are inspired by the fun they have doing other
things to press onwards. But I'm no psychologist.

    And if I was wrong in my assumptions, then *shrug*. Oh, you posted as
the wrong person.
