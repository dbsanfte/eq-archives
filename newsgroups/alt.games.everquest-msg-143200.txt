Earlier this summer I tested it (I believed at that time that
oldest first was how it worked) and found that it was random,
but more likely to nail the buffs at the top of the list than
the bottom (results were posted to a thread here).  Faned, at
least, believes that Dragon AE Dispell works differently than
other dispells, always killing top buff first, I cannot speak
to that.
