Bind in Ill Omen, and do the Bloodgill Goblins.  They will be blue, but they
only have about 1300 hp.  One Ice Comet does enough damage to make them
start running away slowly, so they are pretty low risk, if you are
comfortable dealing with underwater mobs.  If you've got a SOW and have
levitate up, it's not hard to swim down, find one and target it, and then
swim for the surface.  When you are near the surface, use Staff of Temperate
Flux, then breach the surface (lev keeps you out of the water), and run to
shore.  Root the goblin, and use Ice Comet.  You don't care if the Ice Comet
breaks root, unless the Ice Comet is partly resisted, in which case, just
run ahead, and reroot.

The only problem with the Bloodgills is that you'll kill them all, and they
aren't a quick spawn.  That's why you want to bind in Ill Omen.  You can
then gate in every so often and check to see if they are up.

Meanwhile, you use your ports between Bloodgill spawns to hit the following:

1. I *think* that there are still a fair number of blue Spectres in Oasis.
They have about 1700 hitpoints, move slowly, and will come one at a time, so
they are very easy.  Levitate, run out to within nuking range of one, cast
Ice Comet, and run back to shore, and finish it off when it gets there.

2. There's also the Spectres at the Fear cave.  That's not too far a run
from South Ro.  There's a single spawn outside the cave that spawns every 5
minutes 15 seconds.  You can also pull from the cave if you want.

3. Emerald Jungle has plenty of nice juicy blue stuff that you can kill,
although most of the things have something like 3500 hitpoints, if I recall
correctly, so you you'll use a lot more mana than you do against the
Bloodgills and the Spectres.

That's what I was doing at 50, I believe.  However, that was pre-Velious.
You might also take a look at Eastern Wastes.  That's where I finished off
52, so it should work at 50. :-)  The walrus' seem to be pretty low
hitpoints, and were mostly green at 52, with some light blue, and the
occasional dark blue, so I *think* there might be a lot of blues at 50.
