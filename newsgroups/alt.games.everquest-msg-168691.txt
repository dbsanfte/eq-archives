I have close to the same system.= ATI Radeon 8500, 1.1GHz cel , 1GB pc 133
mem,sb live, 30 Gb ibm ata 100 drive.
And had the same problem..
I went and bought a GF 4 440 eVGA .
Now I only have to turn down my video options in the bazaar..
All set to max in the rest of the world...But in heavy spell casting areas..
