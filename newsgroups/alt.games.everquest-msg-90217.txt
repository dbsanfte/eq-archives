I have a PIII 500mhz, 768ram, Nvidia Geforce3 TI 500, Win XP and all
the latest drivers, and a cable connection with a ping of 80 to 110
nearly all the time.  Even with that I can use none of the new
models or I get terrible frame rates in almost any area (haven't
checked them all but have tried 6 or more zones of different types
so figure it is universal for me).  I run no programs in the
backround and have tried turning off all the other eye-candy options
in game in hopes that I could use the new models (tired of my Ogres
butt-rash hehe).  Nothing has worked or helped even.  For the most
part I would rather just gotten the new items/spells/advancement and
not had the rest if it since I can't use the new models or go to
some of the new areas even, but that is a bit selfish since many
can.  I would likely miss the moon port thing now anyway. I use it
instead of Druids and Wizards whenever possible.
