I do this crap or a living, Sony/Verant tried to do too much because Dark
Age of Camelot is an example of the next generation of graphical muds, and
EQ can't compete. Wanna know why we REALLY have horses now? go look at DaoC,
and you'll know.  sony won't commit to a re-write of the game, and their
greed and short-sightedness are going to cost them dearly. I just had a
cleric GIVE me his entire kit of 200+wis gear on Nameless b/c he and all his
friends are leaving to play daoc. I went and checked it out. As soon as my
friend get's her  computer (she plays eq on a laptop), we're both going to
camelot.

check out the movies of actual gameplay on gamespot. Don't believe me,
believe your own eyes.
