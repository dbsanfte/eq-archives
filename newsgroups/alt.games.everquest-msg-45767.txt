This has a further attraction though with the VERY different ruleset.
Notice I don't say due to roleplaying, since the ruleset has nothing
to do with roleplaying. It is a set that is really going to attract an
optimizer/camper with lots of resources and friends who would also be
playing with him. 

Really, except for not being pvp, it is the most challenging ruleset
in EQ. So if you want a challenge, this is it. Its kind of like today
my guild was doing gorenaire and I thought how different it would be
for a guild on the Firiona server where even casters can only bind in
cities. Instead of having the casters bound nearby, especially clerics
with res sticks, they'd have to all hoof it back from firiona vie to
start CR. 

This will also be a great server for the xenophobic or a druid
character who does not want to be bugged by everyone. Instead of being
bugged by all your wood elf druid will only be bugged by those of its
alignment so it can go and take a break in the feeroot or something.
