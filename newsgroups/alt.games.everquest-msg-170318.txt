I'm working on a little "look-up" comparison program (for practicing my 
rusty programming skills).  I'd like to be able to select either race or 
class, and see a list of what the race can be or what races can be a 
certain class, complete with racial abilities, starting stats, bonus 
points, and the like.

However, I can't seem to find the racial abilities for the Vah Shir(sp?), 
or as I like to call 'em, the Kitty-Kats.  Any one help me?
