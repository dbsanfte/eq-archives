I played Hz for a couple of months, and it's true that the crafting 
system was very well done from a design and function standpoint. The only 
drawback I saw was that it seemed that at a certain point, taking the 
mason profession as an example, you were basically left making the same 
two things over and over and over with the only changes coming every so 
many levels (20?) when you had to use different, harder to find resources 
to make the same two items.

That, I could have lived with, considering the opportunity to participate 
in the world-wide reconstruction efforts. Unfortunately, I can't live by 
tradeskills alone, and the content available for the aspiring adventurer 
was shamefully underdone. There was no way I could envision myself 
hitting the upper levels on what was available.

I cancelled lamenting what truly could have been.
