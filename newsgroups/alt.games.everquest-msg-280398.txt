Yes.  Most people have said that you don't get any group or zone bonuses when
raiding, so you're losing quite a bit of XP.  It may be worth it anyway, for
the convenience and fun of raiding.

Nope, it sucks.  It can still add up, if you kill a lot, but it's less than
you'd get if you split into 6 person (or whatever) groups and take turns
getting the kill and xp, without a raid.

Chat channels make this fairly reasonable to do without making an actual raid.
Just move people around often if they're not getting their share of kills.
