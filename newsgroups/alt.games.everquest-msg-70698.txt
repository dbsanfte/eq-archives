But people who have spent that much time on EQ, upon finding that they
cannot play with Win95, could have cancelled their accounts at that time,
stopped paying.  When, or if, they do upgrade their OS, they could
reactivate, start paying again, and continue on their merry way.  Mind you,
I do think that VI made a big mistake with the way they went about this
expansion, they should have let people know far ahead of time, so that they
could prepare for it.  Better yet, they should have used DX8.0 rather than
8.1, I don't know what the issues were with that on their side, but I have
to assume that for some reason that was not a viable option in the end.
