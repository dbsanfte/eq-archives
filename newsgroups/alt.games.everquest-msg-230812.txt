	What happens is that the ratio of toughness to con level goes
way up, and the mobs develop annoying powers like.. complete heal! :-) 
(Boy I hate healers...)  You'll also have to heal more than the main
tank because everyone in the group will take _some_ damage from
_something_.  And you wont always be able to use your most efficient
heal: you'll need to use quicker heals to spread your attention around
or just to keep up with a hairy situation.
