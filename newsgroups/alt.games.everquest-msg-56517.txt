Well, with a solo-druid created just to play when
bored, I've had no trouble leveling up to 42 in
scarab armor and bone arms/legs.  I can't quadkite
27 red mobs in a row or anything, but I can
constantly handle any even-blue that comes my
way, and a single yellow if I'm FM.  Not the most
"efficient" way to play or level up, but I'll throw you
one monkey-wrench into your "balance" arguement.

How many rogues or warriors do you think could
take on a yellow-con critter wearing the same
scarab armor and weilding a Combine Scimitar?

My 39 Wizard is naked execept for a dragoon
dirk and T-Boots.  Equipment is lost on her, and
all of her earned coin after purchasing spells goes
back to my 2nd rogue, a class that NEEDS
equipment.

I don't think druids are screwed.  Fear kite a
voracious brute at level 38 when it's yellow
and you're naked on a Corpse Recovery, and
tell me if many other classes  wanna hear about
how nerfed druids are...
