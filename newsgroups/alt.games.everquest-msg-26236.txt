That seems to be a very popular combo, however, I would recommend, If you
have a decent 1HB skill, to get a Warclub of Ykesha rather than a SSoY, same
proc, only at level 40 rather than 37, and a slightly better dmg/delay (1
more dmg or 1 less delay, I can't remember)  and for some reason it tends to
be cheaper than a SSoY, at least on my server (I picked one up for 600pp,
saw one for 1.2k the next day though, heheh)
