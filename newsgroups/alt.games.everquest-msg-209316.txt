When do you send your pet in David?  I've read (in this group, don't
recall the poster or thread tho) that Druid roots are checked for
breaks on the first tick after landing and every 5 ticks thereafter.
This as opposed to "regular" roots which are checked every tick (and
all roots are checked when direct damage is taken from a spell).
This squares with my experiences playing a Druid, get past the first
tick and you've got time to quick fix your spell lineup.  Anyhow, if
you're sending your pet in right after rooting the mob it'll be
engaging right as the mob gets its first chance to break root.

I've landed tens of thousands of melee hits on thousands of rooted
mobs (or maybe that's hundreds of thousands of hits, it all blurs
together).  DD Spells (including DoTs, roots, and stuns with DD
components) break root, whether cast or proc'd.  I don't know if
rain-type spells will break root.  Ordinary melee damage, DoT
damage, DS damage, and archery damage do not break root.
