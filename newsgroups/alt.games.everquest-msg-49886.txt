Good advice.  I've run through the 40's in the dreadlands quickly on
different characters.

EVERYBODY is KOS to EVERYTHING in the dreadlands.  There are
no guards.  There are no special places. Every living creature in the zone
wants you dead, no matter what level, race, or class.  There is a
druid/wizard
teleport apiece in the dreadlands.  Fironia Vie is the next zone over, so
it's a
convienient place to be bound.
