Oh, great.  So take an already crowded zone and make it more so.  Then you
have to put up with that crap any time you want to travel using PoK.

I personally feel the bazaar is a good idea badly executed.  There should be
a bazaar in each town.  There should also be a group of NPC "brokers" at
each bazaar, representing other bazaars.  These brokers have access to
objects in any other zone (it's their special gift).  To get an item in
another town, you go to the broker for the city that has the item, pay the
broker fee (reasonably nominal), and wait for the time when the broker says
it will arrive (or perhaps, their other gift is to port the item
immediately, in which case, you pay the broker fee and the purchase price)
When it arrives, you pay for the item and it is transferred.  If you don't
buy it, then it goes into the broker's inventory and is sold like any other
NPC object.

Of course, you probably wouldn't find a representative of Neriak in
Freetown.  Faction would have an impact on availability, but that's just
realistic.  Such a system would spread the players across all the areas, so
that no area would be burdened with a hugh bazaar that doesn't work worth
beans, nor would you find players playing only in areas near the bazaar.  I
suspect this is one reason Paludal is so crowded (but only one).

Considering that most of the elements of the bazaar are already in place,
this really wouldn't be that hard to implement.  As far as the capabilities
of the Brokers is concerned, it's no more far fetched than the PoK
pedestals.

Cheers,
Eric
