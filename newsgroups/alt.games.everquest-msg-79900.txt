Subject: Good weapon for a level 17 Necro?

My level 17 Necro (human, if it matters) is currently using a Staff of
Writhing. Unfortunately, it won't proc until level 45 or so, and by then I
either won't need to melee, or will have a much better weapon.

Can anyone recommend a good Piercing or 1-Handed Blunt weapon that I could use
instead, that doesn't cost a fortune? (Around 200pp or less)
