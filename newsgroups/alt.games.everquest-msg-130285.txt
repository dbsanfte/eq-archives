Why would it?

How are you defining 'game'?

Are you suggesting that everyone, or anyone, that
has reached level 60, and is equipped with the
uberest items, no longer has a 'game' to play?

I may as well argue that the tedium of early
levels is not a 'game', but a chore.

Some people enjoy the levelling aspect of a game
like EQ. Some like to work through low levels and
make their way to the top, purely from playing the
game, and taking pleasure from the journey.

Others find that aspect extremely dull.

That doesn't make it less of a 'game' for them. It
will always be a game as long as they enjoy what
they are doing.

Besides that, it doesn't necessarily have to be
all or nothing. You wouldn't necessarily have to
be able to buy every single item, or pay your way
to very highest level. Perhaps there would be
items, or levels, or zones inaccessible by cash
alone.

What if EQ offered such a thing as a 'starter
pack', that made you level 10 in the class and
race you chose, gave you a few hundred plat, and
equipped you with items that would last until the
20's. 

With a "thin end of the wedge" approach like this,
how many players would complain?

It would certainly cut e-bayers out of the loop,
and divert their ill-gotten gains into Sony
coffers.

It is this last point, (ie financial gain), that I
see as a reason for the inevitability of
customised accounts.

Why cater to the lowest common denominator,
(financially speaking), when you can cater to much
higher levels of disposable income?
