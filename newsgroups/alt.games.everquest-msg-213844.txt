    It would depend on gear, obviously. But the gear that NToV was conquered
in is considered junk today. Your main tank will be dressed in droppable
items that far surpass what the original people heading there had. So if the
group is competent, and well-geared, then yes, it will be trivial.

    Most of the dragons are one-groupable by Time-level players, or even
Elemental-level players. Most of the drops are poo, but some of them are
droppable and sell for a fair amount, and some of them (Blackstar) still
compare well to more modern gear.

    The 'lings are charmable. I know this from personal experience, as one
day when we really sucked we nearly died to Aary before a charmed 'ling
tanked and killed him. Turn that liability into an asset!

    Unless everything repops on you, there's still places you can CR. Just
have to be quick about it. This is also from personal experience, same raid!

    Solution: don't play like a chump. If you know your raid is fragile, put
in place processes to ensure you don't get pounded into a coffin CR.
