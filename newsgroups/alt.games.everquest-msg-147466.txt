Are you still here? I thought you had some flags to tattoo to your ass
or something.

You quit because Verant didn't do enough to please your overinflated
sense of outrage, remember (as if the network coverage wasn't stagnant
and cloying enough)? Move on. Get lost.

P.S. calling people who disagree with you worthless or children isn't
the height of intellectual superiority either, dipshit. Your military
service obviously didn't teach you much. What a waste.
