Several people have adressed this.   In a case where the account information
was changed, the name on the original credit card is the account owner.   Any
transfer of it would have been selling the account.

No, they have no way of knowing for absolute sure whether you actually sold
it.   They also have no way of knowing if you were hacked.

The position Verant is taking now though is that you are guilty...   Actually
I was about to write "Guilty until proven innocent" but under the current
policy, even if you did find a way to prove yourself innocent, you would still
be banned.   So Verant's current position is that you are guilty no matter
what.   Not Innocent until proven guilty...  which is a legal theory you may
have heard of before. ;)

Now granted, Verant doesn't have to follow a theory of innocent until proven
gulty...  that much is obvious, since they are now not going to do it.   But
it's just a stupid and clueless method of dealing with your customers thats
guarenteed to screw over some good people.
