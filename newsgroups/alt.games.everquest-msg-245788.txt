I agree.

My gaming clan formed a PA, and it helped somewhat, usually having people 
to play with, but what was there to do?

You got it. I want to be able to get and choose between many different 
types of gear and it would be even better yet if they each offered 
something different.

This is EQ's biggest draw, IMO. You compare a group of six players who 
just get together and all pounce on the mobs without rhyme or reason with 
the same group of six classes who know how to get the most out of their 
class and a group in general and the difference is usually astounding. 

SWG pretty much just made it a slugfest. Everyone just opened fire and 
hoped the enemy died first. They give you some variety in class 
abilities, but they don't make it necessary at all to play to the 
specific strengths of your class in combat.
