While I understand your reasoning, I do not agree with you.  I gave up messing with the
default application installation paths a long time ago.  Maintenance, and removal, of
applications becomes much more reliable.  I let things go where they want to, with very
few exceptions.

I do things differently in the Windows Server environment, but we're talking about an XP
workstation here.  One managed by a gent who is rumored to be technically savvy with
regards to XP workstations, but did not know how to format a 2nd disk for use with the OS.
Quite a contradiction IMO.  I suggest keeping things as simple as possible to lessen his
support overhead.

I absolutely agree with you here, in principle at least.  Fortunately, most modern apps
write their data to My Documents, which can be redirected to any folder of your choosing
through several different methods of varying complexity.  One of the simplest ways, IMO,
is to use Microsoft's TweakUI PowerToy v2.10.00.  Expand the My Computer>Special Folders
tree and have at it.

I usually do this through a combination of Group Policy and user logon script because it
allows a more granular focus.  However, I do not save to a separate physical disk or
partition (but I do not have a problem with your suggestion to do so).  I subst a drive to
the user's traditional c:\My Documents\[username]\My Documents folder, then redirect My
Documents, Favorites, Cookies and Document Templates into subfolders of the substed drive.
This makes it very easy for the user to browse their data, as it is on a separate drive
letter (such as U: for user, or L: for Lenny).  It also makes it very easy for the user to
back up 99% of their data.  The Outlook signatures and other stuff in the Application Data
folder can be backed up, too, but that stuff is typically of less importance and not as
large a concern.

Finally, there are many fine "user DNA" capture-and-restore tools available to the end
user.  Any of these tools will backup all of the user profiles and data on one
workstation.  They'll capture configurations, data and documents from the dankest corners
of a hard disk, and restore it to a second workstation, with repeatable, successful
results.

Best regards,

Tim ==
