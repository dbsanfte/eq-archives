To release a sequel to a game with such a high subscriber base would be
rather a lame duck. Take a look at Ultima online 2, scrapped! It is far more
sensible for them to invest a fraction of the time and money on continuously
updating what they have. If its not broke, dont fix it. Take a look at the
graphics in ultima online. The gameboy advance could run better graphics
than that but UO still maintains a huge subscribership. What UO lacks is
major updates to the engine and gameplay that verant gives us.

I am fairly certain that the expansion will apply new graphics to the whole
game not just one realm. People who dont have the expansion see everything
with the older graphics.

My 2 cents
