Everytime these bunnies are discussed I can't help but think of the obvious
Holy Grail, and of Jimmy Carter, and the bunny incident, which BTW, Tom
Paxton put to song.

I don't want a bunny wunny in my wittle wow boat
in my wittle wow boat in da pond
for do bunny might be cwazy
and he bite me in da throat
in my wittle wow boat in da pond.

That's the chorus, as near as I can recollect.
