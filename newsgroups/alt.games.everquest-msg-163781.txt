Dalnir would be decent for a group thats size and level I think...but only
the entrancey areas. Im soloing there at 34 ranger.

Giant fort might be a bit light on xp for a full group but a duo of those
levels should do nicely.

Runnyeye is a good option I think, as would Paw Spires and possibly Paw
itself.
