I just purchased EQ Trilogy and SoL on Amazon and am awaiting arrival.
 My only other MMORPG experience has been two months playing AC2.  And
I've completed the main quest of the single-player Morrowind.  I've
enjoyed both of these and thought I'd see what EQ was all about.  Any
advice?  Should I install all the packs immediately or wait until I've
leveled up a bit?
