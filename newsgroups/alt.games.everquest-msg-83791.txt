Bah. Try to keep your sense of humor. We were being quite cordial
in-game (or at least I thought.) As to talking about it in game and not
on a news group, first of all you caught me in the middle of a camp down
below Chef in Seb. Not a raid, but a busy little group none the less. As
MA I get a lot of battle spam (can't turn off your own hits messages)
and it was back to back. Sorry I couldn't chat at the time. Besides,
this is an on-topic question that could be of value to other clerics and
tanks. As long as it doesn't degenerate into a completely useless "yer
mom's a crack whore" conversation, it's not out of line for this forum.

Two separate, but related, issues which I can't seem to get you to
differentiate between. The whole conversation started (before the
addition of /discs to it came up) when you stated that, disc or no disc,
you didn't let your MA's go down to beserker stage. Ever. And you
explained why. (sort of.) I, and a lot of other people up to and
including Warlords and High Priests I know, disagree with you on that
philosophy. 

Next, we can add in the /disc thing. And yes, more damage faster leads
to more taunt. Can a tank be MA and taunt effectively without using a
disc? Sure! And since it's a *SITUATIONAL* thing, there are tons of
times when they would pass on the /disc and just taunt normally.
However, we're dealing with some oddball cases here. One is level 54
champions who don't even have defensive. Other cases could be 55+
warriors, but fighting in an area where they are NOT going to be facing
some god awful ubermob where /disc defensive is the ONLY way to keep
them alive until the CHeal chain can start. If these warriors want to go
low to get some crips, etc. and possibly even throw in a /disc for an
"impressive" damage splurt, then there's a time and a place where that's
not only not harmful, but it's helpful. I don't know how else to try to
get that through to you. I know it hurts your feelings to see any tanks
enjoy themselves, but this is just how it is.
*sigh*

Ok. I said it. I repeated it. Sounds exactly like what I said from the
beginning. "Need" is not the same as "improves".  But let's see what you
ahve to say about the damage output and taunt:

Good. Glad to see we're making progress and on the same page at least
for this much of it. :-)

Again, you don't "need" even the non /dics crips. But they help. They
provide "more damage" when they happen. (See your comment above.) Oh,
and for what it's worth, hang in there with your warrior. In another
five to ten levels they'll come a lot more often. Seem to for me anyway.
I get, on average, at least one crip every time I go low. I had a TON in
DN yesterday, and yes I was low a LOT. (Not all intentional either... he
he.)

My apologies for whatever I wrote that you managed to pick that out of.
Still not cleared up, but for the record I'm not *quite* stupid or
arrogant enough to ever imply that my lowbie, non-uber-guilded champion
has the game experience of any sixty player. You can smooth the hackles
down now.

You're awfully defensive. I was drawing a comparison between two
*extremes* not putting your grouping tendencies on the same level as a
pure soloist loner. I'm just saying they *all* have the right to pick
how they play, providing they're not intentionally griefing anyone else.
We all pay our ten bucks, so we all pick how we want to play. You hate
guilds. You've explained why. Your reasons are valid, and wouldn't need
to be if they weren't. Not everyone likes raiding. Hell, Tiru hates it.
But she does it because I'll die otherwise. :-)

Sadly, what you are describing is extremely typical. I have railed
against the idea of any sort of "raid point" system forever. I think it
sucks, and encourages just the sort of idiocy that you describe above.
But guess what? Our guild is already in the midst of a discussion to
implement a point system, and they're slowing talking me into grudgingly
supporting it when it happens. Such systems can lead to the horrible
crap you describe. But a *lack* of such a system can cause even more
problems. I don't know how anybody ever solves that issue, if they ever
do.

Ok. That one sounds totally insane, and would require more of a
"benevolent despot" type of thing. And the guild leader/raid leader
(despot) in question better be really damned smart, fair minded,
attentive, etc. or it will fall apart.

Wow! That would suck! I can see how you got such a bad taste in your
mouth for guilds. I'd quit a guild like that too.

No, but it would be pretty funny. I'd have to get a screen shot of the

Agree completely. I keep learning every day that the game changes more
and more (for raids anyway) the higher you try to go. Certain classes do
get marginalized, and that sucks. We are still lowbie enough that we can
take all of our people of all classes on raids and make them all very
useful. But we're only running an average level of 53 to 55 for the most
part. Yes, I understand that will change later, and I'm not looking
forward to it. Clerics and Warriors will always have a place, but we
have a bunch of great druids in our guild who I like and respect a lot.
I'd hate to see them feel marginalized out of raiding. (Druids only
being one example, of course.)

Nope and nope. I'll still stand by that one. It all depends, as you
said, on what you want to get out of the game. If you think, as I do,
that getting to the very biggest, high end stuff in the game is a valid
group goal, and you were somebody grouped with me a lot, I'd say you're
not a team player. That doesn't make you wrong. You just play
differently. You pay your ten bucks, so that's what's right for you.
Just wouldn't want anyone with that attitude in our guild, is all I'm
saying.

> Let's go each point, one by one:

Dear God, this is going to get long. ;-) so I'll just snip your reasons.
I agree with all of them.... *FOR YOU*. So that defines your play style.
No problem there. Enjoy.

Yep. We have already started bumping heads with Harmonium on a couple
occasions. (Though it's only with their low level members, primarily
alts that they are leveling up to sixty in some of the same zones we
hunt in.) Thus far it's still very friendly. Hell, one of their warlords
came over to lend a hand and MA'd on Ixiblat for us this weekend. But
yes, the day will likely come when what you say will come to pass. I'm
not saying I'm looking forward to it either, but I accept it as part of
the game, and we'll just have to deal.

>     Cleric nukes are bad for stopping runners.

Situational. Yes, bad especially for frogs. Not too shabby on Hole
elementals though. And it's always preceeded with a stun. By the time
the mob has been stunned and then nuked, we've either beaten it to death
or it has no points left to move very far.

Nope. You've chosen to miss the point here, and I really can't think of
any way to get you to not choose to do so. I'll just say it again. It's
*situational*. Sorry you don't get that. Time and a place for
everything. And it's never *needed* to hold aggro. But when available,
it can help out, even if only on that one mob every however often.
Especially when the tank is not 55 yet and has no defensive /disc to be
holding in reserve. But even post 55 tanks will sometimes grind in areas
where there's just not going to be a need for defensive.

And again, I'll say I think you got a shitty deal coming up, and it's
soured your attitude. Tiru's not the only cleric in our raid that get's
to "fool around". The only time she and Melle (the other highest level
cleric we have with us regularly) are forced into the "sit on your ass
and do your job" mode is on big, single target mobs, or really intense
constant pulling situations where we are testing our limits. (example
being the PoZ's in the arena, plus all the normal adds, with less than
four groups.) Then it's really just buckle down, everyone do your job,
or die.

You've got me on that one, and I can only hang my head in shame. I
reacted too fast, frankly in a bit of a panic, and hit the wrong one. I
was trying to secure aggro fast on a mob that I had not been MA on until
the MA died. Had I been thinking clearly, I'd have hit charge. I blew
it. In the long run, however, it wouldn't have made a lick of
difference, as I wound up holding aggro till I died anyway, but still,
I'd like to perform my job as well as possible. (I think it was James
Tiberius Kirk who once said, "Surely how we die is nearly as important
as how we live?" or something like that.)

You would. But your way still doesn't sound "better", again depending on

No... *you* showed that to yourself, but that wasn't required since you
