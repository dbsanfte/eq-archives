Agreed!  I do too *in a group of regulars*.  I know how they pull, I know how
we all play together, and have found HOT is usually all I need with them.  Toss
a couple little heals on my chanter once in a while, we roll right along.

The problem with this, in a group of strangers, where mana CAN be a big
concern, is agro management.  If the MT is at 60 when the mob comes in, and
he's at 40 when the mobs still at 80, that CH can get cleric agro real quick. 
(I always want to scream *do you know how to TAUNT?????*  But I don't.)   Now
the cleric has to heal *himself* too.  Or, to avoid this, you don't sit down. 
No sit = no med.   I won't even mention *adds*.
IMO this is one of those *experience / judgement / depends on the group* calls.
 (I rarely cast CH and *usually* I have plenty of mana for Karn, stuns, Vie,
and even a few nukes).
Then of course you have the MTs that require TWO complete heals every mob.  I'm
not going to go there.
