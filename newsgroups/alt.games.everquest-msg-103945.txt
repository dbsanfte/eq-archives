All laws come about because two conditions exist:

(1) Lawyers trying to make a buck;
(2) "Once upon a tame there was a moron who <fill in the blank>".

How to fix the situation: 

(1) Follow Shakespeare's lead when he said "First thing we do,..." (2
Henry VI)
(2) Bitch-slap the mom for not protecting her son better; and dig up
her son and slap him too for being a loser and not knowing that
epilepsy and certain screen refresh rates do not mix. Didn't anyone
learn from those Japanese kids and the problems that happend from
Pokemon? Jeez.
(3) Inform the world to get a life...EQ is just a game, for Christ's
sake.

Do have any pity? Not really. Follow Shakespeare's lead again, but
this time, take from Richard III: "No beast so fierce but knows some
touch of pity.
But I know none, And therefore am no beast."
