As a human necro in qeynos i made some pp by draging peoples corpse
out from the guild area, spectres and the rotting sentry cuts down
most people rather quick, i used to pull the corpses to the zone under
the arena but i think some moron managed to lure one of the guards
there, so now that place i very unsafe :(
