Surely you jest!  Didn't you know that Druids are hard to level?
You dare to suggest that you can xp and have fun at the same time!?
You get that nose plastered back against your grindstone this instant
young man!  Minimize your maximums!  Maximize your minimums!  Train
those n00bs out of the zone before they mess up your quad.  And when
you've pharmed enough lewt make yourself a real character on your
second account and PL him to 50, then start bitching about how hard
it was to level your Druid.  Sheesh, some people...
