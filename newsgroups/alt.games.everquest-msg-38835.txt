None, but that isn't the issue. The issue is that the last expansion
catered to level 35+ players and nobody bitched. Now that Verant is
making an expansion that caters to lower level players, everyone over
level 35 is crying like a baby. I mean, how much fucking more do high
level players need? There are obscene amounts of places to fight when
you're level 35+. Velious covered the level 35+ segment of the
population pretty well. Luclin is going to cover everyone else and
still have high level content. That's more than can be said of
Velious.

I do think TCC is a bad idea. I've always thought it was a bad idea. I
don't see farming as much of a problem now. Experience is more
important than platinum in EverQuest at higher levels. The good
players will be fighting whatever gives them experience rather than
wasting their time on greens. TCC code is a good idea, in theory, but
you can't implement something like that into a 2+ year old game that
already has an established economy. It doesn't make sense, unless you
want to encourage high level players to start over, thus keeping their
accounts open and your wallet fat. Now what we'll see is low level
players being powerleveled by their guild so the guild can collect the
TCC-protected items. As usual, huge guilds are going to win.
