I don't think anyone was disputing that Freebringer is useful.  One of the
most useful epics, even.

What they are saying is that compared to almost every other epic in terms of
difficulty and effort required to obtain it...  it appears to be "Ding 51!
....  Congrats, heres your epic!"

Shaman and druid epics are likewise almost obscenly easy, but thier rewards
aren't really as useful.
