I wouldn't advise putting the points into smithing, because it's very easy
to get to
23 in smithing without that - sharpen rusty weapons!  You get them off those
wimpy
decaying skeletons, stick 'em in the forge with a sharpening stone, and
skill up that way.
Often you can buy rusty weapons from vendors which are near the newbie
areas, sharpen
them and then sell them back for a small profit (minus the cost of the
sharpening stones, which
are about 6 copper each).


The higher your intelligence or wisdom and to some degree your strength, you
will increase
your skill more rapidly as you sharpen the weapons.   My wife's wizzard, who
has an INT
of around 120 got to level 23 by sharpening about 40 weapons.  The only cost
involved is buying
the sharpening stones (which aren't availble everywhere).  Once you sharpen
the weapon,
it's usually worth a little more money when you sell it to a merchant.  It's
also a nice way
to make friends of lowbies... sharpening their rusty weapons will increase
the attack speed
of the weapon by 2 (e.g. drops from 44 to 42).  If the sharpening stones
aren't available from
a convenient place (say you are based in Kelethin, but have to go to
Steamfont to buy them)
buy about 100 of them to begin with.  So you may need more bags to carry
them home.

You can get to skill level 21 easily in tailoring by going killing tons of
wolves in Kelethin
or wolves and black bears in EC... you use the ruined pelts, plus a pattern
to make tattered
leather armor to level 26.  Or you can kill tons of spiderlings in EC to
make threads to level 21.
The latter has the attraction that you don't need a pattern, but spiderlings
don't drop that
much silk.
