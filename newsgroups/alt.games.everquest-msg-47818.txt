Don't bother. By the time you get Nature Walkers Scimitar, it will be an 
uber stat buff that just happens to be a 1hs.

Velium morningstar is wonderful.

Your role in your group is very flexible. You are the healer. If there is 
another/better healer, you are the buffer and tank DSer. If there is a 
better buffer (shaman) you are an offensive caster.

As for mana, it is not your groups job to med for you- med  for yourself. 
ESPECIALLY if you are the prime healer, consider yourself pretty much OOM 
when you hit 40 mana.

Well, if tailoring is something you have your heart set on, pump them into 
that until it is full.

Conjuration should raise on its own, after 14(summon food, summon drink, 
and conj based DoT), but until then I would spend a few bars of mana 
casting Dance of the Fireflies.

Well, I leveled my now-25 druid in Crushbone... Great XP, rarely problems 
finding a group, and good exp up to 15 or so, which is when I made the trek 
to Oasis. I leveled to about 17-18 there, then cruised over to North 
Karanas for some sweet griffawn lovings. :)
