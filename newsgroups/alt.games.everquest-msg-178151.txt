Unless this was just changed you have that backwards.  You see the
items most recently put up for sale, not the ones that've been there
longest.  This used to mean it was useful to occasionally take your
trader out and back into trader mode, thus making your goods the
"freshest", but there are times htis would be unwise on many/most/all
of the older servers because the bazaar is full and somebody else
might slip into your spot.  Oh, and IIRC the list length is limited
to 100 lines/items.
