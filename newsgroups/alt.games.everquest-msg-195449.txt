One reason 'twinking' is frown on by experienced players is the temptation
to advance too fast.

It is great to kill with one swipe of the sword, but 1hs skill (also
defense, offense, etc. etc.) depend on spending a certain amount of time
hitting (or being hit).  You should always try to max or almost max all your
skills for your current level before you go on to the next level.

It would be frustrating to you (and dangerous to those you group with) to
reach the appropriate level for your equipment, say level 40, and still have
only level 15 skills.
