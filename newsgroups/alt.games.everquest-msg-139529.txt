How interesting.  -Here- you say my evidence is valid, at least as it 
pertains to your own behaviour...

Whereas -here- you say that the very same evidence is wrong.  Now, if you 
want to -show- that it is wrong, you'll have to find one example of Lesa 
or BS posting in a manner insulting to you in a forum you would see it in, 
prior to 17 Jul 2002 04:01:01 GMT.  But then you'd have to actually 
provide evidence of something, so we all know it won't happen. And 
that's assuming such evidence even exists, which I very much doubt, since 
they never once posted to the forum you favor prior to that time.  I 
swear, for someone who was a cop for 7 years, you show a remarkable lack 
of knowledge of what evidence is.
