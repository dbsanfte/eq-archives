Yup we do.....necros have Breath of the Dead as well, but I dont know if
that is a self only or targettable spell off hand. Rebreathers are another
option...thats a tinkered item, but they are very expensive to make and
the bazaar prices reflect that.

There are a number of items with Enduring Breath on them and a search
through allakhazam should show some of them up.
