Assuming that all servers had the same reward, it was:

	The Prime Healer's Bulwark
	MAGIC ITEM  ARTIFACT  NO DROP
	Slot: CHEST
	AC: 45
	STR:+25  STA:+45  HP:+125 SV DISEASE: +25
	SV POISON: +25
	Effect: Prime Healers Blessing
	WT: 0.1  Size: MEDIUM
	Class: ALL
	Race: ALL

The effect is HP regen of 250(L1)-750(L20) HP over 50 ticks.  The
level 14 druid twink who got it on my server says he's also seeing
fast mana regen, although mana regen is not listed in the spell data
file.
