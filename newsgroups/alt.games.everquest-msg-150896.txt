Heh. I go to nightclubs all the time on my own and wander around getting
drunk with a genuine smile on my face. I don't need other peoples company to
unwind and have a bit of fun. When I want to meet people I have no problem
with that either - I just stop, still smiling and talk to them.

Being non-aggressive, non-demanding, non-predatory and pleasant with a big
genuine smile on your face is the best pick up line availiable. Even a
drunken fat lunatic like myself has no problems...
