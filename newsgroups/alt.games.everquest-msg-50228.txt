    Ok, so tell me: what challenge is there in doing them? Sounds like the
challenge is, "Accumulate cash." Read the EQTraders boards to get an idea
what other tradeskillers think about Jewelcrafting, which works very much
like DAoC tradeskills.

    Now that sounds pretty cool. 8)

    Very little cash lost now that combinable containers don't eat things -
you keep all ingredients after an attempt at anything that doesn't exist.
Things that "supposedly exist but don't" are PLAYER driven - VI never said
"there's a Fleeting Quiver out there, go get it!" Yes, having the pattern
was a stupid thing, but it was a player's choice to pursue the matter. And
pursuing the matter led to not only the Root Beer Float being discovered,
but also recently Eggnog and Eggnog XXX (I imagine you meant Eggnog instead
of the Root Beer Float). It took players ten months to figure out what the
recipe for Eggnog was, more given that Yak's hint was given before last
Xmas - can you see any PvE challenges taking that long to solve in DAoC?

    Yes, exactly. Now look at DAoC, the brand-new game where ALL the quests
are new to everyone. Any challenge to figure these new quests out? No, that
would be frustrating to the player! The fact that there's EQ spoiler sites
is a testament to how engaging and vast the EQ world is. It still amazes me
that there's old-world quests still undiscovered.

>Everyone after that just goes to a web site and looks up the particulars,

    If not for people who felt challenged enough to attempt these quests,
there wouldn't be spoiler sites as there'd be no spoilers.

    This is about as realistic as a game where things respawn can get,
though. Gynok is going to have a magic gold ring whether you know what that
gold ring is for or not. And again, these things engage players - if I find
some Lore, No Drop item on D'Vinn in Crushbone, I get curious and ask folks
about it, or look it up on Allakhazam's. And if it's an undiscovered quest,
then I get curious and start asking NPCs about it. It makes me interested.

>or farming quest components (the
>heads for the Red Headband come to mind) for sale.

    That's something that some players aren't too fond of, given the
questions about ending multiquesting. That a quest can have farmed
components points to a weakness in the quest, not the game - they have No
Drop and combinable containers, so there's no excuses.

EQ.

    So the mere existence of spoiler sites in a game as old as EQ means the
quests are MORE cookie-cutter? When Luclin comes out, will those quests be
easy, "look it up" quests, or will SOMEBODY have to figure it out? Compare
with DAoC - "the log says go here, do this".

    Which is a weakness. In EQ there's many characters that are KOS in their
home cities due to choices they've made about what to kill. Some players
have also overcome "normal" racial hatreds and become accepted in areas,
like Dan Day's dwarf paladin in Neriak and Cabilis. That's a wider latitude
for character development. Heck, they can even base expansions off faction,
as they did in Velious and as they will be doing in Luclin.

    I guess what I'm getting at is this: DAoC seems like a very simplified
version of EQ, at least at first glance. Anything that could have caused
frustration in EQ - losing a level, having to figure out a quest, gathering
tradeskill components, doing a corpse retrieval - has been eliminated or
reduced sharply in severity in DAoC. And I'm not so sure that such a level
of "dumbing down" is good for a game that wants to appeal to gamers. You can
tell that a LOT of thought has gone into DAoC, and things have been
carefully considered - the major-bug-free launch alone was a tremendous MMOG
achievement. I'm just not sure this "dumbing down" was a wise choice.
