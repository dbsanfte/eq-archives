as per journal entry number seven of Al'Kabor (www.everquest.com) we can
deduce with increasing amounts of cetainty that the mode of travel to luclin
will most likely be teleports. The argument that you can't bloody well walk
to the moon, also speaks in favour of this. Latter comment not negating the
possibility of a moonship ( moonshuttle al'kabor launch delayed due to bad
weather at Erudin spacecentre) though no information is available confirming
or denying this as a possibility.

Furthermore, the mode of teleportation is likely to be boatlike in origin.
Anyone can hitch a ride. The spires located around the new and old world are
likely to be used in this fashion, though I doubt that all spires will lead
to luclin. Likely one or two spires will; and most likely somewhere on the
now hugely under used continent of Odus where, afterall, the whole business
with Luclin started in the first place. Not forgetting that Al'Kabor is from
Erudin.

A further look at the journal suggests there is some item to be used to make
the portal 'go'. This indicates some rather cunning thinking on the part of
the developers as and activation methode ensures no one walks in to the
portal accidentally and be wisked off to new and dangerous places. Should
all spires lead to Luclin, than that item will be somewhat hard to come by
and mostlikely be found, looted, quested or bought in the above mentioned
city on the above mentioned continent. If only one spire leads to luclin,
than this would be a rather pointless enterprice as you will be there
anyway, in which case pressing a button or simply walking in might set it
off. A wizard NPC teleporting to Luclin from various locations is also a
possibility. Money might be envolved.

And wizards get to port and gate there, obviously. Druids too, propably.

Other than this, one can but speculate really.
