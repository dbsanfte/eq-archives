Hello group,

I will use a poorly equiped lvl 60 mage to hunt some gears to twink an
SK, just wondering where  to start.  I have Kunark, Velious, LoY, but
not SoL and PoP . There is no flee market on the server I'm playing on
and I have little pp, So buying from others players are not a choice.
At the moment I'm thinking go to CC to get some Ry`gorr armor and a
Messager of Queen, any other ideas?
I only some need average gears, but I would like the camp to be short
with certain drops.

Any help very much appreciated.
