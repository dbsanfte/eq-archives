I really hate to get drawn into this, but I'm a sucker I guess.
First off : I agree that this is an awful event, a total tragedy and
that justic must be done. I do not want peopel to think that I don't
care. I do. And I am scared and worried for the future. This is not an
attack on America nore a justification of the unforgivable acts that
have taken place.

Don't you think that there is a posibility that this type of attitued is
exactly why America has been targeted ?
There are a lot of people in other countries who see what America does
"FOR" the world as interferance, self interest, profitteering (SP) and
in some cases acts of war.

With communication and travel as there are in the modern world everyone
has to care what happens somewhere else to some degree. Should I not
care about you because I am in the UK?

Why shouldn't it happen in the US ?
I know that there has been very little terrorist activity in the US
previously, but why consider yourself immune to it ?
The US foren office has fingers in so many pies that there is probably
some group with a grevence in every country in the world. I think that a
terrorist act of this nature was almost inevitable.

As I said before it is a small world and every action has knock on
effects.
You are happy for you TAX dollers to pay for an Army, but not
preventitive measures ?
Are you also happy never to brush your teeth and only pay for dentures ?

> I could care less about the "Protection Of The World". 

Unfortunatly with great power comes great responsibility.
The USA is by it's own reconing the most powerful country in the world.
It has to accept the responsibilitys that go with that power.
It also has to accept the risks.

Err, Yes you do. Or at least I do.

> Why? 

Because the American media is notoriously egocentric and focuses far
more on internal matters than on global issues.
Because the west in general (I include Europe here) does not understand
the issues involved in the middle east.

Well in my humble oppinion, perhaps you should care.
It seems that people in those places care about what America does.

I feel for your loss. I am very sorry for you. This is a tragedy and the
perpertrators must be brought to justice. You are in my thoughts and the
thoughts of people all over the world.

Until we have any idea of who is responsible there can be no real
discussion of what to do now. Action is required, but calculated action.

I hope that those responsible are brought to justice, but the causes of
their hate will also need to be treated and I for one do not believe
that genocide is a moral option. Thus the USA will need to review it's
forren policy and it's general attitude to the rest of the world.

I hope that I have not offended anyone.
