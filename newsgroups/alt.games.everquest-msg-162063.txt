Yeah, you must be right.  Who needs damage shields, or Harmony,
or Snare, or the ability to port away from wherever you're at

to name just a few of the things a Druid can do that a Shaman
cannot.

Next time try being less ignorant, about the subject and about
newsgroup ettiquete, top posting is irritating and lazy.
