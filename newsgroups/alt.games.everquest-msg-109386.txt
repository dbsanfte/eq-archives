Only if you have no moral center and redefine terms like 'good' and
'evil' at whim.

Regardless of what 'they' call their actions it does not change the fact
that the actions are evil by definition. Unless you change the definition
of evil. But if you do that then any rational discussion is out the window
because 'all' terms are then subject to redefinition at whim.

Given this definition of evil:

Evil:
Anything which impairs the happiness of a being or deprives a
being of any good; anything which causes suffering of any kind
to sentient beings; injury; mischief; harm

Which I think most beings would agree with.

Then if action 'A' performed by person #1 against person #2 is evil.
Then action 'A' performed by person #2 against person #1 is also evil.
Regardless of the 'feelings' or 'thoughts' of persons '#1' or '#2'

If I redefine blue as red it does not change the underlying color, the
only thing that has changed is my name for the color.
