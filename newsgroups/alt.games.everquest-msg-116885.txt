Ok. I've got confirmation that this is a bug, and one that isn't
consistent at that. Two of my guildmates are roomies IRL, play on two
computers next to each other, etc. Apparently on Monday night they were
playing far past normal bedtime and got wiped out in LGuk. No clerics in
zone, and almost nobody from the guild was online. They decided to camp
out and come back yesterday morning to try again. They both used /camp
desktop. (Yes, I asked, remembering this thread going on.) They both
went to bed, so were not on another character, another account, at
server select or character select screen, etc.

Logged in yesterday morning and one of our lvl 52 clerics was online.
Went down to LGuk to rez the poor bastards. One corpse still had more
than two hours on the rez timer and got their rez. The other corpse was
"This corpse is to old to be revived" or whatever that message is that
you get.

The loser in this lottery didn't try petitioning and just ate it, so I
don't know what the GM would have said.
