Evil was a big inconvenience.

Erudite evil was a pain, (pre luclin/pop) They couldn't even go through 
erudin safely to catch the boat to qeynos (another KOS city) without 
first getting an invis. And other than a port that was the only way off 
the continent...

And there was virtually nowhere they could go to sell and bind without 
some serious faction work.

Similiarly with Iksar, pre-luclin/pop... being cut out of old world 
cities was practically all of the cities, unless you wanted to take a 
boat back to Kunark.

Trolls and Ogres too.

In general Melees had it the worst, because they were seriously 
restricted in where they could bind. It was often a long trip back to 
your corpse/group.
