Hehe, reminds me of a guy that got kicked out of my school after being a bother for
1ï¿½ year, being the big Linux wiseguy, but strangely flunking every technical exam,
then the idiot tried to hack his workplace from the school (even did it at
nighttime where you can only get it using ID cards, so he couldnt lie about not
being there), and both got fired and kicked from the school. Am still sad that
noone files a criminal charget at him.
