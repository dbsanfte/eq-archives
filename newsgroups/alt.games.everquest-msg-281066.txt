I wonder that too,why SOE wants to force player to become level 70.
Being 67 is aleady bad enough,lots of mobs in older content going 
light blue or give noticable less xp than at 65.
Dont get me started on the "required level 70" crap on items
,especially in DoN,most of the gear I have on my 2 mains is better and
not required level 70.
