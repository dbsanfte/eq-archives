Hi all. A few months ago I did a very bad thing(tm). I deleted my level 31
Wizard. He was a good wizard, never hurt anyone, always did what he was
told, blasted the shit out of everything and anything....

I deleted him because I wanted to quit EQ, and if he was still around, I
would come back. Well, I came back anyway. I have a level 17 Necro levling
at the moment, but I would like my Wiz back. I petitioned, and the guide
said he would forward it to the server GM, who would contact me in game.
That was 4 days ago, no contact yet, and I've been on A LOT.

My server is Fennin Ro. When do these server gms come on, and what is the
likelyhood that he/she will bring my wizard back from the depths of the
underworld?

Thanks
Cursim the dead Wizard
