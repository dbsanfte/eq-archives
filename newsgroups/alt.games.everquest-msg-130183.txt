First off, let me say bummer, dude. Hope it worked out for ya.

Secondly, as often as I have heard about someone camping something
forever only to have it stolen, it doesn't surprise me that you may
get this reaction. I don't see any reason they should blow smoke up
your butt though. What's wrong with, "Sorry, I don't want to leave
this camp for *any* length of time. Wish I could help."

Aside from that I can't say they are any more wrong for not binding
someone - especially in another zone - than you are for expecting them
to drop everything and do so. Besides, you did kind of put yourself in
a bit of a precarious position in the first place from the sound of
it.
