I saw this on everlores front page....


  
    Article Title:  Info for Windows 95 Users...
[Subscribe to this document]
 
  

It appears that the issue in regards to windows 95 users no longer
being able to play EverQuest without paying the $100-$200 cost of
upgrading to Win98 is more wide spread than we thought, and appears to
be a rather heated issue.

As such, I am in the process of working with another individual in
investigating just what legal actions, if any, might be avalible. As
part of this reseatch, I am interested in getting a general idea of
how many people this is effecting... If you are directly effected by
the sudden removal of Win95 support, please send me an e-mail at
zackron@everlore.com to let me know. Also, those that I hear from via
e-mail, I will keep posted on what our investigative results on this
matter are.

Of particular interest to us will be the current and future customers
taht purchase Kunark, or one of the other earlier releases of
EverQuest, who have Windows95, and are never able to install and play
the game because of the new restriction.
