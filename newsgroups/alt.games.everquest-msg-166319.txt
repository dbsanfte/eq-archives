I was using first person perspective, thats not it.  Nor do I care about how
fast it seems... the real test is, am I outrunning the mobs or not?  With Aria
on I am not, without it, I am.

Probably the pathing, though, as I went on to several other camps and found no
difference in that crucial measure of speed with or without lev.

"If you bought Tboots for a bard" he says.  As if there's a class in the game
better suited for useing TBoots!  We kill things while running, everyone else
has to stop moving to cast.  My bard runs more in an hour than my cleric does
in three days.

Selos, you may be thinking.  Well Selos means taking one of my three song slots
that I can twist and giving it up to movement; cutting a third out of my damage
output.  OK, Chains.  Well, same result, one third of my song output devoted to
something that isn't doing any damage... and worse, this one only hits one
target, so if I have multiple mobs on me, the rest catch me and eat me for
lunch!

49 selo may well do the job, I can't say.  I'm afraid, though, that it will be
so fast that I'll be lapping my prey in tight quarters!  Further, Tboot
duration is much longer than 49 selo, handy for venturing indoors, doesnt' take
a song slot either...

Whats wrong with TBoots for other classes is that you have to stand still to
cast... but bards don't have to... and can easily be interrupted.  Well its
still possible to be interrupted, as a bard, but it happens much less often,
because most interrupt turns out to come from the mobs moving you, and that
doesn't affect bards.

Frankly, 1 to 48 at least, Tboots are among the top two purchases a bard can
make.  JBoots mildly better of course, and a really good drum would be a strong
contestant for the very top slot.

For any class that will be using the things heavily, TBoots/JBoots are a much
more economical purchase than SOW potions, my cleric went thru over 4Kpp in SOW
potions (at 100pp per 10 shot) leveling from 30 to 40 alone.    And thats not
taking into consideration the nuisance of having to find the things and the
many backpack slots/bank slots they took up.
