The internet ad market went straight to hell. Advertisers finally
figured out that they were paying Allakhazam for an ad, since he gets
so many hits, but they were getting about zero visits to their site
from the ad (let alone someone actually buying) The problem is that
the average person looking at websites does not like advertising, go
figure. It is a VERY STUPID ASS way to check how your ad is being
seen. Think of it this way, if you could watch TV without the
commercials, but you saw a banner ad at the bottom sometimes, would
you ever click on the banner ad to see a commercial? No way in hell
you would. That is why the whole thing is such a crock of excrement.
of course the bottom fell out, I mean, freaking DUH NO ONE IS GOING TO
CLICK TO GET SPAMMED WITH ADVERTISING, DUH!!!! DUHH!!!!!

Eqprices sucks ass anyway, with people making up arbitrary overcharged
prices. Allakhazams is still good for free, you just can't list
equipment by zone. Do it the old fashion way of going Equipment/by
slot/list then looking down the list. You can see the average price
people stick up there that is arbitrary still that way. 

I Notice that EQlizer also went to a pay model. They mostly sucked
BEFORE they did. No way in hell I'm paying them. They will probably go
under. 

What a lot of people don't get is that these were started as non money
making hobbyist sites. They then got very popular so needed more
bandwith so they went semi-pro with advertising. So, what is the
answer then? Is it to pay them some charge to keep them alive? Hell no
it isn't! That only perpetuates the problem. What should happen is a
natural evolution where all the sites that can't afford to stay up
die. What will then happen is that people seeing a need for quest info
and such will make web sites but this time they will do so in a
SENSIBLE way. One such way would be a conglomerate of people making a
site like allakhazams and I only handle neriak, you only handle
butcherblock, etc. The amount of people looking at allakhazams each
day is huge, but the amount of people looking at things to do with
neriak each day is small. If they all used the same web hosting
company, the change would be totally seamless to the onlooker.

These simply really can't be businesses anymore when the ad market has
fallen out. Allakhazams might be the one site which can still stay
alive but some are going to die and they should die.

The best pay for site I've seen is Maglo.com It is good because it
actually offers a SERVICE rather than just letting you look at PLAYER
SUBMITTED INFO (from players just like YOU and I) The magelo's you see
of people's equipment is totally free. The charge part of the site is
a VERY sensible charge for letting him host a site for your guild,
complete with message boards and such,  with the magelo system where
you can keep track of all the characters in it automatically with the
magelo character sheets of the guild members and even "equipment owned
by the guild" stipulated in those magelo sheets. It is a very good
business model for an EQ site because it is a real added-value, non
player submited content service.
