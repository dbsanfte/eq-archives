You know it does, and thanks for the rez.  :-)

I can't stand people who bail out as soon as *they* get *their*
corpse, while other people are still in need of assistance.
Checking my logs for that mess, I see the following highlights:

   00:40:08 -- Killed by Vox
   01:54:27 -- Killed by A Priest of Nagafen while mostly
               naked and assisting with CR
   02:22:24 -- Naked corpse rezzed
   03:25:58 -- Clothed corpse finally recovered and rezzed
   06:45:05 -- Finally camped after all corpses that could
               be recovered and rezzed had been (we had
               to give up on a few because the owners had
               logged out for the night and could not /consent).

I stuck around until there was nothing left to be done,
and so did you, many thanks, even though you weren't part of
the original raid party and just came afterwards to help
sort out the mess.
