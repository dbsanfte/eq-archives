Heh c'mon now Mark,
    Arrows are vital to Rangers.  All of the extra skills given to Warriors
(exclusive of berzerk, and I'm talking pre-51) are given to Rangers using
Archery.  Any Ranger who does not use that ability is ignoring his/her best
skill.  Bar none.  It's a big deal to Rangers.  The ability to fletch,
however, is only a part of it.  Not the whole.  If you want the best of the
best Ranger ability you'll have to use fletching.

-Grim.
