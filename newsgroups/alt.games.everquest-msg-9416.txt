Heretic hut in tox is a 4 spawn on a 5 min timer, and undead too. Youll need
to get someone to break the spawn for you. That will take you to 12 and you
wont get any competition over the spawn. Its by the north side of the river,
just SE of the druid ring.
After that, EK is good till at least 16. Anywhere by the water is pretty
safe to pull to.
