Mod rods arent cleric and mage only

Look at a really big damage mob fight, 1.8 second cheal rotation, say 6-7
clerics on it.  Thats pretty much chain casting cheal versus a mob with
several hundred thousand k hp so its not a fast kill by any means.

You obviously can't sit and med, so this is where flowing thought is so
crucial.  FT alone isnt enough tho, its in addition to an absolute ton of
mod rods that are used.. the mage needs mana to keep this cycle going

So you attack Dozekar while your shamans and wizards are all out of mana?
Again, im *not* refering to the however many hours of clearing into the mob
(I've already said this)

You can be oom for the past hour in HoT and it matters not.. you make damned
sure the whole raid is buffed and FM beforeyou engage though

That seems totally absurd.   A cleric can *never* have too much mana!

Im not arguing for mages getting FT items, I specificly refered to the
simple fact of them being oom holding a raid up.

On many raids we need a supply of rods on the floor before the mob is even
inc - if this hasnt happened yet, the mob isnt even going to be pulled.

Another example I can think (Dain) where if the magician isnt
FM/afk/whatever, the monks don't even attempt to start the pull

Well thats because of the class roles...  it makes sense that a magician can
kill a mob with less mana/faster time than a cleric.. mages are an offensive
class.

Wizards are also renowned for stealing clerics mod rods!!   Manaburn is real
low agro, so a common thing is to manaburn at the very start of the fight,
then modrod back to FM and cast their regular nukes for the rest of the
fight.
