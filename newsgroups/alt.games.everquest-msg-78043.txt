Problem is that even if you raise trooper to non kos and then do the
bone chip quest with mozo, you don't cover all the cab factions. As a
warrior this would make it impossible for you pretty much since you
can't invis in the places you'd have to just to be able to bank
(unless you feel like spending 10 plat a pop on invis potions)

You raise cab residents via the bone chip quest but it misses a
faction in cab such as cab citizens or something. So I think you can
bank but can't really shop much.

The real question is do you feel like getting 5,000 bone chips in
order to even fix some of these factions? I have a dark elf cleric of
innoruuk and she is warmly to cab guards, glower dubious to one type
of iksar sk that patrols outside and still threaten to the other type.
The odd thing is I think both of the sks are the same faction but it
takes more faction to raise one.. odd. She has turned in something
like 2,500 to get that far and this took quite an amount of time.
Finally a fellow dark elf sk friend told her it was about 5,000 chips
for him to just get to the point of banking and he had to invis
through most of the town still.

Compared to doing this the run in FV is trvial, if you can't handle
that you sure can't accomplish this. She bailed and instead went to
velious at 35 where she chould shop the same places as everyone else
and even raise dwarf faction to the point where she could train at the
cleric guild there pretty fast.
