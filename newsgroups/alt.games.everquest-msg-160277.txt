Hi Guys,
Lately I have been hunting Elysians in Umbral Plains to get some armour fo
my 53 Wood Elf Druid. As long as I have C3 I can hunt them quite effectively
but of course  it takes a lot of mana to bring one of these mobs down. I
have bought some arms which give me a mana free Drones of Doom DoT which is
helpful but are there any other items that could give me a mana free dot
with more punch?
