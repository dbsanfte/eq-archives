Offense has been capping easily, defense lags a bit behind but
isn't bad.  Piercing is doing ok (which is to say slow) and hand
to hand is terrible.. ok, so I didn't start hth till 5th, but its now
at 21 despite me using it any time I'm not in trouble.  Dodge is
shooting up like a rocket, I'm at 20 already and just put my
first point in (which gets what, an 11?) a couple blue ago.

Need to set up a situation where I can practice throwing,
its at 6 I think, cause I've been using it only to pull, and only
for the past couple levels.

Hmm, bind wounds is at 25 or so, and given my fizzle rate
I sure need it to keep going up.

Caster skills are really really slow to raise, I must have
cast inner fire fifty times for every increase I have so
far.  I just spent 12 practices in abjuration, though,
since that seems to be my group combat spell for
the next several levels, and I -need- it to work, while
everything else I have so far can work or not, no big
deal.
