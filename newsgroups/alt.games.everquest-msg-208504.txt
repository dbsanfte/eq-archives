It would be necessary to

A) specify a server
B) specify a time zone for which "9:30 tonight" applies.  If we guess we only
have a 1 in 24 chance of getting it right...well actually odds are we can pin it
down to one in four (anyone not specifying a time zone is almost certainly from
the US of A)... There are actually several time zones that are offset by a half
hour from the ones next to them, and several areas in the USA don't follow the
time zone you'd think, but those are fiddly details.

Odds are best that you mean 9:30 eastern time, because we east coasters seem to
be the most oblivious to time zone differences, probably because ABC/NBC/CBS
announce start times as "9:30, 8:30 central and mountain" or so forth, leading
us to believe ours is the only important time.

You could make a good arguement for listing everything in Grenwich Mean Time so
as to communicate better globally (everyone should know their offset from GMT,
although riddling out what time that is compared to someone else's time zone can
be puzzling), but the US hasn't seen fit to adopt the metric system, so asking
them to swallow global time isn't likely to fly anytime soon.
