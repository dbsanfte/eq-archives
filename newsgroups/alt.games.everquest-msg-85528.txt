No way a ranger can solo this quest. The animated hand *may* be soloed
but I doubt it. Butler and Maid in MistMoore can be soloed though. But
getting to anywhere a burnt sash may drop is tricky. Sonic bats are
not that hard but Lava Duct Crawlers and their BoilBlood DoT is really
nasty, add to this weird pathing near Lava Guardians and Fire Imps (or
whatever) making single pulling very difficult.

To top it off the end mob Vance Bearstalker isn't exactly easy. He
cons yellow at 51, summons, is pretty resistant to magic and hits for
150+. Took him down with a 51 rng, 51 pally and 57 cleric
