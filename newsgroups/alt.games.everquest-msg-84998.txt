I use the friends concept.

i.e

friends nameofchar (adds or removes the friend from the list)
/who all friends
then lists all the friends on line. Granted they have to be on the same 
time. I tend to be fairly free with adding friends but also fairly quick 
at removing them as well.


Works for me ;)
