This page has a lot of info on foods:

http://206.11.32.56/foodstats.html

Specifically:

Snack or Whistle Wetter lasts 15 Minutes per 1
Meal or Drink lasts 30 Minutes per 1
Hearty Meal or Flowing Drink lasts 1 Hour per 1
Banquet or Refreshing Drink lasts 2 Hours per 1
Feast or Enduring Drink lasts 3 Hours per 1


The only feast meal I know of is made from a Rathe Muskie
which is caught in Rathe Lake.
