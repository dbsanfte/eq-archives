I'm with someone else...I dislike the term "chanter" as much as I dislike
"dorf" and "drood."  They're stupid names, sorry.  They went from "cute" to
"stupid" about as quickly as "crack" went from "funny" to "asinine."

But in answer to your question, the Mem Blur line USED to be totally
useless.  Not long ago they changed the Blur line to make it worth memming,
but it's still not a be-all, end-all spell.  I've had to blur something 3 or
4 times before it forgets my enchanter, though luckily it USUALLY lands the
first time, and OFTEN lands the second (if needed).  BTW, at level 58 my
enchanter usually tries good ol' level 12 Mem Blur first...I don't like the
mana cost of the later ones.
