*relief*

Oh izzat all? Dragons luuuuurrrv me ;) and regen + mana free snares keeps
me out of trouble most times.

I am surprised you have trouble getting res's though.I dont think I've
died since about level 45 without having a res, if not immediately
within a few hours. Make it worth the clerics time, be nice and polite,
understand if they cant come and eventually one usually does. Sometimes
thats even the start of a decent grooup ;) ;)
