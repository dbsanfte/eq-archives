This is exactly what I want to do with Draglorvin, my warrior.  He is now
level 19, and I want to take him somewhere I haven't fought before.  I've
done TheLake(tm) with my chanter, and I don't want to do Highpass.  I would
like to go somewhere -different-, even if the experience or $$$ isn't as
good.

Does anyone have any suggestions as to where to take my Warrior?  I don't
want to go to a dead zone, where there's -no one- to group with, but I also
don't want to go to the normaly idiot-magnet zones.

Also, I need a blackjack for Draglorvin to complement his
SomethingOrOtherMace.  Where does this thing drop and can a level 27 chanter
and 33 Wiz take the MoB that drops it?
