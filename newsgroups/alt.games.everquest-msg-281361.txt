last march i went to a party in san fran hosted by the second life crowd,
and the party i was at was reproduced in-game, or the real life party was
meant to follow the in-game content...i don't remember (or believe i ever
knew) which way it was, but it made for an interesting conversation piece

so did the fact that one of the company's higher ups' wife went around
hitting on lots of the software geeks and then making them look stupid by
flirting with her husband

but it was free alcohol, that's why people were there...that's what i tell
myself, because second lifers are worse than the worst of eq players =P

wow this is pointless thread
