Aside from the mana increase, higher WIS makes trade skills a whole
lot less painful. A big jump in WIS will bring those skill increases
in a whole lot faster. +Mana items don't help you at all there.

I switched a few months ago from my 208 WIS druid to a new shaman
who has 129 WIS now. The difference in how fast trade skills go up
between the two is *very* noticable.
