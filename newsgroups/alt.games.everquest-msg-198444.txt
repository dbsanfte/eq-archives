Both a good link, and a good review by someone who was at E3, there.

But onto my own personal tangent.

Almost everyone seems to assume that the women we see for EQ2 are wood
elves.  personally I think everyone has elves on the brain, but eh, it's
understandable...humans in this game have always been mediocre to "ok", so
if we see something truly stunning, the instinct is to say "elf!".

Well, according to this quote from a guy who saw the demo at E3: " i
remember a wood elf female as well ( cute/ huge eyes long ears in greeny
clothes )"  The women we've seen so far definitely don't have "long ears",  
nor huge eyes.

At long last, human women are no longer inferior, woohoo!!  That having
been said, if we truly haven't seen wood elves, maybe they do just beat
out the competition once again.  (Yes, I have issues. Foxeye's wood elven
mom never thought Foxeye was good enough.)
