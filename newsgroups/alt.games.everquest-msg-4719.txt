    It seems here that you are you equating being a female with the need
for 'idiot-ese'.  It may be true that you are female.  It may be very
true
that you are an idiot.  However, the fact of your gender does not
dictate
the lack of your intelligence.
    Many people here are very helpful, and useful in helping others
learn the game.  Others in game can do the same.  Many of them are (or
at least play) females.  I know several other players who are real life
women; they are not any worse or better players than many men whom I've
seen play.
   Nothing wrong with being an ignorant newbie.  Being an ignorant
newbie
who blames their status on their genitals, however, is a different
matter.
