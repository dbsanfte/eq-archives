I must admit that the fast rise had something to do with being ill for two
weeks and off work, so i had a loot of spare time and day time tv in the uk
sucks :) so i had allot of time playing eq.  Also i found some good groups
that showed me arround and what was good i think that after about 15 i did
very little solo'ing up to now.  I am only just starting to solo again to
get my skill at doing it up again.

As for untwinked, yes to the main part i am i have only 3 items that i did
not get myself ether by killing the mob or doing the quest and the items i
were given are not some off the uber items heard about but just mid lvl
stuff that i could proably get myself now but being given a braided iry
cords at lvl 14 for a sow was a amazing to me at the time.  I have since got
several of these by killing thistle underbush while waiting for that bloody
necro to spawn in lfay and regualy give them away to guildies or low lvl
druids i see being helpfull.

My leveling now has slowed down as i am helping people in my guild get parts
for various quests as well as going on the odd raid with them.

All in all i am finding everquest a fun and enjoyable time were i get to
meet people from all reound the world, since starting i now have about 4-5
people that i meet online that i regulay exchange emails with.
