It may be "sadly obvious" (or not, I would have read "Tigole"
as "Tie-gole", not "tig'ol", which makes the spoonerism less
than obvious), but that doesn't make it against the rules.

A spoonerism is simply not a misspelling or "alternative spelling".

I see nothing in Verant's naming rules about, "names which can
be taken apart, rearranged, and then reassembled in the mind
of the reader to end up as something offensive are disallowed".

You can call it "amateur lawyering" if you want, but the fact
remains that if you're going to have a specific, written list
of the sorts of names that aren't allowed, then it ought to
mean something -- names that match one or more of the criteria
are out, names that don't specifically violate any of the rules
are allowed.

It is hardly "amateur lawyering" to say, "while this name
may violate the spirit of the rules, it does not actually
violate the rules and is therefore legal."

If they decide they also want to eliminate spoonerisms and
other sorts of "suggestive rearrangements" of disallowed names,
they should add that to the rule list.  Right now, however,
it's simply not there.

Hmm....  Time to start a character named "Uckfay Ouyay",
perhaps.  :-)

Don't be silly.  What makes spoonerisms allowable isn't that
they aren't mentioned "above", it's the fact that they aren't
"misspellings or alternative spellings", which are currently
the only form of "creative variations" disallowed by the
rules.

Yeah, they should.  But a huge number don't, and surely you
wouldn't want to ban names just for not meeting some GM's personal
opinion of "not reflecting the genre".

The phrase you quote is a statement of intent, not one of the
actual naming rules.  Like the preamble to the Constitution,
it's not binding.

I'm not stating that.  I am, however, stating that it does not
actually violate any of the written, enumerated list of what
names are not allowed.

"Tigole Bitties" is not vile.  It is not profane, rude, or racist.
It is not a common swear word.  It is not an anatomical reference.

Now, certainly, a reader can go through the effort of MENTALLY
SHUFFLING it into something that sounds like an anotomical reference
(and I'm sure that was the intent of the person who chose the name).
But that doesn't make the name itself an anotomical reference, sorry.

If written rules are to have any meaning at all, then they have
to be applied as written.  As the rules are currently written,
"Tigole Bitties" is a perfectly legal Everquest name.

It may have offended her (like the case I mentioned of the woman
who was offended at someone "whistling dirty songs"), but it is
not a violation of the rules.

I'll agree that it's a violation of the INTENT of the rules, but
that's not the same thing as a violation of the rules as
currently written.

I will now close with a semi-relevant joke:

   A psychiatrist is examining a patient, and shows him a picture of
   a black square on a white background.  He asks, "Mr. Jones, what's
   the first thing that comes to your mind when you see this?"

   "Sex", the patient replies.

   The psychiatrist makes a few notes, then shows the patient a
   picture of a triangle.  "And what does this make you think of?"

   "Sex", the patient again replies.

   "I see", says the psychiatrist, who again makes a notation in
   his notebook.  He then presents a picture of a circle, and
   shows it to the patient.  "And this reminds you of what?"

   "Sex", the man says.

   The psychiatrist takes of his glasses, polishes them for a moment,
   and then says "Mr. Jones, it appears that you have a preoccupation
   with sex."

   Jones replies indignantly, "Me!?!  You're the one showing all
   the dirty pictures!"
