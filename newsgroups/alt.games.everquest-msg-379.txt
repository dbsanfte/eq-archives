I have played Everquest on a P200, with a Monster 3D 4 Mb videocard, and it
runs just fine. I now have a AMD 800 Mhz, and a Geforce 2 MX 32 Mb card, and
it runs very smooth. Exept for the resolution difference (640x480 on the
P200, and 1024x768 on the 800) there is not much difference.... of course
the newer PC has a MUCH higher framerate, but i did not notice any
difference in the quality of gameplay.

Also, I had a very lousy ISP which did not work well with any multiplayer
game.... it worked ok though with Everquest, because it uses network traffic
differently.

You system looks fine enough to run Everquest. If you want to upgrade you
graphics card, get a Geforce 2 MX card. These are affordable (+/- $150) and
give you a very good performance in any 3d game environment. You need an AGP
slot for it, but I do not think that is a problem in a PII400....

Go for it and open the box I say!
