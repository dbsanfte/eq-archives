Hmm, interesting.

But you still have to have them targeted to *initiate* the
conversation, don't you?

Or does explicitly doing a "/say Hail npc-name" work as well?

And of course, you can dispense with the "hail" if you just
have the NPC targeted and launch right into your quest
triggering speech.
