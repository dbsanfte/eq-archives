http://eq.castersrealm.com has very nice forms for what 
skills each class gets and when.  I print them out and 
keep an eye on which level brings a skill with it 
(before that, I'd just scroll down the skill list that 
pops up when you right click on a trainer, see what the 
next level was, and come back then - just as easy, 
really - but now if I go away and forget I don't have to 
worry about going into the game and going "d'oh I'm a 
shaman and I don't have my meditate skill and I'm in 
GFay!"
