[SNIP]

I solo often myself. However, my complaint was against people who
EXCLUSIVELY solo and constantly gripe about how VI isn't bending over
backwards to gear their game towards them. Hell, there are necros/druids out
there that constantly have /anon on and /ooc, /auc, and /shout turned off.
If you send them a /tell, they get huffy. Of course, this is an extreme, but
there are those antisocial types who seem to totally miss the point of a
multiplayer game...
