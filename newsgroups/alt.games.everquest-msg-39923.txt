As a 19th lvl rogue, i want to increase the damage caused by my backstab and
piercing.  After much research, i have deduced that the only weapons
currently within my reach are the harpoon of depths or the slime-coated
harpoon.

However, I have heard conflicting costs for the weapons.  I am contemplating
a run from Halas down to the tunnel in East Commons to pick up a weapon but
need to know how much I am going to need. what is a fair price for each.

Thanks
Bobrogy
