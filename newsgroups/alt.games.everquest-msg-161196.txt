I have absolutely zero (0) beef with this list's order.
Very well done.

I would have placed it just behind the Magician (as in one slot
easier than the Magician) for 2 reasons:
(1) The Ragefire camp, and
(2) Competition.

Even worse than camping Sev, everybody in every guild
in the game would eventually need Ragefire, whether
uberguilders or casual players.  Having 8 clerics in your
guild level 60+ without their epics would just be
depressing.

Magician is bad enough...but the pegasus cloak camp sucks.
Why? Because I know that if I as a melee player saw that
damn thing (again) I would kill it in a heartbeat.  Much like
Jboots, free lev for a melee player are such a huge bonus
that it'd have to be a damn good friend to drag that thing
away from me to MQ, or offering enough money to buy
my whole guild horses....
