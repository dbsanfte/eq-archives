Just to see if I have it straight;  If my safe-fall is at X, and I fall 
from Y height (for argument, 100 times in a row), I will get Z damage 
each time - provided there are NO DEVIATIONS in any other variable.  (If 
that isn't clear, I'll take the blame.)  IOW, I fall 200 feet, several 
times, at a certain skill level.  Each time I take damage - say 50HP.  
Total weight carried is the same , no difference in lag, no bugs in the 
area (*cough*), etc.  Also, this assumes no skill-up during this time.  
Am I tracking the idea correctly?

On a side note, I seem to get a skill-up in SF most often when I *DO* 
take some damage.  Kind of a small consolation when you are hurting bad 
enough!
