There is a zone (Sleepers tomb).  To enter it, you must kill a first brood
dragon, some aren't that tough mobs (and have a life expectancy of 1-30 mins
after spawning), some are just real mean mobs.. eg  -

klandikar, zlandikar - WW and DN dragons, neither is particularly difficult
for a high end guild (1 ae fears and dots, the other ae fears and has an ae
ice lure, virtually unresistable 400dmg) - don't expect to see these live
long

lendi the keeper - not all that tough of a mob, but perma rooted (which
makes it annoying and a lot tougher than it used to be)  you either need to
be on CoV faction to get to her, or have a CoV faction magician to CoH your
whole raid - lives in ToV

sontalak - guards the entrance to the Temple of Veeshan.  This is one mean
ass mob, very few guilds have the ability to kill it (and most of those that
can have little use for his shitty loot)

lord yelinak - the "boss" of Skyshrine,  Velious home of the dragons.  I
doubt theres many guilds on your server capable of killing him.

You now need to make a key (in DN, using zlanikar loot) to get to Jaled
Dar's tomb .
Here you hand in your talisman, to receive a ST key.

Rinse and repeat, ensuring you beat every other guild racing for brood
dragons, waiting the long respawn times, and random pop timer, until you
have 20+ keys - this can take a long time.

The reward for this, a zone called ST..  mobs who can drop "priceless
weapons" (pretty good stats, 13/20 for melees, 15/20 for monks)
3 named mobs, who can rarely drop "primal weapons" - something very few
melees will ever ever replace (how many other items can you say that about?)

Eventually you battle down to the 4 "warders" who are keeping the sleeper
imprisoned.  These drop a vast array of loot (specific to them, NO other
mobs drop this loot)... this includes some pretty nice caster loot.  They
also drop a large amount of primals.

When you kill all 4 warders, the sleeper escapes, wipes out ANYTHING it
comes across in velious (players and mobs). it usually becomes bugged tho.

When this happens, the warders are dead forever - no more caster loot
*period*, a very reduced primal drop rate (from 5-10 per raid, to 1 if your
lucky)

You kill the same 3 named mobs every 2 days in a tireless effort to equip
all your guild with primal, and be done with the zone.

There is nothing for clerics, shamans, general casters anymore.. so
virtually all keys go to just melees.  This means your current shamans,
chanters, clerics, wizards, druids, mages must attend every single ST raid,
working tirelessly.

If they aren't there, the raid doesn't happen, sure they are doing it for
the good of the guild, but they are doing the same repetitive shit 3 times a
week, on prexus at least having to get up around 7am est just to win the ST
race, all for little guild reward, and NO chance period of anything for
them.

ST is a very uninteresting zone post-sleeper, with very little loot for the
tireless effort people must put in.

In many opinions, ST post sleeper is a wasted zone.  WTG verant for
imagination in the whole script.
