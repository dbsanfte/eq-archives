FoB got worse with a patch about 4 months ago when they made all of the
scorpions aggro, but it's still pretty good.

I recently started a halfling druid (how unique! :P), and found that
the newbie area in misty thicket it really pretty nice.

Besides the goblins and the occasional wandering orc, most everything
is indifferent, though social.  The level 1-5 newbie area is especially
easy, as there really isn't anything that isn't indifferent to begin with
unless you wander near the undead areas.

The only annoying part of Misty thicket is beyond the wall where the guards
have a HUGE aggro range and will wander off and kill stuff all over the zone,
ks'ing you left and right.  They don't seem to believe in staying at their
post.  Once I got all my newbie armor (and level 12), I headed out to Paludal
like all good little xp grinding munchkin alts should.  I'm having fun there 
starting from the Shadeweaver's thicket end of things and working my way north.
