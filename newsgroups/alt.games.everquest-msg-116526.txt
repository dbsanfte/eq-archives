Please identify your server, so I know not to start an alt there.  Cleric or
not.
People without simple basic understanding of things like this aren't going
to be fun to play amongst for any class.

As I said somewhere else, though, simple solution, you ML in every
group you are in.  Its a pain to have to keep bags empty and keep
track of your start cash for each run, but you will never get screwed
out of peridot expenses again.

Alternately, join a guild large enough that you always raid with guildmates,
and peridot are periodically issued to you by the stack.  I'm not -quite-
in that position, but I do get a stack or two per raid, and never worry
about 'dot use during guild group action as I figure its covered by the
leftovers...
