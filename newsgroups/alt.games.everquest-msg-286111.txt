I can't remember that specific of the bug but there was another bug.
Actually 2 more related to auras.

1: there were excessive disk writes to eq log under the file name
dbg.txt, causing some computer to perform slowly.  A workaround was to
make the file read only.  This has been fixed since.

2: your pet get spell wear off message when the pet gets out of the
aura range.  When you're in a raid with multiple auras going at once
and moving a lot, you get spammed with wore off message.  I have used
the block spell feature and blocked all auras on my pet so I don't
know if this was fixed yet or not.

As for the mount + aura = 20k bug, it was caused by moving both mount
and the aura's center with the player.  If the aura's so much as a
slight off center (which happen with Internet lags), boom player drops
dead.
