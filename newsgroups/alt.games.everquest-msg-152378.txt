Out of curiosity, I did a few calculations.  Scaling from 1.7 to 3.0
is a 76% increase.  This is from lvl 34 to lvl 60.  So I looked into a
mana calculator for a 200 int caster at lvl 34 and lvl 60.  Turns out
that the mana difference between the two scales by the exact same
number - 76%.  So it appears harvest scales at the exact same rate as
the mana pool produced by the int.

However, I have noticed over time that harvest gives less and less of
a percentage of my total mana pool.  This is due to the fact of
upgraded gear, however.  So in that regard, it doesn't *appear* to
scale.

My familiars fade after a period of time, and they survive logouts.  I
don't know how the 54 and 60 familiars work, but my 29 and 49
familiars exhibit this behavior.  It may have been 3 or 4 hours.  The
familiar buff starts to blink like a normal buff about to fade and
then flappy goes bye bye.

POTC is the only mana regen druids get?  (equipment aside)
