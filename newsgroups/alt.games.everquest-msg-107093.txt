What is this, twink a Bard week? =p Although I said in a long time
ago that I wouldn't start a bard even though I wanted to, because of
concerns about RSI, I gave in and started one last week. He dinged
15 yesterday, and promptly died on an overpull, with the AE mez song
in his backpack, sigh...

>Even tho I have just ALMOST made it to twisting 5 songs.. 

I am totally unable to twist more than 3 at a time... No way can I
keep 4 up at the same time. And I'm on broadband... sigh...

Ya, that's what I've been doing too, but I'll imitate Jeremiah today.

Ya, that's also what I've been doing, with the same results as you.

Hmm, while a real scripting language would be nice, it would make
the executable all that more complex, causing it to break in even
more interesting ways than it already does.

It's comma, as you can see in Jeremiah's article. Only works for pause
though. If there's another separator, I've never heard of it...

/pause 3,/stopsong

HTH,
