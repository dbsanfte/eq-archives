The grimlings have been in control of Hollowshade moor for a week now.  This
is bad because I need to hunt the wolves for paws for a quest but they are
all despawned.  I have read that when the grimlings take over bear and wolf
camps then they are supposed to take over the vah shir camp and then players
can end it by killing the prince.  But they never did take over the vah shir
camp.  I have tried triggering the event by killing the chieftain, the
tribal leader, the tough named grimling spawn in bear cave, the conquerors,
and many other peon grimlings.  None has had any effect.  Does anyone have
any clues or suggestions?
