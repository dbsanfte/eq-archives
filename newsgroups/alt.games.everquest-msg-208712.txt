Start from the opposite side of the hole to the ladder and walk towards it.
You'll drop into the Hole but hit the ladder and stop, now look down and
move forward, you'll descend the ladder.
I normally just take the drop, ladders rarely cover much distance and it's
quicker :ï¿½)

My problem with ladders is climbing them with levitate.
