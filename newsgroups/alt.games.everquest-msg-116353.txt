You might as well accept the fact that 800x600 is the minimum resolution for
*anything* these days.  Webpages are designed for it (I know..they shouldn't
be), and games are designed for it.  If it's too small, your best bet is a
bigger monitor.  Also, it doesn't only make everything smaller - it puts
more pixels per screen, thereby giving you more detail.
