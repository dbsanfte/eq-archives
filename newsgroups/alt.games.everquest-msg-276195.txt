Yep, that's what I did.  A friend gave me his account.  I tried to
transfer my cleric to it so that I could 2 box with my beastlord.
They wouldn't do it.

So I made sure billing info matched on both accounts for one month of
billing, then tried again.  Still rejected.

Called and explained what was going on and what I was doing.
Accepted and moved.
