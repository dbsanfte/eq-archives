Well, I think Druid Quadding is a valid strategy, but they should be
considerate about it.

I believe most Druids start around 39, but I'm not sure.  It's whenever you
get the targetted DD spell that affects up to 4 mobs.  I think the name is
Lightning.  Sorry I can't be more specific, but I'm at work, and big brother
watches web access, hell he might be watching THIS, but I'm on a break...

In any event, go to eq.castersrealm.com, and look up the appropriate spell.
In the comments you should be able to find some guides as to how to do it
properly.  I don't think druids GET a AoE Snare, most of the Quadders I've
heard of will snare each one individually, then run around in a planned
fashion to get them all bunched up together.

Three things:

1) PLEASE BE CONSIDERATE!  Go someplace where there aren't many (or ANY)
other players hunting the mobs.  Quadding ties up four mobs while you slowly
take them down, this is selfish if others are trying to hunt them.  It also
can lead to angry mobs being trained on others so find a good spot with
nobody around.  Please don't contribute to the Druid's bad reputation by
acting like a selfish, self centered child.  If you get in over your head,
lead that train out to a barren area and gate.  You should DIE before you
train them onto unsuspecting people at a zone line.

2) Quadding takes a lot of mana.  Practice with ONE mob to make sure you
have it to spare, then two, and work your way up to 4 slowly.  This will
also allow you to get your technique down pat, the better you are, the less
likely you will do something stupid to get yourself or someone else killed.

3) Quadding is very dangerous.  While kiting I have been known to take a
chance that a mob will get a swipe in at me while trying to land a spell on
it.  Doing this while kiting is suicide.  When there are four of them, the
first round of swipes can stun you, and you will very likely STAY stunned
until you are dead.  If you practice with one, and it manages to land ONE
hit before it's dead, you are not doing it right.

Personally, I tried it, and decided I could take four down individually
almost as quickly as quadding four all at once.
