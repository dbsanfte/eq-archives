A suggestion here that nobody else has made:

Mages can summon arrows at some level (not sure *which* level...)

So if you know a friendly mage you can ask them to summon some arrows for
your skillups. They're not very good arrows, and they'll be NORENT so you'll
have to use them in one session, but the price is right. (You may want to
offer a donation to help cover their time though.)
