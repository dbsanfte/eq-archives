All the songs being played on the radio are designed to either reinforce
pain or joy, and they all seem to be written about me even though they were
written as much as 30 years ago. They all seem to be centered around a theme
of doing something with my life other than sitting in my room alone.(Which
is what I have done all day by the way) This radio station apparently caters
to young men, perhaps some of the guys in this area do the same thing that I
do? That can't be too incredibly good for the economy......

I read there is like a million guys between the age of 20-35 that basically
spend all their time alone in their rooms in Japan, perhaps a similiar
phenomenon is occuring in this area.

There is not much the government can do except try to use the mass media to
influence people that I know of to fix this problem, and it would appear
that is what is occuring.

That happens to be a field of study that interests me a great deal.......
