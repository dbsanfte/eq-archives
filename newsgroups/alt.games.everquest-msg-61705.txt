You are most probably right, but for the.0001 percent, I will say this small
bit.  Along with receiving a few "wrong tells" I have also sent a few.
Usually it is one of two reasons though, second of which is rare; (1) I get
in conversation with two (or more) people and /r to the wrong one, or (2) My
wife and brother play.  I have accidently sent a tell to similar names (this
is rare, because mistyping a name usually results in "so and so is not
online at thise time," but  I wanted to throw that out, because, although
I'd never short hand "wru" to a stranger, I do it all the time to my wife
and brother.
