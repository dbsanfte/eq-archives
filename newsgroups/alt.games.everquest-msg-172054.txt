Let's not misconstrue my message. I don't get upset about it either.
It just doesn't make any sense to me why people would alter terms in a
manner inconsistent with the original for no reason. Why not just call
it what it is? Why "wizzie" instead of "wizard"?

The faction hit metaphor I used was meant to illustrate that I don't
make any sense of something about a particular person in that
circumstance. When that happens, the natural tendency is to find them
just a little odd. Not obnoxious or rude or inconsiderate, just a
little (maybe even *very* little) odd.
