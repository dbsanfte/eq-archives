Flags are similar to keys, yes, but the requirements for getting some flags are... well they aren't so easy,
although I'm sure you'll get people to contradict that.

Getting flagged for POV/POS, the most popular exp grounds for the high levels, requires passing a trial in POJ.
While people have argued that other trials are easier, only one gets any serious consideration, Trial of
Execution.

In this trial, you can take a maximum of 6 people, who must then kill 4 mobs in a row in under 30 seconds each,
repeat that 3 more times, then kill a fairly powerful boss mob while already injured and/or low on mana from the
waves.

This isn't impossible, but it -is- difficult.  Once you've done it, there is no further benefit to doing it
again, so the only people you get on a pickup basis are people who have never succeded.

A guild can flag people, but they do so at the sacrifice of the time and energy of their already flagged people;
and depending on who is trying to get thru, it may take as many as five already flagged people to do this.

There is often a line, and every time a group succedes it takes 30 minutes before another can go in; this means
it may be 45 minutes or longer before you can go in, and another hour plus (if you succede) before you can go in
again for the next person up for the guild to flag.

In short, its a royal pain, and you get a trickle of people going in.

Committing to doing it anyway works pretty well after a while, but if your people are more interested in
continuing to level themselves up, the gulf widens at an alarming rate, tier two exp is so much better than tier
one that people who ARE flagged are rapidly level 65, and there's nowhere outside the upper tier planes where
they will get noticable experience, so they tend to do less and less outside that tier.

Its not insurmountable, but there's certainly potential for some difficulties, if the guild wasn't a tight unit
to begin with.
