Hello again friends,

I play a Barb Shaman on my laptop.  I recently had to un/reinstall EQ on the
computer.  Since reinstalling I can't put a beard back on my shaman.  To be
honest I can't stand to see a Barb without a beard, especially a Shaman.

Anyway tonight, I un/reinstalled again and same thing no beard.  Any ideas??

Also when I put in the facial features it appears that his right eye is
missing, it is like there is a black hole where his eye should be.

Thanks,
Innoruuk Server
