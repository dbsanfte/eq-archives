Befallen is the best place to go and it is very easy to practice there.  The
level of the zone has been lowered so it is very safe now and even when it
was a higher level you could still hide/sneak to practice.  Practicing PL
does not break your hide/sneak.  The locked door is in the second door on
the left wall.

Don't worry about the trap doors, you don't even have to go past that area
to get to the door you need to practice on.
