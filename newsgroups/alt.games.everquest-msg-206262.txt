The general opinion on the EQ clerics forum seems to be that CA is *the*
best combat-based AA for clerics, bar none. The description in the game
is misleading; one person parsed a 7% drop in damage with CA1 - probably
from a green MOB, however. In actuality the drop in damage taken is highly
situational, depending on the MOB.

The reasons for CA being highly regarded come to (obviously) the drop
in damage, but just as important... if you aren't hit, you aren't
interrupted. It gives you an extra chance to heal yourself (or get off
a DA or DB).

Note that I don't have *any* combat-based AA myself, at the moment. But
read the eqcleric forums and you will find an *overwhelming* majority
speaking for Combat Agility.
