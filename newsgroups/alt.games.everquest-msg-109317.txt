He he he... there comes a time to stop paddling, bailing, etc and get
out of the boat, DT. You've reached it on this one. To refer to your
original text (which apparently Ben wasn't even *directly* addressing to
you, sadly.)
******************
Nice spam for your character for sale. You were pretty stupid about
it, though. Basicly just told us what server the character was on and
what his name was. Oops!

As if anyone with the IQ of a doorknob would want to run around with
the name "Slayzu"...
******************

Granted you didn't say his gear *wasn't* fake. You also didn't say that
Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny aren't real. But you certainly made no
reference to the gear being illegit, so at a minimum, cut us a break and
admit you can see how most folks would have thought you took it for real
gear. If you knew it was fake, why would you fail to mention it, even in
passing, and choose, rather, to attack the stupidity of revealing the
character name and server?

Why am I here again? You know, I have no clue at this point, but I've
typed all this dribble now, so I may as well hit send.
*sigh*
