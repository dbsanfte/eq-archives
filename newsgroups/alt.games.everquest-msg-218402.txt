From Miriam-Webster online:

Main Entry: OK 
Variant(s): or okay  /O-'kA, in assenting or agreeing also 'O-"kA/
Function: adverb or adjective
Etymology: abbreviation of oll korrect, facetious alteration of all 
correct
Date: 1839

Can't vouch for it's correctness however, but a quick google search seems 
to confirm that.
