The out of game lists will be updated within a week or two; that appears 
to address your real complaint.

That has always been like that. I think its on purpose.

You really do only buy spells? :p

/boggle. Nobody needs to know the price for -comparison shopping- 
between npc merchants. They need to know the price for its own sake.

1) Why should you have to hold the alt-box at all, and put up with 
difficult to read lists? Your defending a poor UI simply because it was 
usable, not because it was good.

2) It works in the bazaar... and there are many people who do -browse- 
there.

Up to date spell lists is really all you need, and they'll be here 
before you know it. (I hear some sites are already caught up)

Must be nice to level so often that having to buy your spells is 
noticeably slowing you down. =) 

[Tip: buy 3 or 4 levels at a time :p ]
