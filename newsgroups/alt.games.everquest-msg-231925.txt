Good Point. 

The seller should set prices he deems fair and equitable. If you spent
30 seconds farming that LQ cat pelt, what circumstances would justify
your time being so valuable that 50pp is an equitable trade?

Even if you spent 2 hours farming that pelt, chances are that your
level or ability would prevent you from making 50 plat in 2 hours. 
So effort to farm still doesn't equal the effort you would spend in
obtaining 50pp.
