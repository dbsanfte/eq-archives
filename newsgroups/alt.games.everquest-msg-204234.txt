I think it's the 'stories' text you have to repeat for your AA. The
other one you say once to get your charm. Charm is then autmatically
upgraded whenever you repeat the 'stories' text. 

With one Flag, the charm won't be all that great but still better than
what I had in that slot, which was nothing <g>.
