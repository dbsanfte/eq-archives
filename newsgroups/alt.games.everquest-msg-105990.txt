Wow, someone actually remembers me.  I was trying to make
alt.duke.basketball a fun place to hang out.  Unfortunately, the
propagation on the froup was very spotty, so a lot of people couldn't
read it.  (I haven't checked recently, but I know Google didn't even
have it last time I looked.)  Plus, there is another froup I hang out
in, that gets a lot of wacky and weird stuff and I realized that by
pushing alt.duke.basketball, I was actually hurting the content of the
other froup, which had better propagation and a lot more content to
begin with.  So being the patriot I am, I abandoned alt.duke.basketball,
for the good of my friends, and fellow members of the Kamikaze Peep
Squad.
