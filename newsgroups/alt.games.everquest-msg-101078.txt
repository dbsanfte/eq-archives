Ok. So right there you state you have to have the people you're
blaming for interfering with the freemarket and messing it all up
to interfere with the free market and make it all fine.

What, businesses will rent out their competitive advantage from the
goodwill and competitive nature of their communal hearts?

Living in the UK I've seen the "Forced rental" scheme 
on things like telcos, electricity, gas, etc. Consumers
dont switch even though the prices may be lower, and the established
players can afford to discount and target service wherever required
to hamstring the opposition.

Once the oppositions gone, guess what happens?

And in some cases, like the rail system here, the ideas of leasing the
shared infrastructure have resulted in services and pricing so markedly
WORSE than the monopoly system present previously that its literally
a national scandal regularly reported on.

The established players comply to the letter of the law, but not
its "level playing field competitive" spirit, because, well, they're
*competing* actually, and they have an advantage, and they want to
win, and they're going to use it.
