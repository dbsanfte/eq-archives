For the record, I really like the PvP servers... they add a whole new
dimension to life on Everquest... and I'm not complaining b/c I know that
this is the way life is...

But I'm just curious as to exactly what high-lvl players who go around
killing babies get out of that kind of behavior?  I mean, between lvls 8 and
10 with my two PvP chars I was PKed 4 or 5 different times each by red
conned players... let's see, they get no exp from the kill, can't loot (not
that I had much on my corpse that they would want anyway), and I'm
absolutely no threat to them, so it's not like they're protecting
themselves... and since I'd never laid eyes on them b4, I know they didn't
have some grudge against me...

I much prefer to play PvP on the principle that if you're my enemy, if you
do something to make me dislike you, then I kill you on sight (assuming I
can of course :) )... if you're not an enemy of mine, even if you're evil
and I'm good, I may not be best buddies w/ you but I won't attack you
until/unless you give me a reason...

In any case, if you're the type of player who RPs to the extent that anyone
of a different alignment is your enemy, why kill babies?  It's not really
something to brag about, and I for one would be quite ashamed of myself if I
went around killing players that I could kill in one or two hits...
