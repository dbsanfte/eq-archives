Yeah, it was something like that.  Something along the lines of "I'm all 
for religious freedom and everything, but I can't abide wicca, because 
that's witchcraft."  Of course, now I'm having trouble finding any 
reference to it...  And had a brief moment where I thought I might be 
misattributing a quote from some lowly candidate for Kansas Governor or 
something.  But you remember it too?  Ok then.

I swear, I need another 512 MB in me head or something. :)
