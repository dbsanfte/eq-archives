How can anyone not like the map system?

Someone in my guild made a comment similar to yours and the very next day we
were deep in a zone when they got on and someone told them to "invis and run
to the red".  They were obviously in the dark, and the guild had a good
collective laugh about the silliness of their remark the day before. 
That person is using the map system now.  :)
