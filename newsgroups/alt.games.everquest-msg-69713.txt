I also live in Australia and while this has been a problem for me, I mostly
solo at the moment anyway, and if there is anything important then often I
can arrange to make a raid.  I have only come across two other Australians
on my server, but since my character is now level 44 and the guild I am in
while I can't always be on with them does support me and I have lots of good
friends there.

I suppose it doesn't really answer your question anyway, but just thought
I'd share my experiences as a fellow Aussie.  I am Mith Marr by the way.
