So, who deserves it the most?  The same guy, over and over again?  Or do we
recognize everyone's contribution to the raid, if they did, in fact,
contribute?

So, how long does the level 52 cleric wait until he's allowed a few crumbs?
By your arguments, no one should get anything until the MT is fully dressed
out in all the best gear.  Now, if the MT is handing down older stuff to the
lower tanks, that may be acceptable.

Dunno, every time I see some people, they're wearing a different tag.  Gotta
wonder if the exception isn't the rule in this case...

Seems to me DKP or a fair loot officer is the way to go.  "Equip the MT
first of all, and everyone else get bent" just doesn't seem to cut it.

Actually, I loath random.  It's unavoidable in xp groups, but I think it has
no place in raids.  It's just that I'm not any more fond of plutocrat loot
either.
