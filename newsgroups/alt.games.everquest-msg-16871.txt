Dear:
  [x] Clueless Newbie         [ ] Lamer           [ ] AOLer

  [ ] Trent Reznor Wannabie   [ ] Monkey Spanker  [ ] Ex-AOLer

 You Are Being Flamed Because:

  [ ] You tried to blame others for your stupidity
  [x] You incorrectly assumed unwarranted moral or intellectual

 To Repent, You Must:

  [ ] Pretend you're Trent Reznor
  [ ] Actually post something relevant
  [ ] Shave your head
  [ ] Read the FAQ
  [ ] Post your tests to alt.test
  [x] Watch WWF Wrestling and like it
  [ ] Print your home phone number in your adverts

 In Closing, I'd Like to Say:

  [ ] You're an idiot
  [ ] Blow me
  [ ] Get a life
  [ ] Never post again
  [x] I pity your dog
  [ ] Go to hell
  [ ] Learn to post or sod off
  [ ] Do us all a favor and crawl into some industrial machinery
  [ ] See how far your tongue will fit into the electric outlet
  [ ] All of the above

end flame.
