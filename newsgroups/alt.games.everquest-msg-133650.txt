Inny sees invis.  And he hates me.

Wait, he hates EVERYBODY...it's sorta his job.

Mistress of Scorn and Corrupter of Life both see
invis, too, as well as Maestro and some of the
mini-bosses (Innoruuk's Chosen has seen
invis sometimes, sometimes not...but I'm leaning
more towards "I got lucky with sneak" than that
"she doesn't see invis").

Also, don't forget that ALL scorn banshees and ALL
loathing liches see invis.
