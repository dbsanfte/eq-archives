Well, I tend to believe she is both. Despite her claims of being the computer
professional every company would want. I don't think she really knew about all
the various ways that your password can be commandeered on the Internet. She
may have a basic knowledge of PCs, but that is about it. I doubt she has ever
spent any time in alt.cracks, alt.2600, (or their sub-NGs) or alt.security to
find new tricks and tools for both offense and defense. I doubt she has ever
read anything other than the mainstream press on the steps to protect your PC.
Then, when confronted with the fact she was staggeringly wrong, she did like
too many people do--she simply decided to avoid what she had said, while still
claiming she was correct from the get go. 

I mean, come on--she said that your password is not subject to being pilfered
on the internet! We are all being bombarded with messages (well, at least those
of us who keep up on computer SECURITY) that your e-mail is subject to being
read by everyone on your local network (be it school, work, or cable modem) and
by every sys admin and techie between you and your recipient. What makes anyone
with half a brain think that your EQ password is any different?

Encryption is worthless without TWO encryption keys and a changing message. It
is also worthless when the encrypted result is used as a key.

Simply put, it is the laziness and stupidity of others that keeps your account
from being hacked.


================================================

"Stupidity is the most common element in the 
Universe, and one of the most destructive.
Fortunately, it tends to form a solid bond with
laziness, which is the second most common.
Without the abundance of laziness in the universe,
we might all be dead."
