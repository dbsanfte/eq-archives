Ok, I played this game a LONG time ago -- back when the 'new' Burtoxxulous
server was set up and had to quit right before Kunarak was released.  I've
been back in the game for about a year now -- on Povar server (Started back
on Burtoxx but CS there flat out SUCKED!  Povar was MUCH better).

Well, Sunday I finally decided to check out this new $40 a month membership
server...  So far it has been a great experience...

First off, if you were one of the old timers, you can remember when the
server numbers showed 800 to 1000 and folks got worried about overloads at
1200 to 1500 people.  You can remember when zones had like 20 to 50 folks in
them and at around 100 or so, they were way over crouded and you began to
get nervous about them crashing...

Kind of like that on this server.  Low population density.  Many places with
no one in them.  Camp spots you find permanently camped on other servers you
can get into fairly easy here...  Kind of a blast from the past but bringing
your chars with all equipment and bank with you.

Second part of this has been the CS and events.  In the long ago, you used
to be able to get ahold of a GM when you needed to.  They were always
available and you actually had to petition for your surname at 20th level
and speak with a GM directly about it.  Well, that isn't needed here but you
get responses from GM's in minutes on petitions, they hold several events
each day (EVERY day), etc...

So far, in 5 days there, I've found the attitude of the players on this
server to be far mellower than on the other servers, folks willing to help
out more here, overall the impressions here are:

1)  Genareal environment is REALLY quiet -- not as much /ooc and /shout
chatter anywhere...

2)  Folks here tend to be players who have played quite a bit.  Know the
various classes and play them decently.

3)  Due to lower density and competition for "good places" and "good stuff",
folks tend to get along quite a bit better.

4) You don't see anywhere near the quantity of "KSing SOB!!!" type stuff as
you do on the older servers -- happens?  yes.  Seen 1 person say something
like that in 5 days of heavy play.  Hell, I'd see that 5 times in 1 day of
LIGHT play on other servers...

All told, the most interesting group of folks I've run into on this server
are the ones from the PvP servers that moved over.  Because moving brings
everything with you and you no longer have to worry about being murdered and
ripped of at every turn, they go a bit bonkers at all the stuff for sale
that they couldn't risk having and using on those servers...  Interesting to
hear some of the stories they have and they are a fun group of folks to meet
and group up with ;)

Anyhow, thought I'd drop a note on this to the news group.  The place isn't
any better or worse than the old servers with respect to RP'ers or l33t
d00ds or what have you.  Just the folks here tend to be more quite and laid
back here than on other servers and the service is much nicer... (want to
have fun though?  you should see the auction channel...  sheesh...  folks
from all different servers on this one...  prices can varry so massively for
the same item and the discussions on 'accurate' prices are great to listen
to!) <grin>

Cio for now,
