Ill Omen, though it's rather crowded...but a large zone. Stonebrunt is
highly underrated. If you're a darkie, you could get a tank partner
and hunt along the shore in OT. Just stick close to the shore, there's
a huge jump in levels of mobs if you move farther south than the south
edge of the outpost.
