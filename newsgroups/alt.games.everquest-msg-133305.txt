Dear Mr. Troll,

Why would you play any game where you could cheat to "win"?

No go away.  Also, please give your parents birth control literature as they
should never have any children.  For you, please, oh please learn everything
you can about birth control and use the knowledge at all times.  You should
never, ever spread your seed.  (I do doubt your ability to find anyone who
would let you, though).
