I haven't found Yvolcarn to be much of an "eat you for lunch" type problem.
More of an "oops...have to gate out" problem.  He's not snarable or
rootable, but he's slower than jboots, so I've never had a problem simply
running for a while, then gating.

He's got a pretty big aggro range, so it is a good idea to always make sure
you know where he is before you go kiting things around there.
