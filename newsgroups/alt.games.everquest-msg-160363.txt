Yes, well, at 22 for my Druid, and 15 for my ranger, I would have to rely on
someone else to do that.  While wandering around without wolfform, I have
definately been attacked by cats, in a number of places.  It has been some
time since I have played them outside of Paludal.  Well, except for that
forray to WW with my druid to forage Dragon Eggs, which is why he is now 22.
He was standing around, foraging, tracking and fishing, when out of nowhere
this Dragon decided that he looked quite tasty.  Fortunately, he was bound
right where he was fishing, and the Dragon had moved on by the time he
popped in place.  Got lots of skillups in tracking, fishing, sense heading
(maxxed now), and swimming, and even 3 in foraging.  Got a few Wurm Eggs,
Drake Eggs, one Dragon Egg, as well as other miscellaneous stuff, including
one Tuft of Dire Wolf Fur.
