You folks really are making too much out of this, but that is
understandable.  Check with anyone who played on Test during the
equipment wipe.  Logging back in on the first day with no equipment was
funny as all heck.  But even with every single player naked and in need
of equipment, folks got back on their feet pretty quickly.  Folks would
group up together to go get everyone minimal items so they could go hunt
for the better items.  Both the higher levels and the lower levels who
made the effort were back up and running in an amazingly short period of
time.  Personally I was as concerned as anyone else that our chars were
nothing w/o equipment, but ended up having a blast fighting naked to
make enough money to even summon my first pet hehe.  Moving naked to a
server where you have friends would not be as hard as folks are
thinking, at least thats my guess.
