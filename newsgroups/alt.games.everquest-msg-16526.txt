I hear ya man! I left Diablo2 because you couldnt log on....and when
you could the whole place was Korean. "GIVE ITEM PLZ!" I asked the
moderator Gfazier why didnt they make more asian servers if it was so
popular and he replied that the asian server is 3 times as big as all
the other servers put together. Screw em. Let em have Diablo and
whatever that other game is. Any country that eats dogs and drinks
cats is something i want to stay well away from.
