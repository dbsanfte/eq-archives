Oh, lordy.

Until they did a bunch of patching a (relatively) short while back, Baking
was easily the worst.

You were able to get to 142 without too much trouble (as long as you could
forage), but after that the only way up was via farming *brownies*.  And
that, when all was said and done, only got you to 162.  There was no way at
all available to get past 162.  Then, they added a new way with Velious.
You could get all the way past 200.  All you had to do was farm *dragons*.

Now, as long as you're willing to mash your "forage" button enough, you can
get to 202 on pixie genocide and cinnamon.
