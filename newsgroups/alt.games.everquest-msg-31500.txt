They may be unnecessary. They may even be unconstitutional. But they are 
STILL the law (luckily I live in a state that does not have such a law.) 
If you feel that strongly that it is unjust or unnecessary then get a 
petition going around to change the rules, but don't put down someone 
for following them. Obviously it DID hurt her because she took the time 
to petition it.

Like I said maybe so.... or maybe she likes seeing justice done. Maybe 
she feels that his HAVING such a blatant violation is a taunt to her? I 
don't know and it really doesn't interest me. And even if it IS just for 
spite how can you judge her because of it? It's just another rule to be 
broken right?

No, and I don't intend to. Did the one with the lame name turn 
him/herself in? I intended to show that I would not whine about the 
result.. as is the case here. (Or not.. we have yet to hear from 
"Wantsomedrinks")

And what do you do if your definition of "hurt anyone" differs with 
others? Do you STILL respect them and not do it? Or do you disrespect 
them and "do it 'till you puke."??
