Actually, I saw people selling them, and since I havent logged in in 6
months and dont plan to, then I thought what the fuck, might as well... I
sold a level 55 Cleric on TZ for almost 500$ before.. why not sell a porter?
Ohh, I get it, account selling is "frowned" upon by this newsgroup... thats
why everyone has such a shitty atitude towards it...
