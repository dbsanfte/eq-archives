And now I'm getting to that point where the Blur is getting less worthwhile 
in serious battle situations.  If I don't have a rooter in the party ( last 
night all 6 of us could root, now nice =), then I'm a little more nervous 
than usual.

Your tactics are noted and will be tried, for sure.

I started messing with targeting and assisting the mezzed mob to check 
hate.  Kinda like it.
