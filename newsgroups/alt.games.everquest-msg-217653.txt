90% of everything is crap at a minimum. The chests are not useless on all
settings . Chests are fairly useless for normal ldon adventures. Chests on
hard raids are quite interesting :)

It would probably be very worthwhile if you could memorize the dungeons to
get hard raids that have a chest right at entrance or a mini named spawn
spot near entrance for farming. The equipment available from both are
completely ridiculous.
