Yup, an exploit.  Exploiting the pathing.  There's a number of these in the
game, and, well, I've used probably all of them (east of the Karanas,
anyway).  I can't remember any instances where I've used it to kill a
critter, though I have no problem using them to escape death. :)

My iksar was in Crushbone and, being the master swimmer he was born as, if
it looked like he was going to die he jumped in the canal, jumped out the
other side, bandaged, mended or just sat down for a few hitpoints.  When the
orc got close again, he'd just jump in the canal, climb back out and
continue to heal.  At the point where he had enough hitpoints to make it to
the zone he'd do that.  Hmmm, I may have used that tactic on an orc pretty
close to death when I was as well, so I guess I'm guilty of using it in the
worst possible way.

I wouldn't make a practice of it, though.

If you're caught promise not to whine about it, ok?
