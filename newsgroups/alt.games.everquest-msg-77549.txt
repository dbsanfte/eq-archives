Having a druid handy and my mains bound on the moon, I don't know the answer
to this one....

Does every single Nexus port go at the same time?  I mean, I'm ALMOST
positive all the Norrath to Nexus go at the same time (I missed one once on
an alt and had my druid port him to a couple different pickup zones); and I
know that all Nexus to Norrath go at the same time.

My question is this:  Does the Norrath to Nexus port and the Nexus to
Norrath port happen at the same time?

Rephrased, will it always take me (supposedly) up to 30 minutes to port from
GFay to NK (getting to GFay just after the previous portal, porting up to
Nexus and then just missing the one going back down so waiting another 15
mins)?
