No sh*t, there I was.... a dark elf shadowknight hanging out with 3 froglok
paladins and a high elf paladin, all waiting for that nobleman's hilt to
drop. There's a second "a skeleton" down the left-hand fork from the spiral
stairs, about p225, p100 (going be eqatlas map), and a 3rd "a skeleton"
down the right- hand fork, about p300, 0. All of them can drop the hilt
(and did, eventually). They're on a fairly shortish timer -- around 15
minutes as I recall. And there's plentry of living and dead souls you can
punish in that downstairs part to pass the time.

We had a grand old time! I spun them some story about being a paladin like
them, but had fallen in the felwithe blueberry vats as a young child. And
now I can sleep soundly knowing that at least one paladin has been denied
a ghoulbane because *I* have it. Bwa-ha-ha!
