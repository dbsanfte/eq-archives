I know in the Houston Texas area right after the attacks 5 tanker trucks
were stolen/disappeared (gas types). Add to that all the talk of terrorists
trying to get hazardous chemical licenses... They haven't been found yet...

Day before yesterday also in the Houston area 750 lbs of dynamite was
stolen.

You won't be hearing this on the news but believe me it happened. This is
from a long serving police officer I know down there.

Anyone else have any contacts like that and hearing any similar events?

Knowing your neighbors also includes knowing what to be alert for.

FBI stepped up it's warning of an attack in a couple of days too.
