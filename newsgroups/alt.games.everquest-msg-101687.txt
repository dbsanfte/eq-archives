Your stats are fine.  STR is more than you need, but not by much, and WIS is
less than wonderful, but easy enough to raise.  Don't worry about it.

The main thing to keep in mind is this:  DRUIDS ARE CASTERS.  Casters don't
hit stuff and expect stuff to die by hitting it.  Casters kill stuff with
spells.  If you want to beat something to death pick a melee class. :)

Now, granted, at level 13 you CAN beat stuff to death...slowly...simply
because almost any class at 13 can beat stuff to death.  But since you're a
CASTER, start thinking about how to kill stuff using your mind instead of
your body...it'll come in danged handy soon enough.

Also work on your WIS...the higher the WIS the more spells you can cast
before being forced to meditate.  Keep an eye out for mana items as well for
the same reason.
