Assume for the sake of arguement that you had 30 points banked.  And you had
at least one of the AA abilities that got refunded.  You now have more than
30 AA banked... and you'd best spend them fast, because when PoP is released,
you are going to lose every point you have over that line.

If you leveled up to 60.999 and 30 AA, then went away to Bali for a months
vacation, since no further advance was possible anyway till the release, if you
had any of the wiped AAs, when you got back in November you'd be screwed.
