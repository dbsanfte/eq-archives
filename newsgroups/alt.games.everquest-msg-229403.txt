On Thu, 18 Dec 2003 06:27:14 GMT, I needed a Bable Fish to understand
"P2" <dontemailme@dontemailme.org> :

>What is a fair donation to a cleric who casts these two spells?

Depends:

Virtue: id consider you an ass if you donated any less than 30 pp. 
 I  usually donate 40 - 50.

Aego:  Id consider you an ass if you dontated any less than 30 pp
I usually donate 30 - 40.

Temperance:  Id consider you an ass if you dontated any less than 20pp
I usually donate 20 - 30

KEI:  Id consider you an ass if you donated any less than 20 pp...
I usually donate 30 - 50 depending on my need....

This is just me... not many people are really "worried" if I think
them an ass... just my personal stance.
