Ok, heres what happened.

While we had a group of 6 we had a druid be the master looter, since he
could gate in and out to sell.  Well, on the third gate, as he was selling,
or had sold and was on his way back, he went link dead.  We waited for over
an hour for his return.  Anything that can be done? Or is this just one of
the consequences of being trusting and just chalk it up as a loss.
