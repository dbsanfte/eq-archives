When casting Divine Aura on my cleric and am hit I get the same message
"Englebert Humperdink tries to hit you but you're INVULNERABLE" or something
like that. Perhaps this fish was buffed as such. Too bad you didn't have
time to run... KRUUUUNNNCH!!! Loading.. please wait.. lmao! sorry...

BTW, EH is a super-duper rare spawn in the lower depths in Vegas of Las
zone. I doubt you'll ever see him and live to tell the tale.
