Actually, killing wisps, bears, cats, spiders and spiderlings in
EC and WC can easily net you over 1kpp on your way to level 15.
(only the 'lings and some baby cats will be green at 10, some of
the others will green out along the way).  Greater Lightstones
(from wisps) can be converted to a container that sells for 9p5g
(plus some xp) if you are able to trade with the gypsies (in Oasis
or NK).  Quality bear skins sell to players, as do quality cat
pelts, spider silks, and spiderling silks.  Also, some of the junk
that drops sells for 2g or more to NPC vendors, mostly stackable
items at that! It has never been so easy to fund an untwinked
lowbie in EQ, EC/WC is just one example, other newbie/lowbie zones
also offer opportunities.
