Is there a problem running eq with winMe?  I ran eq with no problems up till
about 7 months ago when I quit for awhile.  Now I reloaded it up and am
having some problems.  Everything is the same except I changed from win98 to
winMe.  I have music but no sound.  But I did have sound in the tutorial
(didn't want to embarrass myself with a L31 newbie).  The other problem is
when I go into the options menu (in game) and then into the general menu,
the music slider and the sound level sliders are messed up.  The music
realism slider is way off to the right of the control and cannot be dragged,
and the sound level slider is not visible at all.  I have an athlon 800MHz
with 256MB ram, a voodoo3 3000, and a soundblaster live.  I have gone to
3dfx and creative websites for the latest drivers but that helped not.  I
have directx8.  Any suggestions?
