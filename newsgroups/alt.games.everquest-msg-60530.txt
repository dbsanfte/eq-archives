Not so sure this is the case, I have a dwarven warrior who worships
Brell Serilis (IIRC), and he wasn't KOS to the Brownies. I'm not sure if 
this was a bug or not, but it was a lot of fun pulling corpses for higher 
level characters, financially lucrative too. Plus there was the added 
danger of just about everything in the zone (other than brownies of course) 
potentially killing me. :-P
