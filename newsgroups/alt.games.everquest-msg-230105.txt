Oh good, at one point they were saying 3 tics, but I did hear a rumor 
they went with 6 instead.  I haven't played bard since the patch, nor 
with one lulling, so I'm not really down on exactly what did end up 
happening.

Often, you only need to lull one mob to do a single pull, where not 
lulling at all will chain from one to the next to the next bringing a 
whole room in, but lulling the second mob in will let you bring the 
first without any problem.

The luxury of the 5 minute lull was that you could lull several mobs in 
a room and then pull one at a time as each previous pull died.  Now you 
need to lull each time you pull, so the dynamics are different.  I don't 
see where there's much difference between 30 seconds and 42 seconds for 
this purpose, though.  18 might have been tight, if you needed to lull 
more than a couple mobs per pull it would become impossible.

I do think you'll see two things; more people forced to learn how to 
lull as few mobs as possible in order to get a single pull, and more 
groups discarding the lull concept entirely as too time and mana 
consuming.... if you are lulling 5 mobs one time and breaking the room, 
thats one thing, but if you have to lull 5 mobs, then relull 4 mobs, 
then relull 3 mobs, then relull 2 mobs, then relull one mob... well, 
thats 3 times the mana and 3 times as much time spent... and 3 times the 
chance of a resist pulling everything down on your head anyway.  If you 
are capable of doing the single lull method then its the same number of 
lull casts (or sung) as ever, though.

Something thats suffered even more from the nerf is using lull to skip 
past content.  Unless you have a very clear area to move to where you 
won't run any risk of aggroing mobs you  passed earlier, lull movement 
can easily lead to disaster.  Sadly, I've been in many LDoN runs 
(assasinations, that is) where the only way we managed to get to the 
boss in the time provided was via this method, so the nerf makes 
assassination even less attractive to groups than it was before, which 
is a pity as I thought they were fun AND groups that don't stand around 
refusing missions for a half hour just to get a slaughter are a lot more 
fun.

Splendid
