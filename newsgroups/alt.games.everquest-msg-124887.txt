Well, I have all of the maps printed from eqatlas.com for the continents of 
Kunark, Odus, Faydwer, and Antonica, as well as some velious and luclin. I 
have the map printed of EVERY city, in a seperate section of the binder.

Not to mention the countless sheets of "this and this for this quest goes 
to this dude" and scraps of "my corpse is at 4325235, -432532411124124" 
(thats not a real loc, except maybe in OOT). I also have useful sheets 
(math equations, abilities-by-level, spell list by level, etc) scattered 
throughout my house.
