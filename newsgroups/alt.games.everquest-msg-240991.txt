Installed directX 9 a few months ago, the MS website says that 9.0b
was published in July so I assume that's what I've got (can't find
an obvious way to get the system to display the installed version for
me).

I run with all models off via the one line .ini file option that turns
'em all off, and I run at medium.  Not everything is hatched, I get
psychedelic backgrounds with animated models looking mostly normal.
It is very reminiscent of what would happen on my old Pentium MMX /
Win95 / Voodoo Banshee box when it was about to crash while playing.

Thanks for taking a shot at it, any more ideas?
