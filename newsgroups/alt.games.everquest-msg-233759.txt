what level are you?

it IS a good idea to work 1HS for offhand.  my 1hs at 44 is about 110 while
piercing is maxxed and I'm hitting for 69 in offhand with my 1hs weapon
(Defenders Lightblade) and a max of 60 with my piercer (Legendary Dagger of
Might or Ancient Rujarkian something or other).

yeah, definitely work it or dump some training points into it.
