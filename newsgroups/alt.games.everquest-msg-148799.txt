Sorry, no.  The first thing I ask for when working on any code I support is
the steps I need to take to reproduce the problem.  If it's not reproducible
... if I have no steps that I can run to make it break 100% of the time, I
have no way to debug reliably.

Coming into the situation blind, I have no way of knowing if the problem is
a bug ... or a stupid user trick.  Reproducibility is the key.  If the
problem can be reproduced, it's a bug.

If a single client reports a problem, and they don't know what they were
doing when it FUBARed, don't remember what happened right after it FUBARed,
and can't make it FUBAR again, there's precious little I can do but hope to
get another client having a similar problem.  I'll set it aside and work on
verifiable problems that can be fixed and see if another comes in so that I
can start drawing conclusions.  If you start trying to fix stuff based on
one client reporting a problem they can't make happen with repeated
reliability, you run the risk of hosing stuff up.  Big time.

Multiple clients having similar problems is a different matter entirely with
regards to reproducibility.  Even if the problems aren't identical ... so
long as they're close enough I can do a bit of trending and take a few shots
in the dark with a reasonable chance of hitting upon a problem.

It's like taking your car to the shop and telling the mechanic that it was
making a clunking sound ... but it isn't now and I can't seem to make it do
it again.  Not much the mechanic can do with that.  You get pissed at the
mechanic?  Don't ... get pissed that it happened, sure ... but don't take it
out on the mechanic if you can't produce a car making a clunking sound.
