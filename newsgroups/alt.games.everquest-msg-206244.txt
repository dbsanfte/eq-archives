    Yes, now compare costs. To get HG 3, he would have had to not spend one
point in five other areas. So no Channeling 1, Fury 1, Stability 1,
Reinforcement 1, and Avoidance 1 (picking the five most likely to be
tossed). He loses out on a ton of small advantages for an AA that, instead
of doing nothing 98% of the time, does nothing 90% of the time. Ooh. Aah.
About the only AA that would be worth that would be SCM, which really is all
that and a bag of chips.

> He could of maxed really usful skills

    No, he couldn't have. He doesn't have enough total AA points to do that.

    It's also regressive. Look at Gift as an example. For 2 AA's, you get a
2% chance at a crit. Then for 4 more AA's, you get a further 3% chance at a
crit. Then for 6 more AA's, you get a further 5% chance at a crit. Levels 2
and 3 aren't as efficient as level 1 - you're getting less return per AA
spent. Most of the cleric AA's are like that, the most obvious example being
Mental Clarity (2 points for 1 mana regen, then 4 points for the same, then
6 points for the same). Reinforcement is one of the few AA's that scales,
but it isn't as useful at what a cleric spends most of their time doing at
that level.

    It's situationally good. It saves a lot of mana in a place like CoD,
where almost anyone that gets hit ends up with a DoT on them. I consider RC
3 to be a core ability of a raid cleric - it's that useful.

    Stability helps with soloing, much more so than Avoidance, because the
bulk of a soloing cleric's damage comes from damage shields. Over the
weekend I went on a bit of a wander, and found the fire giants up in Sol B.
Soloed Tranix + one add, also soloed Skarlon (he pulled single). If I'd had
more mitigation I could have cleared the three giant pull before Rokyl.
Didn't matter, because Nagafen was up, but I could have done it! ;-)

    Yeah, he could join you folks, get fully geared, and move on to join
KtF!
