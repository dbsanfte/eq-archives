This was a defect inherited from EQ1.  I maintain my EQ accounts in
hibernation in hopes that they will revive the solo play game.  Post level
60 soloing is mainly the realm of highly powerful solo classes such as
beasts and mages often seen duo-ing which is just another form of solo play
where most people two box to do so.

The rudeness I have seen many EQ2 people refer to is the EQ1 dementia which
grips most of what was always termed the Uber-Jerks.  They only add another
to their guild/group/raid when they perceive a benefit.  The player addition
(read-YOU) must always be in line behind them and all of their alts for the
loots and groovy digs of whatever is to be had.

This was discovered early on in EQ to become known as the EPIC lists. 
Enture guilds would form for the primary goal of accomplishing these many
impossible (solo impossible) quests.  Each person in line would acquire
their EPIC one by one and discover their calendar was now FULL of work to do
helping a hundred other people get their EPIC too.  They would leave one by
one shortly after getting THEIRS and the people down toward the bottom of
the lists would be left holding the bag and never get their EPICs.

A totally stupid system only even possible coming from the small minds and
closed ears at Sony..

I'll be playing WoW thank you.  (typical Sony uber-jerk response - say
something rude like so go ahead and quit we dont want you anyway - to which
I respond - I'm so happy Sony made EQ and EQ2 because ti is a magnet for
assholes and makes ALL the other games SO MUCH NICER to NOT have all those
IDIOTS circulating within - ANY game is improved by your lack of presence)
