I see.
So because a warrior, the single most equipment dependent class in the
game has a large selection of equipment, you want equal or comparable
selection for your necro, the single LEAST equipment dependent class
in the game.

Is that the line of your thinking?

Or did you just fucking neglect that consideration when you decided to
whine about the lack of equipment for what is arguably the god class
of EQ?
