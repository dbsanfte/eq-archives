The 5/6  or 85/15 unflagged rule thingy - whatever doesn't apply to level
limits for zones.Otherwise u could have a level 1 toon in potime or whatever
;P Even with alt access for some zones like say Plane of valor, i still
think it has a min of 46?

As for xp for a 50, well worth checkin out the current hotzones for that
level.. The hole ftw! (ok thats a biased suggestion based on my love for
that zone)
