Learning to play a druid is easy.
Learning to play a druid well, on the other hand...

The grouping skills of some druids out there make me somewhat worried
about the day one of my alts groups with people like them... and the
kiting skills of some other druids, let's not go there. (I know I suck
at kiting. So I just don't do it :) )
