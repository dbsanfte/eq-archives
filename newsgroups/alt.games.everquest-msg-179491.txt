Not all the newbie armor quest containers are 10-slot. The Bone Mail
Assembly Kit for Dark Elf Shadowknights is only 8-slot, for example.  And
some newbie armor quests don't give out containers at all!  Troll, Ogre,
and Barbarian Beastlord quests just require you to turn in items directly.

As far as I know, only Beastlords of the Troll, Ogre, and Barbarian races
have newbie armor quests; the other classes permitted to those races do
not.
