"Reises pig"???  Surely you're not suggesting that I am peanut butter
surrounded by a tasty, crunchy candy shell, are you?  That would make about
as much sense as suggesting I am racist, simply because I point out the fact
that there is no Palestinian state.  Tell me, now, how does that make me
racist, I'm dying to know.  Hey, maybe if you're lucky, I will burn in hell
(a very kind sentiment of you, it's nice to know I'm dealing with a
rational, kind soul).

Those "half-brothers" of yours are making a mess of your house.

Are you sure you live in Isreal (ilove_georgeclooney@hotmail.com just
doesn't give much indication)?  Have you not noticed that they're _killing_
your people?  I don't give a hoot what they were taught, what they're doing
is murder.

> i have an idea, indted of spaming them way won't you try and be

Listen, my little George Clooney fan, this computer thing isn't all that
difficult.  Take a look up near the top of your screen.  You see those
things listed in the "newsgroups" section?  Those were the groups that the
OP posted to.  The reply that I replied to came from one of them, but I
can't be sure which one, so I replied to them all, just as you did.  Hey,
what do you know, would that make you a spammer, as well?  Ooooh, shame,
shame.  Does that mean you'll be burning in hell right beside me?  Please
bring the marshmallows, since I didn't have enough time to pick them up
before you banished me here.

> friendly to them, get to know them. not all of them want a war, most

Ah, I see, somehow pointing out that there is no Palestinian state means "I
want war with them."  Dang, I missed that subtle nuance.

> of them just want to live in peace. so way won't you shot your mouth.

Madam, only one person here has succeeded in shooting off their mouth, and
it's not me.
