Ok I know tribute points were added to the game w/ GoD.  I purchased the
expansion but haven't had any time to play since it went live.  I have a
couple of questions regarding Tribute points.

1.  Who do I turn items in to for points?  I am an iksar shaman worshipping
Cazic-Thule, is there someone in Cabilis that I need to turn items in to?

2.  What can I expect tribute points to do for me?  Flowing thought?  Haste?
HP regen?  AC?  or any of a combination of those things?

Ok, I guess thats my only questions.  Thanks to all who respond.
