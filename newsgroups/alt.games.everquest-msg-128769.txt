Money-lending was, by and large, forced on the Jews by the Church.
The various Church decrees had some fairly explicit prohibitions
against usury (charging unreasonable interest for loans).  Ergo,
proper Catholics didn't do it.  However, at the same time there was a
need for the ability to get loans.  Many of those same Church decrees
*explicitly* excluded Jews, so that there would be someone who could
provide funds for others' use.

There was also a very large body of Classical work (Aristotle, Plato,
Aristophanes, etc.) which decried the practice.
