The first one was heavily discussed in beta and I'm glad they did *not*
put an arrow on that map. I mean you do have a compass and a map that is
oriented with north being top. So it shouldn't be much of a deal to
figure out your heading. And it resembles more the standard way of dealing
with printed maps imho.

Though I'm sad to hear that the other points weren't adressed by the
devs as they too were discussed in beta.
