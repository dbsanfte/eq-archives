Using what precognitive faculty? I started my monk with the release of
kunark and when I started my druid, I did so because monks were nerfed (I
think this is when SoL was released and they wanted to promote beastlords
instead?) and I went from being relatively useful to finding it hard to get
groups, and having a druid enabled me to generate cash via farming, ports
etc to buy the gear for my monk to make him more group desirable. The fact
that other classes that pretty much took over the monk slot (beastlord,
berserker) didn't help either.

I see. If I say my class is not needed, then that's a whine, and let's not
deal with that, let's just attack me instead. Have you considered a career
in politics? Try honestly considering this: I have been in many groups where
they can't start until they get a cleric, or a chanter or a warrior, or at
least are reluctant to. I haven't been in a group where a monk or a druid
was being actively sort for for many years, i think the last time was before
harmony was nerfed for druids and before monks were nerfed.

No I didn't say crucial. I said needed. I said that several druids can do
the job of a cleric, or several monks can do the job of a beastlord. But the
newer zones I find root and snare either can't work or just get resisted
over and over (light blue mob in dranik's scar, resisted ensnare 3 times in
a row, no message about it being immune). A druid can't work crowd control,
like a chanter, buff, like a cleric or chanter, etc etc.

Sigh. More personal attacks. No, stuff it, i'll agree with you and say that
he and his entire guild couldn't think of a better set of tactics than the
ones we were employing. We are all inadequate and bow to your awesome ex
druid wisdom. Whatever we were doing must have been wrong and you would have
done so much better, because you say so, and why should I doubt your word?

But going back to the point, just for a moment. Druids are needed because?
They are important to the game because? People say "we really can't do this
without a druid" in what grouping or raiding situation?

Really? I doubt your honesty. Either that or you had much better gear than I
used to. The point is, given equality in gear and xp, most of the zones now
will require better healing than a druid can pump out at the levels I played
up to. I'm willing to concede that a post 59 druid might have a different
experience but none of that detracts from a central point. The class is not
needed. It's utility has decreased for years. People used to love grouping
with druids in outdoor zones. They do not possess that enthusiasm at all
now.

Nah, I just liked trying to communicate a point. Having failed to do so with
yourself, I'll give up at this point and merely retire from the game. Before
I go, I'll state I had a pair of clerics (eduras and fayeth) and an
enchanter (murmurs), a shaman (billio), a warrior (banda) and every other
class bar wizard and bard and I found that the monk and the druid were the
ones that people didn't invite out of the blue, that were ignored when
people had slot spaces in a group or taken up grudgingly while they kept
recruiting for a cleric or whatever.

The classes of druid and monk are not needed to everquest, they could be
removed completely without an impact.

And so with those words he removed tobalus the 59 druid and eski the 57
monk.
