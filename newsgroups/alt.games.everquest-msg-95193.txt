Jeez, it wasn't even a reply to  post of mine that I originally followed up 
to, it was  a reply of yours to someone else's post, and I had no idea who 
you were replying to since I wasn't about to go and re-download deleted 
headers of stuff I've already read and chucked away just to see what the 
hell you were on about.

I'm sure you don't think that, however I'm also sure you think your own 
opinion is required reading for the entire newsgroup, and I thought I might 
give you some advice on how not to have every single person here completely 
ignore everything you say. I guess you must think your own opinion and 
advice *doesn't* matter then.

LOL! *You* want *me* to relax? Hello Mr Pot, yes I am a very black kettle, 
aren't I?

Look, I'll even go to the trouble of finding out whose post you replied to, 
I'll look it up on Google...

Oh look, it was richardrapier@netscape.net, i.e. NOT ME.

By happy coincidence, it was another Richard, who you seem to be confusing 
me with, but believe it or not there is more than one person on Usenet 
called Richard. See how confusing it gets when you don't post any context 
for people to see what you're responding to?

Hmm, well I am obviously harassing you with my 'incessant bitching' in my 
grand total of, ooh, let's see, *3* previous followups to you, two of them 
in this thread. Let's see, I've replied once when you posted A HUGE FUCKING 
IRRELEVANT COPYRIGHTED BINARY ATTACHMENT to a non-binary group. I didn't 
ride your case, I just agreed with someone else who said that doing that 
sort of thing is likely to get your account suspended by your ISP if they 
ever found out, and pointed out the nature of that binary.

The second time was to try to suggest you include some context so people 
knew what the hell you were replying to. The third time was responding to 
your suggestion that I obviously knew what post of mine you were following 
to when I said that to say, no, actually, I didn't, since it wasn't a post 
of mine.

Still, thanks for showing that you are a complete fucking moron rather than 
just a newbie who needs to learn some netiquette.

Thanks also for suggesting I killfile you, I was actually considering doing 
that when you provided one and a half megs of shit music for me to 
download, but I thought I'd give you a chance and see if you would pick up 
some netiquette after the inevitable flaming. I think I'll have more fun 
now though if I actually get to see your fevered rantings, they are sure to 
become quite amusing.
