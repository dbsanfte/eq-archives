Did you look at the link? That particular figure was dated Auguest 2001. 
2 years old... but still 7 months after Velious came out so its not 
exactly ancient history either.

Seeing as it was put out by Verant/Sony I think the figures can be taken 
as accurate. No matter how many assling druids you think you saw... 95% 
of what you saw wasn't halflings ... of any sort.
