Hmmm...HMMMM...true, no reason I can't make the option available.  It
might be a little too complex for my current $25 buckaroo price, but once
it goes up, yeah, I'll implement something along those lines. I was
already intending to have the "look over the sketch" stage in there, so
it's no extra work on my part.

Now you sound like my husband....that's his new favorite word. He's
perpetually teasing me that I'm not only gaining an artists
"thenthitivities", but because I've been learning at such a fast pace, I'm
getting massive growing pains of the over-sensitive artist type.  I do
know I get massive attacks of "how could you like their artwork Kael, mine
is so much better?! /pout /scowl /stomp off".

Huh, now I'm curious...but there are actually so many who fit this
description that I don't really need to know.  LIke I said, I waited for 8
months for my picture of Foxeye...I think it was that alone that drove me
to learning to draw for myself.
