Yep, using fast one handers and trying everything she can think of.

She actually got a watchman off me today after it had been my
pet.  I stopped singing everything, took attack off, and just watched
it beat me down.  I got to just over a bub of health, it finally turned
and attacked her... for about three swings before it turned away from
her as well and tried to run.

Without some way of deliberately ditching the aggro, I'm afraid I
need to go flat out and suck it up like the poor excuse for a tank
that I am, with both she and I hasted, the formerly charmed mob
slowed, and me also running strings healsong we seem to be able
to get the mob before it kills me.

Too, when it gets rough I recharm, she binds me while I alternate
healsong and recharming.  No danger of her getting aggro and
the bind wounds getting interrupted I can assure you!
