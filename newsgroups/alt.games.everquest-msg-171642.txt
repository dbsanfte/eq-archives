Speed of Vallon :P

If VoG and WR (or Shissar) are my only choices, I would go with VoG every
time.  The haste cap on a level 60 melee is 100% from items and spells
combined. (not counting certain specific bard songs).   I have a 41 percent
haste item, as many melee do, so the choice is really between 99% haste plus
20atk, or 100% haste.

More important to me though is the spell duration.  There are fewer things
that are more disasterous for a raid than having haste run out on the main
tank mid-fight.   Trying to type "/t
Some_enchanter_with_a_really_long_and_complicated_name HASTE NOW!"  while
kicking and taunting and trying like hell to maintian aggro is not fun.
Trust me on this, I've tried it.    Even if not in a major fight, the
additional hastle of having to ask for haste twice as often makes it an
annoyance.
