Chris,

Good job!  You should be proud.  Unfortunately, I didn't learn of the
Mage armor quests until I was level 24+.  I know, I know, but my buddy
introduced me to the game and doesn't do any of that stuff, and as I
played with him exclusively at first, I didn't get to any of those
things.

I started them because the only good items I had were a robe,
headpiece, and necklace.  The quests were great, and creating the
items correctly were the first puzzle type experiences in the game for
me.  Now all that remains is the robe, and I wonder how good that will
be: perhaps it will replace the one I'm using now.

Also, these quests seem to be good to do solo, I'm doing them with my
little cleric frog Exculpator.  She should be able to get those Kobold
scalps by level 10 - heeheehee.

Regards, 
Julie
