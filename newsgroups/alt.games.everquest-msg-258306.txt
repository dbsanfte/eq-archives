Heh.  That wouldn't be happening, anymore, if I understand correctly.  
They finally wised up and centralized those computer databases.  Of 
course, they still can't actually -check- the computer and tell me if I'm 
eligible for traffic school or not, we have to rely on my faulty memory of 
when I was last there.  But now, apparently, they will catch it and tag 
the points back if said faulty memory was wrong.

I'm pretty sure it's been more than the requisite 18 months though.

Mostly pretty sure. :)

I was always on the other end of that, though.  Traffic school is the 
difference between zero points, and the one point that makes my 
insurance rates go up. :)
