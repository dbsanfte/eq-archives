Ok, thought of starting a druid, but only because the few people I play
with need an adaequate transportation unit. Could not get me to play
a wizard... even if they can do the plane ports. Now, it would also
be sad to level this druid up to 40, and then only use it for
transport. So the question is: Sometimes I get the impression, that
only warriors/clerics are of use on highlevel gaming and about
nothing else, as none of the non-specialists or hybrids can take
the firepower up there or be of any use (ok .. it's not that drastic,
shamen can still slow a lot and so on, but still ... uneasy feeling).
Given the time of my life it takes to level up to 40 .... is it that
bad as a druid up there? Would you rather suggest a wizard if the
main goal is transportation?
