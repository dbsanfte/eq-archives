I had exactly that available, including Mapquest, to me here. I accessed 
it through one of the local news station's website.

Can't speak much to that other than to say I agree there should be more 
local information available. I still say one should vote for their 
candidate of choice.

In 9 instances should there be representation of those you mention? Do 
they make up at least 1/9th of the religious population of the country? 
How about even your locality? I think that's kind of nit-picky, really. 
The churches are *not* being endorsed. 

My local polling place was previously in the activities center of the 
nearest Catholic church. Aside from seeing the statue of the Virgin Mary 
out front when I pulled in and parking in the church parking lot, there 
was really nothing of any religious context involved in the experience. 
There were no religious adornments that I can recall on or in the 
building where the voting took place. It's not like people had to go 
through the rectory to get there or anything. I was not bothered in the 
least, and I'm not Catholic.

Now I can certainly say that if it were conducted on a Satanic church 
property, I surely would have felt differently. I think that if you 
compare the number who would be offended by having to visit a Catholic 
church-owned property with those who would be offended by having to visit 
a Satanic church-owned property, it would be plain to see why one is 
viewed as more acceptible than the other.

I'm sure part of the reason non-government buildings are used for polling 
in the first place is the fact that there aren't enough government 
buildings around to ensure voting is convenient enough for everyone in 
that locality. Short of grocery stores, I can't think of any other type 
of building that would be present in enough local areas. Schools are an 
option also utilized, but even they are too far apart in many cases.
