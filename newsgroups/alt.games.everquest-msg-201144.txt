Because Stamina gear is the hardest to find and str dex easy for melee and
int wis easy for casters I generally put as many points into STA with any
character I can and try to get all stats above 75 then important ones ( to
me ) above 100 as soon as I can.

As far as gimping your self. This game is far more level based than anything
else. I swear I could have all stats at zero and Mob level would matter
more.( exaggeration) Agil zero is painful /grin.

I am making an assumption just because you asked the question you aren't
trying to get the rogue into a high end raiding min max guild and just want
to have a playable fun toon.

If that's true and you never tell anyone your stats and you play the rogue
well. No one will ever think your "stats" are gimped. I speculate that even
if you played well in an uber guild your stats wouldn't matter. Uber weapon,
haste and str perhaps dex and you are g2g I would think.
