It wouldn't matter where the servers are located Patch day all the servers
come down at the same time. I thought the servers were all in one location
until about 6 month ago half the servers came up and it was another 2 hours
before the rest came up in the chat room they had a message location
something or other is having net work problems. Just be grateful that Verant
is doing patches once a month for the most part, it used to be once a week.
