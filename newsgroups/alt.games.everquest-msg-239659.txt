so lets think back to my definition.  i said it means you DON'T KNOW
something, right?  and last i checked, uneducated means you DON'T KNOW
something, unaware means you DON'T KNOW something, and uniformed means you
DON'T KNOW something...

as for the whole "buffoon" thing, have you noticed that not once throughout
our whole discussion did i resort to calling you a childish name?  i have
simply defended my right to write in the fashion that i enjoy, while you
have become angered and tried to turn this into a name-calling contest.  who
then do you think would be seen as the "buffoon" by the outside observer?  i
ask simply that the childishness stop and that we have a conversation which
can be enjoyed and learned from by both of us.

this i did not say.  you infer too much.  i simply said that i do not like
how many people follow the standards and rules set for them by someone else
simply because that's what they've done all their life.  i believe that it
is that kind of thing that limits peoples abilities.  the people that think
like that are the ones that say "i can't draw," or "i am a terrible writer."
in reality, everyone can draw and everyone can write.  it is just a
preconcieved notion that leads people to believe they are incapable of doing
these things.  with drawing, for example, someone says "i'm gonna draw a
cat."  in their mind they see a perfect cat with round eyes and pointy ears,
you know, the basic cat, but when they touch the pencil to the paper in an
attempt to reproduce their mind's picture they do not see what they saw in
their mind.  "i must be a bad drawer," they say.  never once do they sit
down with pencil and paper and simply say "i'm gonna draw" without knowing
quite what it will turn out to be.  if they did this, they would see their
own skill for what it really is.  they would solely at the outcome, with no
preconcieved idea to compare it to.  get it?  so how does this relate to
writing?  well, in writing, one has been taught the "correct way," they know
where commas should go, when to start a new paragraph, and they know that a
story must follow the plot line (exposition, rising action, climax, falling
action, resolution) so there is the mind's picture of the cat.  ok, ready to
write!  so they sit down and write their story.  unlike the cat, since there
are rules of writing, the story comes out perfect.  but maybe the person
looks at it and thinks "maybe this paragraph should be longer because it
doesn't look right to have a short paragraph in the middle of all those long
ones" or "this sentence should be separated into two sentences because its
too long."  but if that small paragraph made sence, and added to the story,
why did the person feel it should be longer?  and if the long sentence was
not a run-on sentence and it, too, made sense, did it really have to be
taken out?  well no, according to the rules of the english language it
didn't.  so why did the person do it?  because it didn't look right to them.
understand what i'm saying?  so, if literature truly is art, and art is the
expression of one's own thoughts or feelings, should they not be able to
follow whatever rules they wish, as long as the work still makes sense, or
even if it makes no sense at all?

but i think that, just by stirring up this emotion in you, i have succeded
as an artist.  i have touched a place inside you that i could not have
otherwise reached.  after all, isn't all art simply about stirring up
people's emotions?  there are beautiful paintings that fill the observer
with a certain calm and tranquility that can only be achieved through a
painting, there are photographs taken that make one's heart drop in sorrow,
and there are books written that leave the reader angered, annoyed, or even
offended.  would you say that any of these are not art simply because "you
don't like the way it makes you feel?"

here we go with the word "smart" again.  did you read the stuff about Hitler
in the other posts?  we can argue about the meaning of "smart" up there.
but, if i am interpretating what you are trying to say correctly, "smart"
means "to have a closed mind and do everything exactly how you were taught,
with no deviation whatsoever."  in that case, i'm perfectly happy being
stupid...

some people say that Picasso was not an artist because his paintings didn't
"look right," so i do understand where you are coming from here, although
you are further showing your own ignorance.

quick question:  your definition of "ignorant" is unaware, uneducated, and
uninformed.  so if i know better then clearly i am aware that what i'm doing
is not the excepted practice, i am educated enough to know that what i'm
doing is wrong, and i have been informed that most people who write the
english language capitalize when needed.  so if i am aware, educated, and
informed, and the definition of "ignorant" is unaware, uneducated, and
uniformed, i do not see how you have connected the word "ignorant" with me.
