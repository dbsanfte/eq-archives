Caster's had a news article about the new 'promised' interface:

http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=3945

I am bummed it did not make the Luclin expansion date, but
I am glad they are still working on it. I have to admit it was the
main thing that I was most looking forward to. I hope they can
finish it soon.

/em crosses his fingers and sacrifices many small animals to
Cazic Thule that the new interface finally puts a nail into the
coffin of the meditating spell book!
