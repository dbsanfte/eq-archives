Apparently, Woot predates eq substantially.  I've never verified this,
but have heard that it derives from the exclamation "ROOT!" which 
hackers would let loose upon gaining root access to Unix accounts.

Sounds good, but may be completely wrong.

Another one I'd like verified is "The whole nine yards."  My grandfather
maintains it originated in WWII, and referred to the length of a belt
of .50 caliber ammunition for fighter planes.  I've never been able to
corroborate it however.
