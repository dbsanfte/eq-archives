Even more sensible would be to make a *new* zone or two for the frogs.

Here are some places that the frog zones could go:

1. East of Innothule, perhaps connected directly...perhaps connected through
Guk.

2. Southwest of Lake Rathetear, where the lake goes around the hill.

3. Near Dagnor's Cauldron, connected through Kedge.

4. An underground swamp, North of Freeport, connected to the Freeport tunnel
system.  Maybe connected to Nektulos, too.
