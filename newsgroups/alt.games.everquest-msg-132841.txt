No.  It's a way of respecting and honoring the child's concern, of keeping
their curiosity about the world, and of keeping their interest in learning
new things alive without overwhelming them with technicalities that they
wouldn't understand yet (not due to a lack of intelligence, but a lack of
vocabulary).

If you were referring to the process by with a steam turbine functions I'd
word it more like this: this is designed to have water in it get really
really hot and make steam, kind of like the tea kettle or a pot of water on
the stove. You remember  how you see the steam on the top of those? Well, if
you keep the steam trapped in a tube it has lots of power to push things,
and can make another part of the machine spin -- like the wind makes your
toy pinwheel spin.  When it spins it makes power and can light up the lights
in your house.

Again, using terminology and examples the child can understand without being
disrespectful to them by not answering their question.
