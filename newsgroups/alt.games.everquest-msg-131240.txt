Other men -have- to?  You make it sound like such a chore.

}I guess if that's happily married then he's one of the few that thinks

Strangely, he's one of the only two people whose opinion matters in this 
regard.  He'salso one of the only two people who has enough information to 
determine if he's happily married or not.  Unless you have scary 
mind-reading powers or something...
