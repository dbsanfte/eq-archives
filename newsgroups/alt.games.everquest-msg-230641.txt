From what I have read, LoIO now has a lower than normal ZEM. They didn't
just take the newbie zone bonus away they actually lowered it below the
normal 85 outdoor zone modifier. 65 or something IIRC. That makes it a
pretty crumby zone at any level now.

Also, not an issue for people soloing I'd guess, but they capped how
much experience you get per kill sometime in the last year. Over the
years, I've powerleveled quite a few characters with my druid and the
last 2 I noticed that you can no longer get more than a couple of blues
per kill after 20 or so and by 30 it's down to less than one blue bubble
no matter how high a mob you kill.

As to where, depending on your gear and buffs, you might try the
dreadlands yeti cave. It can be good experience solo if you can handle
it at that level. if not try back at 35. 7 static mobs, 2 roamers, all
the statics are single pullable as they have very low agro radius.
