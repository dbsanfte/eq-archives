}Result Guild is still not any stronger.

What is good for the guild is not always good for the individual.  But the 
guild exists for the good of the individuals in it.  If those individuals 
feel often enough that the decisions of the guild are not to their 
benefit, they leave.  And strangely, that's not good for the guild.

The point of this weird circular diatribe is that you can't design the 
system solely on the basis of what's good for the guild.  Or that Tank1 
with his Breastplate of Uberness is going to end up fairly lonely...
