That's basically what I've been doing. Charm a blue con mob, send it 
after a yellow con mob, blast the yellow to keep the blue barely alive, 
then grab easy xp from the blue once charm breaks. 

I do have one question about this whole process. If I dot a mob, then 
charm it, will the dot still tick on it? Just wondering if that would be 
an easy way around working the health down to an easy kill. Once the mob 
is really low, cast cancel magic on it to get rid of the dot, then 
proceed to finish it off...
