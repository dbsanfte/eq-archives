Ah, thanks, I missed where they stated that. I went on Zek for a while last 
night, found I had only one character (I must have deleted the others, as 
I'm pretty sure I had more than 1 on the 4 zeks way back when), played him 
for a bit, remembered I don't like playing druids anymore, so exchanged him 
for a brand new cleric...and got guilded right off, lol. A guild recruiter 
had created a low-level character to sit in the tutorial and grab people as 
they came in. While not a guarantee for quality, she did a great job in 
building up her guild numbers.

I did hear one of the new guildies talking about his higher level rogue, 
with 100k in gear on him, seemed to have gotten 'lost' in the consolidation. 
He petitioned it, but I logged off before I heard if anyone had gotten back 
with him at that time. Not sure how often I'll play the cleric, but should 
be fun once in a while.
