Very funny.  But funnies don't help the guy fix his problem.

This has come up quite a few times.  I think you have textures cached, 
try deleting the .txc files from your EQ directory and re-running the 
patcher.  You can also delete the zone files for the zone where you 
noticed the problems before re-running the patcher.
If that don't fix it, then when you run the patcher, turn off autoplay 
and go to advanced, then do a complete file check. While on advanced 
screen make sure all the expansions you have and the 'optional zones' 
are checked. This option may take a while to run.
