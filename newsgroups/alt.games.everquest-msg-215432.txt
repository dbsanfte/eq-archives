Just some data points for the all 65-hard missions.  Non named mobs
were a mixture of deeply dark blue (63-64 guesstimate) and even cons
(65, natch).  Mobs of this level in PoP usually have around 22k HPs
and I'd guess these were the same going by the time it was taking us
to wear them down.  The even (65) cons were hitting for slightly in
excess of 900 and mitigated slow.
