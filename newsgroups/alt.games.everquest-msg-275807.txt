Yup, I heard someone yelling about it the other day. Checked some
guildmasters, no research. I know that some of them never had it as a
trainable skill, so I checked some more (including hometown and some
that I guarantee had it, as I can find myself training it there in my
log files), and none offered it. I guess they messed something up when
they were increasing the cap on regular tradeskills with DoN release.
