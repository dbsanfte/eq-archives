By some people, in some newsgroups. All I have to
do is find one person whos doesn't believe it is
rude for your dogmatic statement to fall on its
ass.

I don't consider it rude. In fact, I don't
consider it at all. 

It is a matter of supreme indifference to me
whether someone top-posts or not.

I care more about who won the Eurovision song
contest in 1972 than I do about top-posters, and I
find it most peculiar that some people take it as
a personal affront.

What makes people look stupid is the content of
their posts, not how they deliver it. Imagining
themselves to be the final arbiter of what is
rude, and what is not, would be a fine contender.

To some people, in some newsgroups.
