Where would you expect to "hear" it?

I know that back when the general EQ forums were up on the
Verant website, people WERE doing such screaming on a regular
basis.

Every time someone posted a "I've been ripped off and the
damned GM just accused me of giving out my password when
I haven't" post (and they showed up with great regularity,
like one every few days), they'd invariably get a slew of
replies saying, "that happened to me too".

And then there are the bugs.  One of my friends logged off
just before the servers went down for a patch.  He had
Evermon running (back when it actually worked) and the moment
it dinged that the servers were up again, he logged back on.
Everyone one of his items were gone, both from on his
character and in his bank.  Not even a hacker would have
been able to log in to steal his stuff, the servers
were down between his logout and login.  Clearly a database
bug or something.  And yet, the GMs repeatedly accused him
of having given out his account password and getting
ripped off that way.  It took him WEEKS to get someone
to actually understand that it must have been a bug,
and restore his items.

Now, however, Verant would follow their new "no
investigations, it wastes our precious time" policy,
declare his account "compromised", and ban it.

Even in a case as clear-cut and striking as his, he
barely managed to get them to shake out of their
"you gave someone your account" mindset.  How many
actual hackings (of one type or other, there are
high-tech hackings and low-tech hackings) happen
now that never get realized as such, and get
written off as "you shared your account, you
slime, you deserved it"?  We'll never know.

And that is why the "ban 'em if they report anything
missing" is inexcusable, especially when there are
other little-to-no-CS-required solutions that don't
punish the innocent along with the "guilty".
