I've had 2 good ones so far.  Got a Centi Longsword off a vendor for 63
plat.

Less good, but still a very nice bargain was when I got a Sword of Morning
16/27, plus 10 to dex, procs tishan's clash, paladin only for 500 plat.
This deal actually suited me better than the centi deal did, as my regular
hunting partner is a paladin and I play a wizard.  I am used to keeping the
nukes in check so as not to steal the agro, but my buddy swinging this sword
has created a much much bigger margin for my occasional errors.
