    It's all due to early healing. Have a cleric go to Sebilis and throw a
heal as early as they do in PoV, then try and sit immediately (as so many
do). That green frog will try to whack them just as much as that level 62
golem. Well, depending on the heal they will - CH aggro is determined
relative to the mob, so you do get higher CH aggro off bigger mobs. But it's
not that much bigger - I can still pull a mob off a cleric that did CH with
two Supernal Remedies.

    It also looks like they're getting pounded on more because the hits
actually hurt. In Sebilis I'd offtank stuff until the ENC wondered why my
health was slowly sliding downwards. In PoV, the mobs are doing serious
damage so you notice when your cleric is under attack a lot more. There's
also more self-healing by clerics, which leads to more aggro.

    Last night we did Xanamech, to get flagged for PoI factory. The raid was
really sloppy and zergish, and at one point a whole load of mobs started
slowly killing people. I targetted one person I knew would likely get aggro
(ENC), healed once with SR, then started running a tight circle to kite the
mobs. If I saw someone getting pounded on for some reason, I'd run a wider
circle and get enough distance between me and the horde to SR (which usually
got the aggro back). I'd never done raid crowd control before! ;-)
