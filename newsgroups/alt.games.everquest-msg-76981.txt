Why I use EZBoard:

- I don't code.  I have and pay for a website but it's a basic service
(free, any number of pages, but one banner, no pop-ups).  As far as I know
it doesn't support another webboard that I could buy/steal/whatever...I'm
not a web admin.

- I keep in touch with quite a few other guilds, and they all use EZboard.
EZBoard provides a "Control Center," a quick & easy place to put all your
favorite boards.  Yeah, so is the Favorites folder in IE but it's just not
as handy (unless I'm doing something wrong)

- Costs $10/mo for my site.  No software maintenance is required by me.  No
DNS issues, no server issues for me to contend with.  To me it's worth it.
To a web admin geek the story is quite different.
