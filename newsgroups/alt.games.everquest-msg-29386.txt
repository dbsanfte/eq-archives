 Here is where the loot code defenders usually break in and say the
reason nobody is in Warrens is because it's so far out of the way and
not because of the loot code. I'd say that's about half true. But what
about zones that are a little easier to get to and are still deserted?
Nurga anyone? Droga? Stepping up a notch we have Kaesora. Other than
fang camping there's not much traffic here. Step ouside and you have
Emerald Jungle. You may see a few people in there at once. City of Mist
is empty a lot on my server. Chardok? Another fairly empty zone other
than for raids and maybe two groups but we can't really consider that
since nothing is really green there even at 60. The point is that even
existing zones without loot code are underutilized. In my opinion the
loot coding only makes it worse. Again, who are these rules supposed to
be helping when I don't see this as much of a problem now? With two
expansions presently out and another on the way, why change things now?
