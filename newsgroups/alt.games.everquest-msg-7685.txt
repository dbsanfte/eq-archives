Yup, I do the same too.  Pretty neat to remember the fear I had in the swamp
killing froglocks (or running from them)... and now I can bash em en masse.

I also try and take a screenshot or two for each level that kinda shows what
I concentrated on at the time.  Interesting to look back thru those and
remember your groups, deaths, kills etc. at each stop along the way.
