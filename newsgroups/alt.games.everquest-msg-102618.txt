I've collect the first past of the quest and will shortly be heading to
Freeport for the second part of the quest.  I know to avoid the guards and
to use the wall entrance to get into the underground to see Bondl Felligan.
My question is what is the best way to do this and since I have little
faction built up in FP will the underground folks KOS my Iksar.  If they
will KOS me, can I use Invis to get by them to get too Bondl?
Will Bondl KOS me, for the second part of the quest?  After I follow him
should I cast invis and proceed to the room with the Lesser Spirit?
If invis doesn't work will Superior Camouflage work?
Any other helpful hint that you could advise this young hatchling with would
also be appreciated.  Thanks again all.

Frederick J.
