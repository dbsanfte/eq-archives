Pfft, slightly alarmist.  Look at it this way:  You pay 30% tax, the other 
guy pays 30% tax, and that business pays 30% tax.  So everyone has 30% 
less money (well, except the government... :) )  Now, what effect do you 
think that has on the prices of things you buy?  There's no point trying 
to sell things at such a high price that your customers can't afford to 
pay it, so naturally, you pay 30% less, that business pays its providers 
30% less, and presto, he can afford to open that branch in another town 
anyway.  

As far as it not being worth it to work, 70% of X+1 dollars will always be 
70 cents more than 70% of X dollars.  And if welfare pays more than your 
after-tax income, you're either in the wrong field, or you're a grad 
student. :)

Zinphandel <-- In that second category... Just another year or so though.
