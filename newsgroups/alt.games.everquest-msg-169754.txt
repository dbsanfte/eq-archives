I mean, what about it?  Is it a good place to hunt post 50 ( EXP, loot, 
fun, etc.. )?  I'll be hitting 50 as soon as I decide to spend a few hours 
doing it and would like to see some new places.  I got my Seb, HS, and 6th 
floor ToFS key this weekend and put the Seb and ToFS key on the ring, but 
was a little hesitant to put the KS key on there.

First thing I did was go to EQAtlas to pull up the map and I see that it's 
a 50+ zone.  Below that I read that there are some undeads waiting to eat 
me when I zone in.  I didn't want to test whether IVU would work on them, 
so I didn't try to get the key on the ring since I didn't have a support 
team going with me, then.

Do people on your server EXP there?  What level is a good one to start 
going in there?  The people in my guild are always looking for new places 
to go and this may be a possibility if I can get a couple of them out of 
Seb for a few nights.

Will we get eaten on the zone-in?  If we don't have a porter, will the non-
gaters have a hard time getting to the zone-out?

We went into Kedge this weekend and really liked the fact that it was a 
nice, empty zone.  I never hear anyone talking about HS, so this may be 
another we will enjoy.
