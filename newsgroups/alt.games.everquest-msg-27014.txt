I know that.  Who said I gave up the pursuit of happiness??  I knew when I
made that post that it was a mistake to try and explain my situation.  I
said I have a hard time with women and I deal with it.  How does that mean
I've sworn off all contact whatsoever with them or that I've given up
looking for happiness?  Contact with women is a necessary part of everyone's
life merely by virtue of the fact that women are 51% of the human race, and
there are myriad things in the world -- women included -- that offer chances
for happiness.  Besides, bad looks involve eye contact, which is Step One.
It's acknowledgement.  Being completely ignored would be much worse.

I think it's good to know where I stand.  Look at the guy in that "asian
prince" post a little further down.  Not only is he a complete fool, but he
also has no idea what a fool he is.  Self-delusion is ultimately harmful.
My acknowledging that I have trouble with women is like a compulsive gambler
acknowledging that he's addicted.  It doesn't solve the problem, but it does
set straight in a person's mind the fact that a problem needs to be solved.
Furthermore, the acknowledgement of a problem does NOT indicate that the
associated behavior needs to be stopped completely, only that the approach
is wrong.

Also it is not necessary to be the best.  If you like swimming, you don't
quit it just because you'll never win an Olympic medal in breaststroke.  If
you like women, you don't quit them just because you'll never win an Olympic
medal in breaststroke...

Say nothing of the sort until we've traded places for a week.  My cards are
on the table, now you put your money where your mouth is, Casanova.

The Look I described is a BAD thing, not to be striven for.  If you want to
answer my posts, that's great, but pay more attention, because I shall
gleefully shred any ill-conceived notions.

...and it's spelled Shotokan.  I have earned a black belt in it.  This is
one of the things that makes me happy.
