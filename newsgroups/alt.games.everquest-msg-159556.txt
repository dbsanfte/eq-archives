I am not aware of any Paladin discipline that's worth much.

So instead of starting out going to challenging raids, group with
friends who know what you're up to.  You know as well as anybody
that the single most important thing is being eager to learn.  As
long as the people you are with know who/what you are and accept
that I don't see how it could be a problem.

Aha!  So it <is> all about <you>!!  (j/k)
Whatever you do, I'd recommend making the decision based purely
on how much fun you think you'd have.
