Cancel magic works on most spell effects other than disease, poison,
and curses. Buffs, debuffs, roots, DoTs(other than the previous
mentioned types), whatever. However, I do beleive it cancels in order
that the effects were placed on you - in other words, if you already
had buffs on you before the root, you'd have to cancel all the buffs
before getting to the root. Better off waiting for the root to fade...
