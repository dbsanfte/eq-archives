I am on Stormhammer at the moment but avoided the main GM events due to the
first one I saw in West Commons turning into a 100 mob central train
station... I have been in EK since then, which is sort of a non-GM event
zone atm, and managed to snag a Flameweaver for my level 30 bard so am
happy. It is the best item I have manged to pick up personally so far in
EQ - but that sort of measures my ineptness more than anything else. 3 more
levels and it will start proccing as well. : )
