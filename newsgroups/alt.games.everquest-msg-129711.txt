are you just saying that becuase the U.S. (U.S. corporations) and Isreal are
at the top of their list of human-rights violaters?
"AI condemns the Palestineians almost as much as they do Isreal" given that
is true.. that's more than what you've admitted to already!!!
anything is a human rights violation?  now what significant claim of their's
would you cite as a ridiculous one?

but i'm sure their corporate owners will definitely want the news skewed to
their best interests as well as the interests of their corporate partners.
example - elizabeth smart.  is she the only child kidnapped and missing in
this country?  what if she was Black and working class (as is the case with
another girl missing for twice as long, but never mentioned)?  that was the
question brought up by CNN's (i think its CNN) Aaron Brown - one of the few
good reporters on TV.  Smart is causasion and lives in a million-dollar
home... much like the people who probably own these stations (their
interests) .  back to the palestinian topic, when a concrete
argument/evidence is brought up against the isrealis, it is regarded as
"liberal propaganda" and it is completely ignored even when the presenter of
this evidence cited his sources on the air!!!!  he repeatedly said, on air,
that no one has to believe a word he say - all they have to do is
investigate his sources!  that's already more than the reporters have
done!!!  this was the case on Fox News and this is the program you just
mentioned!!!  with all this mentioned, this is your news source?!
hahahahahahahaha
