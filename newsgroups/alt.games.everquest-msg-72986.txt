Not to mention that it raises the spectre of the newsgroup going back
to the way it was when Verant did officially monitor it. 2/3 of the
posts were titled "VERANT READ THIS!!!" or "BRAD READ THIS!!!"  and
contained whiney diatribes about skills that players thought their
classes should have or "CRAFT3D ARMER L00KS GHEY! FIXX IT 0R I'M
QUITTING."
