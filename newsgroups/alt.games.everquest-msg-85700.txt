I have seen comments occasionally asserting that Enchanters should 
sometimes use their AE Stuns to deal with multiple adds because they are 
  relatively lo agro, and I was wondering if this is a special property 
of these particular spells?
As a Paladin I find myself routinely using single-target Stuns 
specificly because they seem to generate a _lot_ of agro, even on mobs 
that ignore stun results (most giants, for example).  I find quick 
casting Stuns to be great for peeling mobs off non-tanks and the 
occassional over-enthusiastic warrior, especially in messy fights with 
lots of mobs and difficult crowd control.

thanks for any insight,
- Kaev
