Hmm, an intriguing possibility. I don't know if charms are affected by this
spell or not. It seems that they would...they are considered normal pets by
all standards I know of.

1. Enchanter changes into non-KOS form
2. Enchanter heads into dungeon and charms target
3. Mage CoH the enchanter back to the top
4. Enchanter summons companion on his charm
5. Charm breaks, party beats the snot out of mob.

Dunno how really useful that would be, but I imagine there is SOMEWHERE it
could be done well.
