As a 60 SK, getting these was pretty easy.

Yesterday afternoon, I had some time to play, but was waiting for my 
wife to get done with a project, at which point we had to go pick 
something up at a friends house.  This meant I couldn't really group as 
I'd be sure to abandon people on short notice.  So I decided to work on 
Giant faction (separate post) and when that was done, since I was right 
next to WL, went to start hunting drops for the shackles.

I peeked at the Wuoshi area first, something the guild can be convinced 
to form up and do on short notice, no luck, but there was a holgresh 
conjurer.  I pulled him over, and made fairly short work of him, my pet 
finished off his pet while I was looting.  No branch.  I moved across WL 
looking for more, and slew a few, before reaching the Holgresh caves. 
The other types of Holgresh proved no more challenge than the conjurer 
had, despite some panicky notes on Alakhazam about the Elementalists; at 
level 60 none of them were serious threats individually.

Working into the cave, I didn't have any of the problem reported on Ala' 
about not being able to cast, not that I'd have needed to... but inside 
I reached a room of about a dozen of the things, seemed like a bit much 
since even at 60 they seemed to have a pretty good aggro range for 
adding.  I went back out and looked for more roamers.

What with the trees and so on, this was a little annoying with no track, 
but I did find them.. .and eventually ended up fighting 4 at one time. 
I had some trouble here, I actually had to do some lifetapping to stay 
afloat, and at one point gave chase to a runner and lost my pet, who 
stayed behind fighting a couple of the others; he's not really tank 
material.  Came back, finished off the other two, looted up and found my 
strong branch.

One bad thing about the new Rest system; when you become dependant on 
it, you really miss it; I was Malaised, which takes quite a while to 
wear off, and as long as you have any negative buff on, you don't go 
into rest mode!  Imagine if it had been Rabies or some other really long 
duration disease/poison/debuff (rabies is 122 minutes I think!)

Anyway, I recast my pet, recovered my hp/mana pools, and then went off 
for Tigerraptors.

These proved to be a pain, they wouldn't add when pulled but were very 
apt to do so if a runner got near them while fleeing.  Worse, their 
repop time was long, so I had to hit the jungle floor looking for 
roamers and dealing with chromdrac-like adds.  Of course, being 
buffless, the latter weren't much trouble, but they might be an 
unpleasant experience for someone doing this quest as a buffed up level 
30something.

I ended up logging out finally, and when I logged back in later to a 
full respawn, one of the four static tigerraptors dropped the guts.  I 
also killed what looked like a named, Rapticon, but he dropped nothing 
but raptor meat.

Off to Iceclad, where (after quick consultation with the guild) I hailed 
fisher gnolls till I found the correct one (his reply has to do with the 
  curse), handed him my branch and guts, killed the walrus that spawned, 
hailed the agitated snowfang which spawned, got chapter P, ran that to 
Ami who gave me the manual (very funny reading) and spawned a walrus for 
no reason, took that to the Chef (another walrus) and got the shackles.

Thus far I've clicked them a few times just for laughs, but haven't 
actually tried to see if they interrupt casting as some have suggested. 
  They are a nice boost to my AC, HP, and other stats, though, and will 
certainly do till something better comes along.

Berg, 60 SK, Shackled
