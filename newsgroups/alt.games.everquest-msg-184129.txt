Had a problem with my router.

Basically everquest uses a random port between 1028-5000 to send UDP packets
to your machine.

If these ports aren't forwarded to the computer you are playing EQ on, then
EQ will disconnect.

A real pain in the ass forwarding all those ports, but when i did, no more
disconnecting :)
