I concede the distinction.  However, my point in mentioning it is to
illustrate that the USS Liberty was a military vessel.  So it is
misleading to paint it otherwise.

You do not know that for a fact.  I do not either.  As neither of us
was there.

However, the fact that it had the potential is sufficient to make it a
legitimate target.

I don't view either attack as an "atrocity".  However that is a
subjective term and your interpretation of it is as valid as anyone
else's, including mine.

I maintain that there were legitimate military reasons for both
attacks 

As an American, I am outraged by both attacks.  As a dispassionate
objective observer with many years of military experience under my
belt, I see the logic of the attacks.

Again, we have a different definition of atrocity.

This is true.  Perhaps Israel felt that such warnings were not
necessary as the US would know enough to stay away.  I don't know.

But to compare the USS Liberty to justify the acts of terrorism
committed by the Palestinians is so far a stretch as to be outside the
realm of logic.  Now, I know it was not you who made the comparison,
but that is how this tangent got started.

Now THIS I agree with.  Even if the USS Liberty was going to blow the
Israelis stragety, once the ship was rendered inop, the threat was
ended.  I can only conclude that it was the Israeli's intention to
cover up the incident by leaving no survivors.  At this point the
military justification ended.

But again, I am constrained to point out that this doesn't meet the
criteria required to be labeled terrorism.

You are speaking of the laws of the sea, etc etc etc..

Yes, in a perfect world, you would be correct.  But you fail to take
into account the Israeli mindset and the Israeli paranoia.

Your reasoning does in fact, make sense.  If there was a message
processing station that the Israeli's had reason to believe was
passing on info to their enemies, it WOULD have been a legitimate
target.

You must understand, I am speaking from a strict military perspective,
w/o regard to treaty and other peace-time niceties.

Let me put it this way...

Let's say that there was a Russian LP outside the Afghanistan "war
zone" but well within the area to listen and spy on US Operations.
Let's further postulate that the US had indications that the Russians
were buddying up to AL Qaeda...

The US would be perfectly justified to take out that LP. Even though
it would violate a plethora of International Treaties and Laws.. It
would still be a legitimate military target.

Just as the USS Liberty was.

Don't get my wrong.. As I said, as an American, I am outraged.

As a military man, I can understand the acts..
