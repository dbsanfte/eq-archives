    IIRC PoI is a little bitch of a place to feign pull. It's quite time
consuming and because you're only dealing with a series of double pulls your
reward is an eventual handfull of single pulls that you must constantly pull
without a rest or you will get repops. It's also really easy to get them out
of sequence due to a second group's presence and end up with adds popping
behind you.

    I hated it, but early 50's for a group of normal people (ie not twinks)
it's probably hard to beat for accessable experience.

    The twinks on the other hand, seem to like lfg in PoV at 55... which I
find faintly offensive ;)
