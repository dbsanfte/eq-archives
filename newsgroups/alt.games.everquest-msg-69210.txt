Crazy idea occured to me last night, but ny little druid (who's been
relegated
to pretty much nothing but porter for my friends anyway) hasn't bothered
getting the new spells.

What if they stack?

An -additional- 55% movement reduction that stacks with the main line,
heck, you'd be using that spell all the way up to 60.

I'm sure it doesn't... but what if?
