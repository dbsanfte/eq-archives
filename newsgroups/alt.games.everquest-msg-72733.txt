Thats all well and good.  Having a Necromancer as your main can be a lot of
fun I'm not saying it isn't.
If you haven't gotten your resists gear yet you may want to focus on that
for a while.  Your resists gear will come before your int gear on many
raids.

I agree, I love my Necromancer, he's my main, untwinked.

Necromancers are one of the best in a group, if, played correctly and if
your group members understand that your role.

Naw, we can try and sometimes do replace the "tasks" performed by other
classes but most of the time we not able to "replace the special abilities
of essential classes".  we are a poor substitue that when played well can
"add value to a group most people never knew we had the ability to add."
