For the record?  You're a damn good bard.  I have never had a complaint
about you. :)  You're on my list too, and creeping up on poor lyrral, bah,
smithing has taken way too much of my time...  I think I still have some
items for you if you want them :)  Have to dig them out of whatever alt I
put them on.
