Hi All;

My rig has the same memory, 512 PC2100.  The heaviest usage I do is EQ. All
other software is just work related and doesn't demand a lot out of my rig.
Is it worth it to go to 1g of RAM for EQ? Will this cache more levels or
other info that will benefit the game?? I have all effects on high and don't
seem to have any problems. Game plays fine (other than occasional lag in
some zones).

AMD 2000xp 512 PC2100 WinXP(Home), Geforce3 vid 64/meg, SBLive, cable
connect.

Thanks in advance for your time.
