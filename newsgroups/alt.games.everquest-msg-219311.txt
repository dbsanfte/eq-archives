Depends. When you're playing beastlord as mainbuffer/healer (even if
its just spot 2k heals on pet) I found medding for mana was more
productive - pet, dots and <additional> (for me it was a druid, not
a ranger), were more than capable of killing the mobs. It was keeping
mana coming that was an issue.

Am I missing something about beasties? (Beastlord was level 65, but
not my character so I dont claim to be overly familiar)
