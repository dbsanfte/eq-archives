At low lvls, you have it covered pretty well. Pull with a DoT, melee
it down, then use Inner Fire to heal yourself up after combat. If you
get in trouble, use Flash of Light, step back till the mob runs away
and heal yourself till it comes back. Once you get decent dots and
root, you can try root kiting instead. 

You'll never get a good enough pet where it can tank mobs well. At
higher levels you'll either be tanking for your pet or root-dot it if
it hits too hard to tank. Shaman melee at higher levels not to do
damage but to soak up the hits while your pet and DoTs kill the mob.
