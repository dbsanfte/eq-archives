Well, your problem is that you feel that you must have that bind before you
venture out to play.  I never felt that way.  I ask, if I get a bind, great,
if I don't, I go out and play anyway.  Sometimes I die, and sometimes that
means a long CR, just another adventure.  Sometimes, while exploring with my
shaman I forget to rebind, and guess what, sometimes I die, and that means a
long CR.  Of course, now with the Nexus portals, that can significantly
reduce the length of the CR at times.
