It's a possibility, sure, but the specific reason that the doors
were unlocked in the first place was because he had already had
to replace several other convertible tops when the car had been
burglarized before via roof-slitting (while parked in varying locations),
so he decided to just leave no valuables in the car and leave it unlocked.

Once might be vandalism, but several point to a standard burglary
technique.

Also, there are far better ways to vandalize a Corvette than to
just slit the roof up above the interior door release.
