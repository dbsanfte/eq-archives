around what level are your characters? I played a new beastlord solo
till 25 and got bored. I think I would get more groups if I where in
the 40's or so.

As far as joining guilds, most of the ones that I'd be interested in
have a requirement of the amount of time you play or minimum level
character and or a guild member must sponsor you.
