Heh.  The coolest piece of female clothing I ever saw in-game was in this
Sega CD (yeah, I bought the system, I got suckered, it could have happened
to anyone, okay?) game called Vay.  The warrior woman had a torso armor
called Leather Teddy.  It was pretty good armor, too.  I guess guys were too
busy staring to swing at her.
