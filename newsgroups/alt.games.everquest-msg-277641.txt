How does what somebody on a different server affect you?  If they keep
this on two servers, hopefully new and away from the current ones, it
might be a good thing over all.  If those new servers attract the
people that spend money for items or plat away from the current
servers, the plat farmer's market dries up.  If there is no market,
they won't be there.  Maybe servers will drop from several plat farmer
teams down to one.  That is a good thing.

As far as competition... anybody could buy what they wanted before.
Hopefully, buy corraling the market on two servers that I couldn't care
less about, competition will be increased on normal servers.
