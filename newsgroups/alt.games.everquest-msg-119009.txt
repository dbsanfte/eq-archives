The PH is a wandering priest spawn. You go in from feeroot I think,
one in RM you turn the first left and go straight. The wandering
priest spawn is often there or wandering around elsewhere, he seems to
spawn thereabouts I think. Its like "an orc priest" on track. My druid
has killed him a few times while doing other stuff there, never had
the axe orc guy spawn. The stuff he drops now is not really very good
in the current game so its not worth bothering that much.
