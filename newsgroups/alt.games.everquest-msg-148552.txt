 Correct. You can run this standalone, so no network connection required
once you have it configured properly. It's not really detectable unless
Verant does a drive scan. And we all know what happened last time they
tried that.

 Easiest thing to do is create another directory, copy everything over
there and use that to play around in. Or, like you said, on another PC
if you really want to be safe.
