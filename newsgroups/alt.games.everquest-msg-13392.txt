I think Verant's stance is that you are taking advantage of a "dumb" AI.
For a broad (and not 100% accurate) way of saying it, if what you are doing
would NOT work on a person of moderate inteligence, then you shouldn't do it
against a Mob.  Of course, there are exceptions, for example all forms of
Agro management.

Imagine that the GM took control of the Mino.  Would he turn around and walk
the path when you backed up?  No, he'd go beat your brains in.  So, that
would be an exploit.  If the GM was in command of the 3rd Warder, he likely
would go down and take care of the clerics, but that is where the line gets
real fuzzy b/c agro control is an OK way to out-think the AI.  Now, if they
(Conquest) were using some trick to make it so that even if the cleric was
at the top of the hate list, and it couldn't summon or reach them, then its
an exploit, b/c its no longer simple agro control.

Basically since even the best real time AI that can be given to the mobs can
not come anywhere close to the deductive power of a person, Verant has given
them special abilities.  Walk through walls, hit at any Z-axis difference,
not drown, not get hurt from falling, not get hurt from lava, etc...
However, even with all of these advantages, players can stil out-smart the
AI by taking advantage of its predictable behavior (such as the path in your
case).  It seems that the only acceptable means of out-witting the mob is
agro control, be it FD, Evade, Taunt, or whatever.

I think that sums up your question as I understood it.  Please note, I am
NOT affiliated with VI, and don't claim to be able to read their minds, but
from what I've seen/read/done, this appears to be their policy in a nutshell
