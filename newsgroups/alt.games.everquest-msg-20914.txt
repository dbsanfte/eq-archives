It's my understanding that Win2k has a problem with 3-d sound in EQ, no
matter what card you use.  Now, if you turn off acceleration completely,
thereby making your $100 card a $15 card, I HEAR you no longer get the
stuttering.  Then again, you may not hear that giant tiptoeing up to you,
either.

Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.  I dumped Win2k for EQ before I
heard of this so-called "fix," and as much as I LOVE Win2k I'm not going
back to it if it means crappy sound (either stuttering or no 3d).
