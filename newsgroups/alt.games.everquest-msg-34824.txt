You will not evade me, "Brat" <brat@portalofevil.com>:

Yes, you are.

As opposed to your own wonderfully creative name? (And didn't I just
see you complain because someone judged characters in game by the
stupidity of their names?) 

She hasn't even started flaming. I also can't see that she changed any
consonants anywhere, but I do notice your grasp on vowels doesn't
appear to be too tight.

As for her being a fucking noob: her sex life is none of your
business.

Does it really offend your fragile little feelings THIS much to be
called on the unoriginality of trying to call Lokari a hall monitor?

>School yard insults...ROFL...pretty ironic coming from the people who's sole

I don't think hall monitor classifies as an office or building site
insult.

As you should.

>you're reminiscent of a schoolyard bully...only you're not the

*snicker*
It's fun watching you thrash, you know - you use the same tired,
immature phrase as an attempted flame after half a dozen others have
used it, only to proceed to throw more schoolyard comparisons at the
people laughing at you... and then you top it off with a description
so perfectly fitting your own inane flame attempts it HAS to be
karmic.

And all this time I thought lazymatt (did I change enough consonants
and vowels for you?) was a poor excuse for a flamer wannabe...
