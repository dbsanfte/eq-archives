> 1. Which one do i get and Why???? THe original or the expansions

  You need the original to play the expansions.  The expansions are worth
getting if you continue to play EQ, but if you're not sure you'll get into
playing EQ, you may want to hold off on buying them.  If you keep playing,
eventually you'll probably want them all.

  I don't think the Trilogy pack is that expensive anymore though, compared
to the cost of just the original game.  The Trilogy pack comes with the
original game, plus two of the three expansions that have been released
(Kunark and Velious.)

> 2. I live in Sydney Australia. Is there any local servers to exist on??

  None yet.
