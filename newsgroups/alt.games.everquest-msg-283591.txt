Well it at least suggests some answers, and is indeed interesting 
reading, but its pretty clear that they don't really have definative 
answers either... and that dev minds have waffled back and forth on many 
of the issues.

I'm literally shocked at this omission.  And not in a sarcastic or 
ironic way either.  The newbie armor quests are a great addition to the 
game, and don't have anything to do with any expansions.  Further, by 
the time whatever expansion they're suggesting unlocks those quests is 
opened, nobody is going to be at all interested in the newbie armor; its 
only useful at start of server!

Hardly a surprise.  But they may still be benefitting from the same 
effect that the melee are; in a group, where pets are rarely the MT, 
they should do a good deal more damage on those soft targets, its just 
that since they have lost AC, they are getting the crap kicked out of 
them by the mobs when they try and "tank".

I also wouldn't have done this one, I'd have gone the opposite 
direction; not shared bank, but rather One Character Per Account; FV has 
been working that way since inception, and it really helps get people to 
play their character rather than just play the game.  I'm not talking 
hardcore role play, but just getting attached to their selection of 
class and race and what they've been thru.

But thats just me.
