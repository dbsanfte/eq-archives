The few times I have grouped with a necro, I have loved it.  Even if all
they are doing is being a mana battery.  I have partnered with a necro a few
times with my warrior, and it was great, he kept me at full hp all the time,
we never took a med break, it rocked.  I would always be happy to group with
a good necro.  The problem that people perceive I suspect, is that many
necros solo a lot, because, frankly, they can.  This means that they don't
learn good grouping skills.  A good necro is awesome to have in a group, a
solo necro is not an asset to a group, and that is probably where the
problem arises.
