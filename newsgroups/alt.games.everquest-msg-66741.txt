I recently quit DAoC and came back to EQ. Trust me on this one, stay with EQ
and give Mythic some time to get their act together, the game still have
some serious issues. Don't get me wrong, DAoC is a great game with a bunch
of potential, but the balancing and content isn't doesn't even come close to
EQ. With Kunark, Velious, and Lucin combined EQ easily have 10 times the
content in terms of quality and quantity. If you play DAoC now you're
basically paying to beta test for Mythic.
