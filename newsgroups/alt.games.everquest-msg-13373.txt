Just because one class has a particular spell doesn't mean it's the
class-defining ability.  Big deal, enchanters can charm.  So can bards and
druids (at the very least).  Not as well, but considering charm is less
reliable than root, the limitations on their use of the spell is not a big
deal.

The only abilities that can possibly be considered "class defining" in a
game that promotes grouping (and REQUIRES grouping later in most situations)
MUST be an ability that's used in grouping on a regular basis.

Charming is but a minor tool in crowd control at later levels.  You use it
when you can't mez something...the mana it costs to charm/recharm (when
you're fighting blues at 40+ you ARE going to have to recharm unless the
other critter goes down FAST) is prohibitive (Allure, level 49 charm, 245
mana; Dazzle, level 25 mez, 125 mana).  The casting time is prohibitive
(Allure, level 49, 6 seconds.  Mez, 2.5 seconds).

You're talking about cute little xp groups, of which I STILL take part in
many.  There's LOTS of ways to play EQ...but just because you CAN do
something doesn't mean it's class defining.  A wizard who uses AE at level
40+ with an enchanter in the group is a wizard who will find it damned hard
to continue finding groups.  People who piss off enchanters on purpose
aren't very bright.

But your scenario doesn't work in dungeons to any great degree, and that's
where you go to do serious hunting.

A class defining ability in a group-based game must be group-based.  AE
damage spells are outdoor soloing or cute xp group spells.

Of course.  Charm is a tool.  One of those allen wrenches that most people
use only rarely.

Then here's a hint for higher levels.  Unless you've also got a necro or
magician...and know how to CONTROL it (besides just saying /pet attack,
because that doesn't even come close to understanding and controlling pets),
and I'm betting you don't, your pet will only cause you to die, again and
again.

It's bad enough when a magician or necro can't time their pet commands when
you're trying to mez the critter the pet is beating on, but an enchanter
with no experience with REAL control experience is a useless enchanter.

You are fighting one critter.  You get 3 adds.  You AE mez and are far
enough away or lucky enough not to mez yourself AND lucky enough not to get
any resists.
You charm one, and when the 3 wake up, 2 come after you.
Your charmed one starts engaging one of the 2 adds that are left, and is NOT
/assisting the main tank.
At some point you mez one of the adds.  Let's assume you're lucky and you
mez the one your pet is NOT attacking

What's left is your pet beating on the critter.  Let's continue to be very
generous and say the critter is beating on the pet and not you.
What do you do?  Continuing with my generosity let's say you know how to
control your pet.  You know how to get him to quit hitting the critter.

How do you do 2 things at the exact same time?  More specifically, how do
you get your pet to stop fighting, and mez the critter before he re-aggros
your pet?  It's possible, but a royal pain in the ass.

I don't consider that very smart.  It's certainly not mana efficient at all.
You'd be smart to learn really early on that group members don't know
ANYTHING about your powers.  All they know is that YOU are the one that
makes it possible to fight just one critter at a time.   HOW you do it is up
to you, but don't slow them down by being OOM at the end of the fight when
other options were available that would leave you at 50% mana (and almost as
importantly, the healer with more mana).

The best way to handle adds that can be mezzed is...oddly enough...by
MEZZING them.  It's cheap as hell, and when the tanks and casters start
whining for enchanter buffs you KNOW how much time you have left and can
cast the spell when possible.  And funny thing is...you may just have mana
to cast them.

In most outdoor situations when you come across an add that can't be mezzed
I've found the best solution is root-parking them.  Root is more reliable.
Indoors, yes, if they're blue, attempt to charm them if they can't be
mezzed.  If you can't charm them (either resists or the soon-to-be problem
of OOM) get the tanks to switch targets and mez the original target
(assuming the original target is mezzable and not near death...if it is,
don't worry about being beat on for a bit).

Another tip.  I've yet to come across a critter who cannot be mezzed, but
CAN be stunned.  This has nothing to do with our debate, but figured you'd
like to know since you haven't really come across them yet (I think you said
you're below level 20).

No more than charm is.  Bards can mez.  I think necros can.  That's it.
The difference is that charm is primarily an outdoors option.  Mezzing is
the dungeon option.  Outdoors is for soloers and small groups (in most
cases).  Dungeons are for full/near full  groups.

Why would you base a "class defining ability" on a primarily outdoor/solo
tactic when that's NOT what EQ is about?

I know a bad enchanter in the post 40 game when I see one.
I know that there are a hell of a lot of options for enchanters.  I
regularly use pages 1 - 25 in my spell book, depending on situation (another
tip, spell book organization is probably most important for enchanters).

I know how to do crowd control and I'm better at it than ANY other class at
ANY level, assuming my spells can stick.  I'm going to go out on a limb and
say that I'm at least as good as 75% or more of enchanters on my server.

I use MANY different tools to do my job.  You've got charm on the brain as
some excellent tool.  It's not...it's mediocre at best.  NECESSARY
sometimes, but that doesn't make it great, and it certainly doesn't make it
"class defining."
