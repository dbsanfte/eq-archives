Can you give other examples of buff style haste stacking?  As far as I know
only bard "overhaste" songs stack with normal haste buffs, so it would seem
to me it would take unique coding to make this haste stack with alacrity.

Of course if bard songs like Battlecry of the Vah Shir are slot 4 haste (or
heck, any slot but slot one) and all other hastes are slot one haste, then
that would be a strong arguement in favor.

Better still for proof would be a log parsing which shows more attacks per
minute with SQ plus Alacrity than with just Alacrity, since its hard to
argue with success.

I don't really know how stacking works based on the "slot" system anyway.
Your breakdown shows SQ with something in slot 4 and HOS with something
else in slot 4, since they aren't the same thing they can stack?  What
about that slot 6-8 part you show; STR and DEX are only two items, but 6-8
would be 3 slots, whats up with that?
