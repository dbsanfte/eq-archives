The XP difference won't be much.  Let's look at two groups of 4: one that
has 3 55's and a 46, and one that has 3 55's and a 65.  In the first group,
the 55's each get 26.1% XP on a kill, and the 46 gets 21.8%.

In the second group, the 55's each get 23.4% of the XP, and the 65 gets
28.3%.

However, the 65 will make it harder to find things that are still blue to
the group, so might reduce the group experience noticably that way.
