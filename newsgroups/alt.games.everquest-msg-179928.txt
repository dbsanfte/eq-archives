I have a question about two quests I found on Allakazam's today that would
be rather useful for me to do with my Mage.

Lynuga's Gem Collection
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=264
Says you talk to a wandering female troll NPC in Innothule and hand her a
ruby and if you're lucky you get this earring that would be an awesome
upgrade for me.  Anyway, after the revamp of Grobb (those slimy frog
bastards) anyone happen to know if this NPC is still around, or if perhaps
she has been moved to Neriak?

Merri's Artifact Collection
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2199
Just like all of the other Fine Antique items, basically I collect 4 items
and turn them in combined in a collector's box.  My question is it states
that this is doable at level 30.  Can I do this solo or would I need to take
friends for the 4 camps?  Results in a Range Slot Item that has Extended
Range II and 5 INT so would love to attempt it.

Thanks for any advice or help.
