\> Where can I get the imbue fire opal spell?

After naggy the dragon dies in solusek eye a merchant will spawn there . He
sells among other things the imbue fire opal spell . He spawns some
considerable length of time after naggy dies . He is used up in a quest to
spawn ragefire for the cleric epic weapon . Usually there are several
diffrent people camping his spawn for the cleric epic . chances are that
after he spawns you will have a very limited amount of time to use him
before he dies. If you can find someone admittting to camping the spawn ask
them to buy you a scroll .
