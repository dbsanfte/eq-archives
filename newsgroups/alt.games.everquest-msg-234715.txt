(legal disclaimer I am not a member of the bar ! this is my interpretation
and do no use any such as advice on how to do anything !)

If an author said you where not allowed to read a book to your children
would that also be legal? Thats half of the legal argument (fair use)

The other half is kinda weird . The law has an absurd number of protections
protecting someones rights to employment. For instance A contract that says
if you leave this job you may not find another job in this field for a
period of X years is a fairly common contract term. This is generally found
to be unenforceable. A contract that forces you to accept outside
arbitration away from the legal system has just been found to be
unenforceable. The right to work and earn money is one of those rights you
can not sign away in a contract.

My interpretation would then be its a fair use to sell your time in another
companies game and that that right of employment can not be signed or
arbitrated away. Further banning someones account produces direct harm to
them and for most of us that harm would be minor but to someone getting his
employment that way would constitute a direct financial harm that could be
recovered.

I do not think Sony would just lose, I think they would have to financially
compensate anyone they banned for their time spent in game. This is exactly
why I doubt it will ever go to trial . I could easily see a suit for direct
dammages to be on the order of 5000 hours times $20 an hour as just direct
dammages.

People who use such services are pretty easy to spot, just stay away from
them. They are essentially paying extra money to not play the game and as
such are fairly pitiable. The net effect on the rest of us should be minor
at best.
