I would most certainly add it to the FAQ. I've known about audio triggers, 
but never used them before. This just sparked some interest to try them 
out. I'll start with my own simple and cheesy recorded audio clips, but I'd 
like to find some nice, short appropriate sound bites online someplace. We 
should post links here to any we might come across.

Thanks for your efforts.
