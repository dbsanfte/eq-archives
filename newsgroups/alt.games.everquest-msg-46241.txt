No, they don't. There are very few modern agents that are defeated by only a
gas mask. All of the nerve agents will kill through skin contact, which
would be the most likely agents used in a chemical attack. If you're serious
about this, you need a mask, a MOPP suit, and somewhere to go to get
decontaminated before you find it necessary to eat or shit. Good luck
finding one!

Not like you're going to have much warning, anyway.
