you need 4 things.

Mistmoore -- after going into the cave left of the graveyard, there is a
chasm to on the right
side, literally 200 feet below the castle bridge. There are about 6-7 spawns
down there, which
can be pulled in 3 different fights. Enynti is the mob to kill and is easy
to kill at 35, but
doesn't always drop the rune of fortune so you may have to kill her a few
times... quick spawn
though. There are several new shaman epic quest wolves that are all red, but
don't aggro... just
don't use an AE spell near them :)

Upper guk -- Find room with 3 skinny bridges and a lot of spiders after the
slippery corridor is
some water and an underground room that is tricky to find. Inside is a necro
with pet and the
skeletal monk with a mask. Pretty easy at 35 again, but safer with 2 ppl.

Qeynos -- Near the one of the docks, find Madame Serena. As a high elf,
giving her 50gp resulted
in a get lost... so I turned into a human and used benevolence and tried
again and got another
rune of fortune.

Neriak -- go to library and give the guy that sells the enchant metal spells
50gp and you have
the 3rd rune of fortune.

Take them all to the temple to finish the quest. The mask is very nice!
======================================================
any way to Multi quest this? are the runes no drop? is the mask no drop?
basically i want to do this quest with my monk or wizard but they cant get
into Neriak. only my girlfriends enchanter can.  but the enchanter is only
24 and cant do the guk or mistmoore part.
