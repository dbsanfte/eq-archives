You mean the place where there are boxes which you'll get drawn
and quartered if you look at them funny while anyone else is in
the zone, even if you are a 65 rogue with maxed traps skills and
uber traps items... because they come in "int caster" and "wis
caster" flavors as well, and all of them are an absolute craps
shoot even =with= the "best odds" setup, and tend to kill
everyone in your group if you even think about checking one for
traps... absolutely hands off during the mission, pretty much
hands off after the mission.  If you want to stay and solo the
traps, thats cool, but since there's only a one in three chance
its your kind of trap that won't get you far either.  And
finally, unless they changed things with the recent patch,
apparantly for the most part the boxes have junk anyway.

Or do you mean the normal floor traps which have effects so
minimal that they are no more than a mild nuisance, and since
speed is of the essence, nobody wants to wait for you to check
and potentially disarm them?

Oh, and if thats not enough, note that Bards have the same skills
with much lower caps, helping to prevent usefullness.
