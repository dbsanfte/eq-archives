Whoa, slow down there a bit slappy

Yes, we all jumped on her over this post too, but if you followed the 
thread a bit before piling on, you'd see that she meant the ability to 
re-invis yourself while on the move, NOT the initial invis as you get 
ready to cross a dangerous area.

Cloudy Potion, instant cast, 11pp or so with charisma.

There are other solutions, but any moderately high level cleric that 
doesn't have a few of these on hand is in the "expecting to be baby 
footed around" category, or worse, since the cleric is the only person 
who actually has to get to the destination alive in order to get the 
group there.

Bergh Brelltender, 65 cleric, Morel Thule

oh wait, there -is- an alternate solution

Splendid One, 56 COTH mage, Firiona Vie

not to mention necromancer and paladins, but still, you get my point
