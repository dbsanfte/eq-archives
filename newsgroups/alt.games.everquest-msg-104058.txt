Hi all,

I've made it to level 11.  Level 10 song rocks.  With the haste and my
iceclaw, I trounce baby kodiaks and scarabs!

After reading about burned woods I figured I would share my a funny
happening yesterday.  I was in misty thicket and some guy (I'm not sure what
class but real high, he was wearing a robe but kicking like a monk) was
killing the halfling guards by the wall.  I asked him if I could loot a
corpse since he was just leaving them and I got a squad ring.  Cool.
Anyway, I see a bard running from a goblin and a wolf.  I killed the goblin
for him and the high level guy killed the wolf.  I knew he was a bard
because I could see the Selo's effect.  He came back and I conned him, light
blue to my then, I think, level 9.  He gives the dead goblin a rude gesture
and comes over to me.  I guess he conned me and then he inspected me.  He is
seriously twinked.  He has that neat looking armor that covers the face and
looks almost cat like. He had the full suit.  He says, "Can I get a buffer?"
After giggling a minute, I said "Sorry.  I can't do that."  He didn't say
anything but just stood there staring at me (I had Selo's running).  Finally
I said "I'm a bard."  He was quiet for a minute and then "heh. Oh yeah. Me
too."  He waved and ran off.  I was dying.  Easily amused I guess.

Just a note on how high the guy killing the guards was: He went after 3
guards.  One only got a single hit before dying.  The other 2 were beating
feet very soon after.

Lewis
