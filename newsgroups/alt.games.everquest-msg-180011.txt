The argument I was making was that the raid tool being PoP only in no
way "forced" anyone to buy the expansion. It's a damn nice feature,
yes, but I also know that you can get to 60 without bothering with
raids, and I also know you can enjoy the game just fine post-50
without raiding if that's your thing. If someone feels that they
*have* to raid to have fun in EQ, then that's their choice. If the
"raiding guilds" aren't taking people without PoP, that's their
choice. Nobody at SOE twisted anyone's arm to make these decisions.

Of course, then again, a good number of the major "raid guilds" I've
seen don't take anyone under 61 anyway...
