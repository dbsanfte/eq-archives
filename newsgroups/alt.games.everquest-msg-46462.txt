Recent examples:  One group I had a total of 40 or so Str buffs but my stabs
were barely higher (nodal went from 154 to, I think, 157).  Last night I had
wolf form with 40 ATK and my stabs went way up, max from 261 to 281.  This
has been confirmed as being more vital by the Safehouse vets over the course
of time.

That's why I actually *like* the change in Evade done a few months back.  It
give me the control on where I am on the list.

Granted, there's not much I can do about over-nuking casters but when
there's one tank and me, and the cleric states that he's healing the tank, I
can expect that he'll take a big leap in agro.  I need to be ready to *let*
the mob spin on me so that the tank doesn't get finished off before the
heal, and doesn't pulpify the cleric for doing his job well.  Same for when
I hear the druid getting snare resists or the 'chanter getting mezzed
resists.  I'm the buffer.  That's agro management.
Sure, I let the odd caster get a smack when I know he's just wasting mana =)
but I won't do it on a caster that's doing his job.
"Each class has to manage their own aggro" doesn't always work when there's
resists, etc.  You can't expect the chanter to stop trying to mez because
'there'll be too much agro' but you can be ready to keep yourself on the
agro list above them.
