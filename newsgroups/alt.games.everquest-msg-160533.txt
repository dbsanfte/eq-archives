Well my friend's cousin's sister's uncle decided to try the EQW/VNC
trick and it actually works, the only problem he is experiencing is that
the mouse works very badly.  Originally, he though would be happy just
being able to chat, but since he's actually in the game, he was
wondering if there was anything he could actually accomplish without
having mouse control.  There is too much lag to actually be in a group
and again, lack of mouse control rules out tradeskills.  Any ideas or is
he just stuck chatting?
