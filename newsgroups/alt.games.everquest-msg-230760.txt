Yep, the mana regen on raids is so crazy that its pointless to use this dot,
may as well use one of your real ones if you are going to.

This is kind of my point, yes epics are outdated by many items.  But some
more than others, my brothers 65 cleric wields his epic, we know that there
is better, but he will  have that for some time, and it outclasses almost
(everything?) buyable, as goes for alot of epics.

For the pure +30atk there is barely anything to replace the rangers epic.
