No clue, I'd never buy or sell an account.

If you start from level 1 it'll take you about 2 weeks to get to 60 if 
you play with friends and have any time to invest and you'll learn more 
about the game than you forgot first time around.

When you log into the game as a purchased level 70 cleric and someone 
says 'hey dude come to DSH farm' and you say 'where is DSH farm?' and 
they say 'in SoF man!' and you say 'what's SoF?' they may just stop 
sending you tells (of course, if they say 'in SoF Man' you might be 
happy for them to stop talking to you, ymmv).

BTW: My spell checker decided that Rezen should be Lozenge, which I 
found humorous.
