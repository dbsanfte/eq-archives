You have to remember how different level 10 is now for the real newbie.
For anyone who has played a char over 30 levels 1-9 seem trivial.
For someone who only started the game this week levels 1-9 are normal
and level 10 is a nighmare.

Level one can be done with less than 10 kills.
Level 10 is going to take over 30.

Hows that for a hell level ?
