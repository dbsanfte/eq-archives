Even without a pet meandering, pets often caused adds because
they were much lower level than the party members.

For any given bunch of mobs, it seems there's a critical
breakpoint where above a certain level, the mobs won't
"chain assist" each other, and below that level they'll
swarm all over you.

It seemed to work out that party members were often
above the threshhold, and the pet(s) would be below it.
Spawn a pet and start a train...
