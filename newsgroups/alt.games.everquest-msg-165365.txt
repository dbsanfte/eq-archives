Nit picking:  I can't recall a time when the BSOF would've been
considered "excellent" by anybody capable of making a meaningful
contribution to a Lucan kill.  And Soulfire sightings were very
rare even when the quest was fairly new, there were some better
weapons out there, and if you could get Soulfire you could get
one of them.  Keep in mind that back in the days when Soulfire's
numbers weren't outright laughable there was no extra damage
bonus for 2H weapons, they got the same bonus as any other
primary hand weapon and so were far less effective than fast 1H
weapons.
