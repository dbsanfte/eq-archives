    Divine Light is your Superior Heal replacement. Depending on how fast a
Kleenex class (INT casters, so named for their armour) is being killed, you
may want to cast Divine Light over Remedy. The HPS (healing per second) of
Divine Light being chain-cast is higher than Remedy, so you can get ahead of
the mobs rather than fighting the losing fight chain-casting Remedy. Divine
Light is also better when I want to forget about someone - cast a Remedy on
a shaman who is tanking a mob while trying to slow, and he may need another
before the slow lands. Cast Divine Light, and I know he's safe enough that I
can start a CHeal on the main tank.

    BTW, am I the only cleric that thinks "healed enough, I can forget about
him" when multiple people are being hit? :-)
