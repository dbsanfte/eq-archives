What you can do now is use the "/doability" command to call for a sequence
of skill. Max 5 actions / commands can be set under one hotkey.

(I use a motor to rotate a plastic arm which keep hitting the mouse button,
so when I am AFK, as long as my mouse cursor point at correct hot key, I
keep practice my programmed skill.)
