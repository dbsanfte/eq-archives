Please clarify.

I'm aware that -my- dispell isn't random, and strips top down. 

And I'm aware that once upon a time, mobs worked exactly the same way. 
But I was under the impression that this had been changed with a patch a 
long time ago, such that AE dispells were still top down, but targeted 
dispells are random.

Is that incorrect? Was it correct at one point, but been changed back? 

FWIW I could have sworn cleric ldon mobs have been removing buffs at 
random. (definately not top down).

Or is there a more complex pattern they now use, not top down, but not 
random either??
