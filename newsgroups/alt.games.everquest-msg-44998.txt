Well, wont do much for you, the sites i tried before removing it again was danish sites. They all worked fine
in the various versions of IE, NS 4.x, but on NS 6.x the menu didnt work (some java stuff that made 2 menus
you could swithc between like the normal windows menus where you can switch between the different parts of
the menu). That didnt work, so couldnt access the forum, which was the parts of the site i used most.
It couldnt use the biggest danish search engine.
It STILL had the java problems the earlier versions had. (the one where some java code that "lock" the
browser, so the sites dont load, you cant use left mouse button. can only be solved when first closing NS
then using Task Manager to close the EXTRA running instance of NS).
It had severe problems handling ASP sites, just like the 4.x versions (the 4.x can be excused, since ASP
wasnt developed when it was released, but 6.x should be able to run it)
It crashed as much as the old 4.x versions.

To summarize.
IE 6.x = fairly stable, used by almost everyone, might not support all standards, or MS trying to get their
own standards to work instead. But it works. Can view all sites that are not deliberately made not to be
viewed. Ignore standard HTML errors, which make it one of the worst testing tools in the history of HTML

NS 4.x = Old, dont support the newest standards, crashes a lot. Can view most sites, problems only exist when
site have buggy HTML code or use technology that are newer than NS 4.x. Some problems with certain Java codes

NS 6.0 = Browse faster than both IE and former versions (gotta give them that, its fast, but LONG startup
time). Supports most new standards, but still have embaressing problems with Java codes. Dont handle ASP good
enough. Crashes even more than earlier version. Of the sites i managed to see the 2 hours i used it, it
viewed 10% of the sites different from layout in IE, NS 4.x, or site didnt work at all).
Ignore some standard HTML errors, but not as many as IE, so no guarantee it can view sites only tested in IE.
When importing bookmarks from earlier versions it make 2 of every entry, and generally make bookmarks a
nusiace to work with.
SERIOUS problems with installer, never managed to get in installed from their (notso)SmartUpdate. Had to get
the full install file from FTP.


Mozilla (only tried one version, cant remember version number, around 3 months ago. Cant say that much about
it, didnt give it the "standard use day" test i did in NS 6.x) = Netscape layout, so NS users will feel at
home. Not at stable as IE; but a lot better than NS.
SERIOUS problem with pictures. Totally unreliable when reading online cartoons (hey, read around 10 daily),
if more than 1 picture (jpg) there are NO guarantee it show all the pictures, not even which ones it show,
seems totally random. Tried to get www.sluggy.com (one of the sunday strips) to work for 45 min before
stopping. Then tried www.brunothebandit.com and had similiar problems.
Removed both Mozilla and NS and reinstalled Mozilla only. Still same problems, the removed it.
Can confuse users not used to open source technology, that are not used to being listened to.

Why? You defend your favorite browser, i defend mine. I listed the different browser problems above, and my
experiences with the browser make me use NS, since its my personal favorite (was SO dissapointed over NS 6,
had looked forward to it for 6 months), and use IE for the pages NS cant view.

Hmm, would love to see your stats page for it.
