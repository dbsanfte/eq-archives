It never ceases to amaze me.

<mini-rant>

So last night I rolled up a Gnome Wizzy. 140 peeps in Steamfont. Oh
Joy. I expected it but it's still no fun to deal with.

After taking me 30 minutes to ding 2 (where 30 minutes on any other server
I would expect to be hitting 3) I decided to log until the morning. Was
much easier, only 45 in zone. You could actually hunt.

What amazed me was the absolute lunacy I saw going on around me.
Everyone's broke, no one's twinked - yet corpses loaded with what can only
be called "trash" were left to rot. I promptly robbed every one that I
could. What amazed me even more was the complete lack of knowledge about
the numerous newbie quests available... I reached this conclusion after
looting almost a dozen Infected Rat Livers (10 to a a Mage trainer earns
exp/faction/cloth armor) On countless other corpses I got away clean with
pelts, rat paws... anything that earned me more than a copper I looted.

Logged off for the morning a level 3 wizzy 3/5ths of the way to 4th with 2
plat in the bank - more than enough to buy my level 4 spells when I
ding. I honestly wonder what these others are thinking? Do they expect the
money they need for their gear/spells to just magically fall from the
sky? Can I expect these same players to start whining in another level or
two complaining that they can't afford their next rank of spells?

Gah!
