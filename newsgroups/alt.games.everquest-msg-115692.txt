I  know what ya mean...I before I had luclin, I spent the majority of my
time on boats.  Sometimes when they zone in, especially at qeynos and
freeport, they "freeze."

You can see the boat just sitting there while standing on the dock, turned
just a bit, and it will sit there for a loooooooooooooong time before
moving.  Often times, if you are on the boat, it is faster(and good way to
raise swimming) by jumping off the boat as soon as it zones in and swimming
to the dock.
