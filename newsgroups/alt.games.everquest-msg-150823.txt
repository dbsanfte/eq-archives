Five killed in Norfolk bank robbery

    

NORFOLK, Neb. (AP) - Five people were killed in a bank robbery Thursday
and authorities were searching for three men last seen in a white 2003
Subaru vehicle with in-transit stickers.

Four employees and a customer were shot in the robbery shortly before 9
a.m. CDT at a U.S. Bank branch off U.S. Highway 81 near the center of the
city, Police Chief Bill Mizner said.

A sixth person, a woman, was treated for a gunshot wound to the shoulder
and was released, said Jaque Genovese, a spokeswoman for Faith Regional
Health Services in Norfolk. It was not immediately known if she was a bank
employee or a customer. The woman was transported by ambulance from the
bank.

"They killed everyone in the bank, and then it looks like they shot their
way out through the doors," said Shellee Honcik, an accountant who was
working next door in a Burger King restaurant at the time.

Authorities were searching for the three men who fled the bank on foot and
then broke into a nearby house where they stole the getaway vehicle,
Mizner said.

Mizner described the suspects as Hispanics wearing dark clothing and baggy
pants. He said had no other immediate details on their descriptions.

The FBI was called in to help with the investigation.

"We are trying to determine what happened. We're hoping security tapes
will help explain that," Mizner said.

Windows in the bank were shot out. The drive-thru window at the nearby
Burger King was shattered by a stray bullet. No one was at the drive-thru
window at the time, and no one in the restaurant was injured, Honcik said.
She said there were about 12 customers and eight employees in the Burger
King at the time.

"Everyone started screaming when the window shattered," Honcik said.
"We're all still in shock."

Schools in the city were locked down as police searched for the suspects.
Only students escorted by their parents were allowed to step outside
school buildings, Norfolk Schools Superintendent Randy Nelson said.

Banks in surrounding communities locked their front doors to customers,
but kept drive-thru windows open.

"Everyone is just a little nervous," said Barb Rabe, clerk for the city of
Wisner, about 30 miles southeast of Norfolk.

Rainy weather was preventing the State Patrol from using its helicopter
and three planes in the search.

"They are standing by if the weather clears up enough," said State Patrol
spokeswoman Terri Teuber.

The patrol, which has a troop headquarters in Norfolk, was pulling in
officers from other areas of the state to help, Teuber said.

"We're doing everything we can to find these suspects," she said.

Gov. Mike Johanns planned to fly to Norfolk later Thursday to survey the
situation and see what other assistance the state could provide.

Other than at the Burger King, people at other neighboring businesses
including a law office and car parts store said they hear no gunfire or
saw anything suspicious until police cars started to arrive at the scene.

Norfolk, with a farming community of about 25,000 people, is about 90
miles northwest of Omaha.
