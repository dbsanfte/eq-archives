Dear God, I pray that you would bring another plague that is even more
obvious in it's impact, so that people would learn to fear you and turn from
their wickedness. I understand that when you plague someone it doesn't
necessarily mean you don't like them, but that you just want them to notice
you.

In Jesus' name
Amen
