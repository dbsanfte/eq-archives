I wouldnt say that article points to the fact that they dont 'care' about EQ
players, maybe not individually, but for sure as a collective. After all,
without players EverQuest is nothing <pictures a lifeless Norrath...spooky>.
What it does say is simply that they did not care about what the potential
players thought the game should be, and this is understandable. What does
Gamer_01 know about programming a game? what can and cannot be achieved with
the code? and im sure plenty of the makers play EQ so in a sense the game was
created by players.
I do however think that Kelly Flock used a very poor choice of words to explain
this and came across as being arrogant and rude.
