I know this is going to be taken the wrong way, but...

KEI doesn't cost 50pp a shot.  Enchanters who sell it in the Nexus or
PoK are more than willing to accept anything over 5pp, and maybe even
less than that.  Once they've got that spell, casting it is pure
profit. (And I think the "mana is free" argument actually applies here
(for once) because I'm talking about enchanters who are doing nothing
but hanging out in the Nexus or PoK casting KEI over and over and over
again)

Giving them 50pp or more is courtesy.

A cleric casting BoA can't afford that for long.  An enchanter who
gets 2pp for a KEI doesn't make much from it, but a cleric who casts
BoA for that much loses money.
