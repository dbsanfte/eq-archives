I have.. and all but flame come down to just learning the event. Flame
took a bit of work due to the AE's. But most aren't any harder than
execution and feature nearly the same setup, just a different
structured room. Execution was the one that was always done because it
was so easy to tell people what needed to be done. The mobs pop middle
room... 4 waves and then boss.

But an example of differences, torture. You have to go around to the
back side where stairs lead into the room... 4 mobs per wave pop at
once, 2 from left hallway, 2 from right hallway. When you clear wave
wraith pops in room down stairs.. kill it for Hp/mana regen boost,
rewash. 4 of these waves and then boss pops where wraith did. Only
difference between it and execution is where you fight and how they
come at you plus the wraith for hp/mana boost.

Currently flagged for 7th hammer. Not like i'll ever get the chance to
do him. It was more a matter of pride and boredom that I got the
flags. I don't like not having keys to anything.

It just takes getting in and learning the setup. Once you do that,
everything but flame is really no harder.
