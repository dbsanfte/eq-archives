I can't say for sure about that, most people that I have encountered have
LDoN, but then again most people I associate w/ in game have been playing
since 1999 and are addicts.  Seriously though I see an awful lot of people
w/ LDoN in their LFG description and VERY VERY VERY few w/o it.  It makes
sense (especially at level 20+) to have LDoN as it allows you w/ the
purchase of points to get some very decent gear (unless you are a twink
already).  And, it really doesn't take long at all to get to 20 anymore.
