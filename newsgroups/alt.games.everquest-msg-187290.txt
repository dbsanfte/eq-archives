Come  on DT, an online translator. sigh. Kahir is Hasan.
Kahir is in old Farsi and is formal. The reason some "online
translator" came up with nothing is because it's a name not a thing.
go back and type Felipe and see if you get Phillip in a spanish one.
You won't get any results back.

And it's Embarrassing not emberassing but then again I'm the stupid
one right..
