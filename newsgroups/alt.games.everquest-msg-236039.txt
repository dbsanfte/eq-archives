So why are we arguing about it here.  Just let him be petitioned or petition
him yourself if seeing the word Chronic for a few seconds on your screen
bothers you that much.  I dont have any problem with it even if he named

myself but hell if someone is that immature I want them named like that so I
dont accidentally group with them.
