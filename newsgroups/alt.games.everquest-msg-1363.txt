The problem a lot of people have is that they want the GM to do something
that they can't do.

They died because of linkdeath and want a res.

They put the rare items into an oven instead of a forge, and want them
restored.

They got in trouble deep inside a dungeon, died, and want their corpse
fetched and ressed.

They dropped an item on the ground and an NPC picked it up, and want it
back.

They went AFK for a minute and came back to find themselves dead, and want
to be summoned to their corpses and ressed.

They were in an unfamiliar zone, fell off a cliff and died, and want a res.

Stuff like that.

It's obvious that these types of requests just aren't going to get granted. 
That doesn't mean don't ask.  What it means is that sometimes the answer
you'll get is "no", and to accept that.
