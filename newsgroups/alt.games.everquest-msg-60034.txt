    /frown. They had a slower/healer and a crowd control/mana
acceleration/slow regen person and they REQUIRED a cleric? /boggle - I'd
have said with the shaman and bard they had all the healing they needed, and
didn't even really require you, let alone a cleric. /shrug

    "Other than that"? Was the bard low-level? Usually, one bard is more
than sufficient for crowd control on the floor - you usually can't *find*
enough mobs to overload a bard's mezzing capacity!

>Did I mention we didn't have a warrior at all for most of the evening?

    Warriors aren't required for any sort of XP grind. Someone with a taunt
button and a plate class AC is sufficient, and in many cases in Velk's even
a chain tank's AC is good enough (depends on whether slowing/crowd control
is available or not).
