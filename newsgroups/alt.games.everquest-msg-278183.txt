Good idea, I'll feedback it also.

I also don't like being unable to tell whether a vendor is "full".
I.e., if I sell something there, will it be available to repurchase?
I sometimes sell stacks of water or bat wings and buy them back to
convert 200 cp into 2 gp, but that doesn't work if the vendor's full.
(Which, contrary to an earlier post in this thread, DOES happen a lot,
especially in high-traffic areas after the server's been up for over
a week.)

The other problem I've seen mentioned is that there's a big fat BUY
button, but no DONE button.  You have to click the little X or hit
ESC to close the window.  (Or move far enough away.)  I saw someone
bitching that he had ended up clicking BUY when he was trying to
close the window.
