I would try first taking it back to WalMart and telling them that the key
has been used and the software is worthless without it.  They are usually
very good about making exchanges.

To my shame I have to say I was recently tempted to "steal" a keycode
myself.  I have just installed Luclin and needed another copy for a second
computer.  I went to Walmart and there on the shelf was an opened copy of
Luclin. Sure was tempting, but I didn't do it.
