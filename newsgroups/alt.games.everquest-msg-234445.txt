I dont stick to a "all one class" format but I do form all pet class groups
sometimes.
I am a 65 beastlord with paragon and my 65% slow, my most recent group had 3
necro's and 2 mages with me, I get my group together for the courtyard area
in BoT killing stormriders. I pull with slow and once I send my pet in,
thats the cue for the rest of the group to send theirs in. stormriders live
for about 30-40 seconds on up to a minute if they manage to get a heal off.
my pet keeps agro the whole time due to the hate modifier on his proc and I
have to heal my pet on avg once per battle.

Between my paragon and the necro's casting mind wrack on them mana is
*never* a problem. I also have spot healing powers of about 500-550 hp (up
to 1k crit) for when things go wrong, and necros can also share their hp and
then tap the mob, altho things rarely go wrong in the courtyard I got that
strategy DOWN. heh.



Benefits

Beastlords slow, heal, buff, have a 2200 (base) pet heal, beastlord pets
keep agro over other pets
Necro's mindwrack, can manafeed others, can snare and root
Mage's have a high dps pet that can snare or root when needed, can also
malosinia mobs to lower resists
The courtyard area can be single pulled, even by a beastlord, every time.
Overwhelming DPS.

Downsides
No chanter for kei/voq when it drops (usefull if you arent in an area where
the mobs are all casters, otherwise just get the necros to mindwrack)
No cleric for hp buffs or rezzes in the event something actually does go
wrong (such as someone training.. only happened once in that area, but hey.
it happens)
If a stormrider(or whatever mob you are fighting) resists your slow, it can
do quite a bit of damage to you before you finally get it to land, even with
the protective spirit discipline engaged.

Notes
DoT's are a BAD idea for this, stick to direct damage and the pets. dots
steal agro away from a beastlord warder so fast it isnt even funny.
if you play a pet class that can root and you are in one of these groups..
if the mob starts chasing the beastlord.. root it. if the bst has to cast
slow too many times he never will lose agro.
