The reason a lot of people back the EULA on this particular matter is
because people who buy high-end characters and high-end gear using RL
cash are often in a position to get other player's characters killed
and wind up wasting a lot of people's time in trying to recover from
their incompetence.

Outside of RL sales, EQ is a kind of meritocracy. You get out of it
what you put into it. EBaying ruins that.
