The only puslings that weren't white at 60 were the Greater ones.

White con means equal level.

Ergo, all puslings that aren't greater puslings, are level 60.

It is certainly possible that they spawn with an hp amount variance,
however, also consider that your parses may have been missing other people's
hits/nukes, or if you were soloing them (I assume bow kiting?) the pathing
in the zone in room is atrocious, and there are some spots that they can get
stuck and lose agro and regen fast, sucks when they enrage and then gain 20%
hp.
