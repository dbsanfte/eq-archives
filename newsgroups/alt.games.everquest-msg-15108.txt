>Hehe, I didn't arrive in LOIO until 22.  So far I have done:
>Oasis : 14-17 - 2 days
>Highpass : 17-20 - 3 days
>SK Aviaks : 20-22 - 1 day
>LOIO Sarnark Fort : 22-25 - 5 days (died 6 times first day ;))
>SK Spire/HK WR Room : 25-26 1 day

I was at least 24 (probably higher) before setting foot on Kunark the
first time I played. Went to LOIO, got a group at fort, found it to be
full of trains and not appreciable exp for my level, left after an
hour and never returned.
This time, I headed to Kunark at 27. Got a friend to port me to DL,
ran to Overthere, got bound, hunted a short while with a friend's
group, went back to SK spires where I'd been since 23, took another
jaunt in OT at 28, did some more hunting at spires, went back to OT at
29 when I got Greater Healing and stayed there till I dinged 38. 

No character of mine will ever spend time in LOIO if I can help it.
