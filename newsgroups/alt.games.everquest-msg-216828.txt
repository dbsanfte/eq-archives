Well, opinions on my intelligence vary wildly. Usually depends if I've
waved a pointed stick in your direction lately.

I'm certainly a bit rusty at playing my druid, having not played at
all for eight months, but I'm sure I'm no slouch. Even if I was,
there's no way another player could know that before hand, and even
then it doesn't excuse the ignorant behavior I've seen displayed in my
attempts to form an LDoN group.
