Aego plus BAOR = 84 AC 1400 HP
POTG plus Aegism plus Marzin = 59 AC 1150 HP
same mana regen.

You tell me which You would rather have were you capable of the
choice?

No cleric in his right mind is going to take POTG over BAOR plus
Aego... or for that matter BAOR plus HB (which is actually same
HP and one more AC.. but the duration is much lower and the
mana cost is higher)

While a Druid might prefer POTC/G, its not a matter of comparing
POTC to BAOR or to HB, BAOR stacks with HB while
POTC prevents both.  Since druids have no option to self buff
plus take HB (or Aego) they have to make that choice... and
since HP and AC aren't really important druid stats anyway
the choice is clear, mana regen > all other stats a druid can have.

I"m not conversant with other class' stacking issues, but I've heard
similar comments from other class', that HB plus their own self
buff is superior to POTG alone.

Further I put it to you that BAOR feels like more mana regen
than POTG.  I'd been told that it was twice the mana flow...
but I can't prove that it is, and Castersrealm definately states
that the two are the same.  They also claim POTC is self only,
though, so there may be some room for error in there....
