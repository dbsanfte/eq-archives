I passed the Woe and Envy point a couple months ago, but I am thinking about
helping a friend get the "easy" parts for his epic.  I don't recall if Glaron
the Wicked give Truespirit faction when you kill him.  If I help (e.g. heal,
slow, nuke, dot) during the fight for Woe & Envy will that boost my faction up
too high?  I have completed all the steps up to the Hole in order, so I don't
want a kindly, non-exploitive act, screwing my faction for this new bug which
has popped up.
