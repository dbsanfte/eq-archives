MPII won't save you on some of your better spells, and getting less 
usefull the more you level... but you do still use quite a few it will 
be good on.  The ER II is one of the few effects that Will work on CHeal 
(ER III will too, mind you, but I mean ER in general, and it happens 
that CHeal will fit in the II level focus effects).

How about looking for drop ones?

AA is a bigger project than you may imagine; you need 6 AA in the first 
tier before gaining access to second tier.  First tier doesn't have much 
of use, really, other than the superlative Run skill, definately get 
that, and then probably regen 3 unless you want to be a GM in more than 
one trade skill.  After that (and on reaching level 56) you can buy the 
better AA's.  Its debatable whether they are really worth buying before 
you level up, as the higher your level the easier each AA will be to buy.

Ranger puller with a warrior MA is a bad plan on many levels.  Firstly, 
whoever pulls gets aggro for it.  Warrior wants aggro, ranger doesnt'... 
so this is wrong just to begin with.  Second, ranger is going OOM... and 
yet is voluntarily missing out on the brief medding intervals between 
pulls if she's off pulling (same arguement I used concerning your being 
luller and constantly OOM)  Thirdly, indoors rangers don't particularly 
have any specialized pulling tools, you'd be no worse off with a mage 
puller... no  you'd be better off as the mage could use an eye to scout 
ahead for mobs behind doors and such.  Warrior doesn't use mana and 
wants all the aggro he can get and is better able to handle accidental 
overpull until they get mezzed.  Snare pulling isn't a great plan 
either, why make the mobs come to you slower and spend mana on them and 
generate more aggro?  Cancel magic or something very low aggro like that 
, or a well placed arrow, which would cost no mana... snare after the 
warrior has the mob really angry at him and it will do no harm, you 
dont' need the mob moving slowly until after it arrives in camp.  But 
the warrior could put an arrow in the mob just as easily as a ranger.

I hope the ranger wasn't taunting, that at least is unlikely.  Using one 
weapon is a common ranger tactic when faced with getting too much aggro; 
use a big slow two hander, which generates less aggro than a pair of 
fast one handers.  Depending on the precise weaponry she may even do 
more damage that way... and is certainly going to be taking less riposte 
damage, if she's in front of the mob (which she shouldn't be with a 
warrior present).  One reason she may be having mana problems is the 
opposite of what you are thinking, she might be Jolting for all she's 
worth, which is a ranger spell which reduces her position on the hate 
list of the mob.  Jolting, using a two hander, not using her proc 
spell... there's a lot a ranger can do to not be the punching bag, but 
sadly it all also adds up to doing less than maximum possible damage.

Should be sooner on the ranger and later on the warrior, instead of the 
reverse.  Warrior has better mitigation and a bigger HP pool, so he 
takes damage more slowly.  Hit him at 10% and you may have 5 seconds 
leeway, hit the ranger at 20% and you may not have 3 seconds leeway. 
You shouldn't have to Cheal the ranger at all, in fact you shouldn't 
have to heal the ranger at all if everyone is being really good at their 
jobs.  Ranger taking a few hits here and there should be able to heal 
herself up or rely on druid's regen to take care of the problem slowly; 
actually healing the ranger means a mistake has been made somewhere.

In this group, its hard to say who the ML should be, I'd vote for the 
warrior, as the only person NOT desperate for mana.  Inability to ride a 
mount in LDoN means that anyone looting is missing out on desperately 
needed med time.

Chanter getting aggro isn't necessarily a bad thing, slow tends to do 
that and chanter needs to get hit to engage the animation pet anyway if 
thats the plan.  Once slow has landed and aggro is removed there 
shouldn't be any further trouble from that mob for the chanter, his 
nukes and dots (if the mob is living that long) really aren't bad aggro.

I can't think what the necro could be doing that would get him in 
trouble with even a warrior MA; casting too soon, stacking too much 
stuff on... but it shouldn't take long to figure out about what rate he 
can cast at and still let the MA keep the hate going.

My mage has done it before and knows how... but is rarely the best 
person for the job.  When the ranger volunteered, fine, test it out, but 
when she gets too much aggro one time after another, its time to try a 
different plan and see if it helps.

I was just in an LDoN group today where we had a similar situation: 
warrior and two SK, plus a beastlord, shaman and my mage.  Warrior 
wanted to be MA, and we let her try it.  It really wasn't going terribly 
badly, we were at least chewing thru the mobs reasonably fast.  After 
about 20 minutes though the warrior demanded that the shaman stop using 
stoicism on her.  We explained that there was no way to keep her alive 
in some of those pulls without it, as the other heals a shaman has to 
hand at 47 are too small to be of any real use... in fact when it got 
really bad the HOT was on and normal heals were stacked on top of that. 
When she continues to insist that she really can't keep aggro if she 
can't move (mind you, she's not complaining about the slow part, which 
can be a real problem for a warrior trying to keep aggro, but the 
snare!)  we move to one of the SK as MA.  SK can keep aggro while slowed 
due to the ability to cast spells instead of having to keep swinging and 
hoping for procs.  There's no further problem with using stoicism when 
required (its not all the time, when mana or speed isn't a problem 
normal heals suffice), and the other tanks stop taking part of the 
damage and spreading the shaman's efforts out.

I'm open to suggestions.  I'll let people try things that seem less than 
optimal.  Sometimes its actually better.  Sometimes its not quite as 
good, but more fun. But if it looks like it really isn't working out, 
sometimes you have to say "lets try it this other way and see if that 
helps with the problem".
