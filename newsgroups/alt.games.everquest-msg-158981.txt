    Heh. It SHOULD be, but the people on your server may have made it
unsafe. Many of the graveyards are right beside the zone-out, and people are
training them to try and escape. Plane of Innovation is the worst for this,
as there's a 900-damage hitting, AoE Blinding mob that can be trained there
with ease.

    Then go to all the older stuff that people aren't at. These new zones
are a nightmare of people too low level to be there training every which
way. The one zone that's at least safe to zone into is Plane of Justice -
click on the giant gold balance on the hill in Plane of Tranquility to get
there. Since you can Gate, getting out isn't an issue. Be careful - many
prison cells (when you're there, you'll know what I mean) contain KOS mobs.
