Ignore him.  :b

Depends on what class you are.  My baby ranger uses bind wounds all the
time.  It's far more efficient to bind up to 50, then sit and regain mana
and the rest of the hp, than it is to go oom healing 10 points at a time
with my crappy ranger heal.  And, ranger heals remain crappy throughout.
