In December of 2000, I bought EQ and The Ruind of Kunark (in one package). I
opened the box, and found a CLOTH map of the world.  When I started EQ, I
was treated to an *awesome* tutorial which helped immensely.

Nowadays, we get paper maps, and the tutorial doesn't even ship.  What
gives? The Cloth map alone made the world seem even more magical the first
time I stepped into it. Why don't they ship the coth map or the tutorial
anymore?

Thanks!
