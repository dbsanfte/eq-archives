Another (slow but) good quest is the orc pawn pick quest in EFP at 
Hallard's Resales. If you give one of the merchants (can't remember his 
name, it's the guy on the opposite side of the room from the entrance) four 
orc pawn picks he gives you some silver and several positive faction 
adjustments, but no negative ones. IIRC, it increases Coalition Of 
TradeFolk, Coalition Of Tradefolk Ill, and Knights Of Truth (This one goes 
up *very* slowly).

Great for increasing Knights Of Truth faction without killing your 
FreeportMilitia faction. Combine this quest with the Janam and Rebby quest 
and you can have good faction with both sets of guards, and excellent 
faction with the merchants.
