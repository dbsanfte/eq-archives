Nope :ï¿½/

Bind wound max'd at 19th is 100 (which is 25pnts per bind) This helps with
down time but if you are solo'ing you'll still be sitting around doing nada
for excessive amounts of time compared to if you grouped.
Bind wounds for all melee is max'd at 200 now (which i believe you can bind
up to 75% of your HP and not just 50%)

If  you are looking to solo for a while then the beetles in NK are an easy
source of exp at your level. They can hit pretty hard but are slow so easy
to out run if you are in trouble.

Hint on running, use mouse control (holding down right mouse button to
activate mouse look and left will make you move forward) when you need to
move quicker (when runnning away most things can keep up with you if you
have no SoW) press and hold down the forward and left or right arrow the
correct your direction with the mouse, you will now move at a faster a rate
(only slightly but it is enough to outrun mobs that aren't considered "fast"
in movement) add jumps to this and you should get away from most mobs. Of
course the down side to this is you need both hands so typing "Train to
<name> Zone" is a not any easy task.
