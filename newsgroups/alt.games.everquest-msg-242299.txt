Nah, I was soloing at the time, didn't matter if I had the new spells or not
right then. :) Besides, whenever I buy the new spells BEFORE I ding, it's
like a jinx or something, because then I end up getting killed a couple of
times just before making the spell level and end up taking far longer. :)

I used to do this, but honestly, it's just not that important that I have
that next line of spells to mem the second I ding, at least not to me. Now,
if I'm going to be grouped with a bunch of people I don't know, then I'd go
to the trouble of getting the spells before the ding, but since I mostly
group with a friend or solo, not that big of a deal most of the time. :)
