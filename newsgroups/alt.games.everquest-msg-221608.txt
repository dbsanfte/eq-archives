druids mostly just nuke so they usually dont get around to healing.
there is always a lot of deaths and downtime when druids are the sole
healer because when a heal is needed they are either in the middle of
a nuke or are oom from nuking too much. pretty much all druids do this
although there are some rare exceptions.

shaman have so many buffs to cast that when they do it on an all melee
group they are oom and have to med up. by the time they are fm the
buffs wear off. they can slow and haste so that helps with heals not
being as needed. they are preferable over a druid but if you want a
healer you gotta get a cleric.

rangers are like rogues with a bow. they arent tanks. my cleric goes
oom fast when a group thinks a ranger is a tank. a shaman would still
be a better choice when grouped with a ranger because of slow. shaman
should pull though because ranger will be dead by the time slow lands.

paladins, rangers, beastlords and necromancers arent healers even
though they do have heal spells.

a group of 6 monks with fungi tunics works out pretty well too.
