I looked up the AotIB on Everlore, and it is 16/37...

Most people I heard from in game said it's worth around 1000pp.  The
warrior in my group was really excited about it, and offered to trade
for it because it is 1hs.  I guess there are not too many 1hs weapons
with a damage that high in the mid-level price range?  I don't know, I
haven't played a melee class in years...he was pretty disappointed
when he found out it was pal/sk only.

In the meantime I gave it to my roommate's pally when he was 12th
level to use for a while.  Yesterday someone offered him 1200pp for
it, but of course he tells me this after the fact. :/  I told him he
could use it until I get back to Runnyeye and get another, or find out
a definate value for it, but I think it will be hard prying it from
his fingers when I decide to sell it.  He seems to have some sort of
attraction to it. :)
