I'm considering a reward to someone who can eliminate my link death problem.

Am running WinXP on a 2GHz Pentium 4 HP Pavilion.  I have 756MB ram and 64MB
video adapter
ram (Intel 82845G/GL/GE/PE/GV Graphics Controller), and have a DSL
connection.

I used to get lots of LDs when on dial-up modem.  When I first got the DSL
connection I did not have more than 2 LDs in the first 2 weeks.  Then I
started getting them twice a day approximately.  I have installed the usual
Windows updates and am not able to do a system restore back far enough to
check whether updates have had an impact, because I eliminated earlier
restore points due to confusing instructions by Microsoft.  (I was unable to
do any more system restores due to space allocation restrictions, so I tried
to eliminate prior restorations and ended up eliminating prior restoration
'points' instead).
