The wizard epic, as many know, is broken again. It requires a massively
higher faction for the same steps with the same mobs than it used to.
This has caused a lot of lost money, and in some cases, lost VERY rare
drops for folks working on their epics.

Last night, though it took most of the evening, I drove my Truespirit
faction up to Amiable, which was enough to talk to every mob on the
quest. In case you are wrestling with this issue, or even just worried
about it, here's how I did it:

Grab yourself a friendly enchanter and go to Butcherblock mountains. Go
to the bandit camp that is at the location marked #10 on the EQAtlas
map. That's where Pegleg the bandit is. Kill him and a wolf shaped ghost
spawns, called "A Minor Spirti" or maybe "Lesser Spirit".... something
like that. He should con apprehensive to start with if you are a wizard.

Have the enchanter charm him for you. Now he'll con amiable. When you
hail him, he'll ask you if you killed this man. Say yes. Then he'll ask
why and you tell him the guy was going to injure you. Then say, "Who are
you". He'll answer and give you the key phrase to say... "I wish to
learn more". (In fact, I think you can just say "I wish to learn more"
right off the bat, but I included the other text to be safe.) At that
point he'll give you a tiny gem.

Take you and the chanter to North Freeport, and down into the sewers,
which you enter near the Office of the People. Through a hole in the
wall you will find the Shammy epic mob, Bondl Felligan. (sp?) Bind
yourself and the chanter there. 

Give the tiny gem to Bondl, but don't hit trade yet. Have the chanter
invis you and *then* hit trade. This will give you a truespirit faction
bump. Port back to GFay and run to BB to Pegleg, rinse, repeat. 

In about eleven shots I got to indifferent. At that point, you don't
need the enchanter anymore, as the mobs will do business with you on
your own. Keep repeating the quest until you get to amiable. Took me
about two additional hours after I hit indifferent, and that was with a
couple breaks. You could probably do it faster.

This could also be of use to any shammies who may have screwed up their
faction with Truespirit somehow.

Hope this is of help to somebody.
