If she's willing to venture out of the fantasy RPG I'd like to suggest
Deus Ex (the original game, not the followup "Invisible War", which
was pretty poor).  DE had great depth, a lot of fun interaction with
various NPCs, lots of "side quests", and the choices you made
regarding your character skills and how you interacted with people had
a signifcant effect on the gameplay.  

What I enjoyed about it was that I'm not a "run and gun" type of
player, and it was quite possible to play it as a sneak and hide game.
The immersion in the game was probably the best I've had in any game,
including Everquest.  And the fact that you got to revisit some areas
and see changes that had occurred made it feel more like a living
world and less like you were simply moving from level to level.

The nice thing is that the game came out 3 or 4 years ago so it should
play comfortably on an older PC.  But I suppose it might be tough to
get nowadays.
