Take your highest hit (should be pretty common) and understand that defensive
takes off exactly 30 percent of the damage on each hit.  A mob that has a max
hit of 300 will have a 210 max hit during defensive.

As for how many enchanters.... 3 or 4 for an absolute minimum.  The more
wizards and rogues (and levels) that you have, the less you can get away with.
Considering what you said about the VSR force, might want to add a few more
than that even.   Have them set up a rune chain, the same way clerics do a CH
chain, so the rune is constantly getting renewed.

Everyone should have at least rune 3 on going in, and aggro control is a
*must*.

As for lifetapping mobs in general...  Just wait until you get big enough to
try Dracoliche.    VS lifetaps, proc'ed very often... full 1500... on a mob
that quads for 600 each.    I'll never forget our first (and so far only)
fight with him.   I had 5000 hp and rune 5 on.  He took me from that to 0 in
about 2.3 seconds.    (We did get him on the second try, but wow was that
tense, going in knowing and understanding what he can actually do.)
