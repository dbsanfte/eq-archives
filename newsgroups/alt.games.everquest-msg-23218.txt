Well, I'm a computer geek now.  I wasn't before.  Started in collections,
went to accounting, went to a branch (in other words, everything), went back
to collections, and now I'm a geek.

People hate collectors more than they do cops (which I think is probably a
good thing) but I tell ya what...you learn a lot about banking, human
nature, and listening to people.  It's an educational experience I'd
recommend to anyone.  You get to learn a couple big things; When is an
Answer Not an Answer ? and the most surprising, the vast majority of
"deadbeats" are nice folks in a bad jam.

Of course, it's the REAL deadbeat minority that makes the job fun...tracking
'em down, listening to them BS their way through the phone call, suing them,
subpoenaing them, garnishing their wages.

Talk about OT.
