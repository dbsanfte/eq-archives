Well for one, i have no idea who bait masterson is supposed to me a rip off
of. Secondly Wun Toque? The best i can think of is "one toke" which is a bit
far fetched.

Honestly the filter and policy is there to prevent names like mastaballz and
niggahkilla etc, who cares if it lets people have names like drizt or
leglas.
