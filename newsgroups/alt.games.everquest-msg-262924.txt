<SNIP>

I'd never log into it. I just recently started a new character on FV,
because the IMHO excessive use of the NO DROP flag was annoying me. It
makes no sense with the lore of the game. I'm not a big fan of
mudflation, but no drop is not the solution. It's like preventing
terrorism by restricting liberties Patriot-Act-style. You solve the
problem, by eliminating the abilities you had. That's not really a
solution. Trading items is (i think) an important part of the game,
and yes, if you hand a totally uber, non-level restricted weapong to a
newb, s/he should be doing insane damage and level accordingly.

A much better way to control mudflation in my opinion is to set the
lowest possibly price a particular item can go to, by having vendors
pay that much for it.

If a particular weapon can be sold to a vendor for 1000p, you'll never
end up finding it in the bazaar for 50p. It also removes high end
items from the game. The only side effect are players with more money,
which I don't think would be a problem, because a) this solution
scales up and b) players with more money causes inflation, which is in
support of what you are trying to prevent (mudflation).
