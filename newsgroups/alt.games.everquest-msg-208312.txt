Just using radius and having a clue, you can get them in 1-2's ("usually")
Pacify is the way to go though

I got my sinew the first day I went there for it.

This is just guesswork, but I'd have said 20kHP, and their melee damage is
pretty high (outside of pop)
Shrooms are in the maze before juggs, fairly high MR, some are clerics, some
warriors.

There are also undead frogs down there.

Cleric
Ranger
Shaman
1 of Bard/Enc
Another melee who can pass for a tank at a pass.
A PORTER!

Kills would be slow, chance of repop would be high, so having only 1 melee
there would be a pain to have the add pre-occupied (isnt that much room down
there)

Don't forget a way of getting out of there afterwards! 1 way door, and
particularly difficult zoneout before that
