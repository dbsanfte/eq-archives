Maxed with avatar, not just maxed with buffs.

Hmm maybe hoop+solstice, or hoop+mosq

AoW has taken care of CoV faction...  doze tho?  if im doing his quests,
I'll get my monk the finished items!!   Whenever ive done 2 group doze, we
were kindof wizard(DB) heavy - im not sure how a bunch of melees would work

Over 20k each on prexus.. seems a little excessive

My monk has those, I did originally plan to exp in droga for my pling.. but
it didnt happen.
Its a pain in the arse quest, not sure I can do it a second time!

19k I last saw it for..  if its for sale at 10, then again it seems kinda
excessive.  barbed ringmail is a shitload of AC and 50hp, and was like
4kpp..  why is tae ew so much better?

Again I think Doze is unrealistic..  if nothing else, those mains on the
list would sure want these items too.  But hey, maybe i can 1group+ bots do
doze..  the warrior isnt uber geared tho, which doesn't help.

Always.. but im not grouping with anybody atm other than like 3 set ppl

Well, barb gnome and highelf are out the equation, so what else is
obtainable?
