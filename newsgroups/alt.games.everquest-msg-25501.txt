I wouldn't be too tough on your group on this one.  If you have 3
additional mob adds, don't expect a low level pickup group to work
like a well oiled machine.  #1 You have to communicate to your group.
Set up a hot key to tell your group when you're under attack.  Don't
count on everyone just watching the health bars, especially tanks,
when multiple mobs are engaged. #2  Don't run around.  Stand still and
try to root it.  If root lands, have another hot key telling the group
the mob was rooted so they can go back to the original target.  If
it's really hairy, shadow step a few times to buy you space to get a
root off.  The worst thing you can do is flap around - there's nothing
more frustrating for a tank than trying to chase down and taunt a mob
off a fleeing caster.  NTM by flapping around zones with aggressive
mobs, you run the risk of pulling additional mobs (e.g. lions,
grizzilies, the griffon, etc.).  Keep at it, it gets better with
experience.
