There are a lot of great dungeons for a 30 level group.  Those listed above
are all good suggestions. Also Droga (the one off Frontier Mountains where
you get Mt. Death Mineral Salts), Nurga and Kaesora (check levels on last
two I can't remember what level I went there), House of Unrest (basement),
and even Permafrost and RunnyEye further in.

For pickup groups try Dawnshroud, South Karana and you can still get a few
levels out of Highkeep.

Also, outside of Cazic Thule, Golra Island in Tim Deep, Snow Cougars in Ice
Clad, a couple of camps in Echos Caverns and Stonebrunt (great zone-no one
goes there) would give good exp at around 30th level.
