So my credit card was refused because of the whole "Non re-upping" snafu.
Any way  I thought it a good time to give my credit card a rest.My Wal-mart
has a game card.....no!K-mart then has one .........no.Ok  so I check the
Everquest site and they have a card but to buy one you need a credit
card.?!??
My question is if you have a credit card why do you need a "game card".
