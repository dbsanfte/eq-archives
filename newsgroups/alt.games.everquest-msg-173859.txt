This is precisely the behavior I have observed.  I /bug'd it, but I
wouldn't be surprised if the dev reading the bug report didn't just
toss it figuring i was wrong about what happened.  Bet it takes a
lot of people bitching about the same stupid behavior over a few
weeks before they actually take a look at it.
