    Specifically using the bard bracer that casts a damage shield, yes.
That's exactly how it's done.

    See, the Concert Hall "request for silence" worked! :-)

    As for the soloing Sontalak thing, which I do not know the exact
step-by-step for, it involves getting CoV mobs to assist your charmed CoV
mob against big non-CoV mobs you pull, and doing at least one point of
damage to Sontalak with one of your DoTs. The assist thing is some buggy
faction nonsense, and the reason Sont's corpse doesn't poof when killed is
because of the fix done to prevent raid-mob corpses from poofing when DoT
damage becomes unattributed. In effect, your DoT ensures a corpse will be
left. From what I can tell from the threads that weren't deleted, it started
as a technique for soloing Tantor and evolved into a way for a bard to clear
WW solo. And yes, people have been suspended and banned for doing it.
