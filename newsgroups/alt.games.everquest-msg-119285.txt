Necro/druid is a great combination at all levels.
Ive only tried the ranger/enchanter duo at 50+. Enchanter uses level 49
animation, with an extra weapon for dual wield. Ranger snares, chanter
fears, pet kills (with a bit of help from the ranger). The level 49
animation is deadly! It slices and dices.
Not sure if ranger/enchanter is viable through the lower levels though...
might need a healer.
