I have a lvl 10 Warrior and wanted to dive into some spell casting,
but when i got my character i was lost and didn't know where to begin.
 One guy was nice enough to help me find my guild person and what not,
but i gave her my letter for the "frozen spell" and nothing happened. 
She was just "happy to except it" (that made me chuckle).

Could someone break down what I should be doing to get my first spell
up an running?  Do I just have to go out and Kill rats and snakes? 
I'm starting in W Freeport.

Thanks,
Chris
