Everything is all funky on my old PC due to it having 2 hard drives. Now I
just want to be able to format it and reinstall from scratch but my format
utilities cant handle NTFS(which they were converted to by XP) I cant seem
to be able to get to a C:\ prompt using the XP disc.

Please help I use that PC to look up stuff online while I play like maps and
quest info.
