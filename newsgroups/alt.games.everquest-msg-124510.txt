That's not the right way to look at it, as I won't be killing the same mobs
to finish off those last levels.  What would be much more useful is
something that shows your "typical" xp earning potential vs xp needed at the
various levels, rather than just telling me that I need to accumulate as
much xp as I have since level 1.  I will be getting a lot more xp per kill
now than I did at level 1 or 2 or 40.
