It's not about comparison.  Your's might require a stupid amount of crap, 
that doesn't mean the Rogue epic is "easy."  I think it's pretty obvious 
that really, in the end, you are just jealous of other classes who don't 
have to go through as much BS as you.

You are fooling yourself unbelievably here.

OMG... yeah, you did that "2 day sky run" all by yourself didn't you?  
SO much hard work for YOU.  We get the Golem piece every time we do them, 
sometimes twice in one clearing.  It's not like you need the fucking slime 
blood.

Yeah, Queen is a difficult fight.  Yeah, you have to race to Sev.

If you need a 2 day sky run to get Spiroc Blades, then work faster.  If 
you think the ball is a rare drop... well, I really have no response to 
that.  It isn't.
