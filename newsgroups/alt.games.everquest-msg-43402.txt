Just wondering how you can say this. When XP comes out will my 98se machines
stop working? How about the bajillions of people who have one of the older
OSes and dont feel like upgrading (like me)? I think 98 will be the gaming
OS of choice for quite a while. MS is having a bit of trouble, in that 98
works good enough for most people, and they dont see the need to upgrade.
I'm sure there are tons of people who dont know better than upgrade their OS
just because theres an upgrade available, but I'm betting the majority dont.
