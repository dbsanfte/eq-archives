 Yep. This is what I do and hardly ever have a problem. Lev and SOW are a 
must. You might get jumped by a spider stuck in the tunnel but if you do 
just keep on trucking. Stay high with the Lev by skimming across the tops
of the snow covered peaks before you get to the grass and dirt around Karnor
Castle trying to avoid the various beasties. Go straight west, and run along 
the side wall of KC. Might find a Drachnid at the FV zone tunnel entrance
too, but again just keep on running, the zone-in to FV is close to the mouth
of the tunnel. From the DL/FV zone take a left and hug the wall all the way 
to the stream and then up to the LOIO zone.
 
 This method is much faster and safer than taking the boat to FV and running
the gauntlet of Drachnids strung out between the Elven Outpost of Firiona
Vie and Lake of Ill Omen zone in my opinion. There is the small chance of
trouble on the trip from Hidden Valley to the FV zone and when it happens
it's going to be bad but frankly I've only had problems when I let either 
SOW or Lev drop before I got to the FV zone by farting around too long. You
should have enough time with SOW and Lev if you get it cast on you right 
before you gate to DL and don't fool around on the way to FV.
 
 Done it hundreds of times, a few close calls but always my fault or bad
weather. If it's snowing it will be a bit tough to navigate but if you 
are semi-profficient with sense heading and /loc coords you should be ok.
If you're not good at sense heading and/or the /loc command and coords
wait til the weather clears in Hidden Valley and get your SOW and Lev
refreshed. Hidden Valley is 99% safe to rest/med/hide/wait in. I've only
seen maybe one Yeti wandering in probably dragged in there by someone
looking for help or a zone-out (which doesn't exist).
