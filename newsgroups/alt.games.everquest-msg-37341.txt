And this will happen when exactly?

That makes them useful in specific cases only.  And only against
non-stunnable mobs like ToV mobs.  Yes, once the anti-gate spells are
in (and assuming they aren't totally fubarred from the get go),
wizards may be useful.

As it is, we seem to have no problems keeping gaters from gating by
having folks mana seive them.

Wizards are downtime generators.
Only time they are useful is when they are level 60 and have Dragon's
Bane (I've pretty much concluded that Giant's Bane is useless).

BTW, last I checked military artillary didn't require 10 mins of
sitting on their asses for mana to return after they popped off a few.
