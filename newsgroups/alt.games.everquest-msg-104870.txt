Augh, I hate that mob.  Con's blue to my level 40, but I've seen him wipe
out a group of 50+.  Truely frightening.  Well, I actually didn't -see- it,
as I was wearing my towel (Lore, Head Worn, AC 10000, HP 1000, Wis 250, Int
250, Cha 250, Bane Defence vs. Everything.), but I did watch the slaughter
scroll by.  I think I may have even bumped up against him while I was blind.

Next time I'll have to see if casting Flash of Light on myself works as
well.
