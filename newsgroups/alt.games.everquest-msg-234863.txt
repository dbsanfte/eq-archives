As Murphy's Law would dictate, I wound up on a day off from work on the 
same day GoD was coming out and the servers will be down all day. *sigh*.

The weather is crap, and I finally decided that I would light off Lords 
of Everquest just to check it out. I started the tutorial, and much to 
my surprise and annoyance, the screen continually scrolls off to the 
north until it hits the map at the edge of the world, in the darkness, 
and stops.  I read the booklet that came with it and went through all 
the options screens. I found a way to *slow* the scrolling down some, 
and if you hold the shift key you can slow it further, but no way to 
just stop it so you can see what the hell is going on with your troops 
that you're trying to learn about. You *can* stop the screen briefly by 
holding the left mouse button down and dragging it to create a temporary 
"box" on the screen for grouping units, but you can't do anything else 
while holding the mouse button and as soon as you let go it starts 
scrolling again.

If any of you have played with this, is there  way to stop the frigging 
scrolling so you can actually learn how to play the game?

Obviously not an emergency here, since once the servers come up I'll 
likely never turn the damned game on again anyway, but it's just annoying.
