Any of the resurrection spells have other features than giving XP
back after death:  eliminating travel time and the danger of
traveling to the camp.   Allowing the cleric to Revive (300 mana)
right away and provide an XP rez later (at least another 200 more,
maybe even 400 more mana) gives the group an "edge" they don't
have now.

The 400 mana difference between a Revive and Resurrection
is a Complete Heal the cleric will be able to cast immediately
or (probably) both a Resolution and Symbol of Naltron.  That's
enough to make the difference between being able to rez on
the spot or being forced to fall back to a safe spot to rez in a
lot of situations, especially considering the cleric is probably
LOM anyway if someone died.
