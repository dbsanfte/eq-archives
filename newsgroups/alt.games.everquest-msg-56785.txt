    Print this out also, then.  I have 10 binders.  2
big ones for maps (old and new world), 1 for spell 
information (have all the spells for every class printed
out, not just the ones I play), 1 for hand written notes
as well as things I've printed out from the newsgroup,
and six 1/2 numbers for various trades skills (ex 
"vol. II" is baking, brewing, and foraging).  The
skills used to reside in one big folder, but it was 
hard to modify it when new recipes came out.
   Overkill?  Yes, probably.  But I do use the note
books quite frequently when I play, and don't regret
having made them.
