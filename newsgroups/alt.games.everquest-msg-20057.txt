Take the shuttles from the butcherblock docks to the Ship in Tum deep and
that will take you to Firona Vie.  Once in FV, there is a barbarian hut on
the docks that you can buy and sell from at fair prices.

As far as safely navigating to LoIO, there are some drachnids and a
particularly nasty necro NPC that you'll want to avoid outside of the FV
compound.  I usually take the tunnel instead of the bridge out of the city.
The tunnel is in a hut to the right as you are facing out of the bank.  Once
you go through the tunnel, get high on the zone wall and it will take you to
the river that goes to LoIO.
Good luck and have fun in LoIO.
