Hi, I know there is a lot of talk about which stats to pump up on a monk in
the beginning - I put half into agi, and the other half in dex. (I find I
hit for no less than when I dump them all into strength). What I want to
know is how important is Sta? Am I at any serious disadvantage later on from
not touching that one, and if so are Sta increasing items readily available?
Thx in adavance.
