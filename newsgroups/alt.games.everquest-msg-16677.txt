    The hate list is an odd thing. Try duelling in the Butcherblock newbie
area, far away from the merchants. The people duelling will be attacked by
all the nearby Moss Snakes. Moss Snakes won't even attack a level 1 that
sits on them, but duelling riles them up. Also note the number of anecdotes
(and I have a few too, thanks to the Kobold Noble) of charmed PCs being sent
to attack PCs that are well away from the charming NPC, totally out of aggro
range and not on the hate list.

    That used to happen, too. ;-) Retlon Brenclog and the Elven Slave in
Crushbone were the worst examples of this - an NPC would get "confused" as
to what faction it was on, and start buffing the nearby Orcs. Then, next
time someone would fight an Orc near it - bam, add confused NPC. I heard
they fixed that, though (apparently one of the Sisters on Sisters Isle in
OoT was going to pirate faction and wasting people).
