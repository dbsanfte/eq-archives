Nice analysis. Illustrates that there are a lot of places where bugs could 
emerge, and I believe they are emerging. I had the benefit of being able to 
track both an individual death and a TPW last night in Stormhold and I 
verified that after the TPW I had about twice the debt that I had 
experienced when I died alone earlier. I was the highest level at 20 and the 
others in the party ranged from 17-19. According to the FAQ and your 
analysis, my result should not have occurred. I'll file a /bug report 
tonight.
