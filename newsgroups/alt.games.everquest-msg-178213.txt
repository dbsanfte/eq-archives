lammy is pretty crappy for offhand IMO.  you're going to want something that
hits harder than that.  take a look at a Centi LS (nice upgrade from centi
ss) or a Long Sword of Ethereal Energy (what my ranger is currently wielding
with some satisfaction).  neither will break the bank _too_ badly, but the
LSoEE might require some saving up ;)

Other than that: ditch the wurmy first chance you get.  Lammy makes a nice
primary hand weapon, especially into the 40s and early 50s when a lot better
stuff becomes available (like the Toxiferious Axe (sp?)).  With PoP, rangers
have a lot of nice 2hs options (despite what martin might say!), so i'd
suggest keeping that trained up.  Might want to invest in a Swarmcaller, has
a 50% slow proc, and works very well for my ranger when tanking or even just
when the slows will help the group out a bit ;)

HTH,

Meerina
