I can remember my very first visit to East Commons (the market zone on
my server.)  Back then the /auction channel was just that, people
would bid in it (sometimes via /tell) and the seller would update the
entire zone as to what the high bid/bidder currently was.

Spam-tastic but also a bit more sociable and interactive than the
bazaar AFK trader model we have today.
