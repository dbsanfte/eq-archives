It doesn't take long to say no to beggars, buff or otherwise. Although
giving a really snarky response to a friend's unknown alt asking for
buffs did get me into trouble once <g>.

Bah, who do I drop the stuff nobody want on now that your alt's are
equipped?  :p 

It's the downside of always being the Master Looter, what do you do
with all the stuff nobody wants and isn't worth selling to vendors.
Giving it to random beggars only encourages 'em, finding someone who
isn't twinked on Bristlebane is pretty much impossible, and just
destroying stuff is too wasteful.
