I'd love to see them actually fix issues that are reported to them on the 
test server prior to unleashing patches on us.  That would be a good 
start.  Yes, I want new content too, and I am willing to put up with the 
odd issue for that, but, when a bug is already known to them, and yet 
they still insist on patching, that is where I have a problem.
