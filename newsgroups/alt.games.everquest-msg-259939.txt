Aren't you jumping to conclusions here?  They are stress testing the
servers.  Presumably they are WAY more crowded than they will be in the real
game.  In the real game, it will probably be much less likely to get the
kind of crowds fighting for mobs that you are seeing now.  From what people
in the normal beta have reported, the game has a LOT of quests, so people
should be working on different things.

In the more normal case, where you don't have a huge crowd going after the
mob, it seems like their solution would work.  KSing usually happens when
party A starts fighting the mob, and party B comes along and outpowers them.

So let's take two cases.  First, let's consider the massively overcrowed
case you are describing.  It sounds like in WoW, there are problems there,
in that a bunch of independent groups can engage the mob, and no one knows
who will get it.  Same goes in the older games, like EQ...in that situation
you would not know which group is going to do more damage, so you wouldn't
know who is going to get it.  Now lets consider the second case: one group
going for the mob, and another comes along.  Under the WoW rules, it seems the
first group doesn't get KS'ed.  Under the EQ rules, they can be KS'ed.

So, it looks like the WoW rules *are* an improvement over the EQ rules, in
that they work better in the common case, and in the limit case, they fail
in basically the same way.

DAoC handles this nicely.  If a quest calls for killing mob X for item Y,
then item Y is not handled by the normal loot mechanism.  Rather, everyone
in the killing group who is on that quest and at the step where they need Y
gets Y, directly into the inventory.

DAoC is puzzling.  It has almost as many subscribers as SWG (and doesn't
have the licensing fees to Lucas, so probably makes a lot more money than
SWG).  It's quest system is nice and doesn't encourage KSing.  The way camp
and XP bonuses work discourage camping, but in a nice way.  It has a
successful PvP system.  Many of these are things that other games have
failed to do well--yet no one seems to try to copy DAoC.  Instead, they try
to copy EQ and fix its flaws--and usually fail.
