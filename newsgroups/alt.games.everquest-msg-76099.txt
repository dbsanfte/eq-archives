Had a lvl 4 Gnome friend do just this in reverse the other night...  The
only added peril was that he had to run through lesser Fay to get to the
GFay Scion.  He made it through there and was pretty home free.  He hunted
in Qeynos with a friend and I and was bound in SQ so he has a new home
apparently...  LOL
