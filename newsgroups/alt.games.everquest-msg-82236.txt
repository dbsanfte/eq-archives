>>> I swear i recall reading they put a recommended level BUT that it would
still work for lower levels. <<<

Alright everyone, try to pay attention this time:

taken from the latest patch message

>Added "Recommended Level" equal to the current item use level for the
several items.  All of these items require the player to be level 51+ to
equip them and/or use their effects.  Setting the "Recommended Level" field
like this just lets the player know what level they need to be to use the
item.  THE ACTUAL UTILITY OF THE ITEM WAS NOT AFFECTED IN ANY WAY, THIS
CHANGE IS PURELY INFORMATIONAL<

Shall I repeat, or can I turn off the neon lights?
