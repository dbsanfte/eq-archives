You see, there are upgrades and there are upgrades. Upgrading NT could
have consisted of making it faster casting, for instance, or healing a
tiny bit more. Not necessarily giving druids a gimp version of the
cleric speciality, which is only an upgrade if you think putting
leather clad people into a cleric CH rotation (so they don't have time
to debuff, cast quick assist heals, nuke, whatnot) where they won't do
the job of the cleric anyway is an upgrade.
