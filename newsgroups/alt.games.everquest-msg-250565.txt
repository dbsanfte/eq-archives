Average account has a 50+ character.  In these days of easy leveling, even
for the most casual player, getting to 50+ in a year is, well, easy.

Average account probably also has two or three twinks in the 30-50 range. 
If I can get a character from 1 to 30 in a week only on days that I'm not
raiding, anyone can do it in a month or two.

I do think there's a whole segment that gets to 50+ and starts over, thus
adding to the "amount of time played" in the 30-50 range.
