There is a situation similar to this that convinced me to never do a MQ
without someone I don't know.  Imagine that Joe /auc MQ Skyshrine Plate
Bracer, 5K.  So I contact Joe and agree to give 1/2 before 1/2 after.  So I
give Joe 2500, he then tells me he gave the armor to the quest giver, so I
give the 3 crushed flame emeralds.  He then hands in the armor.  Not only
has he gotten 2500pp, but he got the rest of his Bracer quest done too.

Granted this could only happen if we are the same class, but you see my
point.
