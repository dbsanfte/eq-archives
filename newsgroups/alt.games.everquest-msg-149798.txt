You are soooo right, but I must add that rogues are in the same boat.  After
30th level rogues get no additional skill until 50 when they can start
earning AA points.  I've been seeing all the "class balancing" changes and
wondering when someone would speak up for the rogues and warriors. Both
classes are really screwed up and it doesn't look like anyone cares.
