Maybe not optimal but doable. Me and my wife both 2box in LDON (which
can be a bit stressful) playing: 62SK, 62ENC, 61 SHM, 62 CLR. We had
alot of fails early on until we altered our play style and now can
beat them pretty consistantly, mostly slaughter missions - 55 mobs or
under (not sure we could do 59 mobs in 90 mins - but im determined to
do it) - and thats even with my 62 ENC locking up on me at least once
a mission (crappy video card in secondary system). Its all about
getting the most out of your class and working well together. We have
the advantage of sitting next to each other - so communication is
faster than typing.
