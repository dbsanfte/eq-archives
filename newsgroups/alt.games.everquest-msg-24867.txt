Lockpick skill seems to be unlike most.  If your skill isn't high enough,
you WILL NOT EVER succeed...and if it is high enough, you will succeed every
time.

Plus, to gain skill you must succeed in your attempt.  So if you're a level
6 rogue (the level they get the skill) unless it requires a minimum skill of
6 it'll never open for you.

And although it's possible that a full-sized ogre can squeeze through that
crack I've never seen it done (and ant potions are too expensive to use for
just 30 seconds).
