Bizbee, 

You seem like an honest guy, and my associates assure me that I can rely 
on your discretion and integrity. I represent the offices of the former 
prime minister of Nigeria who is currently in exile. We need to move a 
large sum of money out of Nigeria ...

;)

Sure the victims ought to have known better, but they are still the 
victims. Responsibily and FAULT still lie with the scammers not the 
victims.
