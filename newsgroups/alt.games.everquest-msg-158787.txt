I dumped my SotM (16/27 proc:Stun+50DD) for a Massive Dragonclaw Shard
(28/30 noproc) so my 1H damage wouldn't be so anemic.  But then I'm a
Paladin, I'd rather a Warrior held agro most of the time and I can
generally take it when I want it.  Oh, and Rangers seem to dump agro
just fine, when I've grouped with Rangers I've enjoyed the fact that I
didn't have to worry as much about agro management, I'm surprised to
hear you say that you've had agro trouble with Rangers.
