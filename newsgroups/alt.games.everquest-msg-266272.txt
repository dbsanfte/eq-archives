I think the gaming companies are too worried about losing court case and
don't want to risk opening that pandora's box.

They are all probabaly hoping "the other" gaming company starts selling in
game gear for dirt cheap so they all can follow suit.

Personally I don't think price is much of an issue. Gamers that will pay
real money to get whatever in the game will do so.
Better to undercut all competition. Create your own database of what sells
what doesn't and try to control items in game thru no drop. Character
transfers should be easy to handle if they really wanted to control that.
