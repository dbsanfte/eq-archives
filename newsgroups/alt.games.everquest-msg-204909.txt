Your weapon skills are capped at 200 from L39 until L51.  If that's
a Chitin Shell Shield (ac15 ??svP and _not_ magic) you should do
yourself a huge favor and replace it with a decent magic shield.
As an example, the Clay Guardian Shield (ac25 50hp) was selling for
under 200pp the last time I played on a regular server.  And the
Sarnak Battle Shield (ac25 5str 5sta 40hp 10svM 10svF 10svC) was
well under 1000pp.  At L40 you should have a serviceable 1h weapon
and a magic shield on you (not in bank) at all times simply because
Bash (which should be at your pre-51 max skill of 175 by now) is an
important part of your ability to neutralize enemy spellcasters.
I'm not saying these should always be equipped, I'd be surprised if
you had a 1h weapon that could match your 2hander for damage output.
But, unless you have some reason to be certain that you will not be
fighting spellcasters until after your next trip to the bank (like
a trip to Rathe Mountains to fight HGs, you'll almost certainly want
to bank your gains from that before going elsewhere), you should
have them in your inventory.  The Paladin is better than any other
class at neutralizing enemy casters, you should always be prepared
to exercise your class strengths and Bash contributes importantly to
one of them.
