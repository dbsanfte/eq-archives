I've seen these too, and have been curious, but doubt they contain anythis
useful. More than likely they contain strageties you already know or are
bunk:

"Make thousands of plat in an hour" - probably 2 pages in 72pt Font saying
"Go to Rathe Moutains"...

"Make 10 levels per hour!" - probably levels 1-10, and all you need is 200
DF belts to do it !!

"Get all uber gear!" - buy his char off e-bay!!

Sheesh.
