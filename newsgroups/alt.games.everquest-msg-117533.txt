I see a lot of people saying "yes, your gonna sit on your ass and mostly
med/heal 24/7" but I disagree.

As an example, Kael arena: a pretty tough area/tough mobs (I still see
multi-group raids wipe there often)

With me running my monk (60) and botting the shaman (60), a guild friend 60
monk I play with often, and a guildie 60 cleric (no warrior, *no chanter*,
*no c2 or kei*) - the cleric melees about 80% of the time.

The only time he really needs to 'properly med' is after he casts (and
re-casts) group aego.. the rest of the time you can find him meleeing with
his blackstar (granted it procs a group heal, but to be honest 105 or so
hitpoints every now and then makes little to no difference to group
efficiency)

Im not totally kitted out in phat l00tz, I can easily keep agro fast and
permanently tho (which helps mana a lot, by only needing to cheal 1 target);
but even so its not like we have "mad overkill" for the arena.

In a place like Seb (which for the most part is trivial nowadays) I wouldn't
have a problem if that cleric pulled or tried his hand at tanking (assuming
he could get/hold agro anyway)
