I'm not sure what you'd consider a "hack".  But here are some things
I've played with that were fun and informative.  Nothing to steal
account information or get infinite platinum or violate your license
if that's what you're looking for.

The tutorial hack:  It's possible to slightly modify the little EQ
tutorial program to make it load any zone you want.  Not all zones
work, you don't see any NPC's, and most regular EQ commands aren't
implemented, but it's a great way to explore a zone you're curious
about.   http://www.hackersquest.gomp.ch/html/faq.shtml#2

EQInside:  This program understands the format of the S3D files.  
You can use it to browse through the files and examine the textures,
for example.  Not very useful, but fun.  You can also extract the
WLD files, which contain the geometry information for the zone,
and put them into...

ZoneConvertor:  This program reads a .WLD file, which contains
the geometry information for a zone, and converts it into a
standard 3D file format.  You can then load the 3D file into a
3D viewer and look at the whole zone.  Or you can write your own
program like I did to load the zone file and wander around it.
You don't get any of the texture information, just the geometry,
so everything is a single color.

You can find EQInside and ZoneConvertor here:

There are other things on the site that look interesting but
I haven't played with them.
