Yeah it's a shame.  Never played one myself and maybe a tiny part of that is 
because of the stigma that was attached to them in EQL.  I would be curious 
to hear from any Iksar monks as to whether they experienced any "hate" at 
launch.  On my EQL server they were immediately relegated to "kewl dood" 
status.  That may have passed though.
