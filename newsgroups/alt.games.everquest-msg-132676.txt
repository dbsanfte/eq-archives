My wife and I have both noticed a bug, I assume due to recent patches,
where our friends list suddenly got glued onto our ignore list.  This
has happened to each of us.  I assumed it was a one-time event, but
recently another friend of mine appeared on my ignore list.  Just
wondering if others have run into this and if there's a fix.  I've
already had a couple of instances where people got very annoyed that I
was't answering their tells.
