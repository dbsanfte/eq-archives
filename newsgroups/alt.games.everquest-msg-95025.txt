Never said that... and this is the WHOLE POINT of  *my* rant.

You can't say that someone said something if you can't present evidence to
prove it.

There's a lot of lawyers out there making shitloads in legal fees defending
and prosecuting cases where two people (who actually have money and
reputation at stake) over this kind of thing.

If it were just my word against Davids', then it's just be the two of us
disagreeing with our own recollections. Which is a normal, everyday thing
betweem 2 people.

What YOU are implying, bizbee, is that I've stated that David has told a lie
in a publicly available, published medium.
If I had done such a thing, David could sue me.
As it stands, I could sue YOU for your statement.
This sort of thing gets really dangerous when it involves people with money
to spare for litigation and think such statements could affect their
reputations.

What I've done is to present the SOURCES of this rumour as close as I can
still get and pointed out the relevant information. Re-read the whole thread
and follow the links.
