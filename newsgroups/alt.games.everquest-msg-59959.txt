he is normal gnome faction, so he hates dark elves of inny the most
but generally anyone of inny. He also attacked my 37 cleric and was
blue to her. She killed him one time but then another she went oom and
ran.

Eventually he becomes a huge wuss and he can't hit you well even
though he is blue con.

An odd thing about him though is he has GM style regen, you can see
him regenning at a FAST rate right as you are nuking him. Its not that
he has a lot of HP, but he regens FAST AS HELL. Its pretty obvious you
are not meant to kill him though he dies and gives XP.

He was not always there either, instead the jewelry vendor who is
upstairs now was in his place.

Not sure what faction he is on, gnome are generally hard to raise from
killing. Gix raises "eldrich collective" which is gnome caster guild
but the guy in freep is not a caster.
