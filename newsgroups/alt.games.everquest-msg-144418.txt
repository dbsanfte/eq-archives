You can start doing pieces of your pet focus item quests now.

You are high enough level to take out mermaids in Ocean of Tears,
and get XP from them.  They drop scales, keep one.  You are also
high enough level to take out drakes in Lavastorm (again getting
xp from them) keep one of the scales they drop.  While you are
in OOT, ask if anyone is camping Gornit - if they are, ask (nicely)
if it would be ok for you to loot the toes he drops.  The aren't
worth much compared to the cash drops, and most players let them rot.
(He'll drop Fire Giant, Ice Giant and Hill Giant toes - you'll need
one of each).

Goto http://www.magecompendium.com and check out the section on
these quests.
