I play on Kane Bayle, possibly the least populated non-UbiSoft server.
 I like how it is right now, since I play a Beastlord and I like to
solo.  But when EQ2/WoW come out...I'm afraid the population will get
so low that they're either going to have to merge us with another
server (most likely Antonius Bayle) or just give us all free transfers
to some random server.  Naturally there will be a big drop in
population when EQ2 comes out, but from what I've read, I predict that
after the free month is up most of them will come back.  WoW promises
to take a bigger cut of the population, but SOE will want to wait to
see if people return before merging servers.  However, an extremely
lightly populated server is a waste of resources, so my prediction is
about 3 months after WoW is released.  Assuming they release before
Christmas, my guess is in March of 2005...let's just make my official
guess March 15, 2005.

Game on,
