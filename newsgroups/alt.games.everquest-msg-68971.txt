Sounds like one of the fan bearing has gone bad, and as it heats up, it
begins to vibrate. I have had this happen on a couple of comps here at work.
Sounds fine when it first boots up, but eventually gets rather loud. Open
the computer up when the system is on, and making noise. If you feel
comfortable, try stopping the fan on the processor, and the cooling fan. You
should then be able to tell where it is coming from.
