I suspect you are off by at least an order of magnitude.  Its going to
take at least 2 weeks to get the druids, mages, and Necros up to level
50, and at least 2 months to get the rest of the team geared and
leveled  for vox/Nagafen.  After that, it will be at least another 2
months before the Kunark bosses fall.  Velious will be a little
quicker, but not by much.  Then it will take 2-3 months of farming
before there are enough keyed players to make an emp run to finish VT
flagging and then 2-3 weeks to drop VT.  TIme flagging will take 2
months at a minimum due to flagging time constraints. lockout timers
etc.  TIme will fall very quickly, but then back to another 2 months of
farming time to gear up for GoD.  3 months in GoD doing flagging and
clearing.  Omens will be much quicker, but still flag farming will take
a bit of time.


Don't underestimate the Effect Trickle down has on gearing up, even at
the highest levels. And remember that all of the people who developed
and perfected those well known strategies always left out key points,
and even when they did not, and AL strat may not work for BotS or BoW
or TMO.

Most strategies in use today, assume focus effects(that may not be
available), Haste that isn't common in old world, and other gearing
effects that Just won't be available.  To my knowledge, the fastest
0-50 on a fresh server was just over 15 days, and that was with Kunark
available.  I predict lots of dirty tricks, like ogre's 4 deep in the
Unrest tunnel.  Hadden will die within 10 seconds of popping, GBS, and
BD jewelry will be required gear.  I expect to see hate and fear
farming for a week or 4 before the dragons are attempted, because when
old world armor is the best you have, fear gear starts to look good,
and hate gear is teh ubar.  The other option is to use bind rushing on
nagafen and vox with 200 bodies and just hope to drop them.
