[Mon Nov 27 23:05:33 2000] You say, 'hail Lady Shae'
[Mon Nov 27 23:05:33 2000] Lady Shae says 'Hello.  It is always good 
   to meet someone new.  I am Lady Shae of the House of Dumas.  And 
   what [house] are you from?
[Mon Nov 27 23:05:41 2000] You say, 'I am from the house of pancakes'
[Mon Nov 27 23:05:41 2000] Lady Shae says 'I can tell.  You look like 
   you ATE a house of pancakes.

FYI, here is the "correct" response:

[Fri Jun 29 18:41:28 2001] You say, 'I am from no house'
[Fri Jun 29 18:41:28 2001] Lady Shae says 'Good.  I care not to 
   hang around any snobs this evening.  Would you be so kind as 
   to buy me some wine?
[Fri Jun 29 18:41:48 2001] You say, 'Lush'
