I don't know of any way to sort the group list.   Personally, I just
rearranged the windows so I don't have any problems targeting
someone.   The right side of my view is arranged like this:

[self]
[target]
[group]
[hot keys]

The spell gems are just off to the left.

I'd suspect you need a /pause there to avoid interrupts (or it may
just ignore the /sit).   I don't suggest using /pause in any heal
macro, simply because it locks you into the macro.   Just imagine
a Complete Healing fizzle and not being able to do *anything* for
10 seconds...

/sit off
/gsay SHeal inbound on %t in 4 seconds
/cast 1

> FYI: "/doability 1" is Sense Heading so I'm always keeping it at its max.

Map it to a movement turn key, like right-arrow.   Then it just
maxes as you move around.   Faster to max, and it takes the
message out of the battle spam, unless you're moving and have
it mapped on that hotkey bank.

Calling the type of heals and the cast duration helps keep people
informed, and that's a good thing.

Main Heal
Secondary Heal
Stun (chain-stun macro)
OOM ("/gsay CLERIC OUT OF MANA!!!!!")
GTG ("/gsay Cleric good to go")
Sit/Stand
Assist ("/assist name")
Loc (I really like knowing where my corpse is and I'm not going
to switch hotkey pads after I figure out I have to run)

That's just the "grouped and being a cleric" hotkeys.  I have others
for soloing and traveling.   The GTG macro is simply because good
groups won't pull if you're not ready, and I get tired of telling them
I am.   They don't care about my mana level -- just whether I'm
GTG or not.   For some groups/locations, that's 80m, for others it's
40m.

Chain stunning is something you'll have to get used to doing simply
because you're starting to get into the range where you'll be fighting
caster mobs that can NOT be allowed to complete a cast.   A mob
that gates and then summons isn't much fun if it successfully gates....
Neither are mobs that use Complete Healing, for that matter.

/sit off
/cast 3
/cast 4
/cast 5

That's a Stun macro that you just mash and keep mashing until the
mob is dead.  It casts whichever of the three stuns are available in
order, bypassing the other two.   Use them in recycle time order
so the first will be close to being ready when the last one has been
used.

I also swap out Divine Barrier for Divine Aura.  You looked at the
casting time, right?   BIG difference because there's no reason to
use it unless you're getting hit, and then you want something that
goes off quickly.   The HP regen simply isn't worth dying for.

Swapping out buffs also gives you another gem slot (you use a slot
for something you cast at most once every two and a third hours
and that's useless.)    That lets you put either a DD spell or a crowd
control spell or one of the stamina line in that slot or even Atone,
for that matter.   Or the Res line for when FD didn't work. ;)

That makes my gem list:

swap out slot
stun #3
stun #2
stun #1
gate
DA
lesser heal
main heal

You shouldn't need a third heal, unless you want to swap in a lesser
one to touch-off a caster type.   I always cast heals off macros, so
I don't care that they're on the bottom of the list/screen.   (The
only exception is my traveling hotkey bank, where I'm not going to
cast a heal anyway.

For traveling, BTW:

live DD
undead DD
main stun
main root
Atone
DA
Gate
GHeal (that's enough to get away and it's quick)

DA is in the same slot, so it's always available.   Having the DD lines
available means I can either solo something annoying or stun it,
root it, move back and Atone it and go on knowing it's forgot about
me.   That list also means I can help anyone that needs it that I
run across, but always have the "sorry, no buffs mem'd" available
for beggars.  ;)
