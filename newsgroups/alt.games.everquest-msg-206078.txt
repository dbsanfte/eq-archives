There are so many zones at that level.  Just a few of the popular
ones:
The Great Divide
Easterns Wastes
Dawnshroud peaks
Grimling forest
Hollowshade moor to some degree
Tenebrous mountains
The Eastern Wastes IZ to Kael Drakkel
Estate of Unrest
Mistmoore Castle
Echo Caverns


Also, check this nice level / zone reference on Allakhazam as I'm sure
I'm missing a lot of good zones at that level:
