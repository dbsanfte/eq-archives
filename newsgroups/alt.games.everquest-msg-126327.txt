Well, 3 things I have to say about this.  Followed by my typical incoherent
ramblings.

1) It's not just a FT earring, it's got godly stats too, comparable/better
than nearly any other druid wearable earring (even for the all/all FT
earring), I particularly like the ac/sta/hp/mana/saves between it and my
OoIV; I'm up to 859 ac and 1743 hp self buffed now (hit 200 defense a few
days ago too), still around 200-205 wis though, but with around 500 +mana
too.

2) I have problems harassing enchanters for KEI, after all, I hate
an_gimp_noob_1337 asking me for sow+regen+sln+thorns+str as much as anyone,
why should an enchanter enjoy every caster in the game telling him "can u
give me kodiacs plz" while he's in a group or doing tradeskills or banking,
etc.

3) I do some insane solo shit that makes gating out to pay for KEI
*EXTREMELY* fucking inconvenient when it gets dispelled every 10 minutes or
having to run through half a dungeon (and/or use a charge on my IvU potion)
to get back.

Not like my exp is moving much anyways in 54 =X

Though it did feel good to kill the Allizewsaur after he LD ganked me, I
might take up camping him as a serious hobby (level 50, 8-10khp appx., rare
planar gem loots a'la BD, diamond, black sapphire, jacinth).  Allizewsaur,
CoM, and ToFS 5(green loot farmage) and ToFS 6a(exp) are about the only
places I feel like hunting anymore solo other than breaking up spawn times
in CS every once in a while to screw with the quadders (they just love
seeing me with 3-5 wyverns rooted all over the plateau, and I like being
able to cherry-pick dark blues).

Btw, thank you to James for suggesting that I work on my hp gear back a
month or two ago when I asked what I should buy with my money, my hp binge
is almost complete, just need Elysian legs (50hp) and some sort of BP
upgrade (Elysian would be good, though I do want SS or even Thurg BP for the
RotG click).  I don't even know why I carry around my Coldain boots or
Nathsar arms anymore to be honest when I like the ac/hp (and look =P) on my
Elysian/Gladi chain (respectively) too much.  Soloing elysians is fairly
simple, but boring as hell, as well as being dependent upon my KEI and
jackass supply. (UP trains dumped on you = fucking nasty)
