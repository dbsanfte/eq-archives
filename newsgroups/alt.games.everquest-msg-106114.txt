Here is something even cooler. When I pull I use a hotkey with /assist as the
first line. For a melee it would be

/assist
/attack on

for a caster use

/assist
/cast spellnumber(use the number for your pulling spell)

Tjis way there is no way you can attack a mob that is agroed on someone. The
target would switch to the person it was agroed on and attack or casting would
fail.
