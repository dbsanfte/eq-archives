    Lots of going AFK somewhere in the target zone, feigned, to pick up
extra raid points!! Every raid leader I know takes attendance by doing a
/who, then pulling the names out of their log. What would be a lot better,
are you reading SOE please please please, would be an auto-dump function
similar to the one on the guild management tool, that could dump the
contents of the Raid window to a file with a time stamp. You could see who
was with who when you won and lost important fights, track unflaggeds over
time, do dead-accurate attendance records (boot anyone that has to leave for
the day), etc.

    Ok, the BP is nice. But it's not the be-all and the end-all, nor are the
legs. Not for an elemental guild. Rumblecrush BP is more than an acceptable
substitute (and I'm sure you saw a few of those during your VT days), and
the legs have worse HPs than your Velious gear. And both have effects on
them that you will get elsewhere in PoP (FT on damn near everything you see,
Marr's Gift on Sol Ro cloak/elemental plate arms). Really, the good pieces
in the Aten set are the Wrist (stats are actually competitive with the other
wrists available) and the Ring (unique ability) - both those go in slots
where you need two of an item so competition with others is fierce. Oh, and
the Mask has better general Mana Preservation than anything you'll see for a
long, long time.

> Most clerics still have lots of Skyshrine Armor.

    We had lots of clerics in Skyshrine/Kael still after VT, and it wasn't
because we favoured tanks at that time. It's because cleric Skyshrine is
pretty nice stuff, especially the legs.

    My gauntlets have more AC than my BP, too. Welcome to elemental armour.
AC matters in PoP, if you're high enough.

    That's very wise. We have one warrior that is part time (all others are
full time), so she hasn't had the drops diverted to her that the other
warriors have. Poor thing can't last through an entire fight. She just
can't. Every so often, the mob will do a near-full round of damage on her
and she poofs. Unless your tanks are above a certain level of HPs, they
simply cannot tank elemental bosses adequately.

    Unless you want the next MT rotation called out to have you at the
front, I'd let the warriors get theirs first. =) It really does mean the
difference between success and failure. The two guilds on my server that are
sort of struggling in the elemental planes are both on points and don't have
warriors as part of the "select few" near the top of the points rankings.
And they just can't last against mobs.

    What do you want in a BP? If you're looking for fair resists and some
HPs, get a group or two together after raids are done and go kill Vindi.
You'll get a BP. And it's not like the other, smaller guilds will resent you
killing something that repops every eight freaking hours.

    Our one cross-server cleric didn't have AA's anywhere near that. Heck,
I'm just in the 120's and don't have DivArb. It's meant to discourage Joe
Casual who just got Run III from applying.

    I seem to recall that buff extension is capped at 50% max total (item
plus AA), and there are Patience of Eternity items you can expect to have a
shot at eventually. No, can't remember where I heard that about a cap. So
I'd nix SCRM. Were I you I'd get MC I (stacks with FT), HA I, HG 1, then
finish off RC II and III. RC III is really, really useful. And the
two-pointers are nice, quick day projects with elemental XP.
