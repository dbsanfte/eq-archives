i disagree here.  i'm a necro and i get beat on all the time.  i think it's
because the necro has to cast his dots at the beginning of battle for them
to do the most amount of damage.  each dot has an initial damage, then does
more every few seconds, so it ends up that the necro is actually doing alot
of damage right off the bat, and therefore gets aggro.  i have a channelling
skill of 200 plus a 3% channeling mod because i need to do a root and run
technique or a feign death while i'm getting hit.
