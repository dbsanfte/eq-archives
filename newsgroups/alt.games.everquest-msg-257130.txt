The OP wanted to preorder from Sony, these are all the Ubisoft
version. Now, since they announced that you can buy either version
and play on any server, that might not sound like a problem, but if
he's a SOE customer already he may specifically want to buy SOE's
version so he can make use of, for example, the Access All Areas
pass.

It's buying the SOE version from abroad and getting charged import
tax on top of that that costs the extra money, although several opportunist
stateside shops have taken the chance to cash in and charge over the
odds for exporting the SOE version. The worst I saw wanted to charge
around $30 more to cover import tax on the game, and another $30
for import of the CC disk!

To answer the OP though, I don't know anywhere that is selling it
cheaper than the one you mentioned, maybe the folks at eqii.com
on the messageboards know.
