My only complaint with this is that they are leaving Paladins even
further out of healing ability. Paladins (who are suppossedly a
cleric/fighter mix) don't get Superior Heal until 57, when both Druids
and Shaman get this at 51. I'm not saying that Paladins should outheal
Druids/Shaman, but I'd think Superior Heal at 55 or so with one more
decent heal at 60 would be nice. At least the Paladins get better
rezzes now.

I like the druid/shammy change in the sense that it does allow groups
without a cleric a little more range in what they can fight. Obviously
if you can get a cleric thats best. But it not, its nice to think that
some targets would now be available that would not have been.
