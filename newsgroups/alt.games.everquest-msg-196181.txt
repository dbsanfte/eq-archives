I know it's less than this at your level, but I know that I get a
significant amount more doing this, even than canni-ing as fast as I can,
and it uses a lot less health. It's no (ahem) hassle to do when you're not
tanking if you a) set up a hotkey and b) get a nice interface with %'s on it
so you can watch for the ticks.

Ok, so who am I kidding. Jumping up and down biting my feet for mana is no
fun, but it is the fastest way to do things by far!
