Until you personally code a game half this size dont bitch about problems
other ppl have. It's thier job yes and they are doing the best they can. All
you are doing by crying like this is proving you are an immature child.

Grow up. Learn some patience. Ask mommie for warm milk to help you nap while
waiting for EQ to get back.

/rant off

Give the people some time. They are fixing the problems they can't as fast
as they can. It's thier job and they know they will lose customers if they
don't fix stuff ASAP.
