Every now and then, in the past, I've borrowed a friend's druid to
drag along with my beastlord for spot healing, thorns, ports and
snare.  The machine I use for the second account is capable of playing
EQ, but the video card is borderline...  but since I did everything
with hotkeys it wasn't a big deal.  Much.  Granted, I *hate* the old
models these days, but that's not the end of the world. 

Lately, I've had some access to a cleric to bot.  This opens up some
more options for my beastlord (I, um, hate to fearkite and quite
frankly, I'm tired of pet cleric right now).  I can do fun things like
duo with the cleric in PoN or PoD - the BL is a bit twinked and can
tank tier 1 just fine as long as there's a CH per fight from the
cleric.  Even tanked Plane of Torment zone in birds this afternoon.
(/rawr!)  So that's been good and I'm having fun.  
However, now I add a problem with ergonomics.  The second machine is
over to the left of my main machine (I'm right-handed) and after a
couple hour session I'm a bit 'twisted' up from leaning over/reaching
over to hit hotkeys.  And if I have to switch over to the cleric
quick-like to root and other rudimentary crowd-control it gets kinda
ugly quick!  I fear I'll never be left handed.

Tonight I decided to see how well I can truly run two instances of EQ
on my one main machine.  I've done it a lot in the past, but only for
item txfrs and stuff, never to actually melee/heal. 

The specs of my 'main' machine:

AMD 2500+ Barton core
1gig ram
80GB WD JB drive (the 8mb cache flavor)
a second 40GB drive (7200rpm ATA100)
a GF4200ti video card.
win2k pro

Once I got the second instance up and going everything was great.
Alt-tab was very responsive (instantaneous) and neither session
appeared to lag.  Quite frankly, I liked it a lot!  
BUT - and here's the kicker -that's once I got things going.  You see,
initially, it must've taken at least 5 minutes to get the second
account up!!  And during most of that, I lose the mouse so can pretty
much plan on just sitting and typing only until char 2 is done logging
on.  I'd like to think that's not normal. (please?)

So, I'm pondering ways on improving startup:

1) copy everything over to the second drive and run the 2 eqs from 2
different drives

2) look into EQW - would that make any difference in startup times?

Finally - is there any way to run both instances full screen instead
of windowed? I'm guessing not since it goes windowed as soon as I hit
alt-tab, but figure I'll ask.  :-)

Y'all have a Happy Holidays!
