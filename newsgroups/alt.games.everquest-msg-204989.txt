Maybe, but I've read that kind of attitude enough times on various message
boards to know that many guys believe it.  I've met a lot of female
characters in EQ and, assuming that at least 50% of them are actually being
piloted by women, I'd say that my experience has been the opposite of the
idea that women are too distracted doing other things to play well.  If
anything, they seem more intense and into it than the guys.
