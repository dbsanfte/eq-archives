I can't find the Questwars/Everwars comics anywhere.  It was a comic
strip with pictures from starwars and EQ captions above peoples heads.
 It was hilarious and I want to send the link to a friend.  But I
can't find the comic anywhere.  =(  Please someone tell me it's still
available somewhere.  Thanks.
