The whole article's really vague and possibly misleading.  Read this for a
second, from the article:

"At this week's Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles, publishers big
and small buzzed about how the proliferation of game consoles and PCs with
high-speed Internet connections opened up new opportunities for selling
extras such as additional levels and exotic digital weaponry."

A quick read of this paragraph might convince someone that SOE is looking
into selling items for its online games, but that's not what this says.  Why
do they mention PCs and game consoles with high-speed internet connections?
What relevance does that have?  If I buy something, let's say 100k platinum
or a couple of PoT items, what possible difference does it make if I'm on a
high speed connection or not?  I believe it's more in reference to the fact
that things they used to sell conventionally, that they'd *have* to sell
conventionally, they can now, and much more in the future, just transfer it
electronically and remove having to produce any hard copies for sale at all.
So that game designers now can offer smaller, less significant add-ons that
don't require the full blown project of an expansion to justify its wide
hard copy release, and just sell it for less than an expansion   Nothing to
do with EBay or IGE sales whatsoever.

And I also noted that this:

"Sony will start selling add-ons -- such as weapons for an adventure
character or a souped-up car for a racing game -- next year, said Andrew
House, executive vice president of Sony Computer Entertainment America.

Some of the add-ons will be items normally earned by long hours of play;
novice players could pay to equip themselves with the same gear as more
experienced competitors.

The inspiration for the Sony initiative, said House, came from participants
in online subscription games who sell virtual goodies they've earned in the
game on EBay Inc.'s auction site, sometimes for thousands of dollars.

"It showed that the customer was willing to pay for online, downloadable
content," House said."

Unlike the rest of the article, did not rely to the same extent on quotes
from a source.  Yes, these paragraphs sound pretty discouraging, especially
the comment about Sony's inspiration, but I have to wonder why the writer
didn't supply a direct quote there, and why, in the actual direct quote from
Andrew House, he mentions that customers are willing to pay for "online,
downloadable content".  But again, what's being downloaded from an IGE or
EBay transaction?  All that needs to be changed for me to get any item on
any of my characters is a minor change to one of SOE's servers, and, as far
as I know, no change whatsoever on my computer.

This is the only part of the article that mentions something like this, the
rest of it refers to things that quite clearly are not part of the whole
"sell ingame items in EQ for RL cash" mode.

The other people seem to be talking about enhancements or add-ons that you
could download that would make your game more interesting or entertaining,
using the example of the green uniforms for Notre Dame for EA's online NCAA
football game, or different upgrades or cars that currently aren't available
for racing games, or as another example, the monster models that came out
for NWN after the initial game release.  Traditionally, you could only get
these items from an expansion pack (or an add-on pack, since sports games
and racing games usually don't have expansions in the way they're referred
to in RPGs).  Instead, there's a real interest in making these things
available online, so the customer pays for the particaular things they want
online, downloads them, and doesn't have to buy a hard copy full of extras,
most of which they might not want, that will also run them probably $25-35,
rather than $2-5 for a smaller set of items that they really do want.  And
it saves the game maker a lot of money too.

It may be a lot of concern over nothing, since I'm not convinced from that
article that Sony was really looking to fill the role that IGE currently
fills.
