I've done that route you describe regularly with un SoWed lvl 7 characters
(my monk and my ranger both have done the run at that sort of level).
I dont know how a lower level character would hold up but I generally
stick to newbie areas till I get to 7.


Kithicor is fine even at night, you just get as high up the zone wall as
you can and run around the north edge. Im seen the odd undead mob to be
careful about, but once they move its fine.

Stick to the roads when you do this and generally its a fairly safe route
requiing you to stop occasionally but thats about all.
