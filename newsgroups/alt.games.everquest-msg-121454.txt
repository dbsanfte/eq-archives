Yeah, they are.  But you gotta keep in mind the stuff going for 3K are uber
items you won't see until you are in your 50s at least.  If you don't spend
any money, you can get 1000s of plat in your 30s if you go to the right
places.  My hubby is 41 and he's got 1500 in the bank, most of which came
from DL in the last week or so. Hang in there, you'll get more money as you
progress.
