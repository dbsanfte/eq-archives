Well, that must be at least part of the problem then... I NEVER group. And
I, like you, never charge for a buff. I get cash the old fashioned way... I
go out and beat on shit that gives it up. Which I suppose means that I'll
never be rich ingame either. I talked to a guy a few days ago who told me
(he might have lied, I dunno) that he had 80,000pp in the bank. That sound
like bshit? He was pretty high in lvl -- 60, I think.
