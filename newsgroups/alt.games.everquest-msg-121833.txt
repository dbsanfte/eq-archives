After I logged on after a server crash 2 days ago I thought I saw a small
change in my lv 24 ogre warrior. After rubbing my eyes it seems to be true
that he suddenly was a lv 57 half elf ranger. I logged on and was suddenly
in Felwithe as a 57 half elf ranger, after gotten over that shock I decided
to petition because I'm sure I would be in trouble if some gm found out
about the whole thing. A kind guide read my petition and told me that a real
gm need to look into this, and I petitioned again. Now after a few days
nothing have happened and I'm wondering if I can get away with it if I keep
him. Does anybody here know if my new char is a duplicate of another or have
I really swapt places with the ranger. Something I also noticed is that I
was not a member in my guild and my surname was not what I had made for my
ogre warrior.

So have anybody here been in a similar spot and can give me some advice, I
really like the thought about going to a raid and not have a clue what to do
;-) I don't really think I will play him if I get to keep him, but most of
the stuff would be transferd to my others chars.

And if I would delete him, would I really delete some poor unlucky person
character (he got an epic weapon)

Cheers

RS
