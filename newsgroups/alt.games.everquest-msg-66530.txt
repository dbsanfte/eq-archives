I have this exact problem, but without SoL. I alternate between two
characters, one in Warsliks Woods and one in Timorous Deep. Works fine for
awhile, but then the Tim Deep framerate becomes extremely slow, about 1
frame per second. Log into WW, no problem. Back into TD, problem there
again.

However, I can clear the problem by quitting back to the server selection
screen.
