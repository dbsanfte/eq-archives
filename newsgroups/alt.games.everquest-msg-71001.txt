Sorry, within the Allakhazam site I was referring to the mana calculation
within the "your characters" section; not the link out to castersrealm.

Of course, I completly overlooked the fact that within that section, the
calculation will include any +mana modifiers one items you have on; which is
why the number is different.   : slaps head and looks stupid

(however, I think they could present the mana calculation in a clearer
format within that screen, but not really important).


Thanks
