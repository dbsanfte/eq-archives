Without harmony a KOS person can't walk by him without agro (sneak
might work, never chanced it).  I pull 30+ corpses out from under his
chin, his legs, his belly and his tail. 

I can do this not because of a small agro radius, but because the
anti-corpse-dragging code does not exist in any of the outdoor zones.
To my knowledge, it exists in Kael, skyshrine, icewell keep, and maybe
Thurg (not sure).  

If you don't believe me, make a character on Mith Marr.  I'll port you
to wakening lands, drag your corpse to Wuoshi's toe, take a screenshot
of it, then drag it Kael for ya.
