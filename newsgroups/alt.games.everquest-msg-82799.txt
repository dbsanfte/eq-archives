Well, I know how much you Soc.Men guys like to talk about circumcision, and
nothing but circumcision, and just keep talking about that, even so, you got
the wrong man.  I added RAB and MWS, not SM which was already there, and
since it was there, it struck me that it wouldn't hurt to change the subject
to the consideration of something that really is worth talking about in your
group, which is nothing less than a totally hot dame like Jennifer Jason
Leigh.

So, if you got something better to talk about than her, I'd sure like to
know what the hell that is.  And for the sake of your edification, I
present, once again, just that part of the message . . .

See for example the film that was on the Sci-Fi Channel tonight
with Jennifer Jason Leigh, "eXistenZ".

I almost never watch that channel, but flipping through it from time to
time, one can't help but make note of this bizarre contemporary sci-fi
cinematic fetish for all these gooey looking excrescences that keep showing
up on film in the form of little gremlins of every size and shape.  Tonight,
at last, I perceived the Freudian symbolism in that stuff--as it is now
showing itself forth in the unconscious projections, the Durkheimian
*conscience collectif* of every generation born since Roe v. Wade.  It's
just the sort of aborted fetal flesh thing you Gen-Xers have oozing around
in your heads, all these guilt built gooey fantasms that keep popping up
and splattering like pimple juice all over the screen in your art.
The very thing your generation has been forced to suppress is kept
buried down in the darkest archetypal depths of your collective
unconsciousness, being squeezed out in all these movies and upon
triggers in every High School Mass Shooting, it's all that dark, gooey wrath
in that muttering hiphop chant of lunacy you are sold as "music."

You watch the utterly orgiastic expression on Ms Leigh's face (and she has
been for some time, in my view, one of the few young actresses that is worth
a damn) when she is shooting somebody--and you see in that fantastically
crazed expression, all the sensuality of a human ego in the rarely
recognized state of expressing the righteousness of evil--it's how people
look when they fully know somewhere down inside the absolute wrongfulness of
what they do, and yet at the same time are giving full vent to the ethically
blind Id animal down inside with its volcanically explosive need to say,
despite the Super Ego's knowledge, "I am justified. I deny the
guilt!  I get to do what I want."  Every murder of passion is done in that
state of mind, every act of hair-splitting dishonesty is backed by that same
passion, and there is no arguing with you about it.

It might only be noted in passing that the only real "feminist" worthy of
the name is Camille Paglia who admits that abortion is homocide, but is
nonetheless justified in Woman's War Against Nature. Women must recognize
the killing of the fetus as an act of defense against the "chthonic forces"
of nature that have always been pitted against Woman.  Now she fights back
with deadly force.  She is Lady MacBeth; her hands *are* bloody and all the
perfumes of Arabia cannot remove the stain, she must face it and live with
it, not by telling herself lies about it, but face the truth of herself as a
guerilla fighter in the ongoing fight that Woman must wage against Nature's
genocidal plot against Woman.

No, I don't give my sanction Paglia in that, any more than I give it to John
Dillinger, I only honor her honesty in stating it, as one can plainly see
what a bunch of gangsters and Che Guevarra's the women of Gen-X have
become--it's not very pretty.
