This is still an issue.  Level 45 Bard here.   I was grouped in
Karnor's last night and I charmed a Skeletal Guardian and had it
attack the Drolvarg the group was fighting.  After we killed the
Drolvarg, my pet turned on the monk in our group and the pet would not
respond to attacking another mob that I had targeted.  I broke the
charm and my group killed the guardian.  I must say it was quite
unexpected.

Hopefully this will be fixed with today's patch.

Anyone other bards notice that swarm/charm kiting is not working quite
like it used to?
