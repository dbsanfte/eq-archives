It's going to be ready *very* soon, there are a couple of GM's
in the Bazaar on the Test server right now, trying it out.

And while you can apparently right-click on a PC flagged "Trader",
you can *also* open a search window which lets you, for example,
search for all neck slot items wearable by a dwarf paladin
which give +WIS.  It will then show you *ALL* such items for
sale in the Bazaar which  match the criteria, along with their
asking price and which "Trader" PC has them for sale.

So if there are 12 different people selling the Necklace of Uberness,
you can instantly pick the one who is asking the lowest price
for it.  So it's quite similar to what he was suggesting.
