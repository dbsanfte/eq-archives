Okay, for characters level 6 and over, a corpse will stay for one week
offline, 24 hours online; however, "online" includes time playing on
ANY other characters on your account, not just your paladin.  So if
you were playing another character during those four days, and the
total playing time added up to over 24 hours, that still counts as
your "online" time.
