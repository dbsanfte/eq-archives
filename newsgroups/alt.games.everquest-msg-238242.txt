But I'm just wondering, if that was the case and he told SOE that
somebody had gotten his account name and password and then changed the
password (and then played the characters for a while), wouldn't SOE
refuse to let the original player reclaim the account, but instead
just ban the account and tell the original player they shouldn't have
given out their name and password to other people?
