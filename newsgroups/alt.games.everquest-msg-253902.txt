First, you also don't have to be in range of the target to get Intimidation
skill ups. When running from qeynos to south karana, I would target a new
mob right after zoning and then spam the Intimidation hotkey across the
entire zone. You will get skill ups even if the target is out of range,
and has the added advantage that you won't agro the target in the (unlikely)
event that you succeed. Just be careful when doing this in town that you
make sure you're targetting a mob or faraway guard rather than the vendor
you just browsed...

Second, Intimidation has a really wierd skill learning curve. It's glacial
to improve until around 75-80. You'll notice a real learning speed improvement
around there.
