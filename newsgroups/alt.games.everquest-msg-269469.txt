My husband was soloing so that he could catch up to my level and we were
aghast at the disparity between "group" (ie, duo) xp and solo xp. As a
soloer he got .25% per solo encounter, encounters that were challenges for
a 19 bard, and he regularly came within a breath of dying.  As a duo, able
to take on green "group" encounters, we got 2% per encounter and it took
us no more time to kill than his solo encounters.

Same amount of time...but .25% to 2%.  That is ABSURD.  SOE is going much
much too far on this.
