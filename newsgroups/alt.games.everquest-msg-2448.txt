The most fun I have had is starting over on a new server (I've been in
on day one on two different servers)  You get what you earn, and go
get what you need.  Sadly, I can't play enough to stay ahead of the
hump, and eventually you get drowned in the mush of all of the other
players.  I almost wish everything in the game was no-drop and you
used what you earned.  But as long as level 5's have full crafted, I
don't really care how they got it, one way is as good as another.
