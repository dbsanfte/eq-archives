Tailoring is mildly profitable because you loot most of what you use.  I
used to get a trickle of cash by carrying stacks of patterns around and
sewing ruined pelts.  Below level 10, I found a profit of almost 1 gold per
item woven was very nice indeed.  I've since given up the ruined pelts, but
I still do the same thing with silk swatches at a profit of about 4 gold per
item.  This isn't much, but after you've done 100 of them you find you've
got an extra 40 plat in the bank.  Since my life savings in game is
currently about 300, 40 is still nothing to sneeze at.  Doing this raises
your Tailoring to boot, albeit slowly.  Soon I expect I'll have a reasonable
chance at making tailored backpacks, and those ought to go for 80-100p each.
With a price like that, so what if HQs are rare?

Also, IMHO, Tailoring is THE skill to use if you are new to the game and/or
unable to twink a new character.  You can weave your own bandages and  bags.
You can weave your own armor to start with, and it might only be tattered
but it's tons better than your own baby-soft skin.  That armor lasts, too:
at level 15 I'm still wearing 1/3 of my original tatters, and half the stuff
I've replaced I've replaced with studded.  I'm also using Tailored Large
Bags (gotta love that weight reduction) in four inventory slots.  Tailoring
might not be worth a bucket of cash, but you get a bunch of small benefits.
It's the gift that keeps on giving.
