[snip c&p of the news]

Still no word on what specifically is included or not such as if they
are raising level cap.  I kept hearing rumor that level 70 won't be
the max but if I were to guess, it won't be this one because the last
2 times the cap were raised it was the 4th expansion )PoP) and 8th
expansion (OoW).  PoR is the 11th one and if SoE is consistient the
level cap should be this fall not this March.

I do hope this expansion fixes a few broken skill up path.  Right now
there's no easy way to get 300 fletching or 300 tailoring for most
races/classes.

No idea what free bonus would be included with the presell of digital
download but I'll bet the retail box with a Warhorse mount bonus is as
cheesey as the retail DoD version, only good for sit regen.
