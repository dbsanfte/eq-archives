}Sorry? What do you mean?
}Only thing you gotta do is:
}Invis, go into graveyard, pickup bag-wise graphic (flower) from
}coffin in chapel, go around chapel, give flower to the shadowed
}woman, and gate out...

What he probably means is, "I have bad Sol Ro faction."  This will result 
in Ssynthi not accepting the flower you so graciously offer.

Two solutions:

1.  If your faction is bad but not terrible, collect derv rings and 
deliver them to the named orc Ortallius in South Ro.  I think it was 30 or 
40 rings to a faction level.

2.  Kill Shadowed Men.  Lots and lots and lots of shadowed men.  Yell to 
the zone if anything interesting drops...  Hand of Shadow, Eye of Shadow, 
Mask of Shadow, Shadowed Rapier, Patch of Shadow, etc, etc.  It's mostly 
no-rent, but there may be someone out there who's just that one bit shy of 
being able to complete their chosen quest.  And you'll be there long 
enough to see them each a -lot-.  Believe me.
