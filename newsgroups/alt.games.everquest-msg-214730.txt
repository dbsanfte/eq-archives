A big enough pool to deal with your situation, yes.  A much bigger pool, no, not
really.  If you stand up to save someone with a SOW, then you can do it at one
bub of mana just as easily as at three bubs.  Enough healing to save someone's
bacon, too, comes out of less than a bub of mana.  I'm not, however, suggesting
that you should kill things that require 4 bubs of my mana bar or 2 bubs of
yours, I'm rather suggesting that you should be killing mobs that suck up about
one bub of mana (mine, half a bub of your bar) each, since they tend to yeild
more exp per hour

But having more HP does the same thing; when things go bad, you can tough out
the fight, or you can run away; both may not be options for the low HP shaman.
Thing is, low on mana, nothing changes, other than when you really bottom out,
you can't cast the high mana cost spells anymore. Low on HP, you get low HP
aggro, you lose running speed, and you therefore much more easily wind up dead.
Root is cheap, if you need to control an add and for some reason don't want to
run away, its very unlikely that you'll have mana for a root but I won't.  I'll
grant you that someone with a much larger mana pool can kill more mobs at a
single time than someone with a large HP pool (provided we are talking only
shaman under level 24, or non shaman), but that doesn't mean he can kill more in
an hour, thats my point.  IN fact, its possible the shaman with the larger HP
pool will kill more mobs per hour.... lets look at why.

Shaman trade HP for mana, and mana for HP.  A swap, where you get your HP right
back to where you started, leaves you with more mana than  you started with.
But if you have lots of HP left, in a tense situation you don't have to swap,
you just canni down, going into HP deficit spending.   The larger your pool, the
more you are able to do this, which means you can kill harder targets or handle
tougher situations than you could if using deficit spending would get you into
low HP aggro sooner, or get you dead sooner.  The more you are able to use
canni, the more mana flow you have, net, so having more situations where you can
use canni means having faster mana regen on average.  I've already pointed out
that having a higher mana pool doesn't increase your mana regen one bit, not on
average, not under any circumstances.

Thats not all, though.  Another way shaman can boost their mana flow is to
deliberately canni down under 50%, and then have their melee buddies (who have
nothing worthwhile to do during down times), bards,  and casters or hybrids who
are FM or have mounts use bind wounds on them.  This is mana free healing, and
can be very effective at eliminating down time.  Sadly this is less useful than
it could be, since down time should be eliminated where possible in a good
group; but in the case of overpulls which strain the mana pool of the shaman,
this will dramatically reduce his recharge time.  Thing about this is, the more
HP he has, the more HP 50% of his HP bar is, so the more effectively he can do
this.
