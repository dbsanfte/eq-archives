Was in DL waiting on the spires last night.  15 minutes, 5 minutes, 3
minutes, 1 minute, about to activate.

Cleric and warrior...cleric starts to cast complete heal...

Norrath spires begin to cast a spell...

Warrior hits Scion for 22, 54,3...

Scion hits warrior for 1791, 345, 352...

Complete heal lands....

All parties ported up...

I zone fast, and see Onee pop into the Nexus with about
-4 billion hitpoints, at which point WHILE SHE'S STILL
ZONING, her hps climb all the way to full.

Her and the cleric laugh and laugh.
