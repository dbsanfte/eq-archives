Everquest is based on gratification...kinda obvious, but something DAOC
didn't have (at least at the start, I stopped playing about 9 months ago).

"Oh, I can't wait til I get to level 14, Spirit of Wolf...woot!" (druid)
"Oh, can't wait to get to level 12...dual wield!!" (or whatever level
warriors get that :)

The game has actually been out for 3.5 years and you're going to find a lot
of regular players who have been around since even beta.

As for FIRST character, yeah, I'd probably choose a melee-type...just to get
your feet wet.  Don't get too attached to him though.

I'd recommend you pick a race that can see at night (leaves Erudites, Humans
and Barbarians off the list) and pick a starting town and newbie area that
are easy enough to get around.  Halflings start in Rivervale and that'd be
my pick, especially if you go with Rogue to start.  The toughest part about
RV is that when you die you come back (your bind-point) in Misty Thicket
(the newbie hunting grounds) kinda far (IMO) from the hole back to
Rivervale.  Another option would be Iksar...their town isn't horribly
confusing, and the newbie zones are very nice.  IF YOU BUY SHADOWS OF LUCLIN
DON'T CREATE A CAT.  Your system won't handle the horrible frame rate and
it'll only make you hate the game if that's your first experience.

Dark Elves are cool but their city may be confusing...their newbie area is
horribly confusing.
Dwarves are cool...the starting bind point is easily within view of your
starting city...but the starting city itself (Kaladim) is a bit confusing as
well.
Gnomes have a bitch of a newbie area...lots of things are aggressive to
you...and are also higher level.  Ak'Anon (their city) is noisy. :p
Ogres newbie zone is kinda ugly...town is easy enough though
Troll's newbie zone is ugly AND confusing.  I haven't been in town much.
