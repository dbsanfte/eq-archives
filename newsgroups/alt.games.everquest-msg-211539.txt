I have more than a bit of a problem swallowing the idea people are making 6
figure salaries off EQ.

A quick scan of playerauctions showed just over $500 being the max price
placed on an account with any actual bids, which was for a 65 paladin,
200+AA, elemental flagged, etc, etc, etc.   And 700 was the greatest price
anyone was even asking, that I saw in my quick scan.

Even assuming an unlimited demand of people willing to pay $700 for an
account,  to make 100,000 in a year, you would need to sell 143 accounts in
a year.  (Not counting the $10,000 that you would spend for software and
expansion packs to start 143 accounts....  well, lets just use gross numbers
for simplicity)

365 days in a year (assuming you take no time off to eat or sleep or
anything.)... that means you would have to turn out a level 65 +AA well
equipped, elemental flagged character once every 2.5 days.   Not even Martin
powerlevels that fast!

Not to mention, if you were working 365 days a year, 24 hours a day at
McDonalds, even at $7 an hour, once you figured in 128 hours of overtime
each week, if you'd be pushing $100k a year there as well... :P
