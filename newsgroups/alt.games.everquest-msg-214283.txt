For what it's worth, Leah, I absolutely HATED  EQ when I first started
playing, I despised it and wanted to just kill every character I ran across.
I hated having to retrieve my body, hated having to group with people, hated
damn near everything about it ... I quit playing for a while (my husband and
I share an account so it was still active)  .. then I started playing again
and now I'm hooked.  I don't mind dying so much anymore.  While it can be
irritating at times, it's not that big a deal to have to run back and grab
my bod.  if it's in an unsafe place I can just drag it to a safe place
before retrieving my gear.

Grouping is cool now too, I find bad groups sometimes, but the awesome
groups I've found make up for it.  I've gotten used to the workings of the
game now and will soon have my own account .. and have to start completely
over because my characters are not good enough yet to pay for transferring
them, but already have the characters picked out that I'm going to play and
can't wait to get started again :)

If you want to try it out, I'd suggest just getting the EQ classic ($4.90 at
www.gogamer.com) and giving it a shot ... if ya don't like it you've not
wasted much money on it that way.  The expansions do give a lot of options
that classic doesn't have, but it is at least a way to wiggle around in it
to decide if it's worth the money to really give it a go.
