Greetings,

Currently as a level 50 Iksar Beastlord I love soloing, and have done
so I would say for 50% of my experience. I know many people will
scream, but hey Lake of Ill Omen is a great place to go from level 14
till like 30 for some good experience. Then I would advise going to
Warsilk Woods around level 26, and solo the Forest Greenwoods, then
later the Forest Evergreens in the Giant fort there (They drop Forest
Loops from time to time, and pathing there is great so you can pull
and usually not get jumped).

As far as weapons, I would suggest getting a hold of the following : 

Polished Steel Ulak (saw them for sale in EC for 150pp-400pp) H2H
Harpoon of the Depths (LOIO drop that sells for less than 100p) OR
Slime Coated Hapoon (Sells for around 600p - maybe less) Piercing
**(check prices as these are on Quellious and what I might have paid
when I got them)**

Obviously if you have more plat get better but these are what I used
and still do from time to time - the stats are nice, etc.

By level 30 with new pet they still give okay experience, and become
even easier to kill. If you can stand the lag, then move on to
Frontier Mountains, and try the Giants there, but soloing there is
tough as pathing is a big issue -- but loot and group experience is
nice. However, if you do like I did go to The OverThere, but enter it
through Warsilks and look for the Mobs there that are around 20's-30's
(tend to be more on the right side), but be careful there of the
goons, and some cons that are big undercons (like Sabretooth Tigers -
Tigresses are much easier).

It becomes very hard to solo between 39 and 49 because our pet is like
level 35 and by the time you reach 48 it cons green to you, but once
you hit 49...very nice advancement. Basically you'll be able to solo
in places you were grouped earlier with the greatest of ease. I am
currenty soloing Ragers, and the occasional Ravishing Drolvangs in The
Dread Lands, and despite the penalty for pet doing 51% more damage I
am moving along nicely there (should be 51 by this Friday I would
say). I hate KC with a passion. KC is just a giant castle with Trains
running through it every 3 minutes, avoid it if you can (unless
properly grouped, or on raid).

After 49 if you are gonna solo, I recommend Emerald Jungle, or Burning
Wood (or just grab a spot and solo in Dread Lands). I am dying to try
to get a decent group and go back into BW, as it really was great xp
at 49, whether soloing or grouped.

Hope this helped a bit.
