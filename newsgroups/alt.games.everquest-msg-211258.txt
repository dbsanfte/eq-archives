    A lot of teens today are quite tolerant because it's part of the culture
now. The older generations grew up being told that being gay was just wrong,
and there weren't any openly gay role models to contradict that. That's why
I think average Joe Teen is more tolerant than average Bob Adult.

    Having said that, of the people that aren't tolerant, I think the teens
are more likely to spout off to try and prove themselves in front of the
group.

    And that's my handwaving pop psych post for the day.
