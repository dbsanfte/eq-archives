Hi everyone:

I'm at a loss on what to do regarding AA experience, so hopefully I can get
a little insight that might help me here. I've just made level 51 and would
like to invest my experience into running speed ASAP. Getting normal
experience in level 51 is slow, but at least there are still plenty of blue
cons around for me to hunt. If I start putting *all* of my experience
towards AA right now, I can (slowly) improve my player base stats, but what
happens if I wait to do AA until say level 60? My assumption is that there
are less blue mobs around at level 60 than there are at level 51, and taking
into account I play on Stormhammer, a large population of players are level
60 anyway, thus making blue cons a bit harder to find due to so many people
looking for them.

I have no idea how the AA system is designed to work *experience* wise and
have tried to ask a few of my friends on-line if level 52 is *easier* than
51. Just about everyone that I've spoken to tell me that 52 is slightly
easier than 51, so I'm wondering if I should just wait to do AA until I ding
52.

Sorry to seem rather vague about what I'm doing with my experience, if you
can, please give me some advice that might help .. In summing up: What's the
*best* level to start putting my exp towards AA?

Good hunting to you all ...

Stevie.
