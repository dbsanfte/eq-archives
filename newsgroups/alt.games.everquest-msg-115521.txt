Aviak Isle

The mobs are indifferent but will help their comrades when you start on one.

The guy whacking em was probably trying to make the two names spawn, one who
drops an ingot for some cleric quest and the other drops an Ebon War Spear,
nice SHM weapon that can be held in range slot for stats also

Other people go there to wipe em out to collect the talons which can be
handed in at Butcher Block for exp.. good for PLing a low level up
