Here's the trouble with top posters.  They're all too fucking lazy to
do anything other than click on Reply, type what they want, and click
on Send.

The number of people who include the *entire* 500-line prior post when
top posting *way* exceeds the number who include it when bottom
posting.

Yes, I have documentation.  I happen to be a researcher with the
prestigious firm of Top Posters Are Wankers Inc.  My records are all
available on microfiche for those with suitable clearance.

Just FYI.
