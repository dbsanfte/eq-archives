As I understand the focus items, a level III item affects *all* spells
up to level 60.   So a level 1 twink with the relevant foci items all
at level III just won't ever need to replace them (until he gets
the same effect on better equipment....)

So casters want to replace their gear with level III items as soon as
possible since they won't magically lose the effect when they level
and start using new spells.

Still, I know (and generally agree) with what you're saying.  They've
essentially lowered the bar on encounters across the board, at
least those which aren't controlled by timesinks (VT, any of the
Ring encounters) and those which aren't magic resistant.

Twenty percent more mana-based damage (without additional
players, levels, etc) means faster kills means less healing needed
(and secondary healers got better too) means less "capable"
tanks are needed etc etc etc...
