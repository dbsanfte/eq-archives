Just to be confirm, yes, I did call EQ an ignorant idiot.  I also
called him a bigot, and maybe one or two other things as well.   As
you have picked up, I did not deny this.  I don't call people names
lightly, but when I do I'm honest about it.  This makes it all the
more puzzling that EQ would feel the need to get creative and
imaginative with my posts.   I *did* insult him, so why the need to
invent more insults?
