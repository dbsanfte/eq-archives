I have a very well organized book, but I think for swapping single
spells this might be faster.  My swap spot sees things from self
buffs (TPP, Shielding) to Summons (Foci usually) to Pet stuff, to
"General" (Gate, Bind, Invis, See Invis, CoH).  They are grouped
by use - and I think swapping that spot will be faster with this
than /book 15, click Mod Rod, Click Spell slot, ctrl+shift+b to
stand.
