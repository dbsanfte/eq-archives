Personally, I'm one of those druids that has found a horse very effective 
(in outside zones anyway) for keeping my mana up. I am almost never out of 
mana unless a pull goes bad and I have to ghetto mez, heal, doT, nuke, and 
snare all at the same time. If you have the money, a mount is very useful 
for managing your mana easier.

Oh, and I'd say that you are doing exactly what a druid is supposed to do. 
Most of the time I play main healer (though I enjoy playing more when a 
cleric is nearby) buff, evac duty, doT every chance I get, snare and blast.

As far as missing your epic, I have mine and I'm glad I got it. But I didn't 
get it because of the extra Dot it would give me. The damage isn't all that 
great. I only got mine because it was a goal that I set out to do when I 
first made my character.
