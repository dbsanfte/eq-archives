In order, and as best I'm able:
1)  Stackable words, pages, writs, and runes are all components that INT
based characters use for creating higher level spells;  starting at 16th (?)
I beleive, so you're getting closer.  Others have better knowledge on
strategies for Using/increasing the Spell research skill, or getting others
to 'combine' the items you would need to make your spells.

2) Foods are categorized as snack, meal, hearty meal, feast, banquet (or is
it banquet, feast?) for how long they will last.  Many player-made food
items will also improve or lower stats if they are the first food in your
inventory ( Blackened Tier'Dal is +1 DEX +1 AGI +2 INT).  Foraged drink
doesn't last as long as store-bought (I think they are called 'whistle
whetters').  Alcoholic drinks will not sate any thirst, just make you drunk
and build your Alcohol Tolerance level.

3)  I've sen Giants drop coppers, and goblins drop platinum; the money
system in Norrath is screwy.  At your level, and most any level FTM, money
is made selling loot; either to vendors or to players. Newbie skeletons
sometimes carry a Cracked Staff, which can sell to vendors for 8 gold even
with my lousy CHR.  HQ Bear Skins (pelts?) sell to player-tailors for 25-45
platinum depending on server and player need.  Willowisps sometimes drop
Lightstones or Greater Lightstones which can be either sold to players or
used in a quest in NK (Oasis too?) for 6-8 platinum.  Some orcs in EC, WC,
and Misty carry Deathfist belts that players will buy for a quest in
Freeport, or they drop chainmail pieces (still?  or not?) that sell to
vendors for 20+ platinum.

4)  Buildings won't save you.  If its KOS to you, and within its aggro
range, chances are it will jump you.  Sitting to rest in an INN , and a Lion
walked by outside.  he came through the wall to nibble on me...I sold his
pelt to the vendor standing next to me =).  As you get higher into the game,
you will probably find uses for that ghostly ability, and pull critters
through walls.
