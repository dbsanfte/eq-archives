This would be a massive improvement, I never noticed it with my
little druid alt, but then he's a snare/DD kiter far more than a root/DOT
killer.  Of course in a group environment druid roots suck because
they all have a damage component, causing them to break mez.

Clerics have two lines of root, one "quick and short duration" one
"slow and long duration" but because of the frequent break checks,
on mobs of decent level, there's been no reason really to cast the
long duration ones.  Might have to check now that resists have
been changed, on lower level mobs perhaps the long duration ones
will at least tend to hold out full length.
