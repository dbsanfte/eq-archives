I'm still not convinced that removing the spellbook is a completely good thing, 
and your arguments about being able to see better in dungeons is very, very 
weak.  I am in a raiding guild, but I still do single group crawls.  I have a 
bare-minimum spec computer so I spent a LOT of time looking at the ground.  I am 
also the CCer in almost every single group I'm in.  (Hell, I've split CC duties 
with another bard on Trak runs, including King, Juggs, and Reets.)  I almost 
NEVER can see adds, because I'm either staring at the mob I'm fighting, OR 
staring at the ground.  In any case, when there is an add, one of the other 
group members calls it, I peel off, and deal with it.  I then go back to melee 
and again look directly at the ground.  I don't think there is anyone I've 
grouped with in the past 20 levels who will say I'm anything short of an 
extremely competant CCer.  
If a BARD can CC effectively without seeing much of anything, then I can't see 
how a cleric or an enchanter would have that much trouble.

Lullaby is pretty useful up until bards get Pixie Strike.  At that point, they 
should be learning to use Pixie Strike, since Lullaby becomes useless at 30 at 
the very latest.  Bards can CC almost as well as enchanter from 15-59.  At 60 
enchanters get dictate, and then they're useful on 56+ mobs, which bards can't 
CC.  On Norrath, the ONLY exp camps where a bard isn't able to CC is Juggs, and 
not many folks consider that an exp camp.  
With a slower or a feign puller, a group with a bard should be able to do any 
dungeon, and any exp camp.  Plus we add haste and mana regen, unlike those gimpy 
necros.  :)
