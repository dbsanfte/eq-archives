Lately I've kinda stalled playing my druid, so I decide to start
playing my ranger again who's been at 50 for well over a year now.  I
dump about 20k on equipment, including a Twisted Longbow and a shiny
new Tolan's bracer.  

Things are going well and I ding 51 last night.  Tonight I log on and
after trying vainly to find a group anywhere (Stupid people SLEEPING
at 2am), I trot out to EW and start hunting rhinos and mammoths.  I
see a rhino in the distance so I plink an arrow out to pull it and get
the message telling me I've done DOUBLE the damage with my bow.
Unfortunately it's only 4 so I don't quite understand.  I plink at it
as I'm bringing the rhino back to my pull spot and just get normal
damage messages so oh well.  

I fear kite and tear through the rhino in short order.  When it's
running (below 20% health running) and not going anywhere because it's
snared, I back off and pump some arrows into it and I get the double
damage message again.  Now my muddled brain kicks in and I remember
reading somewhere that rangers get double damage on all non-rooted
stationary mobs.  I'm giddy, particularly when I see the 202 damage
crit hit.

Anywho, to make a long story short ("Too late!") I'm curious about
what I can expect to see from my archery skill in the future.  Is
there anything else in particular I'm going to need to know?  Is there
any webpages in particular I need to be looking at?  I've made a very
cursory exploration of the Rangers Glade message board
(http://forums.interealms.com/ranger/) and found out some interesting
stuff, but I'm just curious if there's anything else out there. 

Thank you all and dog bless.
