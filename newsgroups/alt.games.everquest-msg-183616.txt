LOL, I wouldn't :�)
I don't actually intend on making a Froglok, I don't require one. If they
could be Mages or Beast Lords then maybe but I have all the classes they can
be in other races and can't really be bothered to repeat myself just for a
Froglok, I am still  pleased they introduced the Race tho.

How many Froggies on FV? Seeing as it is 1 character per account there, did
the server suddenly get an influx of new players?
