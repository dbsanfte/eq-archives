Excuse me?  Bards were pretty seriously bugged.  Like I was getting locked into 
a single song at LEAST once a minute.  Sometimes 5 times in a 60 second period.  
OK, it's only one class, but pretty damn annoying.  Imagine if Warriors could 
only use primary hand weapons.

Hitsmode is the new toy they have.  They want to make it nice, and they really 
did need to fix bards, might as well fix several minor bugs.

I suspect that the EXP bonanza is still in effect.  The downtime wasn't that 
big, and I suspect that the real reason was the ability to make huge plat 
enchanting metal and then selling back more bars than you bought (thanks mage 
focus items).
Of course I don't care what else they did, as long as they fixed bards.  I think 
bards must just not bitch enough.  (Many high-level bards I know don't want to 
bitch because we're afraid a close look would convince Verant that we're 
overpowered and lead to massive nerfing.)
