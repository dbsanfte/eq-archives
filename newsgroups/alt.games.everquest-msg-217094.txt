I'd been thinking along those lines myself, not sure too many people
would be keen on writing off the LDoN points though.

You NEED a Cleric, CC and a hefty plate tank in my opinion.  No way
you can afford to have 2 or 3 unsecured hard mission mobs whacking
random group members for 900 a pop.

Would need to massively overheal until things got under control and
any adds that didn't mez *very* quickly would probably be the end of
you.  

>Do mobs there mitigate slow? 

Yes.  Even stuff 10 feet from the zone in point.

>Can a chanter mez there easily if you assume tash and malo? 

Mmm.  A lot of the normal mobs are level 65 so on that fact alone
expect a fairly hard time of it unless he or she has those nifty Rune
AAs and a fair chunk of HPs.

>Any guesstimate as to hitpoints on the mobs? 

Roughly 20-25k on yard trash I guess, no clue on named as I was too
busy trying not to die.

>Can a bard dependably pull singles on hard?

No clue.  Two or three pulls if the group is ready for them are quite
survivable as I've not come across too much that summons.

Go really, really, really, really slowly and don't expect named to
spawn every time.  Bah.
