I have been doing without recently in EQ 1, due mainly to a decrease
in buffers casting temp and sow, got some xp for various of my
'toons. But I have to go back to town or a safe place much more
often. And that is only due to combat with blues. Maybe buffers went
to Wow and EQ2...

I have noticed the guild invites have increased in quantity as well.
