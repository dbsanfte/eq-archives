Yes, that "slanty area" is your way in and way out of that long nice strip
for laps.
But if you're already in the Freeport area why not just head to the North
Freeport area and swim back and forth along the shoreline there?  I got both
my enchanter and my ranger over 100+ skill points by swimming back and forth
from the Barbarian camp there to Oasis and back while they were fighting in
Oasis.  It was always easy to keep the coastline in site so I knew which way
to head if I started to drown.
