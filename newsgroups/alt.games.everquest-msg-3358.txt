Practice your grouping skills in Highpass. Fast, safe exp in a group,
you fight close enough to the zone to get there without sow, with sow
it's actually hard to die. You might want to start with Gnolls, they
are a little lower, good for 15-18, orcs are good from 16-20. Good
faction, tons of tradeskill areas for when you need a break, and
merchants steps from the spawn points. A couple nice items drop
(Cracked Darkwood Shield and Polished Granite Tomahawk from gnolls,
Shiny Brass Idol, Halberd and the Shralok Pack from orcs). There's
also a bank nearby inside the keep.
