Go here:  http://www.eqatlas.com/atlas.html
copy maps - print maps - learn maps.

In answer to your question, High Hold borders 3 zones, High Keep
(but you knew that), Kithicor Forest and East Karana.  LOIO is on
the continent of Kunark, you are presently on the continent of
Antonica, (but you knew that).  ;-)

At level 28, you can easily solo Aviaks and Centaurs in South
Karana.  Other than an occasional cyclops, there is nothing very
dangerous in the zone.  Go there - kill lots - level much.
