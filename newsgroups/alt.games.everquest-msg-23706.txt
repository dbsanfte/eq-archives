Another nice hot key to setup is a buff hotkey

something like

/raise I call on the power of Tunare to strengthen %T
/cast 1
/pause 100, /cast 2
/pause 70, /cast 3
/pause 80, /cast 4
/book

http://express.stratics.com/Issue153/emotes.htm
You may now enter pauses in social batches with the /pause command. /pause
takes an argument from 1 to 600, with the value being equal to the number of
tenths of seconds (i.e. /pause 100 will yield a 10 second pause).

For example, a social consisting of:

/sit off /cast 1 /pause 100 /sit on

...would cause you to stand up, cast the spell in slot 1, wait 10 seconds
after you've STARTED casting the spell, and sit down.

Furthermore, you can also use the /pause command on the same line as another
social by separating the commands with a comma. Even though the pause
command is specified first, it is executed AFTER the command on the same
line.

For example:

/sit off /pause 100,/cast 1 /sit on

...would have the same effect as the example above. It is important to note
that the comma can only be used to separate a /pause command from another,
and MUST be specified first on the line.
