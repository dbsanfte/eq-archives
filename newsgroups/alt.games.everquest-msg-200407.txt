Yep Very vocal on boards. And very small minority ... or won't say a word
about it ingame.
I have met or rather heard only one person who was ranting Kei and Pling are
evil in game. It just so happened to be a player gladly killing guards in
low level zones. Precisely getting guards killed by Mobs too strong to kill
himself and then finishing the mobs off. His response " noobs need to learn
to play the game ".

Its the same old nerf crowd. I played my rogue to 30 in banded and finally
got a SBD mentality. Did that been there.
I get the feeling they left the DAoC whineplay nerf boards long ago and
decided to come back here. These are the kind of players that always say
what they don't like and how it can be changed to hurt someone else's fun. I
have never seen an original thought, idea, concept or suggestion on how to
improve there own fun without hurting someone else's good time.
