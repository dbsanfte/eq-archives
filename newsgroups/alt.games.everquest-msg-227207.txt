Good point.  DKP should really be called Merit and Merit should be
called Buddy Award or Power Trip Award.

It's also quite possible to use DKP and not use auctioning, that's one
of the fucked up aspects of DKP, take it away and things run even
smoother.  In the system my old guild used if you wanted an item and
you had the highest DKP you got the item at the book price.  In time
mob and loot values would depreciate but if you were prepared to wait
six months to get an item at 'sale' prices and possibly miss out on it
altogether due to us no longer killing the mob then that was up to
you.
