No.  The .NET runtime is just the software for running new style .NET
applications, and
a big set of utility libraries to make it much easier to write programs
(simplifying a whole
lot here) Passport is microsoft's internet authentication mechanism and the
two are not
connected (except in so much as the .NET runtime libraries contain code to
make it easier
to use passport in application --- But nothing forces developers to make use
of it)

There is no problem with installing the .NET runtime at all as far as I
know. (As long as
you have enough disk space)
