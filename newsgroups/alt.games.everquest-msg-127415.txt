Just a hunch, but I may know where the difference is.  Bahrain permits
Catholicism, but doesn't "support" it.  Fillipinos, most of whom are
residents, as opposed to citizens are either not surveyed, or don't find
their religion on the surveys, because then Bahrain would have to "do
something about" it... and loose their cheap labor.  Hey, I said Bahrain is
more western, not that it was America.

I guess even my posting order is dyslexic.

Indeed.  Well, everyone's got their own viewpoints on this.  You and I
agreed in the early part of the discussion.

The difference is, when christians tag-team someone, everyone cries "foul"
(rightfully so).  When the Chistian gets tag-teames, everyone cries "get
him!"

Of course, it's my fault.  I should know I'm not going to find a large
concentration of Christian entusiasts for my hobbies.  Somehow I can't see
Pat Roberston playine EQ and watching anime.  Though it may do him some
good.
