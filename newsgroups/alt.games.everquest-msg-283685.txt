While waiting for downloads I've been doing a bit of reading
on the combine server and ran across some info that I haven't
seen here yet (that doesn't mean it wasn't here, just that I
missed it if it was :) )

#1 - an unofficial faq that answers some questions posted here
recently: http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?
board.id=Progression&message.id=12113

#2 - No newbie armor quests

#3 - Mobs level 20-50 are getting tweaked to offset the 
increased caster power from the rebalancing done a while back.

On average they have 18% more HP, lower AC and hit softer but
faster.  This is to make them more melee friendly.  OTOH - this
change seems to have affected pets as well, as mages are reporting
that their pets get beat down pretty easily now.  

This was unexpected, because anything that benefits melee should
have benefitted them.  With any luck it's simply a bug causing them
to have lower AC like their Mob counterparts.  

#4 - Shared Bank, Maps, LFG too (basically any UI thing that was
opened to all)

That's about everything I've run into that I haven't seen here.

(there was a post on zones, but I can't find it now)
