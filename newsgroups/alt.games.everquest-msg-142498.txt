In my bazaar, the cheapest I have ever seen an MTP for is 75pp each. I think
your server is selling them to eat, and our price is still geared toward
POTC. I expect to see the prices on them drop further.

I hate how much Halas meat pies have dropped- one person uses them to skill
up and wants to get rid of them at 3pp 9gp each- so everyone else has
dropped their prices to 5 or 7pp since then. Was selling them at 10pp each,
and couldn't keep them in stock. Sigh. I'm still buying wolf and mammoth
meat from players at 5pp a piece of meat. But you didn't tune into this
thread to listen to me bitch, so I'll kindly shut up now.
