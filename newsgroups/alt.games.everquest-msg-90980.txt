No, spoken like a logical and thoughtful person.

It's easy to slam VI, and get all pissy about scheduled down time and
patches. Your a perfect example of this Max. 

What is so hard about accepting the realities of coding and producing
a game that is played by hundreds of thousands of people from all over
the world? Things don't always work out like we want them too. The
people workling for Verant are human, and make mistakes. Maybe when
you grow up, move out of your parent's house, and get a real job, you
will understand.
