Old UI, We Hardly Knew Ye

After much faithful service, it's time for us to bid a fond farewell to
EverQuest's Classic and Velious user interfaces.  In yesterday's Test Server
patch, the old interfaces were disabled.

While adding many features to the new interface over the past six months,
including the built-in MP3 player, item links, compass, and enhanced /bug
reporting tool, we've done the best that we could to keep all three
interfaces, at the very least, usable.

However, some of the features that we've been quietly working on over the
past weeks have unfortunately forced our hand.

We don't want to spoil all of the upcoming changes at once, however, in
yesterday's Test Server update, we released the first run of the new
EverQuest windowed mode that's been in the works for quite some time now.
(In a game that was originally written for a much earlier version of
DirectX, it's a lot more work than many would think.)  Soon, it will behave
in a manner similar to other applications that support both full-screen and
windowed mode and can be toggled back and forth.  As a part of this change,
the account bans related to the use of third-party EverQuest windowing
applications have already been reversed.

In addition, the long-rumored "Bard Box" has also been revealed on the Test
Server.  For those who are not aware, we've been wanting to add a second
Effects window that would hold selected short-duration beneficial effects,
most notably many bard songs.  Initially, for tuning, the new effects area
will allow six additional songs to be placed upon your character.

These updates will remain on the Test Server only until after the new year,
as we expect that much additional testing will be required.

We hope you'll be as pleased with these latest changes as we are, and we
look forward to bringing you many new features in the coming months.
