Ypou know, you snivelling, whiney moron. There's a reason it's called
an "ETA". It stands for *ESTIMATED* Time of Arrival. Let me repeat
that first word in case it didn't get through that thick skull:
****ESTIMATED!!!!****. If that word is too big for you, try this one:
Guess. "We're shooting for this time, but it's not a promise".

Why the FUCK do so many people have such a difficulat time grasping
the concept of an estimate?
