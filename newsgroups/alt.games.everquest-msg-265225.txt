I have the potential to be an altaholic.  I wasn't in EQ1.  I also wasn't in
DAoC, until I got a char to level 50, which enabled my account for starting
new characters at 20, and now I'm an altaholic there.  I think I'll become
one in CoH.  It basically comes down to how fast I can level an alt up to the
point where it has has its main class defining powers.  In a lot of MMORPGs,
there is a tendency for the low levels to be very similar for all classes,
so alts start out retreading old ground, and there is a limit too how much
you can do that.  Sure, you can try different races to get different
starting areas, but the low level mobs are pretty much the same (as far as
behavior goes) in the different areas, so there is a limit to how much that
buys you.

Well, pretty much every game after EQ1 has had significantly less downtime,
and from what I've seem so far, EQ2 continues that trend.

I too am on the fence, but mainly because I don't think I want to take on
*two* new games close too each other, so I think it might be best to wait
for WoW to launch and see how that turns out (or at least wait until they
have an open beta).  Also, the next DAoC expansion is in December, which
will be their equivalent of LDoN (instanced dungeons), so that's probably
going to take up a lot of my time around then.  I think I can deal with
having three games that I'm bouncing around between, so one of EQ2 and WoW
will be added to CoH and DAoC as my semi-permanent set of games.  (I'll
probably be getting a Powerbook sometime before the end of the year, and WoW
will have a Mac client from the start, so that might be a point in their
favor.  It would be nice to have an MMORPG for the laptop).
