There was no need for you to respond to me at all.  You provided nothing
substantive from your first response to me to your latest.  And *I* am
looking for excuses to call you names and make you look bad?  No need to
look, you're throwing it in my lap, skippy.

Read the thread.  There haven't been many ideas.  Honestly, who do you ask
to chew your food for you?

If I find a little trick and crash less often, consistently, it hardly
qualifies as coincidence.  :p

Not hardly, though I'm sure you'd latch onto the first person that said they
still crash as proof that it doesn't work.  And cling to that single piece
of contrariness in the face of a thousand saying it did I'm equally sure.

And you still refuse to rub those two brain cells together hard enough to
grasp that I *don't* think the Bazaar dropping is in any way related to
bandwidth issues.  That was a side topic (not surprisingly, one in which you
grasp at semantic straws and obtusely refuse to acknowledge a perfectly
clear point because you'd rather argue).

I gave you my theory for a possible reason, but then you started grasping at
semantic straws there, yet again, and completely missed your chance to
comprehend, much less comment on, the point at issue.
