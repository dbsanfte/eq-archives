Define "tougher."

The tellurian pets are tank pets -- high HPs (and/or damage
mitigation), relatively low DPS.

Fire pets are wizard pets -- low HPs (and/or damage mitigation),
relatively high DPS.

Air pets are scout pets -- medium HPs (and/or damage mitigation),
relatively high DPS dependent upon mob/pet positioning (it's
better behind the mob with backstab, etc.)

Of course level makes a difference but I don't believe you see
that at level 20.   Both pets should still be your level;  I don't
believe the tellurian recruit becomes level-capped until 24.
I'd *guess* the level would reallly start to matter around 26
(when mobs would be orange to the pet) but not before.

The general rule is use earth (tellurian) pets for soloing
XP mobs;  other pets when grouping (or farming greys.)
