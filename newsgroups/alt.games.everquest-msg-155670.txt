}Doesn't the /face command or whatever work again now?

My understanding of the patch message was that they specifically 
-disabled- /face while under the influence of illusions.  Bother.  The 
only reason I can think of for them to do that was the problem with not 
reverting to your original look when the illusion wore off.  I didn't mind 
that as long as I could imitate other models that much more exactly.

/em feels nerfed.

The least they could do is activate those Illusion: Gender spells that 
have been on test since forever to make up for it...
