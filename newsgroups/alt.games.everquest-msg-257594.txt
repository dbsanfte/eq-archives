Who cares ? He is talking about *Brewing*,would be a waste
to spend time on raising wis,just click away,but I agree a
"Fermentation device" is a good investment.

Anecdotal observations on my 65 Ranger and 54 Pally:
Wanted to raise pottery for "Vial of Velium Vapor",
because fail rate at 122 pottery began to annoy me.

Spent a lot of time upping Rng's wis by looking for cheap
wis items in bazaar and swapping wis gear from my other
chars,result was at 280 Wis out of 200 pottery combines
at 186 I got *ZERO* skill gain.
Some days later after I had calmed down from this,I was 
in the mood to try it with Pally again,he has 156 Wis unbuffed,
this time I decided not to care about wis and mindlessly clicked
away,400 combines later he was at 199 pottery,while the
65 Rng with 280 wis was still at 186. */rude at EQ's RNG*
