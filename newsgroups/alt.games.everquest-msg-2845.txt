A Note to add to this.  If you aggro something on the run from the LOIO to
Fironia Vie make sure that you
do a quick camp once you get to the city.  I once aggroed a few things on a
run like that and granted the guards got rid of the ones that were right on
my tail, but when I went to go make the run back I found that not only the
spiders but also some high level goblin came from nowhere(I had never seen
him before and still have yet to see him again) and ganked me(this was when
I was only 25 or so).  The only thing I could think of was that the hate
list got passed along while I was in Firionia.
