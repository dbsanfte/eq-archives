Mobs just seem easier to lock down with a bard pulling if I slow then
malos. With whatever the debuff is that he uses, it's rare to have
both my slow, VP and his mez resisted and if that does happen, I'd
rather I have the agro while he mezzes. Bard pulling is about the only
situation where I'll slow before casting Malos though.

It's counterintuitive but other than a few extreme cases I find that
the group's DPS is never a major factor in how fast a group completes
a LDoN, normal or hard. 

Our smoothest, fastest groups in a hard LDon tend to have one, maybe
two DPS classes in them. The bard, main healer and my shaman are
pretty much never contributing to the DPS in those groups and the tank
isn't contributing much. Bard is out pulling as soon as the last mob
in camp is engaged and I'm busy watching for the bard's next pull so I
can be ready to debuff it as soon as it gets to camp.

How long would you say that it takes you to pull a single in a Hard
LDoN? 30 seconds on average? ... and I think you have to be an
exceptional monk or SK to keep the pull times that low unless it's an
easy dungeon layout where you don't have to abort many pulls.  

The difference isn't that it takes the monk an extra 10 seconds to
pull, it's that it takes the monk 30 seconds to pull and the bard 0
seconds (in the sense that the slowed and debuffed mob is already in
camp and waiting to be killed before the previous one is dead). 

Even if the monk's DPS is dropping the time to kill a mob from 45
seconds to 35, I think that's where the difference in completion times
come from.

I do consider that part of pulling, or maybe I should call it
pulling/CC. Whatever you want to call it, it helps to get a mob locked
down faster.

Good point. Once people start hitting exp mobs that are higher that
65th lvl, a lot of what I'm saying might well go out the window
because the standard spells won't affect those mobs. Do monks get an
upgrade to their lull in OoW?

I share your dislike for the lull series of spells but I doubt that it
will ever be changed. EQ seems to be following the boring path of just
making mobs hit so hard that groups have no choice other than to do
singles pulls. I guess it fits the play style of a lot of people, see
that thread a couple of weeks ago about not wanting randomness in
encounters, but I've always hated it. My most fun times in EQ weren't
pulling single difficult mobs in PoP. It was pulling and dealing with
trains in places like the Hole or Sebilis.
