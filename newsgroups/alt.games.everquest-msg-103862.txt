My level 52 druid with 203 wisdom and another +70 in mana items
meds from empty to full in about 14 minutes no mana regen effects.
Did some tests recently with a bard friend. His mana song reduced that
to 9 minutes.

When I was 14th level I remember timing my mana regen at almost
exactly 5 minutes, plus I had crap wisdom. Back when I was a newbie and
thinking that the downtime in EQ was absolutely stupid. LOL! I had no clue
as to how bad it got!
