Unless you plan on never typing any words with the letter "t" in them
again (try it some time) you don't. What you want to do is just make a
hot key for it and keep it in one of your battle slots when fighting.

Go to "Socials" and pick a blank key. Right click on it. A window will
open up with a blank title line and five or six blank lines below it. 

Give it a title of "Train" or something you'll recognize.
Go to the first line and enter /ooc Train to zone! Move it or lose it!
(or whatever you want to say. You can also use /shout instead of /ooc if
you like.
Hit "Done" and the formerly blank button will now have a label of
"Train". Left click and hold on it until the button pops up on your
cursor. Drag it over to an empty hot button slot and drop it there. Use
as required.

To get fancy you can modify the main line to say "/shout Training %t to
zone!"  The "%t" will insert the name of your current target (assuming
it's what you were fighting last before you decided to run like a bard
for the zone line.)
