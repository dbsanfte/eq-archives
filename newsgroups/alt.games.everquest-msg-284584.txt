At 400 per cast a cleric can cast quite a few of these with decent
mana regen.  And by decent I mean KEI or better and 3+ item regen,
that's it.  Throw in a bard and it's a loooong time that CH can be
cast.  So if you have 59% DPS the cleric chain should be able to hold
off The Reaper.

Of course there are issues to work out but I leave those to the raid,
not discuss them here.  I figure others understand that too.  I've
never personally been on one like that, though I have been in a 10
cleric CH rot.  Boring but hey, that's raiding I guess.  Must be why I
avoid it....
