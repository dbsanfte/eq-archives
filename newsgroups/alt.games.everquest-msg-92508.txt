1. Don't know.
2. If it is like the smithing hammer gearlock item, you put it in your
primary or secondary hand I believe.
3. I bought my hammer for 200pp. Being only 5%, I don't really notice
the difference so much at my level (183), but 5% is well worth 200pp I
would say. Every little bit helps.  :)

Anyone know if there is a jewel crafting gearlock item available?
