    Sadder yet, they were initially right I think. The ratio of idiots in
the game went steadily up.

    I'm not sure how instant gratification came into this... for me
entertainment in a computer game generally equates to challenge, and most of
the dumbing-down measures taken by sony gave me the shits.

    For a high fantasy computer game, I agree. For roleplaying I find
minimisation of rules maximises realism and believability and this makes for
some funky gaming.

    I think the first step would have to be a careful rewrite of just about
everything with attention to removing those elements that reward NON-RP
behavior. To continue the given example, if a full group of evil characters
had some sort of bonus, whereas a mixed good/evil group had negatives (eg
good cleric spends 20% extra mana healing an evil tank due to incompatible
physiology/spells).

    Sounds too controlling to me, but that's just me.

    Wouldn't we all :)

    I remember enjoying tradeskills pre-bazaar...

    Roleplaying that doesn't fit with the world mechanics is unsustainable.
If we're going to have a realistic feeling fantasy, we need a horde of
trolls to hunt woody down and kill him.

    So that solves the problem up until the point where half of any evil
group needs to be dark elves.

    Probably more sort of, griefer-hell I would guess.

    Depends on how far you want to accomodate and encourage it. IMO actual
roleplaying wont be prevalent in MMORPGs until players literally speak to
each other naturally.

    It's a problem... but there are tonnes of believability-breaking things
in EQ that would stuff roleplaying. I guess that's what you're saying.
