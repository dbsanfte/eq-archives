I'd say anarchy Online is hands down about a billion percent better
than any of those. 

I got back into it again recently and it is far more complex and cool,
especially with shadowlands. All of the memory bugs that were around
at launch are gone and it should run better than those other titles
for you.

Plus, with 220 or some possible levels, you have far more room for
growth than you do in a game like dark age of camelot. At level 62 I'm
still basically a newb character, with the levels still being pretty
fast. They are fast if you solo and crazy fast if you group.

Rather than being as campcentric as some games, you get level
appropriate gear as mission rewards. You can do appropriate missions
solo, so always have a way to upgrade gear. Some really good gear is
"camped", but you don't need it. You can see what reward you will get
for running through a mission, which is accelerated with a third party
app called "clicksaver" that searches missions until you find what you
want. Funcom is okay with using this, so its fun.

You can get into the game fast but there is always more to learn.
