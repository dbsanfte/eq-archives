We do something similar on large raids where CR is especially messy.
We camp a guild cleric in the set-up room in case we do get wiped out.
The theory is that a monk is able to FD, then drag epic-enabled cleric
corpses back to set-up room where we rez and regroup.  It becomes
slightly less slick when the safety cleric is killed by a wondering
mob.  (We generally use retired accounts for this, as it at least
enables them to get drops that would otherwise rot, and provides a
welcome home present if their owners bring them out of retirement.)
