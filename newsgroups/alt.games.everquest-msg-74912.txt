The tunnels to Dalnir are a good place to hide in warsliks although I don't
know if they are anywhere near where you are hunting.

At level 27 upwards the brutes at the end of the tunnels give great XP too
and they neve assist each other, and there are never any wandering
creatures either. And if it does go horribly wrong, the zone line to Dalnir
isn't far away.
