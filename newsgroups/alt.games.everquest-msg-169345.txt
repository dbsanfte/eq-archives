Anymore, I don't think it's so much that Lott _is_ an embarassment, as that
he _did_ something embarassing.  There is nothing in his record to suggest
that he is a racist or a segregationist.  Without anything more than the
angry attacks of the rabble to condemn him, I must accept his explanation
about the matter... that the Strom Thurmmond he knew was the older man who
had renounced his ways.

Still, for someone at that level to make that mistake reflects poorly on
their judgement.

They do so because partisanship is the natural state of politics.  People
will always gather themselves together to increase their power.
