Your level also affects the chance of fizzle quite a bit.  And there are
some spells with fizzle mods, some of these are hidden (i.e. not in the
spdat, or not successfully parsed anyway).  For example, the first of
the BST-only nukes fizzled at around the minimum rate, i.e. as if my BST
was 5 levels higher than the spell and had casting skill maxed, from the
moment my baby BST got it, despite his casting skill being very low.
