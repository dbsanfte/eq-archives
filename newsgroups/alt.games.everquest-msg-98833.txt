Damn, I thought we were the only ones who have discovered the secret to bard 
pulling in VP.  It's really, really nice now that we have a long-lasting Selos.  
I'm still looking for an instant invis item though, 3 seconds between tagging 
the dragon and invis taking is a LONG time.
Or I could just use a range item and time it with the invis pulses.   Hmmm, 
amazing how you miss the obvious in the heat of the moment and can't see HOW you 
could miss in when you review it later.

Absolutely.  Overall monks pull better than any other class.  If I could only 
have a single puller class on any raid, it would be a monk.  For certain pulls 
though, an SK seems to be better.  There are also some incredibly good players 
pulling with SKs, and bad SKs don't seem to pull much in my experience.
