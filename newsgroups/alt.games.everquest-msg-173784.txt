Yes, it certainly is.

If that's all you took away from what you've read, you
need to work on your reading comprehension.

Of course, you'll set up straw men and knock them down...

Translation:  You're pissed that we're not using our power the
way *you* want us to.  So sorry...

Then you didn't bother to read it all.  Try again.

Sorry if the truth pains you so.

There you go with those straw men again.  Let me know when
you get around to addressing a position that I actually hold,
if you can grasp it.

Oh, cool, a golden oldie...  Man, just how old is your script?

That one has always cracked me up, though -- as if the US
somehow (the implication goes) just confiscates the resources it
uses, instead of, you know, PAYING FOR THEM and causing wealth
to flow to countries that would otherwise have, say, not much
more than a buttload of crude oil that's less useful to them
than medical technology, electronics, pest-resistant crops,
gobs of currency, etc. etc.

What you don't know about economics would fill a library.


>The "Blood for oil" bumper-sticker viewpoint, as you so dismissively call

Only to morons, frankly.

Iraq has been a reliable gas pump for, well, always, what
would we have to gain (oil-wise) by rocking the boat now?

If we were as monomanically fixated on oil as you laughably
believe, we'd just look the other way when Saddam gasses
his civilians and pay him for oil with the cash and
arms he craves.

You sort of "forgot" to address that scenario when I
challenged you to.  Busted!

Like the two aren't intertwined?  What color is the sky on
your world?

Yawn.

Now you're *really* boring me.

Is that the best you've got?

Reasoned rebuttals are interesting and educational.
I wish you had some.

If you think the odds of such a quixotic goal succeeding in
the long run are likely, you're very foolish.  Thankfully, the current
US administration is brighter than you are.

Ah, right, I forgot about the evil military-industrial complex
which really runs things...

I'm sorry, you've exceeded your daily quota of liberal
buzzphrases.


>and gives a handy excuse for why the public services are in
>such a sorry state.

Dream on.  People are flooding over our borders (legally and
illegally) to enjoy the benefits of our "sorry state" public
services.  You wouldn't believe how many people come here
each year from your socialist paradises to get some
*real* medical care, for example.


>3. The price in having a US-friendly regime in Iraq (one of the countries
>that controls world oil prices) is beyond measure.

You read too many cheesy novels.  Fifty years ago the US was
naive enough to think it could midwife "friendly regimes"
and have things work out happily ever after, but we woke
up from that pipe-dream decades ago.  May you someday
catch up.


>You havent nailed me on anything so far, you havent really *said* anything

/pat on head.  Here's a cookie.  Now run along with the other
kids, I tire of you.  Strutting and sneering is a poor
substitute for having good arguments and valid examples.

Gosh, look what you forgot to do (along with ignoring
at least a dozen other significant factors and smugly
pretending that you've "explained it all").

But I repeat myself...


>OK...now tell me *exactly* why the US is attacking Iraq,

Because a) we have principles and ideals (a notion which seems
to have escaped you), and b) we're one of the few
countries with the ability to do something about it, so
like it or not we have the responsibility to do so,
no matter how much nagging we get for it from the
head-in-the-sand crowd.

"Exactly" why?  That's an easy one -- subtract
your silly "for oil" motive, add back in the
ones you discarded as "just excuses to cover the
oil motive", and voila.  It's not like we've made
any secret of our reasons.

It's easy to sneer when you're a country which couldn't
address the problem even if it by some miracle didn't sneak
to the back of the room and say, "oh no, you first, we're
still... considering the issue, maybe it'll blow over if
we just hide in this handy closet."

I know the cowboy setting is going to engender some giggles,
but you really should sit down and watch the film "High Noon".
You might find it instructive.

Here's another reading assignment for you:
   http://www.sftt.org/dwa/2003/1/8/3.html

There's an old saying:  "Lead, follow, or get the hell
out of the way."  Unfortunately, all too many people
(and countries) prefer to avoid choosing any of the
three options and instead spend their time bitching,
second-guessing, sneering, and back-seat driving.


> and not say Saudi
>or North Korea, without resorting to Mark Steyn's particular brand of
>"wisdom".

Straw men, ad hominems...  Wouldn't it be less trouble for you to
just develop an actual rebuttal?

Screw it, I've abandoned the hope that you might
be able to add anything to the conversation that I
wasn't already aware of, and swatting the usual
sloganeering gets old fast.  But I'll look you up
after Saddam falls and we *don't* grab the oil,
so I can hear your rationalization for how you
weren't "really" wrong.
