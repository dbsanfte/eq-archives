Actually, people despised them for being PKers and griefers. They did
more than just randomly PKing people, they were known for training,
corpse camping, and other such bullshit. And by PKing, I mean things
such as luring people into a sense of security then turning on them
unexpectedly rather than going for a fair fight. They weren't after a
"challenge" in their PvP, they were just out to piss people off.
