I disagree--I think it says a *lot* about the games.

I wonder how many more out there are like me--people who'd never played a 
Warcraft game (or very little), who'd never so much as looked at the WoW web 
page, pre-launch, and who'd pretty much made up their mind to never touch 
the game . . .

. . . then picked up EQ2, played and enjoyed it yet found themselves 
becoming more restless, not from any one glaring thing, but an ever-filling 
box of a variety of aggravations from across the spectrum . . .

. . . and then who finally, after becoming more and more intrigued by WoW's 
"wows", bought a copy, quickly discovered why all the "wows", and then 
cancelled their EQ2 subscription.

If there was no WoW I would still (more or less) be happily playing EQ2.

At least in my case it was the WoW *game* that grabbed me, not Blizzard's 
marketing.
