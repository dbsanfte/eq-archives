It's still quad-kiting... he's just doing it multiple times.

It's quad kiting, since due to how the game is coded, 4 mobs is the maximum
that an AE spell can hit at once.   Having the extra four there isn't really
doing all that much for him... just increasing his risk for a small reduction
of "look for mob" downtime.

I guess it's possible that bardsong doesn't have that limitation, in which
case I would be wrong, but I dont' think so.
