? Then what do you call the cleric epic? my summoned hammer of 
gimpness is better than my clicky stick as a weapon, and I 
certainly dotn go around in a hunt waving my clicky stick around, 
it stays in my bag until I need to rezz someone. I carry a weapon 
that does some actual damage when I am hunting, even if I have no 
*intention* of tanking...sometimes you just need to put the hurt 
on a mob and you happen to be the nearest person with a weapon =)
