To get the spell gem as a hotkey simple left click on the gem and hold
down until it turns into a button.  This works with almost any part of
the interface you can click on.

To say something and cast a spell a different approach is required.
/hotbutton name   
will create a new hotbutton, place it and right click it.

then you can enter commands (up to 5 or 6) i think.
to do the spell cast thing:
/g Now healing %t.
/cast 1
assuming gem slot 1 is a healing spell.
