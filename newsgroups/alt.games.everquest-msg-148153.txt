Hmmn - not exactly present day but Vietnam had a bugger of a time in modern
times and a bit more recently Cambodia lost 30% of it's population. Korea
was a bitch I've heard and it wasn't much fun being Chinese when the
Japanese were occupying either.

The African continent seems in the midst of imploding from epidemic about
right now and have also enjoyed a *lovely* recent history on the whole. The
Indian sub continent has had regular storms with more brewing.

The outlook for North Korea looks overcast with patchy rain but clearing
over East Timor. The long range forecast for Russia looks rather...well,
infectious actually. Currently the barometric readings for being female
accross a great part of the globe is exceedingly grim.

What can I say - life sucks the greater percentage of the time and if it's
not some fella from accross the world screwing you over it's your own
neighbour. Thing is that even a die hard cynic like me cannot understand how
actively pursuing a course of lesser tolerance will improve things when it
is a distinctive lack of tolerance which makes mankind such a barbaric
monster in the first place.
