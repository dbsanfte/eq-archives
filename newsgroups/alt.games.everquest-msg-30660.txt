Couldn't have said it better Lokari - once again, you have a way with words
:)

I play exclusively on the PvP servers.  Started EQ a couple of years back on
Tunare I believe and liked it but always found it weird how races that were
supposed to hate one another would be seen grouped so I went to the PvP
servers.  Just helped me play the game how I liked it and have fun.

The only thing I hate, and perhaps the dumbest thing you will ever hear in
EQ, is someone shouting across a zone '"so-and-so" is a PK!'.  Well duh -
its a PvP server.  This is usually followed by a series of pre-adolescent
posturing that fills the shout and ooc channels.  This is usually followed
by me adding them to my ignore list so I don't have to listen to them.

In all my travels on Tallon Zek, I have to admit though that the number of
people who are intent on just being assholes is rather small. Just my
experience anyway.  I'm sure others have other stories to tell.  I never
started a char on the new one ... the rules looked to me like it might
create an environment where I would go beyond a little more "edge" in the
game as I describe playing on Tallon to possible anarchy so I decided to
stay away.

I guess the only other thing that is a concern on these servers is that you
can be limited on where you travel.  I hear a lot of talk in here on zones
that I know my high elf cleric main char will likely not be able to go to.
Oh well, just makes me have to revisit the Iksar SK I have had on the shelf
for a number of months who will suffer the same problems.  But its a price
I'm willing to pay for how I describe "fun" when playing EQ .... and I try
not to do it with poorly contrived flames of the general gaming populace :)
