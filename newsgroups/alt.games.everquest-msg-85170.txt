I'm currently running 2 computers sharing a cable modem.  Both
computers have win2k.  The main computer has 2 network cards, and i
use sygate to share internet access with the secondary computer.  I
can play Everquest fine on either computer, but when I try to play on
both computers, the secondary computer always loses its connection
after a minute or two.  I've never had any other internet related
problems besides this.  Has anybody else ever had this problem and
fixed it, or does anybody have any suggestions?
