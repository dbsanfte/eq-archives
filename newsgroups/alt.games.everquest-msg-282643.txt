SWG will probably be going long after EQ and WoW have both closed down.  The
power of a powerful franchise.  I'd guess SWG took the least hit from
WoW of any games in the genre.

They're today's suddenly-6'9" highschool basketball star, with the same
tendency to trip over their own feet adjusting to their size.

Maybe in a few years they can claim the 800-lb gorilla title, but they have
to prove longevity first.  Their success is every bit as much a result of
good timing as it is being a quality game.

Makes one wonder if Sony would have preferred for WoW to come out first
seven years ago and have EQ released now.  Hard to say, they've made a
helluva lot of money over the past half a dozen years and nearly a dozen
expansions.

Who is #1 can change no doubt.  I think Blizzard has a comfortable lock on
that spot for a little while to come.  One difference between Sony and the
others is that Sony has actually been #1.  I would imagine they still have
plans to be so again.   =)

In other news, SWG2 announced for 2009 release.  No, I'm not joking.
