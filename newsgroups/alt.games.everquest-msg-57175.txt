Dragging corpses is one way. Most likely you were buffing someone while the
protectors of growth were simply alive anywhere in the zone. They have ZONE
WIDE aggro range, and can "see" any act they deem hostile (like buffing
someone who they are KOS to) from anywhere in the zone. It doesn't take
much. Dragging corpses is another good way to hose faction.

Well, you are pretty well fucked. Sorry to say.

>I cannot shop in the Druid Guild in Kelethin.

This part you can fix. There is a quest in freeport where you give muffins
to some schlep, and it raises all of the outside-of-velious factions that
hunting in PoG lowers.

No, because the WL faction is different from the faction inside the plane
itself.

>I want my goddess to love me again!

Start a new character if it means that much.

>Any ideas?

Yea, next time you see faction hits that you don't like...STOP DOING
WHATEVER IT IS YOU ARE DOING TO GET THEM. I mean really...DUH. As a Tunare
worshipping druid, it would take 6-8 hits to go KOS in the plane, did it
not occur to you after the first such message that maybe you should not be
doing what you were doing?
