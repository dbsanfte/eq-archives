I have NEVER used the "CHeal" bug/exploit intentionally in all of my
44 levels. I did recast the level buff once by mistake, because I
forgot to swap it out before engaging in combat (I use /cast 6 as my
level buff/pet heal swap spot) 

Using the CHeal bug was much to mana intensive, and the casting time
was much longer. If you healed your pet too early you would waste
mana, and if you waited to long you could lose the pet. The only
situation I can see using it in, is if you pull something that is too
tough for you, and you have to pull out all the stops to keep your pet
alive. 

Any BL that relied on CHeal'ing their warder was seriously
shortchanging themselves. They could plow through easier mobs much
faster tanking alongside their pet. It is almost trivial to keep your
warder's health, your own HPs and your mana at 50% with constant pulls
and almost zero downtime.

/agree

I have already seen several posts whining about this on
www.eqbeastlord.com 

/boggle.

This patch was a HUGE upgrade to BLs. I have no complaints.
