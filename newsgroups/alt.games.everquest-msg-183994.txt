Well, that's not what I meant to say.  A chess master has to memorize
such a huge amount of arcane knowledge that quickly and accurately
selecting from that store of knowledge is a skill he must train, but
that doesn't make his "book" knowledge a skill.  And beyond that he
must develop substantial skill at analyzing positions that his book
knowledge does not apply directly to.

I've gotten some pretty good examples from some posters, and those
like you who questioned my question have also helped.
