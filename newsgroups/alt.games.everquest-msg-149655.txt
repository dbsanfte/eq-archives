The Bazaar will fix this over time.  Pre-bazaar, buyers often had to jump at
the first thing they saw with good stats for a slot, because who knows how
long before you'd find someone else in your server's auction zone selling a
similar item?

Now that we have the Bazaar, prices on things like that BPS should come
down.  An important thing about item prices is that if two items are
basically the same, in the stats that matter, they should be priced about
the same.  THE COST TO PRODUCE THE ITEMS IS NOT A FACTOR.  I put that in
upper case because it is so important.  If the market price for a particular
set of stats is, say, 1K, and you are trying to sell an item that costs 5k
to produce, the market doesn't care.  Your competition is not just everyone
else selling that item--it is everyone selling items that give the same
stats.

Only if there are no common substitutes for that 5k item would it be worth
producing, so that you might catch a buyer who really wants those stats, and
doesn't want to wait around for the 1k items to show up.
