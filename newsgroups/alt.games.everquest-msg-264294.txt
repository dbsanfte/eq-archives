Didn't get them at 10 or 20, because I learned my lesson at 6. I 
completed the 10 and 20 quests and those dinged me to the respective 
levels. Haven't bothered with the artisan stuff as yet, but to give it 
a full fair test I guess I should. Still, I wonder why I didn't get 
level 8 as you did on the earlier part. /shrug Not a big deal in the 
long run as I imagine these chars will be wiped on going live and I 
don't intend to play EQ 2 when it goes live.
