If you guys really want I can get some nice clean logs for you.  I can
use a 16/26 1hs and a 13/26 1hb and run it for some rather long
battles and see if it works out correctly.  I should be having DW fire
304/400, or 76% of the time.  I tried going over my logs since
yesterday, but my computer is balking at my rather excessive logfile.
Maybe it's time to rotate it out and start fresh so I can actually
manually go through and pick out the combat stats.
