Well, they can.  If you're going to measure the relative power of a class,
you've got to take that into account.

Ok, so Druids can > Paladins can't.  Looks like Druids got the better end of
that bargin.  Sure, you have to be careful, but that applies anywhere, with
any class.

I've heard Druids discuss the uninhabited zones they can quadkite in.  One
of them will have to answer that, though.

Sounds better than a Paladin's lot in life.  An overpull or add can quite
easily lead to death.  A good pull can lead to ten minutes of med time.
We're worse off than you on one of your bad pulls, never mind a good quad.

Which can be done.

Again, you have the oppertunity.  It's one of the best advantages given to
druids.  The fact that some druids don't like to take advantage of it does
not entitle them to additional benefits.  I can imagine the laughter if my
paladin said "I don't like to melee, I'd rather cast, so I should get the
ability to quad kite."

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
