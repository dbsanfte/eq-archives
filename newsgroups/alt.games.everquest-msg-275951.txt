While I was still considering alchemy, I did attempt to make some potions 
and poisons, but found that it was almost impossible to make anything due 
to the rare compnent requirement, and that was part of what made me 
decide to go Sage instead.

That would be as opposed to Sages, who can make spells (quite comparable 
to the tank powers), and patterns (which anyone can now make).  Which is 
all Sages could ever make, at least alchemists had their moment.

I almost went alchemist, planned on it right until I was about to ding 
20, then switched to Sage under the misguided notion that I'd be making 
my own spells.  Well, given how much of an expense it was to actually 
raise my skill when I had to purchase the inks, or, alternatively, 
waiting on a friend to find the time to go through the extremely tedious 
process of making me a stack of ink, while another friend made me a stack 
of paper, and quills (both of which required the same alchemist friend to 
make subcomponents), it was becoming completely impossible to actually 
make any headway, and I ended up at level 22 until the recent changes.

There are only a few tradeskills that seem to have any real actual 
utility that people regularly want things from.
