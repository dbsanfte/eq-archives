You're probably better off if you just ignore Hill Giants for now and
worry about leveling. The exp is horrible there anyway, only reason to
hunt them is for the money and the higher levels are much better at
that than you at 36. Plus, that spot brings out the worst in people,
it's easier just to leave the idiots there fighting with each other. 

Depending on your race, there's decent spots to hunt at your level and
if you need cash, you'll probably be quicker just to farm things like
tailoring components.
