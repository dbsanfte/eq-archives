This is wrong.

Since the great xp change that got rid of
hybrid penalties, it's actually been beneficial
to be the low member of a group.

The reason is that experience is divided in
a linear manner:

Level_player/(Level_player+Level_groupmate1+...+Level_groupmate5)

While the XP to get to a level is based on
level CUBED.

Take your level 40 player, group him with a level 50.
Let's say they're taking on Elemental warriors in the
Hole (about level 40ish)

The 40 player gets 40/90 of the xp, or 44 (rounded) percent.
The 50 player gets 50/90 of the xp, or 56 (rounded) percent

The 40 player needs an amount of xp around (IIRC the ShowEQ
stuff correctly) (41^3-40^3)*1000 (excluding racial penalties)
to level to 41.  Or, 4,921,000

The 50 player needs (51^3-50^3)*1000 or 7,651,000

I can't remember the exact ZEM of the Hole, but it's
around 100, so that warrior is worth
ZEM*group_bonus*40^2 or
100*1.02*1600

163,200 xp.

If the 40 soloed it he'd get

163,200/4,921,000, or around
3 percent per kill.

I took a character to the Hole for a while and PL'd
him by letting my Mage pet take it to running, reclaiming
the pet and having the enchanter nuke it down.  The ele's
were blue to yellow (39 to 41 seems about correct) and
I got 2-3 percent each kill, so my numbers for xp are pretty
close.  They are probably a bit low because of the multiplier
that is incremented at all the old hell levels.

Now, in the group the 40 is getting .44 x 163,200 or 71,808.
Percent to 41 is 71,808/4,921,000 or 1.46 percent.

The 50 gets .56x163,200 or 91392.  He needs 7,651,000,
so he gets 91,392/7,651,000 or 1.2 percent.

So, as you can see, on a per kill basis the 40 is getting
a greater percentage of his level.

Add to this that he is able to participate in killing mobs
of a much greater level than he'd otherwise be able to kill,
and he is much better off in a group of higher levels.

A 40 in a full group of 50's is getting 4/29 *1.2 percent of the
xp of mobs he'd otherwise never go near.

Better yet, combine a 41 with my 61 mage and see how his xp
goes.  My 61 pet can solo things that are red to the 41, yet
all I have to do is 1 point of damage and the pet takes no
xp.  I've done this with a cleric that level in The Gray
on Sun Revs (level 55, my pet can't solo them, but can tank
them easily)  More fun (and productive for the cleric) is
the temple.  I can clear almost the entire thing.  I pull
with Burst of FLame (level 1 nuke), run it onto my pet,
and chain pull the next ones.  I almost always have 2
snakes or a snake and a golem on my pet.  No nukes (I can't
sit - the add will peel off on me, as only social aggro is
keeping it on the pet).

All the Cleric has to do is CH my pet starting at 25-30
percent health and buff the pet.  He can sit at any time,
as healing a pet carries almost no aggro.  I've had a bot
cleric sit under the feet of a sun rev after C-Healing my
pet without getting aggro.

Of course I get almost no xp for those low blue/cyan
mobs - but I was leveling a friend and we got some ok drops
for the bazaar from the nameds.

Remember, I was clearing 40-45 level 47 plus mobs an
hour.  If the ZEM in the gray is 75, the cleric was getting
around 75*1.02*47^2 * 41/102 or 67,926 xp per kill.

Given that he needs (42^3-41^3)*1000 or 5,167,000 xp
to level, he was getting around 2.5 blues per hour.

I don't know how far into 41 he was when we started,
but 4 hours later he was 2 blues into 42 - so that
number is probably in tbe ballpark.

Remember that in the 50's, it becomes even more beneficial
to be the low man - there is a bonus based on how close
the mobs level is to yours, so high blues/evens/yellows
are worth more than low blues.  So a high 50's character
grouped with low/mid 60's at say, consorts in PoN is getting
a far bigger bonus from the yellow creepers/red consorts
than his groupmates, to whom they are high blue.
