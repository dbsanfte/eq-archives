Well, we're all speculating here but there are reasons to distinguish the 
two cases you mention. As the publisher of battle.net and WoW, a lot of WoW 
players will naturally be drawn from that installed base for a variety of 
reasons (brand loyalty, just more ways to hear about it, etc), in the same 
way that the people I hear talk the *most* about EQ2 are EQ players. Much of 
the rest of the world doesn't even know about it or care much about it. I 
don't think WoW will be anything like "exclusively" bnet folks, but I think 
the bnet crowd will be the plurality, if not the majority.

As such, I think the bnet culture will have a dominant effect on the game's 
environment, for better or for worse (I get the feeling that few people 
would argue against "worse").

Agreed that the game will draw on multiple influences, but I don't think I 
can agree, for example, that the cultural norms expressed in A.G.E. will 
have equal influence with those found on battle.net. I think that's an 
overly optimistic assessment. But I hope you're right, I'd like to see WoW 
become something much better than what I experienced during my participation 
in the stress test.

Speaking of which, I haven't played since last week and I guess the accounts 
are about to expire day after tomorrow. Anyone who's still playing it see 
any significant changes recently?
