Head to T.King's ezboard site and check out his artwork at
http://pub165.ezboard.com/fmaximus94788frm10.showMessageRange?start=1&stop=20&topicID=74.topic
I can't even play EQ any longer with their default UI. This man's work
is unbelievable! Most of his art seems to have been incorporated into
UI mods by Remelio who also has a lot of extras at
http://pub165.ezboard.com/ftranscendence39908frm31
Remelio also gives simple and easy to follow instructions on
installing UI mods. Kudos to both of these guys, they've made EQ a bit
more refreshing for me.

Another nice little item I use from time to time is at
http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/timer.asp
It's an ingame timer. Once you have the timer setup all you do is move
the pointer to the timer's current position (as soon as you've killed
the mob, cast the spell, etc. or whatever you wish to time). When the
timer set up for that particular time (6 minute spawn time for example
you would make a 6 minute timer) once again reaches where you have the
pointer set, the time is up and I hope you have regained your mana :).
