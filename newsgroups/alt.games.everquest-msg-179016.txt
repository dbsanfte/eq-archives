Thank you for that very informative post... I knew that already. Not
only did I read everything I could find on Alla's, and every other fan
site I could think of / find with a search, I also spent 2 or 3 days
at a time in each of the Kunark zones that have goblin-type mobs in
them trying to find it for myself.

I had hoped someone here might remember where the damn thing is
because I do remember seeing it a few years back in my Kunark days,
just can't remember where I was.
