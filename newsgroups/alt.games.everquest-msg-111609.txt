You are not paying attention :) I said that many cultures used a curved
blade and they used it for a variety of reasons. That d&d and eq chose to
call that blade a scimitar was arbitrary and fairly stupid considering the
cultural world view druids came from.

Druids did use curved blades and straight ones too . Clerics are based on a
christian mythos and oddly enough there is a provision against drawing blood
which is why they could only use blunt objects. No such provision exists for
druids, and as a matter of fact druids where bloodthirsty bastards as far as
priest types go. Shamanic cultures also had no such provision against
drawing blood .
