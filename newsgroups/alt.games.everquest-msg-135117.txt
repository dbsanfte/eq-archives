When my druid got to 30th I trained both Specialied Evoke and Specialized
Conjuration. I did that to see which would hit 50 first, and that skillwould
be the one that I would let get to 50+, and then train the others. Well, as
I expected Evoke hit 50 first, but then it simply quit advancing, no matter
how much I use the skill. Ive even tried "buying" the 51st skill point at
the trainer, but that wouldnt work either. Is there somthign special that I
have to do to get Specialized Evoke to hit 51 so I can go ahead and train
the other specialized skills ?

Any help is appreciated!!
