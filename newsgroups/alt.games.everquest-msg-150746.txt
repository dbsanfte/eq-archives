I can agree to some extent that wizards have long been a broken class.

- I.e. the Al'Kabor spells could hit AE to unlimited number of mobs until
nerfed, now it only hits 5 mobs max, but the MANA was never lowered, so the
whole spell line is a complete waste and has been for years now!

- According to some research and parse logs (from Graffe), wizards have one
of the lowest DPS (of all the offensive classes!!!).

- It has always been tough to get in groups as a wizard. It has also been a
major pain to solo without gear, since we don't have enough mana or high
enough dmg/mana to take on blues. So you must rely abit on being twinked.

- When you hear about "quadding wizzies/druids" and think OH WOW... don't! A
necro was on his 5th MOB whilst the wizards&druids where medding after
killing 4. So as you see... a necro outdamages and can sustain damage and
pulls alot faster and longer than wizzies&druids ever can.
