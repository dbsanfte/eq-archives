This is going to be the ultimate in "newbie" questions.  I have been playing
EQ for almost a month.  When I started, it was suggested that I go to a
server that was in green.  I played there for a few days, and learned quite
a bit.  Then I was told I should be on a server that had (Newbie) in the
title so I did that.  Once again I played a few days and learned more.  The
person that got me involved in EQ told me they were on The Nameless server
and that I should be there if were were ever going to play together.  I like
The Nameless server.  Everyone has been very helpful there, and that is
where I stay now.

Here are the questions:
When I get a bill from EQ/Sony, will it be for one (1) account or will it be
for three (3)?  different servers
I have multiple characters on Nameless.  Will I be billed for one (1) or
forfive (5)?  different characters

TIA for this info.  I just don't want a big suprise headed my way.
