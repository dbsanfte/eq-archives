But even if that applies you have to prove that the felony or misdemeanor 
took place.  You would have to show that the guy was stealing the food in 
question, rather than simply being mistaken.  (What do you think he's going 
to say?)

If I'm your coworker and I bring a Healthy Choice or Smart Ones or 
Stouffer's box meal to work and toss it in the fridge, and your tampered 
meal is made by the same company, so our boxes look similar, if I eat your 
meal by accident, thinking it's mine, and have to go to the hospital or even 
die because of the tampering, you've committed a crime.

And even so, in some localities even if I did have bad motive and was 
stealing your lunch, that doesn't necessarily let you off the hook. 
Intentionally poisoning someone's a felony, and in some jurisdictions,  your 
act isn't mitigated by my own bad acts.  Yes, I could get prosecuted for 
stealing your food, but that isn't going to keep you from being prosecuted 
yourself for poisoning me.

And if by poisoning me, it means you've given me something I'm allergic to 
that you may not have had knowledge of, that's not necessarily going to save 
you.
