If you feel that I have been making personal attacks then I hope the day
never comes when I feel the need for a personal attack.  I really don't
think you'd enjoy finding out what a personal attack from me is like.

Your campaign to free idiots from their oppressors is duly noted, just
not considered a very good idea.  It is not your post I considered an
attempt at attention, but anyone, yourself included, who desires a
stupid name.  You are campagning on behalf of Buttcrack and Imaho
afterall, you can't expect to not be associated with them while doing
so.  Don't take it personally, its not you I object to, its your
expressed views.

Again you seem to not be catching my drift.  If you want a silly name,
go play games with rules that allow silly names.  If you want to
roleplay there is absolutely nothing about the naming rules to prevent
you from doing so... unless you wanted to roleplay a drooling idiot with
a stupid name of course.  Roleplay however you feel your character
should, just don't call him Humpurazz.  Changing EQ into a world full of
even more stupid named chars is NOT something you should be proud of if
you succeed.

th
previous posts left for reference in case others are as confused by your
reactions as I am, though I have seen the tactic used before.
