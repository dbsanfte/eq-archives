Yeah - I got too many resists on banishment when I tried -
felt like we did worse.  One time we were on the last mob
and I didn't have that last bit of mana - And I realized 
only after that I had 500 mana a right-click away (my
air pet was buffed to 5k hp, so a reclaim would have netted
me 500mana) enough for a FoT.  You can believe I felt like
a shmuck when I realized that.
