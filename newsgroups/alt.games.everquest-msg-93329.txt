Sort of soloed him with 45 druid. Muhahaha. Fear my ES arms and Warden
Symbol of Tunare.
After he gated some warrior wandered back to his chamber and killed all the
extras for me from the second pull (plus some idiot adherent that had been
bothering me from the beginning)

He likes to cast, he does gate, and his friends will attack you even if they
are green.

His friends will agro you, however they will not be social with the
Chancellor if you are high enough level.  (another example of this is shadow
beasts on floor 1 of ToFS, a level 50 can single pull them right through
another one just fine with a spell or arrow, but if they walk into the room,
all of the beasts go hihihi)

And I was fortunate that I think some newbie had just died to him or
something because he was at the front of the room, and had no pet.  Adviser
Sh'orok was up but didn't come with him on either pull (initial and after
gate), and Weaponsmith Ko'zirr and the imperial escourts are in a completely
different area of the fort.

For druids, buff up, for me I had see invis (thanks bracer of hidden), wolf
form, Spikecoat, Skin like Diamond and Chloroplast on.  Had to recast Chloro
about halfway through, it is necessary in order to suck up the Chancy's
nukes.

Resists are also extremely useful, in all 5 categorys, mine were 25 poison
(he landed something on me with the dripping dagger icon 100% of the time),
78 magic (I think I had resist magic on myself too), 22 disease (he landed
scourge all but one time so keep expulse disease memmed), 90 cold and 90
fire.

Close fight, I could've soloed him fine if he didn't gate (or I saw him
casting gate, and had a stun loaded), I couldn't have killed him if the
warrior hadn't wandered back to kill the wanderers and beat the gate out of
him.
