Three options:
1) Free - borrow an EQ disk from a local friend.  The registration (assuming
you registered) is stored on the server and you don't need YOUR original
disk.

2) Pretty cheap, but time consuming.  Contact Verant...maybe they'll send
you out another one.

3) Buy the Trilogy for around $30(?) and glory in the fact that you finally
have every expansion and GUI enhancement. :)

errr, or 4, I guess...you can probably download it using the patcher but
that's going to take a while, even at cable speed, and it doesn't help any
if you have to reinstall EQ on some computer in the future.
