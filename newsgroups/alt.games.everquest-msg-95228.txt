 Correct.

 It opens the door rather than transports you like TOFS. One key is
enough. Rogue can pick all the locked doors.

 If you bring a rogue you can start with North, West or South. The
(first) North key drops from the sperm thing. I forgot what it was. A
candle thing. The second key to get to the end of the wing is a ground
spawn. Check the map on eqmaps.com. I think it had key spawn locations
shown but I can't remember. Basically it's in the middle room.

 Usually to get to the locked door at the end of the wing the key will
be a ground spawn. The ones for the zone-in room doors are mob drops.

 Eh. Check Safehouse maybe. It may have been marked on one of the maps
as well. I haven't been there in awhle so I forgot what they all are.

 The end of North and West bring you back to the zone-in room. South and
East put you outside by the temple ramp.

 Not really. Once you 'drop' from a ledge it's basically one-way. You
need to either fight your way to the end, gate out, or drop down to the
basement and fight back to the pad thing that pops you back at zone-in.

 See above.  Zone in. Yes there are mobs down there. East steps in zone
in room are a trap and will drop you down. You can gflux over there but
some GMs would probably consider that an exploit rather than resourceful
tactics.
