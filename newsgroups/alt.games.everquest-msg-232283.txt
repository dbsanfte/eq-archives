Heh, but the backspace key kicks the @#$%! out of liquid paper. :)  
I think I was actually taking a high school typing class in 1984.  And 
then I'd go home and print all my essays out on the noisy-ass daisywheel 
printer.  Soooo much more readable than dot matrix, though. :)

}Yeah, I rememberd the date right. 1984! NINETEEN FREAKING 84!!!
}God, I was young then. I picked it up in paperback a couple years
}after that. I thought it was one of the best books I've ever read. 
}Anyone who hasn't read it should pick it up, its just amazing what he

}things about growing general use tissues which are not rejected and
}such (research being done now with stem cells and making tissues
}"neutral".)

The part I thought was interesting is that he apparently didn't know a 
whole lot about computers at the time.  I could see how that might really 
free your imagination to look at things that might be possible that people 
who actually -use- computers would have thought was ridiculous.

I don't think I read it until about 1992 or so.  It's still a damn god 
book, though. :)
