As an  SK, I spend a little time oocing group looking for more

But thats

/ooc group looking for more, have tank, DPS *, healer, room for 5.

Meanwhile, said group is already pounding on stuff, and will continue to 
do so no matter which classes show up to join in.  Half the fun of EQ is 
finding ways to make odd combinations of classes work out, the people 
who play strictly warrior cleric chanter DPS DPS DPS groups are missing 
out on the challenge.

Berg, 60 SK

*And yes, I know that part about being DPS is a joke, although in my 
defense I'm referring to my pet, who does more DPS than I do, at least.
