The Exp may indeed suck compared to PoP zones, but to be truthfull, I dont
think that a 49 Cleric, and 51 warrior duo could safely do anyhting that I
am aware of in PoP. And you cant say that the exp sucks in Nadox. At 1% of
level per kill for both of us, Ill not complain at all.

On the other hand, if you know a place where a group consisting of a 51
Warr, a 49 cleric, and possibly a 56 Druid ( dual boxed by me along with the
Warr ) could hunt successfully then Id sure like to know it :)
