One other thing to do besides watching where the mob is facing is to
pay attention to your group's spell casting.  For example, if the
Shaman announces that he is slowing the mob, that should be a warning
that the Shaman has begun casting the spell and is about to piss it
off.

No need to assist a second time to get back on the mob.  Assist once if
you feel you need to check, then hit tab (or whatever you have it bound
to) to switch to your previous target.
