Druids and shamans arnt meant to be damage machines. They perform support
roles in groups, like clerics and enchanters.

As for mages and necromancers (a caster you didnt mention), im not sure you
would outdamage them. Youd need a couple of very nice weapons.

As for wizards, for most groups Id prefer a rogue, monk, necro, mage for
most situations, just for doing the damage.
