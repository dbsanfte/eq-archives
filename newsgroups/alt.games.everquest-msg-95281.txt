  Firiona Vie in some ways is a testbed, Verant said as much at the server's
release.  The rules don't necessarily improve the climate for roleplay... though
there are some sound arguments that say that they do.  TLC is intended to be an
anti-camping/farming rule... instead of going it alone and farming green mobs
for the loot you want, you're encouraged to get together a group to get the
things you want directly.  The "bind only in town" rule for casters is intended
to have the same effect that it was originally intended to have for melees... to
make the cities and other spots a meeting place... jumping off spots for
adventures.  It's debatable about whether or not it's effective, but on an
underpopulated server, anything that helps bring people together is welcome.

  Of course, just because you can get people together doesn't mean they're
roleplay... but you can't roleplay with somebody you can't meet... and being
face to face with a person is more conducive to RPing than long distance /tell
conversations.

  All the rules though, good or bad, are part of what gives FV its unique
character and part of what makes it special and enjoyable.  Some of the rules I
love (one character only rule), some of them I could do without (mandatory
/roleplay... I think it's non-conducive to roleplay to have to begin your
conversation with a person with an OOC inquiry to figure out if you can group
with them) but I like the net result.
