I thought questions had question marks? 

I don't think you deserve it, but here's one anyway.

The DMCA was used against 2600 for printing the DeCSS DVD decoder source 
code. This code was written solely for the purpose of playing DVDs in 
Linux. No DVD company would or had put out a workable Linux DVD player, so 
the community made its own. This code is now illegal.

The DMCA also allows copy protection to be installed on CDs and other 
media, which directly interferes with fair use under the US Code and 
international copyright law.

Before you get all snotty and arrogant here, try to remember that *you* are 
the lazy git that can't even be bothered for a simple google search.
