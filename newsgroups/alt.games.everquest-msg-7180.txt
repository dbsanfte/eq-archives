I gave up trying to keep track of all his bullshit...it got tiresome
pointing them all out to people. It's hard to believe that someone can weave
so many different stories, over such a short period of time, that all
conflict with each other and expect to get away with it. I guess he thinks
that the internet is a safe haven and that every NG is it's own world that
doesn't communicate with any other worlds. Don't worry all...WWIIonline will
be up and running soon enough and you'll most likely never have to hear from
him again.
