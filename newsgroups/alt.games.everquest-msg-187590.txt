Though I believe you'll find that WinXP was designed to replace the 9x
home line, and that Win2k was the replacement for the NT office line.
It does help a great deal that they're both based on Windows NT
though, in my experience it's made them both incredibly stable,
however I've always preferred Win2k because it's less of a memory hog
than XP can be, and also seems to keep better control over it's
programs.
