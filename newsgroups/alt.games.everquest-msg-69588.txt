The standard to which MOST companies program is I586, not Intel...
there is a slight difference, but a difference just the same.

And, in contradiction to the common falacy that people with AMD
processors have more problems than Intel users do, balls.  The issue
is NOT the CPU, but more often than not, the motherboard or chipset
manufacturer.  And those issues are more often than not conflicts with
hardware than anything...  issues which affect DYI people with Pentium
chips as much as they do AMD users.  

Of course, everyone calls Microsoft the standard for OS's, and
Creative Labs the standard for audio, but how many times in this very
forum have we seen issues with W2K and SBLive cards?
