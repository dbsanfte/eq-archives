Being a banker I can answer that question.  If someone gets the number it's
not at all carefree.  There's very little recourse, compared to credit
cards, for bogus charges on a debit card.  AND if you fall below a zero
balance on your debit card there's a very good chance you're going to be
charged a minimum of $20-$25 if your account is at a bank (as opposed to a
credit union, many of which do not charge for negative balances).

Credit cards are a much better idea.  If you're screwed you have recourse.
At worst it's only an inconvenience.  Bogus credit card stuff can be 100%
fixed.
