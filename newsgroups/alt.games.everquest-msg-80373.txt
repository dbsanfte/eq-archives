OK, do you mean that the armor dropped in Kael is better than Hate or that
to raid in Kael to build up faction to get the ToV armor you'll need the
faction boost from killing giants in Kael will get you?

Just as I'm sure all the clerics prefer higher tanks.  Now how common are
clerics at this level?  Still enough to have one per each group in a raid?

At 53, right?  What level would clerics expect to do North wing raids?

What's the URL of The Safehouse?  I checked and it isn't www.safehouse.com
