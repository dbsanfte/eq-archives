Yeah, there have been a lot of annoying beggars in the Bazaar on Starpyre
lately.  However, I'm not sure they are newbies.  I think most of them are
players starting up on a new server but not having the patience to earn
their money like everyone else.  I think most REAL newbies haven't learned
to be that abrasive yet and tend to try killing critters instead of begging
for plat.  I often help what I think are real newbies and quite often give
them a nice gift or two to help them on their way.  But I *NEVER* give to
the annoying beggars who stand outside the banks moaning 'Can you spare 10
plat for the new weapon I need?'  And I come back an hour later and the same
beggar is asking 'Can you spare 10 plat for this armor upgrade I need?'
Freakin' freeloaders!  No offense to you beggars...ah, what the hell, go
ahead and be offended, I don't care!  :)
