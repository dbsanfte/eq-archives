Taking away the effort required to build a character and actively
encouraging "baby hueys" in the game. Sounds pretty obvious to me as
something that would decrease the overall quality of the game. Of
course a lot of the pre-levelled characters would be purchased by
experienced players. That may or may not work out well enough.

Of course there are. However, it's a bannable offense. It would affect
my enjoyment of the game to wind up in a group with a 50+ rogue who
had never heard of Evade.

Yes, granted, my objection at that point would be purely based on my
feeling that it is unnecessary and they are just selling out. I,
myself, really have no interest in buying a character to begin with.
By the same token I really have no interest in grouping with someone
whose attention span and dedication to learning a class is too short
to level a character to 20.

As I said, they don't want anything to occur that "cheapens the game."
In my opinion, this would be a big one.

I'm sure there is quite a bit of that. I don't subscribe to that
opinion though. One example I can think of is the Sims Online. I'm not
a fan of that game, but I have considered trying it (is it even out
yet?). I can tell you that I would definitely *not* even give it a
chance if you could buy a Bill Gates-like or Michael Jordan-like
character. What's the fun in that?

I'll close by saying that I know there are examples where it would
work out fine - a player who played a very similar class to high
levels - someone who played the same class, maybe a different race to
higher levels - someone who is just very experienced with most classes
and wouldn't have too much trouble picking up a new one or just wants
to re-roll the stats on their existing character. That's all well and
good. I just doubt the majority of the customers would fall into these
categories.
