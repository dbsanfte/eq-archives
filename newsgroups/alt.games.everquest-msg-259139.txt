I realize you may be in the market for an upgrade, or it may have fried, 
but Geforce form factor fans are commonly available. Also, you may check 
with the original manufacturer. I was pleased to find out when the fan 
died on my Radeon (which was oddball) that the thing actually had a 5 
year warranty. I never realized ATI did that long. (I contacted them 
about a source for fans and they told me the card had to be under 
warranty, it was less than 5 years old.)
