I haven't used the system, but the Everquest/Luclin gamer for whom it was
built tells me that she can play it with "all options turned on" (whatever
that means) and everything works. Based upon what I've read in the Everquest
newsgroups, that's quite a feat.

CompUSA now has a 500w power supply (no case, just the p/s) for $79.

I bought the memory from PSM Trading Corporation:

http://www.psmtrading.com/

They were at a computer show in Yonkers, NY this past weekend. It bought it
at the snow. They had only two sticks left. I've done business with PSM
previously and have not had a problem.

I've bought most of my memory lately from:

http://www.18004memory.com

They were at the Yonkers show, but had only 256MB modules available, so I
couldn't buy from them.

Hope this helps.
