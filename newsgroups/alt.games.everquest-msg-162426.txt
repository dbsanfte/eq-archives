I have to disagree on this.

I've played my bard to 48 now with CHA being at about 104, and my charms last
quite a long time as it is.  On occasion I get a shorter one, but it's maybe 1 in 9 or so...
and it's easy to cope with.. just re-charm!  Verant has stated in the past that CHA only
play a very small role in the charm and mez calculation.  So, I'd put more emphasis
on DEX (which affects the missed note calculation) and AC, so that if you ever
do cut it too close during kiting you won't take so much damage from the mobs.

Now, that said, SOE stated recently that CHA will have an effect on the Lull song
(Kelin's Lugubrious Lament) if and only if it fails.  The higher your charisma,
the greater the likelyhood that the mob will not aggro upon failure of the song to stick.

So if you're lulling to do single pulls, high CHA is a consideration.
