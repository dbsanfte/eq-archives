Anyone know if ICM or Callwave work when EverQuest is running?  ICM and
Callwave are programs that allow you to recieve phone calls on the internet.
Due to the nature of EverQuest (Its process in windows), I've heard that
this can't be done because EverQuest won't let you get to windows without
exiting.  I think Verant should work on  the client so you can recieve these
phone calls.  Maybe work with Callwave or ICM to allow for EverQuest users
to receive the phone calls.
