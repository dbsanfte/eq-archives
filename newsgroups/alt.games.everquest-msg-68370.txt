  Then why was there not an "open test" of the new DX8.1 engine that
was released on December 4th?  Verant has an incredible pool of
testers at their disposal... the thousands of us willing to download
their beta software and try it out on the Test server.  If they aren't
going to use us for all we're worth, what is the point?

  If they were absolutely determined to make the DX8 engine coincide
with the release of Luclin, they ought to have waited until they had
produced a version of the DX8 engine which their Test server
playerbase "okayed" as being generally bug free before releasing
Luclin and released that to us, because you know that whatever your
testers experience, your normal playerbase will experience times one
hundred.  Instead the engine that was foisted upon us could not have
been tested more than a day in their "limited test suite".

  Luclin bugs are a little more permissible because they wanted to
keep a "shroud of secrecy" around Luclin itself, so they could only
employ a limited number of beta testers.  However, the fact that
several features that were advertised as being a part of the Luclin
expansion (bazaar zone, new UI) were absent upon release, plus the
presence of some fairly severe bugs (like memory leaks), indicates to
me that they did indeed rush this product to market.  And it isn't
just the "early adopters" of Luclin who suffered from it, because as
previously mentioned, the DX8 engine that all of us are being forced
to use had to go live by the time Luclin was released.

  In my opinion, Verant has produced no worthy reason or excuse to
justify the magnitude of the problems surrounding the Luclin release.
Most of the problems with the DX8 engine at least, could have been set
straight if they had just been willing to wait longer to make it
mandatory for use.  They decided that getting Luclin on store shelves
soon was more important.
