    Well they removed the hybrid penalty in grouping situations (im told
hybrid penalty still applies but exp when grouping is modified up to
compensate so the group doesn't notice). Then, pallys and sk's lost some of
their tanking multipenalty vs warriors, THEN came the monk nerf which fixed
the utter bullshit whereby monks were better or as-good tanks as the 2
plate-wearing knight classes. Others have mentioned new spells, but a REALLY
recent change was when their yaulp line got its mana cost reduced - this is
a self haste and buff and has made soloing with a pally just that little bit
more viable. Furthermore their magic would've been less useful for a group
pre KEI because pallies don't get to med much if you're chain pulling.

    So pallies have gone from something undesirable for a group with next to
useless healing abilities that drain from a slow to regen mana pool, with
mediocre tanking abilities, to the equal 2nd best tank in the game with
decent healing abilities (check out the new LoY heal its pretty cool),
vastly improved mana regen in busy groups, and a significantly improved
soloing DPS. More DPS, better healing, KEI and better tanking have made them
a viable solo class. I have a pally friend who does as well or better solo
than my SK even though I can fear kite and he can't - he's been consistently
1-2 levels higher than me with considerably better equipment, however.

    So yeah, I'd say pallies have been de-nerfed consistently since you last
checked, spawning more interest in the class.

James
