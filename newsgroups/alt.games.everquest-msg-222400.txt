A lot of people miss the point that having 3 mobs in the camp vert
rarely means that the group is taking 3 times the damage. Couple of
reasons for that:
- root parking works on most mobs
- the classes doing the damage aren't the ones doing the off-tanking
- you can switch out the chanter for a DPS class

Take a look at a well balanced LDoN group; cleric, shaman, SK,
paladin, mage, bst. SK is main tank since he's the puller (and can
bail out with FD if he gets a pull bigger than 4), paladin offtanks
the first add, shaman offtanks the second add. BST offtanks if you get
4. On a double pull, the group isn't loosing any DPS on the main mob
since the paladin's DPS is insignificant in the overall scheme of
things. On a 3 pull, the group still isn't loosing any DPS since the
shaman can use a DoT or two. Even on a 4 pull, as long as the mage is
smart enough to assist the off-tanking BST and go into burn mode, it
quickly turns into a 3 pull. I've found that in any fairly balanced
group, it works out about the same. Mainly because in LDoN anyone but
a druid, enchanter, wizard or cleric can offtank well enough. Cleric
could offtank, but if there's a couple of mobs in camp I'd rather not
have the main healer have to worry about channeling heals. . 

You don't waste time breaking mez, you don't waste mana keeping the
enchanter alive on the mobs that resisted 2 mez, and (most
importantly) I find it a lot more fun <g>.
