I really need to remember to save a few velium weapons (same stats and
merchant value as Fine Steel but magic and has a "proc") to sell cheaply to
folks in lowbie zones.

Runed Totem Staff is the cheapest I can think of (about 15-20p?) but it's
2hb and I personally hate 2hb.

Combine weapons, sold in gypsy camps, are around 50p.  Same stats as fine
steel but magic.  This may be the easiest route unless you have some level
30+ friends that can loot a velium one (it's not like they're rare!).
