How do you know?  You dont know where it will crash.  Nor do you know what
the pilot is doing to avoid the tragedy (undoubtedly it will crash).  Nor do
you know where the debris is going to land...maybe it lands on that school
bus carrying children (OUR children) home from a school that has been
evacuated because of earlier attacks.

I am merely playing Devil's advocate here:  If the country is wiped off the
map killing millions of people.  Are not the millions of lives worth the
thousands or hundreds of thousands or maybe even millions that may be saved
due to the erradication of the people responsible for todays attacks?  You
have no real way to quantify the lives saved due to the terrorist groups
that *may* be averted if they know we will erradicate them to the extreme.

You seem to be arguing that an I for an eye is not the way to approach this
situation, yet by my understanding of what you have said...some lives are
worth more than others or at the very least equal.  I say every life is
worth what it gives back to those around it.  To me the people in the
countries that harbor these people, ESPECIALLY if the government supports
it, are worth very little.  The exception to this are those that are
actively trying to change their government.  Those people are worth a
relative TON and would (as many do) give their lives to change that
government.
