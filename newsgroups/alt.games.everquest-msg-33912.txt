If you use windows2000 you should be able to do it also

1) Alt Tab, Windows Key out of EQ
2) Cntrl Alt Delete
3) Pick 'Task Manager'
4) Right click Everquest.Exe
5) Choose 'Maximize'

There can be some video 'twitches'... and sometimes it EQ thinks you have
Cntrl, Shift or Alt pressed... simplist sulution IMO is the press cntrl,
alt, shift, then F10 to cycle through views till ya get back to one you
want...

Do tell if this don't work or you have problems... I've been through a
couple Cards on my computer (From onboard graphics on compaq, to ATI on
compaq, now have AMD Athlon System) and this shouldn't be a Card issue...
this is purely Windows 2000... Is the main reason I like Win2K heh
