Treat the symptoms - or the cause? Dan's advice was really spot on about the
winmodem. EQ is going to to bog down the best system out there, it's
"fatware" to the extreme so you want to do as much as possible to insulate
your net connection from your system load.

Ideally if your going to use an analogue modem - you want it to be external
on a serial connection, not USB even. What keeps serial modems "honest" is
the limited bandwidth between the modem and the system, the modem just
doesn't have enough throughput to the system to shunt off workload to the
CPU. As soon as you increase the availiable throughput to the system by
using a different bus (USB, PCI) then the modem manafacturers can start
literally "leaving bits of of hardware out" and emulating there function in
software. That means more load for your CPU.

Similar deal with cable/ISDN modems. Whenever your given a choice specify an
external device to an internal. There is a reason internal devices are
cheaper and it's not just plastic case and power supply...

Speaking of which - if you are using internal devices (of whatever ilk) keep
an eye on your power supply if you have been on the upgrade path for a
while. I have seen quite a few people who have upgraded motherboards, CPU's,
Memory and thrown in power hungary 3D cards without keeping an eye on the
specifications of the powersupply. Under servere load (a late model graphic
card can use a lot of power, and us EQ'ers tend to have a *lot* of ram in
our systems) the different output voltages can be erratic and this may
affect certain devices more than others depending on what voltage o/p they
use. Overall however - power problems are very rare compared to the much
more common internal Vs external issues.
