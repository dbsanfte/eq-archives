My mom spent upwards of 4-5 hours a day training - no dressage though:
her half-arab jumper was an amazing athelete, but had the roughest gait
you've ever seen.  I can't remember the technical term, but the section
of her leg right above the hoof (fetlock?  man, it's been 19 years since
I've been around horses) was very short, and resulted in a painfully
jarring trot.  On the other hand, she was so powerful that I don't think
she truly even noticed my mom's weight :)
