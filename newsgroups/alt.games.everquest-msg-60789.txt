Well, I upgraded to Win XP, and now my Soundblaster PCI 64 doesnt work very
well at all with EQ (stuttering music), so I'd use the new hardware option.


sigh, my Soundblaster PCI64 doesn't work, my Matrox G400 may not cut it for
Luclin, and I've only got 256Mb RAM.   spend more time working out hardware
issues than playing EQ nowdays!
