It's rather easy to find.   From zone in, click in the general direction of
the castle while inside PoM.   You will probably get the response "that item
is too far away to use."  Keep clicking as you move forward, and as long as
you're getting that response, you know you're moving in the right direction.
Adjust your heading as necessary to keep getting that response.   Pretty
soon you'll locate the correct tree and zone out.
