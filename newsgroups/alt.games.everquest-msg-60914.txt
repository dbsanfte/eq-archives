I have more plat than I've had at any time since level 40, I have
exactly 9000pp in the bank.  Really nothing I want can be puchased for
that other than 1.75 tinkerers bags.  Nothing I want can really be
purchased for less than 30-40kpp, and I just don't have the time,
temperment, or inclination to spend weeks sitting in EC auctioning off
stuff.

Well, my guild is nowhere near as powerful as Demogorth's.  We're a
very good 2nd tier guild, i.e. we're starting to do NToV named, but
have realized that Dragonbane is absolutely required, so we're working
on getting wizards equiped and just farming ToV drops from gimp mobs.

Why would you bitch?  I just don't understand that part.  If you are
getting an upgrade, you most likely aren't going to continue to use
the old gear, and I personally would rather be out looking for more
dropped gear.  I have a total of three pieces of gear that I didn't
get through my guild, and that includes all my BD gear, my situational
gear, my weapons, my instruments, everything.  Not that I didn't earn
it by going on the hunts and busting ass, and volunteering to take the
Death Touches and everything else, but still all but one earring, one
bracer, and my neck have come from my guild.  Not only that, most of
my gear has been upgraded several times since I joined the guild.   I
joined in Lambent with some mid-level weapons, almost 10 levels ago,
and finally got rid of the last bits of lambent in my bank by selling
3 pieces for 250pp just last week.  I've donated close to 10kpp to the
guildbank, every diamond and blue diamond I've ever won, and literally
dozens of questgems, and still think I get a lot more out than I put
in.

I think once you've been in your guild a while, and have upgraded your
gear a bit, you'll be thinking differently, but I guess it really
depends on your guild.  My guild is a raiding guild, and that means we
raid probably 5 days a week, and therefore get a lot of drops.  We had
to set aside exp days for a while and make it a guild rule that no
more than one guild group in a zone because we just turned exp days
into impromptu raids.  We do toss great gear on twinks, but when we
were 50ish, that gear was a huge upgrade to someone in the guild.  Any
gear earned on guild raids was expected to be given back to the guild,
and it's just easier to donate all gear back.  When I got my heavy
dragonwing shoulders, there were a huge upgrade to the adamanite ones
I was wearing.  The next couple of upgrades came so fast that I was
able to hand down peerless dragonwing before I could find a main that
would use the heavy ones.  They're going to a twink now.  Six months
ago it would have made me sick to see them on a twink.  We post what
we have to give on our internal boards, they're free to mains,
available at seriously reduced cost to twinks, and end up being sold
outside the guild if nobody is interested.  
The thing is that there really isn't any reason to need plat.  Any
weapons or armor I want will be earned on a guild raid, except for
something like an rune-branded girdle, and I don't think any single
item is worth 25kpp.  I guess I could buy my white scale, but we're
dropping Gore now, so Phinny's spine is actually the stumbling block
on my epic.  I do lust after the Mask of Tinkering, but don't expect
to ever see one for sale.  Recently several very rare spells came up
for sale.  We had guildies who needed those spells, had been looking
for them for a long time, and really deserved them, so within a couple
hours the guild had gathered 50kpp and an equal amount of trade items
to buy them.

I think you're on the bubble.  Once you start to upgrade your gear,
and realize that the only reason you have this new gear is because of
your guild, you'll have no problem passing on gear.  I think you'll
find that the next level is one you pass through very quickly.
