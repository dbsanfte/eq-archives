Hello EQ World,

Well after this morning's patch, my trader inventory interface is
screwed up.
I have 70 items for sale, yet only 38 are viewable by myself or other
players browsing my wares.  Also, the last two items in the item icon
column have their graphics screwed up; the graphics for the items are
just displayed with partial images, only 10 percent of the full object
image is displayed.

I can still sell, but only 38 items ... is this a bug or just a way
for Sony to force us to buy the new Froglok expansion later this
month?

Thanks for replies :)
