both excellent points

my de sk has both (as well as the cracked darkwood shield) and i love em to
death......... I keep both skills maxed out and up to now its a flavor of
the week thing

I use the Wurmy in wide open areas mostly where I have room to cast, the
MoSS works well in the tight spots like dungeons where I want to keep max
pressure on the mobs

if you have stamina anywhere below 100, go with MoSS

otherwise get your Wurmslayer
