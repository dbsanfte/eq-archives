No, you would be a jackass if you had come back at this point and told
everyone they were wrong, and you were right, that skill increases only
occur on successes.  Being wrong, and being willing to admit it when
corrected, shows that at least in this instance, you were not being a
jackass.

That being said, my experience has definitely been that skill increases are
completely unrelated to successful combines.

Smithing-175, Baking-135, Brewing-135, Pottery-128, Alchemy-90ish,
Tailoring-53 with Graeme
Fletching-80ish with Ganwein.

So I believe I do have some clue as to what I am talking about regarding
tradeskills.
