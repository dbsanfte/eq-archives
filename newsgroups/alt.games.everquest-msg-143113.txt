Why create an alt?

For myself, an integral part of EQ is meeting new folks,
grouping with them, getting to know them ... and maybe
even trusting them with a few PP to head off and buy a
spell for me.

That's not cheating - it's simply a new experience! Trusting
someone you don't know all that well, but being prepared to
trust them simply based on what you've learn about them so
far. Yup, part of the whole experience!
