Says who? Remember I -didn't- agree to those terms.

So then packet sniffing is allowed. Period. 
Your argument is that reverse engineering isn't allowed.

That wouldn't be too bright. Given that you have to have EQ to play his 
game he could argue that he's actually boosting sales of the product.

For the sake of argument, lets say they are doing just that. What then? 

Well.. the EULA, as most contracts do, stipulate what actions and 
remedies will be taken should you violate terms of the contract. In this 
case: SOE will discontinue your service. (ie ban you).

Given that these players aren't playing on the EQ server, they may be 
quite comfortable with the remedy. So SOE can ban them and be done with 
it. The EULA has been fully satisfied. SOE will have excersized its 
right to ban you for EULA violation, and the player will continue 
playing on a remote server. All parties are happy now. Right?

If not, why not? :)

Correct. (Except in the case of the DMCA in America.)

Incorrect.

Think about it. 

I can take apart a patented blender see how it works, walk over to radio 
shack and buy a motor and some blades etc and make a blender of my own. 
That is neither illegal nor does it require permission or payments -- 
unless I try to commercialize it. But I can do it in my own basement all 
I please.

Similiarly I can take a copy of lord of the rings, type it up on my 
computer, change the fonts, change everyones name to someone I know, add 
cute illustrations and print it out. This also legal and can be done 
without permission or payments. I cannot however 
distribute/broadcast/etc because that would violate copyright law.

When you buy something you are granted the right to do whatever you want 
with it, with specific limitations which are covered by patent and 
copyright laws. Contrary to what you seem to think the IP holder 
doesn't, within IP law, have the power to dictate exactly what you can 
and cannot do with something he sells you that incorporates his IP.

His only recourse is contracts if he wants to further restrict what you 
can do with the product. But contracts are not law, they aren't even 
legally binding when they haven't been signed.

Well DUH! Bringing up reverse engineering in the FIRST place was a red 
herring. I'm only explaining WHY.

Funny thing about contracts: If you refuse to sign them they don't 
actually apply. 

You see, if I write up a contract and it says: By signing this contract 
you agree to fill my truck full of the gold nuggets that I just sold 
you. By refusing to sign this contract you agree not to make use of the 
gold nuggets for your own purposes.

So there is no way I could sue you for using those nuggets if you refuse 
to sign it. Similiarly there is no way SOE could sue for violating the 
EULA if you clicked I disagree.

And to address somebody elses comment... its trivially easy to install 
everquest WITHOUT agreeing to the EULA.

So...

If I disagree with the EULA, who says I can't use the software? I bought 
the disk; copyright law forbids me from taking specific actions with it 
(reproduction/broadcast/etc..) but I can muck with its contents to my 
hearts content. No law forbids it and the EULA doesn't apply because I 
didn't sign it.

The thing is: No its not.

It becomes your property as much as the software does. Which is to say 
they that just like software: to an extent they do not.

When you buy models you are paying for the right to use those copies of 
the model. "That is it." to use your words.

You didn't buy the intellectual property. You can't go into business 
selling replicas of those models, selling posters with their 
likenesses... or violate any of the other rights the IP holder has 
retained.

Consider the simpler case of plastic models, and virtual models. (forget 
this vaguely defined "software" for the moment, just consider re-use of 
the *models*.
