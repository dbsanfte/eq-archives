Shissar in the Grey - undead snakes that are relatively easy kills.  Stick
to the area around the temple; the rockfiends stay away from there.  If you
find it overcamped, try the undying Iksar camps.  Those are a little
tougher, with a greater possibility of pulling three or four mobs at a time.

The big downside:  you'll need an EB item for this zone.  Or someone to cast
EB on you while you kill stuff.  If you hunt the Shissar, eventually you'll
collect three snake organs that you can turn in for an EB item in Katta.
