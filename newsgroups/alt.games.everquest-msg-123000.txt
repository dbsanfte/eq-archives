I have the same thing from time to time in Dreadlands, the game hangs when
gating in to DL or logging in a char camped out there.
I petitioned it and was suggested to uncheck all Luclin models and then turn
them on again one by one to find what causes it and then
/bug my result.
To this day (this started about 4 weeks back) i have still not found any
specific configuration that is foolproof, I still get lockups from time to
time wether i have
all or none of the Luclin models turned on and no specific model seems to be
the culprit.
