Some time ago, before the Battlecleric patch, I asked for someone
with access to Copelands or other weapon comparison
utilities to get me the DPS of a couple of my weapons.

At the time, battleclerics were certainly not where they are now
in terms of damage output, and the only response I got was
that both weapons had a  DPS of two... which didn't seem
possible and was later admitted to be a joke, but no actual
comparison ever got run.

Now with Yaulp V, battlecleric isn't such a joke.  The new
summoned hammer extension also seems to go a long way
towards making the idea palatable to people in general,
and I suspect that there is no use using any other weapon...
but I'd still like to see a comparison.

Hammer of Judgement vs undead
Hammer of Judgement vs non undead
Adjele's Ceremonial Cudgel
Righteousness
Epic

Would be the weapons I'm interested in.  I supect that the
above would be the correct order from most to last, assuming
a non resistant mob.  With a resistant mob, though, (so ignoring
procs), the cudgel might edge out the hammer vs non undead.

Righteousness has a stun proc (which is also 100 dd) and with
the yaulp V dex and haste on, should be more useful than
ever while facing annoying caster mobs, put a number of
Righteousness armed clerics on the mob and perhaps you'd
see serious reduction in annoyance.  Then again, try finding
a number of Righteousness armed clerics.

Hmm, assuming the utility keeps track of this stuff, my dex
should be 200 for the Hammer and 175 for the other weapons,
and I've got a 21% haste item on and run 25% spell haste
constantly.
