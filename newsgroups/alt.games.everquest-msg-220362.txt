Was merely giving an example from the other side.  That pet getting "fixed"
wasn't by my choice, but rather a girlfriend at the time who had a

They are all examples of "life happens" as the complications from having or
not having been "fixed" are fairly small either direction (and I believe I
even touched on this in another post to this thread).
