Currently swinging.... Pri Hand  A Lammy 9/19, STR and STA +6 HP +20
Sec Hnd Smoldering Brand 9/22, STR 3. These hit for a total of about
820 Per Min. With a 16 haste belt ( According to Copelands)

I would like to hit harder and increase HP and AC as much as possible
without spending more than about 6k on weapons. I am saving for cobalt
armor.

Any thoughts?
