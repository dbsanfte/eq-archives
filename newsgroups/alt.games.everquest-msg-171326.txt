Well I stayed too long in EW, 50 went well enough on wildlife,
but it took me a while to figure out that 51 was much slower.

Played around in DL a bit, and KC (grouped) but didn't care for
the exp rate there either.

Then I took a suggestion and went to the Giant Fort in BW.  This
is a nice spot, only Arbors are cyan, Verdants aren't all that
good but steady work, and ancients pop frequently enough that I
could stick to charming only them and keep mana afloat while
still getting nice exp boosts.

Problem is, the spot is popular, so I ended up having to share it
most of the day... a couple times I even logged out because it
just wasnt worth being there.

At one point I logged back in to a full repop and noone around, I
deliberately cleared the entire camp out and ended up having to
sit and wait repops.  This burned thru a substantial amount of
mana,  using strictly chant kiting I'd probably not keep it
totally cleared... but it means that having to share with more
than a couple people makes this camp into a loser.

SO I'm still looking for similar hunting grounds; must have melee
mobs that don't summon, aren't immune to run speed changes, are
charmable by 51 bard, and some nice add free running room... oh,
and must be outdoors zone, unless I can very reliably single pull
to a nice kiting circle area where I can snare kite, in which
case the exp bonus would have to make up for cutting out 1/4th my
chant output.

Of course this sounds like the shopping list of half the classes
in the game...
