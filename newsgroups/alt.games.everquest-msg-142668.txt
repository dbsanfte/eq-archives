 So somebody is the KS group on a raid. Big deal. Unless we're talking
something like Tunare where you have to clear lots of mobs, the xp
gained on most raids by the KS group isn't really enough to make them
"rich".

 I dont think he's saying the xp vanishes. I think he's saying that
there's a bigger purpose to raids so don't concern yourself with whether
you're getting xp or not.
