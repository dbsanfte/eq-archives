When I first started out in EQ, I was totally lost.  I didn't know how to
talk, how to respond to tells, how to set up hotkeys, nothing.  Took me 10
mins to figure out there was ground under kelethin and get up the nerve to
actually go down there.

Learned about /loc the hard way, some kind person gave me a sword and armor
but I lost it on my corpse because I didn't know that other classes could
find the corpse for me and I had no idea where it was.  I was actually
crying about that one, almost gave up playing because of that.

The nicest person I ever met was a chanter.  He figured out I was very new
and didn't know what the heck I was doing and gave me alot of great advice.
One of the most important was /assist.  He told me to stop pulling so he
could explain and took 10 mins to tell me what a chanter's job was, and how
mezz works, etc., etc.  Ever since then, I have tremendous respect for
chanters and always want them in my groups.
