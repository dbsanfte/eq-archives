    Can be raised with quests in Rivervale, although not at release. Could
also be raised with a halfling cleric's newbie note, and I wouldn't put it
past the devs to count that.

    Crushbone Orcs can be raised by killing the elves on Sister Isle, and
likely other elves. Nagafen originally went up by killing kobolds in Sol B,
leading to a very embarassing screenshot early on of a non-invis character
standing beside Nagafen. I'm willing to bet that killing barbarians in
Everfrost raises Blackburrow Gnolls, although I have no confirmation on
that. Inhabitants of Unrest I have no clue on. I'm not sure I believe the
claim myself, but it was made.
