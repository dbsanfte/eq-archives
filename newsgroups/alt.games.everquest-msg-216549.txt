From what I've seen, just about any group could take anything a standard
LDoN dungeon throws at them with 20% mana.  If you can't, it's not an issue
with me being more uber, it's an issue of me playing smarter.

Though I have heard that certain level disparities can make you end up with
a harder (or easier) dungeon, that doesn't happen with 65s.

Utter non-comprehension...   if I pull first and pull faster, it will speed
things up.  If I have no KEI or haste, it will slow things down.  But to
you, these are the same thing...

Everyone else is saying that they'd go ahead and pull at 30%?

I'm sorry, I must have misunderstood.  I'll accept that "everyone else is
saying" that I'm right then.  :P
