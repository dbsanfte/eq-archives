I don't care if they are selling them for 4,000 plat. I don't care who
you're going to do it to. You explicitly laid out your desire to
"definately" (sic) train people ... in the same thread in which you say you
were "seriously considering" training somebody else. You're the kind of
person I don't want playing the game.

While I certainly hope that is the case, your comments leave me doubtful.

Well, this is "wot" I have to say about those kinds of "peeps" ... but be
forewarned, I am going to attempt to use English.

Norranthian car dealers? I don't care about them. If I don't like the price
somebody is asking for something, I take the utterly amazing step of *not
buying from them*. It really is that easy. If somebody asks for 100pp a
stack of bat wings, more power to them. It does not matter to me.

When did it become your place to "punish" other people in the game because
you don't like their prices?
