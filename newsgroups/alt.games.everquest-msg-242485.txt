The bone chip market is really flooded but i have yet to see the spiderling
market ever approach that. Eggs are very useful but don't seem to sell well,
which as someone learning baking, i found odd; some of the foraged eggs can
be very useful. For my money, silk is the single best money earner; i just
wish there wasn't so many junk forms eg pristine silk. Silk swatches go for
about 25 pp each and it's a no fail combine!

There are mushrooms in kaladim that are quite important and a level 1
character could make a fortune killing rats and gathering the spawn of those
mushrooms.
