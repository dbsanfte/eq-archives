Say, for example, there's a quest NPC that requires some purchased items
from a merchant in the same zone. Let's use Captain Rohand in South Qeynos
as an example. He gives faction and a tiny bit of exp if you give him
Brandy.

Now, let's say someone wanted to do some serious faction work. (not that it
would require this, but let's just use it as an example) They could aggro
one of the bar merchants, pull him to Rohand, then root him and zone. (Or,
if they're an enchanter, mez and mem wipe.) They could then have both their
NPCs in one spot, and not have to run between them to get the items. I seem
to remember something like this happening in Erudin and Thurgadin too.
