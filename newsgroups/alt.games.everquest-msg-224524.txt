You'll switch to using the air pets again when you get them (next level for
instance).

51 earth pet doesn't have half again as many hp.  MS2 and 49 earth are about
the same hp, thus work about the same for reclaim.  Anything higher isn't
worth reclaiming for mana unless you've done the AA work (my magician still
hasn't, still using MS2 for pet canni at 65).

I'd check out www.magecompendium.com (think that's the main address, I go
straight to the boards) for some clues on how the HP/DDs stack up.
