I'm thinking wait a couple of months, at least.

1) EQ1 and EQ2 both up and running, players diverge to one or the other.

2) EQ1 and EQ2 both up and running, large overlap of players.

3) EQ1 goes into rapid decline.  (Note that a bunch of people in this very
newsgroup are betting *yes* in a pool here.  Anybody betting server
consolidation in 6 months is saying that EQ1's gonna die fast.)

4) EQ2 tanks.

As far as I can see, only choice (1) above would predicate a new newsgroup.
All of the others would benefit by no splitting.  For the moment, flagging
topics as [EQ2] should work quite satisfactorily, and has the advantage that
people can offer suggestions / snide comments across platforms with minimal
cross-posting.
