One of my extra computer is set for wireless network in my bedroom as
there's no netowrk hookup in the apartment and I don't want wires
running all over the floor.

The wireless access point and the wireless card installed in my PC are
both 54Mps Belkin brand 802.11g.  I have tried Linksys branded WAP but
no matter what I tried it refused to work with EQ and Linksys help
service were about as wonderful as hiring a bull to watch the china
shop.

Provided you have the WAP properly configured and have the security of
some type like 64 bit WEP to prevent outside users from leeching your
internet connection, it should be fine.  Never had a dropped
connection or LD's.  Occasional freezes that requires reboots but it's
a vintage 733MHz celeron with 256MB RAM and can run EQ with minimum
eye candy.

It's the router that would cause the most problem as it may
inadverantly block certain ports EQ uses.
