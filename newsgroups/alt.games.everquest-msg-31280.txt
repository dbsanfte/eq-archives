I've done some research on http://www.everlore.com/items and have come up
with the following statistics.
(also comparing to my current character stats)

Full set of Banded (some small, some medium, I think but not sure some might
be large).
AC = 78
Weight = 49.7

Full set of Bronze (Medium -- can Barbarians wear any small? I've got small
neck, shoulder, and few other banded pieces on me.)
AC = 103
Weight = 79.8
Cost (estimated based on prices shown) = 182 pp (could be near 200pp)

Full set of "Fine Plate" with exception of cloak piece (with exception of a
piece or two was only found as plate, and I chose medium on those).
AC = 115
Weight = 59.5
Cost (estimated based on prices shown) = 1305 pp

*1*  So now my big question is this.
Should I keep my 78AC 49.7 Weight banded armor (neck piece is leather, 3 AC
0.5 WT)?
*2*  Buy Bronze for now with its 103 AC (25 AC increase), 79.8 weight (about
30 increase, but I can not carry a bag of 6 stacks of bandages weighing
about 10 per stack, shorten it down to 2 or 3 stacks) and only spend about
200 pp at most? (and use this to get by on with much better AC until I save
up the 1.3Kpp for the fine plate)
*3*  Save up for fine plate and its 115+ AC, only 60+ weight (gain 20+ AC
and drop 20 weight), but have to spend 1300pp or more (likely near 1400pp?),
and possibly run into problems being the LV20+ warrior still in his LV10-15
banded armor?
*4*  Buy bronze now, and save for crafted (didn't look up stats)?
*5*  Stay with banded for now and save up for crafted (save LONG time)?

I am currently 1/2 bubble away from hitting LV18, have been hunting LV16-17
in N Ro (crocks and then did orc group for 3 bubbles of LV17), wearing
banded armor (with exception of my leather collar), and have 260pp in the
bank.
