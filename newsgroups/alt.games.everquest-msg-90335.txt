Absolutely.

  "Damn these human beings; if I had invented them I would 
  go hide my head in a bag."
     - Mark Twain, Letter to W. D. Howells, 1899 

  "I was gratified to be able to answer promptly, and 
  I did. I said I didn't know."
     - Mark Twain, Life on the Mississippi 

  "It is a mistake that there is no bath that will 
  cure people's manners. But drowning would help."
     - Mark Twain, "Marienbad--A Health Factory," 
       Europe and Elsewhere, 1923, 

  "Wagner's music is better than it sounds."
     - Mark Twain's Autobiography

  "Heaven for climate, hell for society."
     - Mark Twain, Tammany and Croker speech, 1901

And just to show that nothing has changed in 129 years:

  "An ignorance so shining and conspicuous as 
  yours--now I have it--go on a jury. That is your place."
     - Mark Twain, New York Weekly, 7/14/1873 (letter 
       originally written to Josh Billings, 3/1873)

My top three favorite "class-A wise asses" are
Mark Twain, Dorothy Parker, and H. L. Mencken.
Oscar Wilde is good too, but doesn't quite make
the top three.
