Possible zones:
16-20 Oasis of Marr
21-24 East Karanas
25-35 Marus Seru

I'm sure there are better places, but I if you're well twinked I would think
those zones should be doable.  I would suggest staying away from the Crag
Spiders in East Karanas.  They'll poison you and hurt your regen like the
Phlargs.  If you could find a way to get past the Phlargs, there's a series
of tunnels in Paludral not far from the Hollowshade Moor zone in.  The
tunnels have Sensai Mushrooms and those Luclin insect model creatures that
could take you up to level 23 or so.  They give good xp, but the insect
creatures might hit too hard to make soloing worthwhile.  You can usually
pull one at a time, but once in awhile there are two or three too close to
be separated.  It's a tough place to get in and out of without an
invisibility spell or gate.
