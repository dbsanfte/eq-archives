I used to know the exact CHA needed for the best prices from that merchant
(other things come into play like faction and how much of a tightwad that
particular vendor is) but it's 110, 115, or 120.  My guess is 120.  Others
have told you how to gain 50CHA...if that's not enough just do a search in
bazaar based on CHA.  It shouldn't take much money to do what you want.
