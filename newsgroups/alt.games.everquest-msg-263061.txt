It was rather dull and too slow-paced for an RTS, the graphics weren't
all the great, and the graphics engine was inefficient and laggy. But,
the biggest flaw was the first part... It lacked the "action" that
makes RTS's fun. Of course, I only played late beta, but it was pretty
close to live at that point, so I don't see how much could have
changed by release.
