    Imbuing is still a massive pain. Even with bots, you are limited by the
mana preservation and mana regen on the bot. Having this spell on a real
cleric with Mana Pres. or better, Spell Casting Mastery III, 15 points of
flowing thought, etc. makes a big difference. My guildleader used his tiny
cleric of Tunare to imbue emeralds once, and he was outpacing a bot
60-something necromancer's ability to twitch him - with KEI and bard song
running. He had me do them, and I was at 50m after doing twice as many (200)
with only self buffs and VoQ running. Oh, and I Yaulped when it faded.
