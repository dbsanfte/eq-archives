    "You're in our world now." SOE calls the shots with respect to EQ, so
unless this breaks the EULA or some other agreement between players and the
company, it's in the right. And like I said, given the other artifacts that
have been handed out at GM events, the power level of the reward isn't out
of line with a GM event award.

    Yes. The real "damage" that an award like this can cause on a server is
pretty limited. It damages the prestige of all previous such items earned by
others, and it can cause a shift in power between guilds in close
competition. The shift in power is not relevant in this case because the
warrior in question was not guilded. According to other posts, FoH was the
only guild on Veeshan with Blades of War. So if there was any loss of
prestige, the damage was done to a FoH member. If FoH isn't upset about this
(and I saw no posts indicating any of their members were, and did see posts
by one member actively sanctioning this) then there's no real damages, IMO.

    Yeah, those posts were pretty funny. "I'd destroy it, donate all my plat
to orphans, and start a halfway home in Neriak!" Suuuure you would.

    No, I tend to believe the "I'd keep it" people. ;-)
