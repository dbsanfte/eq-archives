    From what I've read: Sleeper runs amok, killing everyone in Sleeper's.
Then he runs amok in several other Velious zones (and possibly even
Veeshan's Peak), wiping out everything. He then poofs. From that point on,
the Warders (the four dragons that used to guard the Sleeper) will no longer
respawn. It's the Warders not respawning that makes Sleeper's "closed", as
the primary use of the zone is getting Primal weapons. Most Primals drop off
the Warders - some drop off other mobs, but the majority you get on a trip
come off the Warders.
