Proberly - not definate though. The Lizzy/Vinny posts showed a complete lack
of any sophistication whatsoever and if xlr8me is the same person then he at
least had the smallest clue in using a different connection and news client
to do his Lizzy/Vinny trolling from. If we assume this much sense in xlr8me
and then compare the complete and utter lack of any clue whatsoever in the
Lizzy/Vinny name change then it does seem a tiny bit out of place.

Then again - the sun has to shine on even a dog's arse occasionally...
