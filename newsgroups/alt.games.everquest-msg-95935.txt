Read what he said. He wants to use Legends as a way to bypass the usual
$50 fee to transfer from one blue server to another, which strips a char
naked, and instead pay $40 and get his char transferred fully equipped.

Your parenthesis of *directly* is the important part. No, you can't do
it, but I do know of cases where someone has transferred to a split
server, then asked to be transferred 'back' to the other server in the
split. Seems that when you ask to go 'back', they don't actually check
where 'back' really is, and take your word for it
