}OMG, someone else listens to Tom Lehrer.  My parents loved his stuff, and
}listened to it often, many years later I found some of his albums available
}on CD.  Some of it is quite dated, but much of it still holds up even now.

Heh, I learned a fair amount of history by asking dad who and what these 
people and events Mr. Lehrer was singing about were. 

And my life just wouldn't be the same without the Masochism Tango. :)
