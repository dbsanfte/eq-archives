Don't think so, but check www.allakhazam.com

I bought store-bought leather whenever I had enough money.  Keep an eye on
auctions for items that have WIS.  Of course, this'll be a bear for a while
until you learn what DOES have WIS. <g>

If you don't know what to do with your practice points, don't use them at
all.  There are lots of uses for them...wait 'til you figure out what you
want to do.

Hopefully Harmony was one of those spells you didn't think sucks.  It's by
far the most powerful outdoors pulling tool in the game.

As for what to have memmed at all times, that's really easy at level 10
since you don't have a lot of spells you use often.
Snare
Latest Skin buff (Skin Like Rock?)
Latest self-damage coat
Latest damage shield for others
Nuke
Root

At 14 you'll want to have SoW and Stinging Swarm up as well.  As you get
more spells up that you use often you'll have to decide which ones to keep
up for yourself...we all play druids our own different ways and they're all
good. :)

> 5.  Is my job a healing job  or  a fighting job in a group?

At level 10 if you're the only healer you should concentrate on that.  If
you have lots of mana you can do about anything you want.  At level 10 you
can still do decent damage in melee, though I think I'd aim more at nuking
(preferably with the Wind nuke to practice conjuration...you're going to
need that at 14!!).

> 6.  Where is the closest place to train and buy spells?   Qeynos?, West

Until level 19 you can only buy druid spells from druid guilds.  The druid
guilds are in Surefall, Rivervale, and Kelethin.  Go to
http://eq.castersrealm.com for a list of spells and their locations.

> 7.  Where is the best place to get gear , buy it, get from quests, or

Yes. :)   Sorry, no good answer here. At your level the best place is to buy
it and then replace it with critter drops when you can, then replace a piece
or two with various & sundry quest stuff.  Almost everything you'll get &
keep are critter drops, though.

No.  Anything with more intelligence than a bat should be thought of as a
non-player race.  Gnolls, orcs and goblins come immediately to mind.

At level 10...hmmm...anywhere that has spiders that you can kill.  WK is
probably good but NK & EK are probably too high for you yet.  Don't know
much about Everfrost.

Doesn't matter if you choose 1hb or 1hs (the couple you can wield).  As to
the particular weapon, it has to say "magic" when you inspect it for it to
hit magic-only critters like ghouls & wisps.  At your level the cheapest
magic weapon that I can think of that doesn't suck is a velium scimitar if
you can find a player selling one.  NEVER buy a weapon from an NPC vendor
unless you have money to burn...lots of it.  The only exception to that rule
is that if you have 50p laying around & can't find a player who can sell you
a decent magic weapon, you can buy a Combine scimitar from gypsy camps (NK,
Oasis...I think Lavastorm).  Try to go with the velium if you can, though.
