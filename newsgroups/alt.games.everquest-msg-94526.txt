  Your group killstole him, yes.  The mob "belongs" to the person who first
draws aggro... you can't "own" a spawn.  "Camps" only exist as a matter of
common courtesy and etiquette and he would be within his rights to report you,
though it sounds like he might have been better off trying to find somewhere
else to fight.  I'm not familiar with Highkeep goblins, but it might have been
the only place he could reach to hunt for experience within his allotted
playtime (if you're only going to be on for 30 minutes, the last thing you want
to do is spend 10 minutes travelling).

  Basically, avoid the mentality that you OWN an area.  In my opinion, camps are
valid sometimes, but really only for small, static spawns... not ordinary exp
camps.

  It sounds like he might have overreacted a little calling you "noobs", but he
did have a point... a full group of people fighting in Highkeep and not one of
them know what killstealing is..?
