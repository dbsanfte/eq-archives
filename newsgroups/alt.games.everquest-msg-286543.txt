Which of the newly combined, additive AAs continued to work?  Serious
question, as I'm not aware of any that did.  I know in my personal
experience the critical hit/heal AAs and attack enhancements (extra double
attack, etc.) were all broken.

I agree, they test whether a patch will crash the servers or the clients.  I
see some evidence of that (though even that isn't perfect).  They don't test
much more than that (as is plainly obvious every time something shows up on
live servers that never landed on the test server first).
