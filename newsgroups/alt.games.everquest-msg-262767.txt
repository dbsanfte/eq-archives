That's a nasty generalization there. Though I have been guilty of
casting a vote between two candidates for public office (though never
presidential) without any knowledge of either, I try to keep that from
being the case more often than not. I'm against voting straight ticket,
though I also believe that even zealots deserve to be counted, so I
suppose it has its place.

We still govern ourselves. It's mearly by a less direct means. Our vote 
is represented rather than counted. The intent is the same while 
providing facilities to handle certain specifics. I remember studying 
some of the reasoning for this system in Government class back in high 
school, but that was a long time ago, and I don't remember the details 
well enough to cite them here, but I remember it making some sense at the 
time.

I call bull on that one. That's just another cheap generalization. It 
serves as evidence of a less than objective view on your part than 
supporting your point of view.

No argument there.

I really do see your point, and agree that is makes a lot of sense....for 
voting on a pizza. I'll say it again. A presidential election should 
reflect the people's choice *for* president, not *against*.

If things are that close, then it's even more important for the results 
to reflect the true opinion of the people rather than 90% honest votes 
and 10% manipulatory votes. 

Any way you spin it, it all amounts to stacking the deck in an election 
is wrong.

...a tactic I'm not too thrilled about either.

Interesting viewpoint.
