First off, let me just say that I can only HOPE that my son (15 months 
now) is as skilled as yours when he gets to that age.  Congratulations.

As for your questions...

I would suspect that both of these options are good choices.  A good 
guild, large or small, and I usually prefer the smaller family type 
guilds, are a great addition to the gaming experience.  I have a group 
of friends and family who have played together for many years in many 
games and we also try to compliment each other in our choices of trade 
skills.  Between the bunch of us we usually manage to get at least one 
of each trade skill.  It is fun being able to supply each other and 
knowing that you have a source of equipment or supplies should you 
really need it.

Just my two coppers but I think you and he will enjoy everything these 
"add-ons" will give you.
