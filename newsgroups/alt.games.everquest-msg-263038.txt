What about LDoN? Would you just get rid of it on that server? Because
there is essentially no difference between grouping and saving the
plat for better gear or saving the adventure points for better gear
(except that you can't be handed Adv points I guess).

Personally, I think that spending lots of time saving plat/adv points
for some big upgrade, way down the road, is absolutely compatible with
the phenomenon of enjoying the game by slowly progressing in a
level-apropriate way.

I just don't think that adding no-drops would have the effect you're
looking for. There is some pretty good tradeskill generated gear,
which couldn't be no-drop or you'd destroy that tradeskill, or
alternatively people would just switch to that type of gear. There is
the issue with LDONs. I think you'd remove a big part of what makes
the game multi-player interactive.

By the way noone responded to my other post earlier, so I'll bring
this up again: Why not simply make higher end droppable items have
more value to merchants, (ie you get 1000s or 10000s of plat for high
value items instead of 100) which would effectively set a bottom price
for items. This would remove high end items from the game, and cause
some inflation which may help stabilize prices further (by
counteracting mudflation), in addition to making it more viable to go
out and hunt for items (because they will essentially not be
affordable). What do you think?
