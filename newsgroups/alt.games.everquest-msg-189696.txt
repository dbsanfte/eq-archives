From the shadows, the mysterious Matt <wwfjericho@iprimus.com.au> (if

Kurns got changed? I never heard that. And I'm pretty sure I would
have.

It's a bit of a sad fact now that you probably won't be able to hunt
for weapons at L20ish that are actually worth having anymore. It's
just way more cost efficient to hunt for money and then buy weapons in
bazaar.

So you want to hunt for money. Lots of other people here have given
advice on what sells for good money, I think Jazz had a really good
list of tradeskill items, maybe google for that. Otherwise get
yourself three or four more levels and then head for highkeep, where
the harder goblins often have fine steel and the merchants are right
thtere. Good money AND experience in that zone.
