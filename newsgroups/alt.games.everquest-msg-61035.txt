Because they are working on expansions which may require more
depending on some of the tweaks and enhancements, and want to know how
high would be too high on RAM requirements for the majority of their
users.

Yes, I remember the flack they caught...none of which was from the
courts. People objected. That doesn't necissarily mean it was illegal.

Why bother wasting time with such a pointless response here?

Yes, privacy...which is why they ASK rather than digging for the
information on their own. If you don't want to tell them the amount of
RAM you have, answer "Don't know" and be done with it. Or, less
desirably, lie. You don't HAVE to tell them, but that doesn't mean
they don't have the right to ask...
