Friends of mine have tried it, and Ive watched them. It seems to follow a
fair few EQish themes though the details are very different and so the
illusin in play seems very different.

Non combat related quest equivalents seem to be a lot more prevalent and
more useful, though some spawn combats. There are a lot fo things to do
solo, and a lot of these quests - they seem to drive the game more.

And you can just go looking for trouble......Ive not really seen anything
of grouping, or combat play as Ive only seen it briefly.

THe visuals are very scifi (OK crap description - high colour, swirling
space scenes, high tech areas for walking in). There are two distinct
phases of play - being in your ship, and running round space stations. THe
running round space stations is pretty much like being in a city area of
EQ, outside its more the wilds.

Movement is more themey as well, with local motion, short range jumps and
long range gateways although the basic spacing out of things effectivly
means zones of activity 

Class are more limited in number and I guess more focussed than the more
even spread from melee to caster of EQ because there's only 6. THe areas
of speciality are Warrior, Trader and Exlporer IIRC...with each of three
races focussing on one of those and having a hybrid with a second aspect
available to their race.

Tradeskills exist but infact are tied to class much more than EQ. And I
got the impression that kit is not as wide a selection as for EQ and a lot
more linear chains of ever improving kit - but I havent seen a a great
deal of it as I have said so that might just be a bias to what I have
seen and of course it could change as the game ages.

It did look to be the multiplayer game of Elite that has been begging to
be made for near 20 years, for it to pull me from EQ its going to have to
develop the community of EQ guilds, and while friends of mine are trying
the game thats not a decision I have to make now...if they settle into the
comunity there then I can go across...plus Im paid up with EQ for a
year...
