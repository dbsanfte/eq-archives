Dragons of Norrath. That's a 'could wait on' because the content
is for higher levels (60+ or so) except for one thing: The addition
of guild lobby/guild halls. If you are planning on joining a guild,
the guild hall is a good thing to be able to utilize. If you aren't,
the guild lobby is a great thing for recovering your corpse from
hard-to-reach places. But for lower levels, that shouldn't really
be much of a problem.
