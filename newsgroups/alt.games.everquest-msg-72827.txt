If you died 50 times at level 4 then frankly you weren't using your
brains.  Your an elementalist, did you boost your specc lines? Did you
hunt humanoid type mobs in order to get armor drops? No armor of
course your going to get owned.   At level 4, you have a self only
damage add. If your an avalonion elementalist then head down the road
and look to the left for a green glow. That's the Sylvan camp where
the juniors play. Stand at the far far end (or on the log), Nuke, nuke
nuke (they get in range) hit with damage added staff. Pick up loot.
Steady pops, steady good exp and coin along with some nice yellow and
blue magic items.
