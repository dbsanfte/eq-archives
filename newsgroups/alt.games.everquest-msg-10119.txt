I think the problem lies with the exchange of a 'real' commodity (cash or
whatever) being exchanged for a 'virtual' commodity.

This 'virtual' commodity is not yours to sell. It was generated by Verant
and they are allowing it to be used (by you or another player) within the
constraints they set in the EULA. They are leasing characters and items to
you for $9.99 a month. They can take it away at will. You do not 'own' any
EQ stuff in RL and can't sell something you do not own in RL for RL dollars.

Selling the 'item' for RL dollars lends itself to serious abuse.

How would you like it if Verant employees generated GBS's at will and sold
them on eBay?

I generally try to stay out of these threads, but I feel very strongly that
what I perceive as a work ethic is going down the tubes. People are just
after a quick buck by scamming, spamming, or otherwise trying not to do any
real work.

The only rationale for making money this way is if the individual is unable
to work due to some sort of physical impairment. You do what you can to
survive.
