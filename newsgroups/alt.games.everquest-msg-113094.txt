I have been in groups like that too and it really bugs me.  Sometimes people
just don't see the bigger picture.  This happened to me recently when I was
in Highpass.  I asked if a friend of mine could join the group (that made
4-which isn't really enough for that area) and the bard says "ok, but no one
else".  Then he procedes to get himself killed three times!  After that he
left and we got two more people and had no more deaths.

Then there was the group of 4 in the basement who wouldn't let anyone else
join, but trained us about 4 or 5 times.

If it's really bad I will leave a group like that because it is an accident
waiting to happen.  I hate corpse runs.
