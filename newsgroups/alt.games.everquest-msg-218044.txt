I've already disposed of the two warrior and two rogue pairs;
both are much better off as a duo than as two soloers. 
Rogue/Warrior would be Much better than either soloing and better
than either of the two pairs, because the warrior would be doing
what he does best, soak damage, and the rogue would be doing what
he does best, deal damage from behind the mob.  Since both are
melee, there would be no mana cost to having the rogue bind
wounds at the same time as the warrior, so you'd have the same
halved downtime as with the two warrior pair (and two rogue
pair).  The rogue wouldn't be as good as the second warrior at
off tanking or at taking over and tanking if the warrior is
getting too low on HP... but they are jobs he can do in a pinch,
and efficient soloing as a melee means avoiding those situations
anyway.

Key to warrior soloing is to always fight mobs you can kill on
less than 50% your HP, bind up to 50% and repeat.  Any team with
no healer uses the same trick.  

Question you always have to ask yourself about any duo is not "is
it better than a shadowknight plus a shaman" but "is it better
than the two soloing side by side?"

Only pair I've been able to come up with thus far that would have
to answer "no" is the two bard one.
