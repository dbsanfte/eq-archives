No expert here by any means, but here are my feeble observations.

SK- Pet worthless, but a character who can go toe-to-toe Solo with just
about any equal class NPC. And this just don't change from 1-60. Best
balance of Caster/Tank I have seen, BUT must have right skills advanced.
BASH is a Must, yet the 2HS is timeless. Only Character I have seen that can
"Career Solo".

Monk- Fast Leveler, and excellent Tank. But that will get you too about lvl
30. Good puller and ultimate damage taker. Wouldn't make a living fighting
any Casting NPCs for long, but I may be wrong.

Pally - LOL  Next
