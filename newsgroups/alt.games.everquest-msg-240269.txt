All code of which was made and generated by Sony. So either they're
violating their own copyright or just exercising their right to copy
and then destroy the original based on a user request to transfer plat
from their player to someone else's player. If I, JoeBlow want to give
50pp to JaneDoe... i hand it to her, that activates code which opens
up the transfer window, we both hit agree and the game gives it to one
player while deleting it from the other. Sony dictated how the plat
was to be copied, who can do it and when, that it had to be deleted
from the original once transferred, and therefore its not a violation
of copyright law. All I see is them exercising their rights to dictate
how the plat is to be copied, beyond that they have no control over
nor can they reasonably assert that copyright law was violated because
it was their code which did the copying.

Right to Use agreements, EULA violation? You might have a case,
neither of which breaking is illegal. Yeah... I can see Officer Popo
arresting me because i violated Sony's EULA HAHAHAAHHA. At worst they
can revoke the license provided the user who commits the infraction
and ban them from the game, which they do from time to time, but
that's about it and usually its after repeated abuse, if at all.
