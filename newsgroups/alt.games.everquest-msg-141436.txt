Yeah - I was wondering about tha t too, I have an ranger that just dinged 20
last night which had been dual weildinglammies becuase I was under the
impression you could never get more than 20 damage from a high regardless of
the weapn used until after level 20. But I noticed a 2 hander Ranger only
weapon with 17 damage and only 24 delay (sweet 2 hander raiser) was
consistently geting hits up to 38.

*confused*
