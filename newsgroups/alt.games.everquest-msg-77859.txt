Wow, that sounds so great, I'm totally going to be sending you my password
and account info right now, along with my credit card #s just so you can
cross reference them if need be.  It's really to bad that Sony/Verant would
have to outsource to Hotmail, I guess they simply don't have the hardware to
add one additional mail servers to their fleet of  thousands already.

This makes sense!  Thanks so much for giving us this information, it's guys
like you that really bring the community together.
