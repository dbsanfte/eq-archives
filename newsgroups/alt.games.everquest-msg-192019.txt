To clarify, not a single person has my monks login info (even my girlf
doesnt, and shes an eq player)

Sure account sharing does happen.. I think PoP quadrupled the amt of
info-sharing in guilds, simply because if you missed "a_specific_raid", you
were then fucked for progression and future raids which required the
original raid flag

I have about 15 guildies login infos (for the general purpose of PoP
flaggings) - but this is people who asked me, I would never ask or demand
somebodies info.
