Heart Flutter and Asystole (sp?) I have used to great effect, and
while they may or may not resist via disease, I do not really consider
them disease DoTs. The DoTs I have the question about are the 'true'
disease spells (Disease Cloud, Scourge, Plague, etc.) that do a
minimal initial damage and then do almost nothing per tick by
comparison with the other lines of spells.

Case in point: Scourge. It is a level 39 spell that does something
like 500 total damage over the course of a couple of minutes. I tried
using it once or twice just to test the supposed 'stops the target
from regenerating' effect, but frankly I would always un-mem it in
disgust after a few kills. For equivalent mana I could cast one of the
other DoTs I had at the time (Venom of Snake comes to mind) and get
the same damage yield in a fraction of the time. The comparisons
always seemed so heavily against Scourge that it was almost laughable.

IF the diseaase line does in fact stop the regen of the target (a hard
thing to test unless the regen is normally more damage than the spell
does each tick) I can see the use for it at some times. If it debuffed
or caused stamina/strength loss I would use it happily. But as far as
I can tell, the spell is no blasted good at all.

Has anyone ever tested the 'stops target's regen' effect and been able
to prove that it works?
