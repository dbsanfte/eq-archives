Let's Take a Step back here, and throw another theory into the ring.

Have you ever noticed the Celestial Uniqueness of Norrath?

Norrath is a Class M (you know the Class M thing, read your star trek) 
planet with 6 coninents and Every possible ecosystem, but also 
completley devoid of all but plantlife until the Pantehon arrived. The 
planet revolves around it's Star, Ro, and it's own axis at an incredible 
rate, (45 minute days, people) Yet still has Earth's Gravitational pull 
by some freak of science. Norrath Has 2 Moons, Luclin and Drinal, and, 
although not much is known about Drinal, Luclin remains in SYNCHRONOUS 
Orbit around the planet, spining on its axis and around luclin at just 
the right speed for there to be no progression to day or night.


...No wonder Veeshan thought Norrath was a funky place to put her brood.
