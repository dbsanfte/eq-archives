Personal problem. I'll grant you that one.

Window transparencies. I never have a problem telling what's going on
behind the chat, etc windows.

Change font colors. In windowed mode, I have more trouble seeing the
chat text than in non-windowed...I have a much lower range of visible
colors than I do in non-windowed. The HP bar is more visable in
non-windowed, IMO. *shrug* No little thing covering the ends of the HP
bar blocking visibility of the a portion on either end.

Only buttons I don't have access to in non-windowed are the options. I
can hotkey the options button and get to them pretty quickly from
non-windowed. I really don't understand, however, the need for access
to so many buttons you have to fill more than 3 or 4 hotkey banks and
remember which is where.

It's not a matter of immersion to me. It's a matter of what looks
nicer and visability. I play in a rather high resolution, and windowed
mode ends up giving me this tiny little box with the "world" in an
even tinier little box...
