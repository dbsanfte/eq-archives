Since the level 58 heal, Ive had absolutely no problem getting a group as a
druid. I usually end up playing my druid as main healer since its very rare
that my chanter is wanted these days. Last time I was in sebilis, I got a
couple of /tells asking me to join their groups. If you already have rez's
covered, then a druid has so much more to offer... snare, evac, mana regen,
sow if outdoor just to name a few.
