I hadn't used the firepot room, and found myself with some time to
kill Saturday morning, so decided to check it out.  I took the boat
from Oasis to TD, loaded up Selos Song of Travel (invis, lev, run real
fast), and explored the zone somewhat looking for places to solo.
After finding one or two spot that I think I may be able to solo, I
headed to the firepot room.  I made the rather silly mistake of NOT
taking off Song of Travel before I swam down the tube, and hit the
ground and bounced right into a random firepot.  
I was more than a bit miffed, and was sure I would end up someplace I
didn't want to be, like Neriak or Erudin.  Luckily I had hit the
firepot to take me to Ogguk, where I did most of my banking and such
from about level 30 to level 45.  You pop up close to the zone line,
around the corner from the first vendor.  Unless someone has pulled a
bouncer to the zone line, you are perfectly safe.  I haven't tested
Grobb or Neriak yet, but I think you would be fine in Grobb at least.
(I'm still dubios in dark-elf form, and killed thousands of crushbone
orcs, so I never go to Neraik.)
Also, I thought that rogues could sneak/hide across zone lines?
