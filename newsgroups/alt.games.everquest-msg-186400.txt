For me it was level 50+.  Our group got an OBS in Seb, and I think it is 
worth about that much.  Not positive, since a rogue won the roll.  Our 
small guild killed Lodi 6 times when we had him timed, and got 7 shells and 
1 belt from him in that time.  The Shields were going for 18-25k and the 
belts were at about 25-32k.  Gotta love it when some chump tells a guild 
ranger that is sitting at Lodi's spawn that there's no way in Hell OUR 
guild can take Lodi.  This was after kill #5, I believe.

When you get over level 50 or so, head to Seb and learn the place. I think 
there are some decent drops there.
