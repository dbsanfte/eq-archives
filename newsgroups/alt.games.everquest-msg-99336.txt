No, allakhazams said nothing about passwording them. The channels don't 
have to persist, since if they get deleted because noone is in them, they 
will get recreated as soon as someone does '/join tradeskills' or whatever. 
Passwording them just locks everyone out who will have no idea what 
password has been set.
