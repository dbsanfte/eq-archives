I was wondering something similar...
I, for the life of me, cannot remember the few items I have seen like
this, but the stats totally suck (IMHO).
has a recommended level of 51 or some such, and all the stats are like
svm 1 svp 1 svd 1 etc...  and they sell for a very sick price for the
stats.   with no other redeeming features like focus, or effect.

now I am looking at these with my bazaar mule who is level 1.... so do
the stats increase with the level or is it only for damage / delay
that are in (  ) ?


thanks for your time
