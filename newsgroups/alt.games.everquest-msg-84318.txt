I have done the Hero Bracer quest about 20 times now. You can have the
minotar hero SHACKLE ready to turn in for the bracer and the Hero Bracer at
the same time. But if you turn in the shackle while holding the Hero Bracer
on you or in the Bank you will be given the exp but NO Bracer. Everything
looks like you should have the bracer but NO Bracer. I did this once with a
Hero Bracer in the Bank thought the quest was broken before I petitioned I
checked the bank and low and behold a Bracer was sitting there.
