For what it's worth, I think the requirement of a credit card will
make a significant cut in the number of people playing it. Not
necessarily that the worst ones will be kept out, simply because the
most annoying ones are those that their parent's haven't sufficiently
disciplined. So getting their parent's credit card would simply
require a bit more of the whining and wheedling that they probably
already get away with.

I think it will probably be a wash in the short term. In the long term
it'll depend on how much of a unified front the respectable people put
up. Because of the persistent nature (and the fact that you can't
simply change your characters name to get away from a bad reputation
(God, I hope they don't let you change your name)) should mean that
people who cheat and generally behave badly will quickly find
themselves ostracized. On the other hand it depends on if the server's
respectable population does come up with a unified front. It is at
least beneficial that these people that are so annoying, tend to be
annoying to one another as well, so they tend to have trouble working
together for any length of time. (The lack of people grouping that has
been mentioned earlier in the discussion is one huge example of this,
annoying people will seldom put up with each other enough to be more
annoying to others...)

PK groups are an exception to this, but only in so much that in games
where you find PK groups, are games where you have to group in order
to succeed in PKing. In general they will only band together when they
have to. Griefers, generally work solo, with only a few spectacular
exceptions.
