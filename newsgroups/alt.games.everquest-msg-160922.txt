Incidentally, clerics with PoP now get two spells (at levels
19 and 39, Blessing of Piety and Blessing of Faith) which
give a buff with this effect (only 10% though). According
to caster's realm, this effect does stack with focus items.

The similarities extend to the limitations (must be >=3 secs
and CHeal is unaffected). The main advantage is that as a
buff it doesn't use an inventory slot, but *as* a buff it needs
occasional refreshing (after 40 mins).

I agree focus effects are a good thing. :-) Unfortunately
there aren't many focus items which are good, useful to
clerics and affordable (particularly for an untwinked cleric).
I had a Polished Bone Hoop from about level 14-30
but it's useless for high-level spells.

One advantage to accumulating high-WIS items is it gives
you the freedom to swap out something less good if you
find something with a great focus effect.
