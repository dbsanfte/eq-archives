How is inviting somebody in a MMORPG, to join a group, rude?

People were complaining they were getting invites from much lower level
groups, which suggests high level slummers.

Wtf are you on? Does this paragraph even have a point, or is this more of
your drivel.

Personally, have only ever been to Rathe for quests /shrug prefer to exp
while getting cash.

Wow, I am so upset you don't value my opinion <jumps off nearest tall

That fact doesnt make you less of an asshat though, now, does it?

Having someone click invite, is not rude, no matter how many <> you use.

A game is NOT RL, no matter what you say, it is NOT personal, I doubt
anybody acts the same way in RL as they do in ANY online game.

Click decline, and walk away, how hard is that, or just tell them you dont
want to join? Though, I am sure someone of your mental disposition could
find someway to consture that as 'rude', you complain they are being rude,
but I wonder what your response is when somebody commits the heinous act
upon you, judging by your reaction here, I can guess it would go beyond
rude.

I repeat EQ is NOT real life, people do not and never will act in a GAME as
they do in REAL life.

Campstealing is rude, killstealing is rude, begging for rezzes from an
exping group is rude, inviting somebody who is standing next to your exp
group, to exp, is NOT rude (wtf are you standing around there for anyway,
your uber, go exp).

/awaits more bizbee drivel
