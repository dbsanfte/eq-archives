[can't recall the first line],
While strolling down the lane in [Dixie?] Pride
Not a word did I utter, as I lay there in the gutter,
When this pig come up and lay down by my side.

Not a soul was I disturbing, as I lay there by the curbing,
When this high-toned lady stopped, and I heard her say:
"You may tell someone who boozes, by the company he chooses",
And the pig got up and slowly walked away.
