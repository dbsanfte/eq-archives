    There's a lot of great stuff in this patch, and only a few kicks to the
teeth. It's also nice to see some more caster balancing ideas migrating to
the Live servers.

    Now that the new zone is live, so are the new baking recipes! You can
make pasta, and grilled cheese sandwiches, and even patty melts! (You were
the one assigned to baking duty for the Earrings, right?) And there's a
quest in the new zone that requires baking - IIRC it's the continuation of
the Qeynos Investigator's Badge, but I'm not certain there.
