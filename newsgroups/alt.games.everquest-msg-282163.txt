As I've said in here before, and I'm not doing so as a Sony Apologist, our
guild is doing better than ever, our little casual raid alliance is doing
better than ever, and I'm having more fun in EQ than ever.

And I've been playing a few years now.

Much of that is because of the peer group around me, and I can't deny if
you don't have that peer group the game can seem dead.
