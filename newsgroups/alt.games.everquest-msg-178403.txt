If he doesn't have a BA Medallion, either buy one or get the pieces
for the Fine Antique Ring quest in PoK (Mana Preservation II items).
If he doesn't have Affliction Haste, get him a Chrysoberyl Talisman
or equivalent (dunno if INT caster can us it).  Yes, I know that
Enchanters mostly depend on stuns in panic situations, but fast root
can be very valuable (most giants can't be stunned, for instance),
and a fast slow doesn't hurt.  Affliction Efficency and Extended
Affliction focuses will work for your roots and slows, and should
work for 29+ DoTs (dunno his level, low level Enchanter DoTs are
apparently too short to be classed as "afflictions" for focus items,
and mez also is not extended).  Moonstone Ring is a cheap way to get
Extended Range II.  Drakescale Belt gives Extended Enhancement II
(I think Kobold-hide Boots are an alternative for that), which works
on haste, blur, illusions, & etc.  There're tons of cheap robes out
there.

Actually, there's so much decent "lowbie" gear out there, at sometimes
astonishingly low prices, that the best advice is probably just go to
the Bazaar and shop.  I'd look for focus effects first, and then go
after INT/Mana/HP not in any particular order.
