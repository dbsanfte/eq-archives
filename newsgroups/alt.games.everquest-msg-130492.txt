Ok, I'll be brave.  Cocksucker.  Cocksucker.  Fuck, fuck, cunt, asshole.
When do I get my medal?
   Oh, btw, the spellchecker on my netscape browser thinks that "cocksucker" should
be "cock sucker" and "cunt" should be "count".  I told it to go ahead and be brave
too, and learn the new words.  Apparently, I had already  taught it about "fuck" and
"asshole" a while ago.
