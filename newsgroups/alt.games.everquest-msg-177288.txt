For inexpensive to raise tradeskills, Brewing is probably at the top of the
list, you can raise it up to 248 on cheap vendor purchased supplies.  It's
utility at making money is a bit more questionable, but there are some nice
stat drinks you can brew and sell at a decent profit.  Fishing is probably
the cheapest to raise to 200 of them all.  Baking is not expensive to raise
to a fairly high level, just requires a lot of hunting to get the
ingredients, unless you want to buy them off players and/or vendors.
Fletching is not extremely expensive to get up to 202, after that, the cost
starts to go up, unless you want to farm for ingredients.  Tailoring can be
cheap, but extremely time consuming, you can skillup on acrylia armors up to
at least close to 250, but you need to farm serious amounts of drops for it.
Pottery is cheap to raise up to 198 or 199.  After that, you can actually
make money on it by making Golden Idols.  I have made a profit on Pottery,
any my pottery skill is 196.  It's not a huge profit, but, it is a profit.
The skillup rate on pottery has been nerfed though, so it is a lot harder to
raise the skill than it used to be.
