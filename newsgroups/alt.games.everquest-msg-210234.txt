I *always* ask for a CHA buff when pulling in tier2+.  If I can't get 
one, I'll swap out weapons for steins (not so much of an issue since 
switching to archery).  Yes, the jump from my 85ish to 135ish helps a LOT 
both with resists and with mobs aggroing on resist.

The BoT layout has mobs more tightly packed, so you'll usually need to 
pass the joint to more than one mob per pull, and there tend to be a lot 
more turns and narrow hallways than in HoH, so you have to be careful 
when going around corners.  It's sometimes difficult to see the mob 
waiting right around the corner to get him targetted.  You still want to 
keep your CHA up in here.

With a warrior you'll want to pull with something like snare.  Just snare 
when the mob gets close and you won't be waiting forever and a day for it 
to get to the camp.  I've found that the shaman can usually land the slow 
without pulling aggro at all after even a single snare.

With a pally or SK feel free to pull with a jolt.  Usually 1 or 2 casts 
from them will ensure nobody pulls aggro off of 'em for the duration of 
the fight.
