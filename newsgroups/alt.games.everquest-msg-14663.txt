Also, think about the effects on a group of high level players, being
told they can no longer be guilded with their friends. You aren't
allowed to simply reform under a new name.

Being split from your friends, and effectively unable to raid any more
will cause many of them to quit anyway. Especially if they feel the
actions taken against them was unwarranted

I realise they aren't being banned, but cause and effect, the end result
is that a lot of people won't be playing any more as a direct result of
the punishment
