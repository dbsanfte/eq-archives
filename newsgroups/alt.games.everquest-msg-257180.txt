If you have to explain a joke, the guy hearing it just isn't going to 
laugh. Nonetheless, I will point out that I personally thought it was funny.

And that it could explain why someone might think bow and ranger go 
together.

And what, pray tell, were 1, 2, and 3, the more popular choices you 
skipped over?

Not that it really matters, since I only needed to demonstrate that 
there's -some- reason someone could look at the word ranger and make the 
connection to ranged weapons, even if thats not the derivation that most 
people use.

Its still entirely relevant.

How does standing in one place and bashing on things with blunt 
instruments, slashing them with sharp things, and poking them have 
anything to do with even a more relevant definition of range?

Kiting, whether it be bow kiting or fear kiting, that does offer a fair 
amount of roaming about.

Being a support fighter, hitting things from out of the front arc in a 
stand up fight, though, perhaps we should call them TOETOTOErs.  Or 
BACKSTABbers... cept that one's taken.

Lets look at the word Rogue while we are here.  Seems to me it suggests 
someone who goes it alone, works outside the group, if not contrary to 
the group.  Yet this is the most group dependant class in the game, 
surpassing even the cleric in lack of efficiency in soloing.

If there was a class called the Grouper, I'd expect to see SOE arguing 
that they are of course intended as a solo class, and thus suffer from 
ill effects while grouped.

Class names are reasonably unreliable as indicators of what they really 
do; nearly as unreliable as what a Prima Guide book might say!
