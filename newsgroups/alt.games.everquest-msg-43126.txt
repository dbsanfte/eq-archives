Just got my broadband Internet connection up and running yesterday.  Might
just be time to try a bard now, lag times between 70 and 140ms, on a
wireless broadband connection (It was that or satellite where I live).
Zoning in Kunark still seems to take forever, zoning in Antonica usually
goes very fast.  Packet loss seems to be unchanged.

I would appreciate any recommendations people can offer for setting up my
netgear 314 to maximize security and still allow me to play EQ trouble free.
Right now, I have it in it's default settings, and it works like a champ.  I
do plan on purchasing firewall software tonight as well.

TIA
