I used to get that when talking to one guy from Asia. I didn't know anyone else from there so i don't know if that was 
relevant, but as his English was poor anyway, it was very frustrating. He'd type "so" when he meant sow or soe, and i'd 
explain that i kept losing the last character and ask which one he wanted. "So", he'd reply. We were going through a lot 
of zones in those days where the choice could be crucial. Oh well.
