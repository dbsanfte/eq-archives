I had heard of this for a while now, but logging into Allakhazam this
morning and saw the news item regarding how to run this program and
did a double take.

Anyone else suprised at such a respected web site that endorses a
program that essentially violates EQ's EULA? Well Im assuming that it
does, although it doesnt specifically mention reverse engineering (it
seems to fall somewhat under item 9 in the Eula). This program must
sniff the incoming packets from EQ - in order to collect your
characters information. Im kind of suprised that SOE has turned a
blind eye to this. Well, ok - not too suprised.

Also, running any program savvy enough to perform such an operation
also makes me nervous. Not that I think Allakhazam is trying to do
anything devious, but its a program that wasnt developed by them, just
aqcuired recently, so Im doubting they have actually examined the
source code (if they even have it) and wonder how well they know/trust
the source of this program. Whos to say that it doesnt record
keystrokes as you log in and sends them to some unknown location? Just
me being paranoid Im sure, but you still hear about people's accounts
being hacked and they have no clue as to how it happened.
