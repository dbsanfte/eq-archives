Gawdddd then don't use it!

You know, finally you don't have to make the choice beween sacrificing gear
for utility and foci (mana regen, improved damage and such) if you aren't a
highish raider that can get items with stats AND foci/effect.. and people
still have reason to whine.

100hp/mana belt, or 40hp/30mana ft2 belt?  That choice used to suck, or
maybe a summoned improved damage bracer, or a "stats" bracer? gee tough
call.  Oh wait, tribute master lets me gain those effects without losing
real items stats..

Nm, I have to run 2 zones to get to my tribute master, it sucks!
