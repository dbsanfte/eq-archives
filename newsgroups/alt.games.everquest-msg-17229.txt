I was in NFP over the weekend, and some nimrod does a drive by invite...
well gee, I'm just trying to off load a ring of frost, and provide some low
cost ports out of NFP, so I don't have a lot of interest in grouping....
decline.

Guy invites me again... decline.

I go into the bank to get some money for a spell someone is selling me (I
really need to turn auction off when I'm selling... save my money).  Guy
follows me, and invites me again! ... decline.

/tell nimrod, "something you need?"
nimrod: "accept."
/tell nimrod, "why?"
nimrod: "accept group."
/tell nimrod, "no thanks."

I still have no idea what he was thinking... he was /anon so I don't know
what class or level he was, save that he was red to me.  I know what I can
do to people if they foolishly accept groups with me and I'm feeling
maliscious, I don't know why someone would think that I would accept a group
with no better reason than "accept group."
