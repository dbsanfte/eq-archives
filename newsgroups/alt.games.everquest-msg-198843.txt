Khura's Focusing is the group version of Focus of Spirit, so, it can be 
cast on a level 1 that is grouped with the shaman, or grouped with someone 
of the appropriate level.  Both group and single target Focus are level 60 
spells, there are upgrades to both at higher levels.  Alternatively, 
Harnessing of Spirit is a single target spell castable on a level 1 that is 
not as good, but, still not bad.  For strictly Dex, there are a couple of 
different group Dex buffs available, depending on level.  Talisman of the 
Cat, or Talisman of the Wrulan.  The Dex buff does not currently stack with 
Focus/Harness though, and does not last as long as Focus/Harness, so stick 
with Focus or Harness.  I think base time of Khura's Focusing is 1h 20m, 
not certain off hand.
