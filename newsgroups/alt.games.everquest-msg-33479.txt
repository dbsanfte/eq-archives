I was thinking about a limited life cycle for your character. Say when you
begin the toon he/she is aged 18 and then slowly ages as the 'years' go by. The
apperance could change in ways such as : hair can grow, fighters can become
broader, ogres fatter, in fact they could have the state of your character in
constant flux so that his/her apperance reflects his actions (a'la creatures in
black and white). Maybe your character goes bald as the years pass, or grey
haired and perhaps visible scars from your closest encounters, and tatoos. And
your stats could increase up until a certain age when youre in your 'prime' and
then slowly decline so that the only thing your battered self is good for is
spinning yarns to fresh faced newbies in EC tunnel. And of course it would all
end one day in a shuffling from your mortal coil, no rez permitted, and that
could lead to funerals and the permanent retiring of your avatar in a
graveyard.
what do you think?
