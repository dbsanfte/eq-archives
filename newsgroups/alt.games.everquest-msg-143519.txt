Actually, no.

The FBSS is always superior.

If you are not Main Tank, you shouldn't be getting hit, so having lower AC
isn't a problem, and boosting your damage by 20 percent is good.

If you are the Main Tank, and everyone is using haste items except you, (and
really, very very few people don't have a haste item of some kind by 50)
you're going to have serious problems holding aggro, and your grand HP and
AC ratings will all be completely worthless, since it's beating on the
ranger instead.
