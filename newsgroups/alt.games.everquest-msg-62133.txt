One off the top of my head is Drolvargs.  Drolvargs will aggro an Invis-by-
spell  character if they're close enough and dawdle.  A rogue can sneak
and hide (in front of) a Drolvarg all day and they won't notice.

Some critters that are "born" seeing Invis might not see a rogue
hiding.  Any critter which CASTS See Invisible on itself and its
friends WILL see that rogue hiding, although you can still sneak
behind 'em.
