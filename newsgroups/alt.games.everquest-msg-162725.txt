All mobs can breathe underwater.  All mobs also take no damage from falling.
Your pets are mobs, for these purposes.  So are you, should you ever be chamed
by a mob.

Yes they can.  For most purposes, however, it would be quite a waste of money to
give them any, since it will vanish when they die or you log.  Mages can summon
some armor, though, that effectively gives them a way to buff up pets in a way
that doesn't wear off with time (assuming the pets never die) and yet doesn't
cost any cash or tedious to camp items.

I don't know about pets using the bash skill.  Some pets are of varying classes,
so its possible that some do and some don't.  You'd have to ask a mage, and a
necromancer, for details.
