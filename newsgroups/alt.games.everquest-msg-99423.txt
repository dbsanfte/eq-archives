Yes, yes, I was the one who made the uncouth remark about chimps with
Uzi's.  But I have to say this. That was one of the funniest things I've
read in ages. Well done. And I hope you figure out that necro and give
it a go. In the end, if you *must* e-bay something, at least doing a
soloist character like a necro or a druid is less risky to the general
populace, and with your attitude and sense of humor, it's probably not
such a bad thing anyway. 

Now, if you'd bought a 55 *chanter* and suddenly showed up volunteering
for a DN raid........

RaidLeader shouts, "ADD! ADD! Two more rats."
Cleric_01 says, "CHeal chain down to 40 Mana. How much left on the
Dragon Construct?"
Tank_01 says, "This thing is taking *forever* and hitting like a TRUCK.
Are you SURE it's slowed and debuffed?"
Cleric_02 says, "30 Mana. We should be fine, they just need a couple
more... OUCH! HEY! THERE'S A RAT EATING THE CLERIC! No, TWO RATS!!
HELP!"
RaidLeader shouts, "ADD! I *said* ADD, DAMNIT! Rastus, park those rats!"
Rastus says out of character, "Ummmm... hang on..... errr.... Is that
one of the green ones?"
