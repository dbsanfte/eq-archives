Aggro kiting does not preclude melee.  What it precludes is sponging; the idea
is that -noone- takes damage, because the mob is too busy doing what we normally
try and avoid; chasing a caster.

It's quite possible for a melee who is not using taunt or aggro producing
weapons to beat a mob senseless while it runs circles trying to catch someone
more annoying.  Since -not- getting aggro is important in raids, learning here,
where the results of mismanagement are immediately visible, somewhat painful,
but not harmful on a big scale, is convenient anyway.

Too, its good training for the casters, who can see exactly what kind of aggro
the spells they cast can produce, can steal aggro from each other, can see which
spells don't do much (the melee gets aggro; wow, that spell must not be high
taunt...which is a bad thing here but a good thing in most raids)

What sucks about it, from the melee standpoint, is keeping the mob in melee
range.  Aggro kiting is worse than fear kiting for this, as the mob is at the
whim of both pathing -and- the changing location of its target.  Two of  the
best plans I've seen are an elongated oval, where the kiter runs a long straight
line, then loops around tight just out of melee range of the mob, and a tight
circle; my bard can spin around tight enough that he's had people ask him when
bards got root; the answer is the mob is standing in one place spinning trying
to keep track of the moving target.  While this might be beyond the reach of
slower moving individuals like druids, I -have- seen them move a mob in a tight
enough circle that a stationary melee could just spin in the middle and keep
hitting.  Neither of these circle plans allows one of the best advantages of
aggro kiting with melee though, which is the constantly exposed back; backstabs,
no dodge or parry, no ripostes.
