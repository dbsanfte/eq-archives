You made out better than my Wizard.  I've got (from memory):

1. Two reagent conservation I items.  All the reagent spells I use are above
20 (levitate is 24, and the <=20 skins are worthless at level 52).

2. One that helps summoning undead pets.  Worthless for a Wizard.

3. Summoning haste.  Doesn't seem to work on Eye of Zomm or on Halo of
Light.  Too low to work on my familiar, assuming that it even works on
familiars at all.  Apparently worthless for a wizard.

4. One that makes buffs last longer, and is III even.  Tried it with jboots,
and got nothing.  I didn't see any message when putting on my shielding
buff, either.

5. One that increases range for DD.  That actually works!  Low enough level
that it will only be useful when using a small nuke to finish something off,
and that is rare (Draught of Fire is only 215 mana, and so if the mob has
more than 150 or so hitpoints left, it is better to DoF and be sure, rather
than maybe have to cast a small nuke three times, which will end up using
more mana).
