I can't say I liked it, but it wasn't really a film to be liked or disliked,
it was something to leave the theatre with a new perspective on life, during
the show I thought about the French people, as part of the movie occurs in
France, and actually there were several French characters in the film, which
is odd as you hardly ever see any French people in movies today.

Anyway, I thought a lot about the French who live in France and why they
don't want to fight in the upcoming melee, and I would assume that it is due
to a total lack of respect for them and what they are capable of doing. I
can tell you right now that they don't give a crap about offending the EU or
the UN, they probably just want a little respect as they are not the best at
anything, but apparently are good enough to warrant attracting as an ally.

I guess tommorow I will try to devote the day to the French, to see what
they are all about as I actually never gave it much thought.
