Hello all,

Whehey, woo and considerable amounts of hoo. My wizard made 16. And now the
reseaching starts. I've read up on the skill on many a site. Having done so,
here's what I think I should do.

Don't bother yet.

The way I see it, I can train just the one point in it now, reaching my
skillcap for the next three levels untill 19, one point again, and then to
20. As such, going all the way to get my concordance of research to start
practicing the skill is pointless untill 20. At 20 the gating around starts
making it all so much easier. So...is it indeed as smart as it apears to
forget about research untill 20? Or am I missing the point, something that
does not fall beyond the realm of possibility??????

any thoughts?
