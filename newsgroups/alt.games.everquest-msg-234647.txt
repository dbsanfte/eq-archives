Um, SOE created the item in question.  And didn't you learn in your
copyright class that one right in the bundle of rights that constitutes "a
copyright" is the ability to assert how your creations are to be used by
your licensees?

Sure, the notion of platinum pieces and how they work ingame isn't such a
revolutionary concept that SOE would be able to sue any other MMORPG maker
who used platinum pieces as currency in their game, but that's not the issue
here.  The issue here is the use of their intellectual property.   The
entire concept of platinum ingame changes if the player has a property
interest in it, and are you asserting that SOE reserves no right to approve
or deny that fundamental change?

And Darktyger, if you're going to continue in this discussion, please learn
about the issues involved, rather than a simple minded blanket statement
that you repeat after having read it somewhere.  This is a discussion group,
and your proclamations don't do much for the discussion.
