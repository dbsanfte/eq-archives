I think I saw something like it before. If I'd make a guess I'd say it's
something from en EP or Time god. They have very nice looking particle
weapons in their lootlists.

I really like that monk 2hb with all the runes floating off. Too bad most
time geared people are either raiding time, raiding LDoN or alting. Never
many ubers around in PoK these days.
