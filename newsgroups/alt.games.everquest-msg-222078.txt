We are talking about slowed LDoN mobs here, not 500 quad hitters in PoV.  
If the mob is running around, it's because someone is not where they 
should be, and the mob was not rooted.  Second thing is, don't rez the 
enchanter, the enchanter should zone back in (he is bound nearby, right?) 
loot most of his corpse, and keep on trucking.  Rez after the adventure 
is done.  Third thing is, I have yet to lose a single enchanter doing 
this in LDoN.  The only adventure I have completely failed, not even 
partial points on it, was the one where the warrior insisted on doing his 
"job" as you put it.
