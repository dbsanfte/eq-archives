Hello,

I'm planning my first character on a fresh new server.

I will either be an SK or a monk,
I know that the SK has much better AC and much more health while the
monk can do much more damage.
The qestion is if we put an SK or a monk against a melee mob, assume
they are on the level and similarly equipped, aand the SK doesn't cast
any spells,  Who is more likely to defeat the mob?

Also between above classes, who will be a better parnter to a shaman?


Thanks for help....
