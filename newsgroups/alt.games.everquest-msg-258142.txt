No, there's no official source listing quests which are working in the 
game and ones that aren't.

As far as I know, there's no unofficial source doing this either; close 
as you can get is what you've already tried; reading up on the various 
boards and looking for reports from people who have completed it.

At one point, several years ago, I saw a post supposedly from one of the 
Devs saying that only 50% of the quests in the game had been solved.

Some quests that have been solved have been found to be using a 
misspelled trigger word, wrong "go to next" person, and other things 
botched by the writers; others simply took forever for someone to figure 
out what the item being described was, or figuring out the obscure trade 
skill recipee to make a step.

Others actually ask for the wrong item; for a recent example, the 
berserker epic apparantly asks for a spider venom sack of some kind (I'm 
not to this stage yet so can't confirm that), but instead wants a scent 
gland off a named skunk in Tox forest.  Apparantly this was solved 
because someone noticed a new mob appearing in Tox, and desperately 
trying combining things in the quest bag, dropped his item in there just 
in case that was needed instead of the venom sack.

Since errors like that with older quests don't have the benefit of there 
only being half a dozen new mobs added to the game, its much harder to 
figure out what wrong item or items is/are being missed for them...

My suggestion is to actually ask, here and in other forums, about the 
quest you are trying to solve, particularly in places where someone has 
claimed it -is- solvable.  If you don't want a solution, ask if there 
are any errors in the solution, otherwise all you need is that yes/no 
answer... and it looks to me as though you already have it but just 
don't find the source credible.
