  Hmmmm, yes I know this effect.  It's happened to me before in
lag situations.  The relocation I experienced doesn't seem to be related
to lag or movement -- twice it happened while I was sitting perfectly
still and meditating.  Once it killed me with a 10000-point fall,
another time no damage, I just found myself in a completely
different place than I sat down at.

  I am trying to gather reports from those that this has happened to
and find something in common about configuration or events that
happen when it occurs.  It is hard to track down bugs that are so
hard to reproduce.
