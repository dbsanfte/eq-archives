In article <3D8AFD3C.FF7ECAA4@dejazzd.com>, emporer@dejazzd.com says...

Any class:

Telling the other class it's job isn't important enough to worry about.

There's nothing funner than trying to edge around to the back of a mob, 
clinging for dear life to the very high cliff over a bubbling pool of 
lava.  Then after the fight is over reminding the group politely that 
you need to be in the back to do damage, please pull back a bit more, 
and getting "well you're just going to have to do damage from the front 
today."
