Tanqueray is the best gin IMO, and Tanqueray Ten even more so.  Bombay
Sapphire comes in just under standard Gordons.  Unfortunately
Tanqueray Ten is pretty much unheard of here in the UK, and I have to
buy it on my occasional visits to the US.  As my main drink is proper
tequila (ie 100% blue agave), also difficult to get here, I usually
end up declaring about 6 bottles on my return.  So far I haven't had
to pay a penny in duty, though.  :)
