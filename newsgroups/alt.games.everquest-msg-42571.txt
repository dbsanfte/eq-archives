There are people who play this game that arent power gamers, people that
hunt for what they own, not people that farm and sell.  My level 54 cleric
has never charged for a res, and only once or twice has taken a donation for
one.  He still wears a BS tunic for a chest piece and has about 5k in the
bank.  My level 51 warrior is still pretty much in crafted and has about 1k
in the bank.  I for one am glad they made them affordable.  I dont really
give a crap if every level one twink has one or not, they arent paying for
my play time.

BTW I am sure you could make the same assumption regarding speed now.  Just
assume everyone has SoW spell or potion or JBoots.
