I go to stonebrunt, 10 people in zone. I /shout L25 enchanter LFG, no 
reply. I wait several minutes, repeat, do another /who, 7 people in 
zone, /shout lfg again, no reply. I repeat this over and over, for 
several days, and all I get is the occasional "can I have breeze?" from 
the mainly druids and necros soloing there.
Wasted 4 days there and got totally fed up with begging solo-ers.
Verant should make a zone exclusively for soloing druids and necros, 
preferably one where you can never leave once you enter.
