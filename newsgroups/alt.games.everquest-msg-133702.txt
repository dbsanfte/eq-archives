}Probably not, if I understand the gist correctly.  My problem is, all the
}books that I can get are too dumbed down to get as deep as I want.  Sure,
}they'll show you the chain rule, and they'll show you how to find a
}derivative using it, but they don't prove to you that the chain rule is
}true.  I guess I broke my "I believe" button back in Power School. 

Ahh yep, think you're right, it wouldn't do the trick.  I've noticed that 
trend in a lot of math books myself, and I have a suspicion about it.  In 
many math classes I took, most of the formulae ended up being proven in 
class.  In fact, proving the formulae was pretty much the majority of the 
lecture.  So I think they figured they didn't need to put that in the 
book, so then the teacher would have something to do.  So perhaps if you 
can locate a Teacher's Guide edition...

Your other approach is this:  Assume all the proofs are left as an 
exercise for the reader.  There's no better way, really, to get a deep 
understanding of this stuff than to try to prove it to yourself.  But that 
can be really bloody hard.

My all-time most hated math book quote:  "The proof is left as an exercise 
for the reader".  Ngngngngngnnn...

}I'm
}actually thinking that the best book for me would be one of those stuffy old
}college texts that modern academia shuns for being too "uninspiring."  I
}guess that's the difference between studying to maintain NCAA eligiblity,
}and studying to learn something.

Hm, another place I see a lot of the stuff proven is in math books written 
by a particular style of math professor...  The ones who lecture from 
books they wrote for the course, and whose lectures consist of slowly 
transcribing their book onto the board.  (Zzzzz.)  Actually, we may be 
talking about exactly the same books here. :)  What's NCAA? National 
Collegiate Athletics Association? National Clinical Assessment Authority?

}And there's another potential topic for discussion.... the student's role in
}their failure to learn.

Oh, let's not go there.  Speaking as an occasional TA, it would only make 
me angry.

(This is a third-year course!! You don't study, you don't come to office 
hours or lectures, you never read or even bought the book, and you're 
somehow -suprised- that you got 8/100 on the final? *tears out hair*)
