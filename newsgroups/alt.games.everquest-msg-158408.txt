Disney to launch online multiplayer game 
 




By GARY GENTILE, AP Business Writer 


LOS ANGELES (October 26, 12:53 p.m. PDT) - Disney is taking a small
step into the world of multiplayer online games, a genre that has
proved both popular and profitable for other companies.

The Internet division of The Walt Disney Co. has begun testing of a
three-dimensional online game called "Toontown."

It will offer an alternative to such games such as "Everquest" and
"Ultima Online", which have attracted hundreds of thousands of paying
adult players and provide role-playing experiences in real time.

The Disney game pits cartoon avatars against a race of evil robots,
called "Cogs," who are out to take the fun out of Toontown. The robots
replace Toontown's colorful buildings with drab skyscrapers and attack
players with such corporate weapons as bounced checks and red tape.

Players defeat the Cogs by throwing pies, squirting seltzer water and
using other gags. More points are earned when players work together.

Disney will charge $5.95 per month with an initial sign-up fee of
$9.95, which covers the first 30 days during the testing period.
People will be able to play one week for free before having to pay.

The game features instant-messaging technology. Young players must
obtain parental permission and can chat only with approved friends who
receive a time-sensitive activation code.
