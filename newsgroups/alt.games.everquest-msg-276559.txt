Loral's Evil Agenda of Spring 2005

by Loral on March 17, 2005

The recent release of Dragons of Norrath makes this the perfect time
for a new Evil Agenda. Dragons changed Everquest a lot. We talked about
what we liked. We talked about what needed improvement. Now is a good
time to talk about what we want in the future. Like previous evil
agendas, I will focus on five areas of the game I feel need
improvement.

1. Improve the variety of single-group events, encounters, and
monsters.

The mission system in Dragons show us what a wide variety of encounters
a single group can be given to accomplish within 90 minutes. Improve
single-group boss mobs to tap into the creative work used currently for
raids. Make single-group boss and named NPCs more interesting than
typical mob encounters. Continue to focus on creating new and
interesting single-group missions. Add missions that take players to
Norrath's old zones.

2. Add new quests, tasks, missions, and mission vendors for levels 10
to 50.

Add missions for each old-world dungeon with a focus on exploration and
lore. Offer a new low and mid-level mission vendor with appropriate
rewards for these missions. Show new players the strength of the new
quest and mission system. Add tasks that focus on exploration and
discovery at lower levels. Add in new progressive low-level quests
using the new quest journal. Make quests alignment / archetype based
instead of race / class to open up each quest to a wider audience.

3. Add a tiered mission vendor loot system.

As players progress through missions and single group encounters,
unlock new sets of more powerful equipement on mission vendors. This
offers further progression for single group hunters and helps raiders
gear up new recruits without having to defeat older content. The
difficulty of the encounters helps ensure that players earn equipment
they deserve. Ensure that all players have methods to progress through
single group item rewards.

4. Continue to improve the Plane of Knowledge.

The Plane of Knowledge is a natural gathering point for players. It is
not uncommmon to find hundreds of players within its walls. New players
should become aware of its strengths earlier. Add tasks to take new
players from their home city to the Plane of Knowledge. Add a level 20
quest for a high casting time, high recast cost recall to Knowledge
item to allow all players a quick way to safety when real life requires
attention. Rebuild the Plane of Knowledge using the latest features of
the New Graphics Engine to show all players how far the look of the
game has improved.

5. Improve player communication and group options.

Improve the friends window to allow notes and track the last played
date. Allow group member invites from across zones and directly from
the LFG channel. "/invite soandso" should invite a user no matter where
they are. Add "find PC" as a basic feature of the "find" command. Add
players to the "Find" window when activated. Add an email indicator
hotbutton to the default hotbox. Add a "new email" text alert. Add more
hotboxes to each hotbox page. Add a default "new player" chat channel
and autosubscribe new players to this chat so veterans can help out.
Add an EQ2 style mentor system to Everquest.
Conclusion

The release of Dragons of Norrath shows a strong new direction for
Everquest. The above recommendations will continue to help strengthen
Everquest into a wide and entertaining game for years to come.
