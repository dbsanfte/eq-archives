As others have written, the main flaw in your calculations is that the
damage bonus for a two-handed weapon is taken from a different table
than that for one-handed weapons.  Lucy has one such table:

http://lucy.allakhazam.com/dmgbonus.html

If your one-handed damage bonus is 2, then a 2-handed weapon with delay
36 would have a bonus of 3.  Lucy's table goes all the way up to level
65, with a 1-h bonus of +13 and a 2-h bonus at delay 36 of +39.  Note
that the damage bonus for a 2-h weapon does depend on the delay,
whereas this is not true for 1-h weapons.

Finally, the figure of merit is generally taken as:
(2*damage+bonus)/delay

- Prelgor

p.s.  I take everything above back!  I will leave it unedited, for
educational purposes.  I just looked up the staff, and it's also a
one-handed blunt!  From the large delay, I had just assumed it was a
2-h weapon.

For pure DPS, just use (2*damage+bonus)/delay.  Eventually, the mace
will indeed become better than the staff.  Of course, it's hard to put
a value on the snare proc from the mace, especially if you are class
that cannot otherwise snare...  If you wield it in the off-hand (which
would cut the proc rate in half), I might still use the mace anyway,
just to get a faster rate of dual wield skillups, if you're still
behind the curve on that.
