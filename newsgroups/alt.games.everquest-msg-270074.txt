Nothing that in that rumor I relayed would contradict that; the fact 
that all there is left to do is things that are PvP based doesn't mean 
that they necessarily allow people to attack each other without 
permission.  Just means you can either sit around trying to think of 
words that rhyme with month or go spoiling for a PvP fight of some kind.

EQ1's endgame wasn't tied to PvP, in fact there was never any benefit to 
PvP on non PvP servers; you never gained experience or got any loot off 
your foes or raised any skills.  EQ1 instead pinned its star to never 
having an endgame; every time people started to top out in terms of 
level plus gear (and later, plus AA), they'd introduce new content to 
raise the bar, which is why we now have 20 extra levels, plus a huge 
amount of possible AA, plus gear so good that the stuff people throw 
away because they got handmedowns from people who got handmedowns from 
people is so good that it puts any item from the original release of the 
game to shame.
