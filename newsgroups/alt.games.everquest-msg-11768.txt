Along those lines....

I'm seeing so many guilds with "of" and "of the" in their names, that the
names seem to be lacking in creativity anymore.

These days, something like <Mercenaries of Highpass> might look better as
<Highpass Mercenaries> or <McCabe's Commandoes> or <Highpass Foreign Legion>
for example.
(BTW, I know of no guild known as Mercenaries of Highpass, I'm just using it
as an imaginary example.)
