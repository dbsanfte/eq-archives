Hey all,

I just tried to make EQIM work(reinstall), and had some success (hey look 
at that, I can add friends with copy and paste from Character_##.ini into 
the .xml files, wheeee). But, the damn thing crashes or gets disconnected 
constantly. This sucks, a lot, as I was hoping to use it to get lots of 
tells regarding my Eejag raid tomorrow.

Anyone have any clues for me?
