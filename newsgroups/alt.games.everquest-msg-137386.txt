I played just fine with a 24k modem connection.  The reason I finally
switched to broadband was because it was cheaper.  With dialup, I needed to
have 2 dialup accounts, and a second phone line.  With my wireless
broadband, I have one account with extra email, and only one phone line.
Net savings of about $10 a month for a much better connection.
