I can certainly say it's not dead on Karana.  

Not too long ago (maybe 3 weeks) I hit level 55 with my ranger.  Woohoo!  
Time to head to PoG and get my Helm of the Tracker.  Stop by the bank to 
pick up the quest pieces I've been keeping in there since I got 'em when 
I was lvl 52 or so, and they're gone.  WTF?!  /petition Yeah, I had all 
the pieces for helm of the tracker and now I don't.  (reminds me of the 
gucomic where the guy petitions to get his epic back on stormhammer, but 
I can't find the link.)  30 minutes or so later I get a tell from the 
guide (the guides on Karana are all really nice btw) saying they need to 
know the exact item names and that they're going to escalate it to a GM-
Admin.  About an hour after that as my guild is porting into PoSky and 
we're just about to start killing pixies, A_GM_Admin01 tells you, 'Hi, 
A_GM_Admin01 here, it looks like you deleted those items back in 
January.'  
You tell AGMA01, 'fuxx0r.'  
AMGA01 tells you, 'It looks like you were deleting a lot of kromriff 
heads at the time.'  
You tell AGMA01, 'fuxx0r.'  
AGMA01 tells you, 'I've re-created the heads and will come give them to 
you.'  
You tell AGMA01, 'U r the rulest!'
AGMA01 has offered you A smashed protector of zek's head.
...

That's not actually verbatim ;)

Another time I was stuck in TD with no clue where I was and with a red 
con ogre scowling at me and I got summoned to the docks.  That was my 
first CS experience ;)

Or the time when I got stuck in a wall in Uguk near the skeletal monk and 
fell through the world for 20k and got a corpse summons and a CSRez.

In fact the *worst* CS experience I've had was when Yaelchekr, a lvl 1 
rogue of Brell was in checking for Master Yael in the whole and a GM 
asked me to drag some poor bastard's corpse who had just fallen in to the 
hole.  Then they refused to SoW me and told me burned woods is past WToV 
this week.  And I didn't even get a cool surname like "The UberAssling" 
or anything out of it.  WTF?!
