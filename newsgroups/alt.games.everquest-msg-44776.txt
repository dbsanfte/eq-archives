Funny you should mention rogues in particular.  In EQ most rogue skills
weren't even implemented at release.  The rogues had the sense traps and
disarm traps skill the day of release, but there weren't any traps in the
game until the release of Kunark.  The make poison and apply poison skills
were listed in the rogues skill list, but they didn't do anything for more
than a year.  Evade wasn't added until around the two year mark.  The sneak
and hide skills didn't work together for more than a year (before that there
was no message of success or failure for the rogue and moving made you
visible regardless of sneak, just like any other class that gets sneak
and/or hide).

I don't know if DAoC will be a worthwhile game or not, but if they've added
the rogue skills *before* release then they are at least a year ahead of
where Verant was.

Best Regards
