Nonsense, warriors solo perfectly adequately as long as they select 
targets which can be killed in less than 50% of their HP, and have an 
endless supply of bandages.  Kill mob, bandage back up to 50%, 
repeat.    No waiting for someone to get mana back, no splitting the exp 
with a partner... it really isn't as bad as all that.

Now its true that with a healer comes buffs and the ability to go after 
bigger prey and crowd control (all healers have Root) and so forth, a 
warrior will almost certainly get more exp per hour with a partner or 
group than solo... but saying they do -not- solo is silly.  There are 
times when no group presents itself, sitting on the sidelines because 
you don't know how to solo is as much a waste of your time as soloing 
when there's a good group out there looking for a tank.
