That really does seem odd. Maybe I'm nuts, but if *I* was one of the
contestants in a BotB contest, I'd want spectators. Imagine a
heavy-weight boxing championship with no audience. Sort of defeats the
purpose.

What I'd *like* to think they mean by this is that spectators will be
allowed in the Arena zone, but not within the PvP area. But no amount
of stretching my imagination can make it work that way.

I've only played an enchanter through low levels - can anyone come up
with a reason that an Enchanter BotB contest shouldn't have
spectators?
