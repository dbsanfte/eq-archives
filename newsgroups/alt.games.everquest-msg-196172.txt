use the AE memblur (blanket of forgetmenots.. er foregetfulness)
works especially well if it's not an auto-agro critter. At any rate it won't
re-agro on the pet.

mem blur mem blur mem blur. piss it off, root it, let pet shish kabob it,
then blanket of forgetfulness at 10%, will blur the monster and back off
pet. (because it gets blurred too).

then let the rogue go to town.
