I went to Kael and found 2 groups hanging at the zone line fighting
together.  I just hung around and fired off a level 1 spell after they had
done enough damage I was sure that I would not mess things up by pulling the
mob.  No-one minded.  After awhile I was invited in to one of the groups and
I found out that that whole group was only getting faction and the other
group was getting xp.  Fine by me.  I fought with them for a few hours and
got my cov up to where I could buy in SS.  We made our way almost to the
arena before I had to log, and I actually had the experience of being
summoned.  lol.  Me a lowly 44 wiz.  I did get resists, but I hit
surprisingly often.
