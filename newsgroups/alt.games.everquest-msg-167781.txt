There is a guy named Mojax fishing by the lake in west commons.
Go buy a lot of milk, at least 40 bottles, I gave him maybe 70 or so
Give milk to him and you will get faction _extremely_ fast,
Only thing you have to remember is another NPC will run by and insult Mojax
when you give him milk and he will run away so keep hailing him so he stays
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=361
PS quest also lowers faction with guards in Freeport so I bought orc picks
that had been sold to vendors around Freeport/commons to give one of to the
guards at the toll booth nearest Freeport, he wants 4 at a time, I had fine
faction before that so it wasn't necessary
Learn to use www.allakhazam.com and you will almost never have to use this
group to get answers on factions and quests, you will find the info there
much faster
