I have found that in some cases it does.  My guess is that rental companies
such as Blockbuster (well, hell, MGM owns them so..) and Hollywood Video
(the two "biggies" on the East Coast atleast) are probably allowed to place
up to 10 or 15 minutes (I think I have found the maximum number of minutes
for previews was either 10 or 15) of advertisement.  The indendent rental
companies are probably responsible to choose/accept whom they are going to
advertise for and what they are going to advertise.. though they probably
then in turn have to pay a franchise type fee for just those previews/ad's
to the producing (or whatever) company that released the video/movie.

Dunno.  I honestly haven't a clue how these movie rental joints operate,
but, thats just a wild assed guess. ;p

When I am situated with this move, which is taking FAR longer than I want it
to.. damnit, I want to get outta this no TV, no DVD, no VCR, no microwave,
etc house of mine and move to the new one... :) I  grabbed some non-oven
type "hungry man" type meals from the grocery store just two nights ago
(after I had my microwave moved) which once I got home realized that was a
moronic thing to do.... since.. I dont have a microwave any longer..  its on
its way to Florida. <grin>

Anyway, what I meant to say in the above paragraph is that I am interested
in seeing it just as much as I am copying/capturing it for all to see.
Though, I have to get on the ball here with cleanup and such before any of
that capturing will take place.
