When I have more time I'll come back and respond to other
thoughts in this post, but I think you've left something major
out of your examination of what "balanced" means.

Solo ability.

All classes can solo, but at wildly different levels of
efficiency.

Bards, for example, can tackle groups of 10+ mobs at a time,
deliberately, doing DPS that will break the scale if you could
ever get a look at it

Rogues, on the other hand, lose almost all their DPS advantage
and have to go after only the wimpiest lightest prey, one at a
time.

If a class is a great soloer, the fact that its relatively low on
the totem pole for groups or for raids might be compensated for
when looking at how balanced it is.  Coo

Funny things happen, though; for example, SOE radically changed
the group bonus system a while back; suddenly the degree to which
solo ability factored in to the equation changed; so you have to
be ready for the whole deck to be changed under your feet at any
time.

The same is true when you consider what techniques are currently
in vogue; once upon a time, Fear Kiting was all the rage.  If you
snare a mob and fear it, then ability to soak damage or heal
damage isn't very important, whats important is DPS and the key
abilities to snare and fear.  At another time, mezzing was the
king; making several mobs just stand there while you kill their
buddies one at a time was just fantastic.  Then there was the day
of the FD puller; bringing in just one mob at a time; people no
longer are willing to wait for such niceties now, pacify pulling
and the return of the mez split seem to be popular.

Mudflation is another factor.  Once, melee ruled the world.  Then
focus items FT items and the like caused the rise of Caster
damage.  But now, as the caster situation remains relatively
stable, higher ratio melee items and better hastes are building
melee back into the kings of damage over time.

Trying to tune balance to hit a moving target like this, though,
well thats a thankless task.
