 Yes, because non-civilians are well aware of the risks they take. 
Civilians have no idea they are in danger.

True, why don't we just go bomb Cuba. Might have been the Cubans. Hmm 
maybe it was the Norweigens.. or the Irish... or the Russians. How about 
we find out WHO before we go shooting off the guns? Don't get me wrong, 
I'm all for retaliation and publicly executing the person(s) 
responsible, but I'd kinda flinch about having thousands of innocent 
casualties on my conscience. Personally, I'd like the US government to 
put a billion on Bin Laudin's head.. get him here nice and safe and THEN 
hold a public trial and execute him.

Really? You know for a fact their personal motivations? So EVERY country 
in the Middle East is controlled by a "sack of human waste"? I don't 
think so... I also don't think any country in the Middle East has 
declared war on the United States of America. Personally, I'd love to 
see a Delta team sent to Afghanistan and capture Bin Laudin and bring 
him back for trial and execution. The only sad thing is there's probably 
hundreds more there ready to take his place.
