I finally got this discipline last night. Yes, I know warriors get
better ones later on, but I have to tell ya...... I was smiling from ear
to ear when I finally tried it. We were fighting crystalline wurms in GD
in the caves at the time trying to pick up some drop spells, and
suddenly "ding!". 

On the next pull after my disc recycled twice, (You don't want to know
why twice) I had it loaded up and the cleric let me sink REALLY low into
bezerker frenzy mode before beginning to cast a CHeal. (The wurms don't
hit that hard, so it wasn't an issue. I had switched out from my normal
dual one handers to my Mithryl Skullsplitter just for this attack.

Had haste on me anyway. I never saw a set of crippling blows like that
before in my life. Double attack was firing, every swing hit, and every
one of them was a crippling blow. A few were gimpy but most were in the
200's and 300's. I think I took about a quarter of the wurm's HP during
that one burn.

No, I don't have a question. I just wanted to say that, if you're a
warrior, you're really going to like making 54.
