/petition JACKASS Crakpipesmoker  Appears to be a naming violation of
the rule regarding offensive language and modern terms.  Thank you

/guide so and so here, how can I help you.  

/r I petitioned Jackass crakpipesmoker,  I believe its a naming
violation.

/guide Oh, I guess you did. Yes, it is,  One of the GMs will take care
of it.

OK, I have tremendous admiration for someone who goes to the trouble of
learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
