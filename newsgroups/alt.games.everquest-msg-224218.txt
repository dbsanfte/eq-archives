(I don't mean this in any sort of bad/flame sort of a way, but....)

Being completely new to role playing of any sort, I'm not sure what is
"weirder" -- referring to your character in the third person, as if they
actually exist, or using first person to talk about what you do in the game,
as if *you* are really killing stuff, etc.  This post made me think about
it, and now both seem very odd!
