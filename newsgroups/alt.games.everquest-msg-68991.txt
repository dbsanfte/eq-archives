Lately, all ppl have been talking about is how much SoL sux, which is
understandable since many people have yet to get it to work. So my question
is to those out there who either have uber-systems, or are just lucky, and
have everything to work.

How is the Beastlord class? I like the whole idea of a partner in crime that
is an ability, rather than a spell, that sticks with you through zones and
such. Besides, they look pretty cool. How is the pet's damage, and how are
the buffs? What race is best for the class? Also, how does the class rank
against other classes? Finally, is the Beastlord fun to play?

Second set of questions, how are the Kitties? What class is best suited for
them? Do they have infravision? Again, are they fun?

Guess thats all. Kinda long, but I am sure there have to be some positives
to Luclin!
