Okay, so I played a mage to 30 on FV, then deleted him and created
a druid.  Now I've got the itch to play a mage again.

So I started a mage on a different server and completed all my
newbie armor quests by level 8.

Quests are wonderful.  They make the exp'ing seem a lot less tedious
since you're working towards something besides _just_ exp.

So then I fell back into the exp treadmill and I realized things
were feeling tedious again.  So my question for the group is, what
kind of interesting quests can a level 8-11 mage do?  Some items
not covered by the newbie armor quests were primary, secondary,
range, shoulders (though this is covered with a summon spell),
neck (ditto - summon spell), and waist.  I may be missing something
else but I think that covers it.

I'd love to go on quests to fill in those empty spots.  I'm not
real interested in extremely tedious quests (wait until midnight,
sacrifice a chicken, howl at the moon, hop up and down four times,
and then MAYBE your mob will pop which MAYBE will drop the rare
item you need).

I'm more interested in quests that keep you active hunting down
multiple items to combine or turn-in for your reward, all of them
being reasonable to obtain (translation: no long camps or annoying
involved processes to get mob X to spawn in the first place).

Can anyone help me out with this?  Unfortunately magecompendium.com
seems to have mostly been disassembled and is only a shell of its
former self.  That's the first place I went looking for good mage
quests (though it doesn't *have* to be mage only).  But most of the
good stuff is just gone.

Anyway...this mage hopes to continue his questing!  Thanks in
advance for any guidance!

-Ed
