I never thought I'd have a character high enough to consider
putting points into Alternate Advancement, but here I am with
my 55 Necromancer about to ding my first AA point.

Innate Run Speed seems to be the obvious ability in which to
put the first few points.

But I'd like to know how fast it really is.

I read somewhere that each IRS point increases your base run
speed by 10%, which would mean that three points gives you
about 30%, which is the same as SOW cast by a level one
character, at least according to the Prima guide.  (Yes, I
know no class gets SOW at level one.)

Permanent SOW that works indoors and doesn't need to be
activated sounds very nice, even if it's only a level one
SOW.

Does anyone know if the 10% figure is correct?

Thanks!
