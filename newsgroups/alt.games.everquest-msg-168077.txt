Ooooh, now there's a memorable quest experience...

"It was cool man, Dagar and I headed out with a couple lawn chairs
and a case of beer to watch this dr00d.  Just about the time I was
thinkin we shoulda brought another case with us the dr00d yells 'Yo!
d00dz!'.  So I headed over to this pile of kinda scorched lookin
pile o' gobbie bones and there it was, just like he said.  So then
we went back to town and downed that second case."
