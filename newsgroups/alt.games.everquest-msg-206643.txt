One of the numerous times E'ci was down,  I started a DE enchanter on a
different server.

Fear kiting is definately the way to go.

Gear on the character other then cloth was bear hide boots from the Millers,
gold stud from Cubert quest, and a Polished Bone Hoop from a vendor. These
are focus items for under 20 and perfect for a chanter. Did the SK fish mule
thing and got a Band of Rodcet Nife and Stein of Moggok. Everything else is
like cloth, cracked staff, that kind of junk.

Least down time in my experience was to start them off with a good debuff.
After they hit you once, back out and let the pet tank. Didn't really make a
difference which order 2nd wave gets put in, [DOT, DD, Stun], then tag them
with Fear. Sometime you have to apply Fear a few times but if everything
goes right you and your pet should not take much damage.
