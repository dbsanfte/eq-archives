I do that, *or* put my least valuable on my most valuable.  Say I win a +5
sv fire...  That's not a major thing, but it's handy.  I might put it on my
Elysian BP for now, since I won't have qualms about replacing it when I get
a +6 wisdom one down the road.

Not to mention group to group.  If you go in with no robe-wearing casters or
SK's, those INT ones get pretty darn unimportant.  At least on Tunare, STA
seems to be the most underrated one.
