Well it might have been if they'd restricted the font changes to the
chat windows. As it is it's an ugly mess on all the other parts of the
UI, especially as the new fonts seem to ignore the <font> size
specifications in the xml files at the moment. Maybe this is only a
problem in custom ui's that add extra information and use the <font>
size in the xml. Mine has a list of resists in my group window as well
as small fonts for the percentage of mana and health for group members
and changing to any other font makes every bit of text in my UI exactly
the same size.
