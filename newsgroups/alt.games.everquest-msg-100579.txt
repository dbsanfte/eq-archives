You are trying to sound economicaly sound but are failing. Whenever there is
a chance for profit above the norm new people continue to enter the market
untill that chance has sunk down to the enviromental norm.

The only times this does not happen is when artificial outside influences
make it significantly harder or impossible to enter the market. California`s
power crisis was predicted by many economists, and will be a future textbook
example of what happens when artificial restraints are put on a free market
economy. In this case price caps on what power companies could charge, and
outside forces making it impossible to build new plants caused a shortage .
