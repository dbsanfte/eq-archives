Actually that would just totally limit a free trade economy while
people would still twink to their hearts content, it would just be a
little harder to set the twinking up.

To see this in action, group in icewell keep at fairly high level
killing the dwarves who drop excellent armor sometime. Everyone in
your group will have twinks logged out there to loot the no drop armor
;)

The way to partially eliminate twinking is of course the way its been
done in muds since the 1980's (and perhaps earlier):

"that item is too powerful for you to wear"

there, problem solved. I always thought it was funny that games like
EQ took so much from muds (EQ took the diku mud emotes verbatim for
example) in basic design and such yet forgot about the mud things like
that which have been proved to work very well over time. Brad McQuaid
et al. always said they did not want to do that because it might be
possible for X level of player to be in a group legitimately and
actually get X level of item and not be able to wear it. That was kind
of a copout since the muds had already solved that problem also by
giving a pretty wide safety range on who could wear the item. 

Anarchy online, which I've often thought is really a pretty poor game,
handles the problem quite well with a twist on the "too powerful for
you to wear" thing. You need certain minimal stats in several areas to
wear armor and the higher level the armor (quality level) the higher
those stats need to be. So you might be level 32 and be able to wear
quality 38 armor with some stat implants and such.. but it won't go
much beyond that. They already fixed one way in which you could wear
armor that was quite a bit beyond your range also. Because of this
stat thing in AO you see people auctioning armor A LOT since there is
just so much armor that a person will get or outgrow which they will
then sell to lower level people who can make the stats.
