Tough choice.  I've played a shaman & a druid so here's my 2 copper.

Race affects the choice.  If she plays a night-blind race, I'd go with
a shaman.  Shaman get the infravision spell fairly early (level 9 as I
recall) & it makes a big difference in many dungeons.  The shaman has
a better STR buff than a similar level druid.  Shaman can also buff
almost every other stat for the party & has more debuffs for the mob.

Many of the ranger self-buffs are also shaman buffs (e.g. Feet Like a
Cat), but often the shaman gets it sooner.  Two areas lacking for a
shaman are damage shields and Snare.  A ranger can cast a damage
shield and snare, so I would choose a shaman over a druid to partner
with a ranger.  The attack spells are very complimentary.  SoW on the
party, multiple DoTs from the shaman, snare from the ranger, shaman
debuffs mob attack speed and her biggest problem will be when to use
her bow.  Although both a ranger & a shaman can wear chain, let the
ranger tank when the mob finally gets close since a ranger will have
at least a self-buff damage shield.  

If she chooses a paladin that has night vision, I'd go with a druid.
Damage shields & later porting to the hunting area are very nice nice.
A paladin can wear heavier armor than a ranger, so the healer partner
can be lighter armored.  Shaman is still a good choice with a paladin,
but I don't recall paladins having either damage shield or snare.
Druids fill that gap nicely.   

Loot wise -- with the ranger/shaman combo or with the paladin/shaman
combo, you may be tempted to argue over who gets the ringmail or +3
WIS belt you just looted since you both can wear it.  The simple
answer is the tank always gets the best AC armor first and the
shaman/druid gets the better +WIS items first.
