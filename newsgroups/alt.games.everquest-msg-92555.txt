Yah biz there is a good map at eqatlas that shows the bank now.
There are lots of vendors there.

This City reminds me of Erudin. Beautiful, cool architecture, great
textures and as Jeff said totally empty. To answer Jeff the reason
the city is empty is the same reason most cities are empty. There
is nothing to do in them. If you want to hunt most city npcs are hard to
kill, and usually drop crap loot. So no one will hunt them for long.

What kills me is that there is only like 9 quests in this whole huge city!
This is by far the biggest city in the game bar none. Only zone that
might be bigger is Skyshrine. I hope they have this city slotted for more
expansion.

The arena is amazing but don't go in there unless you have a monster
computer and even then you will lag I think. The reason is that the arena
is full of Seru citizens, hundreds of them.

This city is Definitely a must see site in EQ. But I agree with Jeff it seems
a shame that so much work went into the city and most people will walk through
it once and go "gee that's cool" and then never set foot in it again.
