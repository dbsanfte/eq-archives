The difficulty with this combo is the pathing... is it safe to fear what yer
hunting? Tarre (de necro) fought with Kytara (vs rogue) for a while, but it
always ended up in several deaths for the rogue, and none for the necro. We
spent more time on her CRs then we did fighting. This is level 26ish. We
tried gnolls (which have a better pathing for this), Stonebrunt, and a
couple other places.

Any duo can be worked out if it's what you love though. Mostly working with
a wizzie these days, and necro/wizzie is very unusual.
