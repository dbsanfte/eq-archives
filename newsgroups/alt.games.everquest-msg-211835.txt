With all due respect, Ed, that's a pretty limited view.

What about all of the true believers that do missionary work?  The church
that I used to attend annually makes mission trips to Brazil with
congretaion members who are health care workers, builders, and anyone else
who wants to go for two weeks and help out.  Other religions have missioanry
workers in deprived parts of the world.  Frankly, even when I attended
church on a regularly, I didn't have anything close to that sort of
committment.  IMO, it takes a special kind of individual to leave their
comfortable home and go to someplace like that to do that kind of work.

Regardless of the motive, be it philanthropic or evangilical, people who
desparately need assistance are helped by the type of 'true believer' I'm
referring to.
