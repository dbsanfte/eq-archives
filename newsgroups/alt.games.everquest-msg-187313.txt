Irrelevant to the discussion at hand. The name "Kahir" doesn't MEAN
anything racial or terrorist-related. It doesn't directly translate
into anything as far as I've found. From what you've said, it's a
Persian name. The fact that it was held by a person who's done bad
things is irrelevant. Or would you think someone named "Charles"
should have their name changed because of the resemblance to Charles
Manson.

It's one of those "context and intent" things. "Kyrmutz" on a froglok
is obviously intended to be a referrence to Kermit, the Muppet frog.
The same name on a Barbarian isn't so obvious as one, so it can
reasonably be allowed to slide. Reasonable doubt does apply on the
naming policy. Just like I could accept that the name "Zappa" on
anything but a Bard isn't intended as a referrence to Frank.

The fact that someone with your obvious attitude toward rules ever
taught at any school worries me... Someone who goes as far as you to
find loopholes and excuses not to enforce guidelines should not be
teaching children.
