I see many players with their name followed by a guild name. How does
one go about doing this? I'm not talking about the 20-lvl last name
thing, but the guild name in <> .
I am a wood elf ranger, joined the guild in Kelethin.
Now-how the heck do I get the guild name/order or whatever that is to
be a part of my name?

Question two-I also see characters with their name in purple. I
understand this implies a role play status. How does one set that up?

Thx all for the time and aid
