I have a theory along these line about why TCC the new expansion full of new
nwebie zones...

Give the kitties a head start.  With TCC, they can put some truely uber
items in the kitty newbie zones, and not worry a wit that they'll be farmed
by the higher level guys (like me) who learn of a new plus resists/int hands
item... which have been utterly lacking from every other zone in the game.

Now this will get some disproportionately good equipment in the hands of
brand new race and class really quickly... and it WILL cause resentment
amongst some higher level characters who don't want to start a beastmaster.

Basically it's like VI twinking the new cats.  Much like they did the snake
heads when kunark came out.  After a week or two when there's a couple of
level 60 cats per server, the loot will settle down some... of course the
TCC will still be in place, and already have caused all the resentment
(depending on how good that new lute is) it needs to.

Better ways to accomplish this?  (oh I don't know... kitty only items,
maybe?)

I figure with my luck the new wizard pet spells will be mob drop in new cat
zones... and probably in reverse order... the 39 will drop in a level 1-5
zone where TCC is designed to encourage cats to play their wizards until
they can actually use the spells... while the level 5 one will be placed on
Ragar Na'Halas the cat gawd of space combat in the Kilrah Prime zone...
requiring 75 guilds of not less than 100 people per to kill him, and a zone
cap of 6 players.

I've tought about TCC quite a bit since it was introduced... ultimately I do
not like it, because of the disparity in levels which many of MY quests
require... can you imagine doing the Coldain Shawl quest if bunnies wouldn't
drop meat for people to whom they are green? (to save you the thought... the
quest would then be litterally impossible).
