I wasn't trying to work out the actual effects of AC on combat, just trying
to work out how the figure out how the displayed AC value was calculated.  I
know that your Dodge skill and the difference in levels plays a part in
probablility of being hit, and the damage you take etc.  I wasn't going
there at all.

To paraphrase Dragnet: "Just the AC, maam".

I most certainly do not try to tank - I usually group with at least one monk
or warrior but if a beastie takes a liking to me my health does go down
fast.  I know I need some better gear - I'm still using AC6 imbued studded
boots :(

I have some decent armour / stat items (Tolan's Gauntlets, PSC, Hierophant's
cloak) but I but I need to get some of my Thurgadin quest armour to bring my
AC up to a decent level.
