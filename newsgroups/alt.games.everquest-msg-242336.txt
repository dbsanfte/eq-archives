Heh.  I'd be all for that, but knowing this newsgroup, I would consider 
such a flamewar inevitable, and could only hope it would be small.  
Congrats on kicking it off!

We agree here.

}As you have, by conflating the faq with the newsgroup persona of Taras
}Bulba.

/em is amazed his casting of Summon: Taras didn't fizzle. :)

I cold probably find something to criticize you for, but on the whole, I 
personally always enjoyed your presence here, even when we were at odds 
over something.  Not everyone felt the same way I do, of course.

}But if you have any criticism of the faq that I produced, then I am
}more than willing to answer. 

It's... out of date? :)  Again, it's a reach.  I always loved that FAQ.

}So, did you have anything specific in mind?

Naw.  Past history shows that most invocations of 'there should be a FAQ!' 
have led to small flamewars in your honor.  Now that that ritual is out of 
the way, we can get on with the construction of the new FAQ. :)
