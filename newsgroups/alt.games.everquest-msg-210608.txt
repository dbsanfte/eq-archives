Err, um yeah.  I did imply that a revamp would mean a nerf.   Just
habit due to long experience with SOE, I guess.

NOt saying they might make it better, more accessible to get the
Cleric BP that he's after, but it's also just as likely to remove that
BP entirely, or accidently remove one of the sub quests that it sounds
like you need to go through.

So yeah, I do adore the idea of a revamp, but I also think it may well
hose whatever is in there currently.  As SOE seems to be moving
towards this kind of limited-time content (Chardok B, pocket dungeons,
and LDoN, with scaleable threats), old zones are going to be changing
more and more.
