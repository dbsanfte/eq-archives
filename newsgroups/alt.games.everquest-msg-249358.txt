Unless they've changed it, the plan apparently is to implement inns.

(Leaving aside semantic bullshit of calling full exp for a mob a "bonus")
... After you have been out hunting for a time, your experince gain starts
to get a penalty.  50% exp gain per mob, then 25%, then less.  Over 8 hours
you would go from fully rested to fully exausted.  At full exaustion, you
would gain roughly 6% of the experience you would gain killing the same mob
while fully rested.

To return to rested state, your character must spend several hours of RL
time, online or offline, inside of an inn.
