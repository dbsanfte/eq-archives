Got a plate mold off a BOT tower named last night, went and
finished up the quest to make the BP.  Nice upgrade in stats and
HP and AC and even mana... but the clicky effect seems very wimpy
for a breastplate, to me.

Blessing of Reverence.

Thats a level 62 cleric buff, 300 mana gives about a 12.5% faster
casting time to its target on all spells with a cast time 3
seconds or higher (except of course for Complete Heal, the one
spell you really wish would cast faster)

Its not a terrible useless effect, I suppose, but it seems so
trivial for a breastplate.  Just me?

I suppose I'm looking at it wrong.  I won't have to unmem
something useful and mem BOR anymore.  300 mana per target over 8
or nine people in a raid should add up to significant savings.
Perhaps I'll cast BOR more than I have before now that its no
trouble and no mana cost... buff runs out far too fast for me to
keep up constantly in situations that aren't all that stressful..
but there are times when a faster casting chanter or shaman would
make all the difference.
