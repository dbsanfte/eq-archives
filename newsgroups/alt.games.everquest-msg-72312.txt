One of the harder quests?  Now that people couldn't care less about Venril
Sathir and the competition for him has ebbed off, Broken Golem-VS-Phinny
isn't much worse than a rogue's Renux-General-Phinny.  

From what I've seen, the wizards who don't have their epics by 55 are
generally the ones who simply aren't motivated enough by it to camp Phinny.
