They exist.  I have *one* in storage.  I don't hunt frogs, and I forget
whether I picked it off a corpse, or found it lying on the ground.  I'd give
it to you, but I'm on Xegony.  I also have most of a stack of Urticating
Hairs, which I'll probably sell.  Think my next poison's gonna be the one
using Putrid Bile.  Much easier to get, for me anyway.

(Advantage to not hunting Frogs - you can wander almost anywhere in UGuk and
lots of places in LGuk and never have a problem.  Makes it *much* safer if
you're hunting undead down there.)
