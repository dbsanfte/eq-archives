It can work when things go well.  Most of the enchanter DOTs do some 
initial direct damage, which can break root.  After that they are normal 
DOTs, and don't cause so much problem.  Of course if the mob is a caster it 
will still be able to cast on you and your pet will agro.  

You do have some techniques available to deal with this sort of thing.  You 
can call your pet off by either memory blurring it or casting a mesmerize 
spell on the mob (someone correct me if I'm wrong here).  If you are just 
starting out at level 1, it may be a while before you get those spells.  
Your pet may agro again right away but at least you have a chance of 
getting it out of there.  If all else fails you can unsummon your pet with 
the reclaim energy spell.  

Eventually you will be able to use charm to get a temporary pet you can 
command.  There are also AA abilities that let you command a summoned pet.  

Check around online for ideas if you haven't yet.  Guess I should toss in a 
couple links.
