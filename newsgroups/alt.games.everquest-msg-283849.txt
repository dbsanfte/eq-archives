Ducking is far superior to moving because it always works, and frees you up
instantly to cast another spell.  If you move, you have to wait until the
end of your normal cast time before it checks for interrupt.  Also, sometimes
moving won't actually interrupt the spell - you can channel through
small moves, or if you happen to have moved back to the exact /loc where
you started the spell, it won't interrupt.

The only time I move to interrupt a cast is if I'm on a mount, and it's not
critical to cast something else immediately.  If time is important (say,
partway through a nuke, and an add comes that should be mezzed), it's worth
typing /dism<enter>dd (which can't be used from a hotkey, unfortunately).  

Speaking of which, any caster who ever has mana problems should own a mount.
