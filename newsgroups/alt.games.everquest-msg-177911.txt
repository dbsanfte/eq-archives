This reminds me of how dumb ppl can be in KC (or any zone for that matter)!

I was in RCY and we where doing a great job with just the 5 of us, but we
wanted more dps, so we see some monk /ooc-ing he's looking for a CY group.
I do the right thing and /tell him to come to RCY.  He replies and says he
wants to camp the courtyard for the skeli-warlord who drops the T-Staff
(*ubah*).  I explain to him that we are camped just outside that and we can
pull him into RCY when he pops.  The monk says, "no" that we wants to camp
just the courtyard.

Now I have had my share of KC and have never once heard or seen anyone just
camping those 2 mobs just beyond the bridge before the LCY and RCY, not to
say it cant be dont, but c'mon just 2 mobs?  Not to mention that is the
end-all-be-all of train central when the shit hits the fan.

So I try to explain to this monk the CY is not really a camp, and that we
can get those mobs if he just comes to RCY (or LCY, or Live, or
whatever-else for that matter!).  He is insistant that he just wants a group
to camp those *2* mobs...LOL.  The whole time he keeps /ooc-ing he wants to
join a CY group...

/sigh
