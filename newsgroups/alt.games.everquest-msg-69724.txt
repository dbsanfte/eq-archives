I find them kind of ugly, because they are no longer balanced.  From
what I can see, it looks like they've got to much higher resolution
textures, but not really increased the polygon counts much.  This
makes the polygons in many areas stand out more.  Also, there are
places where they seem to have increased the texture resolution
substantially, but not the size, making tiling very apparent.

My review of SoL graphics so far:

1. Items.  Wow.  Some of the armor I've seen on people just looks
fantastic.

2. Character models.  Great textures on the faces, but many of the
models are misshapen (not enough polygons?).  My old Barbarian looked
like a cartoon human.  My new Barbarian looks like a live freak.

3. Landscape.  Tiling is apparent, and the polygons for the ground are
pretty large.
