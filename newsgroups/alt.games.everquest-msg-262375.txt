>I was just curious, how many people here are going to either switch to EQII? 

Switch to something, since I've already retired. EQ2 has a better
chargen, WoW has more interesting world elements, makes it hard to
decide between the two (if I play either). The deciding factor may be
that WoW appears to be almost impossible to twobox in, and I have no
idea how it is in EQ2, but I really want to twobox. Since both games
have cute gnomes, that factor is a tossup.
