Not sure who Ricky Martin is, but I think you'd have been safe with any of
the members of N-Sync (sp?). I believe one of them is named Timberlake.  Ok.
You've made me realize that my knowledge of male "heart throbs" is pitifully

For a frightening moment, I thought you meant the civil rights leader who
refused to sit at the back of the bus. But that's "Parks" I believe.
Anyway, that won't work for me. I want to be Miles Davis.
