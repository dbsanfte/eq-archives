Hi. I'm a lvl 11 Ranger. I don't know the answer to your first set of
questions but I would like to ask you who you talked to to start that quest
for the Scout sword.

I think the answer to your second question is to drink the beer. I
dunno...that sort of sounds like that's what he wants you to do.
Where is qeynos cpt tilly?
