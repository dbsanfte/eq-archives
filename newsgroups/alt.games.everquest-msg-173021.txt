On Cazic Thule there's a "rebreather" (face slot, I think) which gives
permanent EB and was selling for 2K. There's also an earring (can't
remember what it's called) that gives EB and was being sold at 3K or so.

I currently have about 1500 plat to my name and so have neither. :-)
(And the horse has priority... I'm finding out about sitting aggro in
the planes.)

Rather than blowing a mint on potions, you may want to save for a permanent
EB item, run the amulet quest in The Grey, then resell it in the bazaar at
your purchase price. Net loss: zero. Or else find a friendly mage to summon
a couple of stacks of water stones.
