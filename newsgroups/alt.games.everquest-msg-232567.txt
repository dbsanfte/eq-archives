Actually, the way that works is, the rich top up their SUVs, and the 
poor get to walk when the station owner runs out of petrol, and laughs 
all the way to the bank.

If it wasn't from you, I wouldn't believe I just read the paragraph 
above :-P If the owner were a (rare indeed) nice man, as you put it, he 
would simply pump half a gallon in everybody's tank, rich or poor.
