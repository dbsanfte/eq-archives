I used to be able to stay connected for weeks at a time, and looked forward
to coming back from holidays because my mule would have lots of money from
the sales. Now I can't seem to stay connected more than a few hours; i can
relog if i'm at the KB, but if I'm AFK my mule gets kicked, and even if i'm
there, chances are good I can't get back into trader mode in the bazaar!

I have a datarate of 6.0, I use ADSL, and I can't tell if there's a spike of
traffic or problems at eq servers. Is anyone else experiencing this?
