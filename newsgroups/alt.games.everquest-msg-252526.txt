I already have a Crypt Robber's Chestplate.
http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23209

The Chestplate of Vindication is really nice though.
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=5521

The stamina and HP are great for a Shaman like me who is constantly
Cani-Dancing. The Clicky 2 point regen is pretty awesome too. And the
resists would really give me a shot in the arm. Though my guild can
barely field one group of 50 to 60's let alone two groups of 65's. I
guess I'll have to search the bazaar for a good price and farm East
Freeport for the money. =)

The Ghastly Chestplate of Sacrifice has two usefull augment slots
though.
http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23169

It'd be nice to drop that Slot 3, Chest only, Regen 5 aug in there...
The combines Stamina, Hit Points, Wisdom, and Mana on the The Ghastly
Chestplate of Sacrifice would probably give me more useable mana than
the Stamina, Hit Points, and 2 Point Regen on The Chestplate of
Vindication. I can probably live without the resits on the CoV because
when the new patch comes though there will be plenty of augments
floating around to snatch up and aug everything I have with resists.
Then there is the Plate look verses the Chain look. Really tough
choice...

I guess I'll have to see how much the The Chestplate of Vindication
goes for and see if I can realisticlly farm the money sooner than I
could get the points for the The Ghastly Chestplate of Sacrifice.

Thanks for the info.

On a side note, does anyone know of a good No Graphic head piece for a
Shaman in his 50's? Preferably one that would be serviceable into his
60's.
