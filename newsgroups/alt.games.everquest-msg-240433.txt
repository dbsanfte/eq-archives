sure, but how was I supposed to know that the first time?. I just used 
the one that was selected? (I did find some good doc at 
http://www.eqlinks.com/

i may. or i may try final fantasy or something else (i sort of like a 
more ad&d style but i guess that is old hat now). this game (eq) *can* be 
a lot of fun if you are in a group. but how do you find a good group? i 
joined this one guy last night and he started killing one of the venders 
in a tent! and of couse got killed many times by other players for no 
apparanet reason (i made level 7 and 8 yesterday).

thanks
