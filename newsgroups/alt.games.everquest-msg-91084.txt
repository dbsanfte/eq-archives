You're in *their* world. There is no free speech and no real tech support.

If they would explain what is going on, instead of sending us system
messages advertising their new $500/year services while we try to immerse
ourselves in role-play, we wouldn't have to bitch at them.

This so-called scheduled downtime is somewhere on their web site immersed in
banner ads no doubt. Why not inform us the same why they keep showing us the
same disclaimer each time we log on?
