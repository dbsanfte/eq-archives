Sounds like you aggroed 4 specs, and 2 got hung up on pathing.  After a
while, they give up, and warp to where you are.  I can understand Verant
putting in the warping code as a catch-all to stop pathing exploits, but
they should have made it smarter.  Instead of warping on top of you,
they should warp to some place near you.  For example, they could check
for other mobs in pursuit of you that are not having pathing problems,
and warp the stuck ones there.
