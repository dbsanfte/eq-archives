I know what ya mean.I was at the forest giant fort and a 50th lev dude was
killing every thing.I wanted to say something but knew it would be
hopeless.I know what he was after, the beloved forest loop.I got ep and good
loot there.He got no ep and what would be to him crappy loot all to rob a
lower level guy out of a rare drop they would have been like winning the
lottery. But to him would be a days wage.That kinda ruins it for others.
