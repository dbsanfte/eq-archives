I started my shaman in may,2000 and I stopped playing about a year ago. 
Yes, there's alot of great memories.  I don't remember another game that 
will have these types of fond memories. Not sure if I'm getting EQ2 because 
I don't have the same time to play like I used to.  (whole weekends, 6 
hours+ after work on weekdays)
