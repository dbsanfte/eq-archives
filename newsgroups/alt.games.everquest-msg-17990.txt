I wonder why that is.. is that because when you pronounce it.. it sounds
like Shiter? (.. I didn't even think of that myself by the way.. )
or is it because of the ' in it?

I'm currently thinking about some good surname for a darkelf that suits my
character *grin*. I truely want it to sound like a dark elf surname.. and
before you all replied.. Shi'tar seemed like a good name to me :). Well..
guess have to be creative once more.
