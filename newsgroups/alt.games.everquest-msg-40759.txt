Personally, I will use it but I will never pay for what is really just
free player submitted content. A subscription fee for something like
everquest makes sense to me because I have a perm set of characters
there and they grow and change so there is value added. I will never
pay a subscription fee for any internet content, ever. If I won 273
million in the lottery tomorrow I still would not. I don't really
approve of it so I won't pay. However if I won 273 million in the
lottery tomorrow I might pay for the hosting of a site like
allakhazams for free.. bahaha.

Actually eventually it just won't be around to use. That is really
kind of evolution in a way to the way the web first started with some
hobbyists small sites with small bandwith use. We need a whole bunch
of people hosting part of the content of a site like Allakhazams
because one person hosting it and getting the bill when thousands use
it everyday is obviously a poor model. Having that poor model and
expecting the people using it to pay suddenly is semi deluded. Its sad
but these sites get killed by their own success. 

Hmm its a shame there is really no user friendly way to do such a site
over usenet. I mean, think about it. All of us have ISPS and many of
us (at least in the US without charges for timed phone use) get the
usenet feed with that for our flat monthly rate. I can look at all the
newsgroups I want and suck up all the bandwith I want but its never
costing anyone more money.. especially not the people posting the
stuff. Yet on a website it does. It almost seems like a website is
kind of backwards then. Of course there would really be no way to do
such a thing unless it was a clearly threaded and moderated set of
groups where the person doing it had to repost all of the content
every 7 days or so.
