Here is my idea for caster balancing... Since the beginning, one of the 
advantages of casters over melee classes has been that while melees have 
had to hunt for or buy their weapons at market prices, casters were 
always assured of finding their spells at their guild (with the exception 
of researched spells, but we'll leave this aside). The upside of that is 
that melees could use their weapons and armor as soon as they found or 
could afford them (again, we'll leave the few level-limited items aside).

So far, a nice balance... This, however, breaks down in the 50-plus game, 
when casters have to wait for their spells to drop, in addition to their 
inherent level limitation. I don't know about anybody else, but this is 
making my life as a high-end caster a bit miserable... While a melee 
class can aim for a particular weapon, and in the meantime settle for 
something nice although not quite as good, spells are an all-or-nothing 
proposition: You either have them, or not have them. I propose three 
possible solutions:

-Make all 51-60 spells useable at 51 (no way Jose, I know).

-Make all 51-60 spells purchaseable at vendors.

-Introduce a "scribing" skill that will allow a caster to transcribe a 
spell from their spellbook to a scroll. Make this a tradeskill, with only 
200+ scribes able to write down lvl 60 spells. This will make the spells 
more available, and be both a money sink (at low levels) and a money 
source for the more skilled ones (at high levels).

Would this be terribly unbalanced? I don't think so.
