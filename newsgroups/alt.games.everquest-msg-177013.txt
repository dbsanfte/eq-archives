My main is a rogue and I have a good time with him.

I am in an active guild and I am often called upon to get corpses and
stuff out of tricky places; the lock picking is interesting and the
backstabbing is a vital tool to any groups ability.

I kind of role play the rogue and I have great fun in doing so.  I
think that this comes from the old FRP games which I used to play.
