I was just curious as to how long you have played EQ? I can't see
dumping it if it were enjoyable just because they are experiencing
some temporary difficulty with bugs that I'm certain are being
addressed as we speak.

I, for one, very much enjoy the game. If it took them a month to get
the wrinkles ironed out, I would pick up where I left off.  It's worth
it.

Some idiots claim that they are being ripped off.  I don't guess I
blame them for wanting a refund for the time they are unable to play. 
They just need to remember that it's not Sony/Verant are making out
like bandits at our expense.  We only pay $10US/mo. and while a few of
us are unable to play, I'm sure their expenses are skyrocketing, what
with paying staff overtime and such.

There is nothing in it for them to delay the fixes any more than
absolutely necessary.

And, BTW, whereas it may have been "fine" before, now it is even
better once you are back playing. Just be patient.
