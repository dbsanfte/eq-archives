Two things, you mention that you installed the video drivers, and DX8.1.
Did you install your video and sound drivers again after installing DX8.1?
You need to do that.  The other possibility, I had my eqclient.ini set to
use DX8, and had the same problem, I set it back to DX7, and everything
worked fine.  Later I switched to the test server, downloaded all those
patches, switched back to the normal server, and downloaded those patches,
set eqclient.ini back to use DX8, and it started working.  The problem was
that eq would crash on trying to open the graphics library, as evidenced by
the debug.txt (or is it dbg.txt?) file in the everquest directory.
