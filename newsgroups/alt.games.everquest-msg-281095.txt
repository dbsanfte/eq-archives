Not necessarily... Dr Strangelove is classic black comedy and it was 
released at the height of cold war nuclear holocaust paranoia.

That said, Dr. Strangelove (and nuclear war in general) is a fairly

streets of New Orleans are part of somebodies family, a family that very 
likely still doesn't even know yet.
