 Me either. I've camped AC dozens of times with different people using
many, many screwy assed theories and never once got AC to spawn. Every 
single person I know (about 10 or so) that I have talked to about how 
they got the ring in SRO said they were just passing through and AC 
spawned right on top of them without doing a thing. Most were simply 
traveling to Guk through SRO and said they "got lucky".
 
 A week ago I gated to SRO to meet a friend in Oasis. By the time I 
got to the Oasis zone we decided not to meet. So I sat down on the
hill before leading to the Oasis zone to fool around with SneakyAmp
that I had downloaded earlier. After a few minutes of reading the 
docs for SneakyAmp and getting a few songs to change for me finally
I look up and AC is standing right in front of me unhurt and not
yet attacked by anyone else. I popped him with Ice Comet, rooted him
and finished with a second Ice Comet, looted the ring and happily
went to get the gold and Rapier to give to Hasten Bootstrutter.
 
 Only one person came up to me a bit later to congratulate me on the kill.
 
 I did nothing to make him spawn and there were like 4 low level players 
in the zone and I doubt anyone was using any theory to make him spawn 
before he popped for me.
 
 I wholeheartedly believe AC's spawn in South Ro is completely random. 
You simply have to just get lucky.
