Out of curiousity, how old are your computers?  I just built my new one
about 2 weeks ago after months of reading tech specs, reviews, prices, etc &
buying the components one at a time.  I put an ECS K7VZA motherboard into
mine & would have no trouble at all in getting 1.5Gb of ram into the thing.

Don't take it that I'm saying that your computers are crap & need to be
replaced.  Only you can decide if you need a new one.  I was just asking a
question.  I'm not real familiar with motherboards that only support 256Mb
of main memory & I'm too picky to accept one that doesn't support 1.5Gb.  My
fiance uses Photoshop 6 0 & Bryce 4 0.  Currently, I only have 512Mb
installed, but will be upgrading that to 768Mb in a couple weeks with an eye
toward 1.5Gb in the future.  But her app's are the only reason I have my eye
on that as my uses wouldn't come close to utilizing that kind of ram.
