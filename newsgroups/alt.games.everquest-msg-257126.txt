Ok .. well try running the game ... go to the EQ icon on your desktop
... right click it and go to properties ... under target location add
the words "patchme" no inverted commas with a space after the
everquest.exe

For example it could read c:\programs files\everquest\everquest.exe
patchme


Hope that wrapped ok .. give it a try and see if it works.
