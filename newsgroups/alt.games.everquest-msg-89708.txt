I have completed a short online documentary about EverQuest Players.
It is a brief look into the culture that has grown around the game.
The 16 minute video features an interview with Nick Yee, the
psychology student who has conduct extensive research into the virtual
community concept within the game, and footage from the Baltimore Fan
Faire. The video streams in RealVideo for free from my site
