Yeah, that whole think about the Catholic monarch taking over the
country, the protostands, and all that stuff, that couldn't *really* be
called a revolution.  I mean, after all, she was *eventually* ousted.

If you really believe that "your country's 'secrets'" are any less dirty
than any others and that your country is "up front" about them or that
the truly good ones are "time limited" then you've got a big surprise
coming.

Foolish statement.  We haven't gotten any good oil out of it *yet*.  If
we wanted to, we could but since we haven't, there must have been
*other* motives.  Follow?

Horsehocky.  The U.S. treats its prisoners *VERY* well.  Particularly in
comparison to "the rest of the world."  Care to talk about Turkish
prisons?  What about Milosovich war prisoners if you feel constrained to
stay in Europe?
