'EverQuest' addiction spreads to PlayStation 2
 
 
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) ï¿½ The U.S. online game arm of Sony said Tuesday
it plans to put its popular PC game EverQuest on Sony's PlayStation 2
console next year, bringing one of the best-selling game titles ever
to the console.

The game likely will serve as a marquee for the PS2's new online
capabilities, which will begin to roll out this summer.

The plans mark a milestone of sorts for Sony Online Entertainment
because it is the first time the online entertainment division has
licensed a product to its sister company, Sony Computer Entertainment
of America, which handles the PS2 in North America.

Under the agreement, Sony Online has officially become a licensed PS2
publisher, which will allow it to convert some of its other properties
to the console platform.

It plans to launch EverQuest Online Adventures as a subscription,
online-only product in spring 2003, though no monthly price has yet
been set.

The PC version of EverQuest, considered by video game players to be
among the 50 best electronic games ever, has more than 400,000
subscribers and has spawned multiple expansion packs. The last
expansion pack sold 120,000 units on its first day.

The game, which made it debut in March 1999, is generally considered a
model for successful online gaming, although it has been called
addictive by some health professionals.

Still, making EverQuest available online should boost interest in the
Web capabilities of the PS2, which has been a huge success as a video
game and DVD player, but has lacked online capabilities to date.

In early March, Sony Computer Entertainment of America, also known as
SCEA, announced it would release an adapter for the PS2 in August that
will allow the console to connect to the Internet, either through a
dial-up or broadband connection, for competitive online gaming.

At the time, SCEA said it planned to have at least a dozen titles
available at launch.

The PS2 has USB expansion ports that have gone largely unused since
the console was launched in November 2000, though Scott McDaniel, vice
president of marketing for Sony Online Entertainment, said the new
EverQuest will likely take advantage of the ports for data entry
purposes.

"Arguably, you could plug a USB keyboard into it," he said. "We will
be supporting that method of data entry."

The PS2 version will not be a "port" or rewrite of the PC game.

"It's completely new from the ground up," McDaniel said.

The PS2 version of EverQuest will be more friendly to introductory
gamers than the PC version, he said.

"It is a hard game to play, to be quite honest," McDaniel said, noting
that the PS2 version will have more obvious cues on how to play.
