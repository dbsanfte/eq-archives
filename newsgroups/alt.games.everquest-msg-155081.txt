Although im not ready to do my epic quest yet im worried by some of the 
things ive been reading on web sites about things you cant kill
Some levels earlier i killed the millers in qeynos hills and read that 
this faction isnt repairable and am worried now that i may have ruined 
my chances of ever doing my epic quest
Can anyone let me know if this is the case or not or what i can do to 
correct this
thanks
