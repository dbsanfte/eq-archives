Actually, it's not quite 1 billion... Pangaea (the 'super continent' that
might have existed before the landmasses split apart) was supposed to begin
spliting around 250 million years ago... still long enough ago for our
purposes, tho :o)

Carbon 14 dating only tells you how long ago something died... and isn't
that accurate beyond about 3000 years. But you're right about other
radio-dating techniques... even dendro-chronology (matching tree rings in
different pieces of wood) goes back over 10,000 years in some species. Also
Ice-Core sampling (so beloved of those who insist we're killing the planet
with global warming) goes back about 12-14,000 years, depending on which
method you use to date it.

Accretion Disc theory is a bit shaky at the moment, as it doesn't fully
explain some of the anomalies observed today (eg the orbits of Uranus, Pluto
and Neptune). But simpler physics like 'speed of light' and 'paralax
observation' shows there are stars farther away than 10,000 light years...
and because they're that far away and we can still observe the light and
radio emmisions they give off... they must be older than 10,000 years (and
therefore older than 'creation')

uhmmm, not really... and not with any degree of accuracy. For example, you
recall the big study about mytochondrial (the half of the feotal genome
passed on by the mother) DNA in humans a few years back that lead to the
thoery about there being a  'Mother of humanity' (named 'Lucy' for some
bizarre reason)? Well, they got it wrong and had to admit there couldn't
possibly be a SINGLE mother, and best guess was that there had to be 20-30
mothers in 'Generation 1' for there to be enough diversity to prevent us all
either dying out generations ago, or everybody having 13 webbed toes on each
foot.

Again, a slight exaggeration... DNA analysis doesn't work over millions of
years, simply because there isn't any million year old DNA to test as a base
line. HOWEVER... based on what we know now, and the snap-shot glimpses of
pre-history we can get from fossils (always a questionable source, simply
because so little of Earths history makes it into the fossil record) there
are other ways to examine species diversity and find a time-table for it.

Dunno enough about pre-history in Australasia (being in mind I'm a white,
european... to me, pre-history in that area of the world means everything
that happened before Capt Cook)

Compiled... then translated from Hebrew, into bad Greek, then Latin, then
English... and all HAND written translations, with further editing depending
on whose idea of the 'True Faith' offered less chance of getting burnt at
the stake or thrown to the lions.

But it's all considered to be an 'Article of Faith', which means you can't
argue against it logically, because faith doesn't need logic to sustain it.
If it gives you a warm feeling on those dark winter nights, then good for
you... just quit knocking on MY door with your earnest expressions and
asking me if I've heard the word
