    Indeed.  To be more specific, what it means is "Need Before Greed". 
The high-minded theory behind this is that if, for example, an item that
would obviously benefit a warrior much more than an enchanter drops for
a group, then the group's warrior would get the item, while the
enchanter would have no chance at all for it.

   Very popular, at least in the low to middle levels of the game,
because, well, it just _sounds_ right and fair.  The problem is the
actually implementation.  People may go to areas where item x drops for
class y, where they just happen to be class y.  Then they either form or
join a group, stating that NBG is the way to go.  Because it is so right
sounding, people will generally go along with it.  Heck, you can hardly
say "no" without sounding like a major asshole.  Low and Behold... item
x drops!  They get it... and then go sell it in the bazaar because they
already have it, or a better item for that slot.  All the group put
forth the same effort, faced the same risk, but NBG dictates that one
person reap most of the reward.

   It can also be unfair in less obvious situations.  You and I meet in
the zone Lair of the Tongue Lasher.  You are a warrior; I am a cleric. 
We have never met before, but decide to team up.  I mention at the start
that NBG might be a good idea.  Not being a greedy jerk, you agree.  We
both equally split the proceeds of our fighting... gems and fine steel
weapons and whatnot.  Both of us are happy with the money we are
making.  Then, a cleric only spell, Tunare's Tampon of Tempting, drops. 
I do not have it, and have been wanting it for a long, long time.  You
have no need of it.  So great, it's fairly mine, right?  Well, under
NBG, yes, of course.  But.... that spell sells in the bazaar on our
server for 5k.  You are only wearing a bronze faceplace.. that five
grand could get you a LONG overdue upgrade in your equipment.  But the
spell is mine, even if I am riding a horse, wearing planar equipment in
all slots, and spending a mint on whatever tradeskill gets me hot and
sweaty.

   NBG between strangers simply isn't fair, in the big picture.  It's
different if you and I are old friends who often hunt together.  In the
long run of a relationship, NBG does even out to fairness.  And
presumably, your friend's don't want to rip you off (I know, I tend to
be a optimist). But in pick up groups with people you don't know very
well, well, NBG means you're about to get robbed in named in altruism.
