I have a problem with the graphics. Sometimes when I turn/pan the view
the games seems to skip displaying that view and instantly skips to
the next screen draw (ie if I sit and pan my view, it will skip what
should have been the next screen coming into view and turn me facing
the screen after the one it skipped)

Seems to be related to views that have a lot of graphics so i'm
guessing my system can't handle displaying that certain view and skips
it. If I pan back the other way it will do it again, only this time it
is sort of a half-skip. Pan back again and it will be ok. 

Some places it happens every time, the bridge over the water heading
into qeynos bank, every time I turn to go onto the bridge where it
should show me the bride and view of the entrance to the bank, it will
skip it every time and I end up in the water. SK/NK bridge does it
every time too.

Changing graphic settings doesn't seem to make any difference. System
is athlon 2G, 512 ram, radeon 9000 64M. Anyone got any ideas ?
