As a former guildleader of a mid-level guild, I sympathise.
I will say that it was said to me when we started the guild
(originally as a friendly guild, progressing to a raiding one)
that we would find it hard to make that transition from
friendly to raiding. We did, it wasn't that that stopped the
guild, but it did cause a lot of upset.

The worst thing is, to be making a jump like that at all
is entirely down to how the content is arranged, over the
levels. To not be cut off from 90% of the content, you have
to adapt your play style to the template that's set out, as
if there is a sudden ramp of difficulty where, unless you
get serious, you can't progress further. If they applied the
design ethos of the more complex and involving end-game
encounters to early guild raidable content (and I'm talking
about as low as level 10 here) then you could be that
type of guild from very early on. Similarly, if there were
an alternate path for casual guilds to progress at the high
end, it would at least soften the blow. That's one of the
suggestions I made in relation to this summit, btw.
