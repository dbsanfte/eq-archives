I was wondering about that statement myself. Even with my feeble BW
skill cap of 100, I can bind for 25 points of damage per tick. While I
know there are some monster dots out there on big time mobs that
probably do more than that, the majority do less than 25 so you can keep
somebody alive till the dot wears off just bandaging, assuming neither
of you move and botch it up.

And with First Aid 3, I can go on to bandage them to 80% health after
the dot wears off, which is pretty much back in fighting shape for most
anyone.
