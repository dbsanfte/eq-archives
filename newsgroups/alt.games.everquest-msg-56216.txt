    Yup. Some of the other points in this patch addressed complaints from
Sullon Zek that have been outstanding a long time. This has to do with how
ALL deaths, including PvP deaths (and remember, corpse camping is not an
offense here) cause XP loss on Sullon.

    The only thing that really got hosed by TLC in SM was the quests. If you
really want to see what you've been missing, go to The Warrens and take a
tour of the named spawns.

    Please, let it be fixed. PLEASE, let it be fixed. Hopefully they'll fix
ALL inner wall interactions in the near future, but I'm not holding my
breath for that.

    /hug. I can understand why they fear bottom-feeders going to green
dungeons and AoE'ing the entire zone for a few hours. But there has to be
some percent penalty other than 100% that would keep folks out of green
zones.

    Coin dropping creates potential for dupe bugs. I see this as more an
experiment to kill ALL coin dupe bugs in EQ that don't involve a corpse. If
it works, they may very well do the same to items. Abashi posted a defense
of this decision on the Development boards, if you want to see the
"official" reasons.

    I don't mind not seeing some numbers. Up to level 54, the blue line is
"good enough" for XP - I don't need to see exactly how many XP I get per
kill, and would find that information to be useless clutter on whatever
screens it was displayed on. (Quest XP I'd LOVE to see, but that's a
different matter. 8) ) This heal info seems just as useless, to me - my
cleric doesn't care if she's hit a new personal best Complete Heal. If I'm
healing early, I'm slacking, and I certainly don't want the person being
healed to say "hey, you heal too soon! u suxors!" Especially when nukers
don't have their resists and mob-nearly-dead-nukes for 12 damage shown to
everyone.

    The only number I'd like to see would be a "mana total" under the HP
total on the character info screen. Wouldn't be intrusive, would give folks
without knowledge of how mana is computed some idea of what improves them
and what doesn't, would give exact info on per tick mana regen under
different circumstances, would give exact percent reductions in spell costs
due to specialization, would tell you exact total mana pool.... Yeah, I'd
like that one.
