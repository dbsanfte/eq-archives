And a very different fight. The AE slow is brutal. I drop from routine
70+ DPS on large raid targets to about 4. The trick:

(1) Spell-based damage and lots of it (Gore has 32k hps.)
(2) Nuke early and often. Expect to die.
(3) Let Gorenaire CHeal. The maximum for a CHeal is 10.5k. This is 10
seconds that she's not meleeing. If you can't do significantly more
than 1050 DPS as a guild, you can't kill her anyway.
(4) Mod Rods.
(5) If the fight's not over in 30 seconds, you've lost.

HTH in the future.
