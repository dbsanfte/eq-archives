Swiftwind [the off hand weapon] in particular is very much worth doing
due to the haste and ATK boosts it gives.  The best advice I can give
at 31 would be to use *forage* at every possible waking moment so that
by the time you come to actually sit in Everfrost et al and try for
those Epic forages your forage will be high enough that you don't take
over 20 hours like I did (went from 170 to 184 from start to finish).

FWIW my Foraging seems perma stuck at 186, I haven't had an increase
for six months and pretty much given up on ever getting it ANY higher.
I recently foraged 14 Dragon Claw Shards in ToV, gave them to some
confused Monk in East Commons who wanted to know where I'd bought
them.
