Hi, I'm a level 14 high elf enchanter. I'm looking for a place to hunt.
Every race, class, level combination has some mod to kill that gets you tons
of exp without much threat. Where is mine? The chess board is too low level
now. The Minotaur Caves are too boring and dangerous. I just tried Unrest
today. I was in a group for a good four hours and we killed tones of yellows
and reds, and I barely got 1/4 bubble of experience. A friend told me to try
Befallen. I was going to give it a try next, but before I make the trek on
over to Antonica, I wanted to ask you people in the newsgroup. Where do you
think I should hunt?
