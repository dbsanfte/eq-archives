It's a perfectly valid theory, and rather annoying you insist it can't
possibly be true.

The marketing department may have decided EQ1 would sell better with a
lower monthly fee (i.e., without "content upgrade" costs built in),
and instead, charge for expansions.

They may have decided that higher monthly fees may have discouraged
some non-trivial number of subscriptions.

You're not thinking things through.  The greed theory is a perfectly
viable explanation.

They raised the price to match what other MMORPGs demonstrated could
be charged.  An extra buck a month wouldn't cover the expansion costs
most subscribers probably paid.

In the end, greed is a perfectly valid explanation, whether or not you
choose to accept it.
