All classes at level 7 are pretty much the same.  They can all solo
effectively.  Newbie iksar monks have a big advantage because of the number
of really good hunting areas and REGEN (and the ability to solo at night).
My ikkie monk is 18 now and still soloing, but he's just one of my 6
characters that I play when I don't feel like playing my druid (47) or
enchanter (46) so he hasn't really looked for groups yet.

But now is the time...Feign Death works a lot more now than it did last
level so it's about time for him to go out and be designated puller.  His
value in a group has definitely gone up, and with the upcoming xp changes
his being an iksar won't count against him.

(if you don't know what changes I mean, there's a link at
