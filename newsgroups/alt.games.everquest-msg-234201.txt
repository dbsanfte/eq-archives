I've used PC for my alts as well, but I solo them through PC, can't stand 
the idiots that infest that place, no way I would group with them.

Soloing and grouping can be very different, in part it does depend on the 
class.  Druid soloing is very different from playing main healer to a 
group for example.  Quad kiting wizards do not learn agro control, which 
is quite important for groups.
