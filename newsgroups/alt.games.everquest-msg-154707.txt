Well if you don't FCFS them you lose out... because you know they *will*
FCFS you.

Thats why I see nothing wrong with it.. its just the laws of the jungle for
a server that I play on

A lot of people confuse FCFS and jacking with peoples raids, grief play and
disputes etc..  whilst it might not be a perfect system, its not how some
people would try to portray it

If your just waiting for a few stragglers then it would imply you had a
force in-zone already.. if the majority of required force is present then
the other guild owuld (should) leave the zone

E.g tormax, 2 guilds form for him, both assemble at the bank, 8-8 (people
count), then 8-16 to them, 17-16 to us, 17-30 for them.. the second guild
obviously wins the race, and leaves

Waiting for 5 people for Tormax would still mean a mass majority of the raid
force was in-zone... waiting for 5 people on VS would be like half - 1/4 the
raid not being present.  Any decent self-respecting guild would leave Tormy
alone if the first guild was so close, wheras VS would still probably be
open to FCFS.

And if you drag your feet etc then you should be prepared to be FCFS'd..
either your ready to engage, or they are and pulling
