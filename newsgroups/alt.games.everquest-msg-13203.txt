Before we go any further, can you point out where I claimed to be an
expert in the field of security? Or any field, for that matter?

You are inventing things.

No, my position is that any computer user can take reasonable
precautions to virtually eliminate any chance of being hacked, and
that every individual is responsible for taking these steps.

You are inventing things again. I never said anything at all about
encryption.

Speaking of long rants about how smart one is...

<extreme snip>

And again, in case you've missed it every other time - I never claimed
to be an expert. I claimed to be a computer professional.

I'm aware of that, and of all the other long-winded rambling you did.
But here's a point you overlooked - if it's so easy to do, why isn't
it happening *all* *the* *time*? Surely this would be a favorite
target of all the script kiddies.

Only in your warped interpretation of what I wrote.

I appreciate that this is a hot-button sort of item for you - that's
obvious from your rabid, if often incorrect, zealous reaction. But try
not to let your enthusiasm for arguing about it continue to cloud your
ability to actually comprehend the thread. Perhaps if you paid a bit
more attention to what people *actually* write in their posts rather
than what you believe they're writing, you might not appear to be a
complete buffoon.
