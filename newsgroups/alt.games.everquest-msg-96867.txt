I didn't know that either.  One of my sons started a bard and tried
several times to get a name with 'sing' or 'song' in it, and each was
denied.  After one of the attempts he got a tell from a guide that
said something like 'Look, you know I've denied these several times
already; if you keep trying this I'm might suspend your account.'

He panicked.  He logged off, shut down the computer and asked me
what sort of trouble he was in.  I don't know why he has such an
exaggerated respect for authority, but I have no doubt that the
guide certainly didn't know the fear they had just instilled in him.
The names were not at all offensive, by the way.  They were things
like 'Singasong' and 'Iliketosing.'  A few times since then, when a
name I enter for his brother is rejected, he'll say 'Daddy, don't get
us in trouble.'

Anyway, the part of which I was unaware was that if there is no
guide on, or the guides on are busy approving other names, your
name might go through with no human approval.  I had assumed
that any name that wasn't rejected due to automatic filtering would
necessarily be seen by a guide.  It makes me wonder if some of my
characters, nearly all of whom have fairly silly names, will one day
be changed by a guide.  I will not stress over it if they are.
