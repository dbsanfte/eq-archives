In an exp group I'd have to disagree. That wizard with the 5k mana
pool isn't going ot regain his mana any faster than the other one. I'd
argue that flowing thought and focus items are more important for a
caster than hitpoints but once you get to a certain level, mana pool
for a non-raiding player becomes a non-issue. When you do have to go
into 'mana-dump' mode, knowing that you can take a few hits if you get
agro is always useful. 

Even among the int casters, I'd say that most of the good enchanters
and necros I know are going after hitpoint gear.
