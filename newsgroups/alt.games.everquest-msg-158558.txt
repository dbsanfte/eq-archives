That's not at all true, there are a lot of other expenses that I would 
say are really there to drain money out of the economy. Being a cleric 
peridots for symbols come to mind. A lot of other spells use costly 
components too (CoTH, avatar, summon corpse, DB nukes etc). Talked to 
this fella who used to lead raids for his guild the other day, said a 
ToV clearing could cost upwards of 20-30k at times (probably not the 
norm though). Another cash sink is horsies.
