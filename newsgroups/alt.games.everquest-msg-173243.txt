Excuse me kaev.  I misunderstood your post.  On reading back I take back
what I said... I think your point was that the US provides a measure of
protection, not that we might nuke everyone if we didn't care about their
opinion...

Nevertheless I do think that the US cares not so much about whether Mr.
Jimbob International gets all warm and fuzzy when he thinks about us as that
the world is stable.  I think we'd rather have a stable international scene
than be universally loved.  So, no, I don't think the US cares about PR when
it comes to actions against countries who are a threat to the free world.
