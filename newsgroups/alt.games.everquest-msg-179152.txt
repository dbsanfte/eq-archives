min cha for me at 50ish was 125ish which quickly got updated to 150.  You
will notice better mezzing ability with higher charisma, which makes it more
effective use of your mana.  Personally I believe its better to have a 150
cha 150 int than 200 int 100 cha.  You should notice much less resists the
more cha you get.

If you get down to some of what the previous dude was saying, he was talking
about swapping out alot of int items for cha.   5 dex 7 cha rings would be a
good start.  charisma is alot cheaper to come by than INT.  5 cha 2 AC
earrings from unrest for like 10 or 20 plat should be easy enough to come by
until you get the less cha, more HP MANA earrings from Hole.  crown of king
tranix would be like 12 or 15ish cha for 4 int from your head.  Skyshrine or
Kael helm gives 10 int and 15 cha, which would be even more ideal.  you need
crushed flame opals to make them.

If you have any doubts about high charisma talk to several higher level
enchanters and ask their opinion.
