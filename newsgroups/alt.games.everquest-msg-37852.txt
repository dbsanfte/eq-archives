When are clerics ever not grouped? ; )

And they would be justified simply saying "sorry, busy" whether they are in a
group or not.

And yes, it's perfectly fine for a grouped wizard or druid to charge an

service it is.  Although as the group member, I'd reserve the right to decide
then whether I was upset about them leaving or not.
