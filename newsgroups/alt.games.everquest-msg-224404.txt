I always assume that if you're at a zoneline, you are NOT prepared to take
mobs.  I also presume if you're sitting there, you know the risk of sitting
on the rails.  I hate it when people pull critters to the zone and then
expect help, and it bugs me when people bitch about being zone-trained
becuase they went AFK.  ;/  (Just move a few yards to the left and put on
any invis you have, there ya go.)
