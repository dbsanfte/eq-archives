    Yes, I do. Now imagine having to do exactly the same number of combines
to get to 242 skill, only instead of Fine Steel Plate Cloaks you have to
make Enchanted Brellium Plate Bracers. D'yer think the price will go up
doing it that way? Do you think the hassle time of gathering the components
for the temper will be greater than the hassle time on leather padding?
That's what this change will entail. If you don't have the skill now, you
will be killing yourself later skilling up.

    The new items being promised by Yak and co. will supposedly have effects
that will make being a tradesperson worthwhile (for a little while, at
least). The new series of self-only ports to your home temple, for example,
are going to be attached to tradeskill-produced items. The ability to
self-port myself to Kaladim any time I wanted would be well worth the time
invested in tradeskills, and my trades are already fairly good (lowest skill
is my 160 Tailoring, have a near-full set of Geerlock items for the extra
5%). I imagine they'll use the items that can be made in Cazic Thule as
models for the new stuff, not that anyone's seen them because of the drop
problems....
