Okay, my bad, I never put a site for traffic before, and didn't know there
was a tramsfer limit/

Will try to find another place where the site will not be limited in how
much  it can be accessed in a single day...

"The web site you are trying to access has exceeded its allocated data
transfer."

I assume that is what this message referred to

will update...

Thanks to all for the 100 hits
