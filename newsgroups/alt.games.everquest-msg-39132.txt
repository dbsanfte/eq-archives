I dont know if anyone else has noticed this but since the last big patch a
few weeks ago my fire pet seems to take an awful long time to cast his
damage shield.

Before the patch i would summon my pet and he would DS himself almost
imediately, since the patch i have occasionally had to wait up to 20 minutes
before the pet cast his damageshield; i have noticed the same problem with
air pets and invisibility.

Is this a problem that anyone else is haveing ?
