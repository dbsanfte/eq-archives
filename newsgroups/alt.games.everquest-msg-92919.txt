With a single original-question-followed-by-a-single-reply,
top-posting would make some sense.  But even then, people
new to a thread, or who received the reply but not the original
question, would see someone start to talk and then wonder,
"what in the heck are they blathering on about?", until
they finally got down to the question below and said,
"oh, *now* I see..."  Even then it makes for some jarring
moments.

HOWEVER...  For every other scenario, top-posting is far,
far, far messier than bottom-posting.

For example:  When there is a back-and-forth conversation
going on, especially with multiple participants, top-posting
results in the conversation getting read "backwards", which
can be a real mess.  It's like watching the movie "Memento"
(in which the scenes are presented in reverse chronological
order).

Even more to the point, often it's best to respond to
a post at multiple points instead of in one "blob".  If
the original post asked five questions, it makes the most
sense to answer the questions not on top, but *inside* the
quoted post, like:

    > OP's first question

    Respondant's answer to the first question

    > OP's second question

    Respondant's answer to the second question

    [etc.]

This makes for *very* easy reading, whereas top-posting
the answers would be very hard to follow.  (And note that
the above is a special form of "bottom-posting", since
the answers appear at the bottom of the text to which
they are responding).

Now imagine responding to a post like the example given
above, if you had extra comments to add to the answers
given for questions 2 and 3...  Top-posting would make hash
of the previously clean post -- now you've got a top-and-
middle-bottom-posted post, which is nearly impossible to
follow.

Bottom posting (including "interspersed" bottom posting)
makes every post to the newsgroup its own easy-to-follow
narrative; even with several layers of give-and-take,
it reads (from top-to-bottom) like a conventional
written conversation, where "time" passes in the normal
direction as you read from start to finish.

If you already remember what came before, fine, skip ahead.
If not, however, you can read it straight through without
having to hop all over the place.
