All Spells are obtainable if they are a dropped spell it takes a group to
get them. Wait till you go after spells in FG you can not single pull the
Mobs till 55 for a level 51 spell, but a group can handle the extra adds.
Research is part of being a Wizard if you don't want to to do the research
then you have to pay someone to do it for you. Besides you can make good
money off research lots of people would rather pay for the spells.
