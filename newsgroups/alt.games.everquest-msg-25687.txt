And your post gives us a name (regardless if fictional or not) to associate
it with.  The document that was provided had no author.  If anything, I
failed to mention that the author was "unknown" as required to do.

Because I wish to triple check myself to see if an author is indeed not
named anywhere within the document.  Though, perhaps the main reason I took
it down was due to bandwidth.  I underestimated the number of people that
would grab that file actually.  <grin>
