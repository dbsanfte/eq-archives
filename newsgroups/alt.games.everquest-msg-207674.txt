I'd have to agree with you, actually, though now that I think of it that
way, I might be more inclined to enjoy it more. I was always better at art
than at skills. :/

Since my recent return to EQ, I've learned more about pulling than I ever
knew, I think.

I never thought of doing that...good idea.

At the moment I think it's kinda goofy and fun, so I'll just be doing
that. :)  Once we're done with this part of his quest, we'll need to go
into the south wing for the final battle, and it'll be thatmuch easier if
I don't have to wait for a rogue...

*grin* Drusilla comes...someday. But you are right, we're just looking to
get several skellie spawns so we can get his skulls.

And incidentally, our trip to HS went reallywell last night.  We only did
the entrance, but the east corridor wanderer was a hexbone skeleton that
dropped a dusty iksar skull. :D  Now we just need to get the 4 glowing
skulls, but those can drop in the west wing, which I'm pretty darned sure
we can handle.  We'll find out tonight.

What really surprised me was how *good* the XP was even at 60.  The
entrance mobs went down fast, so we had a lot of downtime, but even so we
walked away with 21% more regular XP...easiest I've gotten since I was in
my 40s. If we had had constant pulls, I would have gotten XP at TWICE the
rate we got in PoD, and on mobs maybe half as hard.  CAsh loot wasn't bad
either, and I got my only 61st level drop spell.

So I'm very very excited to head into the north and west wings this
weekend for glowers. With any luck we'll get to 61 there, and this weekend
we can bring some friends into the south wing to drop VEnril Sathir and
get Rakyn his 8th cudgel. =D This is really Rakyn's "true epic" (cabilis
faction is a *BIT* harder than truespirit, and you still have to run
around killing lots of tough mobs :P), so it's an exciting prospect.

If they keep the ZEM the same in HS, and just raise the level of th mobs,
I think I've found a new favorite home. Just, ah, lemme get his cudgel
finished before the revamp. :P

P.S. Did you notice that message about fixing a few zones in this mornings
patch? I BET they finally put angry goblin in FM...
