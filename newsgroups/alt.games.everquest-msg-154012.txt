I'm organizing this for Friday Oct 11th, at 8:30PM Eastern.  Again, if I can
get someone who can bind the Gnomes in Gfay near CB zone on some server
other than EMarr, it would be appreciated.  People are welcome to drop in
and participate, I would ask that you don't invite your entire guilds and
such, but, we certainly won't mind having extra people drop in for the fun.

How did I do with the work schedule there Ryou?
