I did it yesterday, and what you need to do is find Helminth (he
should be just outside the evil guild entrance), and tell him
"An investigator is dead". Then he'll ask you if Vegalys sent you,
and if you respond "vegalys sent me", he'll demand proof. Give
him the seal, he returns it and becomes Corruped Guard Helminth,
and starts attacking you along with two necros. Kill him last.

When you kill Helminth, Azibelle spawns just past the spectres in
the evil guild. She's a 45 SK, with a HT of 551, hits for 117 and
uses all the usual SK spells (fear included, high MR or Fearless is
recommended). She has about 7k hp.

Stats on the Honor Badge of Qeynos are:

AC: +5

STR: +4
WIS: +4
INT: +4
AGI: +4

HP: +25
MANA: +25

Permanent See Invis effect.

Looks like the medallions you get off froggies in TT, the ones
you need for OS keys.

I hope this quest line will continue, but given the name of this
piece, it might be the last. But hey, I can't complain, this is
better than my old BAM.
