Yes and no, all aa is based on lvl 51-->52 experience. If you would put it
at 50% at lvl 51 they would move at exactly the same speed. When hitting
lvl52 you will see something strange, the aa bar will at 50% move faster
than your expbar. cayse lvl 52-->53 is more difficult than the still lvl
51-->52 wich is used for aa.

In theory you should wait till 59 why, cause you enjoy all the spells and
benefits of that lvl. Means bigger manapool more hp spells etc. etc. etc.
And you can make fast aa against lb/db mobs wich might be red mobs to a lvl
51. On the other hand, there are the archtypes wich you can consider usefull
for lvling faster to 59. Like innateregen and mental clarity etc. etc. So
basically it's a tradeoff and depends very much on your class, race and
hunting habbits. As a dru i'm more manadepending than you manaregen
(archetype) would for me decrease downtime a lot. (i can hit 60 on elysians
in umbral plains) but no matter how big my manapool is, it's empty at a
certain point regen would decrease that a lot for me. So i went straight to
55 now full aa to get that regen and move on to 59 to backfill all other
interesting archetypes classtypes and advancements like resists. What your
trajectory should be, i don't know maybe it's for you worthwhile to head
straight to 59 or maybe you get a very usefull spell at 56 that makes it
worthwhile to wait for that before doing aa.
