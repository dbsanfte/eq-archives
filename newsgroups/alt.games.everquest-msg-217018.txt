I watch the fights, but when everyone is standing close together, it's
hard to see visually exactly who is being hit. I also have to have
others hits turned off or the battle spam kills me. Also, this shaman
got hit once or twice while 3 of the melees in the group were being
hit - I was too busy patching them up to notice that not all of her hp
loss was canni caused, and I don't go around hitting my assist key
while I am in the process of casting heals, either.
