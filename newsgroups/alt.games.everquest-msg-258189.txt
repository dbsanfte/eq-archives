The thing I'm wondering is what are the "so many quests"? One has been
named. What are others? How many unsolved and/or broken quests are
there? How many is this in proportion to the number of working quests?

Not saying the broken/too hard ones don't need to be addressed, just
wondering about a choice of wording to make it sound like a bigger
issue than it actually is.
