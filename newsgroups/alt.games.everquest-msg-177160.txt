Play what you want.  With 4 people who know how to play almost
anything is workable.  And if you all are playing a class you are
interested in then how much more fun is it?  Who wants to get stuck in
a class they don't want because it makes a better 'power group'?

We have this going on right now and we have a Paladin, Shaman,
Enchanter, and Bard.  Everyone's having fun because they're playing
what they want and we're still kicking butt.
