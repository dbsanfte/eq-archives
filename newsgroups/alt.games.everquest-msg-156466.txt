I can remember the time i was level 52, and fully geared (which wasn't much
at the time) there was almost nothing I could solo in DL.

The yeti's were doable for a good few levels, but spiders, drolvargs?  I had
no chance.

Sure with fungi and nice weapons you could now, but I didn't have either
then, and if he was naked... then obviously neither did he

So you killed something NAKED at 45 that could pwn (or extremely close
fight) me in my early 50's?

Now admittedly the gear people have now is way better than my leveling days,
I got a FBSS at 49 when it was almost unheard of to have any other sort of
haste, but skills havent changed to the level that would imply the above
being easily doable

You either got extremely lucky... or your a lieing pos

I have a 45 monk on an alt account, hes actualy parked in FV would you
believe.   I'll post the logs tonight

I know what my moneys on
