If someone asks me "What's the loc of the BB zone" in shout, I reply in
shout, "Go south until gnolls attack you!" or something else at least
vaguely in character.  It never stops them from doing it again, but it has
gotten a laugh from other players.  If someone asks in ooc, they get the
answer if I have it.
