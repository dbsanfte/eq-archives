i petition when loot is plooted (when i attended open raids), when there are
reportable shout/ooc's of people admitting to training / ks'ing....

occaisionally i've petitioned really offensive names


i never hear jack from GM's, only guides saying they'll look into
it....which inevitably means nothing

so...i think stuff like this is why people complain about GM's
