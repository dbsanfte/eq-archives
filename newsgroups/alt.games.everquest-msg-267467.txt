I don't want a split, and I'm not playing EQ1 -or- EQ2.  I don't have a 
dog in this hunt.

Initially, I was in favor of a split, because I figured it would mean 
those pesky EQ2 posts, which I don't really contribute to, would go 
away, and I'd be back in my idyllic EQ1 only NG.

But then I thought about (and read arguements about) what it means to 
the group itself, and decided that it was better for both games, and for 
the community, to -not- split.

Again, for -my- purposes, this is better, because the people I'm here to 
chat with all stay in one nice neat place, instead of splitting into 
multiple organisms.

However, thats not the deciding factor, for me personally, either result 
has a good side and a bad side, so do what you like... but I think it 
would be better for you all to stay together and start tagging your 
posts (EQ2)... and think about (EQ1).
