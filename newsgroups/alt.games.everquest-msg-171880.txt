I highly recommend the Firiona Vie server. Fantastic community of
RPers and a different rule-set from all of the other servers...

1. Only 1 character per account
2. Almost ALL items are droppable/tradeable (Epics are not as well as
some other exceptions)
3. Languages matter. (You only know your races language when you
start)
4. TLC (Trivial Loot Code) If you kill a green mob and it drops a
"magic" (also some lore, and nodrop) item, you will not recieve the
item. This is to prevent higher level characters from farming greens,
and encourage bottom-up trading between lower and higher level
players. For example if a wisp is green to you you will not be able to
kill it for a Lightstone or GreaterLightstone.
5. Fairly small population. Very little competition for camps/zones.
