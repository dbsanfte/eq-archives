*nods*.  Agreed. With my previous characters (both my human monk and my wizzie) I spent
several levels each on wisp island.  Out of sheer annoyance, I did a statistical analysis
of the silk drops from the spiders there, compared to the giant spiders in EC and the
desert tarantualas.  Later I threw in the heart spiders of guk and the craigs.  Posted it
here, but damned if I could lay my hands on it now.  Anyway, in terms of silk, wisp island
is probably your *worst* choice. They had the lowest silk drop rate of any spiders I've
ever hunted. (You can often literally have a dozen spiders go by with maybe one silk
between all of them.)  In addition, the other warnings you received on this are *so* true.
Those spiders have a huge aggro range and the island is lousy with them.  You can very
easily get swarmed in no time at all, and there's no zone line to run to.  And their poison
makes the poison on the giant spiders in EC look like baby formula. I don't remember how
many hits/tick it was, but it was ugly. I died to those bastards many a time.
  You're too low level for Guk and EK Craigs yet, so I'm afraid your best choice is to just
stick to commons and N. Ro and hunt the spiders, giant spiders, and tarantualas.  Not a lot
of silk, but one of your only options I'm sad to say.
