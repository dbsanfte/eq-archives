What he forgot to add is that once you have opened the package, you may be
unable to return it.  This is because once the CD key is used, it is not
reusable, so, generally, an opened copy of the game is a useless copy of the
game.  On every box I have seen it does state that there is a fee to play
the game.  You do indeed get to play one month free, although you will be
asked for credit card information in order to start playing, and they will
start billing you automatically after one month if you do not cancel the
account.
