Why is it highly doubtful that he was a frontline soldier?

There is a Time interview from 1996 that says he took part in the defence of
a town called Jaji, and also that he later led an offensive against the
Russians. Another report says he was wounded by shrapnel in battle. In one
interview, he himself says he was 30m from the Russian guns.

I do not know the truth of the matter, but to me, it seems more likely that
he was involved in the fighting against the Russians.

I guess it will be hard to ever find out for sure, now that the demonisation
process has started. We will soon find out he was a high school dropout,
selling crack to 12 year olds.
