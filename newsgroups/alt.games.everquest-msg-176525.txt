There are casual guilds, check the official VS guilds board at

Well, on Venril Sathir, we have the "market" channel, which is a
general chat channel that sometimes gets used for buying/selling
stuff. I'll leave it to you to decide if you like the channel - I keep
it on mostly for the amusement factor.

I play an Iksar shaman named Azlar on Venril Sathir, if you have
questions feel free to ask. I probably won't be playing him much,
though, because of recent developments on VS brought on by the
movelog.
