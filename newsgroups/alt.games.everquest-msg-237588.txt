Sounds more like an ISP problem rather than hardware problem.

Any other programs running like P2P/Torrent clients? (yeah I know you're on 
a 56K, but I had to rule it out).

Try using EQTrace to ping and poll against the server you play on. The GUI 
can give you a nice overview of trace from your PC to the server and give 
clues to any bottlenecks there might be on the route.

The program is a bit old (Jan 29, 2003) so hop you are not playing on a 
newer server.

Connect to Internet, run EQTrace, make a trace to your server and then poll 
(as far as I recall).

And woah forgot the most important thing! Since you're using a 56k modem, 
remember that these modems are very very very sensitive to noise.

The noise can be generated by e.g., many phones attached to the same line, 
line being splitted to several plugs, tel. cable being near power supplies.

If your modem, while online, detects a higher or lower level of noise, it 
will try to renegotiate line speed and this will give you a hole where 
traffic is halted. In cases, where noise is at a such high level that line 
speed cannot be negotiated your call will be terminated.

If you go online sometimes just for EQ, then try add commands by init 
strings (see more on your modem manufacturer's website or in modem 
newsgroups) that forces your modem to run at lower speed, like 28Kbps.

This can make the call less sensitive for noise.
