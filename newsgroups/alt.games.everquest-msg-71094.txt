not at all. The poster isn't specific either way. It  can  be read as being
applicable to him/her or to the whole, or both.

Still the fact is the game is unplayable for some to differing degrees. Some
can't get on at all. Some are LDing  far too much, some can't go on the
raids they used to..etc etc.

I'm willing to give them time to see if they can resolve the issues.
