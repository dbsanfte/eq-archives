Has anyone figured this out yet?
The rpgexpert website, (enhancing your POP charm in LDON), explains how to
obtain the stone and how to make it wearable by combining it with a the
Intricate Wooden Figurine POP charm from POK. You have to make it wearable
because the stone by itself is only an augmentation item.
Now, after you have completed a number of successful adventures the item is
supposed to gradually develop useful stats. I have more than 10 successes in
one camp and at least 2 in every other camp but no sign of any stats yet.
This is driving me mad, does anyone know any more about getting the stats to
start showing?

Thanks, Ian
