    Bah, that's not fair. Sang does have a ton of excellent information on
the upper-end game at his disposal. I've learned a lot reading his posts.
Where I think he fails is in two places:

1) Disconnection with the so-called "average player". He's likely always
been at the top of the curve on his server, and just doesn't realize what
folks have in the way of gear, organization, and experience. He therefore
overestimates their capabilities. If a person has never been to Siren's
Grotto before, it is the LAST place they should think of heading to find a
pick-up group.

2) "Glossing". Example from my server: going to www.vismaior.net, you see
that my server's top guild killed Ventani with no deaths! Outstanding....
except they don't mention what happened on the previous attempts that day,
when they were wiped out. They glossed over the difficulties to make
themselves look better. Sang made it sound like many of the places he
described were simple to get to, easy to CR from, and could be done by an
Erudite paladin and a Half Elf druid. Yet, in application, he himself goes
to Velk's, likely because of all the reasons everyone else goes there, and
despite the XP efficiency drawbacks.

    Despite the sarcasm you see in my posts, I really do admire what he's
accomplished and how well he presents his knowledge of the nuts and bolts of
EQ. He reveals a lot more here than most uberguild leaders would ever reveal
about the high-end game. More than once I've been tempted to do enough of a
search to figure out who he is and what server he's on, just so I could pop
on and say thank you (druid guildlead of a guild that woke the Sleeper -
wouldn't be hard, minor search on FoH's site and legwork would do it). I
just violently disagree with his perception of how easy EQ is for the
average Joe that doesn't put in the hours and hours of time he has - what's
the average "expected time online" for a top guild, 7-12 pm every weekday
and more on weekends? That's a lot of time to get things accomplished that
others would have to catch up with.
