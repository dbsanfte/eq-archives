/Petition I lost my fine steel long sword when I dropped it on the ground, 
can you please check the logs and replace it?

/Petition I lost a backpack full of bonechips, can you please check the 
logs and replace it?

/Petition I lost my corpse that had a leather tunic and banded bracer and 
cloth sandels, can you check the logs and replace it please?

/Petition I had a Sword_of_Uberness on my level 3 corpse, and it rotted.  
Can you please replace it?

/Petition I had a Dragoon Dirk in my range slot and threw it.  Can you 
please check the logs and replace it?

Basically, the goal is to make it so that the only people who will 
petition for it are people who lost something pretty much irreplacable.
