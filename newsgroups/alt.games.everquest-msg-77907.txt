Hey, its not completely negative. It DOES improve zone times
drastically. And I have no idea what it does to old world zone
framerates, not having left luclin lately. All I am saying is before
changing useumbra my framerates were fair to bad in many luclin zones,
now after changing it some zones have suffered massive declines and
none of them are particularly good.

FWIW though

500 celeron (the cause of the bad framerates to begin with of course)
384 mb
32 mb geforce 2 gts
W98 FE

Reiterated; I commented on the change between putting the line in and
beforehand. I'm well aware my CPU is barely up to the task of running
EQ at all.
