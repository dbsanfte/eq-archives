From their website:
https://store.station.sony.com/eq_char_moves/
When moving characters between accounts, billing information must be
identical on both accounts and you must be the original owner of both
accounts. You may use the credit card on file or submit a different credit
card using the Billing Information fields. If the credit card holder is
different from the holder of the card on file, please enter a short
explanation in the bottom field. If you have only paid for your account with
a Game Card, you must submit a credit card using the Billing Information
fields.

If you attempt to transfer characters in violation of these guidelines and
restrictions, any laws, the EUASL or the Rules of Conduct(for instance,
attempting to transfer characters from another person's account or to or
from an account purchased by or for you or given to you where you are not
the original registered user of that account), the characters will not be
moved, your request will not be processed or approved and your account(s)
will be subject to review and appropriate disciplinary action taken.

So I think you are Shadows of Luclin (SoL).
