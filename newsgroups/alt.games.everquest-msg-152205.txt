Hi all,

I am coming back to EQ after being away for a little over a year.  When I
last played I had bought the Trilogy (EQ/RoK/SoV).  I installed it and began
to DL the expansion patches.  I soon realized this would take awhile and
since I wanted to play an Erudite I bypassed the expansion DL's figuring I
would get them later on.
    Tonight I reactivated my account and arrived at the character creation
screen and this time figured I would play an Iksar.  I selected Iksar, and
of course it told me I could not play one until I got the expansion.  My
problem:  I don't see any buttons to DL expansion patches and info.
Furthermore, It tells me that I don't have any expansions registered.  The
Trilogy pack has one account key that I of course registered to open the
account.  So then, now I am confused.  I thought I should have the Kunark
and Velious info installed (with the Trilogy). Only thing I can think of is
I have to DL the expansion files but there is no longer an option to do so.
Any help would be appreciated.
