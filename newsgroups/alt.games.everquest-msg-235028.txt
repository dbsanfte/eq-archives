Nope. This is a standard recipe.  You've got 3 sizes of Clay Jars.  They 
are Small, Medium, and Large.  The Unfired Container version for all 
three is listed in the Pottery Wheel UI list.  But in the Kiln list only 
the recipes for Small and Large Clay jars are listed.  You can create 
Medium Clay Jars but they do not show up, even after creation, on the 
Matching Recipe List.  In order to make them you have to continue to use 
the original interface, now called Experiment.

In-game most people seem to only use those lower level recipes to level 
up.   Had I followed one of the 'How to level quickly' methods with the 
Pottery Skill, I would have never messed with the Kiln firing step.  It 
is listed as requiring about half the skill level as the Pottery Wheel 
step.

My guess is their internal tester just missed the Kiln step.  There will 
probably be more examples of recipes that should have made the list but 
are missing.
