Correct.  When they decide a given quest should not be MQable, they
make it so you can't MQ that quest.  For example, the Staff of the
Wheel quest is not MQable, because rather than giving the 10 items to
the quest giver, the quest giver gives you a no drop container, and
you have to put the 10 no drop items into the container and combine
them.
