Yes, it is. "thx" and "pls" don't save a notable amount of
time/typing. "sow" does. There's a line between shorthand and
laziness. Saving 12 letters is shorthand. Saving 2-3 is laziness.
There's also the fact that "sow" doesn't have the dubious association
with the hyperactive hacker-wannabe jargon.
