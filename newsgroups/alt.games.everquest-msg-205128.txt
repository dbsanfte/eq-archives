Was hunting bandits trying to get some safety faction for my Ikky Warrior
yesterday and noticed when fighting the Bandit Wizards (Half Elf Males) that
their AC seems to be overly high...like, at 16th level I was often hitting
for 1pnt, I mean hit after hit would be for 1pnt...with the occasional 9pnt
and the (very) rare mid teen hit. Most of these are Green, some are Cyan yet
it was like I was attacking a mob twice my level than one 4 levels and more
lower.
A while ago these guys possessed more than 7k in HP's and I think their AC
is still out of proportion in a similar manner. As a comparison I took down
the "baby" werewolf in WK, he's yellow to me and I finished that fight with
75% health...One Wizard bandit took longer to kill leaving me with less
health.
