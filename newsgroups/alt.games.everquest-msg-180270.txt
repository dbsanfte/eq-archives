   Well, it went live on Test today for those who had played on
Test in the last 3 weeks and had given a valid email address to
Sony.   Some of us in the AGE guild have access.  Unfortunately,
pretty much as soon as we found out about this, Test went down
for eta of two hours (while I make a nice spot of cash camping
the Aqua goblins, damnit!).  Still, a couple of people had rolled
up froglok clerics and such.  Also, in order to get in, the beta
testers had to agree to a nondisclosure Agreement.  I don't know
how much info will spill over into the newsgroup because of this.
   I find it interesting that this beta testing is taking place,
what, two weeks before the expansion goes live?  How many bugs
can the Testies find, and the developers fix, in that short of a
time?

Annie
