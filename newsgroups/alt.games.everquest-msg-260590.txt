You and Ben Sisson are beginning to sound a lot like each other. I'd say 
something at this point about "strange bedfellows" but the imagery that 
invokes is just too wierd to continue.

In my view, worlds alone -- while compelling and necessary -- aren't enough 
to sustain my interest. Life itself demands more than mere existence. Call 
me competitive or driven, or whatever, but I can't feel satisfied unless I'm 
able to produce and achieve and I take great personal satisfaction from my 
accomplishments. Not just because of what they bring me but also out of a 
sense that I've contributed to something greater than any of us. That's why 
I thought DAoC was going to be so exciting. The concept of making a 
difference in the world is exciting and is one of the things that has drawn 
many to greatness throughout history. Give me an MMORPG that gives me a 
world and at the same time gives me the opportunity to make a difference and 
to achieve great things for my people, and I'm so there.
