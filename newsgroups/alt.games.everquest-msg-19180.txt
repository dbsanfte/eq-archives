Tizmaks in Great Divide.  You'll want a group still for a level or two,
but by your low 30s its possible to go in deep and pull large quantities
of the better ones.

Loot?  Not fantastic, but you'll see lots of velium weapons that sell for
10pp each back in EC, and Tizmak armor pieces that sell likewise,
plus the occaisional Cured Tizmac that goes for 200pp.  If you have
a tracker in your group you can also pull down Yaka a couple times
a day for his 400pp drop weapon, the Velium Etched Stone Mace,
although if you aren't twinked out, you'll want to keep  that for yourself
for a while.

You can also go after Drakkal Dire wolves with a partner, or Frost
Giant Scouts with a group.  Kodiaks are popular, but I always
found myself getting killed when a nearby Quad Kiter dropped the
ball.

As a cleric, you don't need to look so much for things you can handle,
as for things your group can handle.  If you want loot, get a partner
who can handle -real- mobs.   At 32 you can group with someone
up to level 46 and still get exp.  Yes, your share of the exp pie won't
be large there, but if you are getting 50% of the loot that the level
46 guy is earning, you'll be pretty happy.  Depending on his class
you should be able to speed his kills per hour up three to five times
even at your disparate levels, a great deal for him in terms of exp
(you'll hardly steal any) and not bad for loot... as half of four times
the loot is still twice what he'd get solo.

Funny thing is, if he kills something green to him, you get -all- the exp,
and at his level that stuff may still be red to you!
