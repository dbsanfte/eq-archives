First Race War on Rallos Zek:

My first real character was a troll shaman on the Rallos Sek server.
At that time, I didn't know a damn thing about the lay of the land at
all. All my characters up that point had been totally confined to
newbie zones. I had made a human character in freeport at one point,
but I had absolutley no clue how to to travel from freeport to grobb,
or vice versa. I didn't even really have an idea of how many zones
were between these locations. The southern ro desert was a scary
inhospitable place full of red cons, and us newbies didn't go there.
The world was a big scary place back when we were all under level 10.
That was a time when the most common auction heard was:

/auc WTS Mino axe!! 5pp  Best 1 hand slash weapon in game!!!!

Anyway, on this particular day, rumors had been circulating all over
the swamp zone of a massive raid on Freeport. All dark races were
being encouraged to march on Freeport and slay all the lighties they
could find. Eventually, there was a mob of about 40 of us newbie
trolls ready to march out, the only problem was nobody knew how to get
to freeport! After much searching, one helpful guy announced that he
could lead us to Freeport, and there was much rejoicing.

The marauding band of trolls set out through the Southern desert of
ro. Imagine if you will, a mass of 40 rank newbies stumbling along,
most of them completely clueless about anything, bumbling through a
zone they've never seen. After about half an hour, we had managed to
move the majority of the "raid" up to the oasis of ro zone line. We
should have turned back then, but we didn't.

Once we entered the Oasis, our helpful guide informed us that the way
to get through the zone, was to follow the left zone wall around, and
keep following the left wall north until the next zone. For those who
don't know, this route will take you through an area known as "the orc
highway". Well, at the time, none of us dumbass trolls had ever heard
of "orc highway" so we cheerfully followed our guides advice, and
marched off.

Well, it didn't take long before some members of the raid strayed too
close to some wandering orcs, and aggroed them. These poor
unfortunates then stared running to the raid mass to try get help,
thereby agroing the orcs onto all the other members of the raid. Some
people in the raid tried to help fight the orcs, some others tried to
run on, some others just ran around like headless chickens screaming
and /yelling. The slaughter didn't take very long. Our entire raid
force was wiped out by a bunch of level 12ish orcs in moments.

Later, as I searched for my corpse amongst the 40 or so other troll
bodies, I couldn't help but wonder if this event would change the
freeport guards opinion of orcs in general. After all, shouldn't those
city guards be grateful to the orcs for ambushing our assault?

P.S.

The great Rallos Zek race war did eventually take place, and it was
certainly an EQ first. The war started between mostly Dark elves and
humans, but as word spread the other reaces started joining the fight.
I can still remember the shouts when our troll/ogre force eventually
recovered, and arrived in North freeport. People were screaming " HOLY
SHIT!!! THE OGRES HAVE LANDED!!!"  "60 OGRES ON THE BEACH RUN FOR YOUR
LIVES!!!!" "THIS IS NOT A DRILL!!!" Then our band rushed through the
tunnel to east commonlands at the perfect time to reinforce our DE
brethren who were being forced back into nektulos. It was beautiful.
This horde of monsters swooping down on the backs of the lighties
trying to blockade our DE allies. I recall at one point there was
hundreds of people fighting in East commonlands. It got so intense,
the zones started crashing. We had like the entire population of the
server packed into just a few zones killing each other, it was great.
The battle swayed back and forth, sometimes with lighties advancing
into nektulos, at another time with the darkies falling back from east
freeport into the freeport sewers to regroup before attacking again.
It was truly epic, and I've been playing PvP EQ ever since.
