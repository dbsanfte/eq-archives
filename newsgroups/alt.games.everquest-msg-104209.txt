I hate to say it, but many drop in LOIO and get sold to Nubs in the windmill
or even to vendors in FV.  That's a good place to find words if you can
handle the AOL-chat room atmosphere that resides in LOIO.  SK is another
place to find them.  Mainly at the vendor in the top of the birdhouse.  His
name is Krak something-or-other.

Good luck,
Sean...
