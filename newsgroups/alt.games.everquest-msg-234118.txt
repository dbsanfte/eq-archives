I gotta echo 6 as much as anything ... When I first got LDoN and started
running, I knew there was a lot I didn't know, ya know, but when I was
asking in my first few parties, nobody knew or deigned to answer me [
questions like 'who is going to pull?' and 'Instead of running into that new
room full of evil things with sharp nasty teeth, why don't we just pull them
into this nice clear room we are in?' ]

I had to learn, and am still learning, a lot but found for myself that it
was simpler to just assume command of the party from the start - I am VERY
good running 6 or 8 windows so recuit very well and that will get other
people impressed - and even though I am not THAT experienced in EQ, am an
old hand at gaming in general and so certain priciples, like mobility,
intel, and isolation of the enemy indvidually to defeat in detail translate
rather well...

but by assuming authority, trying get these concepts across carried more
weight, and just as important, as party leader I picked who played ...
within a short time I rarely was in a group that didn't have at least three
others I had grouped with before...  That is the single biggest help to any
party - you know each others moves...

Don't pet strange dogs, and don't team with five complete strangers unless
you are willing to say 'Hey!  I just realized!  You guys SUCK - I am outta
here!'
