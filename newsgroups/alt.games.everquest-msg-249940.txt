Dear Guild and Community Representatives,

Thanks you very much for a great Summit! By all accounts it was a huge
success. I can speak for the EverQuest Development Team and tell you
that we're all grateful for the input you provided. In fact, in trying
to generate this list to give to you this evening, we realized there
was so much to go over that we wouldn't be able to get a complete list
togather in time. We're committed to not only listening to your
feedback, but working with you to make EverQuest more enjoyable for
yours to come.

So, we decided to list the Top Ten themes we would address starting
Monday, as well as the most common themes that we'll come back with
more information on by mid-week next week.

A quick discussion resulted in a list of items that we will immediatly
address:

-Add scripting to shut off empty instances of Plane of Time
-Raid message of the day
-Improving how we handle beta and the testing process
-Increase the number of debuffs allowed on MOBs
-Increase buffs on players thru AA's
-Note field on raid window
-Improved consent & drag for raid, group and guild
-Improve corpse drag radius
-Make charms not no-drop
-Guild and individual rewards for guild beta testing
-Work on larger To Do List... I know this is a little random

Future items we will immediately begin looking at and discussing are
as follows:

-Plane of Time instancing and other issues
-back flagging solutions to help with high end guild atrophy
-Improve raid and guild functionality
-Auto loot all for your corpse
-Improvements to Raid XP
-No more alien NPC's (focusing more on familiar norrathian themes)
-Solo LDoN-Style instances or similar content
-Issues with item augmentations
-Possible enhancement to Guild Wars

Of course these aren't all of the itmes. You brought us a CD, 2 Books,
20 printed sheets of a manifesto. We'll need to go through all of
those and our notes before we can really get a good tally of all of
the wonderful ideas and questions that were presented.

Thank you again for your feedback and participation. We've had a
greatd weekend and a wonderful display of things to come.

Sincerely,
EverQuest Development Team

"Bad enough when the dead come walking," he said to Jon as they crossed
 the village, "now the Old Bear wants them talking as well? No good will
 come of *that*, I'll warrant. And who's to say the bones wouldn't lie?
 Why should death make a man truthful, or even clever? The dead are likely
 dull fellows, full of tedious complaints - 'the ground's too cold, my
 gravestone should be larger, why does *he* get more worms than I do....'"
