Saturday morning in the early A.M. on the Stromm server I got a hill
giant rooted next to my 35 necro while I was AFK sitting on the zone
wall. This was done by a 50 ranger named Lilluilya that said "oops, it
was an accident. It wouldn't have happened if you hadn't KSed me."

The only other contact with her was on a previous pull when I sent my
pet to attack, with taunt turned off, and the hill giant started to
beat on my pet. I then cast my snare and the giant turned and started
to follow me. I cast my DOTs and kept pulling it to the zone wall.
Durring this pull the ranger runs over, get's in my face then starts
to beat on the hill giant. At no time did she get agro and I got the
experience. I did not cast anything other than DOTs. No DD spells. 

Is it possibe for a 35 necro that has his pet not taunting KS a 50
ranger to the point that the ranger never gets agro while the ranger
beats on the mob full speed?

The only thing I can think of is that the ranger didn't see the skelly
melee the hill giant and fired an arrow. This would not get agro if
the pet had done enough damage before the arrow was fired.

That must have been Lilluilya of Tribal X on the Stromm server's
reason to kill an AFK person sitting on the canyon wall. Then to laugh
about it afterwards.
