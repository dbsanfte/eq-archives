I have a female iksar necro.  She is quiet, and most people think she is a
he.  But then, it is easy to think that with an iksar.  I have to point out
that she is female most of the time.  I don't think I actually meant to
create a female iksar when I created her.  It does make it a bit less
painful to wear the bathrobe-of-the-Oracle though. That dang robe is just
too pretty for my tastes...  Necros should not be allowed to wear that one
IMO, but if they do they should at least be a female  ; )
