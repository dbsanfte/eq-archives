Hrm... your logic is bad....
Even being client side based the server could be aware of your status...
simply have the client tell the server that it has entered "Zoning" from X
to Y.
Then the server knows where you are... you're Zoning... and you'll be in Y
soon.
When the client shows up, have it tell the server, "Look at me! I've just
shown up in Y from X!"

This is a very simple idea and would need some debugging/trapping added of
course but you get the idea...
