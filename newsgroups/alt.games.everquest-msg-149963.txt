Right, *game* settings (color preferences, hotkeys, window
layout, etc.) are all stored locally and have nothing to do with
the "charactername saved" messages.

*Character* settings (equipment, spells in the spellbook,
cash, stuff in the bank, skills, level, etc.) are all stored
remotely on Verant's computers (mostly to keep people from
hacking their character and giving themselves maxed level/skill/plat
which would be possible if they were stored on each player's
computer), and *that's* the information that is getting
saved to disk (in California) when you get the "so-and-so saved"
message.

In short, if you can change it at will, it's stored on your
computer.  If you have to "earn" it in-game, it's stored on
Verant's computers.
