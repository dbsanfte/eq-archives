*giggle* My first and only time doing that was maybe a week before I quit.
I figured if I could tank dark masters that elysians would be a piece of
cake.  Somehow we ended up with a full group to help one druid get her
tunic, with about 3 pre-10th-level halfling druids sitting around us.  We
divvied up the camps with the 2 other druid groups doing it and proceeded
to pull ours in groups of 4-5 at a time.  It was a hoot, and my poor druid
friend...well, she hadn't grouped much. And certainly not the kind where
you pull 4-5 at once and keep them all root parked.  She kept going OOM
trying to heal me, nevermind that they barely touched me. I finally broke
down and told her that when a 56 druid is grouped with a 65 ranger/shaman
team, all she needs to do is toss in an occasional nuke and otherwise just
keep us company.  

I felt like such a "big kid" that day. ^_^

Yes, but you still made it fun to read about.
