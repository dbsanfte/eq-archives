Rants about CS of Verant is not very helpful here and that you can't cope
with a simple loss is really just your own problem.

If you weren't capable of controlling your "addiction" then you have/had a
problem. As opposed to you and your friend most of us actually do have lives
next to EQ. It's just the "sitting mindlessly in front of telly", "chatting
on irc" and such which is replaced by playing a good interactive game. I
still go out, visit parties, watch my favorite tv-shows and the news and
sleep well enough, all next to going to work 5 days a week.


And keep the religious indoctrination away from me please.

good war in Eastern Wastes last night.
