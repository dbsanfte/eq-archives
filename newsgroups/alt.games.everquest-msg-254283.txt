This isn't exactly right.  /defensive alters the DI of a mob by 50%,
hence if for instance you have a mob with DB of say 50 and DI of 100 your
range of hits would go from 51 to 1950. with defensive that would be from
51 to 1000, with the hits being clustered dependent on the ATK/AC ratio
of the mob vs the tank.   If the mobs DB is 100 and the DI 50 you'd go
from 101 to 1001. /def 101 to 485.  The SteelWarrior has a nice rule of 
thumb that I can't recall where if the DB/DI ratio of a mob is > .3 or
something use evasive, otherwise /defensive.  This also gets modified if
the mob in question has some sort of evil proc of some nature that would
get further mitigated by missing.

/def really, typically "smoothes" out spikey damage and makes heal chains
work pretty well.  Dependant on mob getting 1 rounded under /eva is much
greater.
