You want a group? Change your name to something people can type, I know this
is a role playing game, but when it is hard to read a name and then
translate that into typing it correctly, if I can't get it in 1 or 2 tries I
stop.
If you truely want to group, then you need to start your own group, shout
group looking for more even if you are solo, turn on the looking for people
in the LFG tool even when solo.
Worst case start over with a group oriented character (I might consider
going to the newest server since there are true newbies as well as twinks
galore there).
Mages are one of the best grouping characters as well as a decent soloer.
Change guilds, get online do /who all 28 35 and see what guilds there are
then start doing /who all guildname and see how many people are on, then
talk to some of them.
