No key is required for Disco (sometimes called Disco1 and Disco2)

The only locked door is into crypt (4 doors, whatever).. which is rogue
pickable.  The rest have another method or trick to get into (e.g on the way
to Trak)

No key is required anywhere in Seb, aside from the key you used to zone in
with.
