I thought that was sort of the point of the Zeks.

For those who think that defeating a raid spawn isn't enough...for 
people who want the added challenge of fending off rival guilds in pvp 
combat while they're at it, for people who figure the camp should go to 
the player able to hold it, not the player who got there first... etc. 
For people who want to settle a dispute by the sword, not an ooc bitch 
fest followed by a petition to gm to arbitrate...

(yeah yeah I know eq has numerous mechanics issues that make PvP 
unabalanced... but still ...my first few chars were on R.Zek... I wanted 
that world myself, until it became apparent how buggered pvp was, and 
how little SoE cared to fix it. :)
