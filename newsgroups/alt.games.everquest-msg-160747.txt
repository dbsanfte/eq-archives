Well historically whenever a new set comes out the expansion is sold for a
short period standalone to allow current users to get into the new section
and then fairly rapidly the next generation of 'Gold'/'Trilogy' version
comes out with all expansion in it bar the latest usually. 

When I bought Kunark and played for a while I ended up going to Singapore
to find a Scars of Velious standalone becuase by that time Velious was
merged into the trilogy pack and had been so in the UK for along time.

Expect, very soon, the trilogy to do a Hitchhikers Guide routine and
include SoL and not so far away to complete the Douglas Adams scenario.
