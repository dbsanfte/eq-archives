Thanks. But I'll probably still be hanging around here now and again.
It's a good community, for the most part, and since I plan to return to
Norrath I'd like to keep up on the latest developments. Besides, I have
to have something to occupy my time at work. *grin*

She was actually the catalyst for this decision. When I mentioned the
*possibility* of stopping for a while, her immediate response was "I'd
have quit already if I didn't enjoy playing with you so much and saw how
much you enjoyed it."  Unfortunately, I've come to "enjoy" it the same
way cocaine addicts enjoy the next fix.

Thanks for the good thoughts, Jim.
