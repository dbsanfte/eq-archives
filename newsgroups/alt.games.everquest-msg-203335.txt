Nothing destroys the immersion factor more than camping and lists to
get into camps. Traditionally the popular dungeons in EQ have been
"take a number" to get a group, and then sit in one spot and hold a
camp until the named mob with the item you want pops. There has always
been very little "crawling " in EQ. Then there is the issue with other
players/groups training your camp, or people making a nuisance of
themselves in OOC or Shout.

Now contrast that with the less popular dungeons. You know, the ones
where you can take a single group or two and have it all to
yourselves. Some of the best times I have had in EQ have been with
small groups actually crawling through an otherwise empty dungeon.

I really don't think you have to have to "deal" with crowds in order
to experience EQs MMORPG aspects. In fact if done right the new
dungeon expansion could be great for meeting people. You form a pickup
group outside the dungeon, then head inside and have your own instance
to crawl through. I really look forward to the new expansion,
especially if it's done right.
