It's sad that there are people like you in this world. Pity that natural
selection has been fucked up so bad to prevent a bigger stronger person
from snapping your weak little neck and ridding us all of you. I guess
it just goes to show you that you have to buy an SUV to ensure your
continued plight on us all where as the more brave will risk it since as
you put it we all cannot control our destiny yet you feel a bigger car
will some how prevent it from happening.

In closing you are a fuckhead and if I had the oppertunity to run into
you in real life I would not hesitate for a second to take a baseball
bat across your knees and your fancy SUV and has you laid there crying
like a little bitch I would remind you that regardless the size of your
car danger lurks around every corner and you are not more important then
everyone else to allow you to put others at risk for your own protection
you fucking little coward.
