Lets try this:

Get a spellchecker.  Your statement has been around for quite a while, 
and typing really badly only makes you look like a noob who never took 
english.
------------------------------
I forget the name of the law, but its been observed that every spelling 
flame contains its own spelling error.

All a spell checker does is assure that every word you type is -a- 
correctly spelled word, not that the words are the correct words to 
convey your meaning, not that they are gramatically correct.

And lets not overlook the fact that they also don't assure that your 
entire point makes any sense at all.

Nothing personal, I already replied to your post the way I meant to, but 
on seeing RJB's comment, I just felt the need to go back and hit ReDo!
