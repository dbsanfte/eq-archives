You are right about it being a "feature" of XP.  Alot of people have 
posted to other boards about this problem.
I'd direct you to the 0.verizon groups but you can't access those unless 
you are on a verizon connection.

Try a google search, might come up with the fix for it.  I don't know 
the fix, I do know that it can be turned off.

Keep looking, you'll find it.
