Am I doing this right? $10 per month X 12 months X 2.5 years = 300 bucks 
for a level 13 char - surely you can find something on eBay higher than 
that?  Say a level 25 with some bandit gear. ;p

Seriously.  I level EXTREMELY slow, but since starting sometime in 2001, 
I've managed to get 2 chars to 40, one to 35, and numerous others in 
their teens.
