And they make up for it by being insanely powerful soloers.  OTOH, my
paladin can barely solo light blues, but is very useful in groups.  It's a
trade off.  Are you saying that druids should be able to solo like madmen,
AND be good grouping characters, AND be able to teleport?

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
