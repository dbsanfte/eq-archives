If these lock ups have started after you installed the new memory, may be
due to fault on the new stick, try removing it and see how it goes. Also, of
late, I have also been suffering lock ups when connection fails but only
when running Win XP Home edt. ( Connection can still drop as 70% of UK
connections still are redirected to the US through a Main Backbone pipeline
based in Holland which is chronicallly oversubscribed )
