    Interesting name. Soviet special forces shaman? ;-)

    Then go Shadel Bandit ring or Valorium Ring of Gallantry. Both fairly
cheap, both help out with the relatively small mana pool you have.

    You really should rethink the horse thing. A FT 20 item for 10 K should
be a no-brainer, especially since it stops the annoying need to bounce up
and down with Canni to catch med ticks. Clicking off the buff to run if
needed isn't as bad as you might think, unless you're multiboxing. Then you
might want to hotkey the /dismount command, and avoid annoying zones like
Earth where dismounting doesn't always dismount you.

    Other items to consider: new earring, like a Bloodmetal Earring of
Engagement, for the 60 HP one. Blue-diamond cultural bracers to replace the
two you have now, both of which are weak slots. An alternate belt - haste
doesn't affect how many times you proc per unit time, and I assume you melee
more for the proc than for the DPS. My shaman has a Belt of Dripping Bile -
there's a lot of belts in that quality range to which you could switch. I
wouldn't recommend going to the Vindi BP, especially since some of your
guildmates might still want one, but Vindi's boots would make a nice
drama-free upgrade.

    The reason I suggest pool upgrades more than HP upgrades is this: your
shaman is capable of killing some really big prey if you ever need to farm
good stuff. But to do that he'll need pool, especially since you lack the
two big free damage sources other shamans have (JBB, Epic). Since Canni
always involves taking more HPs than it gives back mana, it makes sense to
give up some of your "soft" (STA-based) HPs now to get an equal amount of
mana. It also makes sense given that you'll be getting ten more STA when you
hit level 62. :-) You're lucky that you have PE, by the way - I've been
having a devil of a time finding either the spell or the words/pages to
research it. And I've found the pages adventuring to research some other
rarer spells, like 59 NEC pet, KEI, mage 60 pet heal, etc.
