Ok. Just researched the enchanter level 16 AoE mez spell,
Mesmerisation yesterday and immediately tried it out in Paludal
Caverns in a bandit group. Was resisted the three times I tried. I
have no trouble landing the level four spell, Mesmerise at any time
with rare exceptions. Yet every time I cast Mesmerisation on one of
the mobs in the pull, I get the "The spell did not take hold." message
for each mob.

My chanter is a human with only 119 CHA, but the CHA theories have
been debunked time and time again in this group. What the heck is
wrong with this spell or the way I'm using it?

Any ideas appreciated.
