I could do with a few wise words about Cleric armour at lower 
levels, I have already made the mistake of buying leather for
my Druid when I had the plat and ending up at lvl 9 with no 
money to buy spells! :-))

At the momen at lvl 8 with my High Elf Cleric I am sticking 
with a motley assortment of armour and relying on Courage, Holy
Armour and Yaulp.   So do I work up or do I wait until I can
afford chain mail.  I am also worried about the weight with
a High Elf. 

There are probably a lot of other things I have`nt even thought
of.

BTW do I keep max` ing out 1HB and 2HB or stick to one?
