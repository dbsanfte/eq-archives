One day I crossed the zone line from Southern Plains of Karana to North and
found guards standing at the end of bridge who are not all that friendly.  I
can bypass them by jmping in the water and swim around it but it is a
different story to come back.  I need to ran on to and across the bridge
where guard is standing.  Will they attack me?  Is there a other way back?

Emilio.
