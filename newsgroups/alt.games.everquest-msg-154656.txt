I went to the entrance to the Hole to complete pick lock skill..
sadly, Befallen followed by the Hole is sufficient to do so
on a bard, who then has an almost entirely useless skill.

I've never worked on Disarm Traps, but I've heard that Echo
Caverns is a very popular spot for this, as is Sol A.  As a
side note, would bard DT be as useless as bard PL?

Llyric, 40 Vah Shir Bard, 100 Pick Lock Skill, I'm SOOOO uber
