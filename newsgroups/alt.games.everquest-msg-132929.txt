I don't have access to a Cox NNTP server.  I'll be happy to check it out 
tho if you setup SSH and forward port 119 to me.

I think it's skilled enough, and Google is just the tip of the iceberg.  
But thanks for caring.

I think I'm entitled to not have to always fight with people who want 
nothing more than to strip away my rights.  But that's not the way it 
goes.

I don't fancy myself anything, that is what sheep do when they herd 
themselves into pens.  But I do have my opinions, some conservative, some 
not.  No benefits to YOU perhaps.  But obviouslly to someone, as it 
exsists, and seems to get traffic.  What are the drawbacks exactly of you 
just IGNORING the exsistance of anything you don't like?  Oh, the 
exclusive ability to whine, bitch, moan, and impose your will on others.  
Have fun with that.
