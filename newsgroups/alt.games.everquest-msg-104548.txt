That is so totally fucking stupid I don't know where to begin.
Anything taken to extremes can be bad, ANYTHING!

Do you think maybe that kid had a 'few' mental problems?
EQ was just this kid's particular catalyst, it could have been anything.

Do casinos have warning labels on addictiveness?
Alcohol Products? Bars? Strip clubs? Candy Bars?
Role Playing games? Other computer games? Sports?

I had a friend in high school that was so into chess his school work
and friendships suffered because of it. He subscribed to 7 chess
magazines, belonged to 2 clubs and was playing in 10 pbm chess
tournaments at one time. He ate, drank, breathed and slept chess. I finally
said something to his parents, his mother poo-pooed it but his father listened
to me and got him some help. See any warning labels on any chess boards?

Take some fucking responsibility for your own actions or that
of your children.
