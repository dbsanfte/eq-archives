Yup.  I don't think there is any scanner out there that consistently catches
everything.  What's sad is that neither Norton nor McAfee are consistently
in the top, but because they are the market leaders, people believe they
must be good.  One of the products where I work is a scanner that uses an
engine that consistently beats both Norton and McAfee, and we actually get
complaints from people when our free trial version (which scans to report
problems, but does not automatically fix them) finds things that Norton or
McAfee miss!  If Norton doesn't report it, the user thinks, it can't be
real, so we must be lying to try to scare them into buying our full version!

And then, when Norton gets updated and reports the virus, the user says that
*we* must have put it there when they downloaded our free trial!
Geesh...sometimes you just can't win. :-)
