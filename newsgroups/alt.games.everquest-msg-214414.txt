Just the way the game works. Just pratice sneak while you are running
somewhere. You will notice you slow down when you are successful. You will
also notice you aren't successful a lot.

The good thing about sneak is once you have it going, it stays on. Since it
only works when you are behind something, you just keep moving behind them
if they turn to face you.

With hide you always want to /con something that is anything but indifferent
to you just to be sure. You can hide in front of NPCs. As someone else said,
you have to remain still.

No, because camo is a great way to travel fast or med/heal in a dangerous
area. Works against most monsters your level except for undead. After a
tough fight, cast camo before you med and you won't be bothered while
sitting down.
