It's not except in a few places, the big thing is that invis works here on
just about everything except some spiders and puslings, and inside the
castle.

Yeah, I do the same thing, and I still have trouble getting a goddamn frog

Yeah, but more information = good.

Actually I don't think I ever got a resist on WD, so with it and my bracer,
about 20 minutes per kill, I didn't have a horse at the time either, and
only FT1 (earring), plus KEI and the mana regen wolf form at 54.  Definitely
had to resnare.

I got all of mine solo except for the arms, which a friend called me in to
loot when I was level 60 and he was whacking elysians while I was farming
goranga in ME.  It took exactly 24 kills to get my bp, and by then I had
gotten gloves (banked), legs, boots, crown x3 (banked, rotted,
random_twink08), and finally the tunic.  Never got bracers to drop, but
they're shit incarnate anyways.  I did go back once and have a party with 4
druids and a cleric at one point, we killed fast, and whacked the corrupted
elysian (grats mr. cleric on the mask).  Of course now I just go and scare
the shit out of anyone in the valley by soloing the corrupted elysian and
spamming everyone with "Corrupted Elysian Elder says "You will not evade me
Aluaeia!".  Then they ask me what it dropped and I giggle irl.

Really, stat-wise I should wear the tunic, but I'm too lazy to take off my
thurg bp (also soloable, though it takes guts, and a LOT more time than
elysian;  I estimate that I could get 10 full suits of elysian per thurg BP
that I get, which has been all of 2, one plate, one chain, but them and the
lesser pieces financed my bp mq.)
