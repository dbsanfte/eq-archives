Guess I should state this here too, as I did on The Shaman's Crucible.
In retrospect I should have clipped the GM's address.  My intention
was/is not to cause this person any grief.  I don't want to wind up
reprimanded for posting her address on top of losing my epic.

I only intended to try to plead my case and at the very least help
others avoid the same problem I had.



Sidenote:  A poster on The Shamans Crucible tells me now that 2 of his
guildmates got their tears, repeated several of the steps to faction
up and got their epics on the 11th, 1 day after my failure.  I am
totally confused, totally frustrated, and just feel sick.
