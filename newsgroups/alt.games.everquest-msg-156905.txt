Does anyone know if the grimlings in grimling forest are affected by harmony
now? Those camps are huge, and if harmony doesn't work, i don't see how
anyone can pull from it and survive. With the casters, feign death doesn't
work. Maybe you need a raid size group to take the camp now? If they are
still affected, i can think of a number of camps (dark elves in lesser
faydark) that I've never attempted but been interested in, that I would only
touch if harmony worked?

I think that making a higher level version of the spell if fair, or, if it
really is too powerful, why did they have it in the game at all? At 10th
level fighting orcs in the commons, harmony was essential (unless some high
level wandered by to break the camp), but what tactics can a bunch of 50th
level characters facing a camp of 45th level guys (with casters to kill any
feign puller) use?
