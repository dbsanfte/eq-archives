No but if he's new to newsgroups why not read the info on posting to
newsgroups provided by most ISP's that actually do mention the etiquette
of posting to alt.test to test your newservers setup.

Yes my signature probably is rather large, am I going to change it no. 
My point was that Bonda got ripped on for basically telling someone
where to post there test messages.  Yes he was offensive about it, but
after a while you get sick of telling people over and over and over.
