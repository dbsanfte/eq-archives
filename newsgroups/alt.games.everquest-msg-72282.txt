    Compared to WE druids, yes.  Oh, I don't doubt that
there
are alot of WE rangers.  After all, the only other ranger
choices
are Half Elf and Human.  Human rangers, of course, are the
"so
very rare" variety of which you speak.  
   But really...go to any zone, any one at all, and do a
/who
druid and then a /who ranger.  Wait...that won't, because
most
druids and rangers (post 30, anyways) go anon.  Ok, go to
every
wood elf in the zone, and ask what their occupation is. 
Just
for kicks, do the same with every half elf.
   Wood-elf rangers are much rarer than druids.
