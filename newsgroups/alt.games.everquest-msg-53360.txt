Try this, just as below (with modifications):

/sit off
/pause 40,/cast 7
/sit on 
(or /book <page number> if you really need to go to the 
book after rather than simply sit)
 
 Be aware the /pause time is in 10ths of a second and you 
will need to pause for slightly longer than the spell cast
time.
 
 And yes, the /pause HAS to go first and on the same line
exactly as I put it.
 
 Good luck.
