At 40, I have these spells usually up:
Complete Heal
Superior heal
<Buff swap>
<buff swap>
Resusitate (70% of the time)
Stun or undead nuke or root
Wrath (best general DD)
Gate

I use F1-F6 to target party members. I prefer the head tank to be F2,
simply because that's where he usually is. If I'm in a group and he's
moved, I get annoyed, and can't find him as fast. My keyboard splits
between F4 and F5, so the last two folks I have to think before hitting
that key.

My hotkeys are set up to be as consistent as possible between all of my
characters.

1 Where
/loc
/doabilty 1 (sense heading)

2 Attack (and yes, i still use sometimes!)
/attack
/say By Brell's beard %T shall die!
/loc
/doability 1

3 Assist
/assist (autoattack should be turned off)
/doability 1
/loc

4 Sit
The button from the main menu. Pre-35, it opened my book and made me
med. I'm keeping a sit button here, so I don't CTL-D my party.

5 Light
/g Trying for a lighter healing touch for %T
/cast 2
/doability 1
/cast 2 (for some reason, doability adds enough of a pause so if cast
one fizzles, 2 will get off)

6 Heal
/g Healing %T be patient.
/cast 1
/doability 1
/cast 1

7 On Me
/g Somebody is eating the Cleric! Get it off!
/say ON ME!!
/doability 1
/loc

8 Guild
(lists my guildmates)

9 Auction
whatever I am selling

0 Panic
/g RUN! RUN! RUN!
/g I am' running for the zone like a scared little girl!
/g Y'all come too!
/g Run! Run! Run!
/loc

This means when I am grouped, I hit three keys to heal. Fx, 4, 6. Then 4
when it goes off, or cast again.

Obviously, make the interface whatever seems most logical to you.
