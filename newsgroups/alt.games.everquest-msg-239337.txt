It is.   When my Rogue was the uber level of 15 or 16, she had a slashing
proc'ing weapon in her off hand.   Due to having about a 20 dual wield
skill, it barely ever got swung at the mob.  In the string of 15 pierce
attempts, without a slash attempt in sight, was the message "Your will is
not sufficient to wield this weapon."    She had a proc without even
attempting to hit the mob.
