Well... they are...

Main Entry: 2oc7cult 
Function: adjective 
Etymology: Latin occultus, from past participle of 
occulere to cover up, from ob- in the way + -culere (akin to celare to 
conceal) --more at OB- 
1 : not revealed : SECRET 
2 : not easily apprehended or
understood : ABSTRUSE, MYSTERIOUS 
3 : hidden from view : CONCEALED

All it really means is, they are things not everybody knows about.  And 
the Silmarillion fits definition #2 -quite- well. :)

Of course, they've both gotten a whole lot less occult in recent years.
