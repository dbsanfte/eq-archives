I had Evolution, LDoN, and God when I got Titanium. It added the OoW,
DoN, DoD expansions to my account.  When I did the /claim for it (the
satchel filled with everything) it worked even though I had the
satchel and the GoD staff already. My gnome enchanter has 2 of them
actually. IIRC I was 'dual wielding' them one time. Again, IIRC, I was
told by a eqlive forum 'mod' that you can't have to of the same items
from claim on 1 account. Guess I'm exploiting the game. Lol!
