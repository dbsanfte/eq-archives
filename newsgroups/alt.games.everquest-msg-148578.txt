}Is it doable solo?

Is what doable solo?  I've been seeing waaay too many posts that don't 
quote enough of the previous post lately.  I might even know the answer, 
but the post you're following up to has expired off my server...

Yes, there are things that you can do solo as a 29 erudite wizzy.  Whether 
any of these things were listed in the previous post, only you can tell 
me.
