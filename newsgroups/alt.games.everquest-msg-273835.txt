	I beg to differ.  Allow me to restore the context which you
so amateurishly deleted and I will explain both your current and original
mistakes in terms even your mind is likely capable of grasping, at least
to some extent.

>>Why Would a Good High elf cleric heal or buff an Evil Necro?
>Why, because we're GOOD little clerics... :-)

	A Good cleric would heal an Evil cleric *precisely* because he is 
a Good cleric.  Altruism is a characteristic trait of Good characters,
as is charity towards the enemy.  A classic illustration is Frodo's 
behavior towrads Gollum.  (You *do* understand *that* reference I hope?)

>>In short we choose to be lazy.
>"What you mean 'we', white man?"

	"What you mean 'we', white man?" is of course the punchline
to an ancient joke.  The point is, of course, that there is no "we".  
There is only *you* and the rest of the world. In your approximation of a 
worldview my poor cleric must not only refrain from buffing the wrong 
players, but also speak in thee's and thou's as well as endure lengthy 
simulated boat rides while properly despising those parts of his virtual 
world that don't meet "our" standards.   If not, he is "lazy".

	I'll respond in a way I'm sure even you can understand:

	Bullshit.

							K, thx, bye.
