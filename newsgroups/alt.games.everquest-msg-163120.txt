I know the feeling, I got my WG bracer in april, my tunic, sleeves and
boots on one single night in July, and my leggings last week (just as
well in a way, as last spring I didn't want to wear lederhosen ever
again but by autumn I'd decided I wanted to match).
Anyway, I wore gladiator chain leggins with them for a long while,
which didn't look too good. ES legs would look better (slightly
different shade of green). Black chitin leggings don't look too bad
(wore them till I got the gladiator legs after /dopropertinting nerfed
my gnome skin) but have rather blah stats. Crystal chitin leggings
might also look funky.


Ok, who didn't see a post coming from me on this one?
