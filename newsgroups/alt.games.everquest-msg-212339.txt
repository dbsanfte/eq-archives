as a ranger (again) i'm curious about finding summoned mobs in the 35-50
range

and someone in this thread mentioned hornets in BW, i believe.....that's
incorrect, they're just regular bugs


anyway, lavastorm doesn't have summoned mobs of appropriate level for
long...the shadowed men start cyan'ing

isn't there a higher lvl spot? maybe in LoY ?
