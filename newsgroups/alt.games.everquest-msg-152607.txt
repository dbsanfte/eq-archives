HAHAHAH FOOL!! SWG and EQ2 are not anything like old beat up EQ
Tremble at the onslaught in March when SWG is released, the numbers
for reserved copies are already half of EQ "current" population.

HAHAHA Fool, half of you only went out and bought RAM and a New video
card. I read the posting of you. Most of you still have to stare at
the ground in the bazzar just to walk around. HAHAHA.



>Poor effort, using arguements for Games not yet released, Troll rating, 2.2

Yes, A troll. Anyone who condems your EQ is a troll. Someone can post
here for a while then once something negative is said, you flame them
and brand them Troll. LOLOLOL

You, Sir are a troll in life. I on the other hand am a troll in your
life. I give you a way of venting your frustration in real life here.
You live for trolls.

Thats why you reply. You love the flaming. What would this group be
without it.  Boring. 













Just like your life.
