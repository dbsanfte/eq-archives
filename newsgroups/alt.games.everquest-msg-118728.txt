That's fine...that's all I intended :-).

Again, most of it's lost in the higher-end game, anyways.
My guildees know that I'm not picking pockets, because
we'd just end up splitting the loot anyways.  I "pick-up"
group so rarely, that even if there was a question of
picking pockets, it'd be kind of silly to worry about an
extra plat from every single mob when everybody
is taking home lots of cash anyways.  The one thing I
CAN see somebody getting upset with is that the rogue
you don't know may be picking blue diamonds or
black sapphires or something, but then again, you'd
never know unless he told you in the first place.

I agree, although the days when you could disarm a Yak
off of the Froggie king and pick it up off the floor before
anybody noticed SHOULD be gone.  I can't imagine the
kind of crap a GM had to put up with then...

Of course, back then, nobody grouped with rogues
anyways.  Who wanted a gimp that died the first time
he whiffed a backstab and didn't have an Evade skill
to fall back on?
