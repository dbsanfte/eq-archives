There is a part of the Soulfire quest (Soulfire is a required lead-in to 
the Paladin epic) that can _only_ be completed by multi-questing as it 
requires the turn in of 4 instances of a LORE item.  Although it is 
possible for the same character to turn in all four, it can only be done 
in multi-quest fashion (i.e. separate turn-ins).  And this is only one 
case, no doubt there are others.
Given this I doubt that multi-questing will be taken out.  Instead, as 
another poster noted, Verant has created a number of quests that cannot 
be multi-quested.  Note also that these non-MQ quests include both old 
(Treant Fist quest for Monks dates back to release or shortly 
thereafter) and new (Ghoulbane), which suggests that MQ is in fact part 
of TheVision.
