Hold on a second...you think that Atkins is a "near zero carb" diet?  
That might explain why you claimed I was on a no carb diet.  Is that
because 40-50g of carbs a day constitute "near zero" to you, or is it
because you are misinformed of how the Atkins diet works?

If you are on something that does more than the 40-50g (depending on your
body's metabolism) of carbs a day that Atkins works with, then I guess you
are indeed doing something different than I did.  In which case I
apologize for snapping at you.
