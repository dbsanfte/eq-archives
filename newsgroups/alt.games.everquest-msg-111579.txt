If I recall, Biz solo's and isn't guilded. The high end items are not
obtainable solo, in my experience.
To be able to get decent equipment from looting you need to put in the raid
times and I don't have the time, or really the inclination to do this (can't
speak for Bizbee or anyone else that buys their equipment) if you look at my
druids equipment

Compared to a Druid of similar level but played "properly" ie Ben's

There is some difference there, I buy most of my equipment, am currently
trying (unsuccessfuly) to complete the Earth Blessed Tunic quest. What can
be bought is always going to be inferior to what can be looted. No, buying
is never as fun as looting or questing, the feeling of achievement of
actually get something from your own time and effort is far greater than
just making the plat to buy it (although if it's something you have always
been after it does still give a buzz) but this is what casual and solo (or
in my case, lazy) players have to do the majority of the time.

On that note I'd be interested in seeing a what a equipment the average
(active) low 50's warrior has compared to mine.
