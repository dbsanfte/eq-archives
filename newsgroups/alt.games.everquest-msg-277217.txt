Health of Target's Target window GoD Leadership Ability is foolproof.

It shows you a target bar containing the target of the person or mob you
have targeted.  So if you have a Gnoll targeted and it has Bob targeted
(i.e. Bob has aggro) then it shows Bob's health.

The best thing in the world since sliced bread for tanks, healers, and dps
people.
