I think eb has them in stock today.  I ordered mine from ebgames.com and
it shipped Monday, and came today.  I havent had a chance to check it
out, but I asked my wife a couple of questions about it.  She said it
had PoP maps and lots of text with background info, info on NPCs, etc.
She also said that the maps didnt have X,Y loc coordinates on them,
which a little bit of a bummer but what I expected.
