The answer to all your wants is in wineq, but only the paid version.  The
"fake" full screen mode is exactly what you're looking for, disabled in the
free version.  Has some other neat modes, but I much prefer the full screen
alt-tabbing myself too.  It has another benefit for 2-boxing in the way it
can turn off the background window's rendering.  Makes a huge difference if
you want to keep your resolution high.

I'd pay for it if it were a one-time purchase, but it's a subscription, and
far too large of a percentage of what I'm paying for EQ for my cheap ass to
pay.

/nod , correct. Paid version is what you want.
Go to the lavishsoft forum and ask for a day or two's free trial.  They gave 
me one and I was hooked.  Subscribed immediately after trying it.
