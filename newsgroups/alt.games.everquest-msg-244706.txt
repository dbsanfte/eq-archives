I'm going to agree with James and Graeme here.  Guild I am in "raids"
1 day a week (sunday) with about 40-50 folks that show up.  Not all
are in the guild we really only have maybe 12 or so players but we do
raid with 2 other guilds of about the same size or smaller and a couple
long time friends from other guilds.  We are 1 kill from getting Elemental
access -fire (RZTW) and some assorted backflagging for some folks.  Not
bad at all for folks who only "raid" 1 day a week.  We've also killed 
or attempted various other targets that are fun, RoV, Maestro, Nadox Inny,
as well as some targets that I get continually abused about in /age
*cough* 7th Hammer *cough* :) and the Hate's Fury triggered event.  We
are contemplating going after Khati Sha too, just for grins.  

So it is entireley possibly to be in and keep the Family guild feel and
get access to wherever (TRC might be the end of the line in PoP for our
style tho) without hopping into the UberHamsterTrailHabitat lifestyle.
