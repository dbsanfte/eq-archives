I've been eyeing the shaman Twilight Seas quest BP.  It would be a nice
upgrade to the Bloodstained one I currently wear.  Problem is finding real
info on where the rare mobs that drop the items are.  I did manage to pick
up one of the drops in the bazaar, and have had the jewel for a long time.
I did the vambraces quest for a friend, by buying all 4 items in the bazaar
for 200pp or so.
