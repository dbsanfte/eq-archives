Theres an obvious difference of opinion to what *good* exp is here. When I
was 55 before PoP getting a blue or two a day was good. When I was 55 after
PoP came out all of a sudden I was getting a yellow or more a day it was
freaking unbelievable. Now its too slow apparently but to me its always
going to be good exp.

In any case theres no reason at 56 you cant be doing higher level PoP stuff.
People kill tier one stuff at least 5 levels sooner now than they did when
it was first released. I duo PoI mobs at level 52 with monk/shaman now at
level 55-56 when PoP just came out we had difficulty doing it with a group
of 50-55's. Im sure a group of 56's could handle a higher level camp you
just have to kick thier asses into it.
