1) The example was *partial*; there are many other things that would
also have to be set up.  Yes, the example *as given* doesn't take
class into account; that's why I said it was *partial*.

2) So?  That's why *testing* is supposed to be done.

3) Nope.  For any set of 2 people, it need merely store who attacked
first, and the *effective* level of the designated attacker and
defender.  Further, it only needs to store said information for the
duration of the combat; it gets wiped once the combat's complete and
the faction's been determined.  If 2 complete groups of 6 were to
engage in combat, you'd only have 36 data sets *at most*.


Your basic argument seems to be the one that always gets raised "it's
never been done, therefore it never can be done".  It's an obviously
invalid argument.

To reiterate, I'd like to see an attempt made at PvP where Faction is
*thoroughly* integrated.
