Not to be -too- much of a smartass here, but you have these remarkably 
clever things attached to your legs called 'feet', and being a beastlord, 
I believe you can cast this spell called 'SoW'.  I'm not a SoW class, 
although I do have run3, but the run from Gunthak to the Paineel book 
never takes me much over 5 minutes, and the highest level mob you'll pass 
is about what, 25?  It's definitely quicker than annoying a druid.  Don't 
forget to donate to yourself for the SoW! :)

As to the 'what Item' question:  There's some sort of Spire Shard thingy 
that drops in Grieg's End that has Combine Gate.  Might be int caster only 
though, not sure.  I have some vague memory of a really rare drop off a 
named in rathe mountains that did Gfay or something too.  Or there's the 
good ol' thurg gate potion... See any good writeup of the 4th shawl quest.
