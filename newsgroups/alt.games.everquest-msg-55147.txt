}Oh? How so? The anti-inspection fanatics are quite the minority...

I have yet to see anyone cite any hard facts as to numbers of people 
holding various views on this issue.  How are you so certain you're in the 
majority?

I think a poll would probably break down like this:

I inspect.  I never ask.  Why should I? 5%
--
I like being able to inspect people, but usually ask first and
I don't mind people inpecting me, but prefer being asked first 50% 
--
Keep your inspect off my body! 5%
--
What's 'inspection'? 40%

But I don't have a poll to refer to either.  Believe what you will.
