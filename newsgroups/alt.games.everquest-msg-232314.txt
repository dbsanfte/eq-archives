58 was bad, but 59 is worse, particularly with the dropoff in Nightmare's
XP (if you were doing the Stalkers).

I know you're excluding tier II but rotting forest frogs in PoStorms is
about
as good solo XP as you are going to get at that level, and access is easily
sorted for someone your level. Failing that, the Slarghilug camp in PoN
can be done with care: from entrance move through Treant Alley to charm
a static raven, and drop down onto the big rock (as far north as you can go
without aggroing gobbies). There's a good guide somewhere.

Or, accept that soloing as a druid at 59 sucks and group with someone :)
LDoN, for example, is always good particularly as you should have a decent
heal right now.
