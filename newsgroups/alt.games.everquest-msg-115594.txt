The thread details how a group of mages from meny different guild on one
server organised a raid to Air to get Crowns for their epic.
The raid has so far lasted 4 (?) days and they have 10 crowns farmed.

The raid consists on average of 25 mages + 6 cleric + 1 monk (Some times
there are a few others there too)
They just /pet attack and kill mobs in under 30 seconds.

Quite ammusing.
They aim to stay up there untill all 30 odd mages have a crown.
