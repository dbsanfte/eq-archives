So my 38 mage was happily nuking stuff to death with a ranger MT
today, and I decided I wanted a cheaper nuke in addition to
Blaze, which is a 34 evocation spell I'd been mostly using.  I
memmed Shock of Spikes, a 24 conjuration based nuke, and since it
-was- just level 24, I also summoned myself my old Jade Bracelet,
which says it boosts damage from nukes level 24 and under.

Imagine my surprise, then, to see it working like a charm on my
Blaze spell as well.  I think my highest Blaze without it was 256
or so, although I wasn't really paying attention.  With it, I did
309, I'm certain I never did more than 299.  Kept on using it,
was definately getting the message saying that it was working,
and my highest damage with it was 344.

I don't have an ID item, certainly not an ID II+ item, which
would be needed for a level 34 spell.

Not that I'm complaining, mind you.

Splendid One, 38 gnomage, Firiona Vie
