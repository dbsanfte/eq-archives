I read somewhere that someone has done an experiment. For every guard you
kill, you need to kill 2 kobolds to get the heretic faction back.

Would not be much of a trick to stay amiable with them if that's the case.
I can kill more kobolds in 10 min than guards  spawn in an hour.

Would do wonders for your Deepwater and caster factions in erudin too.
