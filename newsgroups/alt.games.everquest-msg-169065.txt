Two questions:
1) Did you read the OP?
2) Didn't your mother teach you that it's rude to top-post in a.g.e.?

Question 1-Yes and somewhere along the thread someone asked where the book
was as they couldn't find it.
Question 2-No she didn't, she did however mention that unpleasantness toward
people trying to help is an undesirable quality.

I really don't think I can be bothered with this NG anymore- I'm not expert
enough with Usenet to avoid sending people like you into paroxysms of
indignition and rudeness every time I make a mistake. I'm obviously a n00b
and if to become one of the L337s I have to thow a fit everytime somebody
else forgets to dot an i, I think I'd rather stay a n00b. I have no clue
what has upset you and don't know what a.g.e is but fuck it, I'm done
anyway.
