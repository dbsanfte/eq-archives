Um, yeah.

When did you start playing a warrior?

At least on a dwarf, there are only about one or two very small parts of the
throne where you could wedge yourself in to not get thrown over the damn
thing.  And if you get knocked a little out of it, good luck trying to wedge
yourself back in blind.   Second, maybe times have changed, but at least
back when I was doing him, a slow  hard hitting weapon would be a good way
to have major aggro problems, unless you're talking a Blade of War or some
such thing.   And lastly, IV doesn't really enrage.  He gives off the
message, but he doesn't actually do it.  You can keep attacking with no
problems.
