I think rogues are on a better table, but I could be wrong.


Even if Rogues are on the same table though, they'll still have a slight
advantage damagewise.  Using backstab while a mob is facing you gives an
extra primary hand attack, which will do more damage then bash / kick.

And in a discussion of generic rogues, Twinkbringer also deserves special
mention, as it's a relatively easy to obtain weapon with a good ratio, built
in 40% haste and a hefty +atk bonus.  It too will be replaced in the
endgame, but it takes longer due to the usefulness of it.
