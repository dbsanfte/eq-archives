I ran into the same thing when leveling my enchanter when I was in the
same zone for a long time. People expected me to clarity them every 25
minutes regardless of my mana supply or what kind of pull my group
had. Finally I just told people, "sorry, I have too many people
begging me for clarity. I'll only cast it on you once a day" That
helped a lot.

That's easy. <g> Tell them you'll get to it when you are FM. Then make
sure you don't get to FM. Dot the mobs, heal and buff the party. When
they ask again, remind them of what you said, and explain that you're
not fm yet. If they bitch about the delay, tell em you're not going to
cast it since they bitched.

"I don't have it memmed right now" also works well.

Make them amuse you. They expect something for nothing, get something
back anyway. Have em dance or sing or tell a joke for the casting.
Some people get mad when you ask them to; that's great because you've
found someone who doesn't deserve the spell, so don't cast it. If they
do it, the entertainment goes a long way towards reducing the
frustration of dealing with buff beggars, at least for me. YMMV

Best of all, say no. I used to get a laugh out of people who seemed so
shocked when my answer was "no". 

Remember, you aren't playing the game to be a buff bitch. The buff
beggars are playing the game to be entertainment for you. Take
advantage of it. :)
