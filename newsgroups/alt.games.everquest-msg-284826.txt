Hehe. Anyway, can anyone explain to me how it is that I ran the patcher a 
few hours ago, and it took some hour and a half, yet now, upon connecting 
to the patcher again, I'm looking at another 40 minutes of downloads?

Patience just doesn't pay. I'm gonna have to set the patcher up to fire off 
every hour on the hour next patch day. Maybe then it will be done when I 
get home from work.
