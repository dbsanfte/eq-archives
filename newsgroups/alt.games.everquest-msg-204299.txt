Nope, I'm a brand new EQ user and my only character is an 18 lvl Shaman.  Been 
playing only a month.  Never had KEI before.  All I knew is that Breeze and 
Clarity were supposed to speed up mana regen and so far I haven't noticed them 
to speed it up at all.  I'm sure it's working it's just not very noticeable.
