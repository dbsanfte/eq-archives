Ever since the LDoN patch I've been going LD about half the time
when I zone.  This isn't even the first post I've made about it
here... But I feel like griping some more.

I've done two LDoN dungeons thus far.  I've been invited to three
others and in each case, have run across several zones, sometimes
with short LDs, only to LD so long zoning into the Wayfarer camp
zone that I finally give up.

I really can't keep going LFG for LDoN like this, its one thing
to LD and log right back in, but when I get 1018 error (you
already have an active character) for fifteen minutes straight...
well I can't do that to a group, what if I go LD zoning into the
actual dungeon itself and get stuck like that?  Its one thing
(not a good thing) to keep people waiting 15 minutes for the
stupid server to figure out I'm not active, its another thing (a
much worse thing) to keep them waiting that long when they are on
a one hour time limit mission.

I can still group and play normally, which means joining a group
in a zone I'm already in, or perhaps crossing one or two zones to
get to the hunting spot.  But LDoN, which means zone to POK, zone
to old world, zone to wayfarer zone, then with mission in hand
zone again once or twice before finally zoning in to the mission
area... 

Is there a patch for this on the horizon?  I've talked to other
people (some on this newsgroup) who have the same problem, so its
not just me, but others don't have it, so it isn't something that
is strictly an SOE problem...
