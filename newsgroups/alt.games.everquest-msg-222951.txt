I guess the big question is were the boss mobs tuned for this or not. I
know in our guild and most high end guilds on our server we don't have
enough bards to stack them up like that anyway, so the only way we could
have used it would be to have one bard click stopping and starting the
song to pump out more mana. I don't recall us doing that even for
Xegony, which is the only mob I can think of offhand where mana is a
huge issue.
