Have to hunt them for new quest armor, but they are ridiculously rare.
Anyone have any advice in terms of where/when they might spawn? I think one
spot is on the hill near the druid ring in Misty Thicket.

Also, can I start a new ranger, track them, then jump off/on with my paladin
to kill it? Is that allowed?
