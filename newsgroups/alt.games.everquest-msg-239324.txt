Well, it would be 3 a.m. for the people working for SOE in San Diego
who are doing the patches.  I'm sure some of them might prefer to do
the patches at some reasonable time in the day or early evening
instead of in the middle of the night, but instead they do it at a
time when presumably the smallest number of people would be playing so
as not to be too disruptive.
