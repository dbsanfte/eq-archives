South Qeynos, near the ponds down a line away from the wharf. Go to
http://www.eqatlas.com and The Atlas and look for Qeynos and print of
the maps. Very helpful stuff.

Also look up http://www.eqtraders.com as another very helpful site.

I find alakazam (sp?) to be rather torutous and use google to find where
the information is on it.

Some people close off certain comms channels to become more immersed in
the game. It gcan get rather annoying when people conduct conversations
through /ooc or /shout. It is far easier to send a tell to each other
then /r (but don't do this with multiple people at one unless you all
group and use the group channel instead ).
