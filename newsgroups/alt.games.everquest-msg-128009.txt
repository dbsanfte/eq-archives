Not necessarily...

My brother has a 42 cleric on his account.  Sometimes I'll dual-box
my alt rogue to kill tougher opponents than she can solo if I want
to gain exp quick (like getting Run 3 while only 1 yellow into 51).

At 53 1/2, she can effectively solo level 38-39 mobs for decent blue
(not light blue) exp.  She then heals to full with her Mrylo BP.
Dual-boxing
my brother's LOWER level cleric (but WITH complete heal), she can
move away from soloing singles in the Dreadlands (level 38-39ish
mobs, with several lower level light blues) to soloing singles in
Burning Woods that are level 43-45 (although even 45's tend to
drain mana if the cleric strictly heals).  Exp flies by then.

PL'ing to me is simply one or more CHARACTERS (not individual
people) cooperating to give a huge exp boost to a single character.
