My current main is a female high elf wizzie, and I kind-of-do the
wilting-flower bit (OH NO! I've been attacked for damage! Run around in
circles!). I take damage every once in a while, and whine about it. It is a
laugh to play this way. As a wizzie, it is also smart.

Of course, my wizzie does *tons* of DPS to most of the mobs, and the melee
toons really appricate this.  ;)

My other main is a male Orge SK - He *loves* taking damage, and beating
things to death (It's only a scratch! My lifebar is at 20%!)
