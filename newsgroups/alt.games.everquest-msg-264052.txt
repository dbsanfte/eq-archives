None of those websites are official SoE websites, they merely collect 
information submitted by players and/or the owners of the sites.  The 
fact that noone has figured out how to create Aerated mineral water does 
not mean there is no recipe that will work for it, it just means that if 
it is not broken, noone has discovered the recipe.  Certainly it is also 
possible that it is a broken recipe, I am sure there are plenty of them 
in game.

The new tradeskill UI will not show recipes for all items, many you have 
to first create successfully once to add the recipe to your list, some 
will never be added to your list (mostly quest related recipes), and many 
of the simple ones are automatically in your recipe list to begin with.

All I am saying is that the fact that noone has discovered it, does not, 
in and as of itself, mean that the recipe is broken.
