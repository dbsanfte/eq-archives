I too use the site quite often.

I'm reminded of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy:

"... it has long supplanted the great Encylopedia Galactica as the 
standard repository of all knowledge and wisdom, for though it has many 
omissions and contains much that is apocryphal, or at least wildly 
inaccurate, it scores over the older more pedestrian work in two 
important respects.  First, it is slightly cheaper, and secondly, it has 
the words DON'T PANIC printed in large friendly letters on its cover."

Well, Lucy and Castersrealm are both free, so there's no cheaper about 
it... but Castersrealm is much better arranged and friendlier to read, 
has lots of chatty discussion about the individual spells, and just 
plain isn't so intimidating.

Wrong?  Yes, sometimes.  But heck, its a good starting place, and then 
the more experienced user can dash over to Lucy for a good look at the 
reality of the situation.

Still mourning Douglas Adams, not only a great humorist but one of the 
most original and inventive science fiction authors who ever lived, 
throwing away more high concept ideas in a chapter than the average 
author does in ten books.
