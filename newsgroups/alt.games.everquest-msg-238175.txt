Not incompatible.  Not too many mobs on OT on the Chardok fation:

Mostly, kill the Gobboes in the Mines and Temple.  I guess some of the
wanderers in Frontier will give you faction too.

Your best strategy? Get to 35 or so and then start hunting in Frontier
and the entrance to Nurga. Try and avoid killing random Sarnaks in the
meantime.
