In case you looted one of these and are hanging on to it, this just in
from Absor:

ETCHED PERIDOT OF NATURE

Some of you may have discovered this item recently. It's been found on
dead Shadow Men since the last patch. Most likely you are wondering what
it isï¿½

It's a mistake. 

It's a quest item for Shadows of Luclin that accidentally started
showing up on Shadowed Men. It can't be equipped, has no magical bonuses
of any sort and is worth only a few gold pieces to merchants.

So with the next patch we are going to delete them completely from the
current world. So I suppose it would be a good idea to sell off any that
you have before the next patch. Let the merchants take the loss.
