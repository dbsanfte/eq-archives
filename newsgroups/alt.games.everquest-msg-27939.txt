Hehe

I was in OS a few nights ago on a CR.

Someone shouted some profanity across the zone (yet another 'who trained
us?' rant). There happened to be a GM and 2 guides in the zone. He promptly
/ooc'ed that anyone using profanity in the public channels would get a
warning.

Then he summoned my corpse to the zone entrance : )

Gotta love those GMs!

(and no, I don't think it is acceptable to use hard-core profanity in
public, filter or no filter)
