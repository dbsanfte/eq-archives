I liked the concept of the original (I love zoos) and bought the
bundle pack with the dinos and the Sea World stuff. But I just
couldn't stand to play it and soon put it away. The amount of
twiddling to get the damn dirt and plants and rocks and fences to the
animals' liking was stupefying. I want to MANAGE and DESIGN a big zoo,
not worry if my gazelles don't like pine straw. The game was a great
execution of a bad feature set.

At least let me lay down an optimal pen for the animal with a couple
of clicks rather than color it in piece by tiny piece.
