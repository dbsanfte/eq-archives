The nutshell version is the x86 family is backwards compatible; i.e.,
the latest and greatest Pentium 4 processors are backwards compatible
with the ancient 8086/8088 processors from the late 70s.  The same
kind of thing applies to a large degree to the PC architecture itself.

This made it relatively easy and straightforward to keep DOS and Windows
backwards compatible.

When Apple moved from the Apple II to the Mac line, and Commodore moved
from the Commodore 64 to the Amiga line, and Atari moved from the Atari
400/800 to the Atari ST line (the list goes on), they radically changed
things because they switched from 6502-based CPUs to 68000-based CPUs.

To achieve backwards compatibility, they would have either had to build
two computers in one (really expensive) or write emulators that emulated
their older model lines (expensive).  DOS and Windows just kept getting
backwards compatibility almost for free.

I fully support your attitude.  An end user shouldn't *have* to care.
Things should just work.  In hindsight, perhaps Apple, Commodore, Atari
and other companies should have offered emulators to make the upgrade
path easier on their users.

In the old days, you programmed pretty close to the metal.  I'm not sure
it would have been economically feasible for the C128 to be backwards
compatible with the C64 except in the way they did it.  That's no excuse
for the C128 being a flop, though; they should have just discontinued the
C64 line and did the C64 emulator thing on the Amiga.

Yes, you have lots of software to choose from when you're running Windows.
I'm just pointing out that there are often more important factors to
consider when choosing your OS.
