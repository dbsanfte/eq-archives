The argument was that people had worked out an exploit to equip characters
in such a way they were not supposed to. I am not sure whether an equivalent
will be found but if it is (and a lot of money would ride on it if the $200
000 000 figure quoted was correct) then the consequences would be that all
servers would be de-facto exchange servers, albeit not to the same degree.

It seems another major problem is that MMOGs can be played by bots with a
very limited AI. Crafting, for example, is largely something i imagine a
programmer could solve in an afternoon... if event (symbol(x)), match symbol
x with ascii character ("3", else return "1", "2") or something similar.

I think a good game is one that would not be easily scriptable, but i don't
think anyone has a crafting system like that ... but if they did i'd love it
if SOE adopted it. I liked crafting initially but it's so cumbersome, clunky
and repetitious, and i don't clearly see how to fix it, so I've stopped
doing it despite diverse characters covering many of the tradeskill areas. I
think the provisioner is the best because theres less interdependence, but
even then the inventory space has to be huge, which mean lots of bags with
lots of slots, and i find that distances me from feeling i'm cooking
things... chefs don't stick the food in their pockets, if it's in the
kitchen they can use it ;-)

I hope this whole exchange server fizzles out, or that i don't get blocked
from content by bots and twinks. I don't really want to go back to CRPG's,
the ones that grabbed me are long gone, like baldur's gate 2 (I wanted to be
the god but have the dark elf chick as my partner) and Planescape (I wanted
the succubus to fight her way in to hell and rescue him as the sequel!).

Ah well, I guess I can find something else for thrills, like smuggling
marijuana into Bali.
