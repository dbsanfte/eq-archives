    That's all fine and good when all that anyone gets is experience. As
soon as that 45 K item drops, things change. Fast.

    The camp you're in is very important. If a shaman knew that NBG was the
norm, they'd head to camps where, surprise surprise, SHM stuff dropped. They
wouldn't group with you in your camp because they can't get anything more
than XP there, and there's tons of places to get XP where they can get loot,
too.

    Saying "he can't use" on a droppable item is silly, especially with The
Bazaar. That Tranquil Staff that you would like will, within a day or so,
become a Jaundiced Bone Breastplate that the SHM would like. Or whatever the
SHM can buy with the TStaff money. So yes, he can use it to gear himself up,
just like you can. So why should you be preferred over him?

    And that generous offer hoses over the INT casters in the camp, who get
nothing but a chance at a POS ring that nobody wants in the first place. Why
should they be third class compared to the melees (SCW, SCHW, CF, VAotVB)
and WIS casters (CCS)?
