FWIW, I have the same problem on my new machine with Star Wars: Galaxies. I
haven't found a fix, yet, but I did find a work-around. If I get that error
when I try and go into the game, since I don't always encounter it, I
restart SWG but run a thorough file check (or whatever they call their
equivalent) when I get that option. Haven't yet had a problem getting in
after I do that. That may help with EQ, but I admit I haven't been playing
it enough lately to know for sure.
