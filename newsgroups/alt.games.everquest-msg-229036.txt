I'm bringing up another twink in my spare time, (a cleric of all things) 
and have fairly quickly made it into the low twenties in PC. (Blah, 
yeah, I know.) Looks like that is only good to around 25 or so, though. 
It's been a long time since I had to do any grouping in the lowbie 
levels and I'm wondering where people are finding good xp groups for the 
25 to 35 range?

Back in the day, High Hold Keep was good, but that's a bit of a run and 
I've heard tell that it's a ghost town these days. I don't have LDoN 
yet, so I'd need zones from before that.

Any suggestions?
