Avoid oasis like the sewer-rat infested plague that it is.

Gnoll reavers (and undead reavers) in east karana are great. Lake of ill
omen is not bad either...but usually pretty heavily populated.

Runneye would be ok if you can get a group....but even then, that zone
sucks rocks. Trains are bad, and high 20s caster mobs randomly wander up
from the bottom to the higher areas to wipe out anyone who is actually
hunting there.
