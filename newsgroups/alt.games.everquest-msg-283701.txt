Ditto.  My monk's FD was consistently failing until I learned
I needed to turn off attack first.  Of course, that may have
changed since I learned it. :-)  At this point, it's all bundled
up into a hotkey: /attack off, /doability N, /loc.  The /loc is
there because anytime I FD there's presumably some chance I'm
going to die.

On my SK, the spell doesn't seem to require that I turn off
attack, which is good.

Regarding audio triggers, yes, it's good to have one for "<yourname>
has fallen to the ground".  I can't think of a trigger that'll catch
only spells being cast at you, so no way to hear it in advance and
abort the feign to preserve the timer.  But I do have a trigger for
"You are no longer feigning death" (because a spell hit you) so I'll
know immediately if my cover's been blown.

Actually, I think audio triggers are a fine topic for a separate
thread, which I'll start up presently.

As for the mobs' tendency to hang around a while after you feign,
that's not a bug, that's a feature!  The mobs seem to wait a random
length of time, which means usually they will wander off one at a
time.  That makes it possible to stand up and tag the last one to
complete the split.  However, as others have mentioned, the other
mobs that left earlier may or may not have forgotten you.
