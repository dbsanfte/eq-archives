I have the sneaking suspicion that this will cure an LD problem I've been
having recently... getting 95% packet loss which goes away when I do a
/who all friends (or sometimes a /tell x x). It would frequently start
happening when I started moving.

(NOT an ISP problem - I was running a tcpdump in parallel as well as pinging
the server, both with no appreciable loss.)
