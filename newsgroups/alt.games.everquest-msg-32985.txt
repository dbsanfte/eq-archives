Never made it to him.

We also tried Rivervale.  It's really inconvenient to have the Cleric guild
right by the zone.  Freeport went rather well until we accidentally pulled
the entire bard guild.  The problem with the raids are always that we can't
do anything against the adds when they are guild trainers.  1 or 2 guild
trainers isn't an issue, 4 or 5 is.  One thing I was toying with, was doing
the Phin/PoD trick in Qeynos, and picking off Phin after the PoD has knocked
his HP down to 70%.
