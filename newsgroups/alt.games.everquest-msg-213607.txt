   I dunno what it is, but it seems that in last couple of weeks there's
been a large influx of people from AGE start Firiona Vie alts, several
in the last couple of days.  Seems every time I am looking at the
/serverwide.age:age channel I see a new name pop up with no server name
in front of it.  This presents to me an obvious question.

    What do you people want from me????  I spent all my money on a
dromar!  I don't have enough dots to temp you all!  And I'm scared to
anyways because someone on the channel says he'll rip my face off if I
temp him and one of you might be him!

   Worse, one insane part of my mind wonders if there are eight of youse
that can be gathered at the same place and time as Lenny and I...
