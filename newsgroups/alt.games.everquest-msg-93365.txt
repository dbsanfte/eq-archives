It's very obvious you've never played a cleric or druid or wizzie in higher
levels.

My cleric ran around anon and usually had /afk up to avoid the spam I got
for rezzes. Yes I could say no to them but you wouldn't believe how many
people think the game revolves around them, I am here to play for my
pleasure not cater to every person who "desperatly needs a rez".

Alot of people have had the gall to tell me off when I say I'm busy,
claiming it was selfish of me to not drop everything I was doing and run
over to rez them. The only people I was willing to drop what I was doing and
go rez was my guildmates and closest friends and even then some tended to
abuse that.

To sum this up before I write a novel, having someone ask for help every now
and then is fine but when you get endless tells it gets very very tiresome
which is why you will likely find if you send a direct tell to a druid,
wizzie, or cleric you'll probably not get an answer unless they are just
sitting around doing squat.
Personally I just don't answer the tells if i'm busy, only because i hate
listening to people whine, complain, act generally rude towards me when I
say no.
