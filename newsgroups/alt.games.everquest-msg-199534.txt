Ah yes, I found something by that Skrax faction guy to the same
effect.

So the banker is on kaladim merchants, but I'm so far in the hole
with them that I am still scowl as a dark elf to him. While in
halfling or dwarf form I'm dubious to him.

So I'll have to do lot more cb belts I guess, as well
as other warrior guild quests that raise merchants.
I guess that when I see a dwarf merchant con apprehensive, I'll know
that I'm not kos to the banker for sure?
