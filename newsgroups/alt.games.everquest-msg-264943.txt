One of my other favorites was Harn, not for the ruleset, hated that, but 
for the pure imensity of the world and the details provided.  I own a 
near complete set of all the Harn books.

GURPS was ok, but was a bit too simplified for my tastes.  It was a 
similar concept to hero systems, but even more simplified.  I loved the 
versatility of the hero systems, (Champions, Fantasy Hero, a couple 
others).  I did use a lot of the GURPS supplements but played with the 
Hero system.

I have tried so many different systems, I doubt I could name them all, 
but what the heck :p

D&D, AD&D (through rev 3), Bushido (Revs 1 and 2), Amber, Traveller, 
Space Opera, Twilight 2000, Runequest, Harn, GURPS, Hero systems, C&S, 
Aftermath, Paranoia, Boot Hill, Vampire, and at least one other fantasy 
one whose name escapes me.

Of them all, I like Hero Systems best for the versatility of the 
character design system, GURPS was great for world adaptations, Harn was 
awesome for a very well fleshed out fantasy world.

It's been about 10 years since I've played any of them, so I am totally 
out of date as to what is out there now, and what is still widely played.
