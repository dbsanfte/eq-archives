Yeah, well, that's one opinion.

But for example I started playing 4 months ago, have 3 chars. Then my wife
also wanted to "check the game out" and, no wonder, she's kinda addicted too
now :) It would be nice to play together but her character is on my account.
So I needed to move her character to her account so she can play from the
second PC. $50 is much ? Hmm .. maybe, maybe not. But it's a one time fee
and I don't think I will go bankrupt or something.

Anyway, I think it's good we have a choice now. Nobody is making you move
your char ... If you want to move, you pay. If not, don't .It is that
simple.

Regards,
