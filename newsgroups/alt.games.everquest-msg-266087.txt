For crying out loud, you're not a grand judge or anything - enough with the 
childish "end of story 'cuz I sez so'" drivel. 

Xocyll is precisely and legally right: It's THEIR (Cryptic) GAME. If they 
want to define "kill stealing" as wearing a yellow tu-tu and dancing atop a 
statue in Atlas Park, then that's what "Kill stealing" is AS IT APPLIES TO 
CoH. 

Remember, kiddies, that this is a GAME - It consists of FICTION - fiction 
that is made up by the devs - While you and many of the players may apply 
and abide by conventions drafted from other games, they are by the 
players' agreement only. If the devs tell you something is or is not in 
THEIR game - then, it is or is not - in their game. 

Do you understand this, yet ?

Do I have the right to come to your house and tell you that your dog's name 
is actually Albert, that is' okay to put your feet up on the television and 
to drink beer out of your wedding picture frames ? No ? Why not ? It's a 
convention in OTHER houses, so why can't I dictate this convention in YOUR 
house, hmmm ?
