I'm sure the execs and SOE will say it all UbiSoft's fault. Since
they were responsible for the EU side and did such a bad job SOE
dropped them. I'm not saying I agree with SOE but that's their
view.

Yep, the game failed to connect with customers at launch. Changing all
the things people didn't like isn't going to help it now. Making
EQ2 like every other mmog isn't the way to convince people to get it.
They need something unique (and then hope Blizzard doesn't copy it
and do it better!)
