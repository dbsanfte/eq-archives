I had a blast on my 29 ranger, as MA. The MT and cleric dealt with 
keeping the mobs coming and the heals incoming...I just hit the mob with 
all i had. We got to the room with the rescue victim with about 5 
minutes to spare, lost the cleric and decided to go fer broke and stomp 
the crap out of the 3 mobs in the room and run fer the border...got 2 
adventure points out of it=) I found it relatively easy to get a group 
in east commons first day...everybody brought the ueber mains and the 
lowers were the newer players [i guess] and when I saw there was a good 
looking group of 25-30 looking for a MA, i immediately asked if i could 
bring my ranger. logged my main in long enough once we all got to the 
aone to temperence and resist buff people, and went in without much 
buffing on me other than what our 27 cleric had in her spellbook.

The groups i have one with my main, 54 cleric have all failed...for 
those same reasons, a group using unfamiliar tactics, and not used to 
working together. We almost succeeded all 3 times, but the main problem 
with 1 grouping was no MT, just a pair of rangers [and that one came the 
closest to succeeding, despite losing 1 ranger to RL halfway through the 
adventure] and another grouping was a SK who had a john wayne complex 
and kept running ahead to look things over and couldnt resist opening 
boxes...

All in all, my favrite expansion=) all 4 times i made decent loot though 
losing all the rolls...but i did get given the jascinths as my only 
portion of the loot in one case [i am a GM jeweler an use them to make 
seals...] and i havent decided if i am going to save or spend my 
adventure points=)
