CHA used to be believed to be a useless stat. Several parses of it in the
Concert Hall have found it to have a very, very significant impact on missed
notes - most notabably those with fizzle adjustments on them (mostly
chants). CHA does indeed seem to have an effect in a few other areas (such
as whether you get aggro if a mob resists a lull), but the effect is much,
much smaller.

STA is worth roughly 3HP per point to start with, and goes up from there
depending on level and some AA's. For a bard, HP is perhpas the single most
important stat (so, for example, take something with a +50HP adjustment over
something with +5 STA). Mine stinks mind you, but that's largely because my
bard was the first toon I created (and is still my main today), and I knew
NOTHING when I created him other than what the stupid SOE guide told me.
