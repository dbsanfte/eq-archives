The screenshots are real.  I play EQ with the creator of Fansy on his real
server, Rallos Zek.  In most of the screenshots that he takes, he lags and
wipes out afterwards, but Fansy has always been an EQ entertainer from way
back when.


Some people hail Fansy a hero, and some hail him a psycho.  People have
written songs about him:...

 and there are now Fansy imposters who feel they must carry on his work.

Fansy made his last appearance on Sullon Zek, on Friday evening to kick off
the starting of the good alligned guild, Flowers Of Happiness.  Other works
by Fansy's creator can be seen at www.notacult.com
