And the moment you begin DEMANDING I do something, I'm gone.  (Sorry, 
couldn't resist getting in on this!).

In all reality (hehe), I need a reminder...did the OP mention if he had 
told the GROUP why he wasn't giving a rez, or just a private tell to the 
rogue?  As I don't play a cleric (well, I started one and got him all the 
way to level 2), I don't get into this problem that often.  If *I* screw 
the pooch and die, I take the xp hit.  If cleric-o'-the-day decides to 
offer a rez, I'll take it.  Of course, I'm in the game to have fun, not 
to let myself get pissed off about someone not doing what *I* want 
him/her to do.

At the same time, I've seen the kind of player that the rogue was 
reported to be.  Left the group and didn't look back.  (The guy had been 
warned too many times for me to bother with, so I told the group leader I 
was leaving and why.)  And I try my best to not loot the night away with 
anyone else, unless the group happens to be a few select friends that 
actually feel like it's a competition to see who can loot the corpse(s) 
first!  

That said, I just wanted in on this thread, as it's gone on longer than I 
thought it would.

I'm done.  See ya!
