Well, NPCs don't generally respond with "Fuk u u dumb RPer", for one
thing. For another, roleplaying is not an "effort" that can be "wasted".
One does it if one enjoys it, it's not an obligation. Besides, RPing
with NPCs does not preclude that you do it with your group too, if they
are roleplayers. Then again, I don't really group a whole lot. I love
interacting with people (that's the reason I play EQ and not, say,
Baldur's Gate), but I cannot be arsed to actually group with them.
