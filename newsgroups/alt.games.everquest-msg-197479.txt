I never found much use for the charm animal line of spells, except for
situational uses.

For example, apparently the higher level spell is useful in Kedge Keep. Even
if you don't intend to keep a fish as a pet, it's superb when you have a
place (such as the entrance I belive) where there are two mobs next to each
other. Rather than fighting them both, you charm one, make sure it wins
(just), then turn it into canned tuna!

Apparently rhinos/cats in OT make very good pets as well.
