Chat windows allow a player to use multiple windows for specific chat
tasks.  For example if you are on a guild raid you can have all your
say and guild text in one window and your raid and battle spam in
another.

You can create as many windows as you like but most players opt for two
or three as the screen gets too busy.

To create another chat window right click on your current chat window,
a menu should appear . choose new chat window.

In the new chat window right click and choose filters.  Another menu
opens which allows you to choose which types of messages go into the
new window.

You can continue customising these windows with the filters to split
the different types of chat between the windows.
