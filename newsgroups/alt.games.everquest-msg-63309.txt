I saved a lot of time by finding the latest game I'd bought (Dark Age
of Camelot) and checking the CD, because most games ship with whatever
was the latest DirectX when they were released.  Sure enough, it had
8.0.  I figured installing 8.0 from a CD than updating to 8.1 might be
less downloading than going straight to 8.1.

For going from 8.0 to 8.1, I let Windows Update do it.  That worked
smoothly.
