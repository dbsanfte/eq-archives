I give it six months, a year at the outside.  (And I'll bet it's
implemented across all of EQ2 within half that time.)

I admit to having mixed feelings about this, though mostly I don't
like it.  If all they were doing was providing a secure channel for
transactions that are taking place anyway, then it wouldn't really
have much effect.  But obviously, by providing that channel, they
make it more likely that people will avail themselves of it, both
because it's more secure, and because it's been legitimized.  And
having more plat sellers and Ebayed characters (using the term
generically, since of course Ebay won't be involved) can't be good
for the game.

But my real fear is that SOE *will* succumb to the temptation to
generate content for the purposes of making extra cash off these
sales.  I.e., up the drop rate on items or plat so that there'll
be more cross-player sales that they can take a cut of.  And that's
not even counting the temptation to generate plat and items and
sell them directly to players, so that SOE gets all the money.
It's a slippery slope, and everything I've seen to date suggests
that SOE is happily sledding down it without regard to the cliff
at the bottom.

I did have one thought today, though, that makes me wonder if they
realise all the implications of the Station Exchange.  (Well, let's
be serious.  Obviously they haven't.)  I don't know how much they
plan to charge for "listing" things for sale, but I assume it can't
be too big a cut or people will still try to bypass them.  But they
currently charge $50 for moving a character (well, up to two) from
one account to a different account on the same server.  I don't
know how much revenue they make from such transfers, but they won't
be getting any once Station Exchange comes to EQLive, because it'll
almost certainly be cheaper to sell yourself the character for $0.01.
