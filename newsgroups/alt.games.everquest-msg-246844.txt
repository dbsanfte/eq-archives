You may use sneak & hide to get around behind mobs.

However, I don't know if that will actually let you backstab them, 
before they turn around... I can't say that I've ever tried it 
personally. And in groups... its never come up either.

The backstab ability (and the entire rogue) is primarily intended to be 
used in groups. I suppose it can also be used on low-health runners, but 
at that point the battle is pretty much won anyhow.

Rogues are probably among the absolute worst soloing classes out there. 
  Perhaps *the* worst.
