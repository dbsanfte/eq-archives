EQAtlas indicates that no race/class will be KOS in the
Nexus/Bazaar/Shadowhaven area, as the inhabitants of that area are more
merchant type people who do not like to fight.  And since they are primarily
focused on selling goods they will sell to just about anyone.  An
interesting thing though is that both the Light Combine cit and the dark
combine city both have Paladin trainers.  Unless this info is incorrect and
one is really a SK trainer.  In fact, I can't find any INT class trainers on
Luclin (inc SKs), apart from Bards (to a lesser degree).  Of course these
maps are jsut pre-release ones so I am sure they out there to be found
somewhere.
