Just throwing out a few other things that others havent already
mentioned...

Do you have a beefy enough power supply and cooling for your system?

I had a similar problem on a machine, when I swapped out the video
card with another (same card - same manufacturer) it worked fine - was
a bad video card. Although I was getting strange graphics on the
character select screen (really bizarre clipping problems) that you
didnt mention.

Another problem I had on another system was related to memory timing.
I could actually play for a few minutes then it would either just lock
up or suddenly reboot itself. After playing with the memory timing
settings (on my MB - it wasnt in bios but a jumper on the MB), its
been rock solid ever since (although a little slower).

You might browse the Tech support boards on EQ's main site. There are
a few people there that are very knowlegeable (I think it was Tebos on
that board that alerted me to my memory timing issues).
