I've done pickup groups for 5 years now, more often than "picked 
friends" groups or "guildies only" groups, and only slightly behind Solo 
or "me and a friend" groups.

I have, however, a -lot- of tolerance for general low level ignorance, 
stupidity, foolishness, and even light rudeness.

After all, I home school my kids (anyone who does this has a fool for a 
principle) and run a business with up to 50 employees at some parts of 
the year; if I couldn't suffer fools gladly I'd have run away to a 
desert island long ago... or at least a dessert island, the local 
Coldstone Creamerie is a relief from time to time.
