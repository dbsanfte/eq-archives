Well folks you have given me some good advice and I have created a word doc
from cutting and pasting pages that is probably about 25 pages long so far.
Cardinal I will try and  make a human warrior and then find the newbie zone.
Slapfish nice link to that page got some good info off of it. Jeremiah I
have been to both sites and cut and pasted the info into that word doc.
Georg great faq you sent me to got some good info. I have cut and pasted all
this stuff into a word doc and plan on printing it out and use as reference.
I plan on taking all the movement and other keyboard commands and putting
them in an excel spreadsheet and putting that in the word doc. I will stick
this whole thing in on my laptop and then use it while I am playing the
game. Might even try and port this information to a pocket pc type list so
those that have a pocket pc can use it. I will of course credit everyone
that I got information from.
