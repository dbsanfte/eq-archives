Bards are a swiss army knife class; much of their power is in
their extreme flexibility, but this comes at the cost of total
attention; I've played about half the classes in the game by now,
and I have yet to see one that requires anything resembling the
focus a bard must have to do well.  Three song twists are about
3/5ths the potential power output of a bard, but I doubt you can
get good performance automating anything faster unless you have a
fantastic connection and live very close (in an internet sense)
to SOE headquarters.

For a bard, gear isn't very important, what you need is good
instruments.  For a secondary bard, I'd go Vah Shir to get that
primary hand lute so you can put drum in off hand and not have to
juggle, barring that you can get the same effect by investing in
a Lute of the Howler.  No Focus items will work for bards, but FT
will, which means picking up a Solstice Earring Kit will help a
lot once you get over level 39 ( I think thats second charm, not
certain )

Shaman, now, the focus items do help, and I'd get all of them you
can, you'll be nuking, dotting, buffing, and healing; pretty much
the only thing you won't do is reanimate stuff (you'll even be
summoning pets, although those focus items don't mean much if you
aren't a cleric, wizard, or mage).  I'd also look for regen
items, which help a good deal up till you get Stoicism and aren't
bad even after that point.  After that, HP HP HP gear, STA too,
and if you can't find anything desirable in a given slot you
could always get some wisdom, although it matters very little
compared to focus/HP/Stamina
