Probably.

Hint: never, ever mention anybody's real email address in a usenet post
if you can possibly avoid it, or the spammers may pounce. This will
annoy the person immensely (and they may choose to return the favour).

Fortunately in this case you made an extremely common spelling mistake, so
probably no harm done.

ObEQ: interesting to see the long list of NPC dialogue fixes in the most
recent patch. Maybe somebody at Sony is noticing all the broken quests...
