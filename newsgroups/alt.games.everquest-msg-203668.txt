I've reached 55 with mine and never put a single point into cha unless it
came as a stat with some equipment I've picked up along the way.  My total
cha is 102 and I've never had a problem charming/mezzing, whatever.  My dex
otoh is almost 200 and I have *very few* missed notes.  My parser lists it a
little under 3%.  As far as sta goes, well it doesn't seem to me to add a
tremendous amount of hp.  Sure it might help you keep from getting tired as
fast, but that's what zing is for.  As far as sta helping you hold you
breath swimming, well there's plenty of eb items you can purchase.

Just my 2cp,
Sean...
