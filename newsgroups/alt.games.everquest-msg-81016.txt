Um...you might want to check out the picture of the actor who played
Legolas in the movie (can't remember his name) in this month's Us
magazine (my wife subscribes).  Then again, if you want to maintain
your fantasy regarding his fair and handsome elven appearance, maybe
you shouldn't.

Hint: it doesn't mention that he played Legolas in the picture's
caption, just that he was in LoTR. However, after a bit of scrutiny,
it's pretty obvious which character he was.
