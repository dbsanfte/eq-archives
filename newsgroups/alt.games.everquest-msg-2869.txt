Yeah, that system holds promise LOL.

If you want to PK, EQ does it right, you voluntarily sign up for it, or get
on the right server to do it.  People can't jump you out of the blue.

If you depend on the populous to report abuse of PK, you are leading to alot
of problems.  Not only are the GM's going to be swamped with whiney players
complaining all the time, but you create problems with people who abuse the
system.
