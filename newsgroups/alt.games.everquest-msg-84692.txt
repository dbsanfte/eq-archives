Looking at the 'benefits' being touted at Casters Realm...

1) New dynamic maps help chart the travels of your character with step
by step tracking of your progress through the world of Norrath and
beyond. Quickly find which zone your character is bound in, and which
zones you have or haven't visited. 

I can quickly find which zone I'm bound in now, with a simple command.
And I already know which zones I have visited. The feature *looks*
pretty, but I'm kind of baffled that they would spend coding time on
this when the engine still suffers from so many bugs.

2) Truly unique and awesome new equipment will be introduced prior to
their release on our other servers. 

Lucky players get to beta test for $40 per month instead of $10!

3) EverQuest Legends players will have a whole new way to show off
their characters and equipment - personal character pages! 

4) Part of the Legends web site, each player character will have a
personal homepage featuring all the character's statistics and items. 

Items 3 and 4 are the same, and not of any interest to me at all.


Looking at the Dynamic Server page at the Legends site, all it tells
me is that we can expect to see even fewer GM events on the regular
servers than we already do.
