At least chips are easy to come by cheaply in massive qtys now. [dumbing 
down the game I tells ya, dumbing down the game! :D ]

I tried using the ot translocator with my clr yesterday... npc didn't 
appear to respond when I was in the water... I didn't try extensively... 
I just ran around onto the dock with the text pre-typed with DA on... 
the gaurd couldn't kill me before i reached the end of the dock.

At any rate, I'm not certain you'll be able to get your TL from the 
water.
