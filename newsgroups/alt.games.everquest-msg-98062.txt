And even when you do everything right, Velk can cast his AE Lagspike, cause half 
of the raid to immediately LD, and kill the remaining folks.  (Luckily we had 2 
wizards and a monk alive, so Velk did fall.)

Heh, Kael can be tough, ToV can be really tough.  VP can cause pullers to lose 
over a yellow bubble in a night, easily.  (The yard trash is level 60-61, on a 
two minute respawn, sometimes sees invis, and can hit for up to 1500 per whack.  
Even if the boss mobs are only Kunark dragons, it's still the hardest place for 
puller exp that I know.)
