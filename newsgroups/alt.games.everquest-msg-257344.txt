My 'chanter friend apparently doesn't want to post directly
(I guess he gets too much spam as it is), but replies:

Not necessary.  Heck, Run 3 isn't necessary...and it is the first set of 
AA's most people buy.  But it improves survivability, and makes the game 
more enjoyable, and the 9th gem would do about the same for me.  I admit 
it would have made more of a difference at earlier levels than at 
65...but the same is true for Run 3.

30 slots?  I could keep illusion:gnome available at all times!

Hm, I find lots of casters in LDON's.  Much easier than other camps, 
where I seem to find all casters or all melee.

/agree

No question.  :)

Well, it's usually a caster that someone has helpfully dotted, so root 
is no good.  I want it to turn its attention to someone else.  For the 
same reason as you I don't often have blur (or boggle) loaded.

But it casts a second faster than color cloud, and if I want to PBAE I 
want to PBAE now.

I only did it once, and just for the shock value.  :)  Put it in the 
swap slot.

Nope, arcane rune is in there all the time.  I was talking about uproar, 
but most people don't know the enchanter spell line well.  I was putting 
uproar on the puller so that he would survive long enough for the bad 
cleric to heal him.  I may be a weirdo, but I'm not a rich one.  :)

[And yes, we aborted that LDON after the cleric proved he couldn't 
learn.  Pretty sure it was someone running a borrowed character.]
