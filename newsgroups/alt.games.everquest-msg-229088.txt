One thing you might consider though, is after you have your group figure the
average level.  If it is just under the cutoff level (63, 58, ...) and you
have a solid group then you may want to do a hard adventure.  If your
average is just over the cutoff then dont do a hard adventure unless you are
uber.  A hard adventure just means they bump it up one difficulty level.  So
if your group is average 58-62 it will treat you as if you were averaged
63-65.
