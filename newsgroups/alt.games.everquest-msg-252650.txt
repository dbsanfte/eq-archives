Hello!  I've been hanging around the Lake of Ill Omen quite a bit lately.  I
have heard, in the guise of my 29 troll beastlord avatar, that the iksar have a
really spiffy new claw that they hand out, and I'm trying to get in good with
them.  This involves killing sarnaks, goblins, and oh yes, the explorers in the
tower, to prove my loyalty (fleeting though it might be).  Besides, the faction
hits against the elfs and dorfs make me giggle. :)  

By now, the explorers are all green to me.  I generally wipe out the three
standing around inside then look for something else to kill until they pop back
up again like little whack-a-moles.  Imagine my surprise when I brought my bard
through recently and found *seven* on track!  

How do I get to the others?  I figure they must be on the upper floors of the
tower, but I can't see a way to get up there.  I had one (fully green, btw)
jump me when I stood around for a while, presumably by proximity aggro.  I
can't seem to draw them down reliably, though.  The walls are too sheer to
climb, and I can't figure out how to fly up there, even if I levitate.  

Please, there's a lizard in the zone who can't get enough of their cute little
boy scout knives.  Help a poor troll out, won'tcha? :)

- Gordun, 29 beastlord, Bristlebane
