Had a question for everyone.  I am thinking of GMing a tradeskill basically
simply to get the Trophy that allows you to summon bags.  Some may say this
isn't worth the effort, but hey, will make a diversion between leveling and
just kind of going on a whim.......

Anyway, my question is, in the opinion of the newsgroup, what is the easiest
tradeskill to GM.  By easiest I mean a balance between not too much farming
(unless farming the bazaar for cheap items) and not too expensive.  I know I
could get JCing up and never leave a shop but I don't want to spend that
kind of money.  I've heard that brewing and baking are both rather easy to
GM, but not sure about the 200+ areas of either.  I don't really need
recipies or plans since I'm well aware of eqtraders.com, just looking for
opinions.  By the way, already have pottery up to 122 for Thurg Potions, and
brewing is somewhere around 105 right now, baking I know I can get to 135 on
Fish Rolls in a matter of no time, if any of that helps.

Thanks for any suggestions.
