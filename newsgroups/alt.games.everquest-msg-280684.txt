Kind of out of the blue there guy.  

But to address what you say here.  Since I have a level 60 pally in WoW and 
had leveled a druid to 60 in EQ I assure you that I had an order of 
magnitude less time playing time in WoW than in Everquest to level to 60.  
Even with the new expansions, which would significantly cut down the time 
to level in EQ, the time to make 60 is substantially less.  Probably just a 
consequence of the focus of WoW, which is to make it so you can do the PvP 
on the PvP servers and still make progress.  As a result the level on the 
PvE servers, which have voluntary PvP that most people do at least some of, 
is very fast indeed.  Don't know if that is better or worse, its just the 
way it is.

Amazing arrogance, telling me what is fun in a game in a manner that looks 
like the pope speaking ex cathedra.  And you folks thought that the Sony 
people didn't post here.

Not to mention that, even accepting your pronouncement on what is and isn't 
fun (which I don't) you completely ignore the second half of the sentence I 
wrote "and rescue people in trouble" which I assure you is interacting with 
them. And ignore the previous paragraph. Just out of curiosity are you 
saying that not holding your own in a fight (dieing) is what you find to be 
fun or is it the "casual" part of interacting that you object to?
