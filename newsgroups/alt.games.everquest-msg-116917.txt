For melee characters at least it has to be Shaman I think, assuming
level 60.

Regrowth of Dar Khura, 15 points per tick regen
Focus, 405-430 added HPs
Celerity, 50% haste
Talisman of the Brute, +50 STA

They can do *much* more of course but those are the ones that hit the
spot for me.  That and slowing mobs to a crawl, heh.

Having said that Aego (Cleric) and Shissar/Visions of Grandeur [and
Koadic's Endless Intellect for hybrids] (Enchanter) are very addictive
buffs.
