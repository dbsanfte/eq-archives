LOL!  Could be.  Much funner was the conversation I watched today:

10:44:47 - nottoobrightwarrior shouts, 'can i get a sow'
10:49;20 - nottoobrightwarrior shouts, 'can i get a sow'
10:50:01 - nottoobrightwarrior shouts 'CAN I GET A SOW PLZ
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'
10:50:14 - nottoobrightwarrior shouts, 'can i get a sow'
10:50:31 - helpfulsoul1 says out of character, 'I'd guess the answer
is 'no', nottoobrightwarrior...'
10:50:55 - helpfulsoul2 says out of character 'you spamming you want a
sow doesn't help you nottoobrightwarrior'
10:51:30 - nottoobrightwarrior says out of character, 'but theresa 44
driud here'

I tried to talk Cel into sowing him, but she seemed reluctant :D
