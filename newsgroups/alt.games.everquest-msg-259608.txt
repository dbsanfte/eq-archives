    Update: we killed PXK last night. :-)

    That's because the southern snake doesn't pop it's devastating tricks
until 30% or so. We did the same last night. ;-) One of the fastest complete
wipes I've ever seen, as one person did the one thing you should never do at
that point. It was late and we had no reserves outside, so we had to coffin
out of Txevu!

    They don't have the numbers to field 70, even though they're two merged
guilds. The leader of one of the two prior guilds is slowly but surely
driving away everyone, same as what happened with the last guild they were
leading.

    I couldn't tell you. Near as I can tell, it's mostly because by the time
we kill any primary target it's so late we can't do secondary stuff. For
example, last night we killled M'shas, cleared through Txevu, took forever
to finally make mutton of the goat, then had one shot at PRT before it was
past 11 PM PST and had to go back out to Qvic to clear M'shas again and hold
up our part of the rotation out there.

    Yes, the other guild had had their chance and failed. It wasn't our turn
for any of the mobs in Txevu - they're all on rotation, even the ones no
guild kills (ukun/ikaav). It wasn't too bad - we got a blessed shard off one
of the primals, then did CBQ and completed two quests off her drops plus one
mask. But it's no Tacvi.

    Give me a dumb 80/80/80/3% aug any day, thanks! We also want a fair
number of leggings, mostly for casters, and we're trying to get all our
monks in robes. :-)

    Found out part of the problem on the second to last attempt last night -
the AE was blowing the next warrior on a switch into the wrong corner, and
they wouldn't leave it for fear of messing up placement.

    Yes, it was Hattle. ;-)

    The warrior that finished off PXK was actually our smallest warrior. We
had two more warriors ready behind her, but didn't need them - gnome > goat!

    That's not all. Let's just say there used to be more adds, and leave it
at that. ;-)
