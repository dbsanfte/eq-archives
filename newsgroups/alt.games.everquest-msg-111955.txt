I thought that KC and HS hurt Cabilis faction, but now that you mention 
it, I guess it only hurts Overthere faction.  My mistake.

This I also did not know.  I generally stay away from leezardtown, 
especially since my crazy necro GM is on hiatus.  He was bound by the 
firepots for a LONG time, so he just ran through Cabilis almost any time 
he needed to get somewhere on Kunark.  He got familiar with the city, and 
would often take several of us on rather terrifying shortcuts.
