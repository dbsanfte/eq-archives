Well, the rating was not solely based on the dark elf faction difficulties.
Before the broken golem, this would be a 1 rating, because of the insanity
of getting the CT drop. Still not an easy quest. I may raise it to 4 tho,
as with servers maturing, a lot of wizards who are not in uber guilds are
getting shots at the venril sathir staff, since all the uber guild wizards
are done with it.

My understanding of the rune effect was that it only applied to magical
damage. If it works on melee too, then yes, that would be a ratings bump.

Completely forgot about DMF. Fixed.

Fixed.

Not really a factor for this rating.

My impression of DA was that the mob kept hitting you. DA falls more into
the damage absorb category than damage avoid.

They would. Forgot about MoK. Fixed.

Fixed.

Which contributes to their 10 rating in damage absorb :)

Fixed based on weapon procs. The rarity of being able to use most
disciplines prevents them from affecting the ratings much. Besides, a
warrior is far better off using riposte on VS.

Fixed.

Well, a large portion of monks are lizards (far greater percentage than any
other class that lizards can be), and lizards have problems getting up the
faction to do the headband quests. Plus, the Raster camp is *so* bad.

There is also the spell they get that imbues their weapon with a lifetap
proc which I had forgotten about. Fixed.

It isn't what they *want* to do, it is what they *can* do that makes up
this rating.

Probably still keep it at 4, due to gimpy mana pool. Ranger healing is
primarily downtime reduction.

Snare has its own category, due to its importance.

Relying on owning the epic is not a good method of determining debuff
skills. Might raise this to 4 based on the epic, and several of the
debuffing velious weapons. Jury still out here.

>> Downtime Reduction: 0

Going to raise this, based on choloplast, and their healing being primarily
downtime in nature.

>> Epic Power: 8, ranger epics are incredibly good.

Downside to having 2 weapons is that the stat bonuses (and resist bonuses)
are also split. Not bad if you are wielding both, but if you are in a major
guild and are raiding ToV North, or Sleeper's, then there are a number of
weapons with hugely better Dam/Dly stats than the epics. So to switch out,
you'd either be losing your slow ability, or have to get your haste back.
Not a disaster if you have some dragon haste, or a PoA quest belt, but it
is a limiting factor. Still, most rangers will NOT get a shot at ToVN, or
ST, so it isn't such a huge disaster :)
