I'm going to say this one more time. No one got dropped from their isp
that I'm aware of. If an isp was to drop someone because some little
kiddies complained then then go find one that sees usenet for what it
is, a cry room. There are many Isp's that will let you do anything short
of a felony.
What is the humility you speak of and who got this humility? If one
feels humility from what people say in a ng then you are a mentally
disturbed person. fact is, those who's self extreme was so incredibly
low that they felt the need to tell on others are the suffering ones.
Way I see it Lokari is a fatass and I am responsible for telling the
internet world about it. There is your humility Lokari.
If you claim to have removed people that are still here and posting it
is you that has lost the battle of whatever credibility you had claimed
to have. Now you will reap the consequences of being seen as a fatass.
