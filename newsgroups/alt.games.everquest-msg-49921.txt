I browsed your site and I offer that if that post were to come from
you a dog would give birth to a cat. I am confident that the forger
wil get his/her comeuppance in due time.

On another note. Your pages about dimensional geometry are very
interesting. Bioelectromagnetic plant mutation is my hobby at present,
and I am searching for a vehicle of description that is most suited to
the work. I use the math of trigonometry, resonances, fractals and
ratios to set up the enmeshed heterodyne energy fields that I
vizualize, but I lack the language to clearly communicate those
constructs that have proven to be effective for the purpose of genetic
alteration.  The "Journal of Irreproducible Results" will be my only
venue if an effective language is not developed. Your email
suggestions and questions are welcome.
