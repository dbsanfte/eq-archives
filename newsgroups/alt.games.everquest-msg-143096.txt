Then don't.  You've certainly read about faction.  You just
made a (bad) assumption that you would have sufficient faction
due to your class.  Now that you know that you don't, find out
how to raise it and raise it sufficiently to go buy it yourself.
That's ONE way you're "supposed" to do it.

The other way, in a multi-player environment, is to pay someone
to do something you can't.  You'll eventually want a port that
you can't do yourself, and will buy it.  Or a rez that you can't
do, and will buy it.  And so on.  It's a multi-player game and
it's perfectly acceptable to trade with other players.

And, believe it or not, MOST low-level characters would jump at
the chance to earn 5pp by running and getting the spell for you.
And MOST of the ones who don't care about the 5pp wouldn't care
about ripping you off for 20pp.   Simply finding one in a guild
is often enough, especially if the guild has a few high-level
players on.  (/who all guild_name tells you that.)
