  No tale of uberness here...just a nice little thing that happened to 
me today. I was idly reading through the list of quests available in the 
Plane of Knowledge, and I came across the one for the Beginner Magic 
Manual (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2218). 
  Fifteen minutes later, I handed my Planar Traveler's Manual and some 
hobgoblin surprise (bought in the Bazaar) to Acomar Lothwol, and became 
the proud owner of a shiny new Beginner Magic Manual...which, since it 
replaced my musty old Small Wisdom Deity from about two years ago, was a 
welcome change. Yay, me. =)

I didn't mean to offend you. Should I like, change my

I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. BITE ME HARD!"
