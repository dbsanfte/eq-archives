Yeah, you won't be able to leave the villages and hit the city until you're 
a citizen. What race did you pick and thus starting town? If you're on 
Beta2, send a /tell sometime to Regnor, the character I'm currently working 
on.

Don't know, haven't upgraded my Inn room yet. I did some City Quests and 
over an intense weekend of questing earned anough Status Points to buy a 
horse and a nicer apt, but the damned server lost all my SP on a crash and I 
never got motivated enough to go back and earn them again, so I have no idea 
what the bigger houses offer.

I traveled to Nek forest last night and grouped with some ebils out there. 
One of them had a Spectral Steed, which is a horse that looks like a ghost. 
Holy crap it was gorgeous and fast as hell. The guy paid 72g for it (that 
was not a typo). I inspected him and sure enough, Armorer 26. Armorers 
always make all the money ...

Heading back in now. Here's hoping they did not instance Antonica ...
