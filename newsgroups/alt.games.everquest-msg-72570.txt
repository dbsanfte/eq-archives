You just didn't know what you were doing and gave up before figuring that
out.

-if you can't kill a blue, you are not playing your profession properly.
Either you're not using a style, not casting correctly, or using green
armor/weapons.  Using a green weapon will get you killed constantly --
REGARDLESS of profession.  Using green armor will get you killed constantly
if you are a melee class.

-sprint works.  Sprint works on stamina.  If you use up most of your stamina
during combat (ie: you decide to run at the last minute), sprint is
worthless.

-most mobs in DAOC are not social at low levels, so I really question the
authenticity of this whole post; especially in conjuction with the
ridiculous sprint comment.
