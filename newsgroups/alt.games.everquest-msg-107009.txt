If you cannot create and level a tank without ubergear then my guess is you
don't know enough about the game to use that character when you get it to
high levels where the gear is now usable.  All this will do, if Verant
carries through with it, is make it impossible for a few selfish and
irresponsible high levels to dominate a zone with a twink and spoil the game
for the other players who go about playing without the benefit of ubergear.
Most such twinks know little about playing their class have poorly developed
skills and generally depend on their equipment to make up for their lack of
knowledge and skill and ultimately cause more trouble than they are worth.
