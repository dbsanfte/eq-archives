my attempts to download the eqgame.exe file are all halting at
the exact same spot (well, within a second or two in a 5 minute
estimated block) and also result in a jump from under 5% CPU
usage to a 99% CPU usage which will continue for at least
an hour (longest I've let it run to see if something would happen)

This looks to me like a glitch in the patcher, not in the server..
surely if I"m unable to get information from the server, my
CPU usage would drop, not rise, wouldn't it?
