I'll give you the fact that Blizzard has lousy reliability on Release dates and
that you may be right about that 3 year release but THEY say they will have it
out by Christmas of 2002. Which leads me to beleive it will be out by Q2 of
2003. So yeah, it's a long way off.

Agreed, I started in this field as an Alpha and Beta tester for a game Called
the REalm. Everquest is FAR superior to that, and I've YET to see a product
that's even come close to everquests superiority in this field.  DAoC looks
like it's going to be the first one to really take up the battleaxe, I know
it's the first one I'm gonna try to break my EQ habit on.

Agreed also, in most cases.
