Why do you do that?

Im not saying give it to any random begging spammer in the zone.. but that
seems a pretty mean self-centered attitude.

Have you never ooc'd in a zone that your looking for <a quest piece> and
offered something in exchange for looting it?  Maybe you haven't.. but a lot
of people do.

Shrug its your choice.. just seems a lil mean to me.. "if i cant have it
nobody is having it!"
