In fact, number 0 on all of my hotkey pages consists of:

/doability (SH)
/pause 10(i think, whatever the SH ungrey time is), /loc
/doability (SH)
/pause 10(i think, whatever the SH ungrey time is), /loc

This gives me two different sets of coords a uniform distance apart, so I 
can triangulate where I am and where I am heading, and it keeps my SH 
maxed.

Hell, I am better at geometry after a year of EQ than I was after 4 years 
of high school :)
