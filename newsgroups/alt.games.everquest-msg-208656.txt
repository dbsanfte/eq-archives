Dinner, a movie, and a little blue pill?  Please, even at my patheticly
frequency level here (not a personal choice, wife's drive is at about 1/100ths
mine) this runs more than EQ per month.

Or there's hookers, the slightest bit of research on this would show you that
you'd spend more per one shot than I do on EQ for a year.

Pfft, sex.

Now assuming a free and willing partner, (or that you solo) still, how much of
your day do you really expect to eat up on sex?  EQ (or books) will fill all
available time!
