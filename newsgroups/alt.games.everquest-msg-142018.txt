    And throw away everything I've worked hard to get on my current main?
No, of course not. It's not even an option. And that's the point - it's not
even an option. Even if I wanted to become a shaman or a druid, I'd have to
give up what I've achieved and work my way back up again. Given the
constraints in the raiding game, I'd never get on par with the level I'm at
now. That's why people defend their classes so passionately.

    They already do. When my guild asks for a cleric to go somewhere, it's
because that area is too tough for them to bot a cleric there. These areas
usually aren't so hot for XP, and what loot is there is usually for the
person who asked me to go. So to summarize: come help me, OK got what I
want, going to PL myself with my bot, toodles. If they DO want a live person
to come heal them, they want someone that can up their DPS and let them kill
faster - and that isn't me.
