I succumbed to temptation yesterday and made a high elf girl wizard
twink wearing black leather (shardtooth's flayed skin, drake scale legs,
gatorscale arms, impskin gloves); but I have yet to find suitable shoes
and bracers. I'm trying to find something that keeps the same look that
the vendors/trainers in the Felwithe caster guilds wear. The aqua blue
of the wolf fur slippers she's currently wearing clashes most
unattractively. =P Anyone have any suggestions?
