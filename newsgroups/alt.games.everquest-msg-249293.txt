That's obviously not what I'm talking about. Can you even comprehend what 
capacity for evil would be required to do to a human being with your bear 
hands what these beasts did to Nick Berg?! It *is* different from shooting, 
hanging, poisoning or blowing him up.

There is killing a person to make a point, then there is killing someone 
with a fanatic zeal and savage brutality.

Take the typical wartime soldier. They'll kill the enemy all day long 
through conventional means, rifle, bayonet, grenade, etc. However, how many 
do you think could actually bring themselves to run up, grab a bound and 
screaming enemy and saw through their necks, holding the head up as a 
trophy when finished? 

The kind of person who is capable of doing such a thing is not just a 
murderer, but a monster.
