The problem being, there are a LOT of those people.  I was starting to 
doubt my *own* grouping abilities for awhile when I was fighting in 
Oasis.  Then I moved to LOIO and it only got worse.  When I started 
hunting aviaks in SK it got much, much better and my fears disappeared.  
Only problem being the aviaks are still almost all red to me, and it's 
difficult to find a group willing to let someone level 19 in.  It's nice, 
though.  Don't think I ever met a train in that area.
