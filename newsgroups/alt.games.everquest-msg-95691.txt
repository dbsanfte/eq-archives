Hmm, I don't know of any equipment that negatively impacts faction, so I 
doubt that's it.  I would be looking at deity maybe.  Have you even been 
to BB before?  Are you sure you weren't KOS to begin with?  Do you worship 
Rallos Zek?  
I suspect that if it's not a diety related issue, you have some bug.  I 
would /petition and see if the GM can help.  If you get a guide, even a 
senior guide, and they don't resolve it to your satisfaction, ask to have 
it escalated to the server GM.
