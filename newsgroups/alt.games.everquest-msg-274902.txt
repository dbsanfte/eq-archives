I've been getting word from my guildie who knows a programmer that EQ1
will be getting some majoe overhaul this summer.  About 45% of all
zones will be getting some facelifts (probably like Lavastorm a while
ago) and lots of new quests.  The facelift will be done just before
the next expansion comes out mid summer.  Overall it will make EQ1
graphics in line with EQ2

I don't know about the expansion as DoN is just coming out soon but if
this is all true, it'd be a great way to try and get players back.
Those on dialup would have to wait a long time to download updates and
those who still uses older computer or outdated graphic card may need
to upgrade.

Also some servers will merge (not the PvP) but what merges depends on
the server's population.

Oh yeah it was mentioned there are currently 1.3 million EQ1
subscribers.  That's more than I thought.
