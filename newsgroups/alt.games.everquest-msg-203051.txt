Amazingly enough, those same plains are a great place for a Druid in
his/her teens, NOT jacked up on KEI.  Really.  I've done two of them
recently, untwinked (though I do have the advantage of substantial
game knowledge due to being a veteran player).  Great place to solo.
But there's a world of difference between solo and group play, and...

One of the biggest differences between solo and group play is that
group play is (usually) one whole heck of a lot less boring.  Unless,
of course, you get sucked into a group of mindless power-gamers who
sit in one spot mindlessly killing the same mob(s) over and over and
over again with no conversation worthy of the name taking place.  But,
if that happens, guess what?  You're a Druid!  Norrath is your oyster.
Go somewhere else and find something fun to do.

Ack.  You couldn't be more wrong.  You can put a damage shield
on the tank, you can buff AC and HP, you can heal, out of doors
you can SoW, you have your first swarm-type DoT already (these
DoTs are among the most mana efficient damage spells in the game
because of the huge (-100) resist modifier), you can snare to
stop mobs from running for help.  Druids are tremendously group
friendly at any level, and at low level they are often preferred
over Clerics by groups.  In fact, we used to see a lot of whining
by low level Clerics in this group, that they could never get in
a group because the groups always took a Druid or Shaman.

Or maybe not.  Effective Enchanters are generally pretty imaginative
players, and you're not coming across as very imaginitaive here.

Suggestion:  Stop whining and find people to group with.  And be sure
you pick up the spell "Lesser Succor" for when you hit L19, it's one
of the nicest things you have to offer in a lowbie dungeon group.

You would (apparently) be amazed at how much stimulation 5 other
players in your group can add to your gaming experience.

And you're so damned intent on not caring that you ignore every bit
of useful information that you could be gleaning from those who've
already walked the path you're on.  Go on then, leave.  I can assure
you that EQ will survive the loss of another whiny brat, we've got
plenty more.  Or lose the childish attitude, accept that whether or
not _you_ have fun is almost entirely _your_ responsibility, and go
learn some of the things about EQ that keep so many players so loyal
after all the years and all the bugs and all the assholes who've
tried to fuck up our time in game.
