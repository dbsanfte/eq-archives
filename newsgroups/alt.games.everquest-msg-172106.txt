    No, and no.

    Yes, it's silly. You say that you'd have defaulted if an awesome SHM
item had dropped. Question: do any awesome SHM items drop in the camp you
were in? Any SHM items worth 45 K on your server? So why would he want to go
to a camp where you, because of your class, can get so much more than he
can?

    NBG works with friends that want to improve each other. NBG works with
regular play groups, where it is assumed over time everyone will come out
roughly the same in terms of loot. NBG doesn't work with strangers in pickup
groups. They have no reason to want to improve your character, only their
own. That means either not doing NBG, and hoping for lucky rolls, or only
going places where items you want drop and doing NBG.
