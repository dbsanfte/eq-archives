I don't really agree that the higher the price the better it will sell.
If you look at the top sales for games most are in the lower price braket.
Deer hunter was top of the charts for months, the who wants to be a
milionare, and cheap games like froger.  All of these games were half the
price of EQ when they first came out and sold thousands of copies

Alot of game sales are made from inpulse buys and a game that is priced
lower will get bought 9 times out of 10 over the more expensive one.

Also, I agree that a game that is priced less is not placed in the same
places as the more expensive one's, however when it starts to sell better
then the others it soon will be.
