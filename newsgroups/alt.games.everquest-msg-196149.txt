Problem with that position is that most people like the changes.  I'm not
saying that from a "we got more votes" perspective, but really *that* is
your problem.  If there were more people like you then it wouldn't be a
problem.  You could just group up with others that agree with your viewpoint
and go your merry way without any effect on gameplay.  But you can't do that
because NO ONE WANTS TO DO IT YOUR WAY.  You can't find 5 other people in
game that agree with you that the game is better when you don't use kei.
