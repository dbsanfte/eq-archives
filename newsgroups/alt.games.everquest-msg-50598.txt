"As you get to know and care about these people, it gets harder and

I don't think that is too challenging a logic leap. Unless you can
ruthlessly cut out the people in your life whenever your selfish needs
aren't being met.

Projection?

No. My opinion was formed from a very large number of posts on the
subject of departing Everquest, on this forum and others. These are the
sort of posts that you are notorious for retorting to with some gaiety
along the lines of "Don't let the door hit you in the ass when you fuck
off and die." 

From reading the departures of strangers and friends I did notice a
prevailing trend amongst those who left; that they are fed up with or
simply can't stand the game itself, and the only thing that kept them
there for so long are their friends and the people. The few concocted
troll posts and the posts from people leaving through being ostracised
due to their actions are too insignificant to approach being defended as
a majority.

My implication that you don't care about anyone but yourself was too
subtle?

You took it upon yourself to defend the interests of the majority by
denouncing my opinion, after which you injuredly appointed yourself it's
representative. 

That is precisely the sort of action that gets up people's noses [1].
Unless I'm being arrogantly presumptuous here, and your endless
consternation about being followed around by trolls is some kind of
Narcissistic delusion on my part. Still, I really don't have my own fan-
club of kooks. You do, as you are want to point out whenever the
opportunity for self-aggrandisement presents itself. 

You just wanted another bun-fight. I humoured you, and David too. I
guess I just care too much.

[1] Much like my euphuistic posting style. Ah well.
