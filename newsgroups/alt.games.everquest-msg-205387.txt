Verant was to incompitent to allow for the laws of physics to apply to
anyo0ne other than us. They won't drown. (to easy to get XP that way
and god forbid we get any breaks.) And as the other guy put it. mobs
fly up and over trees, Buildings.. threw walls, etc.  But i do think
the water slows them a bit. i had a nice long train once with my necro
and his J-boots. On land they kept up with him pretty well. but once i
got over the water i started to pull away from them. I also noticed
(though it doesn't always seem to work.) If you get them over the path
the boat takes. It's like the current catchs them and drags them out
to sea following the boat's path. even with my boots i couldn't keep
up well enough to cast but maybe a sower can run past dot etc. they
werenot able to get out of this last i saw. but might be fixed by now.
haven't bothered to try in a while.
