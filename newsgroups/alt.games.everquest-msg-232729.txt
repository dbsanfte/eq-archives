In article <JM%Pb.20426$q4.5154@newsread3.news.atl.earthlink.net>, 
hughesiv@earthlink.net says...

> No when you try to ration something it causes scarcity.

You have your causality reversed. The rationing is caused by the 
scarcity, not the other way around. I think you mean to say that 
rationing helps artificially inflate demand, which is something else 
altogether. But I'm not a mind-reader, so I don't know if that is indeed 
what you meant to say.

<boggle>
Now you're making even less sense. Why must they all sell none? As far 
as I can tell, they can sell all they can for a buck. And where did 
"every other man like him" come from? The example being argued was a 
monopoly, if I recall correctly. That means there is only one owner to 
begin with. Can you explain what you mean?

I'm not sure one can trust the veracity of conclusions based on a 
demonstrably erroneous assertion, like the one made at the beginning of 
your article.
