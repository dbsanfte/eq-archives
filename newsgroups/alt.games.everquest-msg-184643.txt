Bottom line, your computer is too slow and you don't have enough memory.
The video card is ok but a Geforce 4 would be better. The game has added
a lot of new graphics (textures, models, etc.)

You should have at least 512 Mb of memory now and and I wouldn't play
with anything less than a 1 Ghz chip in it.

You can try turning off all the new models etc. in the options screen
from the main menu. Turn texture compression on.

No its default now.
