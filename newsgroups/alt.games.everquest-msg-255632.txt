It's not an unreasonable desire. It's just an unreasonable expectation. No 
MMOG has been able to successfully provide an immersive gameplay experience 
of any sort of depth without any level of tedium or significant time 
expendature.

Your time is the only effective tender for progression in this type of 
game. Face it, if the game were easy or the rewards quickly attainable, we 
wouldn't play it.

It is quite the conundrum.
