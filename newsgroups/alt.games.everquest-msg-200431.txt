Definitely not. This all reads like a fairy tale to me. I guess you
actually work for 989studios not to have comms problems.

I have a lvl 37 bard, which is my main and first character. The main
time I use charm is to "taunt" a mob off one of the other support cast.
It works beautifully for this.

Bard charm is so unreliable that you take significant damage from
anything of useful experience. Yes, I have maxxed instrument skills all
around. As well, it cripples your song casting as the song only lasts 3
tics and the slighest comms problem and your thumped good and proper.


-------------------
Yes, I have to agree with you.  (I'm a lvl 38 Bard - never been P/L'ed - 1st
Main Char. - have a few low level caster alts - but not as fun as a bard.)
When I use charm and try the method above, charm will break and I'll get
wholloped.  Normally I can escape with Selo's if I don't get stunned too
often or I'm near a zone line but it's best to use it in a group to get an
add off a tank..... but then you could mezz it instead....  Charm's shitty
cause it breaks after about 30 sec. max unless you're real lucky and unless
it recharms first go next tick you hammered by the aggro'd mob - and man are
they aggro'ed or what!!  I like fear kiting much better cause you can play
"Chains" and "Agnostic Screech" together so they don't chase after you and
hammer you as much.  Maybe Charming works much better over a cable
connection??  My modem connection reply time is about 300ms.  If it goes
above about 600ms I give up for the night and tradeskill or something else
that doesn't involve twisting songs cause it's too damn annoying /
dangerous.
