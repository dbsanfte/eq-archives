I'm saying that they should continue to do as they have been
doing.  Keep fixing things.  Keep revamping.  Keep making
new content.

Don't stop one aspect and rush another, both (all three) are
important.   And I strongly suspect that all three require
different skill sets anyway.

This poll suggests that we must pick between repair and
new content... when thats not been the case in the past.

If the game generated cash only on initial sale, I could
see this making sense.  But instead, it continues to
generate cash monthly.  Taking a portion of the incoming
cash and putting it into development seems like the
logical approach, since development keeps players
paying the next month, and the next, and so forth.

Only when you predict the game is going to die anyway
does it make sense to stop plowing that seed corn
back in to raise next month's crop with... now you
just cash in month after month till you aren't making
enough money to justify keeping the servers running.

I don't see anything out there to indicate this has
even started to happen... except for this poll.
