No, actually, as seen, the choice you made is what is noticed here.

...But you just said you took the angle that "I" was biting on, no ??
(and there is a point to why I pointd this out you know)

Let say for a moment that I did indeed agree with you in that you
are born with it, even though I do not.

This does little to forward your position.  Say you had it stamped
on your birth certificate, again, what business does it have in a 
NON sexual setting like at work, school, etc ??

Agreed.

Yea, I have that flaw about me, and something I'd like to work on.

what makes it hard is the "definition" of "discriminate", and this
very visable attempts by your type to "streeeeeeth" the definition.
To "not" decriminate" 100%, one would have to accept them as not
different in ANY facet of life, and society, which is something
that you very *much* want.  I on the other hand want to meet you
in the middle somewhere, and only ensure this in things that have
tangable implications WHILE holding you to "some" personal responsibility
for your actions, behaviour, born in sexual prefeences and the like.
Bottom line: you are not gay ALL of the time, you *are* responsable
for the actions/behaviours you choice and how they will be socially
addresses.  If a guy walks around the city in a dress, he's gonna
get snarals. If he walks around town in normal attire, and only
wares dresses at home, then its a win-win, he gets to wear dresses
AND not get snarls. But you want *both*, and thats selfish, and
not resposible, and calls for you to make a tradeoff.  If the
drive to wear dresses in plubic is so strong, then the cost of
public snarls is minimual. Entrophy lives !

Maybe not, but if confused, not hard to figure out how that pecker works.
(we don't come with an instruction book rubber banded to our forehead
when we come out of our mom's shoot, but obvious we don't need one)

And easy to see that birds are not equiped to go bowling.

Entrophy here...  You want free variation, and even though
Mother Nature is a pretty cool babe, even she can't afford 
to give away free variations.  If you "like" that variation
so much, fine, knock yourself out, just do due dilligence 
in paying for it.

Its not the variation that your after, it the changing of the social
norms (for *any* reason) that you're after I see.

  How'd I know that this statement was coming?  Can we say "PC" ?

You refuse to offer up any personal responsibility for *any* 
thing that you do, so doubtfull that I would be attracted
as a frined.

No, I'd actually be FOR a situation whereby EACH employee got ONE
additional benifit package per household for ANY use.  That way
You can use it for a gay partner, I can use it for a wife, and
others can use if for a siter/brother, or mother.  By suspicion
is that you would somehow fight that because it does *not* single
you out as having something more special as to be noticed.

Dunno huh?...  Just like that "dunno"...  shows REAL commitment
on your part for the issue as a "whole" huh?  Yea, look out for
ME, but forget about the general cause.  That attitude contribures
to the animosity thatyou folks get.

The question to you is this: If you were not gay, would you still
fight the cause to this degree?  Better yet, why not fight the
battle with the angle of keeping ALL sexual preference out of the
workplace etc.
