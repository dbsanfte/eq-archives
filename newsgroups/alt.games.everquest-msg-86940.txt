 Hmm, sent that before I was done... Anyway, once you get the key from
the North Wing named you can hop on the pad which sends you back to the
zone-in spot. Then you use your key you got from the North named to open
the West door. Once you get the West key you can go to the South. The
key to get to East wing is a ground spawn in the South wing. Be aware
that the pad at the end of South wing puts you outside in the scorpion
canyon and not at the zone-in spot. You get to the East by an invisible
door in the wall in the teleport-out room.
