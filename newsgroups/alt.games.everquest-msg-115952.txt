 I don't have a problem with real newbies. When they take on the role of
beggars is where my patience begins to wear thin.

 I still run wherever I go unless a guildie happens to be going the same
way for a raid or something. If I need to get to Easter Wastes, for
example, I'll run to a Luclin spires, port to Nexus then port down to GD
and run to EW. Could I do without it? Sure. But it's part of the game so
it doesn't bug me that much.

 Depends on what sort of guild you have. Most members of midgame guilds
will still need to rely on pickup groups for the most part.

 As opposed to talking to people I don't like? At 60 I still join the
occassional pickup group and talk to those people.

 Have never used the word "Prat" yet. Maybe I need to play more.

 Newbies are fine. We were all newbies at some point. On the other hand
beggar newbies suck.
