Websters lists the word without a plural, which is their space saving default
for when there is no accepted pluralization of it aside from the same word.  For
example, the normal plural of "deer" is "deer", but it is also rarely pluralized
as "deers", so the dictionary lists that one. Looks like the plural is "shaman".
