Just had to say Verant really sux cos they have a Pet limit on Target.. I
dont understand why..

Lets say we have 10 MAG with there level 60 pets and let say they was enable
to kill anything big with 10 petas all hitting a pet..

It would still be nothing compared to what 5 Wizards can do with manaburn..

And cos high end game mobs are from 60 to level 70 and Necro pet 47 and MAG
pet 49 they Miss ALOT during figths..

Soo... Whats the point of not letting all PET do there damage..?

For me its just scrappy of Verant to keep the Pet limit.
