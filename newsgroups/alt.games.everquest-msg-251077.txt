Sitting reading a Gamespot interview and preview of EQ2. For once a preview 
that has some release date posted as August 2004 (preview dated 13 June 
2004).

Now I started wondering, we all know that SoE had run internal beta on EQ2, 
also that Stormhammer players will be the first players to get access to 
beta (if they aren't already online), and that the rest will get to know 
end of this month if we got access.

Know this only leaves 1-2 months of open beta and bug chasing, of course if 
we are optimistic and says no more postpone of release date. 2 months can 
be a long period, but still this open beta smells more like a marketing 
stunt than the word itself.
