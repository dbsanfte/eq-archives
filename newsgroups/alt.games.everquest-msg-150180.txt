I had an old character who was a level 4 necro and wanted to delete this 
character so i could reuse the name.
But after i deleted then created the new character it wouldnt accept the 
name!
I had deleted the character which had previously been accepted so why 
isnt this wrking now?
Worse still, and this i founf hilarious, is in the end i thought lets 
test this but getting it to generate me a name and it even rejected the 
name IT suggested! lol
I have reported it as a bug but as Verant tech support is none existent 
and the in game admins  pointless i thought id post it here to see if 
anyone else had similar problems and if anyone knew a work around

thanks

Az
