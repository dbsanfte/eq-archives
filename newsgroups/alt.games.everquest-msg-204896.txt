FWIW, I did my first swimming in S. Felwithe. Did some fishing afterwards
and finished up by making fish sticks on the spit. Next time I went swimming
was by accident. Fell into the moat at Crushbone three times in one night.
Nothing like having an Orc Legionnaire on your tail to encourage you to
learn to swim. Died once. All in all, I'd say Felwithe was better, but I
think I actually increased my ability more in CB.
