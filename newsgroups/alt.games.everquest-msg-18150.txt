Not ever lived in a city or country you didn't grow up in and had to learn,
by your mistakes, your way around.

Ahh so as a caster, you don't have to take a piss? I didn't realise you
meant that taking a piss was the Melee equivalent of looking at a spell
book.

No you were complaining about more than just the spell book, you want more
spell gems, an automapper, a health bar for your pet and a hot key nanny
incase you press the wrong key at an inappropriate moment.

Why? You think I haven't done it? I've harm touched myself instead of
binding once, didn't happen again as I moved Bind wound to another page
after that, I wonder how many casters can give stories of how they rooted
themselves, not seen any suggest that the ability to make that mistake
should be removed from the, sure it'd be easier if they did but people
accept it as their own error.

So, let me get this straight, you think, because of the challenge set
against you as a PC, whatever class you play,  this game is boring because
you can't do what you want. I mean you should be able to wear plate armour
and dual wield swords too, just becasue you're a caster doesn't mean you
haven't got an interest in physical combat.

No point discussing because if my warrior was equal to a Mob of his level in
Melee then I and all other Tanks would just solo.
Since you have snipped and missquoted selected parts of my posts I don't see
any reason why I shouldn'e be facetious in my replies.

Well you either learn to deal with it or quit playing before 35th, or email
your complaint to Verant, then quit.

No, godmode because you seem to want it all, now, You lose the spell book at
35, that isn't  "High" that is "Mid" level

I can melee, as I a Warrior I am "Master of melee" but I have trouble with
mobs 10 levels lower than me and any closer I'm prolly dead...that's a
penalty. The fact that I have no magic ability is not, it's my choice.

> PS: Spellbook

Yes, well I'll think of you struggling with your spell book while medding.
My prayers are with you.
