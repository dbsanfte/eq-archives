I honestly don't know if we're caster heavy or not, although we do have a
lot of mages and wizards and chanters and stuff.  But they get the job
done - now that we have the strategy down, takes us about 20-25 minutes to
kill Emp.  I think all of our tanks have proc'ing weapons that do good
damage while the casters nuke and dot, so the relatively small number of
banes doesn't hurt us.  Still, we'd certainly be able to do it more quickly
and with fewer people if we had more banes.  What's keeping us from the "no
banes = no emp loot" policy is that our interest in Emp and Vex Thal is only
moderate right now; most people want to do PoP stuff.  I myself need to get
Tactics-enabled so I can clean up on that mad XP everyone keeps talking
about.  =)

Wow, that's a harsh policy.  =)  You'd have to be quite confident in your
numbers to be able to set up something like that.  I'm not sure that my
guild is.

Heh, wow.  You were just unlucky, I suppose.

I think I know how you feel.  Whenever I whined about the ME shard, one guy
in my guild kept saying "Yeah, took me a whole hour to get my ME shard!"  I
wanted to throttle him, in a friendly sort of way.  =)

Yeah, maybe.  Our server's uber-guild posted a scathing update on their web
page after we got our first Emp kill.  They talked about how we were overly
proud of killing a Luclin mob while they had moved on to PoP, and that our
kill was made easier by the 40% slow and the addition of more hitpoints for
our tanks.  So yeah, PoP does indeed make Emp more accessible.  Kinda like
AoW used to be *so* hard to kill, and now we wax him regularly without
breaking a sweat.  (Although last time he dropped three war bows, which had
us scrambling to get alts to Kael to loot them.  Bleah.)

Hehe, yeah.  It was another place I couldn't get a group to come help me
with, either.

No argument from me.  It's LoIO with traps.

Jeeze, talk about rude.

Ah, the worst possible combination... rude *and* incompetent.

!!  I'll say!  If you can get them to stay for hours and hours, you could
clear *all* the scout camps, trains and all.  Just buff the mage's pet and
make it MT.  =)

Wow, that's impressive.  I'd've liked to seen that.

Yeah... it's a great feeling to finally see the drop you need after *so*
long a camp.  Despite the wonderful glow, though, it's not an experience I'd
ever care to repeat - "I like to bang my head against the wall because it
feels so good when I stop!".

Happened to us, once, during our long frame camp.  Not on purpose, of
course.  Still, it led to a wipe, and an hour of dragging and rezzing
corpses.

> I sometimes wish I had it in me to be mean like that..

Hehehe... I know that feeling.

We weren't too happy about it either.  =)  We've done HP so many times, it's
easy to become complacent and not quite pay full attention - that's my
theory anyway.  No one - *no one* - was calling out page until after it had
killed a few folks and then spread to the clerics.  How not-paying-attention
do you have to be to not notice you're getting hit and about to die?  =P

Rampage is a mysterious process to me.  We try and set up a tank to be a
Rampage Tank, and still it somehow manages to slip away to other folks
sometimes.  Our guild leader, a bard, is very good at getting and keeping
page; he wasn't there that time, alas.

Honestly don't know.  The SK was all set to run and get my corpse; then when
she saw me at the zone line, she invited me and summoned my corpse.
Because, as she put it, "I hate to drag."

=)  That could be another way of saying, "Man, you're stupid."  In talking
to many folks, I am the only person I know to have actually destroyed my VT
key.  We'll see if this has negative repurcussions later.  I will certainly
agree I've put myself at risk, although I think the risk is small.

> Can they even go that far back in time to check a deleted item?

Hopefully by then I'll have some piece of no-drop VT loot that I can point
to and say, "See?  See?"

Ahhh.  Thanks for the info.  Information about this zone is surprisingly
scarce - many people treat it like top-secret information.  I can sympathize
with the sentiment - "Let 'em figure it out for themselves, just like we
did!"  Still, I've never been above letting people know how to avoid the
pitfalls I fell in to.  As you may have noticed, I like to talk about things
that have happened to me.

Ah.  The folks running the raid may not have known that.

Thanks for the commentary, Martin.  =)
