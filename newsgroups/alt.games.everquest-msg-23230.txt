Point of contention. Hacking is a term originally applied to software
development and alteration. Cracking is getting in where you aren't
wanted. Popular media has blurred the two and applied hacking as the
general term. Altering code in active memory to change the intended
outcome of said program is indeed hacking. Softice is a debugging
tool, and a darned good one. I suspect that is why many l33t hackers
download or trade it. As for getting into someone elses accounts or
Verant's servers, that would be cracking, and a much more difficult
undertaking. Impossible? No, nothing is impossible. Improbable? Very
likely. Other ways? Certainly. People are stupid, social engineering
is always the easiest way.
