This does not match my experience at all, although I do admit that my
experience is mostly limited to pre-elemental things.   With the massive
mudflation being what it is, I suppose its possible it really is different

Of course, only a very small percentage of players is actually playing
there, but that doesn't seem to be a factor in many class balance
discussions.  Heh.
