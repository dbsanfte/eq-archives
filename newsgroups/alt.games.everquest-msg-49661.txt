Yes, but that's exactly what keeps people playing. "Easier" games haven't 
been anywhere near as successful. The pleasure comes from overcoming the 
challenge (even if the challenge consists of sitting on your ass for 
forty-eight hours in a camp from hell). If there is no challenge, there is 
no satisfaction.

Sorry, but you are quite simply talking out of the wrong end of your 
digestive system there. The EQ interface was pretty well thought out to 
start with, and it has been made much more customizable as time went on, so 
you can change almost whatever it is you don't like about it... But I'm 
open to enlightenment. If you can mention a game with similar mechanics and 
a better interface, go ahead. Or at least tell me what you would improve in 
EQ's current interface.

> The class structure and group make-up are too rigid.

Perhaps, but class-based games actually offer more variety than skill 
systems, because in skill systems people tend to gravitate towars "optimal" 
configurations over time. At the end of the day, it turns into a class 
system, only with fewer classes.

So far, so true. EQ has been designed with that goal in mind, and Verant 
have always been upfront about it.

Some do, some don't.

No, nothing to correct, you are entirely right there. Verant is a 
*business*, they aren't your friend or your mother. The relationship 
between Verant and its customers is "You give us your money and we'll keep 
you entertained", and they are holding up their end of the bargain 
magnificently. They use people to entertain people, certainly, but this is 
not enough. If it were, all MMORPGs would be successful, and yet most of 
them are abysmal failures... Funnily enough, those failed games also 
purported to make it easier on the player, either by reducing downtime or 
making soloing more viable.

Moral of the story: Give the gamers what they *really* want, not what they 
*think* they want. Companies who find what the gamers *really* want, and 
deliver it, laugh all the way to the bank.
