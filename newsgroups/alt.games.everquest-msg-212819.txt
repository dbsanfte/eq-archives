I'd normally think the same thing, but the box does not lock up playing 
other DirectX games.

The card is fairly new (I've had it 2 months or so) and is an ASUS Ti4200. 
SmartDoctor (which polls hw temperature, etc on the card) reports no 
problems, and I have not overclocked it. When I got it, I grabbed the most 
recent driver, and I blew out the case when I put the card in (as I do 
whenever I have a case cracked, may as well while I'm in there).
 
I guess I will go see if there are new drivers, and maybe play a day or two 
with a fan blowing on the back of the box to take away the heat faster.

Thanks!
