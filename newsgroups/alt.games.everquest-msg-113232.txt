Yeah, good point. However, I like to keep at least one spell from each
school of magic memmed so that I can keep my skill up whenever
possible. Additionally, my lowest mana spell (naturally the one I
would use for skilling up) using alteration, for example, may not
necessarily be the same as the alteration spell I find useful under
normal circumstances (Fade, for example, is only 10m cost for
alteration practice vs. Gate at 70m). Therefore, I wind up with at
least *two* alteration spells memmed.

That makes five and I would have to fill in the remaining three just
to keep things interesting. I'm not interested in the level grind at
the risk of having fun. :)
