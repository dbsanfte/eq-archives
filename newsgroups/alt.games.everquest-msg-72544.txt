Insane?
I'm surprised it took this long (probably the daily server patches
slowed them down a bit).

As a guess, how long do you think it would take for someone to PL a
character from 1 to 50?  Then from 50 to 60?

Hint:  You can do 1 to 50 in less than 20 hours /played and no, they
aren't "neglecting" any skills.
