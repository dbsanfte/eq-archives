What I wound up doing, strangely, was waiting another hour (still unable
to reach the patcher screen) and deleted the file it downloaded last
time. Restarted the machine and on the next try it logged in just fine.
I still haven't turned on the new UI because I wanted to make sure it
would work at all before I started messing around with that, but it
played ok in the old interface. Sadly, by then, I only had about thirty
minutes to play. I'll try the new UI after work today.

If there's anybody having trouble still, you could give that a try.
Might help. Or it may have just been a bizarre coincidence of timing.
