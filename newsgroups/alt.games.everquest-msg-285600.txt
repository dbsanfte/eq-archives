There's actually a tradeoff here.  I agree that the "quest" in
EverQuest is often awkward.  I've found several where the story
lines are interesting and amusing, the steps are challenging
and fun, etc.  As we all know, of course, often there are steps
that require long camps or hunting for a rare spawn, but that's
part of the different game-style that's been discussed elsewhere
in this thread: sitting in a camp waiting for pops or pulls does
encourage more socialising, which is a difference in style that
is good or bad depending on personal tastes.

However, just FINDING the quests in EverQuest is generally a pain
in the butt.  I've been advancing an alt playing with my wife and
another friend, who mostly play WOW instead.  My wife really
enjoys role-playing and thus finds good story lines a major plus.
I usually find I'm at a complete loss trying to find interesting
quests for us to do, because EQ offers almost no help.  Sure, we
can talk to NPCs and see if they have quests, but there's no way
to know if the quest is something that makes sense for us to do or
whether it's something that'll send our dark elves into Halas and
and eventually yield a Barbarian Shaman-only reward.  In WOW, I'm
told, NPCs are visually marked (and maybe even marked on your map)
*if they have a quest for YOU to do*.  Similarly, many quest items
in WOW drop only if you're doing the quest, ground spawns appear
only to the person doing the quest, etc.

Now, in some sense, that comes back to the same socialising issue.
In EQ, the NPCs (often) talk to anybody, and items (usually) drop
no matter who kills the mob, and ground spawns are always there,
etc.  Which means that *by sharing information with each other*
people solve the quests as a social activity.  But it does mean
that if all you want to do is *do* a quest, it's a lot harder to
figure out what's available and appropriate.

I haven't bought Serpent Spine yet, but from what I've heard it
sounds like SOE deliberately made it more WOW-like in regards to
finding quests.  Could someone who has played both please comment
on whether a WOW player is likely to find the content in TSS more
interesting?  We're currently level 55, if that matters.
