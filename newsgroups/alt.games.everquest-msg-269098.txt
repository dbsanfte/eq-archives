As a single, isolated, instance -- no.

When it becomes endemic - yes. Why? Because then Sony has to rebalance
encounters around the fact everyone will be twinked -- which places
the non-twinked at a disadvantage. It also shifts design resources to
adding more uber-content, undermining the "newbie" experience.

In short, it changes the tenor of the world, and, IMO, for the worse. 

As a good example, look at SWG. Sony grossly underpowered things like
Krayts, so everyone was soloing them and maxing out their skills. Then
they tried to "solve" this by kicking their HAM bars up tenfold, which
led to people who had come to expect to be able to solo dying. So then
they upped the way buffs worked, so everyone had to get super-buffed
by doctors before going out, and prices for said buffs went through
the roof, but the only content worth going after required them, so..

I left SWG about six months ago, and, from what I can tell, it's STILL
a mess. They've thrown in the towel and made it "Jedi online".

Games live or die on their balance. A lot of gamers don't see that --
all they see is "NERF!". They do not realize that without limits, the
game becomes meaningless.
