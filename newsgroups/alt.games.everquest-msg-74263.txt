Same, its dark as hell. For the first time I notice a difference
between my infra and ultravision characters (god I'd hate to be human)
My gamma slider works, but by default it seems to be so much darker
even with it all the way up. Even the ultravision character can't see
that well though now.

In fact I also had my nvidia brightness and gamma up, with the gamma
up to 2.60 before luclin. Now It really needs to be even higher. When
I'm in Luclin I can especially forget about seeing that well on the
dark side.. I mean ITS DARK.

So, if you have any kind of desktop vid driver settings you can raise
brightness and gamma also there. With nvidia drivers you go to
advanced (when have display properties open by right clicking on
desktop) then to color correction. After adjusting the brightness and
gamma sliders you hit the checkbox to save the settings then hit
apply.

I did hear about some people who's in game gamma slilder stopped
working altogether. I forget if it was ever solved but your best bet
is to go to the official eq message boards and look under the tech
section maybe doing a search for "gamma."
