Congratulations! Major EQ accomplishment, well done.

I was in the serverwide.enchanter channel when your guild won and some of
your enchanters were linking loot and bragging about the first-attempt kill.
One of them mentioned Silent Tempest, and I said "Hey, isn't that Monual's
guild?'.  They laughed, and I was happy for ya.    Thanks for all the great
posts detailing your moves through PoP.  They've been a lot of fun to read
as my own guild covers some of the same ground.

Again, congratulations!
