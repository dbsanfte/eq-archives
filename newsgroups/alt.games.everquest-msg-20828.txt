OK, if this ever happens again theres a couple of things you should
know:

You can catch old world boats you've just missed by swimming through the
front of the hull (if you can catch them - say you're sowed and levved
or something).

the Maiden Voyage has a little sloped bit going down into the water at
one end (prow I think). You can climb onto that from the water, so you
don't need to use a shuttle to board it in order to get high enough to
use the ramp up to the deck, you just sit on the prow for the trip. What
my druid does if ever getting that boat is cast lev on BB dock, zone in
on the shuttle, run under lev to the Maiden Voyage and sit on the prow.
If lev starts to drop, I can run off the prow, recast it, and run back
under SoW, without losing the boat. That way when it zones in to Firiona
Vie I can just run off it towards the dock rather than waiting for
shuttles etc. When you get to the dock this way, you'll be at sea level,
underneath the dock - you need to find a ladder running up to an entry
hatch in the dock (or swim round the whole of the dock outpost to the
shore).

If you ever fall off a boat in TD, it may be just as quick to swim to
the Firepot room as to swim to a dock. Once in the firepot room you can
TP to Cabilis or most old world cities easily, so the extra time
swimming there vs. using the boat will probably be compensated for by
speed of getting to your destination. If you can invis for example, its
probably just as quick to zone into FV, go to the firepots, port to
Cabilis under invis and zone out into Lake of Ill Omen as it would be to
take the boat from Butcherblock to Firiona Vie and run through the
entire zone to Lake of Ill Omen, dodging invis-seeing Drachnids all the
way.
