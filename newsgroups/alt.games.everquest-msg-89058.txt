I checked it out last night after reading this thread. I was low on
drink (again) when I logged out, so I logged in and just immediately
started pulling skellies and bandits. (DING 10!by the way.<g> Only fifty
more to go.)

Anyway, I ran out of drink in short order and soon got the "You are out
of drink. You are thirsty." messages. Sure enough, next forage resulted
in a water. Not conclusive, I know, since it could have happened on any
given forage. But thus far I've seen nothing to contradict that theory.
