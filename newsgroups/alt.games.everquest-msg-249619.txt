So, I stumbled into a new zone last night.  It is an instanced
'encounter' zone (alt-z by default).   Interesting place, you can
bring 1 to 6 people into it and you can invite people in even after
you've been in.

Called Forgotten Halls if I remember correctly.  Go to Nedaria's
Landing and wander down to the southern dock and talk to an elf named
Eldros Dannor.  Go through his prompts and he'll hook you up.  Then
run over to the North and find the bear caves.  The first room has a
Taelosian (pardon my spelling!).  Hail her, follow the prompts and
you're in!

I don't know much more than that except to say that the Granite
Protector's are VERY social... *ouch*.   I tried one pull (solo as a
beastlord) and got pasted pretty quickly  ;-)   Cool zone, I'm
guessing they're trying out some new DX9 stuff - the water looked
rather reflective.

Some say it is just a show case, but others are grinding there.  I'm
curious if anyone has any other information to share?
