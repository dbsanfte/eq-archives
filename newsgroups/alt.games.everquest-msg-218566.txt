Personally, I'd rather see "pls". It's an actual abbreviation for the
word, meaning that it doesn't contain any letters that aren't in the
full word. IMO, "pls" is tolerable. "plz" isn't.

Then again, myself, I may be choppy with words when in a hurry, but I
don't ever resort to "d00d" abbreviations. "Move please" doesn't take
any noticeable amount of time more than "move plz". Hell, the
shorthand actually slows me down, as it doesn't "flow" naturally.
