[snip list]

that's a great start, and i thank you

however, at first it seemed to have lots of PoP mobs, which i'm quiet
ignorant of...then on second and third glance, it seemed to only have a few

is most of PoP excluded from this list because the progression is kind of
obvious (since PoP came about broken into tiers, by design) ?

thanks
