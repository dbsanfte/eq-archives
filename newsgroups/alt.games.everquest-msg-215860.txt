Drelzna caused a wipe recently for my mid-30s duo last time I engaged 
her... chain Harm Touched... 6 times in a row...we melted. I don't know 
if its a bug or not...

we re-engaged, and basically nuke-mez... wait, nuke-mez, wait (heal from 
the HT she got off)... nuke-mez... and even so she got off two HTs over 
the fight.

I don't know if she's supposed to be like that, or whether it was a bug. 
But it was ridiculous.
