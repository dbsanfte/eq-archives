Alright i've been playing Everquest for awhile and have found so slow ways
to make money now most people i've read think killing monsters and selling
the loot is the only way to make money, but i've seen many and i mean many
ways to get money from a lvl 4 with invis, but they seem to want 10-100$ for
them. Everquest is just a game to me not my life goal to be the best, but i
like the realness of the game, althought spell graphics could be better:)
but for the most part it was a well thought out game. Now i'm not saying i
don't want to be good and have uber gear:) So i was wondering if you check
out www.eqguide.com or something like that they say they have the best blah
blah blah and you can pay by mail or by credit card and he/they will give
you the url/password for the site to get the downloads from, if someone
could give me the url and password it would be nice but i'm not paying, i
know i'm cheap but like i said its just a game to me. I don't want to make
this to long and have no relpies so i'm going to finish this up, i figure no
one would have the url/password or let alone want to share it if they paid
it already and i wouldn't blame them its their money.

Also if someone would have a good guide for money with a low level and invis
or a 23rd cleric/36th wizard could do i would also be thankful for.

And not the stupid one with baking fish fillets or whatever and the smoked
shark meat rip off one:) (which i hear isn't doable anymore) 120pp/hr
doesn't seem fast enough for me when people are saying they can do 500pp/hr
with a lvl 4 invis:)

Thanks
