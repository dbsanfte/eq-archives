Wolf form is KOS in all of kunark, and in velious (caveat to follow) as
well as in Everfrost in old world zones.

What wolf form does essentially is return you to base faction, removing
racial modifiers, and then apply religious, and or actions (faction
Pluses and minuses based on kills/quests).

In Velious through faction work, you can raise your faction enough (and
easily with the coldain at least) to become non kos in wolf form.  I
don't know if this can be done in Kunark or not, I would say no, as it
has not been widely mentioned like the velious zones and ability to rise
above kos while in wolf form.  It may just be that there are too many
factions in Kunark to practically become non-kos.  Essentially in Kunark
to become no kos you would have to raise your faction with all of the
guilds there, as well as with the different citizen groups, such as the
pilgrims etc.  I don't know if this can be done, but certainly not
without a huge amount of tedium, to the point of being called
impossible.
