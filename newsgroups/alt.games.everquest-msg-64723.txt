For the record, in our Gateway machine, up until last week I had 128 MB
SDRAM installed in three slots, in the form of a single 64 MB stick and
two 32 MB sticks. The 32's were from a different manufacturer, etc. from
the 64 and it worked fine. Not saying that would work for *all* systems,
but it worked for mine so the phrase "You can't have a 128MB DIMM and a
256MB DIMM on the same board." is, if not total horsehsit, at least not
true in all cases.

Second scenario. My IBM specs came with dire warning that I *had* to
have two evenly matched RDRAM chips to go into the two available RIMM
slots in my motherboard. They are only sold in pairs. So I'd either have
to get two 128's to make 256, or a pair of 256's to get 512. The machine
came with 128 MB total, so I'd assumed it was a pair of 64's. Guess
what? BZZZT! Wrong. It had a single 128 MB RDRAM in one slot and a dummy
placeholder in the other. 
YMMV, but be cautious just the same.
