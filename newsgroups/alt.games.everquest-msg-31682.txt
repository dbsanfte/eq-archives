Obviously not, seeing as how you missed mine...

Why would I do either? In shouting "camp check", he's not camping
anything...

Second...Someone being at a camp does not prohibit me from taking
spawns. Courtesy would tell me I should ask first or leave it alone,
but he is in no way stopping me from taking the spawns (unless he
starts KSing them from me after I pull them, in which case, he would
be doing something reportable). The rule doesn't ban him from camping
the spawn. It bans him from being able to stop me from taking the
spawn before he does even if he's been there longer.
