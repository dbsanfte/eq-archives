That's pretty damned stupid. How would the other characters in the guild
even know that there *are* players, much less require that all characters
who share the same player be members of the same guild? That's ludicrous.
Characters do not know that they are characters: it's impossible for them to
make rules based on who has whom as a player. That's stupidity on parade.
