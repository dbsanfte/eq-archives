It was their main name, for some.

Tolkien says that halflings are the name that men
used for hobbits.

Whereabouts in the book is this?

As I remember the reason they were called
halflings because they were half men, or half the
size of men.

No. Tolkien doesn't say anywhere that I can
remember that they are 'like' halflings. He says
in quite a few places that they 'are' halflings,
or rather that that is how races, other than
Hobbits, refer to them.

I think that the word "halfling", and therefore
definition, was coined by Tolkien, although I
accept the possibility I may be wrong about that.

I also think that it would be fair to say, that if
the Tolkien estate hadn't sued TSR in the early
days of D&D, then the halflings in EQ would now be
called Hobbits.
