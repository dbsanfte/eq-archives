Did this with my 39 Druid, and found to my surprise that Drones of Doom,
Creeping Crud, and Stinging Swarm all stack. I figured that Drones, and
Creeping might stack since they have different spell icons, but I was mildly
surprised to find out that Stinging Swarm stacks with Drones of Doom since
they have the same icon.
