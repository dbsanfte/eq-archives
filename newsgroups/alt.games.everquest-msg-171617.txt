Yet, a little effort on their part would have shown that it has
already been said a thousand times. Therefore, it becomes little more
than a whine.

I am ever amazed by people who join an existing group and take offense
when people voice a mild (and it was mild) criticism of their
regurgitation of topics which have already already beaten to death by
the rest of the group. It is as if they assume that no conversational
topic of any value could have been covered already since they were not
there to start it. How hard would it have been to read up on
everything this group had already said on the subject? What more did
the OP hope to accomplish? It amounted to just another post with no
redeeming value that I have to wade through to get to anything
interesting or useful.

Besides, I can't begin to take anyone with a moniker like "Uber Nukah"
very seriously, but that's a personal opinion.

P.S Kaev = noob?  Puhlease. Back on your trike, UN. Sticks and stones
and all that, I'm sure.
