Actually, all the non-named sentries and sentiels can load bracers,
arms, boots, gloves and helm.

Only the named watchers load the legs and BP.

The most common loads are boots and gloves.  The rarest loads are legs
and bp.

If you don't give a shit about Thurg faction and have a few people of
similar mind, a warrior + rogue + cleric combo in Icewell punting
dorfs can make some very good exp.  Just remember, there's no crowd
control in Icewell with dorfs except tank-mez.

Even if you do care about Thurg faction, repairing Coldain faction is
pretty easy.  Repairing Dain faction however can be a real pain.
