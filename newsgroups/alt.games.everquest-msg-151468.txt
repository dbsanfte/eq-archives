Im a level 35 wizard and am starting to get a bit bored of playing a 
wizard.
I find no one wants to group with wizards, anyone know why this is?
I have soloed most of the way to level 35 and get people saying no one 
wants wizards just do quad kiting.
Whilst i can do that its nice to be able to group too occasionally for 
the social interaction.
I think im finding them a bit too one dimensional
I started a druid recently and that seems good fun.
I can melee a bit as well as cast and kite etc.
Anyone else find playing a wizard boring to play?
