I know this groups thoughts on ebay and I share them for the most part (I
have known a couple exceptions) I want an epic mage.... badly but I know
with my work schedule even when I get my mage to 60 there is no way in hell
I will be able to get mine. I've read the walkthroughs on it and have
neither the guild power nor have any desire to be in a full raiding guild.
I'm happy soloing and most of my characters have the ability to solo or at
least partner with another of my accounts. I have seen a couple mage
accounts with epics for sale and with the mage epic being a spell I assume
that I can transfer servers with it minus all the gear that previous owner
had. I have a full set of int gear to put my int at 200+ I was wondering if
either someone had bought an epic mage and had transferred servers, or if
anyone had transferred servers and could offer some advice on the best way
to go about doing it
