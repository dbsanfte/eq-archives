   Indeed, he his.  One of our guildees, a halfing, gave us a port to the commons. 
Of course, I knew that this would involve popping into a druid ring, but for some
dumb reason I didn't connect the dots.  Lenny, in real life, emitted a high-pitched
squeal when he saw where he was, and, in-game, ran like a scared little rabbit.  He
made it somehow without drawing aggro, but he was hyperventilating when he finally
stopped.  I don't know exactly what happened to him in which incarnation that made
him terror prone, but I'm guessing that whatever it was, he will never get over the
trauma.  I just /smiled and told our druid friend that next time, Lenny would
_really_ appreciate a camo first.
