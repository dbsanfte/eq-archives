Last night in WC, my Beastlord sits medding after a nasty battle in
Befallen.

Then this character runs up to me and starts with the universal
greeting:

Cluelezz_: "SoW plz."
Me : "Im sorry im a Beastlord. Ill get SoW when i reach lvl 30. ))"

..it so continues...

Cluelezz_: "Buff plz"

So I med a bit, and then casts Strenght and Inner Fire on him. 

While I sit back to finish my med, 'Cluelezz_' starts to cast a spell.
Imagine my baffelment when the 'Cluelezz_ is surrounded by a lupine
aura' message appears !!. I did a /who Cluelezz_, and sure enough: hes
a Druid !

I then comment on the fact that he requests buffs from others, that
hes quite capable of casting himself ... but no answer.

...one word sprung to mind 'eBay'

Well you'll sure get to meet some interesting people arround Norrath
:o)
