This is more of a PvP question I guess. Bunch of our guild went and duked it
out in the arena last night for fun. I'm a 31 Nec...lot of them in their
50's but some were pretty close to my lvl.

I obviously need a better tactic and spell lineup more in tune with PvP next
time because I promptly got my ass beat 5 out of 5 times...any suggestions?
