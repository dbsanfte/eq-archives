When we run people like Bush and Reagan, we run people with a good amount of
common sense, and above average "intellect."  Sure, Clinton and Carter may
have had a higher IQ, but without common sense, it didn't get either of them
too far.  Your "intellectuals" tend not to make a good showing for
themselves in the real world.  Maybe if they came down from their Ivory
towers... well then it would only be a matter of time before they were
republicans.

Just out of curiosity, what's your take on Zell Miller?

Really?  We'll set aside the fact that there is strong evidence pointing to
the same ol' election fraud on Gore's side, and I'll give you one
interesting point that few people are aware.

In that entire total for Bush, my vote is not counted.  I voted absentee in
Arizona.  In that state, Bush won by a margin that was larger than the total
number of absentee ballots, so even with them all going for Gore, Bush would
still win.  By law, Arizona was not required to count those ballots; to save
money, they didn't.  Now, who votes absentee... mostly military.  So, how
much of the military didn't get counted?  Was it enough to put Bush over the
top?  Who knows, because we were disenfrancised, we weren't tallied.  Thats
aside from the intentional effort to not count the military vote in Florida,
lead by Gore's attack team.

IOW, Gore neither won the popular vote, nor the electorate.  It's an out and
out LIE.
