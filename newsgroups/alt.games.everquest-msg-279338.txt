I believe you missed the point:   "You are anon and WANT a rez?"
The anon player isn't the cleric...

I made a habit of doing /who and being 'busy' if the requester
was anon (if I didn't know them, of course.)  Back then
that was mostly druids/wizards, however, using anon to avoid
/tell themselves.  A bit of the 'what's good for the goose' IMO.

What always amazed me was the druids (usually) going anon
AND moving from zone to zone hawking ports.   Huh?
