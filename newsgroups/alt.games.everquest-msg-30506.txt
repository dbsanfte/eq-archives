I realize it was a lengthy post, but if you'll go back and read it again, I
*did* answer your question. You just didn't like the answer.  You're looking for
a number, and you keep throwing out examples of numbers. My answer is that it
has to remain a case by case basis.  Each case needs to be examined on its own
merits, and each little criminal has to be judged by their actions. There are
obviously some mostly well behaved fourteen year olds out in farm country who
might be out hunting squirrels with their cousin and accidentally shoot him with
their .410 shotgun.  Should they get the death penalty or heavy time? Most
likely not. Then there's going to be 14 year olds who've already been in a gang
since they were eleven, and the only way they are going to get their colors and
be a full member of the Cryps is to go wax a Korean. So they do. I'm sure even a
bleeding heart liberal like yourself will see the difference between these two
scenarios, and the need for different standards of punishment, regardless of
thier age.
