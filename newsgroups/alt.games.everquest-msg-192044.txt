I agree with both of the above plus, the shrooms and Lightcrawlers have a
massive aggro range and the person training prolly never even knew he had
picked them up...the Rockhopper was likely the same situation as most will
run to NL and not ME for safety, why? Because ME is train central and you do
NOT want to run into a train on the other side of that zone line, as you
found out.
Change your hunting point, zone lines might seem like safe places due to an
easy escape route but as you are beginning to see (I hope) they are not. I
am always amazed that people pull to ME zone, I imagine they only do it
until they zone into a train on the other side, then they think better of
the idea, trains in ME to zone can stay there for ages as more ppl leave the
zone and pull the mobs back again.
