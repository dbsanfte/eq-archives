My original warrior EXPd here for several levels without an Evac, so 
knowing the way out was high on our list =)

How do you break the temple without aggroing the pits?  My normal group can 
just pull the whole temple at once and tear them up, but I'm going to be 
leading a group of 30-40s in here this week and knowing how to pull the 
temple the "right" way will be a big help.
