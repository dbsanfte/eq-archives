Below L20 the mobs have so few HP that the only thing I care about
in weapons is speed and dex.  Glowing Black Sword, for example is
a cheap way to get your 1hs up (9/22 +20dex), Jagged Blade of
Mourning is OK, Defiance is probably best that's not too expensive.
For 2-handers, Nathsar Greatsword is very cheap and faster than
the ACGS (which is decent damage output, but slower for skill-ups)
and has good enough damage output to be ok into your mid-30s at
least.  The Centi Warspear (or whatever it's called) is a very
cheap 2HP option that's good for training (20/30), I haven't seen
a cheap fast 2hb that's Paladin usable and has OK damage output,
but you can get your skill-ups with someting like a Runed Bokken
(7/30).

Clay Guardian is cheap, but Sarnak Battle Shield is much better
and very inexpensive for its stats (it's common and there are
lots of better shields out there nowadays in the hands of higher
level players).

Get his STA over 100 immediately, get him at least one decent
weight reduction bag (Bag of Sewn Evil Eyes of better) to hold
his spare weapons.  Through level 10 it's essentially impossible
to keep your weapon skills up, you can make some progress through
your teens, by mid 20s he should be able to cap all of his skills
(weapons) if he wants to.  Given how much better armor is today
than in the past, it's very easy to give him an AC that's past
the effective "softcap" for the mobs he's fighting even while
wearing "trash" gear like the Executioner's Hood and the Golden
Black Pearl Necklace to boost DEX for weapon skill-ups.  Make
sure he casts his heals (and roots 22+) and buffs often enough
to keep those casting skills up, it's pretty pathetic to run
into a L40 Paladin who's casting L9 and L15 buffs because the
others always fizzle (yes, I've seen this more than once).
