If you get the dress i think it has to pass some 15 - 20 mins
before he will have it again, but it seems to be a bit random,
so it may take longer than that.

Have no idea, have only killed scrawny gnolls and gnolls, don't

My human monk in qeynos has just gained lvl 5 and roundkick,
if i understand you qestion correctly you will need to hit the hot key

Only lvl 5 so that i leave to others to answer.

By the the way qeynos sewers are a nice place to level up in,
took my monk down there at late lvl 2 and fought until lvl 5,
15% bonus on xp makes a difference :)
