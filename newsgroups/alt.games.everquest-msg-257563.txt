I hate, abhor, despise dying to anything aside from poor judgment on my
part.  I dislike dying to poor judgment on my part, but I try not to let
that happen often.

As a monk whose deaths are usually preceded by one or more "Faned has fallen
to the ground" messages, my opinion on this is unshakeable.  =)

Two ahead, one to the right, one to the left.  Maybe one wanderer.

I just described the mob distribution at every 3-way with a a dead-end
intersection in every LDoN dungeon.

Yes, you eventually learn the mob layout in Lower Guk.  But when you do, you
have more acquired knowledge than after you learn the layout of *every* LDoN
dungeon.

I have done just enough LDoNs that I still occasionally walk into one I've
not been in before.  The "newness" doesn't slow me down in the slightest,
because there's nothing new about it.  There is no need to be careful and
explore options.  When I get to the 3-way intersection with a dead-end,
there will be two ahead, one to the right, one to the left, and maybe one
wanderer.
