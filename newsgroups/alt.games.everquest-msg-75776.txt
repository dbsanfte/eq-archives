This is kinda off topic in this thread but I thought I would mention
it anyway.

Since someone earlier mention the "driveby SOW", and the responding
niceites from the bufee.....

I was helping a guildie clear Fire Giant's in SolB the other day and
decided it was time to leave, so I do the normal SolB thing and
announce a train from Naggies Lair to Zone out to warn everyone off.

I stop along the way to nail a bat that aggros, kill it, and get the
usual train of Kobalds etc and make my way to the zone.

I zone out at about 1.5 bubs of health and resign myself to a long
wait before I log to heal up.... It takes a LONG time for a fully
buffer 59 Warrior to regen full health btw.

Next thing I see is....

Random_Cleric says Erk, bad train ehh?
Sikk says hehe, just my normal exit train :)
Random_Cleric says LOL np I'll pop a heal on ya
Sikk says aww thanks man, appreciated!
Random_Cleric begins to cast a spell

Sikk says :) that'll teach you to heal everyone LOL

I do a /who Random_Cleric revealing a 38 Cleric. He's no OOM I am
guessing, and knowing how bad mana regen can be (45ish cle also) I
prompty give him 100pp.

Random Cleric says WOW, OMG thanks!
Sikk says np, Thanks for the heals again

Made my night.

Goes to show, you never know what you might get for being nice :)
