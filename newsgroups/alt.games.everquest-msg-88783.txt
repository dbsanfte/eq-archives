I think I Quadded Drolvargs in the NW corner of FV for a while. No one hangs
out there and it's near a zone and has safe medding spots.

Then I moved on to the Walrii in the SW corner of EW. Again, no one there
and safe medding spots.

The key to quadding is to pick an isolated area so you don't bother other
players.
