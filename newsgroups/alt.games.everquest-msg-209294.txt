As I mentioned in another thread, I made half of 63 at the 'stakers camp 
in PoN in one afternoon, using Call of Karana. Definitely, the charm 
nerf was a kick in the arse, but it's still the fastest way to make xp 
outside of a group... And unfortunately, I don't find groups in the Tier 
2 and Tier 3 planes as often as I'd like.
