Try and see if you can avoid the temptation of turning on your cable modem
for a few hours before getting the router, to avoid the problems you ran
into.

If you can't help yourself I know that the Linksys router will let you set
its MAC address (the router has one too) to whatever you'd like...set it the
same as whatever NIC you were last using that worked.

To get the MAC in Win9x (don't know about ME) do Start >> Run >> WINIPCFG.
Make sure you scroll down to your NIC (it usually defaults to PPP which
would be your phone line modem if you had one...I don't and it STILL goes
there first :p ) and the "Adapter Address" is the MAC.

In Win2k and probably XP do Start >> Run >> IPCONFIG.  If you get a black
box that flashes and disappears, do
Start >> Run >> CMD
At the DOS prompt type: IPCONFIG and hit enter.  The MAC should be listed
there.
