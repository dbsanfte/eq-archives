There's too much chatter in EQ to provide for immersion ... for me, anyway.
It's rather like trying to become immersed at a party.  I enjoy going to
parties, but I don't look for an immersive experience there.

Our personal situations are most likely different, as well.  For me at
least, immersion is as much about the environment as it is about the subject
matter.  As a 40 year old man with a wife and two young kids who, more often
than not, need something from me while I'm playing, the environment here
really isn't that conducive to immersion.

Get me to Borders with a book, and I can become immersed rapidly.  Yes,
there are more people there, but none of them needs a thing from me.  The
library would be even better, but our local library keeps frustratingly odd
hours.
