Yes, for we all know that /ooc babble is the ultimate arbiter of fine logic
and good common sense.

Don't level up past 30 then. Solo pvp becomes less and less viable the
higher level you get.

You go on believing that.
And I fully expect a post from you in about 6 months, along the line of
"It's not fair. My group got killed by two other groups and I had to LnS
from the zone for a whole hour! Why can't they fight fair and wait for us to
med back to full and only attack when the numbers are even?"

Seriously, if you want an environment where it's all about one-on-one pvp
where both participants are ready and so on, such an environment does exist.
It's called "Duelling on the non-pvp servers". That's about as close as
you'll get to what you seem to desire.
