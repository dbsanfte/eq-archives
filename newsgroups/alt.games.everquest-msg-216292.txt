Oh yeah, I can see it now: 350 pounds of tinned meat [*] trying to stop
a ton or more [**] of raging, flight capable, highly intelligent,
magical beast.  Yep.  Definite no-brainer there.

[*] I know it's way overweight from a historical perspective, but we've

[**] I don't know about your dragons, but mine outmass the horses and
cattle they so enjoy dining on.
