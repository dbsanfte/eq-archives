hey, what about gnomes? i wanted to hear those thoughts =)

and about the races / classes being locked to start with - don't forget that 
they're linked to the expansions they came with as a matter of 
fundamentals - it really does make sense, no? if you've ever played an 
account without an expansion enabled, you grok how that relationship works 
... i guess you were always lucky? hell, i remember not having $30 to buy 
velious =)

but of course, on the other hand, i am insatiably curious to see what 
berserkers would look like if they didn't have the headstart of all those 
tune-ups the combat system has received ... would they really be so high in 
dps? is their dps mostly itemization (i don't think so, i'm just 
spouting...)?

either way, it's going to be great ^_^
