Yeah I agree. I think this is just another step towards Everquest's
migrating
everyone to EQ2. I mean once they make a portal to every zone what is
really left after that? Of course they will still make expansions for EQ and
keep the gamers happy who spent all of 3 months doing the "Race to 60".

I think half of the problem with the old journeys is that nothing happened
during the boat rides. What they needed to incorporate was maybe some
pirates (as in an opposing ship) and sea monsters. I'm sure you'd see some
guild raids forming on a trip thru TD to battle a giant sea wurm! There
could
have been alternatives to the trips, but they just canned it and moved on.

Hell, I'd love to be a pirate.
