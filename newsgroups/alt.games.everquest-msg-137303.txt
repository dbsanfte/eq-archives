This knee jerk reaction  to a cleric being beaten on is an incorrect one
in most situations.  Cleric has more HP and AC than 3/4ths the classes
out there, by your level has plenty of channeling skill, and not one
but TWO spells which let him drop aggro down to the bottom of the
hate list while going invulnerable to all damage save for DT for
18 seconds.

The only time when you need to "get it off the cleric QUICK" is
when a wipe is inevitable and the cleric is trying to camp/quit
out so he can return to rez you all.
