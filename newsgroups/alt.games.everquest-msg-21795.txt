with my first question dogging people..but i didnt..i came across nice..i
didnt deserve his remark..rather if  it was light or not..give me respect
and ill do the same..f*** with me and ill F*** with you.no reason to be
carefull ,tell your friends to becarefull when talking  to someone.dont jump
on the band wagon when you see something too..know me before you cast me in
hell ..im not new and i play fair and i will treat you fair if you do the
same..but dont play the dumb games..so hootie ,etc,whoever is on the band
