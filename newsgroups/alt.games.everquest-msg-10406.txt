My 85th level cleric's name, Graham, is taken from
a well-known US
televangelist. Some of the macro's he has....

/say In the name of Rodcet Nife, be HEALED!
/cast 8 (best healing spell. Similar macro used
for various cures.)

/say May the Healer keep you safe.
/cast 7 (holy armor)

/em calls down divine wrath upon %t!
/cast 1 (best direct damage and vs. Undead spells)

/cast 4 (gate)
/say Rodcet Nife, take me home!

/mourn say says, 'O ye of little faith.' (for when
a targeted spell like
heal fizzles.)

I use social macros A LOT with my characters, both
for spells (those that
get magic) and other things like taunt (/em
insults %t's mother.) and
roleplaying (/kneel say makes a polite curtsey
before %t.)
