I think they've exacerbated a pre-existing problem.  This will, with
any luck, allow them to identify and correct it.  Pre-patch I would
occasionally lock-up, forgetting to rebbot after using Netscrape,
zoning in and out of bazaar multiple times,  switching chars multiple
times, or just leaving my trader up in bazaar for hours on end would
make lock-ups much more likely.  Now lock-ups occur sooner, but they
still seem to be influenced by the same actions.  I do hope they can
identify and correct the root cause(s), rather than patching around
symptoms and thus rendering the game far more unstable (and likely
making the next substantial patch a true nightmare).
