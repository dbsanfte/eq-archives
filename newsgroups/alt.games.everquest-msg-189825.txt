LOL - I was a newbie bard and I started in Kelethin :)
NOW YOU TELL ME!!!
T.
---------------------------

Don't play in Kelethin the awkwardness of the platforms is enough to put off

Ones I would stay well clear of are :

Bard - RSI - need I say more, its horribly complex to explain, it
difficult to play.
