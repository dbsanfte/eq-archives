That has got to be the dumbest reason to go looking for hardware i have seen
yet..

A) like posted elswhere use both company names versus on brand one company
B) use market share and try to drill down to percentage problem users.
with the numbers you posted if there are 10000000000 nvidia users running
everquest and 500 radeon users on everquest I would come to a completely
different conclusion than you did.

besides the dx9 driver software issue is not really  going to be fixed with
dx9hardware.
the 2 are completely differerent. I have my doubts there are even any dx9
hardware functions implemented in everquest.
my gf2 and ti4200 have no problems running directx 9b and everquest. the
ti4200 is faster nicer of course and I believe even has the needed pixel
shader and vertex shader for everquest 2. So far the new dx9 apps are
falling short of expectations and my guess would be the next gen of cards
and directx9cde or whatever will improve greatly.
