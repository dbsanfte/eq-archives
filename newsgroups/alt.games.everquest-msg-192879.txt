For gear upgrades:

First, get a Lockjaw Hide Vest. It'll make your buffs last a bit longer, and
the Sta boost comes in handy. If you can't find one for 40pp or less in the
Bazaar, wait. Anything over that is robbery. Look into getting Split Paw
Hide Gloves, too. They should cost under 15pp. (All the Split Paw Hide armor
is reasonably cheap, but also look up Gnome Skin - Gnome Skin is black, btw,
so you'll look like a Rogue if you get a full set)

Second, even though the Druid epic is a 1hs weapon, stick with 1hb for now.
There are a lot of nice 1hb weapons you'll be able to use. Like a Velium
Etched Stone Mace, which has a good Wis bonus, for instance. When you start
making a decent amount of plat, buy a 1hs weapon and use it in groups to
train up your skill but stick with the 1hb for soloing. A Velium Scimitar
should be reasonably cheap, but if you see a Coldain Velium Scimitar that
costs more, buy it instead. (Coldain Velium weapons proc at lvl 1. Regular
Velium weapons don't proc until lvl 25, and you'll be able to afford a lot
better before you hit lvl 25) Instead of the Velium Scimitar, consider
getting a Firebrand Scimitar if you see one for sale. Firebrand Scimitars
(player-made, btw) not only look awesome, but they are a better choice over
the non-Coldain Velium Scimitar because of the extra fire dmg that doesn't
require a proc to happen. (My Druid alt carries a Firebrand Scimitar for
training up 1hs)
