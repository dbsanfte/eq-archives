Sorry, that wasn't as clear as it should have been

Time 00:0 : Tick - press 1
Time 00.3 : Song 1 begin cast
Time 03.3 : song 1 starts (1 has 3 ticks left - 1:3 for notation)
Time 03.6 : song 2 begin cast
Time 06.0 : Tick (1:2)
    	Song one does it's damage or healing
Time 06.6 : song 2 starts (1:2,2:3)
Time 06.9 : song 3 begin cast
Time 09.9 : song 3 starts (1:2,2:3,3:3)
Time 10.2 : song 4 begin cast
Time 12.0 : Tick (1:1,2:2,3:2)
    	Song 1,2,3 do their damage or healing
Time 13.2 : song 4 starts (1:1,2:2,3:2,4:3)
Time 13.5 : song 5 begin cast
Time 16.5 : song 5 starts (1:1,2:2,3:2,4:3,5:3)
Time 16.8 : song 1 begin cast
Time 18.0 : Tick (1 ends, 2:1,3:1,4:2,5:2)
    	Song 1,2,3,4,5 all do their damage or healing
    	after song 1 does its effect, it's over.
    	but, as long as it's back up by sec 24, you
    	don't lose anything.

The tick is independent of when you cast the spell/
song.  So, the initial damage of a bard dot doesn't
happen when the song first pulses, it happens on the
first tick AFTER that pulse.

I demonstrated this to myself in an odd way - I created
a kitty bard, then used my mage to put a 33pt damage
shield on him.  This is a bit ago.  Remember, you need
to do at least one point of damage to a mob - if all the
damage is from the DS, they poof.  I'd sing CoD and the
mobs would still poof, even though they'd lit up from the
song.  That's because they hit the DS before the next
tick caused damage.
