We do not support the use of firewalls or proxies, including home
cablemodem/dsl NAT routers and other Internet Connection Sharing devices or
software. However, the following information might be helpful if you need to
troubleshoot a connection that utilizes one of those technologies:
Patch Application:
A TCP connection is initiated from the player's PC (using an arbitrary
port>=1024) to patch.everquest.com, port 7000. There are multiple IP
addresses for the patch.everquest.com clusters, and they may change as the
network demands, so check often using a DNS lookup tool if you provide a
specific firewall rule for patching.

EverQuest client:
UDP datagrams are sent to/from the player's PC (using an arbitrary
port>=1024) from/to one of the EverQuest servers (using an arbitrary
port>=1024).

The EverQuest server IP addresses are on the subnets:
64.37.148.* , 64.37.149.* , 64.37.150.* , 64.37.151.* , 63.241.40.*,
63.241.41.*, 63.241.42.*, 63.241.43.*, 64.37.156.* , 64.37.157.* , and
195.33.108.*


Please note that EverQuest opens a random UDP data port from the player's PC
every time EverQuest is run. Thus, the need to have all ports >= 1024
available.
