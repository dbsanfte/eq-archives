I work for a market research company and we are doing a research
project about the state of the gaming industry.  I am trying to get
some background information about gaming and in particular online
gaming.  What I am trying to find out is, what makes a good online
RPG?  I have some ideas from a console video game stand point but what
to know how that may or does differ for online gamesï¿½Any help/info
would be greatly appreciated
