You are complaining to the wrong forum.

The leading elements here agree that you had to have given your password out as
there is no way it could have been hacked.  Most people here will probably tell
you that you are lying about not giving out your password.

This happened to a buddy of mine in the spring, VI did nothing about it then
either.  He hadn't given his password out and the GMs kept refusing to answer
his emails.  Calling VI lead to a chick who told him she couldn't help him and
no one else would talk to him.  He doesn't play any more and cancelled his
account.

VI customer service is shit.  The only things that keep me in EQ are the
friends who won't, as yet, move on to a new game.

UO CS was shit too, but at least they weren't out to get you.
