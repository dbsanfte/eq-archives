I don't think theres anything nice about this server, and I don't see
how anyone could possibly think its fun. Not only is it old world (and
LoY) only and only up to L50 but go ld in a fight, welcome to L1. Try
to med anywhere but safely near guards, and someone comes along...
welcome to L1.

And apparently the server will be reset halfway through january
anyways.

Maybe if the exp was 2000% normal it would be worth the time
investment... but not as it is right now. Masochists only.
