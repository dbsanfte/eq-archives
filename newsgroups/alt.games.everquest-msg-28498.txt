Ok here's my situation. After running around in Antonica and Faydwer for the
majority of my 35 seasons I am now finally ready to head to Velious and do
some exploring. I have already procured my maps and lists of MOBS in the
zones, and am doing some research presently (EQ Atlas and Casters Realm
primarily). The trickiest things I've heard about in Velious (besides
staying alive of course) seem to be faction related  and I was wondering if
anyone had knowledge of a Site or a good forum board with some specific
input on Velious factions and their relations to all parties considered
(I.E. -  Dwarves hate ?, Dragons hate everyone and so on...). Thanks for the
input.
