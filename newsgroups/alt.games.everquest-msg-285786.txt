Some mobs are insta-popped when you go near the location (for your quest).

There have been some to date that have run all over the plaec grabbing all
the mobs when they could have waited where they were as the mobs do repop
quickly in some areas (like the newb area, where lots of people are after
the same things).

So far people have been quite happy to group for the common goal, I haven't
seen too many griefers as yet.
The quests I have completed so far which you would normally think were on
par with eq1/2 have been quite good.
Easy to do if you read the text rather than just clicking through as quickly
as possilbe to get it into your journal.
There have been a few people who have taken the quick clik approach who then
have to ask in /ooc what to do which is disappointing, but that's human
nature I guess.

The land mass is absolutely huge and you tend to find mobs nearer to where
the quest giver is so the population gets spread out a little that way too.

The PVP server on the otherhand was um...interesting.
Anyone over level 5 was fair game as well as having the mobs to contend with
(I made sure I didn't ding, I wanted tp find out more about crafting and
diplomacy).
