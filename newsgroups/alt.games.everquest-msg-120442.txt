Yeah, short term, we Wizards can do some pretty fast damage.  It's over long
term that we can't keep up to melees.

Maxed med skill gives something like 25 mana/tick.  Harvest effectively adds
another 3.  Figure with items, spells from Enchanters, etc., this can get up
to, say, 40 mana/tick.  (Someone feel free to jump in with more accurate
numbers...I'm just estimating here).  It looks like the most mana-efficient
DD is just shy of 5 to 1.

So, that gives an upper limit for damage over time for a Wizard of 200
damage/tick.
