Newbie sewing story:  it took me three characters to figure out how to 
sew.  I won't even bother counting the number of sewing kits, 
instructions, and pelts sold in disgust when I couldn't figure it out.  I 
kept asking everybody I saw who was a tailor "what do I do?" and they'd 
say "combine a ruined pelt and a pattern" and I'd say "I AM!" and sulk at 
my sewing kit because it was 'broken'.

Then I discovered the difference between 'instructions' and 'patterns'. 
:)
