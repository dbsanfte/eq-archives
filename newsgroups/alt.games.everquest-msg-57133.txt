No shit skippy, why do you think that was?
Was it perhaps your higher dual wield cap and higher weapon skills
combined with low delay weapons generating more aggro or was it
because you had "high taunt spells"?

Let me guess, you didn't stay at the edge of the melee bubble or your
main tank wasn't under Vindi's nutsack.

You know that there's more to giant aggro than taunt, damage or even
spells right?  If it wasn't, VI would never have had to nerf the piss
outta the "paladin fires DA and sits under the giant's nut sack while
it beats on it for 15+ seconds" tactic.
