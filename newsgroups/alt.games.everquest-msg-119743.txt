This reminds me of the night I was the only person in Chardok, was
sitting at zone in root dotting, and suddenly someone ran around the
corner towards me at full tilt. Damned near gave me a heart attack
(especially since I tend to play with only first names showing, so I
didn't see any GM guildtag over his head). An hour or so later,
another GM was there, so I asked if there was something wrong in the
zone. No, he and the other one just loved hanging out in Chardok when
they weren't too busy :)
