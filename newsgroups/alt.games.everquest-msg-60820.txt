One you do it on test, you're using it on the 'real' servers too.
Tried both tonight for a bit.

GForce 2MX (32mb) had some interesting things...  Rain is just wacked.
Seems like it just drops the clipping plane dramatically.  Really odd.
Had these flakey horizontal lines across my screen.  Real thin, and
they just kinda came and went.  Dunno.  Game play was smooth though,
no problems there at least - maybe even better come to think of it.
But the rain thing weirded me out and I changed the .ini file back to
DX7.
