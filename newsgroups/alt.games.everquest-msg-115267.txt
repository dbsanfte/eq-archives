Actually no, but its pretty clear that you lack an appreciation of sarcasm.

Im quivering in the face of your druid uberness.

Again, having trouble with the sarcasm concept? Keep working at it, you'll
get it eventually.

In this situation it really doesnt matter how he cares to play, hes on a
raid and under the direction of the raid leader.  Convenient how he didnt
have a problem disagreeing with said leaders direction until after the loot
was done.

Read Catcher in the Rye, I sense you will have a real affinity with the main
character.

He really didn't have to, he obviously would not have posted and the
conflict would not have existed if he had talked about it with the raid
leader ahead of time.  Even a shit for brains like me can surmise that, read
it again and you might see it.

Why would I feel concerned with your post or you, Im not really.  Boredom
after work waiting for a ride if you must know.  To think I really hold any
buring passion for any of these topics is funny really.

How do you know I dont have a Thurg gate potion :=) Im dragon/dorf faction,
I just mentioned giant faction as a possible reason, or didnt you see that?

I agree completely, but what is a guild made up of? People poncho, people..
if you dont think a guild rep can be seriously sullied by the action of one
person, try poofing the dain when someone is doing him, I guarantee that
might hurt a guilds rep.

Actually you must obey me, there was a memo crowning me king of all usenet.

Actually I have already won, the minute you went insane I owned your marker.
You tire me, please do me a favor and killfile me, it will make you feel
strong and save me the laughs, loved your post but god I dont know if I
could take much more of the laughter.
