"Quaint".  Fucking "quaint".  *sighs*

My old sig, which drew a lot of complaints, was:

Will be Anti-Christ for food.

After a real tense complaint from some lurker in the UO ng I apologised
profusely and changed it to:

Agent of Satan, but my duties are largely ceremonial.

(A chick in Frisco gave me a button with that on it).

I found my current sig on a calender titled "Jesus is coming, look busy" (or
something to that effect).
