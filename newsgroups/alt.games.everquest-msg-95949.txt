Slow spells are magic based not diseased based. According to the spdat.
For all enchanter and shaman slows. Druids and cleric have +disease buffs.

Granted disease is more important now with the release of Luclin due to
all the freakin' mushroom mobs that have diseased based attacks.

Hard AC from items generally better than the soft AC from agility but it
had to go somewhere on the list and AC is good for tanks.

Well they had to go somewhere on the list. They are definitely ahead
of INT, WIS, and CHR boosting stats. While STR benefit is minimal
to damage it is still something. And DEX is decent if you have weapons
that proc.

I think that 'soft' cap of AC of the 1200-1250-1300 has been lifted with
the newer expansions. That used to be true pre-luclin maybe even
pre-velious.
