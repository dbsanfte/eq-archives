i was not arguing that i owned the material

i argued that since i paid for it, i'm free to use it in *this* way -
violating the EULA does not equate to violating the law


if you go to ikea and buy a big lamp and the salesman says, "by buying
this lamp, you're saying you're going to light up a room but not roast
bugs that fly into the room, and if you do that, you can't use the
lamp anymore"

and then a bug flies in the room and you use the lamp to fry it (ewww,
this analogy sucks), are you suddenly now LEGALLY unable to use the
lamp? to light your room OR to fry bugs?


come on!

this is an entirely valid point, but for my own perverse reasons, i'd
like to play eq where the orcs in kelethin, after getting slaughtered
for their belts, learn to reinforce themselves and may someday attack
kelethin

i'm gonna give myself GM events every time i play

and all the ex-eq friends i have, who were never able to see the few
unique, story-changing events of eq ... well, they'll be happy they
kept their install CDs
