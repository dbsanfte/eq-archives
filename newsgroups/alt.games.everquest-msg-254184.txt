Not in the EQ client no... the screenshots are 'taken' before it passes
through the gamma corrector. This is not uncommon btw... Most of the games
I've bothered with screenshots on are like this.

It is my understanding you can correct this by adjusting the gamma
correction on the video drivers (as opposed to in-game). I've never bothered
to confirm as I have a good paint program available to me (Paint Shop Pro)
for manipulating images after the fact.
