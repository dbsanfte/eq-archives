Hi,

I'm quite new to EverQuest and my first serious character is a level 13 high
elven wizard.  The problem is I run out of mana really quickly.  I've been
solo-ing in WK and Butcher Block and killing Grizzly Bears, Giant spiders
and Giant Scarabs (which con blue to me) but to take down one beast uses 4
bubs of my mana.

I usually cast:  root - shock of lightning - shock of lightning - shock of
lightning and then walk up and pierce it to finish it off.

I had a look at my stats and noticed that I only put 115 points into
Intelligence.  Is this too low?  Is life going to get harder and harder for
me as I progress up the levels.  My big question is should I start again
(*sob*) - putting the maximum points into Intelligence?

Also If I do recreate the character I want to play on the same server with
the same name and keep the items I have accumulated.  What's the best way to
do this?

Thanks for any help and advice,

Roz
