Got some head piece in everfrost from a mad spectre, was dru.clr and
some more got AC4 +4 WIS and some more stats, not bad since my druid
is way low on wis, only 98 with the +4, being lvl 14 i go oom very
fast, could not kill a black skel to save my life, them new event ones
are tough, hard to hit and hits you hard.
