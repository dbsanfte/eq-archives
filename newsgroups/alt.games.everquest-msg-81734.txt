    Did he also go "tee hee!" at the end of that quote? Remember, this is
the SAME company that once told us the reason they saw such problems at
Ragefire was all the pressure clerics were getting FROM OTHERS to complete
the epic. Hmm, do you suppose they were applying that pressure so they could
have a chance at looting a Prayers of Life, or a Druicide stick?

    Hopefully it'll change. I regard this phase of things like a trial
balloon. You just have to remember that with Verant trial balloons go live.

    To be honest, we're no more screwed than a warrior is who wants his
epic. You have large competition on Sev in EJ, we have huge competition on
Rage in Skyfire. Your epic isn't quite as desirable as ours (less
competition on the bottleneck spawn), but you have more annoying steps than
we do. It does balance, in a way.

    Not quite - a guildmate could MQ the heart.

    A better approach for dealing with the issue would be to bring up this
point:

    As it stands now, a cleric doing the epic quest can kill the banished
Ragefire in Skyfire, THEN go to Sol B and "banish" him to Skyfire. The
entire ending of the quest script is out-of-order and meaningless. If the
epic container in Skyfire is made No Rent, then almost every cleric doing
the quest will go to Sol B FIRST to ensure they have what they need before
getting the No Rent heart. The script will then be followed.

    They'll listen to that.
