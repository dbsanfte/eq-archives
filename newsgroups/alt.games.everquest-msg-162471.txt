	Yes, it does.  *No other attack in the game requires a reagent for every
single attack, or even anything close to it*.  As someone on the Glade
recently observed, if Wizards had to spend something for every nuke, they'd
implode.  It wouldn't matter what it was.

	Play a Ranger to 60 and you will.

	Yes.  I'd run out of arrows every day, maybe every two days tops.  I'd
have to give up using acrylia (I couldn't possibly get enough of it), and the
Class 2 Steel Silver-Tips I used to use would probably be too expensive for
anything but Trueshot -- and I don't have the inventory space to carry two
different sets of ammo supplies.  It would mean going back to summoned arrows,
which quite frankly, suck.  

|For that matter, why in hell is
|EQ an all-or-nothing level to 59 and get a ton of AA thing?

	For the same reason Manaburn is.  That's the way it was designed.

	Sorry, but it is, and if you can't see that it's because you're ignorant
of what we go through.
