In MS Outlook Express, there's two ways to do that:
1)  I found out that right-clicking in Outlook Express does not offer 'block
sender'.  First select the post that you want to block, then at the top
menu, click on Message, then click Block Sender, then it asks "Do you want
to delete all the files now?" and just click Yes.  Voila!  All that BS is
gone!
2) Alternatively, from the top menu you can go to Tools > Message Rules >
News and create a New News Rule with Conditions & Action to delete
whomever/whatever you add in the 'From', 'Subject', 'Description', or
'Newsgroup'.  You can also remove the 'block sender' person from that list
too.
Hope that helps...
