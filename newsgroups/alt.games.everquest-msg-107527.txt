If you're only looking to buy, a Shissar Scale Cloak is a nice upgrade
for the back slot.  And the various tailored acryilia pieces would help
too and are well within your price range.

If you're willing to group a 50+ group can hunt pretty easily in the
Grey (and you have EB so that's not an issue) and you can get the
cloak there.  You've also got the chance (again in a group and this
only with people higher-level than you) of going to Umbral Plains
and getting the druid armor that drops there as well as a rare
chance at a Bracelet of Sense.   (One good high-level group can
get the Bracelet (depending on which one drops) and two groups
in the mid-50s are certainly enough.

And, IMO, selling Jade Reavers isn't a good way to make money
anyway.  Better off selling one of the nice Bracelets from Umbral,
many of which sell around that price.  Jade Reavers just aren't
on the market often enough to make it profitable.  And I'll forego
my own opinion (and that of many others) when it comes to
people who sell epic items like the Jade Reaver and Pegasus
Cloak.
