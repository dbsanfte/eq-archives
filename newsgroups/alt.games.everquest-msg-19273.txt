My solution is to very rarely ask for SoW with my monk. If you run around
without it all the time, you get used to it! :-)  I've always been reluctant
to ask a stranger for buffs of any kind.. I've gotten plenty of drive-by
buffings, and always thank the person (and spell it all out "Thank you very
much!!").

When I'm pulling for a group that doesn't have someone to cast SoW and I
don't have any potions, I do have to ask for it. I find someone who isn't
busy (i.e. isn't fighting, and is standing right in front of me). Then I'll
usually say "Pardon me, when mana permits could I possibly get SoW?"  The
person usually obliges.. can't remember a time when someone said "No, get
lost!" :-)

Be polite, and say "Thank you very much!" That seems to go a long way. Get
in the habit of saying "Thank you!" and you'll make a lot of friends. I
thank people that I'm grouped with all the time.. yeah, it's their "job" to
heal me or buff me, but I still appreciate it. :-)
