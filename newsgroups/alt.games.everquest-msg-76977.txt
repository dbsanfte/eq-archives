You can purchase a key to the Hole in a vendor's shop near the bank in
Paineel. (forget exactly which shop, but there's only a couple so search
around. I found it easy enough.) It will cost you better than 100 plat
depending on charisma and faction.

of course, to get *into* paineel, unless a native, you'll need to be
able to get a key from the newbie guards, for which you must have
amiable faction. Go into the warrens and kill about a thousand doggies
and you can do it. (Again, that's what I did.)

You don't tell us your race. My halfling rogue can worm through that gap
into the Hole (and does so regularly) with little trouble. With practice
it get's easier. I've seen dwarves fail when trying that. Never saw a
wolf or anything bigger make it through. Not saying it couldn't be
done... just I've never seen it. Halflings don't ever really need a key.
