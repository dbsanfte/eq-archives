From the shadows, the mysterious "Xenomorph" <spam@spam.com> (if that
IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

What you or any other single poster likes is irrelevent. From the
alt.games.everquest FAQ, section 5:

* Don't "Top Post", meaning your reply should be at the bottom of the
original message.

A newsgroup's FAQ can be considered the rules of conduct it
establishes at its forming.


>it doesnt hurt anyone to post the way you want (if its not messy).

Top posting in a bottom posting newsgroup IS messy.

>
>i preferre top posts.

Glad to hear it. The newsgroup does not. Follow newsgroup etiquette.

That said, I usually just reposition top posts in my reply (like I did
here) without mentioning it. The only people I (usually) ever address
about it are those who say they *know* the rules and defy them
anyways.
