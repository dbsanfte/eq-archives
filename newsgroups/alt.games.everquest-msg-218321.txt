From the shadows, the mysterious teckla@spamsux.com (if that IS his
real name) conspiratorially whispered:

His claim was based on nonexistance of contrary evidence ("there is
nothing wrong with the system because it has worked at every point
until 2000"), and he said that explicitly. Therefore he has
sufficiently fulfilled the "burden of proof" (a phrase badly misused
by people who don't understand what it means, including the person I
am replying to) and to defeat the argument you have to break at least
one of the premeses or give a valid alternative. You didn't. So sorry,
it's not "acceptable" to call "bullshit" without elaboration, unless
your goal is to look like a fool... in which case, mission
accomplished.

At worst, Khosh was guilty of a denial of the antecedent fallacy, but
that doesn't render his argument false.
