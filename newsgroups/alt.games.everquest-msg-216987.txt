Im not saying it doesnt happen, just that it hasnt happened to me, even on
the Oasis one where its a pit in the sand. If your observant its quite
abvious where the zone in will be. When it does happen you have to adjust.

Prudence = Fear ? Where you getting that ? It simply makes sense to use the
30 minutes your given prior to having to zone in to the dungeon to the
groups best advantage. That means to me a FM Cleric, and for that matter FM
for any of the other casters.

I See. Your assuming that some idiot melee went and zoned in before the
cleric had a chance to recover mana. If you had Zoned in at 5 mins while I
was still recuperating mana then you'd have found yourself less one cleric
in the group. Im very up-front and clear when I state in the begginning how
I want things to run, and if anyone has a problem with that then they are
free to leave before we even begin. If EVERYONE  ( including the impatient
melees ) wait for the Cleric to med up then there IS no difference.

Are you deliberately being obtuse ? Obviously once in the dungeon the mana
situation changes entirely. I never implied otherwise.  And this long "24
minute wait" that you are implying is also false on its face. Depending on
whether of not Ive got a KEI were talking about a mater of 5 mins tops. Any
melee who isnt willing to wait for 5 mins before entering the dungeon so the
cleric/other casters are FM isnt worth having in a group.
