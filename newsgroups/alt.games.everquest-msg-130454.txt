Yes, it would be.  No, I'm not suggesting it as a recommended course of
action.  I'm just pointing out that there -is- a military solution, and that
Isreal isn't employing it.  Hell, even their incursion into Jenine only had
54 palestinian deaths.  Not quite the 500+ slaughter that it was advertised
to be.

Who would be left to suicide bomb?  Only people -outside- the country.
There would be no more plaestinians to get ahold of nukes.  As far as the
outside nations... I'm wondering if they wouldn't think twice about
attacking.  We saw the quality of the Iraqi military, even their "elites."

Relations can be fixed later.  Especially if you had some high-ranking sorts
willing to fall on their swords to draw away America's wrath.  "All generals
responsible for this attack have taken their own lives...."
