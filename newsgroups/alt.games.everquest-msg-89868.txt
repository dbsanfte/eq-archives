Druids and Necros definitely. I've already seen both go to sixty solo.
(Though I hear it can get REALLY slow for the last few. Check with
Bizbee on that one, but I think it really bogs down then. Of course,
does for everyone. *shrug*) As to monks, most of ours have given up on
soloing entirely by 56. Yes, you can still find and solo light blues,
but there's too much stuff post 51 that either won't fall for the old FD
routine, or will reaggro as soon as you stand up.
