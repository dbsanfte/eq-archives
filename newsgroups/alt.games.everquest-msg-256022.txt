Heh, fine, spoil my objection by pointing out the obvious.  Although 
personally I find it easier to do the math than cast them on myself... I'd 
have to click off VoQ, KEI myself, read, click that off, reVoQ... that's 
like 3K mana! :)

Not sure... well, a quick poke thru lucy finds variation by level of the 
effects of Shield of Maelin (Self only anyway) Focus of Spirit and Khura's 
Focusing.  No other obvious enc/cler/shm buffs vary by level.

Well, from years of experience I know that the range of available mana 
extensions goes from 0% to 70%, and now 80% with an extremely rare GoD 
item.  So if I hear '15%', I know that's a respectable-but-not-much 
extension, and if I hear '75%' I know someone is either in the highest 
guild on the server or fibbing.  But if I hear '150 minute Virtue', I have 
no idea if that's good, or just the standard unextended one.  Do I donate 
more for 150 minutes?  Is it worth hoping a longer-lasting casting will 
occur in the next 10 minutes or so?  I'll need a while to figure out the 
ranges for each buff, now.

Well, you'd have been right.  120 min VoQ is 50% extended.  But now, do 
you go for the 150 min Fo7, or the 30% extended?
