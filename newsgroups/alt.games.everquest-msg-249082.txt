A distant rumble of thunder, and I ran to unplug the Cisco Router I was
using. It was already flashing it's d channel light.

It never saw an ISDN line again.

Of course netgears did that too. My current netgear has been online through
the worst lightning storm to hit the county in 2 decades, and never even
dropped it's line.

I am convinced my ISDN line is misgrounded or something. If I disconnect the
line from the (grounded) surge protector, then plug it back in, my speakers
'pop'
