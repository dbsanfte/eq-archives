And you had this new one made up for you to use. You haven't used this
email on usenet before. I don't believe you, but I will suspend my
disbelief. I imagine other fathers are here as well, listen up guys.

You posted about computer prgramming in other newsgroups, so I don't
believe you were duped. You just let her free-wheel. Many parents do.
TIme to wake up.

I hope we did. I hope we all scared the crap out of her. I have three
daughters, and if they did that I hope someone just uses words like we
did and scares them. Better scared then in a Mexican whorehouse
starring in a snuff film. How many teens do you think are missing in
the US?

Did you know about the girl who was held in Greece by a demented idiot
who lured her onto an airplane? Not an urban legend.

I would be mad too, but in the long run she better learn that this is
world wide communications. Many people have better tools and more time
than I do.

Be on guard. Ask her what specifically scared her, you may have to do
some checking yourself. She opened a can of worms here. I hope I can
scare the piss out of you too.

You dont know that. I make my living programming. I get pissed when
people deprive me of my living. I agree some EULAs are silly, silly
EULAs bug me too. I get mad at my employers/customers who use them. It
makes my work less popular.

People make money with games. People like Verant deserve to be paid.
Too many lawyers force Verant to protect themselves.

There is nothing civil about USENET. Every group has it's own canon of
law. If you even question that, they get pissed. This is indeed a
vocal group. I took my lumps as well at thier hands. But it is indeed
words.

Better cancel the account. She can still get in. I strongly urge and
recommend you move her PC out of your princess's room. Put it in the
living room.

It became my business when she got her soapbox out. She posted
publically. We have every right to respond. She raised peoples hackles
by TAUNTING THEM.

Are you sure she isn't scared that she was getting caught? I posted
every know address I found with that name, and other people were
analyzing her headers. We don't want cheaters in our community, and
Verant will delete thier account. Some people here pass that info
along to them.
