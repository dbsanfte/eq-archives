No.  There is nothing more, for you, druid.  The rest of EQ has used you to
further their own twisted schemes and will now discard you like an old shoe,
you know, the kind worn too often with unwashed socks so the smell cannot
really be removed no matter what you do.

So thanks for the help, but us non-druids have better things to do now, so
go hug a tree or dose yourself on holly berries or whatever you guys do when
you aren't being used by us.
