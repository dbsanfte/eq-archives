RyGorr drops from the mobs outside CC, primarily Elites, not inside.  I
think Messenger of the Queen is paladin only, so that won't do your SK
much good either; it does drop in CC though.

How about killing sentient armor in Wakening Lands?  Should be killable by
even a poorly geared 60 mage, drop SK only armor, although I have no idea
how frequently.

I find it extremely difficult to believe that the Bazaar on any server is
not populated by at least 250 people selling gear of all levels.  Not
having plat is an issue of course, but generating plat and turning it into
average gear for an SK is almost certainly going to be easier than
actually camping the SK gear in the first place.  A full set of RyGorr
will probably run you under 500pp, for example, or it could be the work of
several days to get it all to drop (and you'll be throwing away pieces you
already got... which is where the bazaar would come in handy, instead of
throwing it away, sell it!)
