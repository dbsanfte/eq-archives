He did say theoretically.  Theoretically you could also get a full
suit of Blazing Armor of Fennin Ro.  Actually, I think that will be
the point at which I decide that I've beaten EQ.  
I'm thinking, is PoA boring because the mobs aren't fun, or because
there is SOOOOO much downtime moving folks from island to island?
Guild may be doing a 12-man hunt there next week, and I'm thinking
that if you didn't have to kill, rez, summon, rez someone every 10
minutes, it might actually be kind of a fun hunt.
