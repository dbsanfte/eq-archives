    Sword of Blessings. For some reason, the Sword of Pain drops a LOT more
on our server. But that's not what I'm getting at. The SK has better
*droppable* equipment available, I think. So the average SK you meet in a
random group seems better at what he does because his gear which he got in
EC is better.
