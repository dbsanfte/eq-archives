Worse than that, EQ1 financed Planetside and that aborted attempt at
cloning Empire. Can't remember the name right now. As proof of your
suspicion, one of my guildmates was a guide for the various EQ expansion
Betas. He told me during the Gates beta that most of the devs he knew
personally had been moved to EQ2.

Basically they applied the traditional business model to a new kind of
business. It makes sense for Sony to finance the development of new TV's
from the sales of the current generation. For an ongoing revenue stream
like a MMOG, a different model might be more appropriate. However, if
they grow revenues with the people left playing EQ1 and the new people
playing EQ2 then their business model will have worked. If they find EQ1
is a ghost town in a year and EQ2 doesn't pick up the slack it will have
failed as a business model.
