I just recently started the Druid epic by obtaining the note the Burning
Wood.  I went to Gfay next to look for that Faelin Blood<something> to hand
the note to, but I couldn't find her.  I believe her place holder is an orc
pawn but I was killing them left any right.  Any ideas or suggestions? :)

TIA, Danny

BTW, anyone trying to raise their faction doinf the muffin quest so they can
receive the note can buy an unlimited supply of muffins from the butcher npc
in Thurg.  Verants says that due to the plague in the Karanas that it has
effected the crops therefore limiting the amount of vendors selling these
muffins needed.  I also heard they are sold on FV docks but I could not
confirm that.
