I like the sound of this ring's stats.  Do many people go and try to get any
of the above mentioned rings?  How hard is it to start getting them?  About
what LV do you go to look and is it a really long quest (like epics) or
anything involving many people or can it be done by small numbers such as a
single group?
    What are the values of most of the rings?  +100HP +10STA +10STR AC10 are
all great things for a warrior although I can see where other classes who
have little HP, STR, and STA would benefit just as well although I could see
where +100 HP would be higher value to someone who has 1000 HP than someone
of their same LV with 1500HP.
