Druids WERE too powerful once upon a time and everybody DID play them.
It's one of the things that gave druids such a bad name.  Now that
they have been given drawbacks commensurate with their strengths,
people are getting pissy.

My druid is 52, and I don't really have a problem finding a group when
I need one.  But if I'm not able to find a group I can always find
something constructive to do with my time, including grind out some
exp in a reasonable fashion.  How many of the Unholy Trinity
(Warriors/Clerics/Enchanters) can say that?
