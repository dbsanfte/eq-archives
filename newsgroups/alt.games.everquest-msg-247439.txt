Apropos of the original post (no longer available, so nothing quoted):

I've sprung to SOE's defense many times when I felt they were being
unfairly slammed. But, I think that I would have to pack it in if they
decided to sell in-game items for out-of-game cash.

This is from someone who has always said he would be there the last
day when they turned off the last server. But, I wouldn't stay for
that.
