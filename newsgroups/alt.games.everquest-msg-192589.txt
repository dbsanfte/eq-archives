   I guess this this would be a good place for an update.  Sieg
did indeed track me... but I wasn't visible.  About midnight I
heard from a guide.  She also tracked me but couldn't see me. 
The guide tried to /kick me off, then informed me that I probably
needed to have a /worldkick... doable only by a GM.  The guide
also tried killing all the named eyes in Beholders.. thinking
that would let charm wear off and let the system know that I
wasn't, in fact, an NPC and let me go LD.

   Didn't work.  Teafang is now going on her 25th solid hour of
being Linkdead.  And since she is on my main account, I can't
play any of my other main characters on any servers.  For once I
am glad that Test isn't so stable... because it's beginning to
look like I won't be playing until the server comes down.  And
I'm glad that EQ characters don't starve to death, because she
had some foraged goods on her, but not tons.  Though I suppose
it's possible that as an NPC she won't be eating or drinking at
all.

   I'm a little worried about what will happen when I do get on. 
With luck... and I think this might be the case... I will be
alive, but under the world.  If I ever do get to my character
select screen... I will watch myself spin for twenty minutes (per
sieg's suggestion), and the log in... at my bind point. 
/crossing fingers.
