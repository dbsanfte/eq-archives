yes it would be a list of components like you said ,with a trap making kit 4
slots or so.
level 1 trap =1 spider silk+burnt out lightstone+special whisky(special
whisky would  be a separate "mini"quest) +spider venom sack
will make a trap that will do "ignite"
just a starting point,set traps would be a 13 to 15th lev ability.The traps
would get more and more complex as the lev of the desired spell got.Possibly
including aoe spells.Hopefully Vareant watches this news group because it
would really make the rogue a more playable character.
