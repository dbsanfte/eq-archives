I can't comment on other solo capable classes like Mages or Druids or
Necro's but I think Bards are great at soloing.  I regularly charm
kite 20 mobs in Plane of Disease, and from what I understand 20 mobs
is not a very big swarm compared to what other Bards can do.  I have
been grouping as of late because charm kiting can get monotnous.  The
only time it gets exciting is when there is a lag spike and I'm
wondering if I'll make it alive.  Otherwise, I can swarm kite for an
hour and take no damage.

Now, if we are talking about killing just one mob I would venture to
guess that other classes like Mages and Necro's can kill mobs faster
than a Bard.  If I twist all four of my DoT's on a mob I can do around
3240 points of damage over a minute.  I'm pretty sure Mages and
Necro's can dish out more damage over time but 3240 over a minute
isn't too shabby.

Keep in mind I'm speaking from the perspective of a level 57 Bard. 
However, the charm kiting tactics can be used starting at level 27.
