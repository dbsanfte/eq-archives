God, yes. The shawls through the fourth aren't all that bad. I get them
for all my caster/healer twinks, in fact; they are that easy. All you
need to get the griffon eggs is a tracker and a couple of hours. No
biggie. The fifth and up start getting *really* ugly though, because of
the tailoring skill you need.
