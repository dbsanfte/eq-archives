That's kind of a good point.  Perhaps I misspoke saying that the ownership
is irrelevant.  I still say your argument falls short and here is why:
In the case of the GGB you have no right to sell the bridge in any way.  It
is clearly a fraud.  In the case of the plats I would say it is more like
the monopoly analogy that someone posted in this thread.  Say you sell
Boardwalk for $20.  But it is not your game, it is your friends game, you
are just playing at his house.  But you are obviously not selling the
cardboard playing piece that represents boardwalk, you are selling the
boardwalk "real estate" that only exists for as long as the game lasts.  The
cardboard piece is not the same thing as the real estate.  You 'own' the
real estate because you have legitimate control of it.  You do not own the
cardboard piece because you are just borrowing it while you play the game.
People are confusing the plat that exists in game and is owned by whoever
controls it, with the game itself that is owned by sony.  Sony may own the
entire game but within the game you do have ownership of 'things' for as
long as you play.
