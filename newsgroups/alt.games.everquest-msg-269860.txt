I'd probably strip and dump, but:
a) I would not want to pay for more than one account.
b) I happen to like many of the mid level stretches.
c) Being a high level enchanter, I think there is no substitute for 
grouping to know your limits and capabilities *in any class*, and more 
importantly, how other classes compliment you.
Minor d for ench) Also enchanter soloing for real xp (charm soloing) is 
much different than working in an xp group, who will usually look at you 
cross eyed if you mention charming for normal xp. I imagine other 
classes have similar issues; solo or duo style may be far different than 
group style. Wizards don't quad kite in groups...
(Mind you, we had a very successful group where we were charming... We 
had 2 druids, enchanter, mage, cleric, and our tank left. We were 
fighting somewhere with good charm animals, so we started using 3 
charmies. Toy laden pets, and the cleric fell asleep and we didn't 
notice till our big hp buffs ran out.)
