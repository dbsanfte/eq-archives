When in my late teens and 20s I would carry around some extra gold pieces
around 100 while grouped I would PP and split quite often even if it meant
dipping into the reserve I was carry. Built up a good reputation that way. I
always ask if the group if I may PP write down or state how much I am
carrying in cash and split regularly. I always have a pen and paper close by
to keep a tally. After mid forties players could care less about the few
plat the mobs carry more interested in drops. It would be nice if there
would be a message telling the group how much you PP that way Rogues
wouldn't get such a bad rep unless the deserved it
