I had the same problem. I exported the text file BZR_Tradername_##.ini
to Excel and sorted it alphabetically. Looking through the file I
found duplicate items with different prices. I deleted the duplicate
entries and saved it as a text file. After I copied the clean text
file back into the Everquest directory, my trader showed all my items.
