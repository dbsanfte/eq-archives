Hmm, sure worked on me, it didn't take any longer to read than if it had 
all be spelled correctly... once I got over the Full Stop every time I 
hit a misspelled word.

I had a friend in high school who was dislexic, I ended up riding around 
with her a lot because she needed someone to read directions and tell 
her which way to turn.  No, not tell her, POINT, because she couldn't do 
"left here".  I always wondered how she could read, and she was a pretty 
avid reader.  She said it really wasn't a problem, although she couldn't 
spell worth a damn.  This might have something to do with it.

Hmm, I didn't look at it that way, that would be an unfortunate side 
effect.  I just found it an interesting comment on the human brain 
processing power.  I mean, reading has only been around what, 10,000 
years or so?  And only popular for a tenth that at best?

Pattern recognition, thats our claim to fame I'm guessing!

Which certainly agrees with the rule of five from the appendices of the 
Illuminatus trilogy
