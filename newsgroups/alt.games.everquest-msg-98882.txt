This "phenomenon" has been going on for years. And for very good reason: EC
is essentialy the central hub of the area. Everyone can get to it, and the
tunnel where everyone hangs out is safe for all.
If you want to get rid of the spam, just turn off the auction channel
instead of whining.

Personaly, I was quite glad for the whole thing when I was newer, as it
helped me pick up general pricing guidelines quickly. It also tends to
attract charitable upper level people (including myself, occasionaly) that,
while looking for an item, will heal/buff newbies that wander by.

Nothing about what these people are doing is stupid/idiotic, it's quite
logical and convienient.
