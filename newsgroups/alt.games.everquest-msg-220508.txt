	Don't *need* this...we get plenty of regen from our own spells.

|Tolans Breastplate

	This is depricated these days between the Knowledge portals and the LDoN
guys, but I still wouldn't part with mine...30 seconds from anywhere, any
time.

|Tolans Bracer

	Must-have prior to EndQ.

|Horse

	Nice, but we end up working indoors too often.

|Solstice Earring      (FT1)

	Easy to get, shame not to have one.

|Dark Cloak of the Sky (50% self haste)

	This is a soloing toy, and probably not worth the effort.  The rare drop
is INSANELY rare.

	Rangers had the best epics of the fighting classes, until the Beastlords
jacked them with upgrades. :-P

	I thought that was "fixed" a while ago.

	The spheres are not that hard to get.  Venril Sathir is another matter.
Now that Runes don't block his lifetap he's very difficult to kill, unless you
bring a huge amount of nukage.  Best option is probably to bring two or three
Manaburners.  (He can be killed by one crit Manaburn.)
