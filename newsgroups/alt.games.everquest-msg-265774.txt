Ok, that may also be part of the archetype system (though I think that
fails for other reasons[1]), but since you can always choose to betray
your city if you want the opposite alignment, the archetype system is
still compatible with the alignment system.

[1] The only one I can think of off hand is that mages don't get pets,
you have to be a summoner for that, but I think there are more
examples of this.
