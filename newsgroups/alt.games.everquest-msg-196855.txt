Last night I had my beastlord in Dawnshroud, after a really bad day at
work, and I was happily hunting shrooms for about three hours.  There
is an area with a building full of them, plus three more outside, and
they respawn very quickly.

All of a sudden a player moved in front of me and informed me that his
shaman was 'camping' this spot and I would have to leave.  Now, in
three hours, I hadn't seen either this player or the shaman and I had
been circling the building pulling shrooms, so I have no idea where he
was.  He said he'd been camping the spot for 6 levels.  Perhaps he had
literally camped out his shaman in the spot and when he signed in he
saw me and told me to leave?  I really don't know, I can say only that
I did not see him.  He insisted that he'd been 'calling' the camp for
many hours (I didn't see that, either).

Given the spawn rate in the area, I told him there were plenty of
shrooms to go around and since I'd been there for three hours already
I didn't really see a need to move on.  He followed me around and
watched me kill a few shrooms and then stood in front of me again and
said, 'I'm trying to be nice here, please leave'.

Frankly, I don't think he was being nice at all.  I perceived he was
trying to bully me.  His guild tags were from a prominent guild and I
feared making many powerful enemies, so I left...but it really ruined
the evening, topping off a truly awful day...sigh...

So what would you have done?  What are the rules, written and
unwritten?
