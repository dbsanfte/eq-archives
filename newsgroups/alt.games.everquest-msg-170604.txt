This second one seems to work as well as its going to get. I still see the
slots as mis-named, and I don't think its my PC.
Ears: Cougar claw and/or Wolf Fang are next upgrades. Griffons or Va Shir
are more expensive. I don't know the drop rate of Sarnak Earring of Station,
but I don't see many people wearing them.

NEck:  Was that amulet supposed to be the magiked one, with AGI/STA?  Even
so, I'd prefer to see a warrior in more functional jewelry if he must
(Golden Pearl, or Platinum Topaz), else get a cheap Spider fur collar

Head:  A Skul shaped Barbute would replace that BIC quite nicely for less
than 150pp.  But keep the BIC for resists later, or move up to the BAC

Shoulders: Crafted and Tattered mantle have one more AC (tattered also
having HPs)

As for all the Crusty I cannot comment, having never had any. I've heard its
in the same area as Rygorr, Crafted, possibly Twilight. Up until your 40s -
unless you spend a lot of time fighting casters - I would concentrate more
on AC and HPs rather than resists and stats.

Hope this helps; or at least breeds discussion.
