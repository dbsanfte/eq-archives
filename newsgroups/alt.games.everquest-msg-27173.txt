I had a good, full group that has been pulling in DL for about 3 hours in
the same spot (I hadn't actually moved for about 1 hour, stand cast med,
stand cast med...)  This druid is kiting nearby, her rest spot is safely out
of agro range for us, and we are all aware of eachother.

DruidBitch parks a 51% dead mob next to a medding wizard (me).  She was
clearly kiting it, so who am I to take it?  Oh, yeah, I'm the guy it just
did 200 points to.

My whole group reacts... "OH MY GOD, somethings beating on the wizard"

I realize, quickly what has happened... so I scream at them, "don't touch
it!  She wants to kite it, let her finish it... we're not going to do her
work for her."  (She may have been LOM, but she wasn't LOH, and she
definitely didn't /yell).

So I move away from the rooted mob (well actually I did that first by
instinct, but stil...)

She gets up and finishes the mob right after she (probably) sees the whole
group react, then back off.

ME: /tell DruidBitch "Please don't do that again."

-no response-

Ten minutes later mob chasing her runs up, and is parked right on top of me.

Me jump away, again like 100 points in the time it took me to stand up.

This time tmy group doesn't react (being that they knew not to, and we were
dealing with our own pull).

ME: /tell DruidBitch "Do NOT do that again."

-no response-

Ten minutes later mob chasing her runs up, and is parked right on top of me.

Me jump away, again like another 100 points in the time it took me to stand
up.

ME: /g "get ready for a war with this druid."

ME: (for some reason had "nullify magic" memmed) /cast Nullify Magic on MOB.

It is suddenly not dotted, not rooted, and not snared.  (Actually, I'm not
*sure* about the DOTs).

She was hit pretty hard before she got up.  I don't know if she lived or
not, but she didn't kite near us again.
