do you by chance have an nvidia MX card? (Geforce 2 or 4).

If so, there are known problems with EQ and those cards that would
result in what you described, due to the fact that MX cards do not do
DirectX9 functions on the board, but emulated in the drivers.

See this post from a TSR with recomended earlier drivers to try:

It will fix the skin problems, but will make trees look flat, it's a
tradeoff.
