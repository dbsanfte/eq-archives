The velious armor updates are just textures so they look how they're meant
to when you're wearing them ... nothing should ever vanish that you're
wearing from or your backpack ... I'd petition myself and see about getting
the items returned. Be sure that no-one else has access to your account that
could have moved/sold/dropped them without you knowing before hand to save
embarrasment :)
