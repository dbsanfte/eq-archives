Pick up a green silken drape from a player - they're usually very
cheap, they have some nice stats (although the AC isnt much cop)
and, most importantly, they work as "Affliction Haste II" making your
DOTs cast faster, and incidentally possibly save your life.

I'd also recommend picking up some extremely cheap wolf fur slippers
which have spell haste I on them; for most this is useless (level 20
spells and below only are hasted), but for necromancers the all important
feign death is, and remains, a level 16 spell, and one where the extra speed
in casting can save your life many times over.
