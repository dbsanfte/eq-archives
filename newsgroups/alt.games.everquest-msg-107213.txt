Allright a good place to hunt for you is to go hunt in Unrest until you are
level 23, then head over to Paludan Caverns(Not sure if thats how you spell
it) but its in luclin and it is the best place for good fast exp, and also
loot. I got 100pp in 1 day there. When you hunt in Paludan you hunt the
Bandits (Like high level dervs) they are very fast spawn. And you have to
have a good big group to kill them all really fast over and over.
