You don't agree?  Only arguement I can think of would be that the
Druid pet might be worse.. but at least that one is persistant, so it
can be relied upon to save the AFK druid from aggro greenies... I
once died from a BIXIE when my daughter cut herself and I went
AFK for an hour taking care of her.  When I got back to the keyboard
I was loading please wait and there was -nothing- on scroll up but
thousands of "A bixie hits you for one point" messages.
