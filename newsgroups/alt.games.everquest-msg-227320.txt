*Most* desirable, maybe, but not exclusively desirable. If you have to 
wait for loot that is best suited to your race/class to get a drop, then 
you'll either wait longer or only hunt where your chances are better at 
getting something. With random, you still have the same number of 
opportunites for that nice upgrade, but those aren't the only 
opportunites you get.

Desirable to whom, exactly? No offense, but your title which authorizes 
you to speak for the rest of us is what, again? :P

I love more opportunity to buy gear. As you, yourself, pointed out, we're 
dealing with massive mudflation after all. Why limit yourself to stuff 
you can loot when you can get much better in the Bazaar?
