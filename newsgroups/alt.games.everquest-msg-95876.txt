some zems reached 100 as a result of the patch (the hole is an example), but
no zones exceeded it.  The only zone at 100 before that patch was Kedge
i believe.

The numbers are a bit screwey at low level.  At lvl 6 and under, a "newbie"
zem of 100 is applied to kills regardless of zone.  The split with a lvl 2
and 1
should be 7/13 and 6/13.  The other factors that may contribute to this are
the exp cap.

You cannot recieve more than 11% of your level in a single
reward.  At lvl 1 you only need 900~1600 exp to level (dep on class/race)
so you are effectivly limited to 90-160 exp per kill, and if your split is
more
the exp gets capped.  I imagine this might be more noticable grouping at
low lvls than normal.

Other possible "leaking" of exp is killing green/light blue
cons that give "you gain exp" (yes, i realize this woulndt be your problem
since
you are lvl 1 :).  Green cons that give exp are divided into 2 groups, high
and low
depending which of the 2 green/light blue levels is closer to you.  high
gives
50% exp, and low gives 25%.  So basically, if its light blue by 1 level, you
only
get half exp, if by 3 levels 25%.

Were any pets involved?  at low levels they have a knack for gettign 51%
damage.

And lastly, was this after or before the patch where they changed experience
and ZEM stuff.  If it was before, then exp and groups played by an entirely
difference set of rules.  If you'd like, i can go over what those were.

If it still doesnt make sense, and you care to figure it out, post some more
details
and i can see if i can put together the scenario from a numbers perspective.

Experience needed to level is a function of Level, race, class, and "hell
modifier"
(this is what causes the abrubt jumps in the exp curve, the mathmatical
cause
for "hell" levels)

the formula is lvl^3 * race mod * class mod * hell mod

race mod is 100 for most races, 95 for halflings, 110 for barbs and ogres,
120 for trolls and iksar, and i really dont remember the breakdown for the
rest of the races.

hell mod starts at 10, and at lvl 30 starts increasing by 1 every 5 lvls,
until 50
where it does nothing, then at 51-53 it increases 1 each level, then it
increases
by 2 from 54-58, where it increases 3 to 59.

thats from memory, may be off, i'll doublcheck later and post corrections if
needed.

Experience needed to level yeilds total lifetime exp to achieve that level.
If you want
just exp to get a certain level, you must calculate exp for level X and X-1
and take
the difference, and that is the exp needed to get through level X.

notice that while class mod raises exp requirements, the exp you get is also
scaled to
this value, so this part of the penalty is compensated for.  The race
penalty
however is not countered, so an ogre will still need more exp than a human,
regardless of class.
