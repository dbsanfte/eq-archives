It was more a case of not finding out about it soon enough. I didn't
even arrive at the pass until around nineteen, and I was a troll, so KOS
at the time. It actually took a couple of levels before I'd killed
enough to get up near indifferent. Then, of course, I was able to go
down in the basement and do the ear quest and got good faction there,
and in Freeport.

(Of course, since then, I've tanked for about a dozen Pally Epic kills
there, so all that was for naught.)
