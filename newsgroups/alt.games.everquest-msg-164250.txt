I wouldn't think one level difference, same spell, on blue mobs would make
that much difference.. and actually a couple of levels earlier I had had
great success with charm in the same area. And this was before the wonky
'resist much more based on relative level' changes they made. (which are
giving my twinked out mid teens mage alt fits.. pull a red, pet solos it, I
burn half my mana and never do any damage due to resists, get only 8% xp for
the kill :P).

I think the RNG just doesn't like me (I charmed a green the other day for
someone to do a quest. Had to recharm 7 times was getting <5 second
durations. And don't get me started on having 703 combines at 255 int to go
up one skill point in jewelry making at <200 skill. yeesh.)
Hmm time for my self control chant.
