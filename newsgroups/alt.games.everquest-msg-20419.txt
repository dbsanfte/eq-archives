I prefer to think of Stan as my Combine. Hoes are so 19th century.

I hope for your sake that english isn't your native language.

> why defend that fucker when i came on here in 
>peace and asked i simple question? 

RTFM.

>i never came on here
>raving and ranting about how to get somewhere..i asked nicely

Just think, you could have avoided it all if you had just RTFM.

Plus, it doesn't exactly bespeak your "come on here in peace" when your
followup posts have about every 5th word be some crude insult. Clearly you
just ACHE for a reason to hurl your 3rd grade level flames.

>..but oh
>no..some guys gotta act like it there job to be judge and jury and harrass
>folk who as a simple question

Assing a question? I know ace ventura...you sir, are no ace ventura.

>..you dont know my motherfucker ok!! 

Neither do you...I'm sure he walked out after fucking your mother and she
doesn't even know his name.

>AS I SAID

>like the are the shit and gotta correct everyone on here..FUCK YOU STANMANN
>and MATT FUCK...oh my bad lol..Frisch ,fag whatever..

Homophobic loser.
