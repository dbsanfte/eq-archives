Rogue; once you hit 10th so the rogue gets backstab, you just keep the
mob focused on your out of reach self while the rogue walks behind
the snared mob stabbing it in the back.  HIs Evade will help keep the
mob focus where you want it.

Enchanter is another nice one, speed your mana regen up, mez the
adds, gets Fear to go with your snare for kiting (and a DOT
works full on a feared mob, unlike one that is chasing you in
a traditional kite)

Although my cleric spent a lot of time partnered with a druid,
its not really ideal unless your cleric is a tank junkie like I am;
cleric -does- get fear to fear kite with, but his nukes aren't as
efficient as yours, and he doesn't get a mana regen for either
you or himself.

Monk is decent, your relatively sucky heals will go further on
a monk (who takes less damage) than on a warrior type tank,
and his ability to FD means he rarely dies when things go south,
unlike so many tanks who wait too long and then can't outrun the
pursuit even with SOW on.  ALso, can use FD like rogue's Evade
to keep the mob chasing you while he hits it in the back.

I find real tanks to be inefficient  druid partners; hard to get stuff
off of them, they keep sucking up mana for heals, and don't lay
out the kind of damage a rogue or monk can.  THis is, of course,
their job description... just not one that makes a particularly
attractive druid partner.  Best thing about em is that they will
keep your target still so DOTS have full effect.  Of the
three, SK probably the best as they have Fear and a pet you can
hand a rusty halberd to and get some help in fear kiting.  Unlike
necromancers, their snare and pet suck, so you won't be a fifth
wheel.

Wizard is a decent choice, you'll both get self port in your teens,
so you'll be able to travel together (more or less, its seperate
destinations mostly) long before you would with any other partner.
If you are using snare and DD, then the wizzard will really shine,
and when you graduate to quad kiting the wizard druid partnership
will shine even more.  You'll both end up medding a lot, mind you.

Mage isn't a terrible choice, although there's nothing particularly
synergistic about it; still, with the pet tanking and both of you
nuking you can take down some pretty powerful mobs.  Again,
you get the benefit of stationary mobs for DOT purposes.

Shaman... dunno, have yet to try this out, really.  Would think
not too handy, you only need one SOWer, and since druid
tactics involve not touching the mobs, his buffs and haste and
slow capabilities won't be all that useful.

Bard.  Hmm, again, not too great, all those buffs pretty much
a waste unless he decides to tank for you... and even with his
best self buffs running he's not much of a tank.  Bards are
great because they boost performance of the whole party,
the smaller the party the less the benefit.  On the other hand,
druid/bard would be quite handy with the addition of random
pickup partners, and there's always the manasong to consider.

lastly

another druid.  Well, if you are root/DOTing, this is a pretty
poor solution, as your DOTs won't stack, this is pretty much
just a bigger mana pool (and a doubled mana regen)  But if
you are snare/DD kiting, you'll be able to kill twice as fast
and med back twice as fast, while having help with adds. Just
as with wizards, you'll be a porting pair at 19, instead of at 29.
Seems to me, though, you'll have a hard time getting groups, and
you won't really be much better off than soloing; kill twice the
mobs but split exp two ways.
