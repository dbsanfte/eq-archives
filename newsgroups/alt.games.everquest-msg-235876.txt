In case some of you haven't seen this yet, there is a new
everquest-related comic up at http://reflex.corey-art.com.

.....and if you go to his forums and sift through the guy's artwork, you
can see a picture of Foxeye that he drew for me. ^_^  You'll probably
recognize Sally (for those of you who remember me going on about Sally).
