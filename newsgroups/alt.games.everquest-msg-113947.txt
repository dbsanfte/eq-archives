While I am suprised at the the refusals, if the druid was standing there. I
can understand the ignores.

I was helping a friend Steamfont the other day for his Hero Bracers. I
didn't go anon, and in the span of 20 minutes I had 4 direct tells for port
requests and 1 for a freebie PL. I actually burned half a mana bar on the
freebie PL guy and didn't even get a "Thank You" - just a request for more
buffs as the DS wore off. Now this may seem handleable in a 20 minute span,
but trying to politely explain to people why I can't run across the zone to
port them - or port to another zone entirely to port to yet another zone,
only to come back here to help my friend, quickly becomes a tell hell. It is
pretty easy to miss a new tell coming by.

My druid is now 53, I have NEVER turned down a request for SoW - even a "sow
me dude". I have never turned down a port request unless I was in a group or
was actively engaged in a quest or helping a friend or Guild mate. It has
taken me over 60 days played to get to 53, much of that time has been spent
either helping other folks (complete strangers) or medding up after PL'ing
or porting them around. Please don't tell me in a public forum that people
who play druids are some kind of anti-social throwback. Maybe when your
Enchanter gets clarity, you'll start burning 30% of your play time buffing
complete strangers who won't so much as say "Thanks". Or you'll build up a
tank to stand there and take damage while expecting nothing - not even exp -
in return. And when you do, you'll get to read about someone who thinks they
got screwed by - not "A" Enchanter - but by the whole enchanter class and
the people who play them.
