It's a racial skill, not a Paladin skill.  It allows you to become invisible
while not moving.  The only way you can tell if it succeeds, unless you are
a rogue, is to con a mob before hiding, and after hiding.  If the mob was
not indifferent before hiding, but was after hiding, then you have
succeeded, and you are now invisible.
