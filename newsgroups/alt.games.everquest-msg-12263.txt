Yours maybe a different problem but I do know that mine at least sometimes
is memory related because the computer grinds away just like it does when
you have a memory problem.  Heck, it can sometimes take me 2 minutes to
zone! (Not good for trying to get off the boat at Freeport before you rezone
back to OOT again hehe).  Wiz and Dru constantly tell me they think they
lose me when I get a GG.  So you see for me, at this stage anyway (I'm
saving for a new computer), getting kicked to the server screen is just
another minor delay in the whole process of zoning.
