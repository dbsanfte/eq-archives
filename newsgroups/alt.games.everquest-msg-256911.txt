Mana/hps healed  ratio is better on Superior,cause I 
use Imroved Healing 2 Focus Item.But I think its more
a matter of taste and rarely would the cast time make
a difference during normal play.

I nuke a lot,not long ago my Evocation was higher than my
Alteration skill!
Not sure if the hammer is worth the mana,if it attacks mob
from the front,I see much more misses,dodges,ripostes
and parries than actual hits,and with mobs going down
under 1 minute in easy Ldons it becomes more questionable.
I tend to use it only on casters in the hope I get lucky hit 
in,which stop them from casting.
Ok,you have it as a clicky effect.

Point of having more than 1 Stun memmed is to be able to
stun casters reliably,there are a lot of healer mobs especially
in BB Ldons(Bloodguard Caretaker).
Best would be to have 4 stuns memmed,3 isnt sufficient,
with 4 Stuns I could stun a caster completly for the whole fight,
if I have not too much resists.

Now look what we are talking about:nukes,pet,stuns,pulling
and even meleeing. 
I made the cleric with the intent to relax a little,thought my only
job would be to (complete) heal the tank after every fight.
Man ,was I wrong.  :)
Have a lot of fun with him,especially turning down all the guild
invites,never ever can I imagine to sit in a boring CHC in a boring
raid.
