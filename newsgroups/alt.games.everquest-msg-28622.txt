I'm curious, SJ.  What equipment do you feel has gone obsolete in only
two months? No new releases came out with piles of new gear while you
were gone, and the only ubergear that's being handed out is primal
vellium from ST and a couple things that dropped off the Avator of War,
but I doubt there's enough of either in circulation to make any previous
items obsolete. Could it be that your regular groupmates/guildies have
made a couple levels while you were gone, perhaps? I know that's my fear
when going away for a time.
