They are in the usual places, but at least the 34 one was misnamed by the
sites.  They called it renewal and I spent hours hitting every cleric guild
to find it.  Finally gave up and started checking mana usage on spells.
When I found the one that used the amount of mana between revive at 29 and
resuscitate at 39, I took a shot...and sure enough, it was the right one
(uses 400 mana, but sorry can't remember name right now).  I was really
disappointed because usually castersrealm and alkazzam (which I pay for
premium service) are a little more accurate in their information.....
