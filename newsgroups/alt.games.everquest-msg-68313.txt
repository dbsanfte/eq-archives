I think Verant need to hire justsomedude to do their programming I just used
EQW newest release last night. First off I have 2 machines on my home DSL
network using EQW on one so I can check WebPages. I was booted 3 times on
the computer without EQW, and not even the slightest hint of lag on the
other computer. Next I ran EQW on the computer I was having Link Dead
problems with and ran great. Next step was to close EQW on the other
computer and run the Everquest interface and with in 20 minutes I was
booted. while EQW computer is Rock solid. To that justsomedude only worked
on his interface 2 maybe 3 weeks and it runs so much better. No stuck Mouse
pointers, considerably more stable, and better memory management, Plus being
able to access the Internet while online.
