Point would be well taken if all this additional content worked properly and
customer service was reasonably responsive.  I understand, of course, the
increase in infrastructure costs, but you'd think that the marketing folks
could've at least lied a little and said that they would be increasing the
number of CSRs to address the issues associated with the changes in
technology.

Personally, $3 more per month is no big deal -- I still spend more than $13
per month on coffee so, relatively speaking, $13 per month isn't painful.
However, I would like to see that extra 30% go to resolving existing
problems and ensuring a smoother deployment for the next expansion.
