There are 4 seperate factions in MMC.  Not sure how they relate to
each other, and I've never seen anything that actuallly *raises*
faction with these groups, but generally, the more time you spend in
MMC, the more likely they are to take a swing at you just for looking
at them funny.

As an aside, would aggro radius increase as faction gets closer to
absolute zero?  Does that hold true for non-LDoN mobs as well?
