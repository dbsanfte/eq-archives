Yep, as I've already mentioned, I've seen it before.  Mailbombings, tons of 
xposts, you name it--much of it just from sheer spite, and that's a 2-way 
street, BTW.   In a few weeks things will settle out one way or another, and 
then it'll give everybody a chance to make some rational decisions.

I love a cozy nest as much as anybody, but in the real world nothing remains 
static, and like it or not, EQ2 is *not* simply going to disappear.  It's a 
part of the EQ world from now on, and anybody who doesn't want to deal with 
it had best be setting up a private webforum--or become pretty damned adept 
at filtering.
