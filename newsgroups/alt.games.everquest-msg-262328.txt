I finally created a magelo profile and was wondering what other druids/monks
think of my equipment eg any item that i really should aim for? I haven't
got much chance of raiding due to time limits but would do anything else eg
ldon if it leads to a stronger set of equipment?

I gave up on getting my epic; was having trouble with epic 2 mobs getting in
the way; same with getting my coldain shawl, ah well.
