Thanks for the tip.  One of the guildies that I often duo with is a
shaman.  After a level we take turns pretending we're tanks, so I know
I'm not toooooo far away from where I should be.  But I'm sure my
defense could be better.

Upon checking the logs on my 26 cleric (I *think* I have them all) it
would appear that my defense is currently at 45, my 1hb is at 91 and
offense is around 121. 

I suppose now I should find a website to determine how far off I
really am!
