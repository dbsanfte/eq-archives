Reasons vary, but on Quellious, at least, it was generally accepted that Guk
(SRo) were the hardest/slowest to complete, and had an annoying run to the
entrance for the ones inside Upper Guk.

Also, the charmable mobs were far more common, but, like all LDoNs, were
unsnarable and had about 2x the hitpoints of other mobs.  This plus the
multiple pulls made Guk my favorite by far.
