It can be done not PoP perhaps but that doesn't mean you don't want to be
able to take some hits when need be.
Its also real handy for when something goes wrong like the main tank takes a
dirt nap and someone has to finish a fight.

I've parsed a disembowler a Falchion of Storms and a Windworn Handblade non
of those outdamage my windblade. The other choices you've offered are either
less desirable because of ratio SBOZ FG KT or to slow to be worth a damn
defenders lightblade LSoEE Blackened Acrylia Blade, or in the case of a BOC
to big of agro generators. You wanna talk about a stupid weapon choice for a
ranger that's about as dumb as you can get.
The slow high ratio weapons aren't an option at the upper levels of the game
because swifties haste and ATK bonus's make it the damn near irreplaceble
and you sure the hell wouldn't want to use them as a mainhand because of the
damage bonus.

Doesn't matter there are game mechanics issues involved.

We're talking about rangers and most rangers in that level range have manged
to pick up swiftwind. Even if they haven't it still wouldn't outdamage a
windblade.
I had a Windworn Handblade and sold the damn thing cause it seemed silly to
have such an expensive weapon when my windblade could generally outdamage
it. It was especially silly when my bow so seriously out did it.
And disembowler didn't significantly out damage the HoH I used for a long
time.

I'm not talking shit or mathmatical formula I parsed em. and tested to see
which did best. And the final outcome was all other things being equal the
windblade owned every dual weild set up I tested.

Bah, So no new ones.
Once again some may be a tad better in the pure DPS dept (warmarshals for
instance) but they loose out in other depts. The weapons you are talking
about have lower ratio's and lower delay's which detract from the primary
benifit of going two handed. Which is reduction of riposte damage to you and
increasing it to the mobs.
