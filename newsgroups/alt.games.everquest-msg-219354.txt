there are (unsurprisingly) problems with the system. but that doesn't mean we
should abandon the system. we should continually strive to make it better. if
you're fortunate enough to live in a representative democracy (like me) then
it's within your power to change things.

as teckla pointed out, that's just not fair if society is expected to shoulder
some (or all) of the burden.

i like to tell people this: the representative democracy form of government
stinks, but nothing else seems to work better.
