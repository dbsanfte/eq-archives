Yes. And they'll all be held either while most of us are at work, or in 
the dead middle of the night on a weeknight.

I'm guessing pieces of armor from the completely uber "Galaxia 
Craptastica" line. Worn effect: "Stun Allies" making all guild and group 
members fall down laughing when they see you wearing it, unable to move 
for up to 120 seconds.

Oh, it's just got to be Mayong Mistmore finally making his return. 
They've only had five years to fix the fucker. Odds on how long it takes 
him to wipe out the zone as soon as somebody aggros a level 20 mob at 
the entry ramp?  Of course now he'll hit like RZtW and be harder to 
reach than Quarm.

> Fireworks display: Lighting up the sky in celebration!

Oh boy. I'll be logging on just for that, no doubt.

> Skeletons Marching: They're marching, and they are angry!

East common is swarmed again. What few true newbies still exist in the 
game are repeatedly wiped out and quit the game in frustration and tears.
