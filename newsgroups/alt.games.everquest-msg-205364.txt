In all fairness, I don't think Tolkein used phrases like "Hit Points" and
"Armor Class".  The fantasy setting was ripped off from Tolkein, but the
game mechanics that the OP is referring to are not tolkein. 

Now that I think about it, I can't recall any D&D style clerics/paladins
in Tolkein...you have your wizards, rangers, and heroic fighters, but
nothing cleric-esque comes to mind.  Elrond and GAladriel seem more like
wizards that can heal than the prototypical cleric-in-a-tin-can-with-mace.
That image came from...guh, crusades?  King Arthur?
