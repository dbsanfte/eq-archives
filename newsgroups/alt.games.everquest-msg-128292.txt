In HTML.  I Correct this.  Sorry, I've told him NOT to do this anymore...Bad Lenny. 
Here is his post below, in standard format.

  As A player on the evil side let me tell first the belts are a DEATH TRAP give them
in WFP and NFP (bank) guards will
hate you more.  give them to Paly in NFP and the guards in W and E free Port will
Hate you more. 
     What I am going to tell you the path I used to let Lenny Oger so he can go to
the bank in NFP, High Hold, Tree elf city,
High Elf City and allmost Dwarf also the guards will not attack me in Halflign city
By lvl 25 

     First you will need the help of someone (LOTS of it) E&W FP 

       Start in EFP tunnal UNDER EFP Rouge Guild 
       GO to   Harkin Duskfoot, and telll him "What Message" you get a note for Janam 
       Then go to Nestral T`Gaza tell her "who is Rebby" and get a note from her for
Rebby 
       Take both notes to Janam and Rebby both stand across from the "Theater of the
Tranquil" 
       Return stuff you get and repeat repeat repeat 
       raise faction with the Freeport Militia and Corrupt Qeynos Guards allso
freeport Merchants 2 times as fast 
      NO NEG FACTION FROM THIS a win win sell easyer no guards killing you and no one
hates you more 

      NOTE: If you are KOS to the Guards have a frend take the notes to WFP for you
give you the return note and you turn 
      them in it i gave up 3 hours for my oger who the Merchants are WARM to and the
Guards are Dub. 

      North Free Port 
      After the Rebby/Janam you are no longer KOS to Guards in North RO East or West
Comm go and Kill Orcs (Sell the
belts to the ones that do not know better and make some Plat) the camp in West Comm
is allmost allways NOT CAMPED
allso the new camps in Nektulos Forest is allmost not know so allmost never camped.
about 5 or 6 hours killing orcs got Lenny
Oger into NFP By lvl 17 Full run of NW&E Free Port. 

   High Hold Pass First Kill Raiders In North or South Karana kill all them sell the
bronze stuff for 5 or 6 hours you will make
about 160 plat from the bronze and Guards in High Hold will let you pass. (based on
My Oger) the bard in High Keep will not
let you to bank so part 2 is go to Ocean of Tears loc -1000 -7000 kill Gargoyles when
you get a stack of Eyes go con a Bard
should be Dub. now you can go into the bank in High Keep. (allso the eye stack will
sells for 2 or 4 each so sell a stack for a
big price tag 

   Go to Ocean of Tears Loc 500 9000 right out of Butcherblock Mountains kill "Agua
Goblins" this is good with Gnome
Guards, Wood Elf Guards, High Elf Guards and Dwarfs so if ya see Oger in the tree elf
city that would be Lenny the Oger. that
would be me.
