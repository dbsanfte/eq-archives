Oh right.  "This is all some way of them testing us without us knowing, 
because with my l33t technical knowledge (I worked the deep fat fryer at 
McDonald's for seven months once!) I mystically know that patches should 
always go perfectly, and nothing should ever slip through the cracks."  
No conspiracy theories there.  Or typical moronic statements.

> Course god forbid anyone say anything bad about SoE.

God forbid anybody back up their statements.  God forbid we should get 
through one patch without a rant about how much they suck for forcing us 
to give them our credit card numbers and pay month after month without 
ever giving us an option to cancel.  God forbid you should quit and show 
your disapproval of their evil methods.

Which amendment would that be, again?  The right to become delusional at 
the drop of a hat?
