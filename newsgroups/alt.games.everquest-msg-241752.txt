My advice is going to be primarly for your cleric as that is my main.  First
off, as a cleric you (almost)*never* want to pull.  At least to begin with.
Learn your char first,  you want to have Divine Aura memmed at ALL times.
THis spell has saved me numerous times.  When you accidentally pull aggro
and are getting whacked on are about to die, cast this and you have 18
seconds of invulnerability.  Next thing is do NOT chain heal.  You will pull
aggro, just like when someone does too much damage to the mob they pull
aggro, if you heal too much you will pull aggro.  I recommend getting your
heal over time spell as soon as you can.  This spell will help enormously.
Cast that on the PC taking the beatings and watch theri health.  When they
get low cast an actual heal on them to bring them back up in health.  I
always have 4 healing spells memorized.  Superior Healing, Complete Heal,
Celestial Heal, and Word of health.  Now you will usually want a root spell
memmed too, if you do pull aggro cast this on the mob and back away until
your MT can pull the aggro back on himself.  That leaves you with 2 Spell
gems for whatever else you want to use them for.  I typically have something
like stun, and flash of light memorized in them.  Something to help pull
down the AC of the mob or make it hit worse will be greatly appreciated by
your group mates.  But remember the life of the cleric is as follows, *sit,
stand, heal, sit, wait,wait, stand, heal, sit*  YOu will also want to get
your Rez spells ASAP people will greatly appreciate them even when in their
lowbie state.  I mean if you can only get a 15% rez versus none, it's still
15% regained Xp right?  Also you are the lifeblood of a group, especially in
higher lvls, if your group keeps running to the brink of destruction because
they will not let you regain your mana and you are the only healer, don't
feel responsible when they die.  One last thing, a common misconception by
most people is that you want to keep people at 100% health, this is ENTIRELY
wrong  in fact I usually don't start healing my MT until he gets in the 50's
if you try and keeep them at 100% you *WILL* pull aggro, rmember your
HoT(heal over time) spells they are a great friend.  But do not rely on them
completely, here is a link to a flash animation that will show you what
happens if you only use HoT spells.
