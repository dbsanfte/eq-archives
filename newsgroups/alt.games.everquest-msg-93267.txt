Level 54 that is.  Hell, and I'm a Hfl dru too!

Anyway, I don't ask often so I've saved up a few, for any generous enough to
reply.

Thought I was *all that* screaming through the upper 40's into the 50's
right up until I hit 54 - kinda wondering, is it really this bad or worse
from here to 60??  I mean at this rate I'm lucky getting a blue a day where
in 53 I was hitting a goal of 1 yellow a day.  I'd be lucky to hit 60 by the
end of the year it seems heh

Next, Spirit of Eagle appears to be a Luclin drop and a tasty spell at
that - already *bought* =) Form of the Howler and Improved Sup. Camo - but
haven't seen anyone selling SoE.  Anyone know for sure what/where mobs drop
this?  I read somewhere Fungus Grove - never been there so think a trip
there is in my immediate future, but what is the zone like and is there any
soloability in there?

Quad'n or just good single pulling for exp - any ideas at 54?  Guess I don't
have to say just how 'green' the old world is at 54.  Going to login in a
few and head for the Raptor spot in TD - hearing that's not bad quad'n.  I
quad because I really do like to see that little blue etching after killing
something - something that is sorely missing after my kills thus far in 54
=(

Anyway, TIA any help appreciated.

Level 54 Druid on some server somewhere.
