That's not all it shows.  It shows that Ronald Reagan tripled the
national debt in 8 years, despite claiming supply-side economics would
eliminate the deficit by 1982.

I strongly disagree that they're "very well done".  I see bars on
these charts which have no matching color/pattern in the legend.  Many
of the color and pattern choices are downright poor.  In some cases I
see data going so far back that it makes the areas of interest hard to
read because the range is so skewed.

The graph on page 2 is a good example that shows what I've been saying:
Poor fiscal management under Ronald Reagan.  Notice how, under Jimmy
Carter, the deficit spending is noticeably less compared to Ronald
Reagan.  Notice how Bill Clinton reversed the trend year after year.

It's interesting that you pick only those graphics which try to
mislead the reader into thinking republicans have been as fiscally
responsible as democrats for the last 30 years.  The republican party
is the fiscally irresponsible party, plain and simple.

I'll take "tax and spend" over "borrow and spend" any day.  Talk to
anyone who has ever gotten in serious trouble over their credit card
debts about that.  "Borrow and spend" is no way to run a country
long-term.  Sometimes it necessary short-term, but republicans seem to
think it's the only way to run a country.

We'll have to disagree, which doesn't matter much, since it's a
personal opinion.

Hardly meaningless since they came from hand chosen members of Ronald
Reagan's administration.  Even his friends and colleagues discovered
that supply-side economics are voodoo economics.  Even his vice
president agreed.  Even Ronald Reagan's SON campaigns against the same
kind of supply-side economics nonsense George W. Bush is pushing on us
now, to the detriment of everyone but the upper upper class.

It's the rate at which he increased the debt with his nonsense
economic policies, the same policies George W. Bush is using now, not
the fact that he accumulated debt in general.

This is the same load of shit I hear from far too many republicans.
If anything bad happens, and a republican president is in office, it's
the fault of the previous president (if he happens to be a democrat),
or it's the fault of democrats in the congress/senate.

If anything good happens, and a democrat president is in office, it's
because of the previous president (if he happens to be a republican),
or it's because of the republicans in the congress/senate.

It's not entitlement thinking.  That's just nonsense rhetoric from the
republican propaganda machine.  The fact is, workers produce value,
and the elite in America are getting better at exploiting workers
(which explains the continuing widening of the gap between rich and
poor in America).

I don't think much of people who've generated obscene amounts of
wealth through exploitation.  *cough* Wal-Mart *cough*

There's one thing powerful countries typically have in common: A
large, wealthy middle class.  The fact that George W. Bush, and Ronald
Reagan before him, are working so hard to produce a third-world style
class system in America, is beyond me.  It's in the best interests of
the obscenely wealthy to keep the middle class wealthy to keep the
United States powerful (economically).  The fact that they push
ridiculous things like supply-side economics and obscenely huge tax
breaks for the obscenely rich upper upper class is beyond me.  It's
short-sighted and the results aren't good.

It has a very real impact on your life, whether you can see it or not.
The recent tax cuts George W. Bush pushed through are an example:
While most of us got table scraps, the wealthiest 10% in the country
got 90% of the tax cuts.  That money could have gone towards reducing
our deficit so that current and future generations wouldn't have so
much interest debt as before.

Look at the charts you referenced: the interest on the national debt
burden we're all paying is getting worse and worse.

Here's something interesting I saw on Usenet recently:

Q: When is a tax cut not a tax cut?

A: When there's a deficit, stupid!

George W. Bush's recent tax cuts were funded by the United States
borrowing from foreign governments, such as China and Japan.  In
essense, we were forced by our government to take loans from foreign
governments.

The fact that most of the money borrowed goes into the pockets of the
rich is just plain wrong.  What's even worse than that, though, is the
fact that the tax brackets changed, so now we're the suckers that have
to pay back the money the rich got.

1. America borrows money from foreign governments and give it to
obscenely wealthy people

2. America sets things up so the middle class gets to pay the loan
back

3. Profit?  (Not for us...)
