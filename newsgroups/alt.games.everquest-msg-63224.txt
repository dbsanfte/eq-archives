a) How should I realistically pay for a stack of Viscous Mana if I supply the
Pearls and Poison Vials?

b) On Fironia Vie, does a trainer have to teach you the basics of a language or
can you learn them from another player? And...

c) Will trainers (in my case, bard trainers) in other cities teach you other
languages from those in your starting city?

Thanks in advance. :)
