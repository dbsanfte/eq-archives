That's one way of looking at it.  And you do have a good point that by
the time a new player gets to 50, some of these issues may be worked
out.  Maybe...  The counter-argument is that a lot of problems that
have plagued the game since release are STILL problems today
(realm/server population imbalances, class issues, crafting problems,
outright bugs, etc).

So I've got two points that new players should carefully consider:

*  Mythic had a lot of issues to address prior to ToA.  They've got
even more now.  Just because DAoC has been out for a while, don't
expect a clean product with the major issues already worked out.  Do
your research before investing a significant amount of time with a
class (particularly in the end-game).  And definitely research your
realm & server.

*  Also, Mythic has zero qualms about totally changing the rules on
you.  I'm not talking tweaks, I'm talking major overhauls. 
Admittedly, if they nerf a spell line or realm ability, they *usually*
give a respec to allow you to adjust to their changes.  However, they
may wallop your entire class hard (examples--hunter, shadowblades) in
which case you just accept it or start over.  Or they may
retroactively change the stats on items you already have.  The latter
really burned my ass.  I spent a LOT of money updating my gear in
late-Jan that included new artifacts and some neat new items from
their ToA expansion.  Keep in mind this is three months after release.
 Then in Feb they decide that some stats & abilities are too powerful
and overhaul it all *retroactively*.  In this particular case there
was no refunding the player what he paid for his gear.  Nor was there
any attempt to let the player un-SC his existing gear.  Basically
their attitude was "it sux to be you".

We all realize that no MMORPG is perfect.  They are dynamic worlds
within constantly evolving universes.  But while "evolving" might
connote gradual changes, they can be violent upheavals in Mythic's
case.  Just beware what you're getting into.
