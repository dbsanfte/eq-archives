I used to REALLY take it personally when someone would loot and I
didn't hear that familiar *CHA-CHING!* from receiving my share. I
would usually pipe up with something along the lines of "Are we not
auto-splitting the loot?!"

In hindsight, this was due to my inexperience with the game. I now
understand why people often DO NOT auto-split, and I often turn it off
myself, particularly when monks are in the group. Now I just have to
worry about explaining to those as uninformed as I used to be the
reasons behind it.

I think it is just one of those things that does not immediately occur
to most new players. Of course, then you have those who turn
auto-split on to justify them looting everything in sight, feigning
ignorance of the way it truly works.

One word of advice to all tanks: NEVER cross your cleric.  :)
