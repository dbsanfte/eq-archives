1. My vote is "mobile object". At lease that's what I've always
understood it to mean.
2. Killing the same mobs (usually) in one place on a production scale
(as efficiently as possible) without regard to time expense for the
sole purpose of accumulating xp as quickly as possible. Effective, but
not the most fun.
3. I'm gonna pretend you didn't ask that.
