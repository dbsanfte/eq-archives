Oh dear it looks like this might be true. As usual all the changes seem 
to be in the direction of making the game easier, and adding more stuff 
at the demand of the 1% of people in high end guilds.

Hopefully there is a whole lot more too it than this but I fear they've 
exactly missed the point and will destroy the game completely after this.

Hopefully I'm wrong but this doesn't give me a lot of confidence.
