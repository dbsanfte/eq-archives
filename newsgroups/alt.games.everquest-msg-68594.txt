Reinstall the ati drivers now that you have disabled the onboard
video.  

if i remember from my compaq 5030 there was no way to permanetly
disable the onboard video, but it was suppose to recognize the PCI
video card and initalize it first.

so reinstall your drivers, your caught in video upgrade hell and its a
pain in the ass.  also you might want to go back to the onboard video
and change the drivers for that to standard VGA before you do
everything else so that when you boot up with the PCI card in it   you
have hopefully removed the legacy drivers.  

But i would just go ahead and reinstall the radeon drivers, i had
similaar issues with a msi athlon motherboard and this same card.  was
a pain to get working.  but it did work.
