I'm sure with the item bank slots already in place, adding the plat
slot wasn't much of a problem. It was also probably easier than having
to fiddle with merchant code to have specific items with set prices
that override charisma and faction bonuses/penalties... The method you
suggested would not only over complicate things, but it would force
specific denominations.
