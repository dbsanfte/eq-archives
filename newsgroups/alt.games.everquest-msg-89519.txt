I think you're forgetting the fine steel drops. Granted, as a Troll I
had a convenience advantage because I could bank/sell in Ogguk, but I
would keep all the FS for our group in weight reducing containers, and
also keep all the gold (not just plat) and sometimes even *silver* that
dropped. Then, when I was totally overweight, just jog over to Ogguk
with Sow and dump all the weapons on a vendor and change everyone's
silver/gold in for plat at the bank. 750 PP per hour might be a tad high
for our experience there, but three of us often would take home over
1000 plat after a few hours in one session.
