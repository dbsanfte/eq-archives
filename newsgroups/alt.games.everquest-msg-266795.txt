   Wow, Lokari, long time no see!  I have to admit, the AGE seems a little
more empty since you stopped posting here.  But I've heard of this "Having
a life" phenomena you seem to refer to, and I am happy for you for having
one.  Still, if you _want_ to post here more, well, that would be even
better!

    I don't know how big this EQ2 thing is really going to be.  I'm
surprised at the lack of chatter about it here since the game has gone live
(or is there an EQ2 newsgroup now that I somehow missed?).  Maybe the new
really won't cannabalize the old to any great extent.

 Now on EQII, 

Tealeaf Ogre Preist
Teacup Gnome Fighter

Both on AB.
