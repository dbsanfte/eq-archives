ryou (may I call you ryou?)
	I have never said to kill all the afghanistanis right now.  I
have stated at least once if not more that we need to find out exactly
who it is (although I do assume who it is) and then address it from
there.  If a country feels the need to harbor the individual, they
have justified action from our armed forces. 
I personaly do not wan to see nukes dropped... fallout would be
awefull... maybe a nutron (grin just kidding).  I would feel the
action we took in Storm Shield would suffice...
Constant targeting of military targets with sorties(sp?) flying 24x7.
If the "enemy" decides to use its own civilians as a shileld, that
shield should be removed by any means possible.

I can agree with you here... we have not acted on the world wide front
against terrorism.  We havent needed to until now.  Listening to the
Radio and news... big mistake they fluff stuff up and report things
before they are confirmed.

No their pain is not any less.

I dont feel I claim a right to all the pain... just that our pain is
present at the moment and very strong.. its still just the day after.
I try to pride myself as a sorta fence walker... one who "attempts" to
see both sides to a story.

You and me both Ryou.  In fact I did not turn on the TV or news last
evening so my children (2 and 4) would not be bombarded with the
awefull situation.  I hope you and your mom sleep better soon...
may your dreams be full of joy..
