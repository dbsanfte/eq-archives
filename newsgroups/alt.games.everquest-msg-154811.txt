Ah yes, the early days.  I had never played any kind of online game before
and I didn't understand the whole patching thing at all.  When the grey box
kept popping up when I tried running the program I thought something was
wrong.  Then when I finally figured out I needed that stuff it took forever
to download the patch.  Once I finally got in the game I couldn't figure out
how to do anything.  There was no tutorial with my game at all, an I even
remember how excited I was when I figured out how to put the weapon in my
hand.  Then someone saw me do something dumb I guess and called me a "N00B"
and I got so mad I deleted everything and decided not to play.  A few days
later I decided to try it again, and the rest is history.

Keep playing, the game is a lot of fun and you will pick things up very
quickly.  Most people are very helpful to players who are obviously brand
new.

Good Luck
