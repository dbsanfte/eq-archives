   I would have to vote for any class that traditionally is
not thought of as a good soloer.  FV has a reputation for
low population, and many seem to think that it is good to be
able to go it alone if need be.  I would suggest rogue.  I
haven't seen too many of those.  Clerics and warriors seem
to be scarcer than on other servers, as well, but I have
seen others of those classes.  
   For what it's worth, I have seen several beastlords and
shaman.  But many, many more rangers and druids.  I suppose
there are always plenty of both of those on all servers.
