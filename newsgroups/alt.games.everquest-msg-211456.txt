That statement is inaccurate.  More correct would be to say:
"Rangers twinked to an absurd degree can tank nearly as well as
similarly twinked tank classes up to around level 50."
Leave out extreme twinking and the "real" tanks pull away quite
noticeably by the mid 30s due to higher HP and better mitigation.
