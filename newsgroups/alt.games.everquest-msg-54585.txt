...how is someone inspecting you "wasting your time"? It doesn't slow
you down one bit. The only way it could waste your time is if you
CHOOSE to chew them out over it, in which case, it's your own damn
fault your time was wasted and not theirs.

No one has yet given me a valid reason why someone inspecting them
without asking "hurts" them in any way, shape, or form. The "invasion
of privacy" fluff sounds about as bad as people who think cameras at
street intersections that stay pointed at the road invade their
privacy...
