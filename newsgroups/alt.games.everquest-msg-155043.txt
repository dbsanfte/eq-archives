Its all about respect, though, and nothing says Brellpower like beer.  I'd
think it particularly funny if they offered Brell's Blessed Stout, mind
you.

Still, your question is like asking a human why he looks at other women,
when he has a pretty and willing wife at home.  Yes, I have all the free
beer I can ever hope to drink... but there's something to be said for
variety.  If you are a halfling, think of it in terms of pie.  Other races
will have to come up with their own examples.
