Right.  And even that could be done two ways:

1.  Dump the whole 3p/2g/3s remainder on a random
    group member.

2.  Pick a random group member.  Give him 1p.
    Pick a random group member again.  Give him 1p.
    Pick a random group member again.  Give him 1p.
    Pick a random group member again.  Give him 1g.
    Pick a random group member again.  Give him 1g.
    Pick a random group member again.  Give him 1s.
    Pick a random group member again.  Give him 1s.
    Pick a random group member again.  Give him 1s.

Either way, loot would tend to average out for
each group member over time, even if one designated
looter always did the looting.  However, method #2
would make for better "even" distribution even over
the short term.

Finally, if the game wanted to be *really* smart,
it could do what the players would logically do
if they wanted to take the time:  Treat the
coins as 3.842p, then divide it rationally:

   3.842 divided six ways is 0.640 and change.
   Give player #1, 1p from the loot, and have
   him pitch 3g, 6s from his current coin
   stash into the "pot" as "change".
   Etc. for each additional group member.

This is similar to what people do when they're
all trying to pay a split restaurant bill in
cash -- "Ok, everyone needs to pitch in $12,
um, can anyone break this five?"  "All I have
is a twenty, I'm going to toss that in the pot
and take $8 back out."

It would be a pain in the butt for everyone to
do this manually at every loot, but a piece of
cake for the computers running EQ.  This is
the sort of grubby computation that computers
were built to relieve us of.
