<text cut>

Actually sounds like what happened in an article I read in PCZONE (UK PC
Games Mag).
I believe that the regulars may be familiar with the author, as he came to
the newsgroup with some dumb questions and an attitude.

Which also carried through into some of the poorest quality pieces on
computer gaming I have read. The guy did not have a clue, and though  I wish
no-one any harm, I do hope that he swiftly found employment in a field he
understood/enjoyed.
