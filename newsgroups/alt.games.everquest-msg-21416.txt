I think you'll agree that WHAT they say depends on the group.  There's a 59
monk I occasionally hunt with (really nice guy) that pulls as soon as he
hears the word "mana," either as a word or part of an abbreviation...and it
doesn't matter if that "M" is part of "FM," "LOM," or even "OOM."  If you
don't want him to pull, you have to say "SIT DOWN!  DON'T PULL!" <g>  If he
asks why not, for god's sake don't say "'cause I have no mana," or he'll be
pulling before you get the "ana" out.

In most groups I've found that you have to lie about your mana status.
DEFINITELY after each fight announce your mana number...just in most groups
you have to lie and say it's 20 - 40% less than it actually is to keep the
overzealous pullers from getting too excited.
