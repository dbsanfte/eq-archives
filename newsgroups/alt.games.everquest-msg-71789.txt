Rapidly it is becoming clear to me that a solo beastlord needs his pet
to be primary sponge.  Beastlord pet aggro is sufficient to allow me to
back off from a fight at will, which is good... but I can't seem to get
them off me and onto him if we are both in the fight.  This means only
one tank is swinging away at the target for a significant
portion of each battle.

I thought that Spirit of Lighting was going to increase his taunt level
for me, but so far no go.

Given the incredible pet based healing power at my command, its quite
possible for me to sit down and just watch the pet solo yellow mobs with
me as healer and helping chase down runners... but thats not what I
thought the class was all about.

I find it costs me more mana to go in and double team the mob than to
just let the pet do the heavy lifting, though, healing myself up after
the fight (even after bandaging to half first) costs far more than the
mana I use keeping the pet up and running alone.
Dual Weild is only 28 so far, maybe when thats up over 100 my damage
output will
get up there to a more serious level... or maybe my melee output should
only be used when in a group.
