Heh : )  She doesn't kite, barely ever solos, and is one of the best players
I know.

For the most part we've been trying to do the trials with as much of our
"regular" group as it will allow.   No point in one of us going to PoV
without the others getting through.   LFG'ing sucks.  Hard.

> What kind of group make-up have you been using for the execution trial?

62 Warrior (me) 62 Rogue, 61 Rogue (ding'ed 62 last night), 62 Enchanter
(ding'ed 63 last night), 62 druid, 61 cleric.

All are passably well equipped, but not extremely.  Epic weapons for the
most part, and Halls of Testing armor.

Well, one of our first moves was to buy everyone a horse : P  Even those
that swore they would never use one.   The medding while standing was just
too important to us getting past the trial.

When the mobs pop, we start moving.  If there is a rock mob (unmezzable) I
get on that and kill it first.   If there are two, the druid uses Banishment
on one while I tank the other. (Banishment has a huge recharge time). The
enchanter mezes all of the phlarg beasts.  The druid may need to help keep
the enchanter and cleric alive during the initial spawn, but then goes full
out nuking.

Works pretty well up until the final boss.   The druid is out of mana at the
end of the 4'th round, but the cleric can have varrying amounts.  (the only
time she was well above half was the time it got bugged so the 4'th mob
didn't spawn on the last wave).

When the executioner spawns, we need to kite him while the cleric and druid
get some mana.  So far we haven't had much luck with it (he will switch to
the cleric instead of following me on a merry chase around the stage), but
it seems to be key to getting us past the trial.  (Or was until they fixed
slow).   Then the enchanter slows him and we work on killing him.

It's do-able, even without slow working right... we were so damn close a few
of the times.  But it was a major pain in the ass.   The worst part is the
wait in between attempts.   You can't get any kind of a rhythm going when
you have to take a half hour to hour break in between each attempt, while 6
other groups go. (assuming none of them wins, which extends the wait an
extra half hour)

Then we need to modify our group / tactics a bit to get our shaman and
paladin past it.

We haven't been having shaman buffs for it, and without those I top out
around 6000, maybe a little less..   6780 fully buffed these days, soon to
rise. (close to 63)
