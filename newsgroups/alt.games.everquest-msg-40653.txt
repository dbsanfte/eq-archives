    Richard, at some point the zone will be nearly clear of players -
everyone will be inside, or it's 3 am PST. The next person to zone in, or
the one or two people left at zone, are in for one heck of a shock. This
isn't like Seb - those first two zone spawns can stay up as long as they
want, and nobody ever dies from it. If you're the first person into the zone
in at Howling Stones, though, and you have the wrong type of Invis up, you
are in trouble.

    If you think I'm wrong, try an experiment. Wait until there's only a few
folks at zone in Sebilis (again, 3 am PST is a good time), then train the
front two spawns up to the zone-in and Gate. Before you're petitioned, come
back in and see how many dead folks are there. Last time I saw that done, of
a crowd of five people milling around three had died (one was AFK) before an
enchanter happened to zone in and get things under control.

    James
