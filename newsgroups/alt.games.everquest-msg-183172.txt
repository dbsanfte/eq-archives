There is a portal for PoK near Shar Vahl, it's just not in the city 
itself. It's outside in Shadeweaver's Thicket. As you enter Shadeweaver's 
(exit the south gate of Shar Vahl) go to the left near the wall and a 
little ways past the tents you will see a few big rocks with the PoK 
portal book in front of them.
