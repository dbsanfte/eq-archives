Just finished an adventure with 57 Magician, 56 Paladin (me),
56 Enchanter, 55 Rogue, 53 Rogue, 52 Cleric.  It turned out to be
pretty much a cakewalk.  Once I talked the Mage into switching from
earth pet to air the Cleric had only me to heal.  The Enchanter did
not slow more than one or two mobs so the Mage's DS on me probably
did more damage than my attacks.  We had only one small (3 mob)
train, which was my fault as I got distracted and didn't get the
runner stunned fast enough.  Completed the mission (a Rescue) in
62 minutes, including a short bio break in the middle of it.
