You completely missed the point!

He's referring to the fact that if you have 4 50th level characters, 
each representing several thousand hours plan, and he wants to try 
something new he has delete one of them. If after 2 hours of fooling 
around with the new one he decides he wants to play one of his original 
4 he has to start rebuilding him from scratch!

Unless, GASP, you want FIVE characters?

Hell, I have a number of groups of RL friends, with some overlap (e.g. 
theres a regular group of 4 that I group with, and I also duo with one 
of the guys fairly regularly...so we have a character we play when all 4 
are on, and a character I play when its just the 2 of us.)

That eats all 4 characters right there, I can't even have a 'solo' 
character for hooking up with pickup groups, or guild groups, or 
whatever when any of my 'regular groups' aren't on.

This is hardly a case of 'leaving alts all over the place'.

> there's a "cost" associated with abandoning a character.

Is the reason 'cost' is in quotes because the number is so low its 
virtually a token.

Lets go ahead and put a real number on that. It won't crack 25 cents per 
year. Raise everyone's subscription 25 cents per month and they'd still 
be making extra money even after giving us two dozen more slots.

And I delete characters I have no interest in playing again too. But I 
keep the ones I want to play again. And its more than 4.

Depends on how one enjoys the game. I bought DiabloII played 4 
sorcerouses, 3 necromancers, at least 5 different barbarians, and 3 
different amazons before I even got a feel for what I liked, including a 
couple gimp templates. I got them all to 50+ level before settling on 
one barbarian, 2 sorcerouses, one amazon, and a necromancer, I later 
added a paladin to the mix too.

In EQ2 I don't even have enough slots to play the characters I settled 
on, nevermind the 'abandoned alts'.

In EQ2 I'd have had to *delete* several of characters I'd ultimately 
settled on before I'd know whether or not I wanted to settle on them 
them. Its ridiculous that I should have to level a character to 30+ 
where they start to differentiate, then delete them to find out if I'd 
like a different path more, and if perchance I find that I liked my 
original path... I must start from scratch a 3rd time, and re-do 
everything I'd already done.

And EQ2 has far more stuff to try than DiabloII so the limit is even 
more constrictive.

To effectively lock a player out of trying a new character class without 
forking out *large* amounts of money is ridiculous. (And YES having to 
delete a character worth thousands of hours of play time is an effective 
lock out. The player would have to be -sick- of him to want to delete 
him... if he still enjoyed playing him he'd be S-O-L.

If this was honestly a question of 'hard drive storage space' I'd be 
sympathetic to SOE, and in all honesty I'd be willing to cover the cost 
of the extra hard drive space I'm using. But that isn't the case.

They're effectively charging us several extra dollars per month for 
storage space measured in kilobytes...at a time I can get gigabytes for 
pennies a million other places: something is wrong here.

They've obviously figured they will make more money from the fanatics 
who will buy 2 or more accounts to make alts then they will lose to 
people who won't buy the game at all. The actual cost of the slots is 
not even a relevant concern!

Good on them. If they are right they'll have squeezed a few extra bucks 
from the franchise. I hope for your sake, they don't get you hooked on 
your character, and then jack the price up. (Oh wait... they did that 
with EQ1 too... a 30% price increase to cover 'increasing costs'. 
Increasing costs? To the tune of 30%? In an era of rapidly falling 
hardware prices, rapidly falling bandwidth costs, reduced in game 
support, and stagnant wages? It was a bald faced LIE.

I predict you'll be paying 19.95 a month soon enough. They might bundle 
some 'costless' extras to make it easier to swallow... you know... like 
extra character slots. (And best of all, those suckers who are currently 
paying for mutliple accounts to get the extra slots now are doubly 
screwed, unless of course they pay a years worth of subscription fees to 
move the characters of course.
