The Valor Guardian's are the weakest (in terms of mitigating player DPS) of
the mobs in Honour, the damage output of the group dropped on Armour
mobs (Guardian's of Marr, and Valiant Spirits)

No VoG or SoV, no enchanter around, just a Shaman, and Archery caps at 240
skill.

Best arrows in the game at the moment (Tunare only though), and yes the bow was
dated, but I was holding out on a new bow for a long time, compounded with bad luck
on bow drops (Seru, and Vex Thal). Even though it is a dated bow, a +100 pure
attack buff is an immense boon to DPS.

To clarifiy things a bit, my results were skewed in my favor as in we ignored results
from walled mobs (0 DPS for the fight from archery).  , but the group was pretty
good about not walling mobs for the most part.  Rogue damage is far and away
more consitent then Ranger archery damage.  The parses per fight would look
something like this:

                Ranger:        Rogue:
Fight 1        220              197
Fight 2        120              200
Fight 3        144              192
Fight 4        175              189
Fight 5        132              212
Fight 6        0 (walled)    184

It's not uncommon to see the following during a run of Trueshot:

Target is hit for 1500 (critical) non-melee damage
Target is hit for 128 non-melee damage
Target is hit for  77  non-melee damage
Target is hit for  1375 (critical) non-melee damage
Target is hit for  212 (critical) non-melee damage

/Gu Uhhhhh guild, don't push the mob into the wall please.

Mob goes in the wall, wasted Trueshot, break out the melee.

She, the Rogue in the parses, also hasn't spent 48 aa on a form of damage
that is entirely negated by zone geometery.  Which means in NToV archery
is great (rooted mobs make me smile), Luclin you can bank your bow for all
the damage it will do, works great on Seru, the rooted blob in Vex Thal, and
passable on the Cursed since it keeps you out of the AE.  Archery is very
good in PoP though.

As well for comparision, I did several fights using a Blessed Faydark Thunderbolt.
30/38 (no Avatar up either) on average it pulled in about 140 DPS.

She has no primal, no other item haste aside from the Rage Bringer, and the
+50 raw attack the Rage Bringer provides still makes it an amazing offhand weapon
3 years after it was introduced.  Rangers still use Swiftwind for the same reasons.
