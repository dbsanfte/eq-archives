Ah, well, I left out some key information here...I just started playing EQ
again after taking a 6 month or so break, and I only own the original EQ at
the moment...so, no velious.....and for some reason, my monitor seems to
take a good 2-3 seconds to switch video modes.....So looting, banking,
trading, right clicking anything, shopping, spellbook, etc etc, switches
back to window-mode....ie at least 2 video mode changes doing
ANYTHING.....gets annoying real quick....And if I remember correctly, with
Velious, most all of this is fixed except for opening the spellbook....

But, I still think the GUI is cumbersome over all....Personally, I like
Anarchy Online's GUI, to me it was so much better then EQ, AC, and DAoC
GUIs...except for not being able to flip the right-left mouse click
thing....right clicking everything gets confusing......LOL...especially when
you jump back into EQ and right click a spell and instead of casting it
un-mems....hehe....
