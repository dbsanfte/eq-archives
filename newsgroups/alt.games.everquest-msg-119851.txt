That is a very good point, but think about it. A person paying too
much likely is being generous. People don't typically overpay without
asking questions, and if questions ARE asked, then they will know what
is expected if they didn't already. The porter can either humbly
accept the "tip", ensuring the portee understands it was overpayment,
and buff the portee to the greatest extent possible or suggest that
the going rate is far less than offered. This can also be done by
accepting the payment and stating, "Wow! Thanks! That was very
generous." This gives the portee an opportunity to double-check the
going rate with the porter.

Both of my above suggestions leave the druid having done what is
right. To knowingly deceive by paying less, especially after the port,
is *not* the right thing to do. Look at it this way - if there is
*any* deceit involved (the porter not knowing you only intend to offer
5gp or saying you are broke when you, in fact, are not) then you are
being dishonest.

I'm not suggesting there be an established rule for this crap, but
come on, people, deceit = dishonesty = you're wrong. It's kindergarten
ethics.
