I'm already bracing against the first Nexus Scion raid.  And the inevitable
Uberbitching that will ensue when she drops nothing but a few of those neat
little stones.  But it is nice to know she can handle herself nicely if it
ever comes to something like that.  Nothing against your experiment, though.
Some guy did it on Povar a little while ago, and I don't think it was
intentional in that case.  I'm also pretty sure he wasn't a level 1 char.
The scion treated him like one all the same though.
