Have you ever walked away from EQ for a while? And if so, how did that
go for you and how was it coming back later on?

I came to the conclusion last night that I need to take the advice I've
seen given to so many others, and "put down the mouse and step <away>
from the computer!"  And no, this is not another of the tired old
"Verant SuXX0rs! I fucking quit! DAoC R00lz!" posts. I'm not deleting my
characters, or even cancelling my account, nor going to a new game. I
just need to do ....... something else .......... for a while.

I've realized that I've gotten totally addicted to this game to the
point where it's impacting my life, and I don't like that feeling. I've
realized that I have finished reading *one* book this year, except when
I was on vacation camping when I read *five* in one and a half weeks.
I've basically stopped reading. :-(
  My wife and I have been to a total of *one* movie, and *one* play
since we started seriously playing early this year. I used to enjoy
watching several shows on television. I would go into work the next day,
and my friends and colleagues would discuss these shows. Now I'm not
even sure if they are still on the air, and my friends have given up
asking me if I saw them. ("uhh... no, I was ...... errr..... busy.") We
hardly ever go out to dinner any more, nor even cook any really big
elaborate meals at home. Delivery chinese food and pizza has apparently
become easily 25% of my diet.
  We've gotten to the point where, basically, I go to work, come home,
and play EQ and go to sleep. It's sad. I seem to remember this place
outside my house. I think it was called "outdoors". And there were other
people there. Real ones, not just animations. I seem to vaguely remember
talking to them and interacting with them. I believe they are called
"neighbors".
  Anyway, I thought I would share that and ask if anybody else has gone
through the same thing. I'm going to log on tonight to inform my closest
friends and regular hunting partners, and make good on a
promise/commitment I already made to help somebody in Norrath today.
Then I think I'm going to shut down the computer and go to the local
bookstore. Hell, I might even take in a movie. And I'll come back when
I'm feeling a little more "normal" again. Maybe when SoL comes out. I
know I'll need to find new hunting partners when I come back, as my
friends will likely all be 55+, in uberguilds, and hunting in ToV and
Sleepers by then, but that's ok. I'm sure lots more folks will make it
up into the fifty range by then. Never know who you'll meet.
