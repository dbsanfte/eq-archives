You have to buy a boxed game to be able to play. Your best bet *by far* is
to buy a copy of EverQuest Gold, which contains the original EverQuest
Classic, and ALL of the expansion packs, plus a few other goodies (cloth
maps, pewter figurine, nice manual, etc.) all packaged up in a cool gold box
container. It can be found for about $49. When you consider that you would
spend at least $29 for each of the expansions, that's a decent deal. Also,
that will give you a code key that will enable all expansions, and it will
have much of the latest patches on it to reduce the patch time when you
first connect. Buy EQ Gold and save yourself and money, time and trouble.
