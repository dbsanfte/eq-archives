I guess you can support them if you want .  I've already deleted my 3
charaters. So there's your answer.
Yeah I guess I'm mad , and I have a good reason to be, considering I
was 5 blocks away on Liberty St. last year. If you saw it on TV you
have no idea, none, of what it was like.I started playing EQ last June
since I had nothing to do for the summer and my friend had just
started playing  I thought I'd give it a try.
After 9/11 I was pretty fucked emotionally, 2 friends dead. And I was
really touched to tears when I logged on one night and saw everyone
holding a torch. 
Go to Verant's  web site, Not a fucking word about it there either.
You can keep playing , I don't care. But do those that care a favor
and at least email Verant and ask them whats up. I've already emailed
a few EQ friends and they were way ahead of me.

We Will Not Forget...
