I don't understand. I can eat a pizza and feel OK, so does it follow 
that I can eat 40 pizzas and feel OK? Asking your little brother to get 
you something in game under the promise of a RL reward does not risk 
unbalancing the game, while massive plat trading most certainly does. 
And yes, the only significant difference is *precisely* scale. Scale *is* 
what makes it not being "ok".

Well, whether it's legal or not in the real world is not the issue. 
Speaking on your cellphone is legal, but they can still kick you out of 
a movie theater for it. Sony can kick you out of EQ for any reason they 
want.
