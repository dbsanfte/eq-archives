SRo Jboots isn't a camp, its a KS fest, and no better than a
hope.  AC JBoots is an actual camp, widely respected, decent
exp pulling seafuries in between pops.  Its still far more time
than I'm willing to put in.  TBoots ARE a better idea.

Sadly, they are almost useless for emergencies, as they have a
cast time long enough that its quite possible for mobs (particularly
multiple mobs) to interrupt your drinking them.  Like TBoots, they
are useful when you keep them "always on," not so much when you
wait till you need them.  JBoots, on the other hand, are instant cast,
which means you can do them on the fly and never get interrupted.

There is a wide range between blue cons.  I find it difficult to
understand why you would be having this experience, though.
As a cleric soloing, I use root and DD tactics, and have to med
back most of my mana between kills.  The only thing I have that
is better than what you have is a means of controlling adds, and
if you are single pulling, you don't have to do that (nor do I, I
avoid adds like the plague).  On the other hand, your "root" is
a pet that is doing significant damage, and your DD spells are
more mana efficient than mine, not to mention the fact that you've
almost certainly specialized in one of your damage lines, while
I'm specialized in alteration (heals) and you should be using focus
items to reduce your operating costs still further, while they didn't
exist when I was low enough to use the "up to 44" ones and I
can't afford the level III ones.    Seems to me you'd spend at
best half as much mana per kill as I did!  Perhaps you need
to pick on lower level blues?
