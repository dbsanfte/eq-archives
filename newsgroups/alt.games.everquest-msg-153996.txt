Level 48, and I still deal almost daily with people who have *no* idea
at all about positioning.  And these are people higher-level than me,
and in guilds.  These are people I've seen in groups many times
before.

It's so annoying to plead with people attempting to desperately get
all the tanks on one side of the bloody mob so the Rogue(s) can have a
chance to get a reliable BS in.  And I'm not even the Rogue; I'm the
(mostly soloing) Paladin.
