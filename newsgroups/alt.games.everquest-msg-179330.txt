Whenever I type /BAZAAR (while I'm in the Bazaar, of course), I get
the "introductory" message (about right clicking and such), but I
never see the Bazaar window.  It's like it's off-screen or something.

Has anyone else seen this behavior and, more importantly, what can
be done (if anything) to fix it.
