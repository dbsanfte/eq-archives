Legally, you have to have a copy of the game for each computer you want to
put it on if you are going to play them at the same time, but you can use
the same everquest CD to install the game on each computer, and then create
4 accounts, again, legally, you have to have 4 copies.  To install Luclin
you do not have to have either of the other two expansion (Kunark or
Velious), just the original.  You can have as many accounts as you want, and
since all account information is stored on the everquest servers you can log
onto your account(s) from any other computer with the game installed on it.
Hope that answers your questions.
