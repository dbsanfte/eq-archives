It does depend on your swimming skill.  My main's swimming is 200.  He has
no trouble popping in and out of the water there.

I jumped in with one of my alts to get some practice, and found that I was
unable to jump out.  Finally logged on my wife's druid to port me out.

I think 100 skill will let you shoot out of the water, since Iksars start
at 100, and can do that at level 1.
