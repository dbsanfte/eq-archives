Just about all mobs come in a range of levels. I would guess that in the
case of the Adherent and the Recruit you refer to, their levels must
overlap. For example, a recruit may spawn between levels 18 and 22, and an
Adherent between 20 and 24 (all numbers made up.) So you might have had a 22
Recruit spawn, and then a 20 Adherent.

Also, as far as I know, the amount and or level of buffs you have has
absolutely no effect on how a mob will con to you. A passing 55 shaman
buffed my lvl 9 cleric up to close to 500 hp, a druid had given me regen and
a 24 pt damage shield, and I had a clarity and SoW, yet a skeletal pawn at
the chessboard in BB still conned yellow. With all of those buffs I finished
the fight with full bars of hp and mana. Were those buffs taken into account
when determining the con of that pawn, he would've been as green as they
come.
