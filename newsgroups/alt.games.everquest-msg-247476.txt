Well, I have been unemployed scum for a year and an half now, and it was 
straining the budget back when I was working just to get a used 
jetta....and the cost of a prius/equivalent hybrid was way out of range, 
see husband was career navy and the pay for E6 over 18 years sucks 
monkey dick. Especially in a state like Connecticut that has a seriously 
high cost of living=(. Even with me working, squeezing out the $275 for 
the jett was putting a bit of a strain on things, and we had just had to 
do infrastructure work on the house, water heater/furnace crapped out, 
pump and heating system/plumbing needed replacing, electrical system for 
the house needed to be brought up to code so we could use the microwave 
and the lights in the kitchen at the same time... his car had died so we 
were getting 2 vehicles at the same time, so the money just was not there=(

Plus there is the problem that I categorically REFUSE to ever again 
drive a car that has a PIECE OF SHIT AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION. Did I 
mention that I HATE AUTOMATICS? I think that after 30 years and over a 
million miles of driving, I *think* I know when to shift...=)
