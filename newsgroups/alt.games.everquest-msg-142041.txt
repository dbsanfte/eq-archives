    Yup. The theory was sound for low blues versus characters with good
gear - the mobs can't hit you hard, you kill them fast, and because of your
level you single pull them. It breaks down in other situations where the XP
is also good, like Cazic Thule, but as a blueprint for pure XP with a
minimum of people it's sound. Especially in places like Fungus Grove.
