I predict that you will need to have a drink of some fluid within the next
72 Hours.  I also predict that you will cough sometime in the next 72 hours.
I know this to be true, unless you die before that (which is always a
possibilty, though something I cannot forsee well).  I can say with great
certainty that both of these are accurate predictions of the future.  Does
that make me a fraud, also?  Or does that mean I am just predicting
something that is a rather obvious truth?
