this is a lame logic to me....  I have grouped with some awful
cleric's, monks, wizards, necros, bards, mages, druids, shamans,
shadow knights, ... hmm you get the picture..
and I still group with those classes...  as I'm sure you have as well.
did that one or more bad experience taint you?

hell, next you will say I met this white/black/asian/hispanic  who was
a jerk... Ill never talk to or trust a white/black/asian/hispanic
again.... 

just something to think about...

I for one group with anyone and everyone until they have proven
themselves useless/a fool/ jerk/ etc
