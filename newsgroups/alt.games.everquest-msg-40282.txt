People are always asking about "what class should I play?" or "who solos
best?" and all sorts of who-is-better class questions. Here, at long last
(I've been thinking about making this for many months now, just never got
around to it), is the breakdown of each class and their ability to perform
each of the important aspects of EQ. I've broken it down into a list of 24
different aspects which classes may possess. Note, that just because a
class *can* do something well, doesn't mean it is smart for them to (ie:
the int caster classes and their general good ability to taunt stuff,
despite their frailty)...the inteligence of doing something is not
reflected in the rating.

Bear in mind that I am not omniscient, and this is a work in progress. I
don't play all classes, so a given class may have a better (or worse)
rating than I give it, simply because there is some aspect of the class I'm
not totally familiar with. Also, if anyone can think of any more good
categories to add (I'm sure I've missed a couple), by all means lemme know.
Just please don't send a faction recommendation, because there are too many
factors beyond class that affect this.

Ratings are 0-10, 0 means the class doesn't have that ability AT ALL, 1
means it is only available through exceptional means such as a weapon proc
or armor-right-click. Classes are assumed to be 60th level, for the sake of
having complete skillsets, and because most folks are primarily interested
in the high end game. Coming up with a seperate ranking for every 5 levels
is beyond what I have any desire to do. Unless there is a really good
reason for it (like the shaman snare category), there is no reference to
different races within a class. Simple explanations will be given as to the
rationale behind the rating, for most of them.

The Categories Are:
1) Damage Absorb - A combination of hitpoints and AC, this is the ability
to "tank"
2) Taunt - The ability to grab a mob off someone else
3) Damage Avoid - The ability to get a mob off yourself
4) Pet - Have one? How good is it?
5) Root - Obvious
6) Snare - Ditto
7) Travel - Running speed and Teleports. If the rating is "1", then the
only method the class has to decrease travel time is begging/jboots. 2
means begging/jboots, or the Gate spell
8) Melee Damage - Doesn't really need explaining
9) Spell Damage - Nukes and DoTs
10)Healing - Regeneration spells included
11)Buffing - Doesn't count self-only buffs
12)Mob Debuffing - Includes instant debuffs, like stun
13)Crowd Control - Any method of managing a pull of more than 1
14)Downtime Reduction - Killing things faster is not (for my purposes
here), downtime reduction
15)Tracking - Self-explanatory
16)Hostile Territory Travel - The ability to move through areas filled with
KOS mobs, SoW is not a factor in this rating
17)Corpse Recovery - How well the class can do it
18)When-The-Shit-Hits-The-Fan - Ability for the class to self-preserve/save
group in a no-win-situation
19)Pulling - Ability to grab stuff (peeling off singles out of fully
spawned areas, etc)
20)Group Desirability - How much the class is wanted...not a reflection of
how good the class is, cause people have funny ideas about what some
classes can/cannot do.
21)Solo ability - If at first you cannot group...how well can you go alone.
22)Resurrection - Duh
23)Epic Difficulty - Some are harder to get than others
24)Epic Power - Some of the right clicks/procs are a hell of a lot more
useful than others

ENCHANTER:
Damage Absorb: 3, enchanters are fragile as hell
Taunt: 7, tash and stuns taunt like hell
Damage Avoid: 8, mem blur and stuns
Pet: 6 Normal pet is strong but stupid...charming gives an edge, sometimes
a huge one
Root: 7
Snare: 0
Travel: 2
Melee Damage: 2
Spell Damage: 4 enchanters are piss-poor nukers/DoTers
Healing: 0
Buffing: 8, haste, runes
Mob Debuffing: 8, slows, tash, stuns
Crowd Control: 10, nobody does it better
Downtime Reduction: 9, crack, crack, and more crack
Tracking: 0
Hostile Territory Travel: 7, illusions, plus both regular invis and IVU
Corpse Recovery: 3
When-The-Shit-Hits-The-Fan: 3, AE stuns or a well timed charm can sometimes
save a group, but don't hold your breath
Pulling: 2
Group Desirability: 10...most people don't kill ANYTHING without an
enchanter
Solo ability: 6 Good enchanters can solo well...but not enough players are
good enough
Resurrection: 0 
Epic Difficulty: 5, pretty middle-of-the-road, no really difficult fights,
and people tend to go out of their way to suck up to enchanters by helping
them out.
Epic Power: 8, shissar is the best haste in the game, and haste is huge.

WIZARD:
Damage Absorb: 3, no better than enchanters
Taunt: 7, over-nuking wizards tend to get killed a lot
Damage Avoid: 6, brain bite, some ability to stun
Pet: 2, wizard pet is a joke
Root: 7
Snare: 8
Travel: 10, no spirit of wolf, but the ability to hit the planes, and the
new translocates let wizards edge out druids.
Melee Damage: 1
Spell Damage: 10, best in the game.
Healing: 0
Buffing: 2, wizard damage shields rather suck, but they exist
Mob Debuffing: 5, stuns
Crowd Control: 4, Root, and snare-kiting is about it...their ac/hp don't
allow for much
Downtime Reduction: 3, mana harvest is ok, but gets pointless at high
levels
Tracking: 0
Hostile Territory Travel: 5, invis and IVU
Corpse Recovery: 1
When-The-Shit-Hits-The-Fan: 9, evac, evac, evac
Pulling: 4 nukes pull well, but ac/hp tend to kill the wizard before
reaching the group
Group Desirability: 5
Solo ability: 8 wizards can quad kite raptors with the best of them
Resurrection: 0 
Epic Difficulty: 3 a tough one, but easier than it was...getting some of
the rare drops (from phinny in particular) can be a bitch. Racial note:
Dark elf wizards are really hosed because of their KOS status in Halas.
Epic Power: 6, Not a fabulous effect, but combine it with a manna robe (or
better, a manastone), and wizards can greatly increase their mana regen.

MAGICIAN:
Damage Absorb: 3...this is an int caster after all
Taunt: 5, low nuking power
Damage Avoid: 6, pets do the tanking
Pet: 8, strong pets with a lot of variety in their usefulness, lose points
because the material component must be bought (instead of looted like with
necros). Epic mages boost this rating to 10, because the epic pet is
mind-numbingly powerful.
Root: 1, only available through the earth pet
Snare: 0
Travel: 6, Call of the Hero is counted here, otherwise this would be a 2.
Melee Damage: 2
Spell Damage: 6, reasonable nukes, but tend to get resisted a lot
Healing: 3, pet only
Buffing: 6, strong damage shields, good pet buffs
Mob Debuffing: 6, the malX line is a good one
Crowd Control: 3 only doable through the pet
Downtime Reduction: 3, can summon bandages and such which can help
Tracking: 0 
Hostile Territory Travel: 6, Call of the Hero again, otherwise having just
invis drops them to a 4
Corpse Recovery: 2
When-The-Shit-Hits-The-Fan: 4...they can gate
Pulling: 1...pets really fuck up pulling.
Group Desirability: 6, epic mages go to 8
Solo ability: 5, epic mages go to 8
Resurrection: 0 
Epic Difficulty: 2, a real bitch...no really huge fights, but some of the
required camps (ie: quillmane) are the closest thing to hell-on-earth that
you can get.
Epic Power: 7, pet pathing reduces this rating...if pathing was better, the
power of the pet would jump this to 9

NECROMANCER:
Damage Absorb: 3...robe, robe, robe
Taunt: 7, DoTs are big-time taunts, and necros have a lot of them
Damage Avoid: 8, like the magician, but they also have Fear
Pet: 9, very strong pets with useful special abilities (and cool
appearances, especially the 59 one), and the ability to get the material
component in the field
Root: 4
Snare: 6
Travel: 2
Melee Damage: 2
Spell Damage: 7, lots of DoT power
Healing: 3, meager at best...but I've heard of groups using a necro as
their primary healer :)
Buffing: 0
Mob Debuffing: 6, fear is a beauty
Crowd Control: 6, many people underestimate a necro's ability to mez, their
pet can also take an add out of the fight for a while
Downtime Reduction: 5, great self-only mana regen, and can twitch mana onto
others as needed
Tracking: 0
Hostile Territory Travel: 6, invis, IVU, and feign death
Corpse Recovery: 8, would be a 10, but coffins are expensive as hell, and
you need the person to be in the zone to summon their body
When-The-Shit-Hits-The-Fan: 5, gate and feign death
Pulling: 1, same as magician
Group Desirability: 3...despite all the things they can do, people really
crap on necros for grouping
Solo ability: 10...a strong suit.
Resurrection: 5...yes, they can do a very high value ressurection, but the
essence emerald requirement shoots this rating in the ass.
Epic Difficulty: 3, the PoA requirement is a bad one, even with the drop
being made more common. Requires a couple of raid-level fights.
Epic Power: 3...another snare and dot for necros? *yawn*
Special Category: Epic Appearance: 1...the duck stick is an abomination
against nature

CLERIC:
Damage Absorb: 5, good AC, but low defensive skills, and cruddy hp
Taunt: 6, heals can be used to taunt, and stuns make for good taunts
Damage Avoid: 4, stun and root
Pet: 1...a joke
Root: 6
Snare: 1, innoruuk worshipping clerics can get the snare necklace
Travel: 2
Melee Damage: 3
Spell Damage: 4, 6 against undead
Healing: 10...obviously
Buffing: 8, tons of useful buffs, from symbols to AC to HP to resists
Mob Debuffing: 5, stun only
Crowd Control: 3, root only
Downtime Reduction: 0...meditating for more heals doesn't count
Tracking: 0 
Hostile Territory Travel: 3, IVU is only very limited in its usefulness
Corpse Recovery: 3
When-The-Shit-Hits-The-Fan: 5...the divine aura spells, or a well timed
complete heal can save lives
Pulling: 4
Group Desirability: 10, like the enchanter, most people believe that you
cannot be in the same zone as a hostile mob without a cleric
Solo ability: 2, 4 against undead
Resurrection: 10, the master
Epic Difficulty: 7, this would be a 10 if not for the hell of the ragefire
camp...people bend over backwards to help clerics get their sprinklers.
Epic Power: 10...most useful epic in the game.

DRUID:
Damage Absorb: 4, being limited to leather makes druids into punching bags
Taunt: 6, heals, nukes, and dots
Damage Avoid: 5 root and snare/sow kiting are the only options
Pet: 2, slightly better than a cleric/wizard pet, but that isn't a
compliment
Root: 7
Snare: 9
Travel: 9, SoW and a huge number of portal locations
Melee Damage: 3
Spell Damage: 7, good nukes, good dots
Healing: 7, the level 60 druid heal is quite good, pack chloroplast is huge
Buffing: 7, damage shields, wolf form, and some small stat buffs
Mob Debuffing: 3, Ro's Fiery Sundering is nice, but hardly class defining
Crowd Control: 3, root, but tissue paper armor is a limiting factor
Downtime Reduction: 6, pack chloroplast is huge ;)
Tracking: 7
Hostile Territory Travel: 4, just invis
Corpse Recovery: 2
When-The-Shit-Hits-The-Fan: 9, evac, evac, evac
Pulling: 3 indoors, 7 outdoors
Group Desirability: 7, druids bring a lot to the table
Solo ability: 8, quad kiting...'nuf said.
Resurrection: 0 
Epic Difficulty: 5, this used to be a 1, but spawned faydedar and the
venril sathir remains have made the druid epic a lot more accessable.
Epic Power: 6, powerful DoT and snare

SHAMAN:
Damage Absorb: 5, 8 if the mob is slowed
Taunt: 7, slow, malo, healing, dots, nukes = major taunt
Damage Avoid: 4, root
Pet: 6, not a hard hitting pet (because it doesn't quad like necro/magician
pets), and costs a fucking FORTUNE in mana, but the lack of material
component is a huge plus.
Root: 7
Snare: 1, trolls who worship innoruuk can get the snare necklace
Travel: 5, Spirit of Wolf
Melee Damage: 4, good melee caps, but lack of double attack hurts
Spell Damage: 7, strongest dots in the game, minor nukage
Healing: 9, torpor is godly, regrowth is fabulous
Buffing: 10, best in the game
Mob Debuffing: 10, best slow, unresistable resist debuff, cripple,
blindness
Crowd Control: 5, better than druids by virtue of superior armor
Downtime Reduction: 6, cannibalize and regrowth are huge
Tracking: 0
Hostile Territory Travel: 5, castable invis plus alchemy IVU
Corpse Recovery: 3
When-The-Shit-Hits-The-Fan: 3
Pulling: 5, slows make great pulls
Group Desirability: 8, hard to go wrong with a shaman
Solo ability: 8, very strong (10, with a fungi tunic)
Resurrection: 0
Epic Difficulty: 8, one of the easiest epics in the game
Epic Power: 3, the dot is a soloing tool, and almost useless in a group

WARRIOR:
Damage Absorb: 10...nobody comes close
Taunt: 9
Damage Avoid: 4 only way to avoid taunting would be to not use the skill,
and to not attack
Pet: 0
Root: 0
Snare: 1, several good snaring weapons
Travel: 1
Melee Damage: 8
Spell Damage: 1, procs only
Healing: 1, bandages only

Mob Debuffing: 0
Crowd Control: 6, a warrior taunting is a highly effective way to keep an
add busy
Downtime Reduction: 0
Tracking: 0
Hostile Territory Travel: 1, warriors have several class-only invis click
items
Corpse Recovery: 3
When-The-Shit-Hits-The-Fan: 3 Stand and die buddy
Pulling: 7
Group Desirability: 9, other classes can tank well, but the warrior is the
prefered choice
Solo ability: 2, warriors bite ass at soloing
Resurrection: 0
Epic Difficulty: 1, dragon killing requirements, PoA raid requirement, and
Chardok raid (and all the expensive purchases) make the warrior epic one of
the worst to try and get
Epic Power: 4, for how hard it is, there are SO many weapons in velious
that eat it alive...many warriors don't even bother with the quest, and
many more have their epics banked because they wield something *far* better

MONK:
Damage Absorb: 8, less hp than warriors, but their AC and superior
defensive skills compensate
Taunt: 9, monks often taunt a lot more than they want to
Damage Avoid: 7, feign death is great for this
Pet: 0
Root: 0
Snare: 0
Travel: 1
Melee Damage: 9, sometimes 10, depending on gear (ie: Bo Staff of
Trorsmang)
Spell Damage: 1, procs only
Healing: 1, bandages
Buffing: 0 
Mob Debuffing: 0
Crowd Control: 5, monks can occupy mobs pretty well
Downtime Reduction: 4, mend is nice, but self-only
Tracking: 0
Hostile Territory Travel: 7, feign death and sneak
Corpse Recovery: 9, feign death and sneak ;)
When-The-Shit-Hits-The-Fan: 6, feign death helps the monk, doesn't help the
group
Pulling: 8
Group Desirability: 8
Solo ability: 5, with a fungi tunic, this goes to 8 (course, that could be
said about a lot of classes, but monks benefit especially).
Resurrection: 0
Epic Difficulty: 7, except for a couple of the camps (mostly raster), monks
have one of the easiest epics in the game
Epic Power: 8, great stats, and the instant cast haste buff is incredibly
useful

ROGUE:
Damage Absorb: 6, rogues have "ok" hp and ac
Taunt: 9, rogues taunt like mad
Damage Avoid: 9, evade is godly
Pet: 0
Root: 1, available through various poisons
Snare: 2, snaring weapons and poisons
Travel: 1
Melee Damage: 10...cuisinarts
Spell Damage: 1, procs only
Healing: 1, bandages
Buffing: 1, right-click armor buffs
Mob Debuffing: 3, some rogue poisons are insanely nice debuffs, but are
expensive and the skill is difficult to raise
Crowd Control: 1
Downtime Reduction: 0
Tracking: 0
Hostile Territory Travel: 9, sneak/hide, and illusion masks let rogues go
almost anywhere
Corpse Recovery: 9, a specialty
When-The-Shit-Hits-The-Fan: 2, yer screwed
Pulling: 5, sneak pulling, while effective, is REALLY HARD TO DO
Group Desirability: 9...cuisinarts
Solo ability: 1, worse than warriors
Resurrection: 0
Epic Difficulty: 10, easiest epic in the game
Epic Power: 10, the ragebringer can let a solo rogue KS an entire raid.

SHADOWKNIGHT:
Damage Absorb: 8, SKs are superb tanks
Taunt: 10, SKs have masterful taunting ability with their melee and dots
Damage Avoid: 7, feign death is good
Pet: 6, always underpowered for their level, the 58 pet is nevertheless a
major force
Root: 0
Snare: 5
Travel: 1
Melee Damage: 7, lack of dual wield hurts
Spell Damage: 4, decent dots, nothing fabulous
Healing: 0
Buffing: 0
Mob Debuffing: 5, boosted because of their ability to Fear
Crowd Control: 7, easy for SKs to distract an add
Downtime Reduction: 0
Tracking: 0
Hostile Territory Travel: 6, invis, IVU, and feign death
Corpse Recovery: 7, invis, ivu, and feign death...actual corpse summons at
high level
When-The-Shit-Hits-The-Fan: 5, feign death saves the SK, but nobody
else..not as reliable as monk feign (so lower rating)
Pulling: 7
Group Desirability: 7, nice to have, but people rarely seek them out
Solo ability: 5, fear, dots, melee, pet...and feign for when it goes wrong.
Resurrection: 0
Epic Difficulty: 2, a bad one. Lots of rare drops, and if you fail on the
last fight, not only is all the work you did totally wasted, but you can
NEVER try again.
Epic Power: 3...there are 1H weapons without number that are VASTLY
superior to Innoruuk's Curse...made all the worse by the fact that those 1H
weapons let you use a shield, and the IC does not.
Special Category: Epic Appearance: 10, SKs have the coolest looking epic
weapon in the game

RANGER:
Damage Absorb: 6, limited to chain hurts rangers in the tanking role
Taunt: 8, ranger melee often gets them taunting a lot more than they want
to
Damage Avoid: 7, the jolt spells are nice
Pet: 0
Root: 5
Snare: 8
Travel: 4, spirit of wolf
Melee Damage: 8, rangers are killing machines
Spell Damage: 3, meager spells
Healing: 4, limited to greater heal, but better than nothing
Buffing: 6, a surprising strong suit...wolf form and other ATK buffs are
nice to have
Mob Debuffing: 3
Crowd Control: 5
Downtime Reduction: 0
Tracking: 10, best range, most sorting options
Hostile Territory Travel: 6, sneak and invis
Corpse Recovery: 4
When-The-Shit-Hits-The-Fan: 2
Pulling: 7 indoors, 10 outdoors (SoW + Archery + Tracking + Harmony)
Group Desirability: 7, rangers add a lot to a group
Solo ability: 5...can fear animals well, this goes to 7 with the epics
Resurrection: 0
Epic Difficulty: 5, not as bad as it used to be (VS remains
again)...getting the stone out of Hate can be a nightmare
Epic Power: 8, ranger epics are incredibly good.

PALADIN:
Damage Absorb: 8, paladins are excellent tanks
Taunt: 8, stuns, nukes, melee
Damage Avoid: 4, not much

Root: 5
Snare: 0

Spell Damage: 4
Healing: 6, up to superior heal
Buffing: 4, minor buffs
Mob Debuffing: 5, stuns
Crowd Control: 5, root/stuns/tanking
Downtime Reduction: 5, make good downtime healers, especially with the
deepwater helm
Tracking: 0
Hostile Territory Travel: 3, IVU is limited
Corpse Recovery: 5
When-The-Shit-Hits-The-Fan: 7, lay hands, divine aura can easily save
someone's bacon
Pulling: 7
Group Desirability: 7
Solo ability: 3, paladins are rather stinky soloists, maybe boost this to 4
against undead
Resurrection: 8, max out with the 90% rez
Epic Difficulty: 3, dragon killing requirement is highly unpleasant...the
vox book in particular. Also have to work on the epic your whole life
(soulfire, ghoulbane, etc)
Epic Power: 4, only so-so, especially for tunare worshipping paladins who
can get Nature's Defender with greater ease. Suffers similar problems to
the SK epic: lots of 1H weapons are better. Looks spiffy tho.

BARD:
Damage Absorb: 6, they wear plate, but tanks they are not
Taunt: 7, a bard with his songs laid out just-so can out-taunt most folks
Damage Avoid: 5
Pet: 0
Root: 3, limited to singing
Snare: 5
Travel: 6, Selos = ubbah
Melee Damage: 5, dual wield, but no double attack, and no primary hand
damage bonus. Lots of *really* nice ratio weapons compensate for this
Spell Damage: 6, bards can song-dot stuff into puddles
Healing: 6, Cantata
Buffing: 8, theres almost nothing a bard can't buff
Mob Debuffing: 8, occlusion of sound tops the list, lots of other stuff too
Crowd Control: 7, good ability
Downtime Reduction: 9...cantata of replenishment. 'Nuff said.
Tracking: 5
Hostile Territory Travel: 5, invis, ivu, sneak
Corpse Recovery: 4
When-The-Shit-Hits-The-Fan: 4
Pulling: 4
Group Desirability: 5...lord only knows why bards aren't more popular than
they are...they fucking rock
Solo ability: 5...bards can safely solo very well...it just takes FOREVER
to kill stuff
Resurrection: 0
Epic Difficulty: 1, probably the hardest epic in the game. Dragon killing
requirements redefine ugly.
Epic Power: 10, the hasting effect is minor, what is HUGE is that the
Singing Steel Shortsword acts as a full power magical instrument of ALL
instrument types...at a guestimate, the SSS doubles a bard's effectiveness.
