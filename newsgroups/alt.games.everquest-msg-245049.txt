Yes.  DI/UD3 are core for a raiding cleric.  The success rate is high, and
the guaranteed "heal on fail" (which looking in a log, healed me for 4800 on
a failure) is all added bonuses, rather than your tank just dropping down
dead.

There are times it wont work.. if your tank goes from 20% to dead in 1 hit,
it would't even have chance to fire.. but aside from that, the spell is
incredibly useful.

More often than not it means the difference between success and a wipe.
