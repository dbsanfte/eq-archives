I hooked up with a Necro from my guild to form a LDON group for Mistmoore
Catacombs last night, and we rocked the place!

The group ended up being:

1 Necro
2 Magicians
1 Shaman
1 Ranger
1 Cleric

One group member was 39, but the rest were in the low 40's.

We did a Slaughter mission and had to kill 58 mobs. The group completed the
mission in 44 minutes even though the other Magician went LD 3 times. 3 augs
and 1 head slot item dropped, and the 5 of us who met up in PoK for the loot
split (the Necro declined) made about 75pp. I won a +3 Int aug (Bonded it to
my Robe of Concussion), the other Mage won a Disease Resist aug, and the
Ranger won a Dex aug. The Cleric won the roll on the head slot item when we
met in PoK to split the loot.

I was mainly damage shielding the Ranger and my pet for most of the fights -
The pets and Ranger were doing enough damage that I didn't have to nuke
much, and I only cast Elemental Maelstrom a couple of times. (Once on a mob
that kept healing itself, and another time on a mob when we were fighting 3
mobs at once)

Worst things that happened were: Ranger pulling 3 mobs by accident and me
getting hit with Dooming Darkness and my pet (I was using Water) ending up
at about 45% hit points before the fight was over; Ranger ending up at 25%
hit points during one fight because only one pet was tanking the same mob
(there were three mobs pulled - Intentionally - And only the Shaman's spirit
wolf was helping the Ranger); the other Magician going LD three times.
