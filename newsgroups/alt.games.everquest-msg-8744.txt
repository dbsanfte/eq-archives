I get bored with the hack-n-slash as well. My Ranger is only lvl 23, and it
seems to take forever...

When bored/frustrated I go play one of my low level alts. (Bards are kinda
fun) /boogle
This makes for a change of pace, and lets me learn a bit more about how the
other classes function.
Or I just hang out in a newbie area, and buff/heal for awhile.

Not long ago I decided that I was going to gather up a couple stacks of the
components requried for my Trueshot Bow. It took a couple of evenings, but
was a nice change of pace. And I managed to Fletch my bow on the 6th
attempt, which was kinda cool.

The drive to level, and keep up with friends can be a bit much.
There is also the perception that there is just so much you can do at a
given level.
Trade skill options are a bit limited when you're scrimping and saving every
copper.
Exploring new Zones can potentially be too risky when you weight the cost of
Death, exp loss, and CR.
New spells are SO much fun. (I get SOW at lvl 30, and am REALLY looking
forward to that, but am dreading the hack-n-slach that it's gonna take.)
