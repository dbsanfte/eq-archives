It is very american to defend someone you know is guilty. The purpose of
lawyers and courts are to have 2 individuals present the facts of a case in
the best possible manner to a jury for the jury to decide. Since people are
fallable this does sometimes seem to let guilty people off but our courts
where designed such that it is far better to let a guilty man go free then
to convict an innocent one. If this was the main problem with lawyers we
would have no problem :)

The system of punitive dammages is unique to america and has turned out to
be a huge failure. No one had tried it before so we had no idea and can be
excused for it if we can get around to fixing it soon. English courts that
award compensation to make a person whole are far preferrable . The civil
courts in the US, and all the lawyers that abuse them are a joke :(

It does not help things that juries are usually comprised of our least
competent people who do not have anything else to do.
