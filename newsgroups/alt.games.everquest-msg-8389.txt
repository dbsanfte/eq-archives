I don't think that was bad tracking by the designers. Speaking as
somebody who has been ganked by that bad boy on more than one occasion,
I think that gnoll tracks there just to make is somewhat more
challenging to camp one of the fastest spawning, campable solo
opportunities in the game. Same with that blasted cyclps that comes
through there every now and again.
