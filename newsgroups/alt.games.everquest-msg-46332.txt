Good suggestions, all.  I have to admit, though,
I have an unreasonable bias against playing a
druid (and I would be the main spell caster of
the duo).  Not because of any inherent fault 
with the class.  No, my problem is that I hate
playing a class that is over represented.  I have
no doubts but that druids will be very, maybe
insanely popular on the new server.  I just 
can't bring into being _another_ damned druid.
   He, being of the tank mentality, simply 
cannot tolerate the idea of being a monk.  
The weight restriction gets to him, you see.
And neither of us really want to be lizards.
We simply feel there is more travel opportunity
with the Old World races, and yes, travel is
going to be important to us.
