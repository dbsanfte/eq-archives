Oh I enjoyed it. even with all the bugs introduced with the various
expansions. Using the work arounds until the fixes where release (some
weren't). Its just as of late there seems to be too much not to my
liking. The new /petition system. While some claim to have got it to
work I tried and got fed up with it. And if I read the official forums
correctly so did quite a lot of others. Its a griefers dream come
true. No one will use the petition system so they have free rein of
EQ.

Add to that the majority of people are in TSS zones and I won't buy it
since it isn't retail. My fault/problem I know but since theres no one
to group with theres no reason for me to play the game anymore. I
can't solo the level 60+ mobs.

What I find amusing is Soe asked for feedback on the new petition
system and at last viewing there were only 2 positive remark in 11
pages of that thread. And one could be considered a neutral comment
(imo).
