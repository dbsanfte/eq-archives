I don't have a ranger high enough in level to answer the tracking question, 
but I understand it can be very handy.

In the teens, using the cheapest arrows I can make, I can bow kite, but 
it's slow.  I do have a decent bow that was handed down to me some time 
back.

Rangers can solo quite effectively, you just need to find a place where you 
can kill animals.  Before level 22, it doesn't much matter, hunt anything, 
for bow kiting, I snare the target, shoot at it while running backwards.  
You just need to watch for adds.  At level 22, rangers get an animal only 
fear spell, then, it gets easier, snare, fear, beat on the animal until one 
wears off, refresh.  Again, you have to pick your areas to try to avoid 
adds.
