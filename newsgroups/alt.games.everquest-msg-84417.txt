  2,000 platinum is a little steep from what I've been seeing (though
from a functional standpoint it's certainly worth that much,
especially for a monk).  It's been selling for about 1,000 platinum on
my server, though I guess our economy isn't really inflated yet.  I
think it's eventually going to be one of those things that everyone
above level 35 has, since the quest really isn't all that difficult.
