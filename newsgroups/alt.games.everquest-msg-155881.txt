The message you get is something like "Reporting the last X lines of
text regarding [/reportParameterHere]".  Do not confuse this auto-
generated string with what the game actually does.  I've been thru
this with Guides/GMs, other folks have posted to the newsgroup, and
I'm pretty sure that VI has made statements on their website and/or
message-of-the-day and/or patch messages that describe the function
of the command as I did above.  And if the thing actually tried to
filter your chat buffer it would be worse than useless, stripping
context, or worse yet stripping everything if you typo'd the report
parameter.  The report is made "regarding" the parameter you give (i.e.
it is equivalent to the subject line in an email), the only filtering
is to limit the reported text to what you have displayed in your chat
window.
