As you can see the level 15 pet (16 summon) is the strongest relative
to the BL himself and the mobs that you fight. The pet process is a
magic based 30dd spell. Getting to 22 is a breeze. 

The level 22 Warder is an even con and quickly becomes weak compared
to the BL and the mobs you fight....8 levels to grind through to 30
and 27-30 can get a bit rough solo.

At level 30 your pet is already 4 levels below you. The trip from
30-39 (9 levels) is the a tough speed bump for a character used to
soloing. There are very few places to solo 35-39 effectively if you
are untwinked.

At level 39 your pet is a MONSTER. You get a 60% pet haste buff, and
hunting Hill Giants solo is doable (but not trivial). You have 10
levels to go before your next pet upgrade, and if you think 35-39 was
tough, you ain't seen nothing yet heheh. 44-49 are brutal, and
generally make or break the class for many players not heavily twinked
or PL'd. There are only a small handfull of places to solo and these
are usually heavily camped by other BLs hehe. The recent addition of
the "Spiritual" line of spells really helps these levels with a
3hp/3mana regen, and makes the BL much more desired in groups.

I've only played my BL on FV to 44. By 40 I have all of my skills
(block, riposte, etc), and all of my "class defining" and utility
spells (first Spiritual spell, pet process, SoW, Lev, etc). I fully
intend to take the class further, but I first want to experiment with
the different BL races. (see sig)
