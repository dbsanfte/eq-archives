Ohh duh, that probably explains it.  I've noticed that many shammy/druid 
mobs see invis themselves, but not right away.  So they end up seeing 
invis about half the time.  He should be amiable to me now... sometime if 
I get bored I'll go sit by him and experiment in depth. :) Assuming he 
stays up more than a couple minutes, of course.
