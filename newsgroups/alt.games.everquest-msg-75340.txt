My druid has put 2 points into movementt speed so far, and its definitly
going to be the first point for my bard in 1 more level. No more having to
twist selos to kite, and no more getting run down in dungeons. My druid may
have already have 1 life saved when wolf form got dispelled by a chromo
yesterday.

After 3 points of enhanced movement, the next 3 are going into innate magic
resistance. I hate root, especially how agro greens seem to be so successful
at getting it to stick. Wish I was that deadly against reds with my spells.
