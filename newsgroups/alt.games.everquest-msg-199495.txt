	Frankly, I don't think the Father, Son and Holy Spirit could change your
opinion, even with all the archangels and saints assisting.

	Sorry, but as people have tried to tell you, it's just not that easy.
Getting EndQ/AM 3 certainly made me a viable member of a trial group but in
and of itself it did not and could not get me flagged.  You can't do it
yourself, no matter what, and therein is the problem.

|b) You commit a portion of your time (30% - 40% would be more than 
|reasonable) to helping guildmates also get through the trials.

	This is the point.  It's NOT reasonable.  Not only is that a huge chunk of
time, IT'S NOT ENOUGH.

|The fact that not everyone who has gotten flagged has done it under the

|guild.

	If 90% of the casual guilds that hit the trials break, and 10% make it
through (almost certainly ceasing to be casual in the process), are you
seriously going to argue the 90% were "lacking"?
	
|Believe it or not, I have no 
|trouble at all admitting when I am wrong.

	You can't even admit that you don't know what you're talking about, never
mind that you could be wrong.

	Wait until you try getting your epic, or planar or better armor, or a host
of other difficult tasks in EQ.  You know nothing.
