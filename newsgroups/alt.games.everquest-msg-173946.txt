I pretty much agree with most of what you wrote.  But this bit,
blaming the use of economic sanctions on the UN with the clear
implication that the US is somehow not responsible just doesn't
wash. The US has strongly supported the sanctions.  I would note
that our government has unilaterally used similar sanctions for
over 40 years now against Cuba, with same effect on Castro's rule
that you describe for Iraq/Saddam above, showing rather clearly
that our government is no more sensible in this regard than any
other.  It's really pretty obvious, and quite clear from events
in Germany/Cuba/Iraq and many other places, that when you hurt
a people in this fashion (i.e. inflicting chronic misery in their
daily lives) they respond by rallying around the first leader who
appears strong enough to give them hope of relief.  This isn't
just between nations, you can see similar dynamics in early labor
movements as well as a number of revolutionary movements in history.
