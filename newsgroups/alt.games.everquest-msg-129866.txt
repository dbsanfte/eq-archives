rhetorical tactic?  assuming that is true.. will you prove me wrong?  will
you prove my sources wrong? you have yet to cite sources/facts.. only your
interpretations/opinions.

this applies to you to then -

okay, listen closely.  i've given you links to check out and question.  you
refuse to by calling it BS.  I have given sources, and they list their
sources.  you claim AI is bullshit, but you fail to challege teh facts that
they present!  why?  maybe be cause you can't!!!!  your desire to be right
overwhelms your desire for truth!!!
i challenge you to find a credible, unbiased, non-profit source that
disproves AI's claims!

www.amnesty.org
specifically..
http://web.amnesty.org/ai.nsf/Index/MDE150742002?OpenDocument&of=COUNTRIES\I
SRAEL/OCCUPIED+TERRITORIES

assuming it is bullshit as you say, can you find some concrete evidence to
disprove their claims?
judging from your posts.. you can't. you don't know what true research is!!!
go on!  prove me wrong!  prove AI wrong!

you have yet to list a source!  you want more sources of information from
those who are non-isreali and non-palestinian (beside the 3 links i've given
so far)?

more challenges for you -

http://www.nlg.org/statements%20&%20pr/NLG_mideast_statement.htm
are you prepared to do the research and disprove their claims?!  if they're
wrong, why don't you contact them and inform them that what they say is
wrong?
i challenge you!  or is what you say unsupported bullshit, like i've claimed
all along?!

what about this stat http://www.guardian.co.uk/graphic/0,5812,712593,00.html
how do you explain these numbers?  were there really 1400 combatants?  come
now.  this is just disrespect for Palestine life!
did cars (as seen on news networks) have to run over?  did building have to
completely destroyed?

http://www.icrc.org/Web/Eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/57JNTP?OpenDocument&style=cust
o_final
how would you challenge this?  is this too much to ask for? is AI
bullshitting?  can you find proof in the form of hard facts to disprove
their argument?

regarding the oppression that refuses to be acknowledged by you people (from
the international red cross) -
http://www.icrc.org/Web/Eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/5AKGCG?OpenDocument&style=cust
o_final
a piece from that article:

"On repeated occasions, IDF soldiers fired without warning on ambulances and
medical staff. In March, four emergency medical workers - two from the
PRCS - were killed in four different incidents, while other medical team
members were wounded by Israeli fire. PRCS ambulances and an ICRC vehicle
were also either destroyed or badly damaged in the recent violence. These
serious violations of basic humanitarian law were immediately reported to
the Israeli authorities."

is this defense?  there is complete disregard for palestinian life here!!!
key words - "without warning".

quit wasting my time by whining with your unsupported opinions.  you whine
about how amnesty internation isn't credible and yet you offer NOTHING to
disprove their claims!!!  Arguing relentlessly without any kind of factual
support is what? whining... much like a child would do.

what do you people cite?  FNC!!! who owns those channels?  who contributes
millions to political campaigns???  more than 10 million dollars went to
political campaigns in 1998, and that was from California top 10
contributors alone!!! (source - L.A. Times/Lynn Meersman). Why?  the news is
skewed to the interests of these corporate leeches, and our politicians come
from within that same group (proof - Dick Cheney's involvement with Enron,
Halliburton).  you are citing a source that reports the news as THEY see
fit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and you call AI bullshit?!! hahahahahahaha

are you going to prove me wrong? do it then!  again, i challenge to find
facts that prove me wrong!  opinions are opinions.  find some hard facts!

this thread has become a waste of time.  opinions are sent back and forth,
but little references are mentioned?  why?  the high level of bullshit.
is this debate or a forum of children arguing?  debate involves argument AND
RESEARCH.   where is the research.  SLANG offered a couple of sources but
both were clearly pro-isreali!  if i remember correctly, one was devoted to
the protection of isreal!!! and yet, my links to AI, ZMAG are disregarded
WITHOUT challenging the facts stated.  is the fear of being wrong???  one
person even questioned the credibility of Noam Chomsky's work @ ZMAG.  did
you look into his sources, which were listed at the bottom, or did you just
spit out more bullshit?!  take a philosophy, anthropology, and/or sociology
and understand his contributions to those fields.

i CHALLENGE you to find unbiased (non-isreali, non-palestinian), non-profit
sources to base your disproval of the facts that i have presented to you in
the link provided!
you have yet to so.  why waste my time any longer with you children who are
unable to just that?

this concludes my argument.  there simply isn't any credible, supported
argument for me to challenge!  i've literally gone back and copy/pasted
replies.  its become that redundant.  Assuming what i say is believed to
wrong, including my sources, (as is the case with many of you) - can you
present hard facts and unbiased sources to prove it?  i have yet to see more
than just simple opinions... long and short - but equally unsupported (no
unbiased sources were presented).

(cite info from real sources.. not FNC! - take a college sociology class and
learn something about our media's role in politics!!!!)

if you believe you can fulfill this challenge.. by all means.. go for it.  i
can be found at the newsgroup alt.music.tool  - just post a new thread.
if you can't - at least you tried.. now you know better.

to those who supported the unbiased truth.. thank you.. you've recognized
the truth as being the most effectively constuctive.
true realists.

good night.
