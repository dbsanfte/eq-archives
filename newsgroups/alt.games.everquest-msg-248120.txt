A 12K tank in Fear? I think you'll do ok...

Definitely.

Bleh, get rid of this and load Supernal Remedy.

>Celestial Elixir
If they have Sound of Might, they certainly should have Supernal Elixir.
Replace this with Supernal Elixir.

>Supernal Light
If they have a deep mana pool and lots of FT, maybe. This spell is
a mana hog.

Do mobs in Fear gate or complete heal? I don't remember that they do,
but it's been awhile. If yes, I'd say load two stuns, otherwise just
one, and make it Sound of Might since it's fast. 

Definitely replace one by Divine Barrier, possibly one by Divine Aura
too, and find a spot for a fast root like Greater Immobilize. In Fear
you can get a lot of mobs in camp with little warning, so crowd control
(root) and aggro control are important. 

Hotkey Divine Arbitration if the cleric has it. It is a lifesaver when 
you need to heal one party member quickly and there are multiple mobs 
nearby which haven't been locked down by tanks or mezzers.

You shouldn't need DI except maybe against bosses. You didn't say which
bosses you were going after, but CT and one (or two?) of the golems are
death-touchers, which DI won't stop. MotR isn't something you cast on 
your tank. It has to be cast on each mob. As such, I'd probably not 
waste a spell slot on it.
