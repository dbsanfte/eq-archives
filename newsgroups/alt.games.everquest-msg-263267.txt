It didn't autoaim for me, but I started at the 'Normal' difficulty level.
Maybe it did on the level below that.

I'm very glad it didn't, too.  There's too much going on once the Flood is

That's a personal preference.  I've played FPS games on a PC (Doom, MOH:AA,
Painkiller) and on a console (Halo, Unreal).  Six of one, half dozen of the
other to me.  YMMV, of course.
