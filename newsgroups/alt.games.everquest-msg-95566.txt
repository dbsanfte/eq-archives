FWIW, Paludal Caverns are excellent hunting grounds at that level, but
you checked out the wrong area.  Directly next to the Shadowhaven zone
are the recondit bandits, and they're all 20-22 or so.

If you hunt by the Shadeweavers Thicket zone, there are rooms full of
non-aggro static spawns that are easy kills and very good xp at your
level.

Only problem is you'll need help getting to that side of the zone and
past all the Plerg Phlarg Fiends in between.
