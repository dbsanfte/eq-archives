This is indeed a big plus, I enjoy it a lot.

I also really appreciate not having to do the 
sit/mem/stand/cast [repeat] dance while buffing.  Now 
it's mem/cast [repeat].  It sounds minor, but it's 
a *big* relief.

It's also surprising how much of a difference it
makes when you're effectively meditating every
moment that you're not fighting or traveling (at 35+).
Even if you make a real effort to sit down every
instant of "free time" (and boy, how annoying *that*
can get), the horse still manages to squeeze in a
lot of extra "med time" during little bits of time here
and there.  I'm at "full mana" a lot more with the
horse than I had been previously.
