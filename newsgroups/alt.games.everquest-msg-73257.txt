The difference is PLing with multiple high levels DOES happen quite
often.  Many top end guilds, when short of a specific class (usually
one of the three major ones), will PL "mule" account to get the
desired class to a level they need.  This takes at most one spawn
cycle of some major mob, usually much less.

Because if you look at the skill caps for characters, they are level
capped.  Typically from level 40 to 50, there's no skill
increases--almost every skill is capped at around level 40.  You now
have about 10 levels (10 slowest levels between 1 to 50) to raise the
other skills.

Melee classes can trivially raise their melee skills during this time.
Only casting skills might be neglected, but you know how fast and easy
it is to raise those skills by simply chain casting a set of spells.

The only real roadblock to fast leveling this way is the lack of mobs
to kill.  As long as you have a nice steady supply of mobs, it becomes
trivial.  With Kunark, Velious and Luclin, there's never a shortage of
solid blue con mobs anymore.
