Well, rats!  I only recently paid for GoD, and my two main reasons
were (1) the tradeskill quests and (2) a chance to fish for money
that, at my level, is quite good.  (My oldest char is 26, so no way
I'm getting into the new quest content any time soon. :-)

To add insult to injury, they took it down at 2:30 instead of the
usual 3am, and I had some friends over so I didn't get to EQ until
2:35, so I didn't have a chance to sell the fish and crabs that my
daughter collected last night before she got bundled off to bed.

I don't really mind losing the cash cow, and mostly expected it.
Still, I do have to wonder how SOE can possibly put out a release
with new items and give those items ridiculous sales prices, and
not know that they're doing it.  So the cynical part of me (which
is a lot :-) says that they do it deliberately, knowing that word
will get out about how the new expansion offers easy platinum (and
outrageous tribute values, etc.) so people will rush out and buy
it, and after the initial sales taper off they can patch it to nerf
all the things that were deliberately broken.

(Of course, there's an old saying, "Never attribute to malice that
which can be adequately explained by stupidity."  But it would take
a pretty amazing degree of stupidity for those fish prices to have
been an unintentional mistake.)

I'll give them credit for ingenuity, though.  This latest time, by
using Fishing for the broken bit (after the initial rush on tribute
stuff got "fixed"), they ensured that nobody could bot-farm for
plat very fast.  It was great income, and probably would have been
a game-breaker over time as even a newbie could go to the boat and
fish for more money than most untwinked newbies see before level 20,
but they could afford to leave it there for a month to sucker people
into buying the expansion, and they weren't risking having millions
of easy plat thrown into the economy.

Oh, and in case anyone's wondering, the new prices appear to be
about one copper per pound.  Yes, copper.  Jeez, even the "Fresh
Fish" that one catches in other places sells for a silver!  (Any
bakers on EMarr wanna buy some tuna? :-)
