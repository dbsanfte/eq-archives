hmm... this makes me think about an intermitant issue I have in Upper
Guk, Oasis, and I cant rember the other zone... but it is as if Im
running the Chow Chow Chow ( I may be dateing my self with this
comercial refrence)  to other people that are with me...
In fact When this happens I am unable to reasonably control my
character, in fact when this happens in UGuk it is an assured death
for me (yep Kos to the live froggys)

but this issue will stay untill I log out and reboot my machine....
and on some occasions this will not resolve the issue... until the
next day when the problem is non existant.

Very weird stuff is afoot in Norath.
