Myself being a paladin, iw as always wondering when to do my AAs. I stuck it
out till 54, before i was overcome by the sensation to put my exp into AA.
So i started 50/50 and iw as happy, got my first 3 aa's and leveled in the
same time.

At 55, i was a Knight. So i thought feck it, i'll go for my 6 AAs, get Baron
and then grab 61 before anymore AAs. It goes fast when you are tanking PoD
XCY, maybe 1% per kill. But it gets boring, seeing the exp bar move every
kill ;) So i got my 4th AA and carried on leveling.

Now at 58 and im nearly hitting 59, i sometimes wish i hadn't done AAs, as i
would have been 59, maybe 60, with all that exp. But ah well, happens. So if
u'll excuse me, im off to play my favourite past-time.
