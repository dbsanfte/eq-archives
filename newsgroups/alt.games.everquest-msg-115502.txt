I remember a PoF c.r raid i lead before.. 2 small guilds had been wiped
trying to do a bunker breakin (50+ corpses = horrendous lag!)

With the lower level people, the agro in there was shot to hell (the lower
your level the more mobs you agro) and I swear PoF mobs don't reset
properly... I took 2 groups of 59+ in to ae c.r them, only for some idiot
low 50's monk to train half the zone on us..  he had some stupid thoughts in
his mind that we were only pretending to help c.r, when in reality we were
going to kill the demi's (an nToV guild doesn't really have much to gain
from killing plane demis..)

DT demi's were up, which made moving *all* the corpses to the north wall a
real painstaking process (if you FD when a wandering mob agros you, then
wait for it to carry on wandering, and stand back up, 9 times out of 10 when
it re-agros you it runs right through the middle of the zone (where the
demi's are situated) and you get DT'd..

56 or so corpes later, there were 2 monks left alive... and between us, we
managed to kill every mob that came within a 10 yard radius of the new
corpse spot (had 2 mobs at one point)

Unfortunately all the rez timers were expired.. so all these naked people
(or wearing nasty red coloured summoned mage armours) had to re-enter PoF,
and run to the new spot.

Heh it was kindof funny.. a guildie who had been helping (till he got dt'd
on his monk) wanted to see the newbie massacre as they re-entered.. so he
logged his necro in, ran to the north wall, and FD'd next to me and the
other monk.

The deaded people were given *very* strict instructions on which way to
run.. not to worry about agro.. to just get to us and camp out (if they
could)

Well maybe we under-estimated the agro radius of level 46 ppl.. or some
people are just tards.. we got mobs from the other side of the zone
(including glare lords...)

Watching the huuuuuuuge trains as group after group ran to us (only to then
get butchered in about 2 hits each) was really amusing (after a 7hour c.r
for me personally).. until of course that train of glare lords hit us.

Their ae-dispell broke all 3 of our FD's.. and I've never seen the necro go
from so smug with glee to sheer panic, so fast before... hehe, he was like
"weee this is fun.. sure helps with the frustration of toda.. shit!  they
agrod glare lordsï¿½!!!"

Getting FD broken when half the zone is on or around you isn't a pretty
sight!

Heh I think the saddest part of that day.. after everybody was rezzed and
buffed, I decided to pull some mobs for them.. try and have something
positive for the day.. well I got 2 mobs together (which me and the other
monk had successfully duo'd earlier), and I swear 10+ people died from a PoF
"double" pull (like that doesn't happen often.)
