BTW - my BL finally has his first loss.  We went hard LDoN's in Tak
with a Cleric, Warrior, Bard, Monk, Necro and my BL.  The first one
we had difficulty at the beginning but got it together and finished
in 60min.  The 2nd one we just couldn't get the pulls clean - one 
person said "You know, in the time it takes us to maybe finish this
we could do 2 normal" and we all chimed in in agreement and left.

We then did 2 more easy, easily.  Some people wouldn't have taken
that group into a hard (the warrior was just elemental flagged,
we only had cleric+bst buffs for hp/haste)  While we couldn't have
finished that particular hard, by the time we'd finished a couple
of easy's and gotten used to each other, I think we could have 
gone back to them.

I'm just happy that we tried them afterall, as it proved that a P/U
group of mostly sub-elemental players could finish hards.
