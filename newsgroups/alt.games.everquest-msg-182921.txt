Others have posted here good ideas. Remember tho, EQ (or any massively
online game) cant provide the unique experience that AD&D can give.
The game has to cater to the thousands, not to the one. This will
always be the case in all online games. AC2 has tried to personalize
the experience somewhat (IMHO it failed - but thats a tired argument
for a different thread).

You play EQ to be social, so thats where its strengths are. If you
really want the personalized play style, there are many single player
games that will fufill your needs (not trying to be sarcastic). That
being said, get into a good guild. Dont just jump on the first shout
from a guild that invites everyone. Shop around. Each guild has its
own agenda. Find the one that suits you the best. Once you get a core
of people around you that you get to know and enjoy being around all
the time, you'll get a new appreciation of the game. Nothing is better
than tackling a challenge together with your comrades.

Also, try quests. Even the not so good ones. Yeah, camping the same
place over and over is mind (and butt) numbing. When you start to do
quests, you start learning more of the story lines that are in the
game, there starts to seem like theres a purpose. Theres alot of
quests that people skip over because the end reward isnt very
desirable. Zones and cities become more alive (to me anyways) when you
explore them deeper beyond the "camp this camp that" mentality. Yeah,
ok, alot of quests require you to camp a particular mob or spot, but
doing it with a purpose is more rewarding.

However if the end result of an item is really important to you, then
many quests will be a waste of your time, but you sound like an
experienced roleplayer looking for more. Give it a try. Stop and smell
the roses.
