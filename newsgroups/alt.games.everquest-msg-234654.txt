Got into a little EQ talk with a colleague today. We were talking about mana
regen.
Now, my magelo says I regen 7 mana per tick, for FT 5. It's true I have FT 5
total on my items (I know I'm gimp!). I assumed the last 2 per tick came
from my Mental Clarity 2 AA I've been working on.
BUT then, how much mana do you regen if you don't have any FT items or MC? I
mean, you still gain mana without either of these. Is it just 1 per tick?
Then how come it isn't included in Magelo profiles, as some sort of base
value.
Any info appreciated.
