I'm surprised (well, somewhat surprised, anyway) that
there's been no discussion of the new NPC caster AI.

Supposedly caster mobs are now casting actual,
level-appropriate spells.   Wizard-type mobs casting
Ice Comet, for instance, as one example.   Seb now
requires raid-type resist gear, according to the chatter
I hear, as one example of the effect the change has had.

Since I was about to take my monk to Dalnir, I'd like to
hear if anyone else has heard (or, better yet, experienced
the changes and knows if they're across-the-board or only
applicable for higher-level mobs.
