Thing is, all the terms of the naming policy exist for the same
reason. A ban on oral sex in private among a code laws intended to
prohibit public indecency does NOT compare to a set of rules
restricting vulgar, copyrighted, and other out of context names in a
fantasy game. Tell me, which one of the naming policies infringes on
the players' right to privacy?

Didn't think so. Stop thrashing.

Once again: The rules are for the players, not the creators. How can
anyone not grasp that simple concept. Are you going to piss and moan
next time you see a cop with his siren blaring and lights flashing on
the way to an emergency run a red light?

They follow the ruleset they've created for THEMSELVES. It is a
seperate ruleset than the one they created for the players. Nowhere is
it even implied that they are bound by the same rules.

Yes, but I still don't see how that relates to some half-assed crack
about "I don't see a rule against criticizing someone for anything"...
That was a desperate shot, and really only succeeded in hitting your
foot.

*Chuckle* You're getting desperate, Dan. If I thought something about
the policy was unreasonable, I'd question it. The fact that I think
it's all perfectly reasonable gives me no reason to question it.

It, however, is not your place to berate and insult people who
disagree with you.
