No one "excludes" Wizards from groups intentionally. They simply look
for more versatile classes first. 

Your typical level 20-25 Wizard sits in Lake of Ill Omen flagged LFG
and begging in OOC/SHOUT, while group after group OOC's for "healer",
"sower", "tank".

>Clerics and warriors can be boring too, yet

Healers and Meat Shields is how 99% of the game is played. Is it any
wonder that Clerics and Warriors are valued at all levels?

Right....And a full balanced group will pull another 20-30 EXP mobs in
the time it takes you to "Blow up 10-20" and med back the mana. You
cannot change the way the game is coded with wishful thinking, and by
wearing a pair "Wizards Rule!" blinders.
