Well,that was my point in the initial posting,I was thinking
max damage for caster types is 2 times the damage in the
ingame weapon description.
This would make the 40/25 staff clearly better than the
22/11 Dagger,but staff does only 37 max damge,so in fact
it is a 40/18 weapon. 
So the formula 2 * damage is misleading when comparing
(caster)weapons.

I know there are 2  *hidden* damage caps on 2 Hand melee
class weapons,at level 20 and 30 I noticed large increases
in maximum damage with my Pally,wielding a Reaver 40/40;
but otherwise the formula 2 * damage seems about right
for *melees*.
