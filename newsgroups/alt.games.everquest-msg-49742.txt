Wow...2 entirely different games really - different graphics, gameplay, and
advancement.  Best idea IMHO, try both.  Both games offer trial times of up
to a month where you need to buy the game, but can spend a little time in
each to decide which one *moves* you most.  I played Ultima Online for
nearly 4 years and enjoyed it thoroughly.   I had always liked Everquest and
simply changed worlds when UO got old.
