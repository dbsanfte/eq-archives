You just went on the wrong day. I got one egg one night, one egg
another night more than a month later (lost patience looking for
griffins on both occasions) and the night I got the last two eggs...
there were griffins EVERYWHERE. I had 4 regular and one elder on
track, and twice I found myself in spots where I had three griffins
within visual range and only needed to turn slightly to see the third.
I even had to gate once because I managed to get a small griffin
train. (I also had to gate once because I rooted myself and rooted a
griffin on top of me instead of fearing it - I felt soo smart :) )

Best of all? Altogether, I had to kill 5 or 6 griffins for the eggs.
