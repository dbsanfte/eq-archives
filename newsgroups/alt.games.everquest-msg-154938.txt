Totally agree, Sentinel got NO use. If you use it as an alarm on a area 
(as i read you could somewhere), all you end up with are LOADS of spam 
on everyone in area.
Use in crowded areas and people start going LD.
Dont even wanna think about what will happen if some moron cast it in 
bazaar. Personally i like my accounts too much to try and get my chanter 
to it.
