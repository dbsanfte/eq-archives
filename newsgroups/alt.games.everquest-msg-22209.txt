You don't have to do anything special to raise those skills if you don't
want to, just go hammer on stuff for fun and profit and they'll go up on
their own as you use them normally.  Unlike Feign Death, where you have
monks dropping dead all the time for no apparent reason, or Safe Fall,
where Monks deliberately jump off the Kelethin death'o-vater.  You don't
*have* to put extra effort into raising warrior skills, you just won't be
as good at dealing damage as someone who did.
