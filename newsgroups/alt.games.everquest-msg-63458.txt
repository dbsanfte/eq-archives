Hello all

I am going to be stationed in Germany shortly after Christmas, and while I
can not imagine doing without my EQ fix, I hear horror stories regarding
internet dialup costs/phone rates there.

Are there any players here that are either US soldiers/airmen that play in
Germany, or Germans that play that can give me a rough estimate of the cost
of dial-up? Or the price to access your ISP  per minute, if there is a local
by-the-minute charge?

Thanks in advance, and I am eager to return to the FRG. Last time I was
there, the internet was barely in in its infancy.
