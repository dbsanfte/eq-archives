Well, since most players past the 30s are in guilds, the "rest of the
community" is a small minority, so I don't see a problem with Verant
putting some resources into guild management.

What Verant should do is, as part of the periodic purging of guilds that
don't have 10 members, mail a guild membership list to the leader of
each guild.  They already are going through the databases to do the
culling, so this probably would not be too much extra work.
