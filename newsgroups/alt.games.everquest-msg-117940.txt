Plenty of blue-to-L57 mobs around, but I suspect you're asking for more.
Fixed level/PH mobs with reasonable HP and low MR, and very low risk of
wanderers or adds?

In-town guards might fit the bill. Maybe Neriak? Faction hits on already
KOS stuff, no wanderers, close to zone i something goes wrong.
