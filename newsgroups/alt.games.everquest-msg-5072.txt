Verm blows.
Too heavy and marginal AC--not to mention only three pieces are worth
the slot in the tinker's bag to hold.

Better to just get a group in the Arena in Kael for Thurg quest
armor--although they may be lighter, they look so utterly retarded.

The best druid armor, I think is the Kael quest armor (Nature Walker's
armor).  The <blank> of Harmony armor from Hate on the second floor is
also pretty spiffy.  Forget the woven grass stuff from Skyshrine.
Unless they are gonna upgrade it considerably, it kinda sucks as well.

If you can't get the quest armor, there some very intersting
crystalline stuff dropping in Velketor--that all white armor on druids
look...well, different.

Oh yeah, ES armor isn't too bad--although, again not as good as the
Velious quest armor, but at least the dark green looks good.  :-)
