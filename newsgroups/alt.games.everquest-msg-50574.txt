Check out http://www.eqtraders.com/ for Smithing info..

You want to practice items that are as close to trivial as possible.. It
saves money..

For instance: (don't quote me on my numbers.. this is just an example.. )

If your skill is 90:

Banded Arms are Trivial at 100
Banded Bracers are Trivial at 92

You will want to do bracers first.. You have a much better chance of making
them, thus getting some of your money back by selling pieces.. If you try
the Arms first, it's true that you can comfortably buy more Molds at once,
but you will end up with more failures, in the end it might save you the
trip of running to buy more/different molds, but it will cost you more, as
you will prolly fail making the arms more..

There was a page Called "K.C.'s Blacksmithing Guide".. And it was a GREAT
page for smithing all the way up to skill 150, but It's not online anymore
and the only record I have is a print out of it.. But there could be a
mirror out there..

http://eq.stomped.com/Skills/Smithing.htm  was the original page I found,
but he also had it at http://www.kcsrealm.com/blacksmith

It doesn't seem to be there anymore, but maybe you can find a mirror out
there.
