Yeah, that is a downside, however I don't know a single person who worries
about ac other than melee gear, and even then, at your stage of the game,
most of them (if not most of your casters/priests as well) should be over or
near the ac soft cap.  Me and my 65 mage friend have a competition over hp
(I'm about 80 hp up on him unbuffed, thx ND1)

Well, yeah, in a group virtue isn't too bad because it's unlikely you'll
have a cleric and druid (mostly the druid part, harhar, *runs off to charm a
froginator*)

Either way you still have to rebuff the dead.  Both buffs last longer than
MGB, so the shorter duration isn't really a critical downside.

Yes, but if you have 40 people in a raid, an extra 120 hp each gives the
raid an extra 4800 hp, that's an, uhh, riposte or something.

Some day try doing Bot9/kazad MGB (make sure no one does virtue unless
specifically asked for it) and see how much grumbling there is.  Then go
back to Virtue.  Lazy casters will be confused and wonder why they're
running low on mana.

Once again, I've never know anyone who cared about the ac-only buff thingy.

Another benefit is that in a clericless group (don't laugh) paladins can
cover symbol (marzin) and with pot9 that's still very close to virtue in hp,
of course with a paladin you've got Brell's too, which more than makes up
for the difference between kazad and marzin, even with just BMB and not BSS,
assuming anyways that the cleric group doesn't have a paladin, which would
make Brells a constant between the groups, like assuming there's a shaman
around or not.

Virtue - 1405 hp
Pot9 + Marzin - 1318 hp
Pot9 + Marzin + BMB - 1543 hp
Pot9 + Marzin + BSS - 1648 hp

It's largely a matter of personal preference, and depending on the other
buffs floating around, yeah the extra slot used by Bot9/marzin might be
detrimental (they really should increase the buff limit to 20 or 25).

I'm not really sure what buff lineup you use, guessing VoQ/virtue/Spiritual
domination/brells/haste/predator/seasons/GoD(mr)/Fot7/ds, and then 2 or 3
self buffs/clickables (aotz (cleric), 10th ring, ds potion, mask(druid),
KHF(emp shawl), lich(necro), arcane rune (enc), cloak(sk)) plus keeping a
slot open for SotW (druid aa short duration HoT/buff, MGBable, doesn't go in
bard box) of course.  So I can see you may run low on buff slots, but cut
down on the self buff/clickable stuff and it should be fairly marginal to
squeeze out another slot, at least to give MGB Bot9/Kazad a try.
