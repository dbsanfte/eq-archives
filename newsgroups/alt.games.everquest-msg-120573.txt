I created a necro over the weekend, because I wanted to try out a true
pet class. I must say that this char. is a solo machine. So far I have
found it *very* easy to take out even and yellow cons, and have walked
away from a red con fight or two.

I have read about fear kiting, and it seems like a neat idea. However,
now at level 9, I have tried to fear mobs like 10 times. I DoT, sic
the pet on the mob, Darkness and then attempt to fear. I was
successful only once, and even then it only lasted like three seconds.
All others were resisted. Is this spell reliable under any
circumstances? What am I doing wrong?
