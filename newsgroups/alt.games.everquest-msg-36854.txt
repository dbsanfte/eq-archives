Now, there is not all that much, though it still happens.

On the other hand, does anyone else remember the first few months after
the release of Velious? A level 40 would zone into Crystal Caverns, find
they were the lowest there by some way, and run out scared.

And CC is almost entirely green to a level 40.

The same with ToFS, Runneyeye after the revamp, etc.

Really, the trivial code, or something like it (it would be better if
there were just zone-specific hp/atk/ac soft caps) is the only way
Verant has of making it worthwhile for lower levels to buy the
expansion. There are already plenty of zones to hunt in and quests to
do, the expansion has to offer unsolved quests and unexplored zones. 

And the only way to keep lower level stuff unexplored and unsolved for
more than 4 hours after the expansion is turned on is to put some kind
of restriction or disincentive on higher level players hunting in newbie
zones.
