You can also turn in items to get tribute points, but there's currently a
problem I expect to get nerfed SOON.  Some items have tribute values far in
excess of the cost to acquire.  For example, an Opal Encrusted Stein (the 25
CHA one) can frequently be bought in the bazaar for 25pp, and can be
purchased from a vendor (if sold by a pottery skiller) for about 30 plat.
Turning one in to the Tribute guy in Felwithe netted me 2100 tribute points,
the equivalent of 21k plat.

On Xegony last night, there were 60 for sale in the bazaar at 25-40pp each.
When I logged, there were none.  Who says High Elves can't be evil?
