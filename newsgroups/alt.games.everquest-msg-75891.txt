I live in Croydon, South London, UK
Went to the local shops to buy SoL on dec 7, because I read on Everlore that
the 7th was the UK release date. Visited EB, HMV and Virgin. Nothing. No
copies of any versoin of EQ any where. Went back again on the 17th, still no
sign of SoL or any other version. Got home and ordered SoL from Amazon UK,
it said that the product usually ships within 2-3 days. WOOT. So even with
the xmas rush it would arrive in time for me to play it on xmas day. Dec 27,
I get an email from Amazon. The product is in short supply, it will take 1-2
weeks longer.
Monday 7 Jan, err, still waiting for game.
Oh well.
