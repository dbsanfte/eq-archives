Others have provided some cites already, so I won't bother. There *can*
be rare exceptions to this rule, such as a warrior with maxed skills and
ungodly powerful uberweapons compared to a monk picking up a new
weapon(s) that they haven't trained up the skill for yet.

But for the most part, yes. Monks will outdamage an equal (and usually
considerably higher) level tank through the whole game. Of course, you
generally don't see them *taking* equal damage as well. he he. This
becomes apparent for encounters like rampage capable giants in Kael,
silly unique mobs of similar ilk, what have you. Then, a 55+ warrior
with defensive /disc will suck it up a lot better.
