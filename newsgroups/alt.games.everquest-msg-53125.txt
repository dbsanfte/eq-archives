Actually bards are mildly overpowered . No one likes them much anyway
though. Bards in my experience are a certain type of person who isnt really
goal oriented . This tends to lead them into being less than suboptimal in
using their abilities . One of the few classes I enjoy seeing played by mr
second computer never played this class before (they at least in my
experience are better than the normal bard) .

The preceding was to get a rise :p the real reasson no one likes them much
is that the stupid blinking buffs block real necessary buffs and cause buffs
to go in the wrong places. It is just far too much aggravation to keep
hounding the bard to stop singing every 2 minutes to renew the buff that
just failed. You cant even suggest they get rid of this feature (by for
instance backloading the bard buffs in the buff chain) because its the prime
reason they are so usefull against the dispelling mobs.
