Really? Course If I remember right its actually pretty dang old now.
Word processors at the time were pretty horrible. They were not
WYSIWYG at all. I remember doing reports for school then on an IBM XT
and printing them out on some line feed printer thing. You had to
manually insert ^^ or crap for when a paragraph would indent, but you
could not actually see what it would look like.

Yeah, I rememberd the date right. 1984! NINETEEN FREAKING 84!!!
God, I was young then. I picked it up in paperback a couple years
after that. I thought it was one of the best books I've ever read. 
Anyone who hasn't read it should pick it up, its just amazing what he
writes about for being made in '84, not just the computer stuff but
things about growing general use tissues which are not rejected and
such (research being done now with stem cells and making tissues
"neutral".)
