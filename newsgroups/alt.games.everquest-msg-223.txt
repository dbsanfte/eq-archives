Started a Necromancer and really like this character so far.
Paineel is a fairly easy town to find everything in (some classes I
gave up on right away because I had to spend too much time lost in
town).  The only thing I haven't found is milk (can anyone tell me
where that is sold).

I like the smith skill and this town has everything I need to run
this skill up to level 41 or so.  By then I will be running around
the world anyway (I hope).

Where can I find a list of towns with a Necro guild in them?


Also do I lose exp if my skeleton makes the kill?
