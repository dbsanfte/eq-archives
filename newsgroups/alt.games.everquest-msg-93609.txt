I believe levels 3 and 4 are like this because of the EXP formula, which
squares the mob level in the numerator.

Lvl 1 exp modifier = 1
Lvl 2 exp modifier = 4
Lvl 3 exp modifier = 9
Lvl 4 exp modifier = 16
Lvl 5 exp modifier = 25

As you level up the ratios between levels go down (don't ask me to prove
this mathematically), so the differences aren't as dramatic as they are for
level 1 and 2 mobs.  For example, a level 4 mob will give you 16 times the
exp of a level 1, while a level 5 mob will only give you 6.25 times the exp
of a level 2.
