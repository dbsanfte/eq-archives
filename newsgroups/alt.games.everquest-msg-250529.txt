A bow is still a good investment, nevertheless. Just dont shoot it
while standing near the guards heh.

With a bow, you can get the mobs attention from afar and have THEM run
towards you. SOmetimes you may pick a nice spot to kill stuff and you
don't want to wander from it. So rather then wack a mob, then turn
around and run back while they get a couple of rounds in following
you, can shoot it with a bow and let thme come at you.
