I did this quest twice to equip my ranger at about lvl 25, with the help
from a friend. (Ranger, lvl 47, for SoW, Lev, Camo, and Panic animal when
things went wrong! lol)

The swords are nice if you have high dex because they proc more (they start
procing at lvl 20 as far as i know). I was dual wielding them and found that
that they do not hit particularly hard, but they do get quite a lot of agro
as they proc (which is about 70 80 hp direct damage to the mob).

SO... if you solo / tank alot you will enjoy them as i did, but if you DONT
want agro i would suggest getting something that hasnt got a proc

Hints: If you do go for the quest, the venom sack or whatever its called
drops off snakes in Oasis / So Ro , cant remember which exactly, but its
around Oasis. The foraged items have to be foraged in Stonebrunt. Just
outside the warrens zone tunnel is where i did it.
It would help if you had someone available to SoW and Lev you for running
roung the mountains, or you will die just from falling! And if you get agro
from one of the 'Titans' (Named animal mobs) they are quite tough. I dont
know what faction they are on, but i seem to remember a particularly nasty
snake called Slyder the Ancient (or something similar) nearly wiping my
unprepared ranger out at level 40 with just one DoT ('deadly poison' if i
remember rightly)

Hope this info helps you, and if by some chance you are on the E Marr
server, send me a tell :)
