I have this, but unfortunately I'm only level 51 now.  Had a Wizzy
give me Wake of Karana and Form of the Howler for a level 52 Enchanter
spell I had.  And, for the record, I did try to throw all the plat I
had (about 1k at the time) into the trade too, but the guy wouldn't
have it.  I still felt like I pulled one over on the guy though.
