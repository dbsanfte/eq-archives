    It would have made more sense, given that druids had always been the
"regen" class. I don't think clerics would require a low-aggro heal,
although it would be nice. We are a plate class, after all. A direct heal
with near-CE efficiency would have been great, though. But we got CE and
CelHeal, and druids got nada. =(
