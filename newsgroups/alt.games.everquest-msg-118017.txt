HighKeep is also very good experience at your level.  Head to the basement
and fight goblins.  There are several rooms, each one gets harder, and you
can level all the way to about 34 in there.  (Of course that would be
incredibly boring) Anyway, it's one of the easiest, fastest and most
convenient zones in the game.
