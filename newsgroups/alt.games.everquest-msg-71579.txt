Ok i had problems as well with bad packet loss, try this.

disable as much as you can from the task bar b4 playing. hit ctrl alt del
and stop naprotect from running, look at the eq web site and make the
alterations to your system ini file make sure you dont have any fire wall
software running zone alarm is a big one for this, if you are using 98 or me
makes sure in your msconfig you have the use 512 meg of ram box ticked, and
last but not least make a hot key up with /serverfilter on in it and when
you start lagging press the hot key a few times might help i seems to have
for me.
