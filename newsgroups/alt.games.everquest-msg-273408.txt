Everquest Platinum costs $20, Omens of War costs $20, Everquest II
costs $40.  Looks like the same price to me, pretty much, and OoW is
optional, especially to a newbie.  Admittedly if you want to get both
OoW and Dragons of Norrath, once that's out, you'll end up spending
more than you would on EQ2, but then you'll have a lot more content
available, too (at least if you're happy soloing or can convince
someone to go there with you).

Distributors outside the US have different pricing, of course, but
that's hard for SOE to do much about, I suspect.
