I've been researching DoN, and while I'm finding some really good info none 
of it seems to have levels included.  I'll see something like "This mob is a 
light blue to green con and an easy kill", but I have no idea what that's in 
reference to .. is the mob light blue to a level 50 character or a level 70 
character.

At what level does a character become viable for DoN progression?
