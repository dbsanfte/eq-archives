Spending mana hurting mobs is a Terrible way to get exp as a high level 
druid. Quad kiting, root rotting, I don't care.  If you aren't charming 
an animal and having it kill stuff for you you might as well be in 
crushbone for all the exp you are getting, relatively speaking.

IF you don't feel like doing that, get a group, again, far better exp 
than you are going to get by killing stuff on your own hook.
