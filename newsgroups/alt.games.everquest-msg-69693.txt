Damn I always forget something, I swear I would lose my head if it was not
attached to my neck.
The main culprit for "gaming" under 98 or XP is DX8.1 and how it handles
Direct 3D. I have already talked with Nvidia by phone with a driver tech
about this and they know about it... I told em how I fixed my system back by
going back to 8.0a and they seemed to appreciate my help and said they would
tell other callers what I did to fix-up my system. Now as for XP I donno
since it's incorporated with 8.1... Another note, newer titles seem
generally ok with 8.1/XP/98 combinations but I swear we as in several
friends could Not get some semi-older titles to work under XP/8.1 at all
that use D3D..crashes, lockups, DX errors etc... I have faith in MS 'tho, I
think they'll get it right soon.
