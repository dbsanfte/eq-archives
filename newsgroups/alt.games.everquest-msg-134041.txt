Definetly not..

But, let me clear up a few misconceptions you might have.

I don't believe that having a HIV muppet is to promote the gay
lifestyle.

I don't have a problem with gay people or bi people ( I am married to
a bi person) or any hang up like that.

If my kids want to know about ANYTHING, they can ask us and we will
tell them a truthful answer.

My whole position on the Muppet issue is this:

Sesame Street was designed to teach the basics to toddlers.  ABCs.
123s.  Rudimentary social skills.

As such, an intristically complex medical/social issue such as HIV and
AIDs *SHOULD* fall outside the spectrum of SS's ability to adequatly
teach.

If it won't, then where does it end??

Will we soon see an Al-Qaeda Muppet???

What about a McVeigh Muppet??

Maybe a Stephen Hawking Muppet??

That is my position on the matter and no amount of name calling or
harassment or personal attacks (not you, I know...) will change my
mind on that.
