Ah... Ok. Alt-tab appears to not work with XP, as Ive got that installed on
my machine. I knew I would need to have the 2 characters on sperate
accounts, which they are, and my main pc is definitely "robust" enough to
handle it :) P4 2.4 Ghz 1GB ram, with a GeForce 4 4600 TI.

Ah well, looks like I need to do it the "old fashioned way" and simply level
the ranger up under her own power.

Thanks for responding :)
