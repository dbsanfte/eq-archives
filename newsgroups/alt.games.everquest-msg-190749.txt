I have absolutely had no lack of people asking me for ports since PoP
spawned

1.) the real ports - CS, WL, Luclin ports like TS and GF, various other
places people want to get to fast for raids, and they pay well
2.) the dumb/lazy ports - Nexus to Dawnshroud, nuff said
3.) the guild ports - ferrying people from raid target X to raid target Y
and thence to Z
4.) People without PoP

There are a few other minor circumstances.

Oh, and people generally donate about as much for PotG/9 as they do for KEI.

Not that is makes a big bulge in my bank account, as the junk I loot off
yard trash and sell to vendors in one day gets me more than ports do,
although I haven't really spent hours in nexus buffing so who knows. Exping
seems to me to be more beneficial overall for what you get from it.
