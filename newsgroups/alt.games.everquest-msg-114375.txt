  It depends on the guild's loot distribution policy.

  I personally don't like /randoming as a method of distributing loot on
guild raids.  I think it's great for pickup groups and open raids, but if
you're trying to equip your guild so it can raid more effectively, then
/randoming doesn't work as well as "need before greed" loot distribution in
most cases.

  It's just important that you're up front about the raid's looting policy.
If everybody knows NGB is the rule before the raid starts, and then someone
starts bitching about "deserving" an item more than someone else, then that
person is out of line (I get the impression that this is what happened).
Just the same as if a warrior starts bitching about deserving something on
the basis of NGB when everybody agreed beforehand that /random is how all
the loot would be distributed.

  You seem to like /random better, and that's fine, as long as you're in a
guild that distributes the spoils of a raid with /random.  The most
important thing is that some sort of policy is decided upon, clearly stated,
and then followed without exception.  No policy is going to be 100% even and
fair, but if you agree to a policy before the raid, you're obligated to
stick to it.
