Let's say you are partnering with another person who is higher level
than you.  You and your partner kill the mob, who cons green to your
partner but blue to you.  Would you get full exp from the mob as if
you were soloing?  Or does the game first split the exp as normal but
then not award exp to your partner after realizing it was a trivial
mob to him?  In such situations I've been told that I should have
gotten all the exp from the mob, but wondering if this is really true.


Similarly, what if a level 1 and a level 60 were grouped.  The level
60 kills a mob blue to him.  Would the level 60 get full exp?
