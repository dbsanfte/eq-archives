However, the number of agnostic necromancers would be e in the
minority anyway. Remember, the vilest and most evil of magics would be
learned and practiced mainly by those vile and evil enough to follow
the dark gods. Its unlikely that there would ever be the numbers
required to organize a school of agnostic necromancers. The "blackened
hearts" that would dabble in such things are easily swayed by the
promises of power offered by the dark gods.

My view, the religion selection represents what you start out as, or
at least pretending to be. 

As for not putting a crimp in the number of RN clerics, that's because
they attract a larger numbers. I also think that these schools of
necromancers would be far more concerned about the secrets of
necromancy falling into the hands of non-believers on a large scale.
