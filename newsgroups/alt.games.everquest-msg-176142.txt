A post on the everquest tech boards.Says they are considering a extremely
limited release to retail,but wouldn't be a cd just the account code.So as of
right now Ebgames and Gamestop have no agreement with Sony about anything.So
they are offering a product ,that currently doesn't exist and may never
exist.The only reason they are even considering a small release is for people
without access to credit cards.So before ordering from one of these sites,wait
for an official announcement from Sony and don't count on getting a cd.
