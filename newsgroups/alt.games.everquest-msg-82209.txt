I had absolutely *zero* to say to or in defense of the original poster. 
However, please killfile me.  I have no desire to see you wish death upon me
should I choose to complain about a *game*, and the chances of anything
useful coming from such a person are so slim as to appear nil.

Feel free to call me stupid while thinking my post was "sticking up" for the
original poster.  It makes me feel good.
