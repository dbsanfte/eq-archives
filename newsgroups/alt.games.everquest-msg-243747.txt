Actually, that sounds like it could be interesting if done right:
have some classes be under-utilised in early trials, so it's hard
to get through those trials with them, but make them so useful in
later content that people have an incentive to help get everyone
through the trials.  Seems to me that could create a new sort of
challenge.  "We really need a Shaman for this, but how are we going
to get a Shaman flagged to get this far?"

Then again, I have no experience with top-level content, so what do
I know? :)
