Well, here are the results of the un-scientific evergreen leaf dropping
test.

Retrieved it from the bank in Kaladim.
Dropped in bank = bag
Dropped outside bank = green spot
Dropped outside Tanned Assets = green spot
Dropped in outside gates of Kaladim in Butcherblock = green spot
Gated to GFay
Dropped in GFay in front of Felwithe = green spot
Dropped in front of bank in Felwithe = green spot
Dropped in bank of Felwithe = green spot

So it hit the ground as a green spot in almost every case ... except in the
bank where I first picked it up.

FWIW ......

Crash
