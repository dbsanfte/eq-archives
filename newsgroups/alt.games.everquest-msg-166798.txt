Indeed.  When I am fortunate enough to get to one of the Aqua Goblin
camps in Butcherblock with my low level cleric I am happy to alternate
pulls in the camp with someone.

That way we can have a chat, regain mana or whatever rather than have
one fellow sitting outside looking in wistfully whilst the other runs
around like a madman.

In camps such as this sharing works well, the loot is still decent
and, more to the point, it makes for a better game for all.  As far as
I see EQ; it isn't a race to get anywhere with any particular amount.
