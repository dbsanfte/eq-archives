He might mean the little boat (canoe) that usually stays at "Sister Isle" in
OOT.  If so, I have to say that a friend got that thing working once, but I
was never able to.  I did find swimming from Sister Isle to the nearby
islands pretty safe even at level 16 (not sure if there are supposed to be
sharks in the water).  Of course, you have to be careful once you get on the
various islands, but I was fine swimming.
