Yet another post that didn't go through.  Again, my apologies for doubling
up (if I did).

I was given 15 plat and taught how to bake.  With that 15 plat I got my
skill to 101 and was making the Fish fillets.  But the most that I ever made
in a day (on weekend mind you, baking all day - while I was meditating
between fights) was 200 plat.  And my fingers were numb and sore at the same
time (yes it's possible) from all that combing.  If someone baked for 1000pp
in one day, I'd REALLY like to know how.  What I remember of baking is
posted below, sorry for what I forgot, it's been some months since I've
baked.

Step 1 - Buy a Spit
Step 2 - Combine 1 Bat Wing and 1 Frosting until the skill is Trivial
Step 3 - Combine 1 Fish and 1 Jug of Sauces until the skill is Trivial
Step 4 - Combine 1 Fish and 1 Bat Wing until your skill is 101+  (Master
baker)
Step 5 - Return to Step 3 and sell to NPC vendors.

Spit is bought in East Freeport (the name of the store escapes me)
Bat Wings can be bought at the casters guilds or (I think) Inn #3 in East
Commons
Frosting Can be bought in one of the little huts next to Inn #1
Fish can be bought at the docks.
Jug of Sauces can be bought in one of the little huts next to Inn #1
