Unfortunately Jazz, it sounds like IBM did screw you over on that.  They got
a video card with the video connector positioned such that the normal full
size metal piece on the end could be swapped out for the one they used in
their system.  They did this to conserve space, but it does make it a
nonstandard AGP slot, in that you MUST replace the card only with another
card that has the video connector in the same relative area.  I would say
that unfortunately your best bet for keeping this machine, and upgrading it
is to use a PCI video card, if you have a PCI slot open, and it will accept
a standard PCI video card.  Three other less likely possibilities:

1.  Find an AGP video card that you can cut part of the metal piece off of
to make it fit, there are a lot of different ones out there, but I would
want to actually physically see it before purchasing if I were you.

2.  Call IBM, bend over, and see about purchasing a video card from them.

3.  Swap out way more parts than you want to, case and motherboard.

Good luck with this, and I'm sorry to see you going through all this pain
for a game.
