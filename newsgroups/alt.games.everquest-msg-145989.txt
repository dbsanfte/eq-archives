I lvled my cleric from 12 to 18  mostly solo or occasionally partnering with
a friend on Kerra Isle (just off tox). Not once did I see anyone else there.
Sure they cast stuff on you, never root/snare which is a blessing, but slow
which isnt much good for melee, but i think cure disease does for slow. Much
underused place. Outdoor zone with nice xp bonus.

with a full grp could easily do this zone at lower levels.
