I just downloaded it from the site.
Took over an hour.
I will try it out tonight and let you guys know what I think.
I think I will like it since I use to play D&D back when it first
started and wasted a year of my life.
Any sugestions on a first character or server?
I figure a human warrior to start should be simple although way back
in D&D days I was a half human half elf.
By the way I have never done online gaming before and my pc gaming
consists of Doom, Quake, Duke Nukem, C&C and a couple of others.
