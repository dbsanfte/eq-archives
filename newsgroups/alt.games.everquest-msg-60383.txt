    The problem being you'll never be able to tell which warriors have all
the defensive skills and which don't. The clerics might, but you sure won't.
8) Also, unless this is a triggered ability rather than a continuous ability
(in which case I bet it gets the flurry message), you'll never be able to
tell if they have Flurry, either.

    If it was triggered, it might not be too bad. Right now, one of the
biggest "learning curve" issues I see with young raiding guilds is focus
transitions. If a warrior had a way to increase aggro with Flurry without
losing Defensive, the transitions would be a little smoother. Now if only
the clerics in those young guilds stopped trying to heal the former focus
tank....
