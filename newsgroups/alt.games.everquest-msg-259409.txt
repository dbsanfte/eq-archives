There's lots of mana regen items (type 3, 7, and 8).  My gut feeling is buy
the augs.  But compare for yourself what each would cost.  For instance
there is a FT2 type 7 for 1450pts.  You could sell that many pts for 87kp
and buy a spiritmaster war beads which is also FT2 (based on my servers
pricing they are about that).  Or if you already have a neck item with
decent stats you could buy the aug and have both stats AND FT2.  Personally,
I have FT15 and 10 of it is augs.
