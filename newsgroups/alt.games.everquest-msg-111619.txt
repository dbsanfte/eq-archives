Hmm, ok, so I took off my mana items (forgot about them) and recast sow 22
times at lvl 33 with 124 wis, including one fizzle, in 240 secs.

That's almost 11 secs per cast. Anyway, divide 240 by 6  = 40.

33 *(2+124/5)=884.4  mana
884 + 40 = 924

40 * 21= 884

then there is the fizzle and I still had some mana left which would probably
account for the 40 mana difference. However, that must be some hefty loss
for a fizzle because, eyeballing the mana left, considering we're looking at
a fifth of a bubble for a cast of sow, there was nowhere near that amount
left.

Still, you must be right. :)
Thanks for that.
