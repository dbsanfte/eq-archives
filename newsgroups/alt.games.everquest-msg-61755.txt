  The impression I get is that proper use of the /report command can nail a
person to Verant's satisfaction without a staff member actually having to
witness the transgression, providing the individual is stupid enough to
admit their wrongdoing verbally, and you are astute enough to properly
/report them.

  It's a shame more people don't know about the /report command and how to
properly use it.  I really think this is something that ought to be covered
in the Tutorial considering how frustrating it is the first time you run in
to your first EQ asshole who you KNOW is breaking the rules, but you don't
know how quite to get them in trouble for it.
