Heh, read it again.  The bug they have not yet fixed is that the rez
timer does <not> always run when the player is off-line.  As Tim
pointed out, when "fixed" this could really discourage off-peak play
(especially for L52+).  Of course it might just make a nice market
for the occassional 3rd account cleric "rez whore", bouncing from zone
to zone with his 2nd account "port whore" and charging exorbitant fees
to the poor sod who got lagged (when they zoned in, of course :p) right
in the middle of a snakey pull.  (Actually I am kinda surprised, human
nature being what it is, that I haven't ever seen this.)

Disclaimer:  I pay for ports, I pay for rezzes, and tho I rarely refuse
compensation for performing a rez I never ask for, let alone demand,
anything.  If I'm willing to rez you I'm gonna rez you, donation/tip or
not, and if you ask "how much do I owe you?" my stock answer is
"nothing, but if you want to give me a gift I won't refuse it".
[Anybody else notice how the 30s and 40s nearly always offer 20pp to
50pp and always thank you profusely?  OTOH, the most likely person to
not bother even to thank you, let alone offer some compensation for your
time and trouble, but instead rants at you about how their death was BS
and they're gonna petition and etc., will be some 50+ hunting HGs for
cash?]
