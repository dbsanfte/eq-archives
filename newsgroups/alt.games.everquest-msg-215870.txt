    Look down the left hand column of the front page, and you should see a
section titled "spell lists" at the bottom. This lists all spells for the
given class, in level order, descending from level 65. It also lists some
spells that are flagged as belonging to a particular class which aren't
spells in game, so some caution must be used when reading from the list. But
overall, it's an excellent resource. Between Allakhazam's and Lucy, you
should never have to go back to Caster's Realm again. Which is a very, very
good thing, as CR is a steaming pile of turds. Lucy also has an excellent
item search engine, although for some reason they stopped updating the
database a short time before LDoN.
