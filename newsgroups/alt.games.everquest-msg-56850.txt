Oh? Well, I think EQ has caused more melancholy than what I would have had
to this day without EQ... Friends? I have REAL friends, I would prefer them
over some guy sitting around naked at a keyboard playing a bunch of pixels
that form a woman character. I have been cutting down alot on EQ in the past
few months to spend more time with real friends. I've lost best friends
before, wether they moved away or we grew apart after not talking much over
a few months, so dont go saying I'm new to that shit.
