The trick here is not the purpose the spells were designed for, but
rather what they can be used for. Tangling Weeds is inferior to snare
for snaring, Flame lick inferior to all your other spells for damage.

But. They both cast *fast* so you lose minimal melee damage from
interupted swinging, and they both debuff, so they have high aggro.

Flamelick debuffs ATK and AC (as does immolate), and Tangling Weeds
debuffs movement.

Finally, they both have paltry mana costs meaning they can be cast
over and over again - and thats the win. Where immolate might generate
more aggro *per cast* it costs a fortune in mana, and is a slower
spell to get off.

Depends on the weapon. I solely used a two hander at 65, but the
whole '2 hander for tanking' issue is largely irrelevant till the
later levels. Use the best quality weapons you can get, be they
one or two handed, for now.

That was more reminiscing ;) The trainmaker is an old old weapon now, you
dont want to hamstring your damage for a silly proc like root. Go find
the best weapons you can. I just recall my delight when I managed to buy
one for a 1000pp, at a time 1000pp was undreamt of wealth. I was finally
uber.

The next day I stripped snare with a proc in mistmoore and the pretty
armoured ancilles came to play. Ooops.

Learn which buffs you need - and ask for them, always. Generally you'd
want mana regeneration, haste, and AC/HP as a minimum. A 'full set'
would typically be: Haste, Cleric buff (temperance?), Shaman buffs (Sta,
Focus line), Enchanter mana regen, Self buffs.

Dont forget to maximise your attack too; wolf form, force of nature, etc
,etc, are your friends - not long till wolf form now, I think, and you
could always pick up a lupine dagger. The proc lasts a long time.

Getting you all killed, apparently ;) ;) ;)

It almst sounded like someone was using an AE spell and waking the
tranquil mobs, maybe an AOE song from the bard or nuke from the Wiz.

.... YOU'RE A HALFLING?

OK. Take back everything I said. The trick to getting aggro is running
naked and barehanded at the highest red con you can find.

*scowl*

Halfling rangers are the DEBIL!
