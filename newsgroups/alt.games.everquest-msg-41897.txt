And if you either can't find, or don't care for audio versions of works
like that, you can order (probably through amazon) the complete audio
transcripts of the radio series. Though I'd read all the books, I found
the differences entertaining and surprising.

Oh, allegedly someplace you can get videotape of the BBS production of
the first book for television as well, though it fell far short of the
books' promise given the limited budget and technology of the time.
