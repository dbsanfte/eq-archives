Unless you're swimming. Took me a while to figure out why my rogue
couldn't keep up to my cleric while on /autofollow in PoW.

On a relatively limited budget, the fungasbeast spine is usually
available in the bazaar relatively cheaply. With the 2(3?) disease dmg
it's about the cheapest 15 dmg piercer you can get and not to horribly
slow to boot.

Wish I hadn't ignored 1hb now, but it's unlikely my rogue will be
offered the Coirnav hammer any time soon anyway. I'm not sure about the
value of 1hs in the long run, doesn't it cap lower than piercing and 1hb
on rogues? But it's not hard to keep up. A centi short sword is a very
cheap, fast 1hs for keeping skill up as you level.
