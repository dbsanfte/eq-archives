It is, however, often an excellent idea for a caster to kite a snared
mob in tight circles near or around the group.  This is not the same
as "run around like a maniac", but it is also far different from
standing still.  It is also occasionally an excellent crowd-control
tactic, especially out of doors, when the kiter is fast or the mobs
are snared, I've seen a Druid keep a train of nine adds busy while the
group pulled them in to be killed one by one.
