Mages can summon a norent ring that gives up to 15% spell haste (except on
damage spells and heals, I believe).  I never summon it because the stats on
it (around +20hp, +20mana) are horrible for an upper level player and nobody
wants to give up their regular finger slot for it.  Getting a mage to summon
that ring may be a good way to test whether Spell Haste is going to make a
meaningful difference to your playstyle before investing thousands in a more
permanent item.  If you are in the bazaar, you may want to do a search on
"summoned" and see if anyone is selling Naki's Spiked Ring or Naki's Studded
Ring.
