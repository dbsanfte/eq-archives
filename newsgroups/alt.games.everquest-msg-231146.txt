Know this goes against the grain here but if I had it to do over again
I would not play EQ. Sony has not had one hit since they took over
game wise, SWG being the most famous example of boners. EQ has at its
heart a never ending supply of time sinks and now Im amazed that I
thought it was fun. EQ was great 3 years ago, now its lost any shine
it once had for me. Just because a lot of people play it doesnt mean
its the best out there, in fact its just as likely to mean its the
worst, number mean nada. So my advice is to look to the newer games
and find something else made by someone else. I did and am enjoying
gaming again, heh havent cursed SoE in weeks. Good luck have fun.
