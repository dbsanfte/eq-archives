The check would be raid wide... if anybody in the raid is still on
timer from a previous fight, when you try to agro... the check would
simply chuck out the names of the people on timer and not allow it to
be started.

>What about people that camp/LD before the event is completed?

Lockout timers go up every time you progress in the ring. In the case
of Statue/Idol/AoW... when you get Statue to 50% everyone gets shifted
to say 3 days.. then when Idol hits 50%.. 4 days.. then when AoW hits
50%, 5 days. Either that or just NO DROP his loot if you want to get
around the tradable item issues. Your timer for when you can restart
is then completely dependent on how far your raid was when you
LD/camped. If you LD'd just aftere Statue was engaged and came back
when AoW was 40% your timer would go to 5 days.

>If the people involved don't bother forming a raid, how do you determine
>who gets a lockout timer and who does not?

The agro gets locked to whoever agro'd. If that was a group.. only a
group can damage it.. if that was a raid.. only a raid. If it was a
single person trying to solo for some insane reason.. only they can
damage it.

Why isn't it? A lot of the timer stuff is the same as they're
currently using for instanced zones, just in a non-instanced
enviornment. Just carry it over.
