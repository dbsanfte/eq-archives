The Sarnak Broodlings tend to hover around the Cabilis area. If you
wind up below 4000 N/S, you've gone too far. They wander and do not
seem to have static waiting points, so you'll have to hunt them.

At level 18, there are plenty of places you can hunt for experience in
Lake of Ill Omen.  You can start hunting outside the fort around level
20 and *inside* the fort around level 22 with a sufficient group. By
level 30, you'll be looking to leave LOIO, since nearly everything
will be light blue or green to you.
