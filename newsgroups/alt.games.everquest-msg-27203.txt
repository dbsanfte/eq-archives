    I have two pet theories:

(1) He has an undiscovered quest, which one must use clues from the other
NPCs in the Temple to discover. Obviously hailing him won't work. ;-)
(2) He was placed in the Temple so that when it first opened, people who
went around hailing every NPC to get a spoiler of all the quests would be
forced to do faction work (Shadowed Men/Ortallius) to DO the quests.

    Guess which I believe the most.
