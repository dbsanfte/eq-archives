Not in a weapon slot, no. You use swiftwind for the atk boost while
using archery and get a haste item somewhere else. If you're meleeing,
put in a weapon who's ratio wasn't considered bad two years ago.

"Bad enough when the dead come walking," he said to Jon as they crossed
 the village, "now the Old Bear wants them talking as well? No good will
 come of *that*, I'll warrant. And who's to say the bones wouldn't lie?
 Why should death make a man truthful, or even clever? The dead are likely
 dull fellows, full of tedious complaints - 'the ground's too cold, my
 gravestone should be larger, why does *he* get more worms than I do....'"
