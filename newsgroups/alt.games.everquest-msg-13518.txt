That point (my credentials) was made in answer to the claim that mine
was "a staggeringly Naieve [sic] opinion." It demonstrated that, on
the contrary, mine was an informed opinion.

You have some definition of "script kiddies" that is wildly different
than mine? I'd just *love* to hear it.

You sure are hung up on that, aren't you? I'd never have guessed I
could have gotten so much entertainment mileage out of it when I
posted that.

>could show us a reliable source that defines it as such.

Maybe you'll accept the definitions from The Jargon File
http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/html/entry/script-kiddies.html

1. [very common] The lowest form of cracker; script kiddies do
mischief with scripts and programs written by others, often without
understanding the exploit they are using. Used of people with limited
technical expertise using easy-to-operate, pre-configured, and/or
automated tools to conduct disruptive activities against networked
systems. Since most of these tools are fairly well-known by the
security community, the adverse impact of such actions is usually
minimal.

2. People who cannot program, but who create tacky HTML pages by
copying JavaScript routines from other tacky HTML pages. More
generally, a script kiddie writes (or more likely cuts and pastes)
code without either having or desiring to have a mental model of what
the code does; someone who thinks of code as magical incantations and
asks only "what do I need to type to make this happen?" 

>More backpeddaling. Why am I not surprised?

Your lack of ability to read a thread does not constitute
back-peddling on my part, no matter how desperately you would like to
pretend that it does.
