If you look at the in-game description of each combat ability it will tell
you which axe type you need to use it.  For the first set of abilities
(snare, stun, diversive strike) it's Blunt Axe, and it does not have to be
in range slot, just in inventory.  It gets a bit confusing though, since you
need a different axe type for the next stun effect, but you still have to
keep blunt axes on hand to use snare and diversive strike until you get the
upgraded versions of each.  And of course you get an upgrade to the axe
you'll actually want to throw every few levels, too.  So I end up with a
stack of blunt axes in inventory for snare and diversive strike, a stack of
the axe which I am currently using for the stun effect (the name escapes me,
maybe Bonesplicer) also in inventory, and yet another type of axe to use for
actually throwing, since the range goes up along with the damage and delay.
Good thing I play an enchanter most of the time, I am used to having more
abilities than I know what to do with.

The upgrade that made berserker snare have a set duration was a very, very
welcome change.  Before that it would break at random and was almost useless
because it could break after 2 seconds, with a 12 second re-use timer, the
runner would have already brought friends by the time it refreshed.  As to
the range, I'm pretty sure the effect will work from the range of the axe
that is used for that particular ability, i.e. blunt axe for the lowest
level one.

At my berserker's skill of 160 or so, frenzy doubles almost every time, and
occasionally triples.  I have no idea what the damage is based on, since all
my weapons have about the same base damage.  The actual hits are much higher
than 20; frenzy falls under the "under-level-20" damage cap.

Intimidate really is painfully slow to raise.  I think mine is still under
20 and it has worked exactly three times.  I find that weapon skill ups are
very slow as well, which is exactly the opposite of all my defensive skills
and throwing skill, which go up very quickly and are all capped.
