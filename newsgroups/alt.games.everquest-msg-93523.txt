   Test server.  Then FV, then the Zeks.  But all these
have certain conditions to them that might not make 
them your first choice.
    By the way, I don't understand the premise of your
question.  Other players are a _large_ part of the whole
experience.  I wouldn't want to play on server where
there were 500 people fighting in Ecomms, nor one where
there were only 5.
