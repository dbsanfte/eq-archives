Frankly, I think it's just a combination of trying to discourage people
from trading or selling characters, and gouging.  They picked a price where
most avid players would still fork over the dough to move a character,
but discouraged newbie EQ players from buying, say, a lvl 15 character for
$75 because the costs are too high for the creator of the character.

There's no way an operation such as this could take 20 minutes.  10 minutes
max, and that's assuming there's little automation in the process.
