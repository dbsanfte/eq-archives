I used to always be wary around halfling druids before because of the drOOd
syndrome, but I suspect I have met more dewdish Iksar monks over the last
year than other particular class.

It gives true newbies a chance to get into Dungeons and acquire gear. Gear
and personal knowledge is the key to EQ and it is hard for us with out
twinking ability both of knowledge and gear to gauge how it would be for an
absolute Newbie. A lot of casual players must have been put off over the
years purely because of the overbearing difficulty. Let's face it - you only
have to read the sleepers thread up the page to realise a few more casual
players sprinkled around could only be a good thing : )

I think thats what they are trying to address with better stuff availiable
earlier on in the expansions. The old world is wall to wall full of crap
which is useless by the time you can get it and I have always thought it was
just plain dumb. I suspect the ones who complain loudest about stuff like
the Neth' Chitin (ie: stuff which is good at the level you can get it) are
the ones who make a killing farming stuff to sell lowbies and they are just
worried there market is drying up.
