Hiya,

everyone owns a keyring right from the beginning ...

And sorry, dont think it went directly to your keyring ... normally keys are
added with the first use of it ...

To verify what rings are on your keyring (so you can delete them physically)
type /key and look which keys are added ...


Have fun in game

Christian
