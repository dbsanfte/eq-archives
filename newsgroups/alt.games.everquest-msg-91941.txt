EQPrices can still be used for a basic price-check if you can narrow the
search down enough. Personally I don't bother anymore... since they went
'premium' I 've found their prices are way off in most cases and getting
worse by the week (guess the smaller number of users is messing with the
averages).

I've never used EQmaps myself... I'm happy with EQAtlas and I've paid for
Allakhazams premium service... prices are just as bad as EQPrices, but
getting better rather than worse... quest are the best for general searching
(some of the class-specific sites have better detail for their own quests).

Overall, my advice would be to shop about and make sure the extra features
are worth the subscription.
