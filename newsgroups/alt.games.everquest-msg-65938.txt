Wait up to 15 minutes, port to nexus, walk to the other port, wait
a definate 15 minutes, port back down.

Thats one port per continent, which isn't a big deal in the case of
the Tox, of course... but only about a quarter the time when I port
to Kunark do I use the DL port (EJ, Skyfire, and my personal
favorite, Firepot to Cabalis,) the port to GFay is certainly a popular
one, although I usually take BB or Steamfont, got a lot of druid
friends... and the NK port is Brell's own joke on anyone wanting to
go to Antonica, -is- there a zone further from a city?

Ports aren't desired because its impossible to get anywhere
without one, they are desired because they are convenient
and fast ways to travel.  With an average of 22 minutes transit
time, the nexus round trip might as well be a boat ride!
