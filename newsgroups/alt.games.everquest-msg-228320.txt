I would never suggest that. I was referring to the player's own
responsibility for his *own* well being, not for others. In direct
response to the newbie standing in a place where he would get killed -
though I wouldn't have designed it so it was necessary for the newbie
to do so in the first place. Multiple levels of not happening. :-p

There's a world of gamey players who put themselves right in harms way
and then are shocked someone would take advantage of it... and then
complain about it. :-)

That may in the end be necessary (not the shooter part). Or a
completely different sort of advancement for both, and not necessarily
personal.

I would not say "it isn't". Developing your character is a core
function of rpg.

By basing achievement on skill, especially tactical. This requires a
very deep combat system.

Note I don't say twitch skill; I believe that would actually defeat
the purpose.

Note also that I think the only way to do this would be to make it
virtually impossible for someone solo to kill anyone. That's the price
of reducing the gankage. And finally the objective for killing must
not be the kill itself - the kill needs to be a means to another end.

I haven't said that at all; the PvE of such a game would just have to
be rather different than it is in EQ style games today. Gamey and
worldly design basics do not really mix that well; hence why the
worldly people dislike instant portals everywhere while the gamey love
it, for example.

That can be resolved through a system of diminishing returns, where
the bigger you get the harder it is to maintain - one of the ways SB
failed was it had absolutely no nod towards this whatsoever, and the
same could be said for the RvR portion of DAoC to a smaller extent.
Note this works in PvE too, while maintaining a worldly set - it
simply means the AI and scripting of the game engine would have to be
far stronger than EQ, and perhaps any other mmorpg, are to date.

Take Horizon's undead invasions, for example. If it actually works
(kinda early to make that call), it could be an awesome worldly
addition, where the undead are slowly but surely blasting away the
player possessions forcing them to act against it in a dynamic
fashion. Now it may not happen that way, I can't make that call yet
nor can anyone else for probably months. But it *could*.

Remember some of this depends on other elements being present; it
can't be nickelled and dimed down. Mmorpgs are holistic beings - they
have to be regarded as how well all their parts work together, not on
the merits of each part.

That would be actually accomplishing it. I don't hold him to *that*;
merely to acknowledge that it can be done... if the impetus was there,
and that right now the problem is that the EQ clones have taken over
and, like the warcraft clones in the rts department and the doom
clones in the fps genre, no one is willing to risk stepping outside
the box, and we the gamer suffer for it (unless of course you are so
happy with what you are playing you could never play anything else).
