I haven't even been to Velious yet.  Just the thought of the trip there is
scary to me.

I was more of Wolfensteiner/DOOMer than a Descenter.  The german shepards in
Wolfenstein and the little pink guys in DOOM scared me more than any of the
big baddies.  They always seemed to jump out at ya when you weren't
expecting it.
