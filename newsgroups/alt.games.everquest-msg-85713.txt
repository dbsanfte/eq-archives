Well, Rune III absorbs 230hp, versus 700hp off Rune V... And
at the level where you can cast V, expect to be hit for more
than that in a single round... Not much to be gained from it
at all then...

BTW, the certain limited situations Dan is alluding to is, I
believe, boss mobs with interesting procs like life taps and
such. If the mob doesn't actually do damage to the tank, the
proc doesn't go off, so if the enchanters keep the main tank
Rune'd all the time, the fight will be that much easier.

Rune I (I only absorb 55hp, but I'm low maintenance!)
