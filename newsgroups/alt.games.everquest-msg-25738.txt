from there are links to our members list (about 80% have signed up there)
from an Html stand point the site isnt a pro job but our leader made it and
he is a busy man,
i agree with the others never join a guild doing /shout Invites group with
them get to know them. people will remember you in this game.espicially the
higher in levels you go, im at the point where i cant zone without saying hi
to 4 or 5 people i know. some of which i may not have seen in 10+ levels.
pay attention to peoples guild tags when you see them as well as there
names.

why camp your g/f's parents when you can camp you g/f =)
