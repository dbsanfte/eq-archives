I play a ranger.  Until I got my own strength spell, I had to get used to
seeing "You are encumbered" in red every time I took a few steps.   Rangers
have pitiful strength especially if they are made by someone like me who
didn't know that I'd need some strength and put points in totally useless
areas.   Not being encumbered means we can swing our weapons better and
faster, we can run to zone when we get in trouble, all good things.  I
stopped looting for a long time, couldn't carry one more thing, my armor
weighed me down so much.  Have a heart and cast some strength on your poor
ranger.
