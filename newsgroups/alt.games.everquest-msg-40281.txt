You're a lot braver than I when my first two characters were 5th level.  At
5th level, my first character (Barb Warrior) thought he was being bold and
daring just to approach the entrance of Blackburrow.

At 5th level, my second character (Human Cleric) was amazed just to sit at
the docks in South Qeynos and watch the ships come and go as he tried to
fish for his food.  The first big, brave, scary thing he did when he really
first started adventuring was to dare to step aboard that ship and let it
sail off with him on board.  That was before I knew what to expect once I
got to the continent of Odus.  It was the Bardic Mail Run that changed his
life :-)

West Karana?  At level 5?  My first two characters?  Ha!  I was shaking in
my boots just to get to the Brothers' Tree.  (of course, back then, people
on my server seemed to be regularly training Ogres, Cyclopses, and bandits
to the QHills/WKarana zoneline!)
