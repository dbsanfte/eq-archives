Ahh.. But you just changed the meaning of the word didn't you.
If I (and by no means am I black in any way) went into a bar in..well
you said Oakland but I'll take it up a notch or 2 and say the
shoreline crips area of Venice and said "what's up with my niggers" ,
more than likely I would get some looks, but I might even get some
"what's up fool" in return. But if I was to go into the same bar and
shout "niggers" in a threatening manner ,sure as shit I'd get a pool
cue to the head and I'd deserve it.
But if an "average white guy" walked into a bar in O-town ( assuming
whites never go to this bar ) and did shout "nigger" more than likely
the patrons would think he's crazy or on crack and throw him out.
Why you always seem to think blacks resort to violence first beats the
shit out of me.
And no, that does not make you a racist, just misinformed or maybe you
yourself have had a bad experience in life, I don't know. But no DT, I
am not calling you a racist in any way. lets get that straight.
