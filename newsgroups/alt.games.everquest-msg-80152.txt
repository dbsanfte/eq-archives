Yeah specifically on the soufire evidently the people who won test of
tactics actually went to the trouble of questing for 4 or 5 soulfires
(one each) to complete heal during the test of tactics (though they
were not paladins) Thats just kind of sad really and so very ghetto.
Of course they won.

Ghoulbane was changed to no drop both for farming and so the pally
would have to quest/kill the mob himself for his holy sword (course
can always get twink help on it)
