And how would that happen?

You think TCC would force people to go into Kaesora at the
"appropriate" level?  What dreamland are you in?

Kaesora is empty because it's a stupidly designed zone.  The
risk/hassle vs. reward is broken.

Implement TCC in Kaesora the following will happen:  NO ONE will be in
Kaesora.  The only people who would bother showing up in Kaesora would
be those high level babysitting mid levels so they can get the fang
for Charasis.

Yeah, instead of actually fixing the broken zone they should slap on
this idiotic TCC instead.

Sounds peachy.  Bye.
