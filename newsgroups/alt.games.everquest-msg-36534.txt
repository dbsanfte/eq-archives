Actually, I'd love to see some truly gigantic creatures in, say, South
Karana, even if they aren't worth fighting and are there just for color.

I had this idea... As a resolution to the "cursed Karana planes"
storyline, there should be some kind of pitched battle, finishing with
the recapture and cleansing of NK, WK and EK, and the utter loss of SK.
The mobs in SK would become strange, mutant, diseased versions of their
former selves, the texture set changed to something truly sick, and the
entrance to the Plane of Disease (with old Bert himself sitting there)
planted in the middle. Splitpaw could be changed again to something even
more high-level.
