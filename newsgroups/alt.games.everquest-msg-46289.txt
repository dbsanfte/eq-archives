Nightblind Human/barbarian.

Also could likely pull it off on Feydwer with language options of
gnome/dorf/elf for some variety.  Language would be dicey, but faction
should be adequate. I'm thinking CLE/War Dorf dru/Rog wood-elf and
Mag/enc Highelf or Gnome.  with that configuration, it would be feasable
to level to 5 as a duo and then group up for language stuffs.
