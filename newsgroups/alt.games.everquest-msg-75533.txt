Long before you try an OS that demands more resources you should try
reformatting your HD and reinstalling everything from scratch.  Use the
money you were going to spend on XP on a video card that supports T&L.

And read Valien's response.

Keep in mind that a lot of people with W2k and XP have sound problems with
EQ...though Valien's response may solve that problem as well.
