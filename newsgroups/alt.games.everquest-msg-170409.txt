You don't need sense heading to know which direction you are going, just
looking at locs will tell you that within a few steps.  My sense heading is
maxed, but only because it's on my /loc hotkey.  My compass has not been
displayed on my screen for some time now, at one point I accidentally closed
the window, and never bothered to find out how to get it back.  I learned
how to use /loc, because sense heading was not reliable enough at low
levels.
