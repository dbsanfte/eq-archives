I go out of my way to help every cleric I see. If I asked for a buff and
didn't get it, the -last- thing I would do would be anything that might
piss that cleric off. These idiots have just guaranteed that at least one
cleric on Norrath will never heal/buff or, more importantly, rezz them.

The response to this is "You will never be healed, buffed, grouped with,
or rezzed by me, or any of the clerics I have a chance to mention your
name to".

No reason for you to accept the duel. /decline followed quickly by /ignore
works best.
