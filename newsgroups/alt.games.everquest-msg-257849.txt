Hello!

Today I downloaded and installed the 30 days trial version of Everquest.
Before I registered online. But I have technical problems. Shortly after
choosing the server and pressing the login button, the screen freezes and I
have to reboot the computer. Has anyone a solution for this problem?
I read that the sound machine could cause that effect. So I disabled the
sound but the same problem occured again.
I have a 2.53 GHz Pentium 4, GeForce Ti 4200 and an Audigy 2.


Best regards,
Marc
