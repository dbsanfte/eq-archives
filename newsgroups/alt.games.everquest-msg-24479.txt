Nope, doesn't work on my box.  I cannot get back in at all, although the EQ
window does have the focus per the taskbar.

Ugh, this is really a pain.  With all of the server side checks that they
have this seems to be more of an inconvenience to players rather than a
hacker deterrent.  Verant, if you are listening, please allow for
alt-tabbing for no other reason than to check mail during the 15 minute
medding sessions.  Or, at least to play Tetris until Gems is updated :)
