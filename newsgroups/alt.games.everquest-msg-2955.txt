I'm on the Zeb server now and we're getting lots of true newbies because
Verant - in all their stupid wisdom - decided to make us a "green" server.

Thank god I love true newbies. :)

I saw yet another level 1 character walking so I sent him a tell letting him
know, and to hit the Run button.  He replied that he knew about the Run
button.  My response was joking that I never knew anyone who WALKED by
choice, but I logged off before he could type his 10wpm response so I didn't
get his reason.

Usually people are walking because they forgot to hit Run, are seriously
encumbered, near death or on a raid where folks tend to have Fear cast on
them.  The only thing I can think of is that someone gave this newbie a lot
of coin (I'm hoping copper).
