I had it in EQ1. Before I quit, the last two series of 
patches played havoc with my FX5950. If you were anywhere 
near places with torches, and there are a lot of places with 
them, you would get horizontal banding moving up and down 
the screen. As you say, it doesn't happen in any other game. 
I Flight Sim a lot and video there is as close to perfect as 
you can probably get. Simply can't justify $6-800 for a new 
video card only a year into a new system. Guess I'm not a 
"true" gamer.
