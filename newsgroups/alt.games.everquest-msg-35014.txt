Hi, this is my first time in this group. Im kind of curious, how old is the
average person who plays the game? Im also curious if theres any link
between
charecters levels, and age. Like, do older people get higher charecters
before
losing interest in the game (like thats possible, lose interest in everquest
haha)

I am 22 years old and my charecter is a level 31 human warrior (almost 32 if
i
didnt die because of a stupid train...grrr) Oh im also curious how long it
took
people to get to thier level. You can find out by using the /played command.
I
dont remember the exact time for me, but its somewhere along the lines of 12
days and 10 hours. What about everyone else?
