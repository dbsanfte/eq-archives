My 35 Pally was wandering around where he shouldn't have been all by himself in
Mistmoore.  He was back by what looked like a graveyard and then entered a
little one room building.  He fell down a hole in the floor and now he can't
find any way out of this room.  It's the same area where the no drop flower is
on top of the casket.  Anyone know if there is any way out of this trap?
