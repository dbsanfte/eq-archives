This may or may not be an exploit - it'll depend on how effective it is, how
widely it gets used, and the mood of the GM who sees it.  There have been
other tactics that involved getting xp/loot from mobs killing each other
which have resulted in suspensions, permakilled mobs, and code changes.

Describe the tactic, so we can have a better sense of requirements (and maybe
even help refine it, or let you know whether it's been deemed an exploit or
not).

There aren't many mid- or high-level zones with guards that work this way, for
obvious reasons.  Have the lizards outside CT greened out to you?  Ogre guards
should fight them.  Likewise the spectres outside PoFear.  Both are a bit of a
pull, though.  Cyclopses in OOT, maybe as well.

Nor I.  FG may work for you, though.

Depending on your plan, you may not need memblur.  One standard charm tactic
is to make 2 things fight, break charm when both are near death, nuke off the
remaining HP for full XP on both.
