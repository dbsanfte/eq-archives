I know the tactic, however it's very easy to get tossed, have him turn
to another, toss that stupid fling, and everyone goes to hell and
back.

Basically, with Vyemm, it's not so much aggro control as mob
placement.  Once he's in position, he's drop dead easy.  Out of
position, chances of getting screwed is pretty good.
