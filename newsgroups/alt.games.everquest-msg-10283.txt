The same way you stop any addiction. There are 3 methods pretty much:

1) Weaning. In this method you slowly play less and less until you are
playing not at all. Its similar to quitting smoking and how you smoke
less and less and are soon wearing a patch. Like smoking though you
may have backslides. A good way to help this is to be in some kind of
a support network, though real life people might playing will probably
not identify with you being wrapped up in a "video game" while they
would with you having a smoking/drinking problem. 

2) Replacement. This is simlar to weaning but rather than slowly
quitting so much you find something better. Anarchy Online is out soon
and some time much later dark ages of camelot. 

AO especially has many anti downtime devices by design while eq of
course has MANY downtime devices by design. I think part of EQ's
problem is that the downtime and camping devices make the game even
MORE addictive since you keep trying to accomplish something and the
game holds you back. My take on it is that though I might replace my
addiction to EQ with AO, AO will be a much "healthier" addiction since
I will get my fix in a much shorter amount of time due to such things
as quests you can just do, generated on the fly, for you or a group of
friends with a key which take place in an area just for you. EQ Is
more like a drug where you keep needing more to sustain a high. 

The undesireable part of this method is that even though AO may be
less addictive since you accomplish more, you may just end up
replacing one addiction with another.

Playing single games instead might help also.

3) Cold Turkey. This is one of the harder methods of curing your
addiction but unlike drugs or drinking, EQ makes it easier in one way;
you can just delete all your chars and cancel then uninstall the game
while breaking the CD into small pieces. Usually a person's characters
are part of the addiction so as long as they are waiting in the wings
you will keep coming back. You need to have the will to totally put a
stop to your ability/incentive/need to play. 

As part of quitting cold turkey, or any of these methods you should
also quit visiting this newsgroup, ever. Remove all links to EQ sites
in your webbrowser. Stop going to any EQ sites or the main everquest
site. Reading other people talking about your addiction will not help
you get over it.

Its really hard to quit something like smoking this way, but should be
much easier to do so with EQ.



I'm addicted also to this type of game. I say this type of game
because I don't think I'm addicted to EQ per se. I will likely go the
replacement route via Anarchy Online. 

From my personal experience another good way to at least make the
addiction healthier is to branch out and get several addictions at
once. I'm not talking about drugs or stuff, but get into several other
things which you "Have to" do. For me I've gotten into certain TV
shows which I have to see and will immediately quit out of EQ for to
go and watch for a few hours. Getting into a certain books or book has
the same effect (those paper things with written words in them which
tell a story...) Getting out of the house to see a movie or something
instead of playing EQ helps also.
