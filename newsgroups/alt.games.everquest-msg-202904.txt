I've only been playing for a month and was unaware that KEI was a "bug". My
17 Druid found out about KEI at lev 10, and since he solos most of the time,
he thought it was very nice. The four plains of Karana are a great place for
a Druid in his/her teens, jacked up on KEI. On Prexus at least, the plains
are almost always empty of other players and loaded with all levels of MOBs.
It was a great deal of fun romping around practicing my Druid skills and
tactics. Last night I got on and found out the party is over. My beloved 17
Druid is boring as hell. I don't normally have the tv on when I'm playing
but last night I did and needed it because my Druid spent a great deal of
time on his butt.

I'm putting him away today and starting a new char, one with grouping
potential since low lev Druids have very little if any.  Maybe and
Enchanter. Anyway, I still have two months to go on a three month access
card. I haven't decided if I'm going to get another card or just take the
game off my box. I don't pay sony to watch tv, that's what I pay the cable
company for.

From reading the posts here I'm sure that a lot of you will be saying  to me
"good bye, good riddance." And in all fairness, perhaps I do have a short
attention span, and I need a game that provides a lot of stimulation in
order the keep me interested. And if it turns out that 50% of EQ gameplay is
sitting on your butt waiting to med, than this is definitely not the game
for me and I will take my money and go play someplace else.

One last point, I've been reading a lot of post blabbing about "the old
days". I just want to say I Don't Care About The Old Days!!!!! The game I
signed on to and pay for is not "the old days" game. When I was a child my
parents used to bore me with stories about walking to school in mile high
snow with no shoes on, etc. etc.. I didn't care then and I don't care now.
