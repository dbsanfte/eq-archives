No Ted, it is an observation.  There is nothing hypothetical involved.
How can you claim these regimes were "fittest" in a survival context
in the face of their failure to survive?  A particular government's
military might is only one of many resources a culture can use in its
struggle to survive.  That is rather clearly demonstrated by the
continuing survival of the peoples and cultures governed by your
examples in spite of the utter defeat of the governments themselves.
