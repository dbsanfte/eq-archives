Ahh, excellent point. I had completely forgotten how much anticipation I had 
about that exact aspect of the game. I made a number of friends in TSO who 
didn't fit the demographics usually associated with online gamers (I won't 
start a flamefest here with some obvious stereotypes, readers are encouraged 
to use their imagination). During my final days there I tried recruiting 
some of them to come join me elsewhere and I remember not getting many 
takers because of the bad experience they'd had there. Damn.

Yeah, add that one to the list.
