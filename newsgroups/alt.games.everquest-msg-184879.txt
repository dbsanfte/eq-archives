I have to question the use of going to a site where the very first thing 
in the FAQ (cleric version, at least) is:

Q: I read that at level 35 you no longer have to look at your spellbook 
to meditate. If this is so, then how is it accomplished? Can you just 
sit, or do you have to hit the meditate button and the hit the F10 key? 
A: Yes, you heard correct. At level 35 all you need to do is sit with 
the sit/stand key and you will auto-meditate. Its as simple as that.

I was shocked when they first started asking people to pay a 
subscription price.  Ally updates may be slow sometimes, but at least 
they're there.
