Absolute bullshit.   I don't remember the exact name of the post, but Sean
Kennedy ran the numbers when the expansion came out.   Killing the same mobs
(with one exception) you will lose about 10 to 15 percent of the experience
from being higher level (Search for the post if you want the exact numbers)

A level 70 killing level 66 targets will make AA's faster than a level 65
killing level 61 targets.

The only exception is if the *only* targets you kill are between level 60 and
64.   At 65 you would be getting high con bonus (about double normal exp) for
them, and at level 70 you would not.

When you become over 5 levels above your chosen target.
