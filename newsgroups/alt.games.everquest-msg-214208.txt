I dunno. Personally, if spending time with friends and acquaintances
enjoying a relatively intense part of an online game isn't incentive
enough for someone to pitch in whenever they can, I couldn't care less
if they're not there. On the other hand, putting too strong of an
incentive to attend as many raids as you can only encourages people to
put off more important RL matters.
