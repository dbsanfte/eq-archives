Your reputation is far more valuable than any experience or loot you
might get from the camp, and the higher level you get the more this is
true.

The first thing you should do when you get to a spot you want to camp
and there are people there is talk to them and see if you can work
something out.  You're much better off asking if you can join their
group, or if they are full ask if they would send you a tell if a spot
opens up for you.  If this isn't an option then you can ask them to
send you a tell when they are finished, and go find something else to
do while you wait.  After a while if they haven't sent you a tell you
might go check and see if they are still there.  You can also ask if
they would mind sharing, but from my experience this usually doesn't
work out as well as finding somewhere else to go until they finish.

Most people are going to find it rude if they are getting ready to
break a camp and somebody comes in and starts pulling from it right
before they are ready to start.  Not that it's against the rules
according to Verant, but it's just not a very nice thing to do. At
least not without talking to them first.

Later in the game most people need to group to be able to accomplish a
lot of things.  If you get a bad reputation it's going to make it
harder to find a group.

Also, if you plan on getting to the upper levels of the game you are
probably going to consider joining a guild at some point.  From my
experience most of the good guilds check a person out before they
invite them.  If they start checking around and you have a bad
reputation you probably won't get in.  If there is somebody in the
guild that has had a bad experience with you your chances of getting
in is even worse.

If you are on a server that does public raids, your reputation can
also keep you from be welcome on these raids.  If you've done
something in the past to piss off the raid leader, or any of their
friends, you may find that they don't want you on the raid.

Quite a few people keep lists of who the rude/bad players they have
met are for future reference.  Basically, what I'm saying is that life
later in the game is much easier and enjoyable if you stay off of
these lists.

If you don't mind being disliked, enjoy being disliked, or you just
like making things more difficult for yourself, please disregard
everything above this line.
