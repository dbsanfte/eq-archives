AAHAA first thought entering my head was, "porn.." Ahahha I am naughty

I heard of the same thing and like you did I thought, "My, that is
purposeless.. hmmm porn?"

I remember something similar long ago, with the excellent text
adventure "Leather goddesses of phobos" with smell o vision (a scratch
and sniff card, bahaha.) This just sounds ilke an upgraded version of
that. One major hurdle to this is they just can't make things smell
right. If they try to make it smell like the fresh outdoor scent of
the woods it will instead smell like an evergreen cheesy car
airfreshner hanging from the mirror thing. It would be KIND of cool if
it was automatic but from what you say about sliding in scented things
makes it sound like you have to do it manually. In that case you get
the same effect a lot cheaper by getting a myriad of air freshners and
spraying the appropriate one at the right time, "Ah.. time for
Sea-Breeze!"
