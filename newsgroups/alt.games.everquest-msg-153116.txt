Actually the parts I was annoyed by was that first the first reply suggested
using a program which is in all cases I can remember, suggested for the
purpose of running EQ as well as running something else, which I said
couldn't be done in this case.  Second, they didn't look as if they were
suggesting what was (much) later brought up, the idea of using scheduled
tasks to start and then later stop EQW.  Third, I simply asked if they had
read the whole post.  I even began my reply in such a way as to hopefully
NOT get the type of responce I got.  Something more along the lines of "They
might be suggesting using EQW to start EQ, then use something else to close
it." rather than "well if you werent so busy trying to get all pissy".
Fourth problem was that this reply went on to appear as if they did even
less reading, as they suggested EQW for the purpose of browsing the web or
other things which can't be done when you're not there.  They also went on
to state that I can't shut down EQ because that would cause me to
disconnect, something which I can not do.  I was sure I had been clear that
this was my intention, NOT to stay on, but to shut down EQ at a specific
time.  Then last, notice how neither of the first two replies ever came back
to state what they were reffering to, to better clerify what they said or
meant?  One thing I really dislike is someone who gives a seamingly random
answer that sounds like it has to do with the situation, just giving the
answer for the purpose of giving an answer, even if not the correct one
(more like a random number generator).  The reasons I mentioned above go to
suggest that this may have been what they did.
