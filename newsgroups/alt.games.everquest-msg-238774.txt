Alright, here's the sotry:

I was going through the EB the other day and they had a number of
copies of EQ:Trilogy still available for $9.99.  I have a couple
friends I was thinking of getting to join the game, and I was thinking
this might be the road to go:

Pro's
1)  Cheaper overall cost

2)  Old world zones.  Mostly unpopulated.  Not as much to worry about
trains.  Grouping might be a prob, but the idea is to group together.

3) Slower learning curve.  See this is the big one.  If I wanted them
to catch up to my main. I could see getting evolutions, but that isn't
the point.  Most of the other RL people they know who play have been
playing since Release, and we've got some decent skills to back it up.
A slower learning curve might help them learn how to play a bit
better.

4) No PoK stones.  They might learn they lay of the land a bit better.

5) New UI, downloadable zones, tradeskill UI all available to trilogy
only players.

Cons
1) No bazaar.  So it's harder for them to get uber gear, and make plat
selling off the usually newbie farmed stuff

2) No PoK stones.  They might get pissed off at the long travel times.
I can see this being a deal, especially for boats.

3) Slower xp curve. Hmmm, well, with the right zones in Old World and
Kunark, you can still get to 40-50 pretty easy.  HHK ios still there,
and there's plenty of unoccupied dungeons with a decent zem.  Maybe
it's a slower perceived xp curve.  Scratch this off the list.

4) No automap. They might have to use loc and sense-heading.  Not a
horrible hardship either.

Anyways.  I'm thinking Trilogy might be a better option, both for the
people I want to join and for me.  Rather than releasing a couple more
clueless newbie twinks on the gameworld.  

'Sides, if they do find that they like it, they can snag evolutions
and the other expansions on their own.  Heck, I'd probably tell them
to get LDoN first, and then have some fun in there too.

Any thoughts?
