I'm guessing that the only reason you ever heard of it is that you did
a web search on my name to try to find a violation.

Now, here's the beauty of the name rules. By reporting someone, all
I've done is report them. I haven't got any power in the matter. It's
up to a GM to decide if something truly does constitute a violation.

Here's what you do then - if you see someone with the name Lokari
running around in the game, report it. Explain to the GM that it's the
name of a plastic sheeting company on the southwestern coast of
Finland, but that the company name isn't *really* Lokari, it's "Leo
Laine Oy". Once you get done with all that it'll be up to the GM to
actually render a decision.

And if the GM should, by some freak chance, agree with you, then the
poor sot running around with the name Lokari will get it changed. It
won't affect me, however, as I don't have any active characters with
that name.
