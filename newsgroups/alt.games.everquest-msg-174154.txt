Not surprisingly, Dan the Oil Man completely fails to answer a single
part of the post, instead resorting to insults and poopooing whatever
he doesn't agree with.

Dan the Oil Man is the perfect example of a biased individual with a
closed mind. Learn from his example, as "what not to be like".

I thought it was worth a try, since providing you with facts doesn't
seem to work.

This is Dan the Oil Man-speak for "damn that stuff really hurts my
case so I'll pretend it isn't relevant".

No, they don't, Dan. Sorry, Dan, but the Kurds aren't any better off
now than they were before. Of course, they're getting brought up again
now as its time to make use of the propoganda, right Dan? You're
really into that propoganda, aren't you Dan? Do you distribute it to
your neighbors, Dan?

The point is the cause the American government promised the Kurds in
90 and earlier has been utterly dropped. Only some half assed efforts
to fulfill promises made during the war were even started. Nothing new
has been attempted, and as far as the Kurds are concerned the
Americans have betrayed them.

Remember the names you were so proud of, Dan? Do you remember seeing
them talking about American promises of support for their new state,
Dan? How come we don't see this state, Dan?

Not just that, Dan, but also proof of what the US offered the Kurds in
'91, things that have not yet been provided despite ample opportunity
to do so, Dan.

Somehow I knew you'd jump at the chance to bash Clinton, Dan. You've
made your polarized political views about as obvious as possible. How
much did you donate to the Republicans this year, Dan?

I don't see that separate Kurdish state, Dan. What was done in 96 was
a brutally flubbed half assed attempt of saving face, and as all
attempts like that, it went nowhere.

The Kurds aren't always forgotten, Dan. They are brought up whenever
propoganda is needed.

Is there a Kurdistan in your world, Dan? I don't see one in mine. Do
you forget what the Kurdish support was for, Dan?

Not a strawman, Dan, just a demonstration of contempt for your sad
ignorance of the world.

Just like the public promises in 91 and earlier, Dan.

You are treated with the respect you deserve, Dan. If you want to be
treated seriously, start figuring out whats really happening.

I see no Kurdistan on my map, Dan. How come, with Saddam penned up
controlling only a third of his country, there still isn't a separate
Kurdish state, Dan? How come the American government has completely
failed to fulfill its promises, Dan? How come suddenly now that war is
close again the Kurds are being brought up again, Dan? How come you
only read propoganda, Dan?


>*I* was the one who "knows about what's going on"
>well enough to point out your mistake.

You have accomplished the exact opposite, Dan. You have attempted to
spin intentions into results, Dan. Good intentions and a dime will buy
you a minute of long distance time.

Do keep posting the truth, Dan. You wave your ignorance around like a
flag.

:-D
