*ahem*
Druid armors that don't look like plain ol' leather:

Tizmak and Ulthork leather: velious texture
Netted kelp: velious texture (this is caster armor with no good druid
stats, but we can put it on)
Nathsar leather: kelp pattern, dark blue/purple
Harmony armor (plane of hate, 2nd floor): kelp pattern, green
Cobalt drake (tailored) armor: tizmak pattern, dark blue
Kromrif military leggings: tizmak pattern
Thurgadin quest armor: tizmak pattern
Kael quest armor: tizmak pattern, dark green
Skyshrine quest armor: tizmak pattern: darker green
(All of the above will look like plain leather if you don't have
Velious or if you have Luclin models on, but they will have colors)
Earth blessed armor (Luclin quest): pale brown leather
Moss toe armor (Rivervale halfling quest armor): light green leather
Soft wicker armor: light green leather
Blue wicker armor): blue leather
Coterie armor: dark reddish brown leather
Gnome skin armor: black leather 

Elven chainmail (wood elf only): turquoise chain
Elysian armor: untinted chain
Vermiculated armor: light green chain
Elder spiritist's armor: dark green chain
Gladiator chain sleeves/leggings: untinted
Bone sleeves/leggings: untinted chain
Fungi tunic: grey chain
Coldain military wristguards: untinted chain, rygorr velious graphic
Dwarven workboots: untinted chain
Chipped bone bracer: untinted chain

Black chitin leggings: black plate
Brown chitin protector (bp): goldenbrown plate
Brown chitin armor: goldenbrown plate
Crystal chitin armor: silver plate with velious plate texture
Golden Efreeti armor: golden plate (boots are common)
Runed mithril bracer: light purple plate
Square helm: plate

For human druids: 
Robe of living fungus: brown and green robe
Crystal covered shroud: lavender robe

Level needed to get these armor varies strongly: some are no drop,
some are quested, some can be bought at prices ranging from a pittance
to thousands of kpp. If you're low level and poor, your best bet on
flashy armor would be to go to the Warrens and Stonebrunt, where the
wicker armors drop.

I wore mostly plain leather look gear till I was level 53 :)
