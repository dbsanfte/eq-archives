I understand.

If you are not worried about getting max exp you can solo there with
charm.

I soloed at the entrance as a 62 druid.  Like I said before no one
goes there on my server and once you break up the spawns it is rather
easy.  Snare, root, dot, debuff, and send in beefed up pet, heal. You
will need the level 61 root that only last a minute.   Anything that
has greater on the name gets left for another group.
