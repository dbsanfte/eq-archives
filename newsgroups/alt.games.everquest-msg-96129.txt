I have a 26 Mage, and I don't worry about the level of pet I summon.  With
nearly any pet, if I play it right I can still take down nearly any yellow
mob.   Usually if I can't take the mob, it isn't because my pet isn't high
enough it is because I got a couple of extra resists, or I clicked on the
wrong spell.
