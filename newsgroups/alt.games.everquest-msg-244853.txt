A much better paladin weapon for you would be the:

Two Tined Corpse Pitchfork
2HS Dly=22, Dmg=26

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17819

Yes, that damage to delay ratio of 26:22 is far superior to the weapons you
have listed below.  You will need to train piercing skills, but it goes up
fast.
