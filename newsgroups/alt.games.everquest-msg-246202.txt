Patch message for May 5:

  "Melees now have the ability to solo."

  Well, no, they didn't say that in so many words; but that's what it
amounted to.

  I keep thinking this is a dream, a joke. It's too good to be true. THIS is
what the melees needed when they gave us those other combat abilities
instead. The difference between bandaging to 50% and bandaging to 70% is
life-changing for warriors, and I suspect rogues too: they can now solo
where they couldn't before, and soloing where they could before is not as
cumbersome. I stopped playing Grugg at 40 because it took 25% of his health,
with temp. to kill succulents solo in OT. Now he can kill two before
bandaging. And Tosev, who was doing fantastic in DSP with 50% bandaging and
Mend to 75%, can now go up to 95%, which is rather like haveing cleric
support.

  Like it or hate it, the simple fact is, lower levels have for some time
been nothing but speed bumps on the road to 65. Grats to SOE for finally
recognizing this.

  As to surname changes: another relief. Changing surnames before seemed too
cumbersome; was it really necessary to have a GM's permission? Now I can try
different names for my characters. Nun is the only one I'm dissatisfied
with, really; Ada was made to be Starwind, Neuv was made to be Sinstorm,
Tosev to be Starfist.
Greban on Drinal, now, I don't know what to name him, so it could be fun
trying different names. His name is an anagram of "banger", but I'm not that
hot on percussion intsruments myself. He'll likely be Headbanger for a week;
Tailbanger will probably be rejected...
