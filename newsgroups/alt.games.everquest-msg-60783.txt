Ah, Nips, I'm sorry but I have to call you on this one. I'm going to ask
you to mentally take yourself out of your current position and try to
think back to where you were when I started my warrior. As I recall, you
sent me a note about how you were going to "tickle Naggy's belly" that
night. What were you wearing then? Would a stack of "1-5Kpp items" have
seemed "insignificant" to you then?

I only just this week joined a new guild, at level 51. They are nowhere
near people like you and Demogorth in this group, but they do have over
thirty people in the 45 to 55 range with a handful higher than that, and
are doing Kael raids, and trying to set up Siren's Grotto attempts, etc.
(Yes, I remember when you were talking about how happy you were in SG
the first time.)

You know what I'm wearing now? Mostly crafted. All my primary weapons
are less than Lammy in status. I'm sitting on a whopping 7Kpp in the
bank which wouldn't even buy one fucking Lammy, say nothing of top end
resist gear, armor, etc. If my new guild (or any, for that matter)
announced that any upgrade I got would require my passing a possibly
valuable existing piece I had on to the guild, I wouldn't have joined.
For those of us with untwinked mains still struggling along in the low
fifties, that kind of sale could make the difference in getting some
better blue diamond resist gear, better stat/taunt weapon, etc. 

I'm sure folks like you and Demogorth (I'm probably butchering that
spelling, sorry) probably pass on stuff on a weekly basis to guildie
twink alts that would make the rest of us drool, but you shouldn't
wonder why it's a "hot topic" for the 97% of the rest of us who couldn't
look at a stack of "1-5Kpp items" without shitting ourselves over
somebody who was so uber that they couldn't even be bothered to sell
them.

Not a dig..... just a reality/perspective check. And this is one area
where I *know* that of which I speak. I'm still in the bush leagues
looking up, and it's a "hot topic" for me to be sure if I ever want to
make it to the next level.
