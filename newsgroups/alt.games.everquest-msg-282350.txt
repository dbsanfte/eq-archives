So,its a gaming operation system!?   :)

Seriously,I wont buy it,I dont like to be forced to registrate
something by phone or via internet I legally bought.
I am really looking forward for its successor with integrated
DRM crap,eating hardware power to protect software or media
I completly leaglly bought.
Better the PC gaming industry supports Linux better,or they
will completly lost me as a customer in the not too far future,
and I cant imagine I am the only one who thinks like this.
