I would do:
1: Put your billing info onto the 2 accounts
2: get another account
3: transfer both to number 2.

Why pay for 3 moves (ENC -> PAL, CLR -> PAL, ENC&CLR->new account) when you 
can just pay for 2.
(Since you can move up to 2 characters for the same price if from same 
location to same new location, at least it used to be this way)

Also the nice thing here is if they do something bad like want to ban 
accounts your PAL account is never mentioned.

Lastly just a bitch - I wish you could transfer to/from FV :(  (I want my 
rogue there to group with my BST)
