Well I pulled a n00b the other day as well.  I was headed to FV after a good
haul in the dreadlands and while en route to the town I saw a necro iskar
down by the waterfall.  I hailed her and was greated with a "Vekis hits you
for 90dmg" followed by the pet whacking me for 30 or so.. I was debating
fighting her until she doubled me for 200 and I thought it was time to make
a quick run to town as my mana was also only at 50%.

I've made that trip probably 50x and never once ran into that gal, sure woke
me up.
