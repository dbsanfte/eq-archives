How about discover whole new continents?  Really, it's no different from 
EQ2 in that regard.  A new area suddenly pops up, regardless of what 
storyline is put forward to explain it.  EQ1 also had increasing maximum 
levels over time, so you could explain away in exactly the same manner as 
you just did for EQ2.

No question at all, it has changed hugely since it's initial release.  
Some say for the better, some say for the worse, most probably think a 
mixture of the two.  Overall, I'd say for the worse, but some of the 
changes were definitely for the better.
