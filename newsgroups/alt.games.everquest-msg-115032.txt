Orcs is the very best way to raise NFP knights, sorry. Buck up though,
my dark elf cleric of inny found that all of a sudden after a bit of
orc bashing I was non kos with them. If you are threaten, you can't be
THAT far from non kos (dubious) She found the same thing with commond
residents, bash orc bash orc bash orc oh apprehensive now whee
surprise! 

If you have bothered to raise freeport merchants via jenam and rebby,
commons residents are most of the other vendors at inns in EC and WC
who are still dubious to you.

As long as you are killing orcs, you can merrily turn in belts to the
militia and STILL be raising Knights of truth. The faction you get
from killing is greater usually than the faction you LOSE from doing a
quest.

Both a little, more because your god is Innoruk though. My dark elf
cleric of inny had the same prob.

Alternate rather fast way to do it:

Have a druid buddy wolf form you in EC. Chase around that altunic
jardin guy buying regular cloth shirts from that inn between the orc
camps, then giving them to him 4 at a time. The person you buy them
from is on commons residents, so the wolf form helps with him as well
as giving you the faction for altunic. I can't remember if my dark elf
cleric could give them to him once amiable in wolf or halfling
form(one use mask from innitiate of innoruk clr shm quest) or indiff.

The quest lowers militia but if you have been turning in orc belts to
the militia from time to time it should not be that bad.

My dark elf cleric of inny did the shirt turn in to get to indiff with
north freeport CLERICS, which is QUITE a feat ;) She was allied to the
paladins for a VERY LONG TIME before the shirts got her to indiff with
the clerics. The clerics can't be raised through kills =/ Due to
turning in SO many shirts to the clerics, and the fact she had killed
ONE militia guy (she got her paladin guild testimony of truth, for no
apparent reason other than to get one as a dark elf cleric of inny
seemed fun), got her to threaten with the militia. Doing some high
hold quests then getting a wolf form from a druid and turning in some
orc belts to the militia fixed that.

If you have never killed a militia guard, you won't go kos anytime
soon doing quests that raise knights. In fact, I don't even think it
is possible to go kos from quests alone unless you STARTED out kos
or made at least one murder. If it is, it takes one hell of a long
time because my wood elf druid was apprehensive or dubious to militia
then turned in a billion rat ears to Rephas in qeynos hills. 

Back then, when she was level 9, every 20th rat ear or so got a malosi
spell which sold to an npc for 3 plat. That doesn't sound like a lot
until you know you can buy unlimited rat ears in WC, make a newbie
train to rephas on a new server for protection, then turn in your
8x20x8 stacks of rat ears. When she got tired of doing this, mostly
because they nerfed it due to how often people were doing it right
then (probably sent off hidden economy alarms, how do these level 9
people on a new server have 900 plat?), she went back to freeport and
was still only dubious to militia. ONE militia murder hit later and
she was instantly threaten.
