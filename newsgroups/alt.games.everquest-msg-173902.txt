We'll be heading there soon, but we go further in.  Our next foray into The 
Hole will be to see how far we can go before we wipe.

I went to Velks last night and got in an US group.  I had never been -
anywhere- in Velks except on the bottom, so this was an experience for me.  
On our server, US is up the ramps quite a bit, and apparently the named 
that drops the SCHW is part of that camp.  At first, it was Me, an Epic 
Druid ( was there for the threads ), a Necro, and a bard.  The Druid was 
pulling AND tanking for about 30 minutes, and sadly, he did it well as we 
had no downtime at all.  A monk joined, yet, the druid still pulled, as he 
was high enough level to single.  Then, an SK joined and we rolled along 
quickly for about 45 minutes.

Then the "Servers down in 10 minutes" message came up, so we killed a few 
more and logged.  I was pretty happy with the EXP I got and I got some more 
silks for tailoring.  I let the Druid have all the threads, as I know I'll 
be back there for more later.
