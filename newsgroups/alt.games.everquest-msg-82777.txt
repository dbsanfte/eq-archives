The difference here, my low leveled friend, is that someone talking over the
movie can obviously be a distraction that is not easily avoided without
moving a distance away. In order for someone to offend you with thier
"fantasy" name, you would actually have to make the effort to read it in the
first place. If this becomes an "issue" to you, don't read the name.

No, I'm not talking about names with profanity or racial slurs which are
purely distasteful, but "clever" names like a friend of mine who uses a
surname of "kicksyaindachips", or in common language, "Kicks you in the
balls". Who could possibly be offended to the point where they feel
compelled to complain to a GM about this name? I had to change my Halfling
Rogue's name from "Stinkyfinger" to "Nimblethorne" because some puritan jerk
was offended by what HE/SHE thought it implied.

How is it that we have become so intolerant of each other in a "fantasy
world"?

I say again... It's about having fun, not a way of life, losers!
