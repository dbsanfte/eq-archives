Oh puhleaze.  Like the USA *could* have more enemies.  That's not possible.
We've got the entire world telling us to sign onto the Kyoto treaty (which
would shut down our industries) and telling us to sign onto the World Court
(which would railroad rich Americans into that court so that they could be
'fined').  Our enemies are the people who want to tell us how to run our
nation, and that is EVERYBODY.  It's ridiculous on the face of it, it's
like somebody trying to tell Wayne Gretzky how to play hockey or Tiger Woods
how to golf.  Champions don't need advice from losers, and the naysayers
are just full of crap.  France pissed me off this week.  Sore losers.

Lance Armstrong won the Tour de France for the fourth consecutive time.
Rather than admitting that the cancer survivor is one hell of a great
athlete, the French are accusing him of using drugs to win.  Why?  Because
he's an American and they don't think Americans should win.

The exact same thing happened just a few weeks ago, when the USA Soccer
Team was in the World Cup championship.  Not one country wanted the USA
team to win.  Not one.  The USA has no friends in this world, unless they
want our money.  Otherwise, every nation on Earth is cheering for the fall
of the USA.  Losers hate success, and the world hates the USA.
