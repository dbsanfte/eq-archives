I haven't been in a long long time (since my first week of luclin, infact)

Firstly, green mobs rampaging = not funny

I was in the most desperate pickup group back then too.. oh man!  We pulled
1 mob, had 1 add (no problem, we have a cleric *and* chanter) and they are
both just blue.  Well the chanter dies, followed by the cleric.  Great.

We kill the mobs, and in the meantime I go scouting the zone, the cleric is
running back, through dawnshroud (he was lvl 57 or so) and he dies,  wtf to,
i have no clue.

So he rants.. runs back to DS and rezzes himself.  He immediatly dies again
within seconds lol.

Were all sitting at the zone-line, then all of a sudden the wizards familiar
dies (for no apparant reason) and this insta-killed the wizard.

Around this point Im howling with laughter, and luckily went LD (a genuine
LD, honest!).. sometimes I don't mind that "active character" message
