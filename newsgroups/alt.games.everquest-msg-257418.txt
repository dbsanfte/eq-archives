If any fantasy character is to be the conception of what a ranger should be,
Aragorn from LotR is it.

He is skilled with a bow, sure, but his melee was far better, along with his
tracking and outdoor craft.

I still hate him for the glut of rangers on servers now (at least on VS).

Legolas has more to answer for, he is no ranger, he is an archer, but many
people think of him as a ranger...
