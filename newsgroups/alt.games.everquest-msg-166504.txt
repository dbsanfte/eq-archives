Aye, I try these when I can, tho for some reason they're pretty popular on
my server, and often camped.  Yesterday, this one druid was killing them
ALL, rooting and doting them each in turn; he had 'em rooted all around.
Quite greedy if you ask me, but then if I had been him I wouldn't think so.

And I'd get a group in DL but they tell me that it hurts faction for my
epic.  I truly hope not, because I was out there for a level or so, and I've
not researched my necro epic at all. =\.

Thank you for your input though, and If it werent' so overcamped, it would
be an uber spot.
