Some quests give significant experience.  Sadly, those quests become a grind
all their own, with people doing the same quest over and over for the
experience output.

With the advent of PoP, it should be simplicity itself to deal with this.
Just flag a character when he completes each quest, and give him a good
healthy shot of exp.. its ok, because the exp is one shot, after that, either
make it impossible for him to do the quest again, or in some cases let him
keep doing the quest, but no more exp.
