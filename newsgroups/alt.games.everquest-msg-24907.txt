Thank God it wasn't me...

I was grouped with a 36 ranger guildy last night when we decided to run to
the bank in freeport.  We take seperate routes and meet in the bank where i
see that he is at half health.  I ask and he says that the night before, him
and another were killing guards in west commons.  He found out the hard way
that he was kos in east and west freeport now.  After banking, I had to log
for 15 minutes and let him know, I would be back.
Logged back in and headed to East commons.  At the west freeport gate I came
opon the horror. a line of corpses with my guildies tag on them. DOH!  I ran
out to the zone line in time to see him die again.  I yelled in guildchat
for him to consent me and disconnect (LESSON 1), but he finally made it to
zone without dieing.  Apparently, he was running from the gates to east
commons, had camo on, then started arguing on the phone with his girlfriend
(LESSON 2). Camo popped, guards killed him and his bind point was... West
freeport gates!  4 death cycles before he even reallized he hadn't zoned
into ec.  Then 8 more trying in a panic to run to ec or nfp.  Lost 36 and
all of 35!

After calming him down. I drug all the bodies (have to admit I lined them up
in a sort of death art and took a pic, in a month or 2 i'll even be brave
enough to guildpost it!) over to the southwest ec zone line and we started
looking for high clerics.   We found a level 49 in south karanas who we
could afford and sent a guild druid to fetch her.  I even bribed a chanter
to come from the EC tunnel to keep the cleric breezed while she rezzed all
10 corpses (LESSON 3, dont accidentally loot naked corpses, as the ranger
lost 2 that way! I smacked him hard for that).  We got the ranger 4 yellows
back into 35 so he ended up not so bad off as it could have been.
