You know youngster, when I was your age, we didn't have Newbie Armor... We ran
around in Mud Stained Tunics and pieces of Ruined Gnoll Chain for 10 or 15
levels and were damn glad to have those!

And Newbie Weapons?  Young person, I didn't have my first decent weapon until
my 18th or 19th Season...

hehe  Glad you got your Pelvis bone  :)

=P  G'luck on the rest of the legging bits!
