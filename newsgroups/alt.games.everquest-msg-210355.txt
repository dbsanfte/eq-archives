Heh.  Maybe.  I play a 47 Pally.  I stun a mob when the puller announces
it's incoming, stun it again when it gets to camp, and keep stunning it as
soon as my stun spell gems refresh (I currently have three).  I defy anyone
to take aggro from me.  Every once in a while a slower will get aggro when
they get their slow in before I can stun for the second or third time, but
one more stun from me gets aggro right back.

This is not to say I'm better than an SK; it's my understanding that SK's
are the kings of aggro control.  But a well-played pally ought to be able to
keep aggro locked for as long as they want to.
