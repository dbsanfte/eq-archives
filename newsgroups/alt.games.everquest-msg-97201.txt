The entrance is a bit further north then you'd think by the map.  I'd
get way up on that north wall, and run to where you think it should
be.  You should more or less 'fall' into into the groove that will run
you north to OT.

Regarding that list bit.  Raft from Oasis to ogre island.  Depending
on your level, avoid the ogres, run along the shoreline/ rocks to the
dock.  Get on boat.  When it zones into OT, just jump and swim for
shore.  Don't swim to the docks...
