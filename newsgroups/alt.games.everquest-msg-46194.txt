Go to a merchant, open a buy/sell window, and then click once on
everything you are wearing or weilding, and click on all 8 general
inventory slots.  The merchant will say to you what price they would
give for the item, or say they are not interested.  In both cases, the
merchant will name the item you clicked on.  If the item is a
container, the merchant will automatically act as if you clicked on
all items in the container.

Then go swap your 8 general inventory slots for the 8 things in your
bank slots, and do it again.

You now have in your log a complete inventory of everything you have
on that character and in the bank.

To make it easier to find in the log, you can say something like
"inventory listing start here" before you start clicking, and then
search for that string in your logs.  Or, just note (or /note) the
time, since log entries are timestamped.
