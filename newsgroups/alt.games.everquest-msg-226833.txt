I have only been playing for the last three months so I have not 'been 
through' the pre PoP era of druid porting.  However, during these three 
months I have been asked quite often for ports, usually to Stonebrunt 
from PoK or out of Cobalt Scar/Jaggedpine, but often other places too. 
All these requests have resulted in a donation for helping people out. I 
don't ask for donations as I work on the basis that what goes around 
comes around.  I may need their help one day :)

Indeed.  My druid is L52.  As I have increased in levels the amount of 
money made from forage and loot has increased correspondingly, which has 
meant that I can afford better equipment as I need it.

Sure, at l20 it would have been nice to have 10k to spend, but I doubt 
that having the corresponding equipment would have made me a better 
druid.  Quite the reverse, being relatively untwinked taught me how to 
hunt and use the skills available to me.  Sure, sometimes it takes a 
while to get to the next level, but what's the rush!  It comes 
eventually, even that period from 44 to 49 which takes an age.  I spent 
those days in Jaggedpine slowly accumulating xp.  When I got bored I 
went fishing, hung around PoK and ported a few people about etc.

So months or years ago the game was different for druids.  <Shrug> Can't 
be helped.  There are lots of other characters to play if you don't want 
to play a druid.

As to grouping, I have got here with minimal grouping.  I have spent 
lots of time chatting with people in the same zones and helping each 
other out.  Just because people don't ask for druids, does not mean that 
they are not wanted.  My impression has been that most people assume the 
druid is soloing and don't bother asking them to group.  Try advertising 
your desire to group.  There's a wonderful tool in the Ykesha expansion. 
The one time I tried it I had four requests within a minute - two for 
LDoN (which I don't have) and two for regular groups.

Forget the rush to the top and have fun.  After all, once you get to 65 
and all your AA's what are you going to do??
