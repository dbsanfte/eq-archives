I'm up to level 47, almost 48.  I solo a lot, as I normally only play for 1
to 2 hours at a time.  I find soloing VERY easy for a shaman.  Also my guild
asks me ot come along on almost every raid, unless the mob is over 55 then
I'm not very useful against the mob itself.  I think Shaman are the most
versitile class in the game, second only to a VERY well played Enchanter.  I
have never once been told, oh we don't need a shaman, I normally hear, get
here ASAP.  I have often been pulled into groups with people 8 to 10 levels
above me, just for my buffs.  I'm completly safe as I really don't ever
attack (or heal with that much of a difference).

Oh wait, I mean shaman suck and you don't want to play one, they are very
hard to level and no one ever wants you in a group.  Go play a druid or a
necro...

Tuls 47 Shaman.
