LOL, my note to self:

Zoning from Bazaar to Shadowhaven to pick up some more Paela Tannin to make.
Damn, why cant I move. Hmm must remember to put that 50k in bank BEFORE
zoning into Shadowhaven. SOW cant be cast in Shadowhaven, luckily a kind
soul gave me a strength buff just enough to move to zone back again.

I wonder if anyone else has been caught out like this :)

Cheers
Cebi
