This is total bullshit I have seen GMs reimburse items and
respawn epic mobs. That guide is an ass.

Yes they are trained to say 'NO!' to everything at first. Trust me I know.
This is to stop all the frivolous bullshit that the whiners and kids try to
pull on the guides. Unfortunately this pisses off and frustrates legitimate
players with legitimate problems. Sucks but that is the way it is. Kind
of like when the dog really eats your homework.

The bottom line is to email the lead GM of your server and keep
petitioning until he say no. If he says no then and ONLY then are you
screwed. Guides don't know dick and can't do shit except pull your
corpse out of the wall.

Be patient, be polite, be persistent and get to the Lead GM.
He is the guy with the power.

Personally unless its a huge problem I'd just suck it up and do the
quest over again. Its not worth the hassle to get it fixed most times.
