    I think we'd better get used to it. For the foreseeable future,
according to VI all they have on their plate is bug fixes and content
twiddling. Hopefully this period will last a good, long time. :-)

    Euros and Asians aren't happy, but the Tier Two guilds should be even
unhappier. If something dies on a schedule, and you know when it died last
by /who-stalking the big guild that killed it, you can be set up and ready
to go when it repops and the big guild MIGHT respect your raid. If you have
to have mules in the zone (and big guilds are the best at mule games) and
then organize to get there faster than another guild, well, good luck.

    This solves the problem of overlooting VERY neatly, as once you have an
item on your corpse you can't continue looting. You HAVE to figure out what
to shuffle around in your inventory before continuing.

    Short cleric - big grin. VERY happy about this one. No more /who all
bodyonground followed by a /ttell "Is this ressable? Want it ressed?"

    Has the spire done that to you? The only time I've been in the area but
without a shard, I was moved to the safe point in the zone. Hopefully that's
been done away with. (It happened to mini-D, who could have been owned by
anything she met on her run from the safe point at the time.)

    I sold all my leather paddings as smithing was too brutal to raise - the
next day metal sheets stacked. I was killed in Sebilis because I was stunned
too many times while DA was up to run - next patch DA'ed folks couldn't be
stunned. Play long enough and a patch will nail you. Imagine, if you can,
the monks who paid up to 100 K pp for those Elder Holgresh Beads that have
right-click Eye of Zomm - the beads are now almost completely worthless to
them. Still, /hug Tiru.

    Sounds like something from the snake temple in Luclin, the home of the
Shissar. My gut tells me it'll turn out to be the name of the Emperor of the
Shissar, whom I don't think has been killed/reached yet - he may be now
reachable. I HOPE the connection to the slaves and Glox, beyond backstory,
is that the Shackle quests for monks have been extended - then my getting
half the Shackle of Steel last night won't have been an exercise in boredom,
but might lead to something really neat.
