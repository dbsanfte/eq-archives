I have to say something about this

It's going to sound like I'm picking on you, Sui, but I've heard SO
many people use a phrase along the lines of...

"I've invested a lot of time in this game..."

Let's clarify something here. An investment is something in which you
place something - money, time, apple pies, whatever - and in return
you receive something in exchange.

EQ isn't a savings account. It isn't a bond you place money into and
get a percentage return - this is a game. The return on your
investment is the fun/relaxation/frustration you receive while playing
the game - nothing more, nothing less.

When you're finally done playing for the day (or forever), Varent
isn't going to send you a check for all the time you've invested. If
for some reason Verant/SOE went belly-up tomorrow, they would owe you
nothing. Correction, they might owe you a credt for the balance of the
month you didn't get to play. Here's your $5.00.

/e goes back to his cubicle and is applauded by the masses for
shutting up.
