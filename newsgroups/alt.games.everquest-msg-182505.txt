You're the only one I can recall off-hand discussing the ring wars at 
any length, so you get to answer my question, since I'm getting a lot of 
"dunno"s and such when asking in-game - is there a required starting 
faction for the coldain ring quests?  I mean, do I have to be amiable or 
ally or such before I can start even the first ring quest, or is the 
default apprehensive good?  And if apprehensive is good to start, does 
the faction requirement change as you go up in rings?
