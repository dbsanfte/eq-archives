Ben, you haven't yet offered a solution.  You've said "cut off the snake's
head", "prevent the need", "deal with the political reasons", etc., etc.,
but you have not yet told us what you think the "snake's head" or "political
reasons" are, or how you think we ought to "cut them off".  Instead of
spouting blurry catchphrases, why don't you actually speak English and tell
us what you're trying to propose?

Yeah, Ben, it's called "appeasement".  What you're saying is, ok, now, you
crushed Al Qaeda, good for you.  Now go do what they wanted you to do when
they blew up the WTC.  Well, for one thing we dont' believe what we've been
doing is wrong.  For another, you yourself said they want the martyrdom
part.  So what you're saying is we should give them martyrs by destroying Al
Qaeda, then pull out like they wanted in the first place so they can tell
all their new young recruits, look, these guys were martyred for a great
cause -- they died but by dying they drove the Great Satan out!  If we crush
them and do *nothing" they want then they have martyrs who died and
accomplished absolutely nothing.  Even if I agreed with you that we
shouldn't be in the Middle East, I would have to say that doing what Al
Qaeda wanted us to do would be complete suicide.  We would be practically on
our knees begging them to come back and blow us up whenever we look at them
crosseyed.

Incidentally I find this rather amusing.  After 9/11 when we decided to go
to war with Afghanistan, Europe was screaming these exact same arguments,
calling us the Great Satan for attacking Afghanistan.  Afterwards, when
every single reason that had been presented by Europeans against attacking
Afghanistan turned out to be false, Europe shut up for a bit, then when we
decide to attack SH they start screaming again: "Yeah, well, we guess it was
ok after all to attack Afghanistan, but you can't attack Iraq because
<insert here all the same reasons we were so evil for attacking
Afghanistan>!"
