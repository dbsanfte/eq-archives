Same, I've never even noticed the 54 wolf form to leave behind people
I cast my 54 sow on. Its just not enough faster to use it only for the
speed when you have to cast it again if you zone. I only use 54 wolf
form for the MANA regain, at 55 with a LOT of mana its DEFINATELY
worth that. I notice QUITE a large difference which is why I can't
wait to add 3 alt advance points to mana gain and then use 54 wolf and
really get a boost.

Yeah, really NO speed increasing spells are that great except to
escape nasties who might jump you except for selos.  I heard of a guy
once timing a trip from the NK stone bridge across wk to qeynos with
no sow, with wolf form, with sow and casting cheetah when he could
cast it, and with just plain sow. His findings? from the fastest
example to no speed ehancement at all was a difference of like 3
minutes. All of those make you FEEL like you are moving a lot faster
but generally you are talking about minutes even at the best point.
