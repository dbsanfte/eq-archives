This meshes with my experiences so far, with one exception,
in the first group below the 58 got fewer points than the 65's

To add to it from my experience -
5x65 + 1x58 (avg 63.8) gets 51pts
Mobs were half DB to 58 half even/yellow/red
Mobs hit for 380ish, and had 15k+hp

4x65 + 2x58 (avg 62.7) gets 34pts
Mobs were all DB to 58
Mobs hit for 260ish, and had 10kish hp

Also, was in a failed adventure with my 52 enchanter
yester day.  52, 53, 57, 57, 58, 59 (avg 56) Mobs
hit for 170ish

Interesting note - 
380 x 2/3 = 253 (close to the 60 mob hit)
260 x 2/3 = 173 (close to the 55 mob hit)

So, if we round those down (very common in EQ formulas - although
no longer universal by your info up above) we get avg63 gets the
65 adventure, avg 62 gets the 60.

If they are 5 level ranges, this implies - (note - 65, 60 are 
confirmed by personal experience, 55 has only one piece of 
empirical data, mob hit, the rest are based on conjecture)

avg level 63+ on hard gets level 70
avg level 63+ gets level 65   51pts -- mobs 58-62, 15khp, 370hitter
avg level 58-62 gets level 60 34pts -- mobs <58,   10khp, 260hitter
avg level 53-57 gets level 55 22pts -- mobs xx-xx,  
avg level 48-52 gets level 50 16pts -- mobs xx-xx,  
avg level 43-47 gets level 45 11pts -- mobs xx-xx,  
avg level 38-42 gets level 40  8pts -- mobs xx-xx,  
avg level 33-37 gets level 35  6pts -- mobs xx-xx,
avg level 28-32 gets level 30  4pts -- mobs xx-xx, 
avg level 23-27 gets level 25  3pts -- mobs xx-xx, 
avg level 20-22 gets level 20  2pts -- mobs xx-xx,   

We need more data - if anyone can please add
group avg level (round down), mob max hit, mob hp
and reward pts for each person and their level
 - then we can determine if we have the 
table right.
