Mezz takes awhile to cast, i have grouped with some jumpy warriors who
have made things very difficult for me by wacking a mob i was trying to
mezz that was on me. If I have one mob on me I am not worried about
being able to mezz it, it will happen eventually. Mezz is a major taunt
though,  can't tell you how many times I have died because this is not
understood.

Two or more on me feel free to jump in, I am probably dead anyway, and
something has gone wrong...

Yes, my wife played a cleric and we played together often, anthing that was
on her would be asleep. To say this is how it works would be an
understatement.

Trust me, if something goes remotly wrong, the enchanter dies first. You
know how many times I have died and the fight is done and everyone is
standing with close to full health?

The level 34 Mezz last 72 seconds, are you, as the warrior keeping track
of which mobs were mezzed when? I hope not, but I do. If I say "do the
whipcracker next" it is because the dirtcaller is fast asleep and I am not
sure when the whipcracker will awake. If the dirtcaller wakes up it will
be back asleep very soon, and I hope it casts on me.  I don't feel the
same about whipcrackers.

I was in a party over the weekend with a warrior who was doing multiple
pulls and announcing what he was pulling and what to attack, on one
occasion he pulled a Brea, a Brute, and a Whipcracker. The warrior
called them out as he was pulling them back and he then informed
everyone to attack the brute, I overroad him and told everyone to attack
the Brea. I did not have time to explain that mezz does not work on
giants, nor did I expect a warrior to have this knowledge. Everyone
listened and we were fine.

I know the only reason he was pulling multiple mobs like he was was 
because I was there and he was counting on my abilities to keep
everyone safe. There are places one can go where you will need an
enchanter and you will need to listen to them.

Also if you walk up and start wacking on a mezzed mob, it will make 
a beeline for me. If you walk up to it and taunt it three or four times
before whacking it, it will forget me, (for a bit), and attack you.
