Sounds like AoE bard songs to me... .;)

Sentinel just happens to be one of those spells with very limited
application.   The thing that does make it useful is the thing
that people don't seem to know about it:  you can cast it in an
area and then leave the area and still get the messages.

One could, for instance, camp Ragefire from the relative safety
of near the OT or BW zone lines and get instant notification
when Ragefire spawns without being subjected to the "accidental"
trains that seem to happen to solo clerics sitting on the ledge
overlooking his spawn point.   Or, at a lower-level, "camp" one of
Quillmane's spawn points while getting XP at the spires.

It has its uses...
