	Trueshot does not compare to backstab, at least not until you have maxed
Archery Mastery, Endless Quiver and the right acrylia-series arrow (or better)
slotted.

	And I have never known a Shaman who would allow Earthcall to stand.  It's
like a point of honor with them, the mob gets slowed by them or not at all.
I've seen them bleed their mana bars trying to overwrite my Earthcalls.  (And
yes, I announce when it lands -- not so important on raids but very important
in regular play, since I just made a mob unmessable.)  I doubt that the extra
20% slow is worth half a Shaman's mana, but there you have it.

|    You've known for the longest time you aren't a plate tank, so trying to

	Not so much a complaint as a pop culture reference (from _Not Another Teen
Move_...or its trailer anyway, which I understand is as much of it as is worth
seeing.)
