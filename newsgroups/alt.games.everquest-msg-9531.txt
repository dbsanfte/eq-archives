But John! I thought you'd approve! I'm emulating your bestest lying
trolling buddy; Bizbee. Giving him a taste of his own medicine; you
know? Usenet stalking. I trust you'll pass on your advice about
professional help to him?

But no. You won't, will you? Because that isn't the reason you have me
KFed, is it? Stop lying to yourself, then to this newsgroup. Unless,
of course, you have Bizbee KFed too? No?

>And stop changing your name to get past kill filters you moron.

Awww ain't that just sweet! Emulating your buddy; the man who needs a
thesaurus even more than he needs to get laid. Try picking a few words
other than moron now and again. You know? Interchange them with
others... or do you have to get permission from Ronnie first?

>Back in you go.

And out I come.

And in I go.

You can run but you can't hide. Until you exhibit some honesty as to
why you KF people at a whim, you'll keep seeing me.

Well... be seeing ya.
