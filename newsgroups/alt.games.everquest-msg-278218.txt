Idle speculation: all the major new games (WoW and EQ2) have launched, and
been out long enough that everyone that is going to leave EQ1 for them has
done so, and nothing major is coming up soon.  That leaves EQ1 with a fairly
resiliant population that won't be hurt much, if it all, by a price
increase.  So, it gets them free money, and makes the all access pass more
attractive, which might encourage people to buy other SOE games, which gets
Sony an upfront sum there, plus makes it even less likely those people will
leave SOE in the future.
