It is a Fear, and it's dangerous to practice in a dungeon if it hits!  If
it's like the monk Instill Doubt skill, all other special attack buttons
have to be ungreyed in order for it to land.  For rogues I suppose that
means backstab.

Even at 200 skill it is tough to land because it has to pass about 5 checks
(for monks anyway):

1) No recent special attacks.
2) It has to pass the Instill Doubt skill check.
3) The Instill Doubt kick has to land.
4) Then it has to pass a resist check.
5) Finally, it might just last a short time, since it is checked every tick
for wearing off.

My 53 monk is successful about 1 in 3 or 4 times I would guess at 200 skill
against low blue mobs.

The best way to practice is while traveling somewhere or while waiting for a
raid or group etc.  Select any distant target and just keep hitting the
button when it pops.  You can do it while running.  Just make sure you're
not in range if it's something that might beat you to a pulp. ;^)
