Who gives  a darn if soulscream belts are flooding the bazaar?  30K is too
much for them anyway.  They are a common drop that are easily attainable.
He seemed to imply that he was a newbie when he made a point of saying how
they were flooding the market and that makes it some sort of big deal.  He
also implied that EQ is dead and just waiting on the final nails to be put
into its coffin.  If he feels that way then please, don't let the door hit
his ass on the way out.
