Old GlowPlug there was part of a group from Air Warriors that went
around attacking other ng's looking for prime dorks like you. By the
time I was done with them the game maker made a public statement voicing
the embarrassment they felt from being associated with this group and
even shut down some newsgroups. No less than three people were fired
from their real jobs as they attempted to track down one of their own in
real life. Today as a result of it's own community Air Warriors is a
dying game losing subscriptions everyday. Some of them are in process of
downloading this ng as we speak. Don't count on me to save you as they
claim to be attacking me they will be trying to destroy this community.
