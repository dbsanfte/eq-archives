        From sdcarl!rusty  Mon May 11 09:00:58 1981
        To: ucbvax^mark
        Subject: newsgroup fa, net, etc.

        Won't we need to change the .ngfile also? Also is ALL an
acceptable newsgroup
        on the left side of the dot such that ALL.ALL will catch
everything?


Rusty is right (or is that "Rusty is Wright"?) - we have ALL in our
.ngfile
so I tend to forget this.  ALL.ALL may or may not work, but ALL
certainly does.


        Mark


I plan to make the change on Tuesday unless something horrible happens.

Apparently nothing too horrible happened after they changed the .ngfile

because we're still pecking out our little newsgroup messages all over
the world 24 years later.

Mark,
Yes, the .ngfile needs to be fixed and maybe we should use .net instead

of .ALL, talk to the guys and let me know what you think.
By the way, my friggin 8-track just went out in my pinto so i think i'm

going to pick me up one of those new Casset Tape decks. Those things
are outta sight, I hear Rick James has one! He's my hero, anyway get
back to me soon on that other stuff.

Brian

Yeah, but it's not the oldest one on the net. Look at this site:

http://communication.ucsd.edu/bjones/Usenet.Hist/Nethist/0061.html
The earliest post at that site is from May 27, 1980


Lots of other ancient stuff on there too...
