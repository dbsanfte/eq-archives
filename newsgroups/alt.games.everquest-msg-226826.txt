Well I can't speak for general exp grouping these days since I play 90%
LDoN, but I can say that LDoN has _increased_ druids' desireability for
groups. I would say that around 2/3 of all LDoN groups I am in include a
druid, and that was true even before I passed 58 when druids get their
semi-complete heal. LDoN makes versatile classes relatively more valued, and
druids definitely qualify: often part of the healing solution when no cleric
can be found, a nuker/dotter when more DPS is needed, tracking is important
for LDoN purposes, useful buffing of various types....when I'm starting a
LDoN group (which is often), I love to grab a druid as among my first
recruits.
