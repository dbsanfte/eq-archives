For a better weapon at virtually no cost, get yourself a rusty short
sword and combine it in a forge with a sharpening stone to get a
tarnished short sword. Might as well do that with your rusty 2 hander,
as well (it reduces the delay by 1). Carry a shield in your other
slot. Trade off between the 2 hander and the short sword to keep 1hs
and 2hs maxed.

For that 20pp, you could prolly pickup a Langseax (1hs). I got mine
about that level. The guy was asking 25pp. I offered a HQ Bear pelt
and he took. The Langseax is the result of a quest in Halas, so there
should be some around your area.

When you can afford it, go for the Langseax of the Wolves (2hs).
Another quest in Halas, but I bought mine for 2 HQ Bear Pelts and 50pp
at around 15th level - used it till about 30th.
