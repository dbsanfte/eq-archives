You may want to check on the stacking again.

Spirit Quickening:
Slot 2 STR+30
Slot 3 AC 19-21
Slot 4 20% Haste

Harness/Focus
Slot 1 +Max HP
Slot 2 +Current HP
Slot 4 +STR
Slot 5 +Dex
Slots 6-8 Overwrite/blocking of STR/DEX in Slot 1 spells.

Haste Spells
Slot 1 Haste

So, barring additional special code to deal directly with it, it should 
stack with both haste spells, and the harness/focus line of spells very 
nicely.  All this according to lucy.fnord.net
