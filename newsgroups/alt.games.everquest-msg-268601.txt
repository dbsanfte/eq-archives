I can't speak for higher levels, but I've played about 90% of EQ2 so
far solo (currently lvl 18). When I did want a group, I never really
had too much trouble finding one, and now that I joined a guild it's
even easier.

However, I prefer soloing most of the time simply because I get to
keep all the uber drops for myself. Plus, it's kinda annoying how
every time I do win a lotto, someone always says "hey I need that
item".

Yes they are. If you don't like work, just ignore them like I am :)
