K didn't bother looking up the GJBS stats, at 11/25 its definitely lower
ratio than a Lammy though it would definitely reduce the agro if he switched
them out at the expence of damage. A better solution of course would be to
get a Wurmmy or a Centi LS or some other slow high ratio weapon for a
primary since prior to the 50s ratio is far more important than delay.
