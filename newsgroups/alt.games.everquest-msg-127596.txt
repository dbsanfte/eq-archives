Does anyone have one of these unused keys spare? For some reason, I didnt
get the email with it in, and I have been trying to find another copy of the
uk gold edition for a while, but everywhere is sold out... I contacted EQ
customer services, but its been a week with no reply (other than the 'we
have recieved your email' email). I currently have 8 active chars on my
account, and I desperately need another account to be my mule hehe - bank
space is at a premium as it is.

If anyone does, it would be greatly appreciated - even if it is just the
basic EQ version!
