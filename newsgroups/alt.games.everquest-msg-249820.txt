In ML its this way for a very long time,I gave up leveling my Druid 
there in 2002 cause it was impossible to work with track there,
I thought it was a nice idea to go there at 50 and make xp and lots of
plat at the same time with superb and flawless hides,but no.
From time to time I checked the zone again until today,always
was the vast  majority of hoppers under surface.
Same with Rock spiderlings in BB,I go there since 2 years,always
were most of them under the mountains.

So I have to disagree,its not a DX9 problem and it has not become
worse recently.
