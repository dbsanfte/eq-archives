Group,

I got this driver from a thread above, but thought it would be nice to
alert others in a more specific message.  This is the driver that
works for me - I just confirmed it.

Win2k:

http://mirror.ati.com/support/drivers/win2k/W2KRADEON51316037.html

This is the only fix that seems to be posted and working.

I did add the following lines to the eqclient.ini file:
HardwareTnL=FALSE
VertexShaders=FALSE

I hope this fixes it for you.  Talk about an instance of "if it ain't
broke don't fix it!".

Julie
