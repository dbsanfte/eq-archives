Hi, I gave up on AOL ages ago. They still bar loads of web sites- and I dont
mean Adult content either ;)
I use BT internet -works great, gives 24 hour access, costs �14.99 per
month.
However it does disconnect in the daytime charge band every hour and a half.
Expect cutoffs on a Friday night aswell.
There isnt any warning, just the link goes dead!

A better option, I also use.. is Demon Internet.
Premier connect I think its called, basically I pay �10 per month to Demon,
and pay BT �5 per month to use the surftime package.. appears on your BT
phone bill.
This combined @ �15.00 gives me a solid connection that doesnt disconect in
the hours it works.
I use the Demon option, from 6 PM to 8 AM Mon to Friday, and all day and
night on Saturday and Sunday.
Demon is great, you can have many e-mail addresses, basically anything you
like @hostname.demon.co.uk.
The news feed on Demon is great, though be-warned.. they carry ALL of the
groups, including the Adult oriented ones.

When I have better finances I will upgrade my Demon Account, to the plus
option.
This will cost me @ �20 per month th Demon, and �20.00 to BT Surftime.
At �40.00 per month, it will give me 24 hour access, no cut offs no
problems!
Demon also give 24 hour tech support, sosting only a local call, decent free
web space and loads of stuff onsite.
though I will admit Demon's Website is a little corporate looking-- not
really Jazzy and funky :-)
Good Luck, and hope this helps .
