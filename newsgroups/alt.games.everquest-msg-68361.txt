Hi,

Thanks for all of your input concerning this.  To answer some of the
questions that were asked:

The loud humming sound is present whether or not there is a CD in the
drive.  It is the same both ways.  Inserting or removing a CD has no
effect.  (We can hear the sound of the CD Rom drive whiring, but there
is no difference in the humming noise itself)

And my Mother does not even turn on her computer speakers, she hardly
uses them.  So most of the time her speakers are not even turned on.

The humming/buzzing noise is so loud that we can hear it when standing
in another room.  Or when I call her on the phone.  She does not have
to put the phone up to the computer in order for it to be heard.

As I said before the humming sound seems to be in addition to what would
be normal computer background noise.

It is rather loud.

Thanks for your advice...

 - Mike Dorr
