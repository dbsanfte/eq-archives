Thanks for the explanation.

The post I had refered to made it sound like a HoT spell, hence the 
confusion.

I do have a baby necro, but as you can see, I have much to learn. There is 
so much to learn on each of the 16 (?) different classes, I find it hard to 
believe anyone can be an expert on them all. That is why I came to ask 
questions... to get answers.

Thanks to you who have been enlightening me!!
