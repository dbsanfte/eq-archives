But that's precisely the point, isn't it?  If count *did* include
anons, what you would expect is that /w all druid 45 would yield 2
players and /w all druid 45 count would give you 37 or something.
Further, the fact that 3 were listed when I took anon off (me and the
exact same two names from the first time) is to my mind a very strong
indicator no one was logging off or on and that count simply doesn't
do what you were hoping it does.  In my opinion (only) the likeliest
explanation is that there probably *were* many more than 3 level 45
druids logged on, but the rest were anon.

We're getting into a long argument about something that really isn't
that important :), but....try it yourself.  Go anon and then type /
all <yourclass> <yourlevel> and then again with count.  Once you've
got it typed in, you can go back and forth with shift-up-arrow.  Do
that several times, and if the counts keep agreeing, then you're
approaching statistical certainty.

Or don't, and have fun instead :)
