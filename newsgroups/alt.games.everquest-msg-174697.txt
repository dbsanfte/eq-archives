We did the cycle again last night.  A really funny thing happened...
although there were deaths during the battle with Avhi, no skeletons
spawned... until Avhi died.  Then suddenly a *whole bunch* of skeletons
spawned, and I, cleverly prepared, cast ITU and watched the skeletons
destroy everyone who wasn't FD'd.

After the recovery, our guild leaders made sure to spam that no one is to
hail the PP.  In fact, they ordered us to move back to the Bishop's spawn
point after the HP went down.  They also had everyone who wasn't flagged
/join nokey.  It turned out there were less than 36 people who needed the
flag still, so everyone who came ended up flagged.

Yeesh.  That ridiculous.  Carpin's respawn timer is relatively short, making
it easy for a whole guild to get flagged.  And it's in the guild's own
interests to get flagged.  Why make 'em pay to get flagged?  I'd have second
thoughts about being a part of that kinda guild.

Hehehehehehehe.

I think the people who got flagged were the people who already had the PP
targeted.  Many people were just waiting for the officers to decide
something.

This last time, just before we went to kill the HP, a rogue from our
server's uber-guild showed up unannounced and watched us attack the final
three mobs.  Despite the fact that I've grouped with him before and have
thought him to be an all-right sort of guy, I couldn't help feeling worried
that he was going to run up to the PP and spam-hail it until it depopped.
Of course he did nothing of the sort.  Sometimes I can be a bit paranoid
about our uber-guild.  =)

Jeeze.  That would have been bad... I'm glad they changed that.  Guess that
was also a good way to keep a guild from progressing.

lol.  That's certainly how I felt when I got rampaged.

Ooh, good idea.

Heh.  Some of my guildmates would have thoroughly enjoyed the thought of
sharing a hot tub with someone like Saryrn who's clearly into S&M.

And I was there during the key quest.  Hour after hour of getting lousy raid
experience trying to get a named mob to spawn.  Lord Gimblox all over again.

Ah.  Good to know.

Thanks for the info... we found out that the reason we didn't get
transported to the maze is because we haven't killed Bertoxx yet.  We killed
Saryrn waaaay out of order.  So right now the guild priority is killing
Bertoxx.  We're just trying to get people caught up on Grummus / Ulthor
flags.

I'm somewhat wondering if we're not hopelessly entangled now that we have so
many people with Saryrn flags without Bertoxx flags.  We'll find out.
Possible petition inc.  =)

Well, also keep in mind that we're fairly gimp.  We're a guild that *just*
got into Vex Thal, and in fact on Sunday we did our first loot-gathering
raid.  We killed two of the mobs left up by our uber-guild, and I got a
bracer with an extended range focus effect - my first piece of VT loot, and
one of only two such VT loots in our guild.  We tried to get to the other
two loot-dropping mobs, but repeatedly wiped trying to get through a narrow
hallway connecting two wings of the palace.  We're still working out our
strategy for clearing that place, and it needs refinement.

The point being that we're fairly well equipped on Ssra-level loot, but that
still leaves us well short of your average uber-guild.  According to Magelo,
I have 4200 mana, which is more than most of the other clerics in my guild.
But again, it leaves me way behind what your average VT-equipped cleric has.

The same can be said of our tanks; they probably have much less DPS than
uber-guild tanks.  So while we can still kill Saryrn and the like, I don't
think we'll be capable of Rallos Zek for a long time - not until we can get
everyone's equipment updated.  I still don't know how we can even begin to
handle someone who hits for 3500 *and* has a lot of hit points.
