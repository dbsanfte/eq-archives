I did. According to Alakazam's, there is nothing one can kill to improve faction and, according to Alakazam's, you must be at least
amiable (I think it was amiable. Whatever it was, was better than dubious, which is what she cons now.) to be able to complete the

Was wondering if maybe I missed something or if anyone knows of something not listed there.
