Brewing is, hands down, the cheapest to GM.  Jewelcraft is easier, but more
expensive.  Brewing you can take to 248 on vendor purchased items only, no
enchanting, no foraging, no farming.  Jewelcraft you can take to 250 from
vendor purchased items, and you only need two items per combine.  If you
don't enchant the metal first, it gets quite expensive, if you do, the cost
is not too bad.
