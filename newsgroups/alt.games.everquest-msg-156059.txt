LOL, I can tell you're not used to caring about stats on shields. :-p
SBS is ac25 (actually that's about 40 displayed ac, maybe that's where
your number comes from) with some stats on it, incl. 10mr/fr/cr, 40hp,
and some sta.  They're very cheap these days, under 1kpp, and I still
use one anyway because I haven't seen anything with a better combination
of ac/hp/resists that didn't cost more than the GDP of some small
countries.
