That's odd, I am having very little difficulty making pristines at and 
above my level for tiers 3 in Sagecraft and provisioning.  I do get some 
failures, but my success rate is 70% or so for level 22 spells (my 
current level as a Sage), and is 95% or better for level 24 provisions 
(started doing them at level 21).

If I were to end up quitting EQ2, I'd go back to playing more EQ1 I 
expect.
