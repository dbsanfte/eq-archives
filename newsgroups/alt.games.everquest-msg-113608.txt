I don't spell check my posts because its something that isn't important to
me.

Its great that you apply your high standards to everything you do, but I
prefer to lighten up when I don't *need* to be formal.

There are more important things in my life to worry about, then worry if I
made a typo in alt.games.everquest

Sure, which is why I make the extra effort when im writing presentations,
technical documentation, user guides and letters to my bank manager.

I appreciate your input, but it really isnt needed.  What I write for
business purposes doesn't reflect on what I write for alt.games.everquest,
and vice versa.

If you want to judge me based on a game discussion board, your more then
welcome to.. it goes in 1 ear and out the other

If you wish to judge me based on code and documentation that I have written,
you will see a different reaction and response.

code, when it's entirely
