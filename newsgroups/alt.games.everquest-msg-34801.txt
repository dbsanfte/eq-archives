Inside the fort, not inside the walls. Loot inside the fort is great,
several plat a kill, fine steels, some items, gems. 
Loot inside the walls, a few copper a kill, gems like amber and
hematite. EXP is about equal. Which would you choose?
Caveat: inside, dungeon like, trains and AE overpulls galore. Get a
good group.
