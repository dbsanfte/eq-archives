All the players would be warned, suspended, and/or banned for zone
disruption. Raiding a city is one thing. Rendering it totally unusable
by constantly killing everything as it spawns is greif tactics, plain
and simple. Calling it "roleplaying" is lame-ass excuse making and
only ruining the images of the real roleplayers.
