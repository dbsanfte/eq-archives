Congratulations!  :)
We've had plenty of Paladin, Wizard, Monk, Druid, and Ranger bitching
lately, but really the Clerics have been tremendously underrepresented.
Your cute little poke has brought them blinking out into the daylight
and thus contributed some much needed variety to the group (there's
nothing more boring than the same old whines repeated endlessly).  Now
if you could just get the SKs and Necros going, and encourage the BLs
and Mages to increase their contributions, we'd be approaching a truly
equal opportunity whine-vironment (any cheese retailers out there?).
