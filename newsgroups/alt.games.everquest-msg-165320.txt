Ok... I have to ask. What level is your cleric now, are you in a guild,
and if so, what level of capability is the guild? (i.e. do you raid, in
which zones, do you kill Kunark dragons, etc. etc.)

The reason I ask is that, if you are a cleric and were unaware of the
effect on your classes epic thus far, you may not be of a level to even
consider starting the quest.
