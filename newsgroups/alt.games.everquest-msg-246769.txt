Gotcha... the police should search your house randomly without warrant 
or warning, day or night, rain or shine. I mean come on... what the fuck 
difference does it make? You got stuff to hide?

Or maybe Microsoft, Sony, and RIAA/MPAA inspectors should be able to 
install cameras in all the rooms in your home... not to spy on you... 
just to make sure you aren't violating any of your license agreements or 
doing anything that might infringe copyright law.

Privacy loss is a slippery slope biz. Or maybe you support the "homeland 
defense initiatives"... I hope they never blanket suspect people in some 
demographic you fall into of being involved with terrorism...
