IMHO I believe Verant took the numbers down in preparation of DAoC's
arrival.  This way no-one can look up server populations and say "Wow, way
more people are playing DAoC so I think I'll play that instead".  Granted I
wouldn't jump ship myself, but this little move is enough to place people in
the dark about population comparisons.  So far they have been reigning
supreme in the world of MMORPG's and with many more arriving, showing
slipping membership isn't good business practice.
