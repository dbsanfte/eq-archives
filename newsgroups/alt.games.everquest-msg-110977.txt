Funny, I see every single one of the groups you cited get criticized
for their points of view, just as the Christians do. I suspect you're
wearing some selective blinders.

So, attempting to disrupt a Wiccan ceremony may very well have been a
correct Christian thing to do after all. You described those people in
another post as "hate-mongers, who blaspheme Christ's name with their
actions". It seems to me that their actions were right in line with
the vengeful "suffer not a witch to live" god of the Old Testament.

No doubt Reverend Pricer and the other God-fearing Christians who
disrupted the Wiccan ceremony felt that they were being responsible
Christians.

I grow more wary of Christianity with every post.

Rest assured, I judge it solely on the actions of its members.
