And you have to be their roughly 2.5 of them. So 2 raids one week, 3 the 
next, plus XP&AA grinding time, and factioning, and camping drops, 
farming cash, etc on your own time will push the 'requirement' to 3.5 to 
4 evenings at the very least... which averages to over half your free 
time is required in EQ in order to be in good standing.

I don't spend over half my time doing ANYTHING. Everquest of all things, 
is far from worth over half my available free time. (But that's my 
judgement call)

10 weeks is 40 raids. 60% of 40 is 24, not 12. But no matter.

2.4 raids per week in fact, well over 'just over 2'. And again that 
doesn't factor in 'on your own time' activities.

But the point is this guild actively doesn't want people who only raid 
twice a week. People like this will rapidly entrench themselves at 50% 
with no hope of ever being in good standing, no hope of ever being 
eligible for anything. They're better off elsewhere. That's my point.
