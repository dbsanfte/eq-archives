Jesus man, lighten up.  I never ATTACKED anyone so quit being so
melodramatic about it.   My original comment was not intended to be
mean spirited in the first place, and I am willing to bet that his
friend who combined quest armor in trade kit wouldnt have disagreed
with the distinction I gave him anymore that I would have each time I
combined an entire tailoring kit full of top notch arrows components
because I wasnt willing to move some of my more expensive stuff into
the kit to make room in a normal bag.  Took me 4 times to learn that
maybe I should work on Fletching when I have more room in my inventory
so I dont get "happy clicking syndrome".  And each time I made myself
Idiot of the Day.

We all deserve it at different times, including his friend, and we all
wear it well.

Again, lighten up.  My original comment was said with a smile on my
face and laughing in disbelief.

If I came across in some other fashion to you I apologize.

Now lets not make a federal case out of this, there are plenty of
those in this group already.
