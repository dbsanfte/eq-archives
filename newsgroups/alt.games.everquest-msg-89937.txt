I find soloing my bard pretty trivial at 51. Not that I bother, cos the xp
in groups is faster. I dont think ive had any stage in my 51 levels when
soloing had been hard. Ive used fear kiting mainly, but Ive heard charm
works well. At 51, im a bit too high for my manaless charm song.

Bards need good equipment, whereas necros and druids can solo naked at high
levels. Best soloer at high levels is a wizard (quad kiting, makes the druid
look weak), but I imagine getting there is not fun.
