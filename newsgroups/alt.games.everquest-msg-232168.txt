Heh, me too. :)

}Is it me or is there somewhat of a shortage for decent int caster
}pants (mostly enchanter)? Sure there are some good items - but the
}selection compared to other slots seems pretty thin. I have the Sandy
}pants that you recommended to the OP - pretty nice and fairly cheap. I
}also have the drop for the Candy pants from Thurg quest. Not sure I
}wanna waste time to get a 15 sec casting time C1 when Im very close to
}AA-Gather mana. Even after a rez, I can sit and med up to a C1's mana
}requirement in less than 15 secs. I suppose to just say I did it
}(whoopie).

Ahh, you're totally missing the purpose of these pants.  I had the 
skyshrine version.  What they're for is when your sub-45 friend wants c1 
and you don't want to bother actually sitting and memming the spell.  
Think of it as a ninth spell slot when you're PLing people. :)

Honestly, though, I recall having SS legs and not wearing them.  I can't 
remember for sure, but I think I had Hate legs that I liked better.  Now 
I've got some boring BoT drop I can't even remember the name of, but the 
stats are decent. :)
