I've read many articles. None of them state that this was ever intended for
the US.

Yes, at a level that they can understand. 2 yr olds can be told that someone
has a disease that keeps their body from being able to fight germs and that
they have to take lots of medications to help their bodies.

Yes I am.  Also have a master's degree in developmental psychology and have
worked with kids for 20 years.

If I am employed to supervise/educate children than it is most certainly my
job to eliminate any false information or prejudgments they have concerning
others based on this false information.  It is most certainly my job to
provide them with correct, factual information to situations which they
encounter while in my care.

I would not abdicate that to my TV because I do discuss things like this
with my children, so there is no need to do so.  I do feel, however, that TV
should have characters such as individuals with AIDS (or asthma, or CP, or
MS, or autism, or who are homosexual or, Muslim even Wiccan) because these
people exist in the world around us.
