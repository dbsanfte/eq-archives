no, not illiterate, just couldn't care to spend more then 0.5 sec typing a
response to that post.

see whne u type fast sometimes u makr mistak3s

and, do you not agree that guns are for pussies? real men fight with fists,
not guns...

like the rippers in tank girl... they were taught by jonnie prophet to fight
without the corruption of guns and emerged victorious against the evil water
and power corp!!!

"guns dont kill people, people kill people".....sure, but without guns it
would be harder.
so, replace guns with rocks, and you have more people surviving attacks
against them.

less guns = less people dying !  stupid!!

3m s0 sm4rt!!!!!!
