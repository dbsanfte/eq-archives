I don't think he's talking about voluntary prayer.  If he is, I would have
no problem hearing a muslim saying a prayer, as long as he doesn't pray for
the death of all us infidels... of course, I also wouldn't want to hear a
Baptist pray for God to kill all us godless heathens, either.  As far as a
buddhist prayer or Hindu... why not?  Though, I imagine things would get
quite loud with all the different religions doing their thing at the same
time.  Just as long as the Mormons don't get to say anything.  Tunare knows
what those guys would do.

Anything other than voluntary must come from the government, whether it's
mandated by congress or the principal.  That would be unconstitutional.
