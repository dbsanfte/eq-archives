Naw. They're just trying to save their asses. The ones who *really* bitch the
loudest are the parents trying to cover for the fact that they didn't have a
fucking clue about discipline, had no idea how to raise a child, should have been
neutered/spayed before they spawned, and now have the fucking *nerve* to act upset
and surprised when their little crackhead child blows the teachers face off with a
twelve gauge.

Nope. And he'll probably be a *real* good boy when he get's to the big house. If
he takes up smoking he'll probably never have to pay for a pack of cigs for the
next twenty years.
