You can combine the items anywhere, the only way
it will "not work" is if you have less than the
correct number.  In which case all items in the
pack will be destroyed.

Many quests in the game are like this.  probably
so people don't just use a regular backpack or
something to turn in the quest items.

When you combine it it will still look like a
pack, but is no longer a container.  it is now an
item.  The only way to keep the backpack is to not
do the quest.  Many people use these newbie quest
backpacks until they can afford a real one from
what i have experienced.
