Uh, yes, it is. You might not like the pejorative tones that come with
that word but it is 100% accurate. You want to log in and start to play,
instantly, without setup time. Saying you want to login and play the
rewarding, gratifying part of the game instantly for an hour without
'wasted' setup time is the very definition of instant gratification.
