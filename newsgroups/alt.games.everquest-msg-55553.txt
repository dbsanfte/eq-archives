And you are harmed or hurt how by not being able to inspect someone? It is
not sometimes the actual act of inspecting but the responses of some players
after they inspect me. I get tells all the time to buy or give an item I am
wearing and it would make some players experience much less of a hassle if
they did not have to slip a pair of leather pants on when they go to sell
simply to keep players from hassling them to sell the gatorscale legs they
are wearing?

Again I ask why do you need to know if I am wearing a leather tunic or Tree
weave unless we are on a PvP server and you are going to fight me. Even that
is pretty weak because I could be wearing leather at first and slip on a
Tree weave when the fight starts.

You can not use your analogy because there is no way it is the same. If you
claim it is then it can also be claimed that there are several items of
clothing that look exactly alike in real life that have no outward tag and
the only way is to inspect the lining tag. Does not work in real life so no
comparison. It is simply a game and I fail to see why anyone would object to
a non PvP player from having the option to not have other players inspect
them.
