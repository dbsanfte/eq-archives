I was very upset by a faction difficlty I had with my first ogre shaman at 
about level 15 and started a second.  The problem basically turned out to 
be that I just don't like shamaning all that much, though.  So now I 
basically have two ogre shaman mules.  I should really get around to 
deleting one. :)

I've also done a lot of 'second attempt' characters on other servers that 
it turned out I had RL friends on.  It's amazing how quickly doing the 
same thing again gets really, really old.
