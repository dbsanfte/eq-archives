My 43rd enchanter is still having a blast in Overthere. I know I'm too
high for the zone now but with sow potions I can run around and charm
kite and nuke non stop. I usually guage when to stop by how much mana
or health I have left....1 bubble of mana = 1 more kill and 1 bubble
of health = sit and med for a while. When I was running ahead to get
within root range of a sarnak knight and a spiked cactus after charm
broke I was suprised to get a kindly complete heal from the High
Priest as he walked by. Im used to goons ks'ing me but this heal was a
pleasant suprise. Now when the goons come out I can push my xp limits
a bit further by doing a few more charm kites (which will inevitably
cause me a few hits) then when im less than a bubble of health just
tash a cactus and run in circles around the priest then he heals me.
This would rock for a CoB necro cause for them health = mana. I love
being an agnostic Erudite polymorphing enchanter!

btw .... Im still getting 2 blues per four mana bubbles so at 43 its
easy xp pickings. In a couple levels my resists should be low enough
for me to do the same in DL but the damn spiders and dogs run so fast
and are aggro to my fire elemental illusion......not to mention Gore
frowns on illusions. Anyone know a similar place for a mid 40's
chanter to charm kite and root/nuke solo?
