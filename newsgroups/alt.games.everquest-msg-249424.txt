Sounds like you have the account started, it's just asking for billing 
info now right?

Are you sure the game card was brand new?  Sometimes they try to resell 
them too.  Sony is very good about not taking your money until the day 
it's due, don't be afraid to give them your CC info.  If you want you 
can give them a CC to start the game then immediately cancel the 
subscription (go into accounts on the menu and cancel, do this after 
you've logged all the way in for the first time).  If you do it that 
way, you'll still get the original 30 days, on the 30th day it'll lock 
you out.

Another thing, how old is your son?  EQOA may seem like it would be a 
good idea for a child but it's not.  All ages play the game and young 
unsupervised children will be much in danger.  You don't know who it 
could be talking to your kid, there could be a pedophile looking out for 
fresh meat.  Not saying I've really met any pedophiles in game but it 
does happen.  No one watches thier language, the language does get R or 
even X-rated many times.

If you do allow your child to play, please please please supervise him.  
He has to learn to keep his temper, not to steal from other players, 
cooperate with other players, not to take monsters and dump them on 
other players to get them killed.
