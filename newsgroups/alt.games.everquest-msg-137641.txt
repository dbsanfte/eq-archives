    Where do you fight him? I've seen a few people on The Safehouse say they
pull him into the room with the portal. We don't do that. He's positioned on
the staircase in the hall to his room, facing away from the portal room
(pinned to the wall). The casters are on the bottom of that hallway, and are
therefore behind him (and never get hit with the AoE - front arc only). So
yeah, we'd normally get the repops in the hall. And hopefully everyone stays
away from the door back into the portal room. That seems to be the common
theme in Luclin encounters - a raid leader screaming "STAY AWAY FROM THE
REAR DOOR!"

    As for what charm they're using, that I don't know - but I do know they
re-charm them and send them back in. So I'd think that would exclude
Dictate.
