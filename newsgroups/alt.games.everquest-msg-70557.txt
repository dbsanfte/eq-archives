I have noticed that my zone and load times are faster after enabling texture
compression and caching.  It takes a long time for the first initial zone-in
into any zones I haven't been in in since starting.

my question.

If I re-zone into the zone I just cached for the first time...it is just as
slow.  I seem to think that if I re-zone after I have logged and restarted
EQ, it is much quicker.

My theory is that EQ needs a restart in order to see the new cache files on
the harddrive.

Anyone know if this is correct or if Verant has commented on this>

Thanks
