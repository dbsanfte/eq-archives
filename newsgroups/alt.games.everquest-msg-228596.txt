There could be times that youd be useful. In a party without and enchanter
or shaman, and no kei, they might want you for mana and haste song. I dont
know how reliable or effective bard lull is, but you might be able to pull
ok. As for fighting or mezzing, or slowing... I dont think you would be very
effective at the usual camps. Razorfiends and golems are over level 60.
Stick with tier1 for now.
