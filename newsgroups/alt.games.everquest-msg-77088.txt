I own one and I'd never consider using it inplace of a keyboard for EQ. It
is only marginally useful for FPS games, IMO.
Yes it would work with EQ, you program it's buttons to be key presses (and
multiple key presses, macro's if you will) then designate what game (or exe
file) that setup is for. Give it a try but in a game where you will want to
commincate with people a lot I wouldn't have thought this was much use.
