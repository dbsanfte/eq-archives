I have characters on both (Stromm would have to be considered my second 
main, I suppose) that I haven't played in quite some time. Any regulars 
from those servers care to speak up on what the populations are like there 
these days? My highest level on Stromm is a 40 shaman, while on MS I'm 
still in my mid-20's. I dinked around a bit on both recently, and, though I 
can't expect to know much in just an evening or two, it seemed that MS was 
a bit more populous than Stromm.

Anyone else wanna chime in?
