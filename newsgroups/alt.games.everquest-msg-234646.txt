Whilst in a group on Saturday night there was me (warrior), mage and a
bard pulling nicely getting some nice xp. Along came a ranger so we
invited him in he then proceed to start pulling so I ask him not to as
he is drawing too many adds as does the mage, he does not answer and
carries on so after nearly getting wiped out on three or four
occasions (mage died twice) myself and the mage break up the group as
the bard has to log anyway.
Short time later I am still in the zone and I watch this guy create
train after train, he eventually comes unstuck and gets stuck in a
part of the zone which is one hard to get too and hes theres yelling
for help so I decide not to, my reason you pull it you deal with it.
He then begins to hurl tells at me for not helping this goes on for a
while until I decide to ignore him. So correct or not?
