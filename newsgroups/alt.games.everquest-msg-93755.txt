Originally, it wasn't possible to code it so NPCs could zone given
EQ's engine at the time, I think. When they made Luclin, they figured
out a way to do it. The pets are essentially buffs on the character
whose effects are NPC pets. Might have only been possible through
enhancements in the engine. Why weren't magicians, necromancers, etc
given the ability to have their pets zone? Because it was decided to
be a special ability of the Beastlords and Wizards (Familiars aren't
technically pets, but let's not split hairs).
