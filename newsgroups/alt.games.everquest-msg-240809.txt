conspiratorially whispered:

And yet Andrew the bigot just said Canadians were "Americans without
brains". Andrew is caught lying AGAIN.

Andrew is challenged to find me saying anything bigoted, ever,
anywhere. I have already shown Andrew himself to be a bigot. Andrew is
caught lying AGAIN.

>

>
>I don't just Sisson

Andrew lies again.


>> Have you been racist long? 
>
>I wasn't aware that Sissons' were a race. 

Andrew lies again.

Andrew is a lying, bigotted, hypocritical tosser.
