"Dan Day"

Btw Dan, did you ever read Hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy? The bit about the
only person qualified to rule as leader of anything are those who expressly
do not want to do it? I think it was one of the most accurate pbservations
made in a long time.

Two people top my list of ideal leaders, Nelson Mandella and that president
of East Timor, umm, X-Gusmou or whatever his name is. Any person with half a
brain can see they are both completely past any sort of ambition, and are
just *tired* of what life has thrown at them (but not <beaten>).

They would like nothing better than retire to a nice peaceful life but don't
have the luxury. They have something I never had: ideals, values and ethics.
I think that if either one of them were *able* to retire they would be the
happiest golf club members around....
