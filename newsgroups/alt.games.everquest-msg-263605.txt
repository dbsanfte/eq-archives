You didn't buyt EQ2 yet Wolfie, did you ?

Dick, you seem to confuse design and code. You can make a game with a
modular design, and still hand optimize each module and the way they "talk"
to each other. Modular doesn't mean you're going to use DCOM or CORBA. I'm
pretty sure DOOM 3 IS modular : I bet we'll soon see is 3D engine reused in
other games.

As for MMORPG, with all the patches and the expansions they need, I'm pretty
sure they are ALL modular.
