Just pointing out that there are a lot of people that don't care what
you're wearing. They might just think it's fun to kill someone, or
consider you a threat, wearing gear or not.

Inspection prior to a PK attempt becomes more rare the higher level
you go. When they're unguilded and in range, it's often a sign that
you may want to initiate the fight.
