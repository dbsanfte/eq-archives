Except they weren't exactly secrets. Question isn't who knew them, but
who didn't know them?

I don't dismiss that hostile action would likely have been needed
against Sadaam in the end. I do think that all other reasonable
options hadn't been exhausted. There was no clear evidence that he
posed a real threat to us or anyone outside his country. Not since
Desert Storm.

Actually, most yes. Talk to your average British. If they don't
outright hate us, they think we're pig-headed. We definitely have a
higher self-image than we should... I'm all for patriotism, but
there's a line between being patriotic and being arrogant.

Valid reason isn't the question. The line of logic you presented could
be used for an excuse.

Lying and using that lie to send our troops into hostile territory to
be killed, to likely give terrorist groups more reason to attack us,
and piss off a good portion of the rest of the world endangers
national security. As I matter of fact, I'd say sending our troops in
as a "first strike" without solid evidence of a threat was more of a
threat to national security than Sadaam posed -- it made us out to be
the aggressors, and has likely poured fuel on the fire of
anti-American sentiment that most major terrorist groups in that part
of the world have.

>What was leaked?

The identity of an undercover operative was leaked to the press. The
reasons aren't known, but speculation is that it was done as a form of
punishment. The press official it was leaked to wasn't informed that
the operative was still active and that the information would pose a
threat to him or his family.

The identities of active CIA operatives is just as much national
security as arms information.
