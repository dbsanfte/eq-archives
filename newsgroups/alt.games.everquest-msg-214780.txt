From the shadows, the mysterious "Richard Lawson" <nouma@msn.com> (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

Disagree completely. I think LDoN will see less time than any other
expansion with the possible exception of LoY. It's *terrible* for the
casual player, given you have to commit a solid two hours without even
the option of going afk unless you want to screw your group over - and
thats assuming you can even find a group right away willing to take
you in.

The best thing for the casual player were the permanent pickup spots
like PoV's outer caves etc. This is not casual gamer friendly, though
this may be masked at the moment as we are in the expansion rush.

This expansion is also heralding the comeback of dps over all. Yes I
know you can succeed with less than perfect setups. But more and more,
as people see what's required, they are refusing to take suboptimal
group combinations because its just not worth the time commitment,
which is larger than any other single EQ activity besides full scale
raiding.

It was a further move in the dumbing down of EQ, yes. I remember
talking a couple years ago sarcastically about whiny people who wanted
the mobs lined up in front of them as they logged in, so they wouldn't
have to move or think or anything, just kill. Little did I know it was
coming true.


>Big thumbs-up to Sony; this expansion all by itself will keep EQ viable for
>at least a couple of years to come.

I suspect people will tire of it faster than any expansion other than
LoY, which at least gave us some UI goodies.

This expansion is by far the biggest proof that EQ has moved away from
what made it great in the first place, and instead seems to be wanting
to become Diablo.
