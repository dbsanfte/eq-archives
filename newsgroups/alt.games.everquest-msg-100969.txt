"can u port me plz?"

"can u rez me plz?"

"I am sorry but I can no longer offer those services. The gods have
deemed that my time in the world is more expensive and I'm guessing
that making it more expensive only makes sense if they are taking over
their duties themselves so at this time what you should do is:

/petition I need a rez and a port plz, someone told me the 3 bucks
more a month must be to pay for that

good day!"

"what?"

"kk thnx"

Later:

"that not work.. it two hours no one talk me.." 

"What the sam hell? Well heads are going to roll because my 3 dollars
better be paying for something!"

"what?"
