Here's what I know.  Some background information first.

I had solo'd with my rogue alt/twink for as much as I could between
groups in Lake of Ill Omen.  I try to make the best out of every skill
he had available (well, except poisons).  Equipped a snare dagger from
Lower Guk and began smashing the intimidation button once it procced. 
From constant button smashing while soloing (or otherwise grouping =P )
my skill should be up around the 120-140 range.

Now, to add to what everyone else has said (too much for me to read,
gah!), here's how I've studied how Intimidation, or Instill Doubt as it
was once called, works.

You initiate the ability and you begin to go through a series of
actions, which do nothing.  If the Intimidation works you will kick at
the very end.  This is the first check in the Intimidation.  The next
check is if the kick lands or not.  If the kick does hit the target
then your kick will proc a fear spell, which leads to the next check -
Fear/Magic resist.  If your Intimidation works, your kick lands, and
the target doesn't resist the fear spell, then you're all good to chase
the target around and smack it (In my rogue's case, it'll be snared and
I'll be backstabbing it).  At that point all that's left is to hope
that the random duration of fear spells don't fail you!
