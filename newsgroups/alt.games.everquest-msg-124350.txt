Loot's a matter of perspective. A bloodpoint would still be a huge
upgrade for my warrior's arsenal for certain encounters. And even if
not, they are still selling for many KPP on our server. Other examples
exist. I mean, if you're fully ToV/ST equipped and raiding VT, then
yeah. I'm sure it's lame. But for 95% of us, the stuff that can drop in
HS is fairly impressive.
