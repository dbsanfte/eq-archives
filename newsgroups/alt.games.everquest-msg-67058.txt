I take longer to get into the game than I used to, I was having a lot of
slow down last night, but apart from that there has been little noticeable
change..I gues my busy threshold for graphics has dropped a little.

I see lots of new pretty armour types, in more details...I've yet to see
someone who looks badly mismatched....though I am not using the SoL models
just EQ/RoK/SoV with new engine.

Used to take 5-8 before from double clicking the desktop EQ icon, now as
you, 7-10 to get in. Never had lock up or crash on login, zoning was
alittle longer...the cutback of 10 secs they announced seems to have done
20 for me.

Turnign close to a wall has become a time where I will notice grpahic
freezes.....dungeons are therefore more likely to give me
problems...outside zones no problem whatsoever even close to walls.

Cnclusion...there has been ugrading, I can detect it on my machine and I
now have an excuse to go get that extra memory, and to overclock the
Celery in my machine (heck its out of warranty date anyway :)
