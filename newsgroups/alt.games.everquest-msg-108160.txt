Okay.  Then I'll pose my question to you directly.  HOW does the effect of a
Fungi Tunic affect you DIRECTLY?  Is it because you dont have or cannot
afford one?  This is NOT an issue of whether or not you can afford one, as I
too was in a position where I was only WISHING I could own one.  But, as
time went on and my level got higher, I EARNED mine and the RIGHT to use it
as I see fit.  That is, to totally skip the bat, fire beetle, orc 1 in EC,
dune tarant's in NRO, etc BS.  This has ALWAYS stopped for me at around
level 40, since afterall, using it after that point REALLY is useless IMO.
Mobs hit too hard and I would rather have my higher AC, STA, etc BP/Robe on.

Are you going to complain it creates an unexperienced player?  Again, that
depends upon the person.  Honestly, it takes NO genius to -effectively- play
ANY class in EQ.  With that said, draw your own conclusions.
