Try the store bought wooden flute.  I had trouble with "raw bamboo" which claimed that
it is a wind instrument... I'd never get skill ups with it.  But with the store bought wooden
flute I do.  Maybe there's the same problem with the minotaur horn??

I've never found much use for wind instruments except for the invis song (at least to level 47
anyway).

And the "you missed a note bringing your song to a halt" message will still frequently
occur at a skill of 235.  So don't count on getting rid of those annoying misses till you get AA points
in instrument mastery.
