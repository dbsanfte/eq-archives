I used to work customer support. About the worst call I ever was on
was one where I was trying to help a field-user with his hand-held
computer. Along the way, I told him to press zero. He then asked me if
I meant "the letter zero, or the number oh?"

Of course, he wasn't stupid in his line of work - from what I learned
over the years, he was quite good at it. He was just mostly illiterate
(all too common in that area of the country), and very nervous around
computers.
