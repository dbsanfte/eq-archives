What I usually do is go to http://eq.castersrealm.com/menu/research.asp this
will show you what spell your rune, page, word etc is for and you can then
decide if it is worth holding. If I find I looted an item for a 49th spell,
I generally try to hold onto it for the people in my guild.

If you are under 40 or so, the things you are killing are probably dropping
common research items, and you'd be best off selling them to a vendor unless
you have a friend who is an INT caster and needing the item you looted.

If you are 50+ lots of the items dropped by 50+ mobs are semi-uncommon and
you might want to hang onto them for your friends or your guild.
