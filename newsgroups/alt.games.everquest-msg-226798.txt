More properly, endurance will be a pool based on other stats (likely
STA, but who knows what else) much the way mana is a pool based on
INT or WIS and +mana, and HP is a pool based on level, class, aa, +HP 
and STA.

This pool replaces the Stamina pool that was used while swimming, 
swinging weapons and jumping.  Of the actions that used to drain this
pool, jumping will now drain the endurance pool.

I'm curious, however, whether going hungry will drain this pool the
way it does the current stamina pool.
