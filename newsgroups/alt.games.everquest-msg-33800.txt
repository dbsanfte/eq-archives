There are a couple of quests that you can do.

In rivervale there is the Pirana quest there is also a quest in volving
a lost gem that gets you a weapon. 
...
Hold on while I look them up
...
List of rivervale quests :
http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/qsearch.html?zone=12

I recommend :
http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/quest.html?quest=51
Which can get you :
http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/item.html?item=356
2hs (4/24) which is rubbish for fighting, but a great way to get 2hs up.
The other part of the quest gets you good xp to get to level 7/8

Also do :
http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/quest.html?quest=49
While you are there.

http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/quest.html?quest=55
This is a good way to make some cash.
You can do it every time you leave the town.

There are also some quests in misty :
http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/quest.html?quest=660
http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/quest.html?quest=658
These 2 are probably the best, but you need a few levels first.

Hope that this increases your enjoyment.

The pirana tooth quests are a great way to level fast, just ask my
druid.
Oh and your swimming will improve.

HTH,

Jim
You can then move on to :
http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/quest.html?quest=59
http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/quest.html?quest=63
http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/quest.html?quest=56
http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/quest.html?quest=57
