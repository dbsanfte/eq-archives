I feel the need to point out here that the first amendment has fuck
all to do with private business arrangements.  San is paying for a
service.  He feels that is a degradation in his service that Cox
carries these groups.  Whether or not you or I agree with this point
is irrelevant.  He is in the right to request that Cox stop carrying
these groups.  Cox is in no way obligated to comply with the request
if they don't feel like it though.  And push comes to shove, Cox's
feelings on the matter will come down to money.  Where will they lose
more: Sanjain taking his business elsewhere or the revenue generated
by the users who are accessing the groups in contention.

At no point in this are anybodies first amendment rights being
trampled on.  Nobody has the RIGHT to access any newsgroups from Cox's
servers and Cox is not required to carry particular groups just so
people can access them from a Cox account.  If you don't like the way
Cox runs their business (like me, but for different reasons) you can
take your business elsewhere.  And I can guarantee that someone
somewhere will be more than happy to take your money for said service.
