Ghost killing is basically to kill a mob without getting harmed at
all.  A good example is to solo overlord mata muram and still not need
a heal or anything.  It works mainly by manipulating the world
geometry (ie putting player under world) where mob can't fight back or
using warp to get next to the mob, deliver blows then pop away before
the mob could react.

SOE has everything on log and once they figure out how to plug the
exploit, they will do a search of the log for every references to
someone using or abusing the exploit and banning the accounts.  They
did it before with warp hack, using MQ for Win, etc.
