If anything it probably gets a little easier to solo. Same with a druid.
The faction is a mixed blessing. Overthere is a great place to hunt from
30-44 or so, and its the "good" races that will be KOS there, and also its
very convenient being able to bank at ogguk if youre hunting in rathe
mountains.

Tanking for your pet is a great idea at lower levels. Keep it up as long as
you can, the more defense skill, the better.

Keep your eyes out for words of possession, detachment, and allure, as
you'll need these to make the 24 pet (research only). Make the trip and get
leach and banshee aura, they both rock.
