from a post on my guild board:

Like foraging, fishing only counts if it's 101 or better, before then
you can't get rares (like the Seaweed for Sea Tempers, or the Cobalt
Cods for Cod Oil, or the Iceclad Cutlassfish for the Shawl quest).  For
those that don't know, normal races need 101 or better foraging to
forage rares (like Oak Bark and Drake Eggs), except for Iksar who can
all forage, have 50 skill that never goes up and can always forage rares
(though they fail to get anything at all lost of times, due to low
skill).
