Hi:

Macros are great fun, and can be used to do many things, but sadly I'm
finding that the five lines available to me in the edit box are not
enough.Is there *any* way that I can add extra lines to a macro, even if
it's done by editing the macro file on my PC itself, though I have no idea
where this file is on my PC?

If not, is there a way that I can make a marco that will play two other
macros one after another, or in other words, can I set up macro number one
to play macro's two and three one after the other?


Many thanks in advance ...

Stevie.
