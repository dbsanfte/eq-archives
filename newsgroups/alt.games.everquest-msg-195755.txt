But the corallary is "don't use the unpaid volunteers to defend the company
from the suggestion that the testing is incomplete"

They aren't being paid.  So a) its not really their responsibility.  And b)
The company should consider paying if unpaid isn't cutting the mustard.

That said, I believe the point you are responding to is not that the
volunteers did a crappy job, but that they weren't even presented a fair
chance to do so; changes on test two days before they go live?  With that
small a test population?  Are we really to believe that a really good job of
testing out the changes is -possible- under those circumstances?

I don't know, perhaps its quite possible.  Maybe thats plenty of time.  But
whether it is or not, I think thats the issue at stake, not the straw man
argument that the unpaid volunteers should be blamed (and then your response
to that straw man, which misses the actual point)
