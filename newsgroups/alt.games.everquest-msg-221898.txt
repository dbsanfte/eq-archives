So after 2-3 hours of working your 35 man raid to the boss mob, the raid
wipes because a couple of essential people happened to go link dead when
the fight started, and you want to penalize the other 33 people not
only by making that 2-3 hours a complete waste of time but by making
them take an unrezzable death as well.

Erm, bullshit. The penalty is the most precious thing we have, time.
Maybe you put little value on yours but when a raid target in high level
PoP zones requires 72 people, a wipe out isnt a matter of cr in the
graveyard and right back to trying again. Between people logging and
needing replacement, rebuffing and getting back to the target, it's
several hours already before you're going to get another chance, and
that's if another guild hasn't already moved in and killed it while you
were waiting for the graveyard to pop. Even an all corpse to the
graveyard wipe is a serious pain in the ass on a high level raid as I'm
sure Monuel and others will attest. Guilds make every effort to get a
cleric camped just to avoid this so called trivialized penalty.
Especially when a few LD's can cause the other 70 people to waste an
hour or so of their time through absolutely no fault of their own.
