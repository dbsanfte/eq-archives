I would start at their main page www.istaria.com.  There is a "Community"
link with some starting sites.  http://hz.warcry.com, http://www.tazoon.com
and work out from there.  I got most of my initial information from WarCry
and Tazoon.

I am not sure on Druid, if I recall the trainer is far to the north, near
Mahagra, further north, out on the ice flows.

The Monk trainer is on a small island just outside the city of Kion.

One thing I found, playing a Paladin was fun, but I got tons more use out of
adding just a little bit of a few other classes.

A Paladin, true to form is part Cleric and part Warrior.  A skill of 150
Life and 200 2-Hand slash is required to become a paladin (Usually obtained
at 15 Cleric and 20 Warrior, but mileage may vary depending on race as there
are slight bonuses there, and if you choose to use your training points
there).

However, I also spent 6 levels as a Monk, as I gained an innate bonus to
Evade at 6 Monk (always nice to avoid a bit more damage), and 8 levels as a
Mage, since I could then put small damage adds of various types on my
weapons, fire, energy, etc.  This also gave me a low level DoT to play with,
as well as a little fire and armor debuff.

I do hope that helps,

Finduilax
