Kjorn is still there, but when I knew I was not going to be playing for
quite a while, or possibly ever again, I gave almost everything on him
back to the person who gave it to me in the beginning. I could create my
Necromancer there if I decide to start one. Time will tell. I still have
vivid memories of casting for 2 solid days to up his spell skills and
only receiving a handful of skill ups.
