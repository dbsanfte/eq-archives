Really the only thing that made my first Hate trip unpleasant was people 
whining about loot. The ranger in my group was going on and on and on and on 
about some stupid whip that drops off a revultant rat (or whatever it's 
called). A ton of cleric armor dropped, and there was some barely disguised 
whining about that as well. It really got on my nerves. I knew I wasn't 
going 
to get anything on the raid.. came away with a diamond in the end 'cause the 
leader handed out rare gems to people who didn't get any of the drops.

I actually came out ahead.. a level 59 or 60 rogue in my group was double 
backstabbing all over the place, and I think I got two blue bubbles out of 
it. 
But, yeah, you definitely don't go for experience.

Yup, I was there to do something new. Going to Fear in two weeks.. might 
even 
get some Shiverback out of the deal. If I don't, I'm definitely not going to 
whine about it! :-)
