Uh huh...and how do you go about doing this?  How much does it cost?  What
hardware is involved?  What software?  Do I have to learn a new OS to do it?
If the answer to the OS is Linux, then yes, you MUST learn the OS before you
can.

Newsreaders (OE) are easy to use.  The first time I ever used one I just
followed the instructions that came with whatever it was that offered it.
The HARD part is setting up a damned group.  How do you go about it?  It's
not like there's a manual laying around handy.

Until such time as someone goes about making Usenet-based possible for the
computer-savvy-but-not-usenet-administrator-savvy person, webboards will
ALWAYS prevail.
