They'll just need to change it back again after the divorce.  Which brings
up splitting of marital assets.  Baybe we could have a divorce command.
Both players would have to agree and then all loot would be split
automatically.  Of course, if there were no agreement, it would have to go
before an EQ arbitrator.  Imagine the arguments...

"You want WHAT?!?  The FBSS and the Horse (the arbitrators won't be around
until Luclin)?  Next I assume you'll be taking the Argent Protector and the
Pearless Dragonhide Breastplate and YOU"RE A FRIGGEN MAGICIAN!"
