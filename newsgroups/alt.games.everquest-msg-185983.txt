Dunno exactly but

lvl 64 needed approx 120,000,000 exp points to ding 65
An AA is always 15,000,000 exp points to Ding

Gives an idea I guess, /shrug... people who choose AA do so of their own
choice. Someone who levels main exp is more usefull to a guild. A lvl 60
wizard is worth lot more than lvl 59 wizard with 30AA IMO
