I'm not supporting anything or anybody,  I'm just pointed out that as Jazz
said it's going to turn into a dick waving contest and in the end it did.

I keep seeing these heated discussions where someones point is belittled as
being stupid or he is belittled as being stupid (yes, it has happened to me)
but from what I can see and I know when I have posted, it is from experience
of playing those characters. Being told a monk or even Shamans can tank as
well as any "tank" class (pally, SK or Warrior)..sorry never played a shaman
but I found monks very puny in that role. SK's can tank as well as a
warrior? well mine couldn't, even twinked. He wasn't crap at it just not as
affective, was far better in a group with a warrior being main tank giving
him the oppotunity to cast as well as melee (ever noticed how hard it is to
cast when getting beat on?) I found this way he bought much more to the
group (to the point where the group were looking for another SK to replace
me) and although I occasionally took aggro off the warrior I never held it.

Most of the comments I post to have been about the sub 50 game (where all my
experience is, I take my time, before you say that 50 took you 2months) but
it would seem that many people are playing a different game (or referring to
uber twinks) when discussing, no, argueing, heatedly, about such matters...I
can't really be bothered with them, tell me I'm wrong with my experiences of
playing such characters..call me a moron for remembering them that
way...I'll just smile and wonder what game I am playing, it doesn't appear
to be EQ.

To add one thing to the OP, Erudite is a great choice for an SK (although
people will tell you Ogre or Troll are best, ignore them, I hate number
crunching in Role Playing games) although underground you are night blind,
outdoors the effect is almost zero now, anyway you get Dead Eye at 22nd.
Look for some flayed skin armour, looks good (well a full suit on a human
will make you look like Prince but any armour on an Erudite looks good) and
gives decent AC at low level and some nice stats, this stuff is very cheap
now with many items going for 50pp. Of course there is far better armour out
there but I'm just thinking of a starting character with low resources, by
mid teens you could have/afford a full suit (if you so wished) of flayed
skin.
