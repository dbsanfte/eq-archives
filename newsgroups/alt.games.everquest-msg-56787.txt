> LOL you post to complain out complainers.

Again, I didn't see anywhere that I complained about
anybody.  Complaining wouldn't be stating an opinion
and a fact about the patches today and in the past.
Complaining would be "Oh FU Verant, I want my
money back because I can't log on right now! We
should all boycott VI and the asses that work there!"

That's a complaint.

"Find something else to do while the patch is going on"
is not a complaint.

Saying that in the past servers and patches were really F'd up
is arrogant?

I'm the atithesis of free-speech?

I told 'em they don't have the right to feel angry?

Um...no.  I did say that complaining wouldn't do any
good...heck, I get frustrated when I can't log on at
night for some reason or other.  But I don't complain
about it.  Here's a hint: It doesn't help anything at all
to complain about patches...game content that's broken,
yeah...complaints can help (not always, re: Alchemy).

Hmmm...considering that I haven't flamed anybody at all today,
I would hope I'm not very  good at it.

Again:

1) "Stop complaining, it does no good and this is nothing compared
    to patch foul-ups in the past" is not a flame.

2) Starting a thread calling somebody a dick is both a pathetic
    attempt at a flame and a troll in the same subject line...pretty
    nifty.

I honestly don't remember a time I flamed anyone, simply
because most things that get said here are just a discussion
and don't raise my BP any.  Why would I flame some guy
because he's angry at the patches?
