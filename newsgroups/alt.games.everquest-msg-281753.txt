I thought I was quite clear.

A spell has a range of 100 'units'.  In one zone, 100 'units' covers how
much distance in terms of /loc co-ordinates.

In another zone, does 100 'units' cover the same distance in /loc
co-ordinates.

100 units on a spell is an absolute distance in the game, whatever you want
to call those units, feet, inches, micrometers, plinks, ticks, whatever.
It's standard.  If you compare two items, one with range 100 and one with
range 200, in a specific zone, the 200 range item has twice the range in
/loc co-ordinates that the 100 range item does.

Huh?  If a bow is range 100, and spell is range 100, they are both useable
at the same range.  That number of items and spells is static and in the
same units.

However, as I tried to say in another post, it's a point of small concern
for me, and I think I'll stop here.
