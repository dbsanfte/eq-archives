I have wanted to come back to Everquest for awhile now.  I understand that
LOY is a download only expansion.  When it downloads, does it come as one
big file that you can back-up onto a CD or does it automatically install
itself?  If it automatically installs then it seems like you would have to
re-download it everytime you reinstalled the game.
