Hmmm.  When I was taught algebra, oh so long ago, the precedence of
operators <was> part of it.  Specificly, multiplication and division
were to be evaluated prior to addition and subtraction, unless
parentheses indicate otherwise.  Please note that when I say "oh so
long ago" I am referring to a time when "C" and Unix were novelties
at Bell Labs, "personal" computers did not exist, and Simula (the
first O-O language) had not yet been invented.  So, to return to the
question, A/B+C evaluates identicly to (A/B)+C, always and without
ambiguity, at least so it was taught in U.S schools (including
universities) in the '60s and '70s.  Computer languages adopted and
extended the idea of operator precedence from this pre-existing
convention already used in algebra.
