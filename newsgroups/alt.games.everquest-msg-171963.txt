I can't imagine you are unable to solo green chromodracs, screw your buffs, root
and nuke em to death.  The DOT is a bit of a pain, or would be except that they
turn around and dispell it for you right away!  If you go in unbuffed, then
whenever dispell lands on you and you aren't dotted, nothing happens, and every
time it lands when you Are dotted, boom, dot gone!

Better plan, though, is  to fear kite their annoying butts into the stone age.
As with other dispelling mobs, this is really a key strategy, as when feared
they aren't casting anything, including the dreaded dispell.  So get a snaring
partner or pick up a sap encrusted branch and do the work yourself.

As with any farming of greens, this is going to be tedious work.  For best
results, find an epicless cleric buddy, and an epicless bard.  Bard can run
snares for you, and you may be able to spawn Eldrig the Old for him (PH is most
likely a chromodrac, sadly, because thats the mob that rarely gets killed)
cleric... well its sad to see shards go to waste.
