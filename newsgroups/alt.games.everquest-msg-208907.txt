To answer your question, I don't think there are any decent newbie armor
quests for Iksar Necromancers, however, you might be able to find some
generic necromancer gear that is easily obtained by going to
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/
and looking through the gear and quests (alas, the good quest searches are
only available to paid members. The good news is that paid membership is
relatively inexpensive for the amount of info he gives access too.)
