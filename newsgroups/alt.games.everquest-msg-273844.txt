I did read that, and found it very interesting.  I haven't run into any
zone in WoW that matches it for length and complexity, unfortunately.

Of the instances I've been in, Uldaman probably comes the closest.  It
certainly has some of the more memorable scenes--especially the final
battle, as Archaedas towers over you while bringing more and more of
the statues in the room to life.
