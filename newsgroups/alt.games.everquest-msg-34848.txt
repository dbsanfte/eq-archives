No.  You shouldn't. EQ has got to be the most obvious game you could possibly
be running... short of hitting the power switch you aren't going to get out of it
when your boss walks in.  

If you are in between projects at work, have you considered starting an 
interesting skunkworks project?  If you can get it far enough along to be
useful it might provide you way more fun at work than playing EQ.
