Wrong.  After release, this used to be the case.  You could take your level
15 wood-elf rogue and theoretically  pick 100K plat off of the same orc
pawn inside Crushbone...as long as you could put up with doing it 2 or 3
coppers
at a time.  Then you could kill him, and he'd have 1 silver, or a few
coppers.

Now, and this is verifiable fact, you can only pickpocket the loot that is
already
generated when the mob spawns.  The folks that run ShowEQ can testify to
this, as I've seen a level 20 ranger run around WC and find every bear with
a
HQ pelt and every wisp carrying a GL.  The critters that hold money spawn
with a certain amount, and you can ONLY pick down to 1 of each coin.

Orc pawn? Pick to your heart's content...you'll be lucky to get a scalp and
    8 coppers...kill him and receive 1 copper.

Orc centurion? Pick to your heart's content...you'll end up with a few
silver,
    a few copper, and maybe an item if he carries one...kill him and receive
    1 silver 1 copper, or 1 copper.

Orc legionnaire? Pick to your heart's content...you'll maybe get an item,
    maybe a few gold (yeah, right :-)  ), some silver, and some
copper...kill
    him and receive 1 gold 1 silver 1 copper, or 1 silver 1 copper, or 1
    copper.

Ry`Gorr Elite? Pick to your heart's content...if you're lucky, you might get
    a gem or quest component...a couple of plat, a few gold, a few silver,
and
    a few copper...kill him and receive 1 platinum 1 gold 1 silver 1 copper,
or
    1 gold 1 silver 1 copper, or 1 silver 1 copper, or 1 copper.

I hope you see the pattern.

On the other side, it is entirely possible to NOT pick a critter tottally
clean
down to the "one of each coin is left" welfare line.  I'm ally with the
Freeport
militia and the paladins of N. FP, but every time I run by a guard near the
zone, I pickpocket. If I'm lucky enough to pull a plat, that's one less plat
for a guard-camper 3 days from now.  I didn't pick him clean, but on the
other hand, if you've ever spent a while killing DE guards and every single
one you find has 1 pp 1 gp 1 sp 1 cp, or some other version thereof, you
can tell a rogue has been around.  It's really fun with a SoW potion and
a level 60 rogue...run through Rathe Mountains after a patch and pick every
HG clean...hear the shouts "Somebody tell Gerry he owes us a bunch of
money...none of these giants have more than a plat on 'em :-)  ." No big
deal,
the folks hunting just kill the welfare giants and the next round spawns
with
normal-for-their-level loot.

PICKPOCKET LOOT COMES FROM THE SAME POOL AS THE
LOOT POOL FROM KILLING A MOB!!!

There's no other way to state it, and the only reason that folks hang on
to the idea that it isn't this way is that it WASN'T that way for almost 9
months
or so after release.  Of course, it wasn't a big deal...before Kunark came
out, if you saw a rogue in a single week, you were special.  The folks
playing
rogues WANTED to be rogues, not just another twink (and nobody twinked
a rogue...it was a dead-end class at the time, even though it was fun, and
if you didn't have a  network of friends, you couldn't get a group).  After
Evade was added to the mix, rogues became much more that a 20 second
DoT-mana sponge-corpse recovery.  When rogues got a decent >8 damage
piercer that wasn't from a boss-mob in Fear (heading up to fear
dual-weilding
Serrated Bone Dirks was as uber as  a rogue got, unless you had a
Crystalline
Spear from Vox), more people started playing 'em.  So Verant stealth nerfed
the separate loot pool.

As an aside, level a rogue up and take him through the Burning Rapier
quest...and pickpocket the Clockwork Oil Stout from the clockwork in
Sol A.  I've done it twice.

1) 1 pp, 4 gp, 2 gp, 1 gp, 9 sp, 3 sp, 1 sp, 2 cp, 1 cp, 1 COS
2) 3 pp, 2 pp, 1 pp, 2 gp, 1 gp, 5 cp, 2 cp, 1 cp, 1 COS

The BR quest was added after the stealth-nerf, or it'd have been fun to
pp away plat after plat after plat on that little bugger...until you aggro'd
him and his 16 companions, too :-).
