No boats. No translocators.

At any adventurer camp, tell the magus to transport you to Nedaria's
Landing. From there you can tell that magus to transport you to
Natimbi or Abysmal Sea (or back to the other adventurer camps).

In the Abysmal Sea, there is a magus in the central superstructure who
can transport you to Nedaria's or Natimbi.

The magus at the Natimbi adventurer's camp can teleport you back to
Nedaria's or the Abysmal Sea.

To get to Nedaria's Landing from Jaggedpine, you have two choices. The
easiest is to go into Blackburrow and use the teleport stone there and
arrive in Jaggedpine in the Brell Gnolls's cave (they default con
apprehensive to everyone). So it's a safe place.

The other is to go to Surefall Glade, enter the caves and use the
teleport stone there and arrive at the fort/town in Jaggedpine. Not
safe for dark races and I don't know for sure about "evil" classes
though probably not safe. Head south from the fort, keeping along the
western wall. Might want to keep near the base of the wall for the
entrance to the Brell Gnolls's cave is a small structure near the
base.

Go in and eventually find another fort with patrolling Anchorites of
Brell (gnolls). If you came in via the Blackburrow teleport, take the
only passage out and you should find the fort easily.

The Brell cave has merchants and a banker (south side of cave outside
of fort). If you are evil class/race and can't get your cheese at the
Jaggedpine fort, you can buy from the Brell. The banker is a nice
thing too. On the north side of the cave there is a small cave with
several rooms with cave basilisks and genitors that can provide nice
and fairly safe xp (at least through the 40's).

Go through the gate, head straight through (past the shallow pool),
past the Oracle, past/through the small pond of water, and run through
the passage to zone into Nedaria's Landing.

After zoning into Nedaria's, you will come out onto the upper level of
the zone. If you don't have levitate, the way down is in the north
side of the zone past a river and follow the slope to the lower level.
Follow the river (cross to the south side) to it's mouth, look south,
and there are the docks.

Note: The wolves and bears here are kos to all non-druid and
non-ranger classes. Griffawns (griffons?) are kos to everyone as are
the panthers? (in the south part of zone away from docks). Wolves path
near the docks so it is not really safe and the Wayfarer guards do NOT
help. AFAIK nothing paths onto the piers.
