Best wizard I ever grouped with was a gnome in Highpass. I'm watching him
burn and shield, just doing everything right except rooting runners. Mostly
he was managing his mana and timing perfectly to get a kill shot as the mob
ran for help.

So I /w and see he is really a gnome magician which explains the kill shot
vs root which magicians don't have. Apparently he didn't want a pet for some
reason, maybe the experience loss to the pet.

Still waiting to group with a smart wizard. I haven't been lucky enough to
group with one that can do anything but wave bye bye to mobs when they run
for help yet. I would imagine odds of finding a smart wizard under thirty
are pretty low because of the dilution factor.
