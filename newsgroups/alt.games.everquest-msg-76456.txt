I have an almost 18 druid. She's my primary, so I've gotten -her- twists and
turns down pretty good, I think, though I frequently do stupid things,
still. I decided to not go the other night because I wasn't feeling up to a
challenge at the time, but it's still in the back of my mind. I've heard the
exp is good there, as well as some of the drops. I bought levitate just so I
could try it out there. When I get to feeling more up to the challenge, I'll
waltz over there and give it a shot. Someone else said I should just go to
Unrest and be done with it, though. To tell the truth, that place doesn't
sound so great either.
