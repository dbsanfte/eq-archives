Certainly can't fault you for not giving it a fair try.  Personally, I
knew I was hooked in about 6 hours, but if you've given it six weeks
and it isn't ringing your bell, I agree that's a pretty good
indicator.

In fairness to EQ, it is designed and intended primarily as a grouping
game, so yes, grouping is the way to go.

If you lean towards wanting (or needing, due to time constraints) to
solo more, you might try one of the more soloable classes. Druids and
Necromancers both allow for relatively easy soloing. You'll have a lot
of down time, but at least you can play alone when you only have a
short time slot open.

Hell, that happens to everyone. That's the fun of LF :)

Assuming you're going to places like Allakhazam's
(http://everquest.allakhazam.com/), the key to dealing with the
information is to never read the comments posted by people. Most of
them are blowhards more interested in demonstrating their superior
knowledge than passing along useful information. Just read the basic
quest information, and ignore the noise.

>want it to.

Doesn't sound like it at all. You're stating specific problems and
experiences you're having. That's a reasoned post, not a rant. Believe
me, we see a fair amount of rants here, this ain't nothing :)

>Is it just me?  Do I just not "get it"?

Could be you. What character classes have you played, and to what
level?

Maybe the game just isn't for you. This is why multiple games can
exist in the same market space. Everyone has different tastes, nothing
wrong with that.
