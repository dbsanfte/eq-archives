There's a lot less people in the newbie areas. :-p

I think virtually everyone has pretty much decided its hard to justify
expending much more time in the stress test when everything will go
away in a few days anyways. Just people who believe they have a shot
at the full beta competition, some people seeing which talents work
better than others, some looking for the best way to level fastest in
the early going (getting onto the bleeding edge will be on top of
almost everyone's minds at release to avoid the crowding I am sure),
and some just running around looking at the sights now.
