Gawd, that one sucks, too. On a slightly related note, what burns me
worst in that genre of idiocy are higher people that see you soloing a
mob as a newbie while they're passing through, then walk up and kill
it. If you complain, they come back with "I was helping you, you
ungrateful n00b!". "Helping" me. Yeah. Nevermind the fact I was at
50%, the mob was at 25%, and I didn't freaking ask for help....
