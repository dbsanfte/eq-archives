If you want to enable all the models but have the same or better
performance as when you have none enabled, simply turn textures to low
in options. It sames a ton of memory/swap usage and is the largest
performance boost for me. With textures on low, I notice about zero
difference with no or all the models and social animations on and my
system is really not similar to either of yours: P2 400, tnt 16 meg
agp, was 384 meg ram and now 585. The additional ram did not seem to
make much diff though for me, probably because at this point I need at
least a geforce 2 64 meg to make much of a dent.

Textures to Low really does not make the game look much worse than
having them on High yet is a big performance increase. I had all
models and socials at 384 meg ram with my system and was ok.
