I can't say I've ever completely resisted her AE, but I have partially 
resisted it.  I am about 90% sure I have completely resisted it, but don't 
have access to my logs from this computer.

Nah, bad idea, you don't want some damage dealer getting aggro first and 
dying.

Very good idea.

Yep, Pally should pull, and if they do it right DA will shield 2 blasts of 
the AE.

The best healing in this situation is Pally group heals.  This is a purely 
offensive fight.  Every melee should use their best offensive discipline, 
casters need to chain nuke.  Clerics nuke, shammys nuke, druids nuke.  If 
you time it right it is possible to kill the Queen without getting hit by 
AE, but expect to get hit once.  If you die before OOM, you're not casting 
enough.  If you die after OOM, someone else isn't casting enough.

We much prefer to fight her in the hallway before King/Queen rooms.  We 
pull the King's guards to the hallway, kill them, rush the King room, kill 
him, then move back to the hallway, pull and kill Queen's guards, then 
prep for Queen.  Pulling her to the top of the ramp allows the force to 
hide around the corner and wait until the AE call comes from the Pally, 
then everyone steps around the corner and hits her with everything.
