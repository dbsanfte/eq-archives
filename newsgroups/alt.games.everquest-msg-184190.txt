Oh MY.  I didn't bother watching them when I went to see the clips of 
gameplay.  Now I've got to learn how to make videos on the computer so I 
can mock that ad. ;p  I'll wait till I'm having a bad day at work and 
then start asking customers "By the way, I'm making a short 
advertisement, and you're ugly/nerdy/plain looking.  Can I get a shot of 
you saying 'It's time to slay the dragon!'?"
