This is JUST a guess, but if ya can't find definitive info, try using a loom
instead of a sewing kit.  Just a hunch, and "woven" to me implies that
you're weaving it on a loom.  Unfortunately, I have no suggestions as for
whether you should try combineing silk, threads, or swatches in it.  Good
luck!

BTW changing my nick on here to "The other Chris," seems like theres a few
of us here!  ;)
