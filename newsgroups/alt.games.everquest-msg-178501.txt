Well, I don't need the plat.  Every mob I kill, either somebody else loots
the corpse, or it rots (i really mean *every* one).. it wastes pulling time
to start looting shit..!

Tattle.. what do they say?

The only skills im raising are S/H, and BS.. sometimes safe fall.  I'll
raise sense trap and disarm trap when im on a raid, with a spare comp... the
other skills; ID is useless, and so is disarm.   I won't be wasting any time
raising those

Theres something you can PP atm that easily sells for 6k+

No, the ranger tanks.

Me and her have fungis, full buffs, and DS to do a lot of damage.. necro
just uses pet, nukes and dots (and, altho I can't avater the twinks.. I CAN
avater his like level 25 pet.  That pet is fuckin sick,  avater+speed of
vallon, he damn kills as fast as me+ranger)

We FFA tank..  yesterday it was me and another rogue grouped.. before when
it was the ranger, she had REAL problems holding agro (omfg, more on this)..
if im on alone, the rogue tanks..

Id say my BSing is often limited to when a mob is in flee mode (and those
fuckin horses in DSP warp like mad when they flee), level 42 and 160 BS
skill - I don't think its lagging behind, at least, its not crippling me.

My defence skills are all more than maxed haha.. inc 5 red cons, go go goun
to tank em all!

Taunt:  WTF???  Ranger at 30 couldnt keep agro for shit from my 30-32
rogue....
She re-made the ranger on a diff account (so its diff acct to her cleric)..
at level 22, keeping agro from my 35 agro was NP.

Well ok, I did give her a better weapon...  BUT..  on a camp, the monk sat
nearby ready for mob-pop.

We were using our twinks to kill stuff and pass the time, accidently pulled
a quest mob (low level, but a gazillion HP), so I used the monk to beat it
down (then FD/memblur...)

200+ DPS monk, haste, vengence gear etc, I joined the fight at 90%..

From 90% to 10%, level 32 ranger kept agro off my monk THE ENTIRE FIGHT!
WTF is up with that?

Most 65 warriors have trouble keeping agro if I don't do my bit
(positioning, fd etc), last time I grouped with a guildie 65 paladin he had
trouble with agro too (he stunned on inc, but soon after lost agro to me)..
yet a THIRTIES ranger with shitty gear (in comparison...) kept agro the
whole time.

It was funny, but damn was it sad.  Somebody, please, explain that!
