Well you know... with a girlfriend like that you may need to update your
life insurance... you do have life insurance right? come into my office
friend, have I commented on what I nice tie that is?

As for the sales career, I'm happy as a computer geek and snowboard
instructor... believe it or not that seems to give me some kind of weird
balance =)

As for your girl... spiking your drink is.... ummm.... some expression of
love prehaps? Who knows, maybe the bar guys were taking overpour to a new
level and those 3 bevvies were 30 standard drinks?Maybe shes just trying to
get back at you for abandoning her to play eq.
