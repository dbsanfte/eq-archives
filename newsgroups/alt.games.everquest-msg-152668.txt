Gameplay has to come first of course. The importance of graphics
depends on the genre.

Sometimes, very good game play can be spoilt by poor graphics, more
often great graphics are pointless without good gameplay.

In this instance as with other FPP games, the low quality of EQ
graphics gave me motion sickness. So all the gameplay in the world
isn't going to help?

I ask you, would you choose to immerse yourself in a different world
that made you sick?

Of course, I was looking for the great gameplay, why else would I have
looked in the first place?

Perhaps one of the expansions holds the key for me.

Ah, now women, that's much more complex. 

But I think there are similes to draw..

The greatest graphics in the world aren't much use without a bit of
gameplay ;)
