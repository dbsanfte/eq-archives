Thanks all for your thoughts.  I didn't think it would be that obscure,
but I wanted to check.  Since DarkHorse has rerelease LWandC, it
really captured my interest.

It was just a thought.  I've got seven characters that I juggle around
now, so I probably will not make a new one.    I was just more or less
curious how many would get the reference.  I entirely forgot about
the Japanese players that would pick up on it.

As far as Quakinbuch goes, yeah, it might be against the naming policy,
but it probably questionable.  All that aside, it's a great name for a gnome.
