similar setup (without netbeui)... i actually have a bunch of machines
strewn throughout my house all on a 'home LAN' connected to the cable
modem, most of which are dynamically assigned IPs, but some are hard
set. i think both these machines have set IPs though.198.168.0.2 & .3
or something along those lines...... hard or dynamic, it doesn't seem
to make a difference with the pausing on my end. thank you for the
input, though.
