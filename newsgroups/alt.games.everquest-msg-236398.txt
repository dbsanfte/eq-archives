Omg, I'm so stupid. You're right! I was looking through the /help the other
day and I did notice the tinting one. I set it to on, thinking it was on
already. Then logged out and the patch happened. I thought it had something
to do with that, I guess I did it myself! Wow...I didn't have any idea that
you could change it to that!
And I've been playing EQ for over 2 years. .. I do also know that no one
that I play with knows either. A little known fact brought to light! Thank
you. =-)
