Ah, but you've ignored a very important point. The druid has already
indicated they have the time available to spare, by offering a port.
Now it's just a question of how much they want. I imagine they'll spend
more time arguing about the difference between 10 and 20pp, than it
would've taken to do the port in the first place.

If you ask for a port, offer what you want to pay for the port.
/auc Paying 20pp for a port to BB
/auc Looking for a port so CS - paying whatever it takes!

If you offer to port for 'donations' you have no right to complain that
the 'donations' aren't up to scratch in your opinion. You want 20pp for
a port? Ask for 20pp for a port. 

Ditto for the 'Make Offer' responses to auctions. I always 'offer' 5pp,
then ask them again how much they're asking for, since as they know how
much it's NOT worth, they must have some idea how much it IS worth. Why
bother auctioning if you won't accept ANY offer. You know what you will
accept, you know what you WON'T accept, so figure out where the line is
and ask for that. Duh.
