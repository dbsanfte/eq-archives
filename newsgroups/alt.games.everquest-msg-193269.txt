I wonder when someone will do the Linux model, and we'll have a free MMORPG?

Let's figure out what it would take.

1. Client.  We need a free 3D engine.  The Quake II engine is free, and
could handle dungeons.  I don't know how well it would do in large outdoor
areas.  Presumably, Id will release the Quake III engine someday, and that
can be made to work pretty well outdoors.

2. Server (software).  Basically, we need a real time MUD.  This is not
hard.

3. Server (hardware).  OK, now we are getting to the hard stuff.  It's going
to be hard to find someone willing to put up a cluster of 20 or so machines
to support a server the size of an EQ server, with 3000 players and a huge
item database.  We'd have to try a different approach.  I'll cover that
later.

4. Server (bandwidth).  Same problem as #3.  Most people just won't have the
bandwidth for a server.

5. Content.  There are plenty of people who could and would design dungeons
and towns and outdoor areas.  Same goes for story.  Model designers would be
harder to come by.

6. Organization.  This would be a problem.  You need to get a lot of people
working together on content, without everyone going off and forking the
project when one of their pet ideas is rejected.  Linux owes its success
primarly to Linus Torvalds' skill as a manager.

Assuming that a free-MMORPG version of Linus could be found...can #3 and #4
be overcome?  Perhaps.  The architecture would have to be distributed, so
that one world runs on serveral widely spread servers.  Each server would
run just one zone, and the zones would have to be designed so that there
generally won't be more than maybe 30 people in a given zone (the exact
limit for a given server would depend on the upload bandwidth of that server).

As much as possible would have to be offloaded to the clients, with careful
use of cryptography to prevent cheating.  E.g., instead of a central server
keeping the permanent character data, it would probably be stored on the
client, digitally signed to prevent tampering.  The only thing stored
centrally would be a checksum, so that when your character is uploaded to a
given zone server, the zone server can verify that you haven't loaded an old
version.
