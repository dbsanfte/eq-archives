They won't need multiple Clerics, per se. They will want multiple Priests 
for sure but a Shaman/Cleric combination will be better in many cases than a 
Cleric/Cleric combo. As was true in EQLive, in EQ2 damage avoidance is 
better than damage healing and the combination of the two working together 
is pretty compelling.
