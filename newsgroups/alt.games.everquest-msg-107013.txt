    What does the average druid specialize in, anyways? I can see arguments
for evocation, alteration, and even conjuration.

    Yes, please do this. I'd love to watch. Call me a sadist, but I have an
image in my head now: Treeanna Treehousetrash, in her leather bustier, at
swordpoint. Before her, a melee rages between five PCs and five mobs.

"Cast it, Treeanna. Cast it now, or die!"
"Noooo, the adds, what about the adds?"
"CAST IT AND TANK LIKE A CHAMP, BABY!"

    Treeanna casts CH, gets two mobs on her, crumples like the tin foil on
the original poster's hat.

"It's a good thing she can res herself now. Bwahahahaha!"

    How can a cleric do that when he doesn't get CHeal until 39? Oh, sorry,
that's a fact, and you were on a roll. I'd point out how there's more
healing to be done on the average raid than just to plate tanks, or even in
XP groups, but those are ugly facts, too.

    And just to make Jazz strive harder: a level 39 cleric could heal one of
our troll warriors for up to 7300 HPs when they're fully buffed and good to
go. Apparently the main troll for our main competition is up to 7600 HPs,
but I haven't seen that confirmed yet. All the ogres E-Bay'ed. :-/

    It seems that way sometimes, but it isn't true. I can't think of many
standard turnout raids we've had where 1/6th of our people or more had
clerics. Most of our druids that gave up on the class became melees. We also
have problems on things like AoW where we don't have enough small, fast
healers like druids in addition to our battery of clerics, so it's not like
we don't want them.

    Does anyone else see a parallel between clerics and other
nature-destroying vermin introduced into an ecosystem in the language here?
I like it. Clerics, the zebra mussels of EQ!

    James, zebra mussel in good standing.
