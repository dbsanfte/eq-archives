 Ok ill explain this "problem" im having...I wanted to help a guildmate out and
let him use a sword i have not been using a ACG...He gladly accepted...two days
later he offer to trade me my sent arms for his blood ember arms...i say no..he
continues to ask to swap for awhile..i agreed....now after about 2 weeks i ask
if we could trade back....he replys...i gave the sent arms away...!!!
what!!!!..hmm ok can i have the ACG back then? he offers to buy it..for
3kpp..pretty damn cheap since he just gave away the arms i wanted back..and now
it looks like i wont be getting the sword back as i wanted....I cant beleive my
own guildmate cheated me like this..how would to solve this problem?
