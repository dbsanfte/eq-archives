Yeah, and for now I can get my "fast paced combat action" fix from City 
of Heroes. That game is nothing if it's not frantic, frantic combat but 
it has zero depth.

Since I'm doing the 30-day trial I can only be on Morden Rasp.

Well, I think so, yeah. :D I've got a quest from my guildmaster telling 
me to collect some material to use with a mold of a helm he gave me. The 
only problem is I have absolutely no idea where to look for the stuff. 
He suggested Ro or the commonlands but I have yet to see a drop that is 
even remotely similar to what he said I needed. The only ingredient I 
remember at the moment is iron ore, which I know isn't a drop but I have 
no idea where or how to find that. So, basically, I think I have gotten 
the quest but I'm still trying to figure out how to figure out what to 
do with it. :D

Will do. Isn't there a way to chat across servers? I know there are 
cross-server channels, but can you do /tells across servers?
