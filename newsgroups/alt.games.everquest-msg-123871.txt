You lose one yellow of experience.   If you get 90 percent rezed, you only
lose a half a blue.  96, about a quarter blue, maybe a bit less.

This is level 60 experience though... it goes *so* much faster than 59 (or
even 54) that it's almost funny.   It goes up so fast that it's not really as
big of a deal as it sounds.
