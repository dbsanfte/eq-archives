Wow.  Sonny??? I've been playing EQ, since before Kunark and while I'm
younger than average in this group I'll be 31 this year and while you
may want to act like my mother, you aren't nearly clever enough.

Second, I'm playing everquest.  And while it takes 3 accounts to start
an LDoN, it certainly doesn't require 3 people to zone in.  and when I
say routine, I mean it happens every night on every server, and at
least once a week in guild/ally/ooc/bazaar chat I see,
"Mage/Necro/bst/shaman/Competent Duo, looking for 1/2 more to open
LDoN/Nest/Creator/Other 3 person required mission long enough to get
mission giver to give mission, can disband once mission is acquired"

Perhaps you need to enlarge your field of view, or your circle of
friends.  I've seen things happen in this game you wouldn't believe,
and soloing an LDoN doesn't even scratch the surface.
