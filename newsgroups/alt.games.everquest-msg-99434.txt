Apparently some people have better ISP's than others, and didn't
get the post to begin with.  I didn't trim the crossposting because
I wanted the warning out there.  I reacted almost with out thinking
when I saw the javascript in the post, hit follow up - typed a
new subject, and hit send.  I didn't consider 'til afterward that
some people's newsreaders wouldn't thread it right, which is why
I followed up my own post with an explanation.  Just because the
bomb might not have affected you or a few others in no way reduced
the need for a warning.
