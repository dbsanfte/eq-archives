Been hunting here the last 2 days and gained 3 levels. Excellent zone for XP but no loot. fighting in a small group with 2
beastlords and a SK and pulling 3 or 4 mobs at a time. Fast XP. Easily soloable if you take you time and fight near zone incase of 2
many adds. Very easy once you reach 30.

Another option is to get in a group pulling to the pillar in Netherbian liar. Great XP and better loot. Need a group because
impossible to single pull and more than likely will get 4 or 5 at a time. This same group killed as many as 9 at a time. Trogs can
be a problem though.
