    The information on corpses is tied to your character file. So, in
theory, it will last as long as your character file lasts. The graveyard
zone will be an instanced zone - you click on whatever zones you in there,
and only you go in. Others won't be able to access any bodies but their own.
Nor do they need to - if your corpse rotted, the res timer has expired.
