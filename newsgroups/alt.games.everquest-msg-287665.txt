Would it work though?  I think that it would work in the game if it
weren't for the whiners that would inevitably complain about the dps
that the wizard can do and how the other classes can't do it.  They
wouldn't pay attention to the fact that the wizard's dps is capped by
threat - they'd just look at the numbers that they can theoretically
put out (for all of 5 seconds until they get squished)

I think that most wouldn't be - well, most if you measure by volume of
complaints anyway.
