...While at the same time keeping qualified Americans out of work...

The topic of outsourcing is a frustrating subject for me because there
are many qualified people in my field of Software Quality Assurance
who have lost jobs due to outsourcing to India.  Many can't even get
in the proverbial door in Level 1 tech support because of the
outsourcing.  I have been very fortunate that the company I work for
do not have a policy of laying people off.  They will cut corners in
other areas to instead of letting people go.

I know that one day it will eventually balance out or at least come
close.  There will come a time where outsourcing to India will not be
a good option because their salary demands will eventually increase to
the point where it really won't be very cost effective to outsource. 
If companies outsource to China, the government will most likely want
to take more and more to dump more dollars into their Government and
Army.
