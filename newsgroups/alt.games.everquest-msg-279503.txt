Also, there used to be a cost involved in casting the cleric buffs, so it's 
habit to contribute for them now.

When I'm on my ranger, I cast a SoW if someone even stops in front of me. 
Saves time and I really don't want to start a conversation anyway. ;) If 
they donate, I'll take the money. Afterall, I wouldn't want to offend them, 
and cash is good. lol
