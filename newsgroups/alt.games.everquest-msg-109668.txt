Goodness, not only did Ben and I agree on something, he stated it a
lot more clearly.

I saw an argument recently to the effect that once humans gained the
ability to manipulate their environment, they no longer were subject
to its evolutionary pressures, and therefore ceased evolving.

Of course, there's always the possibility that we'll nuke ourselves
back to the stone age, thereby both releasing our control over the
environment and peppering it with nice, mutation-inducing radiation.

Hell, it seems to me they've slipped since the 1980s, when people in
general at least knew enough to stfu when in a movie theater.
