I currently am running a P3 900 with a Geoforce2 512MB ram.   I have no
problems until I go exploring Luclin and I get framerates that are so bad I
have to turn my clip almost all the way down.

I was wondering if anyone with a P3 has gotten smooth frame rates by
upgrading their video card alone without upgrading the CPU.  The reason I
ask is I have gone this route before with other games in the past to no
avail until I upgraded the CPU and motherboard.  However the technology was
much different five years ago.

I would like to be able to play the game the way it was intended at full
clip.  Its nice to be able to see that train of mobs before its right on
your arse.
