I found a relatively quick way to raise begging with my beastlord was to
make a hotbutton that kicks, stops attacking, begs, then starts attacking,
and use it when soloing or in groups if I want extra aggro when meleeing (
I'm not a taunting class ). That way I can avoid annoying things that don't
already hate me and are trying to kill me! ^_^

Obviously I still have yet to actually succeed in begging though while it's
levelling up on already aggroed mobs so I'm unsure about reward. I have
successfully used it a number of times now to help gain aggro though, and
that's really the main reason I started working on it.

Hope that's of some help anyway. Good luck!
