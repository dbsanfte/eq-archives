Dex does nothing for avoiding blows and is a completely useless stat
for an INT caster. Ignore it, it does nothing.

Get your Agility over 75 and ignore that as well. Agility has diminishing
returns above 75 and since you are a dress wearing paper armor caster
it doesn't make any difference what your AC is.

True.

Both are good choices. But the best choice for a necro I think is
the Iksar. For one very good reason: REGENERATION. Necros
have life-to-mana converting spells and Health regen for a necro
is mana regen. Hit points for a necro are mana points.

But if you don't want an Iksar then between the Erudite and Gnome
are minor stuff:

Erudite:
Paineel and the warrens are awesome starting places
but with the spire right outside in Toxx you can move anywhere
you like.
Low agility at 70, put 5 points into it.
Night blind. Not a big deal since you get spells that will fix it.

Gnome:
Steamfont is a poor newbie area although I have not leveled a
gnome in it since they added the newbie quest armors so it might
be ok.
