? And which class' skills, outside maybe a monk, *do* sound interesting?
(an_wizard01 says 'oooo I just got specialize: divination!....').

Actually, rogues get some of the best skills outside of feign death:
Backstab is tons o' fun and part of what makes them the masters of
damage; Hide and Sneak are mind-bogglingly useful; they get Evade (Hide
used during combat), which is also just incredibly useful; plus the
regular gamut of dual wield, double attack, riposte, parry, instill
doubt, etc etc. They also get several unique skills: picklocks, sense
and disarm traps, pickpocket (nothing like stealing a giant's head off
it's own shoulders...), apply poison, make poison. post 50 they get all
sorts of nifty discs and abilities like warriors and monks.

I don't know, what kind of play experience are you looking for?

Rogues deal massive damage. With top of the line equipment and well
played, no one else comes close to dealing as much sustained damage over
long periods of time with no need to rest.

That being the case, rogue's are as equipment dependent as warriors.
They are the most group-dependent class in the game. A rogue without
someone in the group to allow him to keep the target's back in view as
much as possible (whether that be a tank, or a pet, or someone using
fear) is just a poor ranger. But in a good group, rogues shine like few
other classes. You can never go wrong by adding a rogue to your group
(unless they are a rouge - like the one my SK grouped with in OT at
level 34: "man, I can't taunt these things off you", "yeah, I haven't
ever bothered to practice my evade")

As was already mentioned, rogues are excellent at CR and scouting, since
their hide/sneak combo allows them to be invis and ITU simultaneously.
Also, they can buy/sell and bank in openly hostile areas, which can be
nice.

Overall, I find them to be one of the most enjoyable classes I've
played. Just depends on what you're looking for, though, as to whether
you should "really invest time into a rogue".
