I'd go with the AC over those extra stats. 4 Stam is less than 35 health,
Wis and Mana are negligible for a Tank Hybrid, IMO and 4 STR, DEX, AGI don't
amount to a whole lot.
IF those stats were doubled or even the Stamina was then I'd maybe agree
with you.
...But, I would be upgrading Legs and Boots before looking at the rings.12
Stamina on the Crusty boots is nice but 10ac, for someone that is wearing a
Fungi and carrying a Windblade, is piss poor...For a class that can self
heal I would sell that Fungi and get some proper armour...but I guess it
depends how serious the player is over the character.
If it's only meant to be a mess around twink then I guess the fungi fits in
well.
