I think SOE should alter con colours based on whether you are in a
group or solo. Having creatures marked as group or solo in very
unrealistic and unnecessarily reduces the amount of content for a solo
player. If SOE upgrades the colour of group creatures to a soloable
player (but keeps them the same for a group) it would vastly increase
the number of quest and creatures available to a solo player. Plus it
would save SOE money, as they won't have to make solo or group
content.
