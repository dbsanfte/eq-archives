I was running through EC yesterday when I see the following shout

Foulmouth shouts: I need a heal at Orc1

A few moments later I see

Foulmouth shouts: Whats wrong with you fucking people.  Why won't anyone
give me a fucking heal?

Many shouts/ooc's later to watch language

Foulmouth shouts: What are you going to do about it f u c k e r s!

Ok I suppose it was going to happen sooner or later so I use the handy dandy
little report feature (and hope I did it right) So now what happens?  Will I
ever know if my report got to someone?  I meant to report the ten lines of
text that were in my chat bar-I scrolled up to do it.  Was that the right
way, or does it report the last ten lines of chat?

Never paid any attention before because believe it or not I have never had a
need to use it.   Guess I've been lucky.
