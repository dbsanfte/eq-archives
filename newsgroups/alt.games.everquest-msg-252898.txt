Dude, what kind of dumbass response is this?  It's a hypothetical!  We've
already *decided* the thing's worthless!  This is not up for debate.  If you
want to change the parameters of the hypothetical and debate that, go wild,
but be aware that that's *not* the issue we're discussing here.  Hey, maybe
42 threatened to kill my children if I didn't pay him $1000 for a worthless
pebble.  Do you still think that would be something a court would enforce?
We can change all the factors of the hypothetical we want, but be aware that
it no longer concerns this particular issue.

Again, the parameter of the hypothetical states that the pebble was
worthless.  He knew it.  I knew it.  The deal was a sham.  A court is not
going to enforce a sham contract.

Doesn't matter what I thought.  I just have to assert that the pebble was
token consideration for my $1000, and that the contract was not legally
sufficient.  We've already decided the thing's worthless.  I don't have to
offer any explanation of my motives for entering the agreement in the first
place.  No court will force me to pay him.

Don't get ahead of yourself.  It still hasn't been decided that Everquest
platinum is worth anything.  That's the whole point of this discussion.
