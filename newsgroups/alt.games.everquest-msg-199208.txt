The only way you're going to do this is in a grouping situation. If
you have 1hb or piercing up, you can slowly improve your 1hs by
off-handing your 1hs and main-handing your strong weapon.

On the plus side, dual wielding two 1hs weapons, you should max out in
2-3 levels.

As a warrior, as you advance in levels, dual wielding > all. You have
to get your 1h skills up or you will eventually obsolete yourself.
