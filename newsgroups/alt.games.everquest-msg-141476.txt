I was wondering if anyone had any good ways to sell everything that's
in a container other than click item, click sell, click item, click
sell, etc.  A long time ago, you used to be able to click the box and
then click sell.  Each time you clicked sell, an item within the box
would be sold.  I know that a lot of people didn't like that behavior
and it was changed so that you have to empty the box yourself first. 
I know it's weird, but I actually liked the original behavior.   I
collect a lot of newbie junk and want to be able to sell it quickly. 
So anyone have any tricks?
