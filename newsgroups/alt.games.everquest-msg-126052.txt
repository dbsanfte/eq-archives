Well, from my own experience... It seems your oldest 'effect' on you will be
removed first, not where your effect is.

For instance...  Cast a bunch of spells...  Keep track of the order.  Now
click off your first two spells, recast them...  Now, cancel magic on
yourself.  you will notice the first two shouldn't go, but the ones below it
drop.  It doesn't matter on placing, it matter of how old one of the spell
effects are.
