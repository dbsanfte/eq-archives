Well I was refering to the fast heals, whilst the rotation catches up.

Well you find out the hard way I guess.. I just know from experience the 2-5
spots on the agro list are more often then not occupied by damage dealers,
debuffers and clerics, not warriors

I can tell you, without a shadow of a doubt, as a long time monk, voidance
instantly makes the mob turn to somebody else (assuming others are there and
on the agro list) and when the disc ends, he turns back to you.

Think of DA..   your all alone and cast it, mob still tries to whack you but
your invulnerable.  Now think when your with others, and you cast DA.  The
mob goes and hits somebody else, at least for the period of invulnerability.

Im not sure you were raiding when this was changed (you werent in a guild
prior to LC right?) but it got changed because people were using DA tanks to
trivialise mobs..  if somebody was top of the agro list, and then DA'd, the
mob would still try to keep hitting them.

That got changed a looooong time ago though, like, Winter 2001?

He hits you when feigned.

Getting hit after standing back up isn't uncommon... blur isnt particularly
reliable at these levels afterall.

But getting hit when FD, while he cons INDIF.. well I know 2 mobs who ALWAYS
do it:  Vindi and AoW.

They can be FD'd when full health np..  its once they get to the raid and
take damage, that FD becomes useless against those 2 mobs
