It's impossible to say what your experience will be like.  If playing gives
you headaches, then not playing is a wise move.  Unfortunately, there's no way
to tell if new hardware is going to alleviate the headaches other than to just
try it and see.

Lag has improved, but then so has my 'net connection.  Framerate has massively
improved, along with my machine.  I still get bad lag and bad framerates
occasionally.

[Note: I tend to think of "lag" as being server or net problems that cause my
spells not to complete, etc, and framerate as the video slowness that crowds
or bad zone design can cause]

If I stand at the main bank in PoK during a MGB festival, it gets this bad.
Pretty much never other than that.

Depends so much on your hardware, resolution, display options, and what zones
you play in that this can't be done.  That won't stop me!  On newish hardware
(which your GF6600 certainly is), you'll get 40-120fps most of the time if
you keep resolution low, and don't enable the more expensive video
options.  You WILL find times it gets worse than that.

Single player games simply never have the sheer number of highly-detailed
models in view at the same time.
