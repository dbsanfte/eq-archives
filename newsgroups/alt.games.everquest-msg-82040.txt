Well, that certainly *is* an option, isn't it?  Your mistake is
in thinking it's the *only* option.


Since you seem to have the only Firewire to God today, and since
you have all the answers, answer this:


1) A conception occurs.  The embryo is in the two-cell stage.
If left alone, it will become twins.

Tell me, Oh One With All The Answers, is this single embyro one
or two "humans?"  


Do you argue that there are two different "humans" in 
one "human" body?

Do you argue that there is only one and that the other
"human" pops up later? Does that mean that "hummanness"
doesn't occur at conception?  Does that mean it's OK to kill
that part of the embryo which would become the second twin if
you do it *before* it becomes "human?"


2) A conception occurs and the embyro develops into twins
which do not separate.

a) The smaller twin involutes, and the only thing left at
birth is the foot, and that is attached to the larger twin.  
Is it "murder" to remove that third foot from the larger twin?

Is that foot a "human?"  Would it be "murder" to remove that
foot in utero if that would increase the probablity of healthy
development and birth of the twin that has a complete body?

b) The smaller twin involutes, and the only thing left at
birth is a torso and legs (the second twin has no upper chest
or head), attached to the body of the larger twin.

Is that torso a "human?"   Is is "murder" to "kill" that
torso? Would it be "murder" to "kill" that torso in utero
through surgery if that would make development and birth
healthier for the twin that has an upper chest and head?

c) The smaller twin involutes, and the only thing left at
birth is the lower part of the face and the rest of the body,
all attached to the larger twin.  In other words, the smaller
twin is complete in everything except a brain.

Is that brainless body a "human?"  Is it "murder" to "kill"
that body?  Would it be "murder" to "kill" that body in utero
by in utero surgery if that would increase the likelihood
of healthy birth for the twin that has a brain?


d) There is no twin.  The fetus develops without a brain -- in
other words it is just like the smaller of the conjoined twins
in case (c), except that it is not attached to a larger, complete
twin.

Is that brainless body a "human?"  Is is "murder" to "kill"
that fetus?

If you answer that it is murder to kill in case d, then it must
be murder to kill in case c.  If it is murder to kill in case
c then it must be murder to kill in case b.  If it is murder to
kill in case b, then it must be murder to kill in case a.  And no,
a fetal foot is not a human, neither is a fetal torso, neither is 
a brainless fetal body, and neither is a fetus at all.
