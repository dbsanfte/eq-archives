Hi There

Sounds if you have a graphics bug. Both my satchels the Original and the 
Quested Upgrade both had the same bag Icons.

As for the Quest it's travel around most of the Brotherhood camps 
collecting parts or notes to improve the bag then handing all the parts 
and your original bag to one of the Halflings at one of the camps and he 
makes the new one and hands it to you.

Satchel of Abu-Kar  Weight = 1.0  Slots = 8 Giant  25% weight reduction 
Lore No-Drop

Reinforced Satchel of Abu-Kar   Weight = 1.0 Slots = 10 Giant 50% weight 
reduction Lore No-Drop

It takes a bit of time as there are quite a few steps involved. But as 
you can see it is worth it.
