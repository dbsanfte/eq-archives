I don't agree :) It depends on the mobs. I can still solo certain blues
as a level 53 Shaman with my pet and slow without problems. A group with
a cleric, SK and shammy would have no problems at all in killing loads
of such blues with not much downtime and exp sharing just across three
people. If you're hunting in places where youc an steal a clarity off
a chanter, you're totally set anyway.
