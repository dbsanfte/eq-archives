Except perhaps on the FV server, JBoots are no drop, and the few
exploits that once let you transfer them around have been fixed.

On the other hand, you now are the proud owner of a nice niche
item that few druids have.  JBoots are insta cast.  This means you'll
never again have to face trying to channel SOW while a mob which
dispelled your SOW or got lucky and watched your SOW fade
beats on you.  Further (and more important) you'll be able to
avoid having most of your buffs dispelled by more powerful
dispelling mobs, simply by chain casting JBoots to keep refilling
your first buff slot as they keep dispelling it.  I do the same thing
with a Spyglass, but the vision distortion is a nuisance... on the
other hand, it does work indoors, which JBoots do not.
