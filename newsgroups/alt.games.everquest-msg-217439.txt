With all of the talk of EQ2 that has been going on around here of late, I
decided to pop over to the official EQ2 website.  It has been a couple
months since I've looked over information posted there.  I did, however,
come across something I think is new and hasn't been mentioned here.

In the FAQ:
Can I transfer my characters that I created in the original EverQuest to
EverQuest II?
Because of our extensively redesigned game engine, existing EverQuest
characters cannot be transferred to EverQuest II. However, EverQuest players
can tie their new character to their existing one through our heritage
system, carrying on their family name and receiving heirlooms linked to
their EverQuest experience.

I am pretty sure that before SOE had stated that there would be no way of
carrying over any kind of legacy from EQ to EQ2, though I suppose I could be
mistaken.  Let the speculation of what this heritage system might entail
begin.
