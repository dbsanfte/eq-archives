Last Friday a hand singed petition was sent to Verant , Sony, PcGamer ,
PcGames , GameSpot , Intel , and Gateway.
This petition was sent by myself and a few hundred local EverQuest players
and a few Sony stock holders.( Not the ones that only own 100 or so shares
but some big dogs including me)
This petition had a few different parts to it the main being that Verant is
pushing the game to fast and releasing expansions and patches without enough
testing.
Now the whole reason for sending to the Pc game magazine companies was
simple. They rates this game very high before it went out and never reviewed
it after.
Intel and Gateway were informed of many problems that could give their
hardware a bad name.

Didn't take long a few hours and I had a live phone call from Sony wanting
to know what it was we wanted and what we would need to do to make a
difference.
To make a long story short we are sending copies of each poll / petition to
them to give them a better idea of the big picture.
The more that answer this truthfully the better results we may get.
I we fully know and understand that there will be small bugs and that
support for every type of system can't be done all at once. There will
always be someone who can't play for one reason or another but when you
start getting 5% to 20% that cant play after a patch that's not right.
Tech support was the other main problem we pointed out. When there is a bad
patch and everyone starts calling they make it short by saying update your
drivers it's not our problem its yours. This will need to stop and if there
is a large problem let us know right a way.
As most of you will agree we are very loyal to EverQuest and most will not
switch to another game but we need the game fixed.
Here is the link to our poll / petition
