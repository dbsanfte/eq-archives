First, cleric's symbols cost plat and any group that really needs a cleric
is having the cleric symbol at least their puller, MT, and chanter.  Last
time I checked, it cost my cleric 13 plat a pop to cast symbol.  Most groups
don't really reimburse the cleric for casting symbol.  The cleric thus ends
up basically eating it out of her/his share of the loot.  Do bards need any
expensive component to sing their songs?

Second, unlike the chanter, the cleric doesn't really get major bucks from
doing the trade skills.  They can imbue stuff, but my recent discussions
with other clerics on my server (Tunare) have informed me that there's not
much of a market or profit margin in doing so.

Third, clerics cannot really solo anything ... unless you're playing the
much-unwanted Battle Cleric.  Sure, normal clerics can go after some greens,
but not even all greens.  And when they do, they don't get any experience
for doing so.
