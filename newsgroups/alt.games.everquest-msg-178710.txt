Since you have a melee, I'd suggest a magic using class to help out.
It's tough to 2-box two melees, especially should you ever group and a
caster gets aggo.  It's a good idea to let group members know if you
are 2-boxing.  

Since you already have a class that can SoW, I'd suggest one of the
three following classes.  
1) Cleric would be a good choice as ranger heals are weak and it's
nice to eventually have an exp rez right away.  A cleric would also
give you something else to fear kite besides animals.  You may have to
decide who gets the WIS items, but at least the armor is different.
2) Magician would be a good choice as they have a pet to help beat on
the mobs.  The magician could summon weightless bags, and arrows or
bandages as needed instead of having to go to town for supplies.  The
magician also can summon focus items to help your ranger's spells.
You'd only have to decide which toon gets the drop when it is an
all/all item with INT and WIS.  
3) Shaman would be a good choice.  Not only does the shaman have
better heals than a ranger, a shaman could slow the mobs when you
melee.  The shaman also has a pet to help beat on mobs.  Shaman can
buff your STR and STA, something a lot of rangers are low on, as well
as your other stats such as DEX.  Shaman use the same armor type and
WIS gear as rangers, so I'd personally prefer a class that uses at
least a different armor type.  

The second character will be yours though.  Choose a class you would
like to play.  A druid, necro, or wizard would work fine too, but you
may dislike druids or not want to deal with the faction issues of
necromancers.  It's going to be a personal choice.
