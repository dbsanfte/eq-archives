Any mob with See Invisible can see a rogue sneak/hide.  This is not
level dependent, as a level 1 warrior with See Invis cast upon him
can see a sneak/hiding level 60 rogue.  Mobs with the spell can, too,
and it's not level dependent.

Some mobs spawn seeing invis, and again, it's not level dependent.
Any dragon or god sees invis as well as sneak/hide.  Even the lowly
royal guard in Crushbone (as well as Emporer Crush and D'Vinn)
spawns able to  see a hiding level 60 rogue.  He won't attack, but
he still sees.

Sneak is special, just ask any monk.  Monks can sneak but not
hide.  If you can stay behind a critter of ANY level, you can sneak
and not get caught.  Any monk or rogue or even halfling (who else
gets sneak?) can sneak behind Trakanon and recover some corpses,
as long as they can stay BEHIND him.  You don't even have to
hide...just hope they don't turn around...
