Odd how copying and pasting the subject line back in makes me a lying prick.

Ok, ass jack, here's a clue for you.  I was quite content to go about my
life not even realizing this thread was still going on, since I had it
ignored.  Then you come and change the subject line, and *bap* it's back on
my radar screen.  That's why people don't change subject lines, especially
in flame wars.  So, considering you're bitching that we're keeping this
going, how do you justify changing the subject line to bypass the ignore
lists?  Maybe you want this to keep going?

To add to all that, you jump out and immediately proclaim me to be a racist.
I hate people who play the race card.  It means they don't actually have any
intellectual arguments, so they attack with the first convienant "weapon."
You say I'm a racist?  Fine, it really doesn't matter to me.  Those who
actually deal with me know whether or not that's true, and everyone else
probably doesn't give a crap.

If you want to continue this, then take it to e-mail, so the rest of these
people don't have to see it.

Oy, and he's a top-poster, as well.  Somehow I should have known.
