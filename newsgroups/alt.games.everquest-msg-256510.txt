Thats exactly right.  As MT, I'm setting the target, the rest of the 
group is supposed to adapt to me, including the mezzer.  Now if the 
mezzer is having trouble controlling a certain mob or type of mob, he 
can request a switch:

"Bobthebuilder is unmezzable, SWITCH" would be a good message of an 
emergency type.

Or "Spongebob is unmezable, OFFTANK", if the mob in question is 
relatively wimpy but still bothersome.

Or he could say in group or in direct tell to MT something like "those 
Roadrunner mobs are hard to mez, can you kill them first?"

I've even seen instances where the enchanter picks the "Kill this next" 
target, which makes since if he's putting short term debuffs on or is 
just watching which mez is about to run out next.

None of the above communication was going on.  By Default, my assumption 
is that the MT picks the target on incoming, and picks each subsequent 
target, and my strong preference is to never see any mezz break message 
from anyone -but- the MT.

In my case, there's sometimes a several second break between killing one 
target and starting on the next; I'll announce target, but wait for my 
stun to come up again so I can stun before breaking mez.  In raids I had 
this idea drilled into my head, and in fact a couple different guild's I 
was in with my cleric arranged similar stunts with me, where they'd pull 
in a mob and then solo it with my healing support, never calling for 
assist at all, to see who in the raid would break discipline by 
attacking without the assist message.

MT's biggest crime is switching targets without both good reason and 
very audible warning.  Everyone else's biggest crime is breaking mez.

"Pick and Stick" is a good way to say that; I'm on THIS mob, and I'll 
come off it when its dead, not before (unless there's a good reason for 
an exception"

Doesn't help the situation, either, that there was a bard in the group 
who was willing to chain mez a caster mob in order to prevent casting 
during a fight; thats a good trick, although one thats very annoying to 
pet classes, but it means you may see half a dozen Grage broke mez 
messages from me on some kills, each one hitting me subliminally as a 
slap in the face; did I do something wrong?  Oh, no, bard's using one of 
his party tricks again.
