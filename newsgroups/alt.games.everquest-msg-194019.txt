I'm interested, mind you, but I'd like some reasoning or something... and I wanted
to make it clear that what you did say was already covered in my post.

Actually its possible that you did mean VoV would be better than VCoC, owing to the
stat boosts... but I wanted to know why.

Since it turns out  you are saying VCoC is better than VoV then you are saying the
reverse of what it looked like you were saying, which is that haste is better than
those stats.

Is haste always better than all stats, in all cases?  That would make the decision
making process pretty easy; if its not "some cases you want the stats, some you want
the haste" but rather "best possible haste, only then consider the stats" then its
not situational at all.
