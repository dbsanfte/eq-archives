I'm looking for a 2nd account and am wondering if anybody has one they no 
longer want.  I currently play a 70 enchanter and was 2 boxing for a while 
with my brothers beastlord but now he is back to playing full time so I've 
only got my 1 account again.  I'd love to get my own 2nd account and the 
thought of buying all the expansions again and starting from lvl 1 doesn't 
appeal to me.  Characters don't have to be 'uber' or anything but just 
something I can take over and progress on.  I know many people have quit EQ so 
there has to be accounts laying around nobody wants anymore.  My email is 
chaugen@abe.midco.net and my ICQ # is 5920325 if someone would like to contact 
me.
