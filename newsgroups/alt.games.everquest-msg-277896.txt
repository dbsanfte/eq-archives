I've been getting this as well and also scenery appearing 
and disappearing... Very annoying especially in zones like 
LFay, where trees are there then gone then there again. I 
log out in these situations, restart my system and all is 
well. I suspect a memory leak (once again, sigh) as in my 
case it only seems to happen if I've been logged in for 
quite a while.
