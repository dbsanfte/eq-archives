At high levels, if you want to tank 'hard' stuff, you'll need a Paladin 
/ Shadow Knight / Warrior.  Yes, I've watched mages pet tank in RSS, and 
WoS, but those mages were geared several expansions beyond those zones.

Likewise, rangers and beastlords can tank hard stuff, but in gear an 
expansion or two beyond what they're fighting.

If you decide never to tank anything, then go for a trio which can kite 
anything which doesn't summon.  Ranger, Necro, Mage would put out some 
pretty fierce DPS.  Can kite with two of the three, and DPS with the 
other two.  Choice of kiter depending on the mob.  Ranger can WS tank 
stuff in the event of problems.  Ranger can heal, necro can slow undead, 
can tank some stuff with pets in the lower levels, track is useful. 
There is still no heal aggro from healing pets, and ranger bow aggro is 
low DPS so if you find a mob you can pet tank, then it's pretty safe. 
Ranger and necro can both single pull in different situations, and with 
CoTH you can technically single pull anything with enough range involved.

If you want to tank stuff, you'll need slows, heals and a tank.  Shadow 
Knight, Shaman and Mage is a pretty good trio.  Can single pull anything 
in the game, Knight self heals help and mage DPS is going to be useful. 
  Paladin can replace the SK for more self healing but slightly less 
utility and lower DPS.  Warrior means you get more DPS, can tank harder 
stuff, but have to single pull using CoTH.  Cleric, Warrior Mage means 
you can pacify pull some stuff, but need the Warrior to use a slow-stick 
to slow stuff, although Warriors and Clerics can handle more unslowed 
stuff than other classes.

Druid, SK/Pal, Mage is a nice combo as well, with the druid being able 
to kite, heal, single pull etc. but again you need some way of slowing 
stuff.

Beastlord, Tank, Mage is very high DPS.  Beastlord's bring a lot of 
buffs and debuffs and some light heals, a tank with self heals is useful 
in this combo and beastlords don't take a lot of running if you run them 
like shaman with 100dps pets.

I run a Shaman and Warrior and the only thing I miss is DPS and pulling 
utility.  However, when you gear the warrior for it, you can handle a 
few mobs at once and Shaman excel in those situations (HoT's draw little 
aggro).  Shaman, Warrior and Mage would make a brutal combination, 
allowing single pulling (with CoTH, and patience), putting out a lot of 
DPS, and having plenty of utility.  I didn't push that one first because 
you already have a shaman main.  The problem with a BL in place of 
Shaman is the lack of full heals.
