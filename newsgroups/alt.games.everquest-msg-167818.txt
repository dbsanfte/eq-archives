Sounds like you blur mobs after mezzes in a group situation. Hard to tell,
but if so why bother? Just tell the tank that he has to taunt mobs 1st
before breaking mez. If you dont have a taunter or s/he's just shit at it
root em.

Sounds like your wasting an awful lot of mana that could be better used on
other things.
