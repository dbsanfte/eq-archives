Hi everyone ...    just wondering if anyone who knows a bit more about home
networking might be able to help explain if my router might be the cause of
all the disconnects I get and if there might be a solution.

I'm using windows XP and should have all the latest drivers.  I didn't
notice any problems after upgrading to XP a few months back and shortly
thereafter I also got a Linksys Router with 4-Port Switch that I installed.
Since that time, I seem to get punted out of EQ - not all the time but way
more than  I used to.  Seems to be at least once a session and usually
multiple times.

Any ideas?  Any one have similar experiences?

Thanks in advance for any and all help :)

Wylbur
