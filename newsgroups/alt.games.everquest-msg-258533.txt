They are simply enhanced versions of the crappy aa we already have.
The earlier version of Efficiency of the Hunter was so poor it took
long term parses to see any dps increase whatsoever and all the
earlier version of Guardian of the Glade (which had nearly identical
text) did was increase attack rating (there is no "increased attack
speed" even though it claimed it and I doubt the new one has it
either) for an insignificant dps boost on a timer delay.

This is a piss poor list of aa for rangers as we continue to sink to
the very bottom of class desirability, if we haven't already been
there for some time. Hell, this tracking bonus just helps us catch
back up to bards and druids....
