Well, Brat, you must admit that the fact that Matt, instead of owning up
to a faux-pas and apologizing, ran crying to daddy to sort the matter
out with all the people he managed to insult in the NG, does not
contribute a lot towards us changing our opinion of him (of which he can
blame nobody but himself). That he's young and hot-headed, you hardly
needed to tell us. That we have to take abuse and name-calling sitting
down, is a different matter.

It's not your position to come here and tell us to "knock it off". He
can either just own up, shrug it off, and demonstrate that he can be a
positive, clueful contributor (as happened with BONDA170 after he called
all of us "poons"), or he can limit himself to lurking and use this NG
as the tremendous source of information it is. What he cannot expect is
to insult people left, right and center with no response, either in
deference to his youth or out of fear of his own personal pit-bull.

It's a valuable Usenet lesson for him to learn: Those who want to dish
it out, must be able to take it. You are doing him no favours by trying
to draw fire. If he's so personally affected by all the negativity his
posts are generating, he should simply filter out the thread, and just
let it die naturally, while rebuilding his karma by being polite and
informative in other threads (as I have in fact seen him try to do).
There is nothing demeaning about that, it has happened to most of us in
the history of this newsgroup, myself included.
