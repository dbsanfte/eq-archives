Did the scammer even bother to verify the info the scum sell hasn't
been nerfed by Sony?  The easy money was nerfed long ago when Sony
changed the buy price of items you make with enchanted Velium so you
end up less than what you'd pay for the materials.  They also killed
the banker that was giving 1p for each 1g you gave.  Some mobs had
their XP tweaked to be more in line with the levels.

I'm willing to bet that 99% of the info he's selling is useless
anyway.
