what race is your char who cannot see.  I have noticed myself that I cannot
see like I should be able to with equipment.  effectively my equipment has
no effect on my ability to see, even though I know it should.  like using a
firedance ball that is suppose to shed light, or the gnome skin mask my
human warrior has, or  the 10 AC 9 wis shield my human cleric has which use
to shed light.

Even if you weren't in an area to shed light because it seemed some places
didn't show light as much as others, you would still have your char light up
to indicate the amount of light.  Didn't seem to work.

Ultravision decidedly did work though, and helped hugely for the human blind
cleric who is suppose to have a light source.

Think I even bothered to cast the light spell the cleric has, to no effect.

wondering if this is the T & L someone mentioned on the video card....
