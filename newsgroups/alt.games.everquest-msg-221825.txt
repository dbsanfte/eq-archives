Just because we *can* do something doesn't mean we're good at it.  Leather 
and chain classes get hit harder and more often than the plate classes, 
which eats up healer mana and means slower kills in the long run (unless 
you come across a healer with a boatload of mana regen and can keep up with 
it).  And like someone else pointed out, my DPS is about 3x higher when I'm 
using my bow and not tanking.

LDON is all about the fast kills.  Having to wait to engage something for a 
tick or two while the warrior builds up enough aggro that they might not 
lose it when slow gets cast takes up time.  In a lot of LDON groups, the 
mobs will be dead in 30-45 seconds, an additional 12 seconds is a lot of 
time.

Maybe when I finish off my defensive AAs I'll think about it.  As it stands 
the only time I tank is when the real tank dies.  Thus far I've tanked Laef 
Windfall and a kriger or two unslowed (at least until the slow landed on 
the kriger, Laef never got a slow), along with too many slowed krigers to 
count.  But the cleric is *always* very low on mana when the fight is 
finished.
