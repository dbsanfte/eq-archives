No, you start off apprehensive to the Coldain.  You start KOS to CoV
and the Giants.

A fast way to raise CoV is to get in a group hunting in Kael.  I've
been in two arena groups.  First one, in about 4 hours, took me to
dubious, about halfway to indifferent.  Second one, which also lasted
about 4 hours, got me to amiable.

Note that different things give different amounts of faction.  For
example, the Kael wolves in GD give +1 to CoV.  The various giants in
GD give +5 to CoV.  I don't know what the giants in and around the
arena in Kael give, but I think it is way more than +5.
