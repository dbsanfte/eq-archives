OK. Its IP... but not *protected* IP.

Amend to "The idea of plat" isn't *protected* IP. I can freely copy
the idea of plat into another work. This isnt really salient to the
discussion.

And:

Append "the implementation [source code] of plat" is IP. But nobody is
violating that.

And:

Append "virtual plat coins" aren't *protected* IP. The database they
reside in is IP and protected, but individual numerical values aren't
protected. A single number representing my plat: 3,521 cannot be
protected. Selling plat involves me changing that number. Something I
pay a monthly subscription for the priviledge to do.

You are suggesting that I cannot change that number as i see fit,
*within the scope of IP rights* for whatever reason I want (including
cash compensation)... see below for another analagy.

Suppose you are an author, and you own a bookstore filled with your
books. (An analagy for EQ servers filled with their plat, note that
for the sake of argument I gave you that 'plat' is protected by using
books for my example). Now I pay you a monthly fee for access to a
pile of books allocated to me (I don't own them, and i can't take them
out of the store.) 

But I can read them in the store, i can admire them, and I have the
priviledge to move the books in my pile to other piles assigned to
your other customers.

Now someone says to me they'll give me 50 bucks to put some of the
books in my pile into your pile.

I disagree that my actions could possibly be argued as a violating the
IP attached to the books.And this is with *books* something we all
agree has undisputed protected IP.

Now if you abstract those books into little identical grains of sand
picked up on a beach, it doesn't make a whit of difference. And this
is a more accurate represenation of coins of plat.

Poor choice of examples.
A Shord sword of the Ykesha in particular involves a trademark
(Ykesha). So its protected.

The IP for the 'idea' of 'a rusty longsword' on the other hand isn't
protected.

The IP for the source code of a 'a rusty longsword' is protected, as
is the IP for the source code that handles plat.

But nobody is violating *that*.
