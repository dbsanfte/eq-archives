I was just thinking it would be nice to be able to make lower level items of 
all classes. I'd like to make a lot of the lower level AppIII spells for my 
character instead of buying them.

I did know about the main component being vital but I thought that seeing as 
I was creating a shaped item, it would be just as simple to use a shaped 
primary component. I didnt realise creating a shaped item out of a shaped 
primary woukd be so difficult. I understand the logic behind this now. My 
succesful attempts were all done using regular (lvl3) primary components.

With this in mind, is there a particular class that would complement a 
craftsmen? I'm tempted to make another character simply to concentrate on 
crafting.

Thanks.
