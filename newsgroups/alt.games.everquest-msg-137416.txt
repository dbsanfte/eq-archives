Like your retarted top posting gives us a headache.
Anyway, if you think a MT switching targets to get a mob off a cleric is
bad, try a MT who (for example) pulls 2 mobs, x and y. Announces "incoming
x", you assist him and get x, so you mez Y. Mez then gets broken by the MT,
and 50/50 are on either mob. His reason for switching? Mob Z was just
slightly behind mob Y so he retargets just at the last moment.
I tell him that he should stop doing this, and get the reply "Stop
complaining, were doing OK"... this after being beaten to an inch of my life
by a mez-broken mob.
