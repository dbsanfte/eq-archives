The difference is that an Enchanter that can't mez high level mobs is 
practically useless in RSS (where glowing runes are actually obtainable 
by a single group regularly), whereas a warriro or knight that doesn't 
have the "best" weapon is still quite effective in RSS.

Hardly.  As a shaman, 3 of my level 70 spells are group versions of 
single target buffs.  Others are an AoE slow, a much better heal over 
time, and a poison DoT.  So, that's half of my level 70 spells that are 
group buffs.  I'd wager that for other buffing classes, the ratio is 
similar.

We raid 4 nights a week, and it takes forever to get all the casters 
equipped with level 70 spells.  The level 69 ones were easier to obtain.  
The mobs that drop level 70 runes are contested, we are lucky, on 
average, to get 2 level 70 runes per night of raiding.  Sometimes we get 
a lot more, sometimes we can't get any.  With a raid force of 50ish 
players, if even just half of them are casters, that is 175 or so glowing 
runes required.

I have 2 of my level 70 spells, and all of my 69 spells.  Most of the 
very few people in the guild that have a significant number of level 70 
spells are the ones who play EQ for huge amounts of time, and live in 
RSS.
