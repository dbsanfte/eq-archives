  PC/home computer games used to be relatively cheap to make.  It only took
1-2 programmers and maybe a few artists to make a game, at most.  You just
cannot make games like that anymore and have the bigger, better graphics
that are expected.  When you are making a game that will only sell to maybe
50,000 at most, and you make it on a shoestring budget, you can afford to do
this.  But you cannot make a multi-million dollar game and have it sell to
only a handful of people.
