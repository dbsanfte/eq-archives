 That's not the part people argue on. Nobody argues the fact that if
you're less than 100 STA you will suffer adverse effects when your
stamina runs low. The point not all people can agree on is whether or
not there is any effect of running out of stamina when you're over 100.
Whether a slower swing or less chance of critical attacks, stuff like
that.
