If you use some time on computer games and online- or network-gaming,
we would like you to complete this survey. The more answers we receive
- the better for the research results.

It is a survey about the present and the future of professional
gaming. Cyber-athletes are possibly soon to be recognized as a new
breed of sport-stars in society and we would like to know more about
this evolving aspect of computer gaming.

The results are not held secret. The summarized results will be
published on Game-Research.com - an independent, free source of
research on the art, business and science of computer games - in
spring 2002.

Thanks in advance to all that are willing to give us five minutes of
their time to complete this survey - we'll be very grateful. Please
contribute to spread knowledge on the art, business and science of
computer games.


Sincerely,
