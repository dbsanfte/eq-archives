Thirded.  Nice to meet you Rajan.  Annie, here from, alt.games.everquest.  Nice
little newsgroup you got here.  Anyways... was our newsgroup added because of the
Everquest = EQ thingey?  For a second I thought he was talking about the lawsuit
brought by the mother of the guy the blew his brains as he sat in front of his
computer at the character select screen.  But I guess I'm wrong, then.  
   Move along people, nothing to see here.
