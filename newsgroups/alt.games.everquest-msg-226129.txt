I've been accepted into the EQ2 beta test. I've been away for a while
and now am eager to try it out, unfortunately there's no way I can
download it. I only have 128k isdn and it will take 9 1/2 hours to
download at max rate. My session times don't last that long and for
some reason they have put the client up on a server that does not
support resuming. I've sent a couple of emails to soe with no reply.

Cheers,
