He was rather blunt, but does bring up a good point. No, warriors are
not worthless solo at that level, but the OP will come to a point
where he will find soloing nearly impossible. He should play by
whatever means he desires and has most fun at, but he will get to a
point where he HAS to group to continue to progress. The sooner he
learns how to effectively group the better off he will be. If he
doesnt soon, when he hits that point where he cant solo, he will get
unfortunately frustrated then try to group, then get frustrated some
more because he discovers grouping and soloing require different
tactics and then wished he grouped before. No one here is telling him
what to do, just suggesting on how to maximize his enjoyment of the
game. Once he starts grouping and sees the benefits of it, I believe
he will enjoy the game more.
