as much as i don't want to, i have to agree with you here somewhat.

sometimes i just think screw it, and walk away.  when somebody has really
got under my skin though with ksing, I have been known to let them know that
as a monk, with FD, i could pull pretty much every mob in the zone, and then
test my FD skill....

I've never gone through with it (and to be honest I don't think i have it in
me to deliberately fuck a lot of people like that).. but a warning of what
they can expect if they keep ksing is often enough.
