    We have three guilds that kill Tunare, and I bet if they knew the strat
one or two more that could do it. Killing Tunare has got my 55 rogue a whole
bunch of Assassin's armour, so I like it.

    We have two guilds killing AoW, and one more that's zerging it as often
as possible in an attempt to bring it down and be uber. They're really bad
at it, too - pretty soon they're going to rename the command to /hideWraith.
The other guild in their alliance, Reviviscence, is just about to throw in
the towel and leave Wraith to delevel on their own. (That's the other
in-joke on our server - Wraith requires all members to be /role for stealth
reasons, but we think it's to hide all the level 59's.)

    That's Wraith on our server. Glad they're below the top two guilds (us
and Vis Maior), or there'd be major hassles. It's an unhealthy attitude.

    We kill whatever is up, period. We'll kill, say, Burrower before Dain,
but if Dain is the biggest thing up then Dain dies. A lot of people still
want dragonhide boots, GoDS, or dwarf slaying belts. As for NToV, there's a
four guild rotation there now. There's a fifth guild that wants in, and if
they start killing there it'll go FFA. But one of the guilds in the rotation
pretty much doesn't raid except for NToV (talk about your sunshine players,
huh?) and Vis Maior is thinking about dropping it entirely, too (they
idolize FoH and want to leave all Velious content behind like FoH did). So
it may yet survive. We happen to be logging on tonight to take our turn, as
a matter of fact - you should see the turnout we get! :-/

> The emporer and shei are still unkilled on Prexus

    Vis and ourselves are killing Blood. Emperor is disease slowable, so
Emperor will die - we need the bane weapons, though. But from the
information we've gathered, we feel confident we can do it. The other big
guild, Vis, has more keys and (we think) more weapons, but they always have
a harder time with conceptual leaps so it'll be interesting to see who gets
him first. Both ourselves and Vis kill Shei with ease now that we have solid
tactics - Wraith has tried Shei once, but since they try to zerg to win (and
Shei spawns a level 60 add every time someone dies) they died horribly. Time
for another Wraith joke! Have you heard about the new quest with the peridot
vendor in The Bazaar? Tell him "I'm a member of Wraith" and he gives you a
tiny coffin and takes a quarter blue of XP from you.

    Addendum - of course, the one time I take a nap when we kill Cursed, he
drops the Circlet of Smoke. With the focus patch the irony is increased -
the wizard that got the Circlet wants my Bone Clasped Girdle (with Increased
Damage III), and I want his belt.

    That's great - get everyone all the faction they need for the turn-in at
the same time as getting the head. And the Cloak isn't such a bad item,
especially now that it's a focus. So do any of your many monks NOT have a
hammer now? ;-)
