Hmmm....I wonder who does?  Retail software stores in the US don't
actually buy the software and resell it.  They basically sell shelf
space to the software producers.  (And you get better placement if you
pay more...the US retail software market is not a pretty thing when
you look at how it actually works).  I don't think the distributors
actually buy anything, either.
