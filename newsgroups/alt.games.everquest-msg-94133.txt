Nah, true idiots are quite belligerent about refusing to learn from
experience.  These bozos, or their inbred cousins, used to sit afk on
the bridge in EK waiting for Proon to be trained on them, now they've
found a new place to hang out.  No doubt if they play the game long
enough they'll make it to KC where they will fight at the zone-side
where nobody's sitting and be surprised into similarly intelligent
remarks when they get trained to death there.
