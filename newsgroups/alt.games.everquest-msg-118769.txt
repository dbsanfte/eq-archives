I really like an Shadowknight  and Bard combination.
Levels 1-10 you really shouldn't group because you will get less experience.
Once you hit about 10 then group and the bard will have healing, haste, str,
and movement song...from there it just gets better...the monk is a good
alternate for the SK but i like the damage the sk can take with the armor
and I think you will find it a fun combination.  Bards can go almost
anywhere with an agnostic religion and SK's get FD later on which is great
for pulling.
