I decided to make a gnome SK.  It's a gnome, it has to be fun. So I drop a
few twink items on him that were cluttering up my bank, and head out,
killing gnolls.

I have to say, I -like- the newbie changes.  I die, I pop back up at my bind
spot, gear intact.

Got him to level 4, then got crazy.  I gave him a pair of 6AC/65HP rings,
and a pair of 2AC/35HP earrings.  For those keeping count, that's +200HP
worth of gear.  On a level 4.

He became a Newbie Death Machine.  I'd wade into a whole camp of low-red
gnolls.  4 or 5 would jump him.  He'd beat them to death, one by one,
and wind up with one bubble of health.  Then move to the next group, beat
down one or two, die, come back with all his gear and full health, and start
the cycle again.  Got him to level 9 in an evening.

Great great fun!
