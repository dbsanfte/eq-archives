Unless they've changed something recently, the Ti4200 128MB card has a
slower GPU than the 64MB card, so you'll be moving backwards.  There
aren't a lot of games out there yet that actually see a significant
performance gain from using a 128MB card, anyway.  Most of them can't
fill up the 64MB as it stands.
