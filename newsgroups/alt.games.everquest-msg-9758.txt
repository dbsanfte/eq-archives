Hunt gnolls in blackburrow for the fangs.  Turn them in to the captain of
the guard.  He's on the balcony of the warriors guild in qeynos, just above
the arena.  At first the rewards are low but as you raise faction you will
get better rewards.  I think I was averaging about 3 gold worth for each
fang.
