It only makes sense to have 2 groups if there is going to be traffic for 
2 groups. If three months from now we get one post a month about EQ1, 
(or EQ2) then it makes no sense at all. Making a near permanent 2nd 
group, and getting all the relevent newsadmins to carry it, to bridge a 
6 month transition period would be stupid.

A wait-an-see approach is sensible.
