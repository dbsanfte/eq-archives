>>>SNIP<<<
>> Also a friend of mine wants to try it out as well. His bank only gives
him ATM cards and he doesn't have any credit cards. Have they done any
improvements on methods of payments (such as checking account deduction)??<<

Your friend will be able to use a check cashing card. My bank offers one,
basically it's a souped up ATM card, or as they like to call it, "an
electronic check." It has the MC logo on it, and when I use it, the money
comes out of my account in 3 - 5 days, just like I wrote a check.

Have your friend look into this. From what I hear, most banks offer this
service.
