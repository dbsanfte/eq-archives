Hello group,

I am trying to copy Everquest from one computer to another to have a second
box to run another account on, however, even after installing EQ Trilogy and
then copying my EQ directory to the EQ directory on the new computer, it
still wants to patch the whole thing, which really isn't an option on 56k.
I've tried running complete file checks, and even went to reinstall from my
Trilogy, SoL, etc, CD's, still doing the same thing.  If anyone can help,
I'd be thankful.
