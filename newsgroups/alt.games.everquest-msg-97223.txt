Actually, all names are submitted to a guide for approval/disapproval.
However, a busy guide will often just ignore the approval box, letting
it auto-approve without even looking at it.  And if no guide is on at
the time (not all that uncommon), then the name will auto-approve
(assuming nobody else has the name and that it isn't on the kill list
already).
