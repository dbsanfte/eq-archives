Right.  Because the "ignorant and unskilled" people aren't
the ones leading the work or doing the "skilled" work.   An
"ignorant and unskilled" carpenter doesn't get any better,
BTW, simply by standing next to a master craftsman.   He
gets better by actually doing his work.

Right.  Because the "totally green troops" aren't leading the
battle.   But a "totally green trooper" doesn't get any better
at aiming his rifle by being next to a skilled sharpshooter...

Not a whole lot of difference, if you're going to throw them
into battle against seasoned and veteran opponents.  All
the veteran knight can do is defeat his own opponent;  that
veteran knight on the other side is going to quickly dispatch
the squire anyway...

No disbelief required.   You're using a false assumption...

And there it is.  "Level" has nothing to do with "learning."
You CAN learn your abilities in combat with a higher-level.
Your casting skills will go up, your offense/defense skills
will go up, etc.   For lack of a better term, what will NOT
go up is your ability to lead, to act on your own against
higher-ability opponents, etc.  --- that's your level.  And
it won't because the higher-levels you're with are the ones
doing the work...
