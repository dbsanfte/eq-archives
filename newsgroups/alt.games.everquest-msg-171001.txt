Sure, in real life or fantasy literature, recovering from damage should take
time.  But EQ is a video game.  I don't have a better solution, but there
has to be something better than making people sit motionless.

When it comes to mana regeneration, there's really no excuse for it.  The
concept of mana is a fabrication, so there's no real life reason to force
people to sit.  I'd rather have weaker spells without the concept of mana.
It would take longer for a healer to heal a warrior, but both would be
actively engaged in an activity, not sitting motionless.
