Yes. And as Ben has pointed out, it's *not* wrong information if you are
in first person view. (Which is the only one I'm comfortable fighting in
at this time). The combat animation from first person is very wooden. I
did watch a human style Seer from Avalon fight in third person and there
was *some* more combat animation, but it still sucked compared to EQ in
that regard.
