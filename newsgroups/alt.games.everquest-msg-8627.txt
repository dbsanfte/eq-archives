This news really depressed me. I've read the series several times, watched
the show, played the text based game, etc.

I was playing in the Swamp of NH with my lvl 15 SK, thinking about how much
his books meant to me. Suddenly a lvl 52 Necro ran up to me and gave me a 2
handed Practice Sword (yes - the sweet one that drops in Dalnir) and rescued
my Iksar tail on 2 occasions.

It cheered me up immensely.

Verant folk - drop a Dolphin NPC in the game that gives Clarity for every 42
Fish Scales : )

/em is feeling old at 37
