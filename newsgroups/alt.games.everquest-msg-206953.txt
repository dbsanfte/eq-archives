    We only went inside the first time we did an Avatar. There's just too
much junk in there to move a raid in, and the pullers need the room to play
with stuff.

    We're really good about crossing islands we don't intend to clear. I
still like our zone-in method best - get a bard to run all those suits in a
circle while the raid runs along one wall and up into the tunnel. As long as
we don't group a recruit cleric with that bard, we're fine. (That was one
ugly fight the time we did that, BTW.)

    They get stuck in pathing, the same as the nameds on the islands
sometimes do. The named elementals seem to be the worst for that, and what
makes it even worse is the way you fix the problem. If the person the mob is
aggro on gets close to the stuck mob, at a certain point they come unstuck
and start to chase. For avatars, that's not a problem for me - they get
aggro on the pullers. But for the elementals, they somehow get aggro on the
camp. And it seems like every time that happens, it's me that they hate. So
I'll get a tell from pull team: "Delores, move up the ramp. Closer, closer.
RUN, RUN NOW!" And if I get lagged running down that ramp and don't get DA
off in time, I become dwarf pate.
