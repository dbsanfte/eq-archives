A friend of mine and I stopped playing for 6 months or so sometime after
Kunark came out. When we came back at the same time, I still had all my
chars, he didn't. He actually emailed tech support and they restored his
characters from backup for him, so he was happy (apparently all that data is
floating around on backup somewhere... last time they restored a server I
was on I got a character back I had deleted before Kunark came out.)
