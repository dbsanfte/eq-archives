Like at midnight when I'm off work, or at 2 am or other weird times.
My life changed and I'm not going to new server with a different time
zone, It might just change again. It would be kind of impossible to
dig up even two group buddies, let alone 4.

Yes, but as I say its going to be pretty impossible to find 4 other
people to enjoy that content with at around midnight nor do I want to
log on even trying to work around that limitation. I could see it now,
log on and try for two hours to find four people, then my EQ time is
pretty much up and I crash. The whole point in my playing a druid is
that I'm in control and can play no matter what cards I am dealt that
night, this would ruin that.

About the only time I'd have any chance of using the expansion would
be on Saturday or Sunday, but then I'm so burned out from my weird
work hours during the week that I feel more like vegging and going to
a movie/renting dvd's or something. During the week I'm sort of wired
for a couple hours right when I get off work.

Lately I've been playing Anarchy Online more at those times, it is
accelerated with solo instanced content. There is really no downtime
at all. I used to like EQ more, but AO is just fitting my lifestyle
more while EQ alienates me more.

If the expansion ends up the way it sounds in that interview, I just
can't see it being worth it for me.
