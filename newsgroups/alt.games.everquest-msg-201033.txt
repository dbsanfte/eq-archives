It means Multiple people contribute to the Quest.

Basically, the MQ requires 2 or more items. First person hands in one or
more items, second person hands in the rest. The second person is rewarded
with the quest item.

For the JBoots, person 1 hands in the drop from the AC (can't remember
what it is, sorry) and person 2 hands in the cash required and gets
the Jboots back.

Similarly, Thurg armor MQs have person 1 hand in the corroded armour
piece and person 2 hands in the gems. Person 2 ends up with the
quested armour.
