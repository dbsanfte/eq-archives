My first character was an Erudite.  I think you can imagine how well 
*that* went.  The only reason she survived so long was that I couldn't 
find my way out of the buildings.  I finally got down into some basement 
and drowned in a pool.  To this day I have no idea where the heck I 
ended up (probably because my SECOND was an erudite, too, and I managed 
to get out this time, took one look at Toxx, and /camped to make a new 
character. ;p
