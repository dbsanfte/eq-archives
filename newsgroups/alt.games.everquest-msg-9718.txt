The pickclaw warriors and raiders drop it pretty regularly. I sold several
high quality ores when I was cashing out last night.  If you have the cash
and can wander down to the two vendors in high keep who stand near guard
Bolton by the steps that head down to the guard room, you'll probably find a
bunch of it that players have sold to them on their way upstairs to the
bank.
