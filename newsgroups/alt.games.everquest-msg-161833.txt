I recently went there for basically the first time at 55, to finish up the
Concussion quest.  I went in first with my 10 Rogue, to find the Human
Skeleton, and then took my Wizard.  What I found interesting was the
factions.  There would be one mob that was indifferent or dubious (I forget
which...but it was safe) to my Dark Elf Wizard, and another, of the same
type, that was scowling.

Anyway, I did some /ooc'ing to find out if anyone was camping the jail area,
and would not mind if I came to do the quest.  A nice group of 58-60's that
was XPing in the hand room offered to help, came and got me, and escorted me
to the jail.  There was a Monk camping the jail, and he killed my quest mob
before he realized that it was the mob I needed, so the hand group told me
to wait with them while they camped the hand, and then they'd keep me safe
when the quest mob respawned.  The Monk said he'd avoid killing it next time
so I could do my turn in.  So, off to the hand room.

The hand room was interesting because everything that spawned there in the
couple of hours we were there was not hostile to me.  It looks like the hand
room is a perfectly safe place for an agnostic DE who hasn't done anything
to mess up KC factions can hang out.  Everything that the hand group pulled
to there was also either non-hostile, or did not see through invis (even
though the hand room appears to be safe, I stayed invis except when I'd
purposefully drop invis to con things).

I suggested early on to the XP group that I disband while waiting for the
quest mob, so as to not leach XP from them (they told me not to help on any
of the fights, so I would not get faction hits).  They told me to stay
grouped.  I got a couple blues of XP just sitting around waiting for the
quest mob. :-)
