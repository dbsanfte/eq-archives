Current events do not bear that out, Judy.

Israel HAS stopped it's campaigns a dozen times or more.  Israel has
bent over backwards to accomadate the PA almost to the point of
capitulation. 

It did no good.  The terrorism continued.  They ONLY time that
terrorism was abated is when the Israelis occuppied PA territory and
crushed the enemy with overwhelming force.

The terrorism WON'T step until ONE of three things occur.

1- Israel concedes and throws herself into the sea.

2- Israel totally demolishes the terrorist infrastructure and
completely dominates and controls the Palestinians.

3- The PA comes under real and responsible leadership who convinces
the Palestinians that the road to peace and stability IS peace and
stability.  Not terrorism.


1 will NEVER happen.

3 sounds nice and would be nice, but I don't see it.

2 is the most likely outcome, if the PA stays the course they are on..


The door to peace lies with the PA.  They have been cajoled,
encouraged and dragged to go thru it.  They refuse.

And their current situation is the result.
