     It was 5:22 am, and I was lacing up my shoes when the phone rang.  I was
instantly worried.   Lenny had just strolled out the door for work a five
minutes before.  A quick glance at caller ID confirmed it was him.  "What's up?"
I asked evenly into the receiver.  
   "Guess what?" he said, and paused briefly.  My mind raced.  You ran off the
road?  You got rear ended?  A deer leaped through the windshield and impaled
you, killing you, and this is your ghost calling home for one last good-bye?
"Microsoft just announced that they are coming out with a computer that does 2
_trillion_ operations a second.  Not two, you know, megs worth, but trillions!"

   I was able to breath again, and I kept my voice even.  "Ok, we can get it."

  He mumbled something about it being a gaming machine, and we would wait and
see.  We said our good-byes, and promised to see each other when we got home
from work.

   This is what life with a computer Enthusiast is like.  (Good thing I'm sorta
one too!)
