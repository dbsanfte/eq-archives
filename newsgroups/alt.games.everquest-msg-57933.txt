Its one of the reasons why I never played DAOC beyond the beta. You
are right though, the FV server is very much like playing on a DAOC
server was. The thing is, I don't play a massively multiplayer
roleplaying game to have the other players turned off. I kind of think
the entire point is knowing that they are around. 

I love the constant auctioning and talking on my regular server in
East Commons because it is far better than the alternative on the FV
server, which is total silence. I'll get out a single player RPG if I
want that.

Can't there be something in the middle? The extreme irony is that
anyone who WANTS to not hear auction, shout or ooc can turn them off
and always could.
