As someone who "screens" apps all the time, if I turned down everyone who
omitted some detail, well, I'd be in a guild of one.  People put their best
foot forward.  Those aren't "lies through omission", they are simply
omissions.  Perhaps he thought that Bob was(n't) a grudge-holding,
blacklist-keeping, unforgiving, and/or forgetful person, and as it was in
the past and he had no intention of doing it again, why bring it up. 
Perhaps he truly was an ass beyond belief.  There really isn't enough to go
on to decide one way or the other.  There was one way to find out, but that
opportunity came and went.

> When questioned about his identity, he lied again.

There was his lie, quickly (as far as I can tell from the recounting) owned
up to.  This, however, is mostly irrelevant, as your post, and my response,
concerned the "only reason he got in the guild".

Terminology is a funny thing, because here we rely on Bob's retelling. 
Perhaps he actually used the word "accident" and perhaps that was just a
paraphrased impression.  Or, as I find so often with younger people, simply
poor english.  You never hear a 15-year-old say "error in judgment".

Quit floundering, you little puke.  You sound like you have some personal
stake in besmirching the little fucktard's honor.

Damn, it almost hurt to write such a lame flame.  A little originality and a
thesaurus would do you good.
