    Screws up basic things: give them a stern warning of what they're doing
wrong, why it is wrong, and what they can do to correct the situation. If
they correct the problem, you win. If they semi-correct, remember not to
group with them again, but try and finish the mission as you can. If they're
so dysfunctional that they'll kill you if you keep them, but you'll be OK if
they're gone (wizard that likes to AoE mezzed mobs, for example), boot them.

    Breaks basic etiquette (long AFK, turbo-looter, etc.): if they're at
keyboard to be warned, give them a tell as a warning. Tell them exactly what
they're doing wrong, and how they can correct the situation. If they
continue to break etiquette, give them a second and final warning in
groupsay. Still stupid? Disband them. No reason to keep people around that
make others miserable at a recreation activity. There's other little things
you can do to counter-grief some morons, too. For example, did you realize
that if someone is on auto-follow, and is disbanded from the group, they
continue to auto-follow? I think Joe AFK will figure out what's expected of
him after the third time you explain to him that you pressed the wrong key,
sorry for the disband, I invited you back but you were AFK....

    That's actually a good thing, depending on who he's auto-following. That
way you don't need to wait for him to catch up when he gets back, he won't
get lost somewhere and slow you up with CR, etc. As long as the person isn't
going AFK for dinner and a movie, or to read War and Peace, that's good
practice.

    It amazes me how many people think those crates are the be-all and
end-all of EQ. They can do one of what, five things? Small health regen,
small mana regen, a 10 minute animation pet, nothing, spawn three adds. The
health and mana regen are so small as to be pointless, in my experience. So
really, if something happens that actually matters to the party, it's 50-50
as to it being good or bad. So if you're pressed on time, or in a fight, why
do it?

    Be fair, explain why you're doing what you're doing, always give that
one chance to correct stupidity. After that, it's every dwarf for himself!
