Remove the hordes of *anyone* of higher level you mean. If you want to 
imply the measure of "level-appropriate" should be made in a vacuum, then 
you should also remove items which would only be obtainable by grouping 
at that level. That's starting to get unreasonable imho.

Fair enough, but I'm not gonna split hairs with you here. The fact of the 
matter is that playing EQ in it's current state, it is very easy to have 
better gear than is granted using /testbuff without having any gifting or 
powerlevelling resources. Therefore, the /testbuff gear is by no means 
*too* good.
