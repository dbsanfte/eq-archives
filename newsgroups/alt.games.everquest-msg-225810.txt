Hhehehe, yes, well, it makes sense to me.  All I care about is getting
access to Tactics, which I hear makes for more fun that HoH.  Not that I
wouldn't love a Behe raid, but all the open-server ones I've joined so far
have failed.  I figure if I'm ever so insane as to reverse my MO and join
a guild that goes for elementals, we can deal with "fixing" my flags then.
