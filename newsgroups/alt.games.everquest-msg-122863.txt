    I love these, too. The HP bonus is nice, and it gets your Baking really
high (mine's 182 now).

    Two choices: Maiden's Eye (umbrous toilers) and Akheva (a centi _____ ).
Maiden's Eye is a train-filled nightmare where the aggro ranges are beyond
belief and a good number of mobs have Harm Touch. Stuff is blue to 60, so
this isn't an option for Jakiss. High-level wizards have been known to quad
the Toilers, but it's usually an exercise in de-levelling with the trains
and traps. Because of the random rare loot drops, this is one of the steps
in the fast levelling treadmill - with all that implies.

    Akheva is slightly tougher than Maiden's Eye. More spellcasting mobs,
not as many harm touchers, more traps. Takes a solid group at your level. If
the zone-in is camped, other camps are fairly deep in - be aware of that
when planning. To get to the Akheva zone, you need to go past a mix of
Umbrous Toilers, four-armed guys and robe-wraith mobs near the zone-in. Some
of my guildmates still die running this, as old trains tend to pile up
filled with level 55+ mobs that nuke and harm touch, and which have a mix of
live and undead mobs in them. Jakiss couldn't even get into the zone to ask
folks for the meat - he'd die incoming.

    James
