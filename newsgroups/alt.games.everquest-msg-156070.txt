Thats a tactic typically used when the majority of the guild is KOS to
dorfs.  Otherwise, they make for fine assistance on the regular waves

By the nexus scion,  west by the caves, centre from thurg (just to the right
of where the spearmen spawn)

20 people mid 50's to 60?  Rubbish.  You would simply be overwhelmed by the
mob numbers.

Also, the quest lasts several hours (can't rush it because the waves are
timed)

You wouldnt even have mana after the first wave completed, even with KEI you
can expect to be lom after each wave, only medding during the brief script
pauses

Yes Narandi is kitable.  Its highly recommended because if somebody trains
him to a zoneline, you poof the quest,  and train it near thurg and if
nobosy is ready, you will die.

Id say 1-2 people at thurg is a requirement not "probably help"
