How good can your faction with a group get?  I play on Rallos zek.  My
faction with the high pass guards, and the high hold guards is ally.
Is that as high as it can go?  Does that mean I can attack another
player in front of them and they will let me do it?  I have seen
players do this in other areas no magical attacks I mean weapon
attacks and the guards do nothing?  How high does your faction have to
be?

Thanks
