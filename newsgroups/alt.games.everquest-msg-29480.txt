True, but having a *mix* of abilities is often an overall advantage
despite each ability being technically "never as good" as the
ability of the class that has *only* that ability.

For example, I've spent the past few days (as a level 52 Paladin)
soloing the Chief room in Temple of Droga.  (I'm going to get
that Idol of the Thorned yet, dammit -- anyone want a backpack
full of RogKus' Stickers?)

The Chief room is the "boss" room of Droga.  It ain't easy,
even if everything in the room is technically "green" (although
the Chief just barely so, I've gotten exp from him).

As a Paladin, I have the melee power to kill the goblins, the
ability to chain-stun to keep the casters from wiping me out,
and the healing ability to make myself ready for the next
round.

I know that no 52 Warrior could hold that room
solo, the casters would do almost full damage on him
(they chain-nuke for a lot of damage, very annoying),
he couldn't stop runners, and he couldn't recover HP
fast enough to not be worn down over time by the respawns.

And I'm pretty sure that no 52 Cleric could do it either,
he couldn't generate enough damage output without going
OOM.

So while I can't tank *quite* as well as a Warrior, nor
heal as well as a Cleric, I can still kick more butt
than either in a lot of situations.

...or not.  Shamans and Druids are both "pure" casters, and
not hybrids at all.

You've been playing this game how long?

The hybrid classes are:  Paladins, Shadow Knights, Rangers,
and Bards (although the Bards are admittedly a special case).
The upcoming Luclin expansion will add Beastlords to that list.
