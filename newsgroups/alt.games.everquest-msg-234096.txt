So, Mage with charmed pet, FT9, MC3 - BL (12aa in about 30 minutes),
Druid with 200+aa, FT14, Cleric with 196aa, FT13, Wiz with only FT9
and 20ish AA and a <9k (w 9/mark/kitty buffs) Warrior with 80 AA -
I'd worry that a damage spike would take the tank down.  We've 
done him plenty of times, we understand keeping him out of ae range
of the casters (all have ERIV items).

Like I said, my normal group might 1 group him (and I thinkw we'll
end up trying sooner or later) but I think it would be a close fight.
