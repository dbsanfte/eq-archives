Hey, hang on a minute! Right after the last patch, weren't there a bunch
of people who posted here saying that they couldn't log in, or if they
did the performance sucked, etc.?  I seem to recall one of them saying
they had to download some test patch or other, or possibly delete a file
and reload. Not sure. You may want to do a giganews search of the day
after the patch or two and see. I know my alcohol soaked brain cell is
very unreliable for knowledge past what I had for a snack while playing
EQ an hour ago, (what did I have again?) but I'm positive there was
somehting like that.
