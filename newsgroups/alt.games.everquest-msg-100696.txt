  But it's not my JOB.  As a customer, it's only my responsibility to pay
the bill and let the company know where I'd like to see improvements, and
what areas are only of secondary or tertiary concern of mine.  I place CS
and game stability higher in priority than expansion.  Maybe for business
reasons it's not practical to Verant to take such a stance... I don't know.
What I know is that I don't like seeing the price for a service go up while
there isn't any indication that investments will be made in those areas that
I think of as most important.

  That doesn't mean I loathe Verant for making the decision to raise the
subscription price while apparently not attending my highest concerns.  They
gotta do what they gotta do... I don't have the facts and expertise to know
if they could invest more CS, or if they do in fact need to make this price
increase to remain profitable or stay in business... I doubt if anybody
participating in this discussion truly does.  I'm just saying that for my
extra $3/month, I would like to HOPE that some of it IS invested in
improving the CS infrastructure one way or another.

  Of course not.  Again, I'm just stating what *I* view as a priority, and
am not saying I know the secret formula to making everyone happy while
making a lot of money is.  If what I'd like to see doesn't mesh with what
Verant can do, or what the majority of what other people want... poo for me.
:P  It won't make me happy, but I'm not screaming bloody murder either.

  This is true, to an extent.  What I meant by "the only thing that's
changing..." was with regards to the service that we are receiving, not
their behind the scenes cost of doing business.  It's possible that service
will improve or decline as a result of the change.  I'm making the
assumption that Verant isn't going to make a big commitment to improve
customer service, communication with their customers, or their quality
control prodecures, because they haven't made any indication that they will
be doing so.  I would think that if they had such plans, they'd announce
them along with their price hike to help smooth ruffled feathers.  But they
haven't really said what the money will go towards, other than "the
increased costs of running EverQuest".  That SOUNDS to me like they're doing
it to preserve the status quo, rather than to make any radical or changes
improvements in the game itself, or the management of it.

  My mistake.  My point was meant to encompass the cost of development AS
WELL as the additional resources required by Verant to support these
expansions (the cost of development, running them on their servers, and
supporting customers with new tech issues that arise, ect.)  Perhaps I'm
biased as someone who doesn't advance in level at a voracious pace and has
yet to have seen probably 65% of all of the game's current "content", but if
creating and supporting these expansions is so expensive and forcing their
cost of doing business to rise, perhaps they show be slowing down the pace
at which they release expansions, rather than doing what they seem to be
doing, and working to release expansions at a quicker pace.

  Maybe.  I know that part of the "cost of doing business" is competing,
keeping up with the rest of the industry, and to do that they need something
flashy and new to keep the interest of a lot of current customers, and bring
in new ones.  Better customer service, and more thoroughly tested software
sound great and almost everyone will say they want it, but it doesn't have
the sex appeal of colorful graphics, new quests, new skills and new areas.
