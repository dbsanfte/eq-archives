Whoa there Khosh, hang up the assumptions at the door, if you please. You
mean staying on induction?  ACtually, no, I didn't do the extreme diet.

I was on a low-carb, not no-carb, as well.  I don't think _anyone_ does a
no-carb diet.  If they do, they need someone to talk to them.  Even His
HOliness Dr. Atkins says 20g at least.  I tended to have about 40g/day.

Just because I didn't like the diet doesn't mean I was a clueless git who
didn't know how to do the diet.  I am well aware that some fruits are
ok.  Apples, however, are extremely starchy, so I did avoid them.  

As it stands, people are different.  My husband remained on induction
perpetually, and he LOVED the diet. I don't think he's ever been happier.  
The only reason he went off is because meat is more expensive than
ruffage.  As soon as we've finished paying for our move, he'll probably go
back on because he feels better when he's on it.

I kept at it for 3 months. I finally accepted that the cravings would not
go away, and I gave up.  I am one of those you would say are addicted to
carbs, or at least my body is.  I spent an afternoon one day reading
through epinions.com about the diet, and it became fairly clear that
low-carb is a dream-come-true to some, and pure hellish nightmare for
others, and it all depends on your own body.  My damned husband didn't
have one single craving, the lucky b*stard, and I couldn't go a few hours
without having to pep-talk myself.   

I've often wondered if I would have done better on permanent induction,
because after 3-4 days of that I actually hit that "no cravings" sweet
spot.  Then I did like the diet suggested and slowly added back 'safe
carbs'.  I guess they weren't safe enough, because I no longer found that
sweet spot again.

But it's all good.  Weight-loss isn't an issue for me anymore, muscle tone
is, and no diet can give you that.
