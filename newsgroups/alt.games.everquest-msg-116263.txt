I always thought /pet guard here was so you could pull mobs back to your pet
since he apparently WONT pull them back to you...or is there a way to send
him after one and make him come running back with it?

Though in Orc1 in EC, I decided rather than to /pet get lost for my green
con pet, since the group could handle it, I pulled the orcs that had
spawned.
I targeted the one in the middle,
/pet attack
or more like
/pet suicide mission

Like when playing Baldur's Gate, rather than disband an unwanted group
member, I'd strip them of any useful items or anything I wanted, and see how
long and how well they could melee-solo the oncoming monsters while the rest
of the party fought with ranged weapons.  It was sometimes fun to see a weak
character who is about to be replaced with a much better one (or even
slightly better) solo something so hard that their body would shower the
party in blood and body parts, making room for the soon to be added
member...much more useful to the group to send them into battle, only to
have their body ripped apart and exploded all over anyone nearby, rather
than to say to them, "I don't want you any more, get lost!".
