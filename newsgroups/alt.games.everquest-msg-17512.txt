Absolutely not!
Infact, any spell that has the same "effect" generally clobbers each
other.  Even spells that don't have the same original intent.

For example, druid's Natureskin and Skin Like Nature both have a regen
effect.  That regen effect is what causes necro's pact line of spells
(where they transfer their hitpoints to you) to overwrite the buff.
So we have a hitpoint transfer spell clobbering a AC/hp buff because
of a very minor regen effect.

This is one of the "exploits" that Conquest used.  Rez effect has both
a snare and slow effect.  The fourth warder's AoE was an AoE DoT and
Slow.  Because rez effect is absolutely un-overwritable (they made
sure it's impossible for someone to get around the rez effect), the
AoE DoT couldn't stick.  Making anyone with the rez effect "immune" to
the AoE.
