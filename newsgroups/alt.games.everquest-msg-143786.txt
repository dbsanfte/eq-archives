I'd do a search on your race/class specific items with AC for particular
slots.  One haste item is invaluable to a warrior too, even at the cost of
other important stats.  If you don't find nifty things that way, try
searching on HP items.  If your Dex or Agi are below 75, find things to
raise them that high.  If your Stamina is below 100, find items to raise it
that high.

Get your Dex, Agi, and Sta up to those levels, even at the expense of some
AC.  Same goes for haste.  After you have taken care of those, AC, then HP.
