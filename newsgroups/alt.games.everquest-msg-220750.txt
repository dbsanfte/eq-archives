And worse, if you stand there for 3 whole cycles of taunt, I'm 
probably going to have to remezz.  Just break it and heal me already. :)

}Try this instead:
}When MT's target hits 15 pct, slow the next mob and root it.  MT walks over,
}wakes it, and goes to town.  By the time root breaks (Greater Fetter, in my
}case) the mob has forgotten all about little old me.

Heh, much too late. :) Our fastest slow takes 3 seconds to cast, and the 
life expectancy of a mob at 15% is what, 1 second?  And you wanna get a 
root in there too!  :) 

Or perhaps I just group with too many wizards.  But I'd slow the next mob 
at about 50-80%.  Root optional, long as arcane rune's up. :)
