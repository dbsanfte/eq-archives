He's not speaking of trades genericly Ben.  He's speaking of the old,
old days.  Back when Rubicite was dropping.  Back when <nobody> sold
SMR/FBSS/MithrilTwoHander/SSoY/GEB/Ghoulbane, because once you had
about 10kpp you had no more use for pp in the game.  None.  Zero.
Zip.  So people /auctioned:  "SMR  trade only" when they had an SMR
they didn't need, looking for something useful.  Note, the best thing
about the old days was nobody put "pst" onto the end of their auctions.
Then Hate, the first open-ended EQ pp-sink, opened.  Everything after
that was just icing on the cake.
