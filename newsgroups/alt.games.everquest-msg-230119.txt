Hi all,

Thought you could help me out with a couple quick questions:

- If an item is recommended for use at a level higher than your current
(alternate stats in red), will a focus effect on that item work regardless
of your level or will in not kick in until you have achieved the
recommendation?

- Ceremonial Iksar Breastplate- What is the effective level of this item?  I
have seen posted elsewhere that it may be good until mid 30's but really
drops off after.  In terms of use it will be for wearing when sitting for
downtime only. Being a Troll with roughly 1200 (level 24) hp will this be
any better given my natural regen?  It's almost twice as much on my server
as I have seen on others (20k ish) and really wouldn't want to invest the
cash unless there would be a notable trade-off.

Thanks
