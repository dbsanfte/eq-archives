Like so much else in the game, it's certainly not *necessary* as such. Just a
convenience.  The particular instance where it came up was when my partner
(39 cleric) was suddenly getting bombarded with rez requests when we had some
nice steady pulling going, and I was wondering if any of the anon's in the
zone were also rez capable clerics.  Would have let me know if it was even
worth telling the unfortuante deceased to try shouting for a rez from another
cleric rather than cooling their heels waiting on ours.
  (And before anyone jumps in with the "if they're anon they don't want to be
bothered" line, the count function wouldn't tell you *who* they were, just
that there was one or more there. They could still ignore the /shout request
if they really didn't want to help out.)
  Might be other uses for the count function, but none come to mind this
early on only one cup of coffee.
