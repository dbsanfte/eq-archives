I'd be happy if they just had one bank for buff-type spells,
and then the usual 8-gem bank for non-buffs.

I've gotten sick and tired of swapping a ton of buff spells through
the same one or two spell gems every time I need to recast something.

It would make sense, too -- buffs are generally done during
downtime, when you have plenty of time to swap spells and
there's no "strategy" involved in what you have memmed or not,
the only thing that the "8 only" limitation adds to buffs is
a lot of shuffling and annoyance.

To balance things, I wouldn't mind if the "buff bank" of memmed
spells added an extra-long cast time component (at least as long
as it actually takes you to open your book and mem the spell),
and couldn't be fired in combat, and were treated as if you had
a Channeling skill of zero (i.e., they would interrupt if
anything even looked at you funny).

Or more simply, maybe buffs (and only buffs) could be fired
right from the spellbook.
