Bingo.

You can argue semantics all you like but there is no 'Court of Human
Rights' in EQ and because you are dealing with a human a certain degree
of how anally retentive the person in power is, comes into play.

If the GM doesn't like your name because his girlfriend just dumped him
and he hates the world, there's very little you can do about it. Name
changes, like other decisions, will generally be upheld even if you go
over their heads, simply because decisions have to be supported. If
'grey area' names are reversed by Lead GMs too often, it'll be common
practice to demand to speak to a Lead GM every time your 'Dildo Buggins'
gets a name change. Frankly, Lead GMs have more important things to do.
