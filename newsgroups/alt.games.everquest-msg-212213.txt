    The process works something like this:

    (1) Move a character with the same name as your main to Stormhammer from
the target server.
    (2) Move your main to Stormhammer. Because of the name conflict, your
main will now be called "Namex" if you were called "Name" to begin with.
    (3) Delete the alt with your original name.
    (4) Use the free name change that all Stormhammer players get to change
your name back to the original.
    (5) Tell a GM that you'd like to move back to your server, which is
(server the alt came from). GM will see that a character of that name on
your account came from that server, and will move you. They won't question
any level or gear difference that doesn't really stand out (eg. Manastone to
a non-Manastone server) because, after all, you could have got your XP/gear
on Stormhammer.

    As long as you don't do all of this within one month, they won't
question it. At least they didn't used to question it back when some
less-than-reputable guilds were using this process to get fully geared
cross-server applicants.
