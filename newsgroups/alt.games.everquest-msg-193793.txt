Well  I left a level 30, then came back and did 32-34 in the Warrior
Room group (stopped off whilst passing through on Bard Lambet armour
quest). I could probably do another couple of levels there I guess,
gaining 1/2 blue tic per kill {:-(.

Theoretically you can stay until everything turns green. Practically,
unless you are a very strong fighter and have excellent crowd control,
your limitation is going to be getting into a group where you will be
accepted. 

If you can avoid midnight to 6am London time (GMT +/- 0)[1], which is
the USA evening period, then you should have less trouble getting into a
group. Mainly because there is less people around for people to argue
about and be picky. Around London 8am time, there is often not enough
people for a full group anyway, but tonight there was a full group
pulling GR, LR & WR of 30-32. Other days there will be you and your
shadow.

Sometimes there is a higher level WR group during the busy periods, but
you can wait a few hours to get into it.

Higher level who solo are usually chasing items like Amstar's Scroll.

Word of Warning, you can not always rely on the guards to cover your
solo arse if you pull a big group from GR/LR/WR/RR by yourself (or in a
group even). A few times I've had to flee the zone recently because
someone has been plat farming and killed all the lower level guards.


[1] Yes, I know Greenwich isn't in Londow, but slightly west.
