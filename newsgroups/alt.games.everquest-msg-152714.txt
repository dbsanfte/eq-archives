That's not the impression I get from the patch message.

*This* is the impression I get from the patch message.

I think the warning about "getting less exp than from a single group"
clause was just a ham-handed way of reminding people that when you
divide the exp from a kill by 30 raid members, everyone's going to
get less exp (for that one kill) than would the 6 members of
the pre-/raid "KS group".

It isn't necessary to "nerf XP all to hell" to prevent everyone
in a dungeon from joining a raid just for exp sharing, because
it would be foolish for anyone in a decent group to do that in
the first place.

Joining a zone-wide "exp group" would result in most competent players
getting hosed on exp because they're sharing it with sluggards
who are just standing around picking their noses in a safe spot,
and/or having their exp siphoned off by the Usual Suspects
who can never get their act together and get a steady kill rate going.

If I'm in a good (or even so-so) group, why on earth would 
I dilute my exp in a zone-wide /raid group?

...not to mention having an unscrupulous zonewide /raid leader
suddenly make everything I kill so that only *he*
can loot it...
