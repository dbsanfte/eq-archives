This reminds me of when I was actioning off a Crystal Chitin Shield as
I was going through Gfay.  I get a tell from a young ranger saying he
wants to know if he could borrow my Shield because he wants to make
his Trueshot and really needs the wisdom boost.  I told him no that I
wasnt going to let a total stranger BORROW an 8k item.  Pestered the
daylites out of me.  Worst part is that he was sincere.  He turned out
to be the little brother of a friend of mine in the game that I WOULD
have let borrow it LOL.

The kid was funny though.  I asked him what his fletching was at and
he said 58.  I told him that Trueshots arent even trivial to ME at 206
(at the time) and that his skill is too low to expect any kind of
success.   Still wanted it because "I" didnt understand that the
wisdom would help him.  Not even after I explained that his Wisdom
doesnt affect whether he succeeds or fails, just whether he will get a
skill up out of it.

It will never cease to amaze me how many people expect the
unbelievable out of complete strangers.  These same people would NEVER
let a complete stranger borrow thier new Ferrari just because they
need to get to the store in  hurry=)
