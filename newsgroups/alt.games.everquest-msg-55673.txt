Ya know, I've heard you mention this pit a number of times, but I'm
hoping I'm not thinking of the same one. The only "pit" I know of in
Perma is the one you fall into if you don't make the turn into Vox's
lair in time and fall through the trap. Bunch of spiders and stuff down
there. (Yes, I learned this the "hard way" on my first Vox Raid.)

But to get to that pit, you generally have to go the route you take to
get to Vox, right? Past the Ice Giant Diplomat, etc. etc. etc.  That
doesn't sound like a good route for a small party. Or is there a
different pit or another entrance?
