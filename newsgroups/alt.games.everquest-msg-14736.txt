From the rare times that I found myself soloing my monk, I can see where
this situation would come in VERY handy, and that's because of mend. It
always seemed like, when I was obviously on the losing end of a close
fight, that mend always took just a *little* too long to recycle before I
would die/feign/run, etc.  If I fought that brute down to near death, using
my mend, and continuing the battle until I was nearly dead, I can see how a
feign, then start binding wounds for 30 seconds or so might give mend
enough time to recycle. Hit that, and even though the mob is regenning
fast, you've probably gotten WAY more hit points back than him, so you can
start the fight back up with a buffer of HP.
