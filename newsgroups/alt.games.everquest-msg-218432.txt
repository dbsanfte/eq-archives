I'm not seeing the difference you are alluding to. What term??

Examples:

Person with fractured leg... slips and falls in an puddle without a 
warning sign... makes preexisting condition worse == theatre liability 
for 'worseness'

Person with fractured mind ... slips further from reality in a virtual 
environment without a warning sign... makes preexisting condition worse 
-- might be some liability there for SoE for the 'worseness'.
