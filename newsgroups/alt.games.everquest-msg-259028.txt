That was the "old way" of computer games. Now the "new way" is to just put 
a flimsy waste of paper called a manual in a now shrunken carboard box and 
throw in some CD's in paper sleeves. I would rather have a sturdy DVD case 
to store my game media in than a manual I'm not willing to read anyway.

I know a lot of gamer friends and NONE of them give two flying flips about 
game manuals. I think it's the relatively few who actually relish reading 
game manuals, and the rest of us would rather see games that put their 
effort in the game itself. As for backstories and supplemental information, 
I think that should be done in-game, either through cutscenes, in-engine 
scripted sequences, or stuff like that. Look at how well Starcraft 
integrated the story into a strategy game. Much better than putting it in a 
manual I'm not likely to read (and no, I don't think I bothered reading my 
Starcraft manual either).

So to me if the choice is "manuals vs. DVD case" it's a no brainer. I would 
much prefer the DVD case. Put the minimal manual needed in with the DVD 
case, it's got room for one adaquate for most of the games worth playing 
anyway. I can think of a few genres where thick manuals might be essential 
but I'm generally not in the target audience for those genres so I don't 
care. :)
