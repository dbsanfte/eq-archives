large acrylia bricks are basically not used at all. The leather armor is
usefull and it uses boning from small bricks and studs from pieces. A large
brick can be made into a single small brick and a small brick can be made
into two pieces. There is a very minor (like 5%) chance of losing a large
brick when trying to break it into a small brick thus for you to sell the
large bricks you will need to charge small brick price-5%-annoyance of
getting smithing stuff oughta twinky holder.

large bricks can also be used to make chainmail and combined into blocks to
make platemail but neither armor is actually usefull for anyone.
