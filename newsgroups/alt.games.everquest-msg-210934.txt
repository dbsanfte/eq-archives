There is, kind of.  There's a cap on how much experience you can get off one
kill, and at lower levels it tends to be hit on mobs 5 to 10 levels higher.

I think the cap is purely a percentage-based formula based on my last
hardcore PL'ing session where I found out that it takes exactly 30 mobs,
each giving max exp, to get through level 30.  31 for level 31, 32 for level
32, etc.  It held true up til 39 when I ran into difficulties finding
someplace with the right mob levels to keep the exp max'ing (that was also
suitable for magician PL'ing).
