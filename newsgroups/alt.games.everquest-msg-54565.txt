Not all the Kobolds see invis.  Just those next to Kobold
Shaman.  That cast the "See Invisible" spell on themselves
and those around them and those wanderers that pass
near them.

Bats do, including Vampire bats in Lower Guk (bats
are suceptible to sneak though, like EVERY mob in
the whole world of Norrath).  Not too sure about LDCs,
simply because I've never passed in front of one while
sneak/hiding.  Sneak/hiding is great, but I'll count on
the guarauntee of sneak over the 99% of hide any day.
If I have to go3 steps out of the way to walk behind that
warrior in SolB, I'll do it!
