I have been playing EQ for 4 years now on and off. I would play, get bored,
then a few months later either an expansion or a cool patch would bring
something new to the game. So I'd come back and play some more. It's been
like that until yesterday when my account password was changed and I
couldn't do anything about it. Why? My brother had been using the account
behind my back after he figured out my password and had paid it last couple
of times leaving me without my game. I can't play EQ anymore, guess it's
time to move on. That's why I need your help.

There are many MMORPG's out there at the moment, Asheron's Call 2,
Shadowbane, Neocron, Anarchy Online, Star Wars Galaxies ect. ect.

I need to know which one's have you played and what your thoughts were on
the game. I need to find a new game to play when I'm bored, so your opinions
will influence my decision. I'm turning to the experts, my fellow EQ
players. So tell me what you think.

Thanks.
