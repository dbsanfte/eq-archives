I have seen this on one of our laptops, a Compaq which houses an ATI RAGE 3d
chip. I did get rid of the cursor by changing a setting on the driver
options for the chip in windows. Unfortunately I do not recall the exact
setting, the laptop is currently afield and proved too slow for playability
with the new engine, <grumble>. You might also look at the settings on your
mouse driver, depending on your OS there may be a port buffer and a reads
per second type adjustment, try increasing one or both. Good Luck Mr. Phelps
