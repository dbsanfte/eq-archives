Theres often days where *nothing* at all is up.   You can lose the FCFS race
on mob_xxx and then not find another mob for the next 3 days.. and then the
week after, you can kill (using my guild as an example)

Last wednesday -
Zlandicar
PoH - mage epic thing
King Tormax
Sleepers Tomb
Velkator
Cazic Thule
Vindicator
Statue of Ralloz Zek
Lord Yelinak
Dain Frostreaver x 2

The weekend just gone -

Cazic Thule
Dozekar the Cursed
Ikatiar the Venom
Eashen of the Sky
Rumblecrush
Sleeper's Tomb x 2
King Tormax x 2
Ring of Slime
Statue of Rallok Zek x 2
Vindicator x 2
Lord Yelinak

Going back a bit further, we did 5 (yes FIVE) dains in a row, followed by 7
other mobs that day.. and then spent the next few days with nada to kill.
if you don't kill them there and then tho, they don't stay

Sucks to be us :(   Well maybe not you, but your sitting pretty at the top
heh

What I read the weekend about "new" ST indicates its going to be a full raid
zone again.. no more 1 group clearings of all the named

Heh been there done that..  had a guild try and FCFS us on a mob we were
ready for, us to kill/loot, and then FCFS them on the very next mob we went
for... also went from zone to zone, losing out on 3 mobs in a row, before
most people just logged off in frustration

Isnt 94% about what you guys got him to on your first try.. I didnt pay all
that close attention to dates, but it was a few weeks before that 94% became
0%

We have 4 guilds going for the high-end stuff (ssra)

Greig isnt something we kill, so I dont really know what marker this is.. he
doesn't seem super tough.. maybe a little tougher than The Itraer Vius?

We have 5+ ntov guilds (who can clear it), another 2 who can kill the gimpy
dragons once Aary is down, and 2 more who can do Itik/Eashern.. maybe
another 5 guilds who can do Doze too

Only the emp would stay up more than a day on Prexus, and thats cuz only 1
guild is capable of killing him.  So its common for that guild to race for
whatever they feel like doing, knowing they can leave Emp for a quiet day.
First Broods and Tormax don't even last 30 minutes, ever.

I zoned into Sleepers Tomb last night to check spawns, and there were FIVE
different guilds with 1-5 people in the zone just sat tracking from the
zoneline, waiting for stuff to spawn.. thats ridiculous imo
