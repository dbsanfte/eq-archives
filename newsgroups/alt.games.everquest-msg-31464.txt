Vanessa Kensington: Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimatize you to the 
nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967.

promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection while at the 
same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free 
environment, I'll be sound as a pound!
