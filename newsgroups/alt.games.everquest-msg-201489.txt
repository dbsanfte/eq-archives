I assume you have been in a group wth someone when they did the quest to
gain access to Tactics. You can exp in there but flags are meaningless. You
can participate in the fights but you will need a flag from Behemoth kill in
PoI to make flags obtained within Tactics valid. Zeks are one step on the
path for Elemental planes.
