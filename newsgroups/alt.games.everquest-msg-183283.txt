Ok, I have a necro who has some shoulders that have Summoning Haste 2
on them... they work rather nicely...  I recently aquired a Range Item
that has Summoning Haste 4.  
When casting I notice that only the Shoulder item reacts, so I remove
shoulders in attempt to watch my new range item do its things...

Nothing...  I ponder and think that the focus effect may not happen
every time, so I cast several more times..  Nothing..

WTF am I missing here... as I understand from a recent patch Focus
Summoning effects all pets now, BL, Necro, Mages, etc...
As i understand each level covers all spells up to a certain level..
is that not true beyond level 3?, and if so anyone have a good
refrence page that covers all this nitty gritty info?

Thanks
