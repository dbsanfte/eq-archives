All of them, or as many as you can. The reason is there are EXCELLENT
weapons of every category now (there didn't use to be pre-Kunark), and
you never know when you're going to get your hands on one, so it
behooves you to keep them all maxed. If you start early, in your teens,
then it is trivially easy to keep them maxed every level after that,
especially as an SK with high int. Some of the good mid-high end ones
are: Noctavigent Blade for 1hs; Deathbringer's Rod for 2hb; Mace of
Shadowed Souls for 1hb; 2hs are legion, obviously :); piercing, well I
am unsure of any sort of super high end one, but at low-mid levels that
Stalag Terror Spine Spear is pretty nice. At the uber-uber levels there
things like the Black Rock Maul of Crushing or whatever it's called,
it's a blunt weapon; good luck getting that, though!

Good choice =). It doesn't look special, but it sure has some nice
stats. The real reason, though, to choose it over the Wurmslayer is that
it has better raw ratio of damage/delay, plus the lower delay allows the
damage bonus to kick in more frequently.

Not really, if you're low level, then just get whatever you can find, FS
or velium if nothing else, and go at it every level. If you are already
25+, then yeah, do a search and find the lowest delay ones you can
afford, and maybe ask a group hunting things yellow and red to you if
you can practice on their mobs.
