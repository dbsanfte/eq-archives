With the "snare and run backwards" technique good for the first 30 levels
and SoW + Stinging Swarm added into the mix after 30, archery is about right
for rangers.

Time works out the ~same. Instead of taking 5 minutes to kill something and
5 minutes sitting on your butt recovering from the fight, you spend 10
minutes running backwards. You also have the chance to kill some really
tough cons.

It's the other bow using classes that suffer if they do anything other then
pull with a bow.

You have to guess at one time VI knew what they were doing when they didn't
let bards<selo>, shaman or druids<SoW> use bows for a reason.
