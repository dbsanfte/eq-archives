W007! First J-Boots, now 51! Dinged early this morning ~1:30am (instead
of getting plenty of rest to get to work on time - I was an hour late
<:) ) And I'm on pretty good track of getting Greenmist soon :D

And for most of the evening and early morning, I was getting heckled by
a power-levelling group for choosing to keep to small groups of
close-to-same levels. Though I appreciate the 70 beastlord stopping by
to heal us from time to time, I do kinda wish they had just let us be.
And stopped training the entire zone, including the mobs I needed for
the Greenmist quest.
