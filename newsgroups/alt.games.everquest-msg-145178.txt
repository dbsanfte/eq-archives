Tremendous exageration, combined with a risk vs. reward question, Kaev.
The number of truly could caster quadding and solo spots is quite
limited, in reality. They are highly contested and vicious fights break
out over them. And for the single pull ones, there's hardly any that a
very small group of melee, particularly if you throw in any sort of
healer (fuck, even a palidin) couldn't handle. The ONLY one I can think
of off the top of my head is the Allyzewsaur, and ya know what? Yes, a
necro can solo him and a melee can't. But it takes the necro god damned
near a half hour to do it, usually eats the pet, and a full bar of mana
and then they sit on their ass forever to med up. In that time a coule
melee could do ten or twenty mobs and get more xp.

Risk vs. reward. Yeah, people hate quadders. But again, ya know what?
The stuff we quad, whether it's spirocs, or wyverns in CS, etc. etc. you
can always do with a couple melee plus some healer. And ya know what
else? If you pull a couple you can usually take them. Ya know what
happens when a quad catches up to a quadding wizzie? Even just for
second to stun them once? 

Yep.

/auc Looking for a rez. Will donate.

Risk vs. reward.

So start a caster.

You'll find it's not all peaches and cream.
