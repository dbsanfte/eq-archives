 >Not to interested in hearing Verant's official rules on the matter. Just

I was camping Hadden in preparation for a Kedge Keep
raid next week.  I'd killed him 3 times and had his
spawn time pretty well down.  As a melee character, I
don't have the "bind here, play somewhere else" option.
I log off and play an alt, work at home, other things.

I log back on 10 minutes before he pops.  There is a level 58
wizard there.  He tells me that he's been waiting on Hadden
for 4 hours, and I have to go away.

I tell him that not only is Hadden popping in about 10-15 minutes,
and that his 4 hours was wasted, but that the first person to
touch him has the right to kill him, whether by him aggro'ing
you or you smacking/casting on him.

He said "I don't care who touches him first, one nuke will
take him down."

/report
/petition "There is a guy here in Q. Hills that says that it doesn't
matter to him if I smack a critter first, he's going to KS him."

A GM told me about 30 seconds (30 second response in EQ!)
"I'm here and will watch for a bit."

Hadden pops, I backstab him for about 200 and quad attack
him.  Hadden doesn't like me.

Wizzy boy lets this go on for about 5 seconds, then drops him
with one spell.  GM "appears" and teaches wizzy a few things
about play nice.  He doesn't care that the wizzy had been
sitting there for 4 hours.  He doesn't care that it takes longer
for a wizzy to start to cast a spell then it takes an invis rogue
to take one step forward and backstab.

I hit him first.  He was mine.  The wizzy KS'd, and was
caught red-handed by a GM _after_ explaining to me he
was gonna KS.  I got my Fishbone Earring.
;-)

How does this apply?  Say the pharmer is pulling all 3,
and you have a strong enough level appropriate group
to take frenzy if you want.  Move on down.  Explain that
you're coming.  If he tells you something to the effect of
"I'm here alone and you can't be," report and petition
him.  Pharmers should NOT be allowed to hang around
when a level appropriate group is down somewhere
hunting for gear, whether it be FBSS's in Guk or barbed
arms in Befallen.

The same also applies to full groups, but here's where
there's a little leeway.  Under Play Nice, your group is
fully justified in moving in with the full group frenzy camp
and rotating spawns.  But it's gonna mess up your reputation
with that group, their guild(s), and everybody they know.
It's just not worth it for a piece of loot you can get later or
buy in East Commons.

Pharmers, however, should die.  A lot.  And be banned.
And then burned at a stake.  I don't care what their guild
thinks or says if they're the type of guild that condones
their level 60 necro taking the Frenzy away from a group
of 45's who are barely holding the camp, getting great
exp and loot, and having the time of their lives.
