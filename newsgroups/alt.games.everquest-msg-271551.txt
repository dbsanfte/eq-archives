Umm, Jim the more I read your responses the more I wonder why you are 
playing a Massively Multiplayer game where you do not seem to want any 
interaction with other players. I mean, why blow the 13 bucks a month 
when maybe you'd have a lot more fun in a game like Morrowind or 
something that is designed from the ground up for solo play. But as you 
said, it's your 13 bucks so who am I to tell you how to play where it is 
never going to impact other players of the game.

Are you aware that necros, beastlords and druids are some of the best 
solo classes in the game and that most would agree that the necro is the 
best solo class of them all? I am just wondering because I think most 
would agree that the warrior class is among the worst choices you could 
make for solo play if not the worst, if you would like to play that 
character to high levels over time.

If you are going to play EverQuest solo all the time, you might enjoy a 
necro a whole lot more than a warrior. I am not going to tell you how to 
play of course. It is just a suggestion for you to consider, with your 
fun in mind.

I suppose if you set your mind to it perhaps you could solo a warrior 
all the way but I don't know why anyone would want to do that with all 
the downtime it would involve. In fact, I wonder if anyone has ever 
actually done that before. The higher you get the harder stuff is going 
to start hitting you and the more painful and time consuming it is going 
to be to recover from that if you live through the battle at all. This 
is why I was of the opinion earlier that you would not solo this warrior 
for long before you had to group and learn to function effectively in a 
group with him. But if you are never going to do that, then none of this 
discussion applies to you or your warrior anymore. And having told us 
that there's no need for you to take any of the commentary personally 
either since not a word of it applies to you anymore.

Be that as it may, if you like playing solo in the world of Norrath 
that's cool. But I would encourage you to look into playing a Necro, 
Beastlord, Druid, maybe a Mage or something like that where you can be a 
whole lot more effective for a whole lot longer than you will ever be 
with the warrior.

And one last thing, calling folks twits who express an opinion, whether 
you like it, agree with it, or do not, does little to further your own 
argument whatever it may be. You could have told people in this thread a 
long time ago that you intend to play solo exclusively and always, with 
this toon and there wouldn't have been an issue to discuss, at least not 
one pertaining to this particular warrior.
