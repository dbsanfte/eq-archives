    I wish other guilds on our server were as ambitious. I think a few of
them got nothing but shawls off him once, because the competition would not
kill him no matter how long he was up. And the lesser guilds that are still
RC-capable never seemed to know when he was up. That's changed now that
Umbral is more popular, but it didn't help us at the time.

    Ah, ok. Now it makes sense. We usually just pull him to the open area
right beside the stairs. Nice short pull, no stupid adds during the pull,
you still get no adds during the fight, and you don't mess with anyone else
in the zone that way. But he does tend to move around a bit during the
fight. ;-)
