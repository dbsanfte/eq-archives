It's really easy (so much so it's probably going to be nerfed to buggery
soon). Just hail Inkeep James in North Karana (Northwest from the gypsy
camp) to get the quest. He'll instruct you to get some bread from Jarlen
Meadowgreen at the centaur village in South Karana. You pay him 2gp, get
the bread back to James, and he'll pay you anything from 1 to 3pp, and
give you an amount of XP roughly equivalent to a blue kill at mid to
high twenties. If you are a druid, porting/gating make this quest
extremely fast, but even if you are stuck with running, it's worth it. I
was getting almost a yellow bubble of xp a pop with a lvl 10 bard...
Then again, the run is not trivial at level 10, even with Selo's... Got
to dodge everything.
