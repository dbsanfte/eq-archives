Thank you for your replies.

I ended up going into the NE or SE corners of Greater Faydark and
parking my butt there whilst playing DDD overnight/afk periods. Brass
now maxed at 165. 

I did not need to be affecting anything. Perhaps it happens faster, at
higher levels if you do affect something. I notice that increasing
strings and drum doesn't currently respond to butt sitting whilst
practising.

Also, might be affected by the non-random random number generator in the
computer that allows you to go up 3-4 skill levels in a minute, then
take six hours to increment to the next level.


Someone suggests sitting on top of the wizard spires. Mentioned becaused
it didn't make it to the list. Hmm, so I went to see and yep, you can
climb them okay. Warning, take off Selo's BEFORE you attempt to come
down. Splat, 740hp damage (thank goodness for a random
drive-by/drive-bye buffing just prior that took me over the 800hp level
so I survived and didn't loose experience).

Not related, but another recent ker-splat event was running up the gorge
in East Karanas close to High Pass zone with Selo's+drum (distracted by
one hand typing on the other keyboard) and right turn - splat - you have
died. "Bugger". Not a totally useless event - Oh, so thats where the
sister of the clothesspinner in Qeynos is. So now I know where to find
the person that my qeynos warrior has to deliver a note to. No idea who
the guy in armour is. Just thought I'd throw this(these) tidbit(s) in.


Some of you missed the point that I do not have any expansion packs, but
your comments might be useful for those who do have them.


What I found really frustrating after maxing the brass and checking that
it did work well (heh heh, what else are crushbone orcs good for {:-),
was to go grouping to the Unrest basement and watch half your group die
in the blink of an eye. WTF!. Not being able to respond is really
frustrating. (The people who died think it is a bug around the festering
hag as she was involved all 4 times and no one was suffering lag).

Anyway thanks.
