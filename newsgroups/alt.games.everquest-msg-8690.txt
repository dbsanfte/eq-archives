Nonsense. JBoots are easily fast enough to outrun _any_ creature that hasn't
been buffed with SoW or similar, or is naturally fast (like Shadowed Men).
Yeah they are a little slower than SoW but that's hardly a problem. They are
faster than walking which is a boon to any non-SoW casting, non-Gating
character with a long journey ahead. That and the instant cast-time makes
them invaluable (try channeling a SoW potion with 0 Channel Skill and 3 misc
Dreadlands mobs beating on you).
