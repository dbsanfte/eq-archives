Necromancer or Beastlord are both good.  Necro can Fear mobs and
adequately snare them with one of the Darkness dots.  The Beastlord is
a good fighter, as is the pet, and the pet can soon nuke for a decent
amount, too.  I have one of each, and it's 50/50 which one I prefer -
others may be more partisan, mind you  :)
