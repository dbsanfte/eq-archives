I had my p3 800 upgraded to WIn XP, - clean install, 512 MB, nvidia Geforce
2 ti with 64MB. My other software is office 2000.  When I loaded SOL it was
nonfunctional - I did 3 total installs but am left with the same issues.
When I load game, I get a bleed through of the desktop into char select
screen and 99 percent of the time I get a you are disconnected message after
trying to enter the game.  When I try to enter the game again it says you
have an active char and I can not try to relog for 15 mins or so.  On the
rare occasions I have gotten into the game the sound is terribly distorted -
Soundbalster Live 5.1 with latest creative drivers.  I though it was my
machine so I got Shogun and Return to Wolfenstein and the ran flawless. I
was then curious so I got Dark Age of Camelot to test the connection. Not a
problem there - all of these games have pretty much identical hardware
requirements and they run flawlessly. DOAC si very much EQ like and a blast
to play.  I simply want to play my lvl 50 and 41 EQ chars and not my lvl 5
DOAC chars. So what gives - there are lots on playing with no problems and
the chat rooms are full of people with problems. My EQ tech letters come
back saying my problem should have been solved but the tech support line is
always busy or closed when I called.  The tech chat is hours of waiting and
then the tech leaves and really nothing is getting solved there. I am at a
standstill as what to do. Thanks.
