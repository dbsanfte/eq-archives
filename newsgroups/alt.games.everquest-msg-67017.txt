In a word, upgrade. Even if only the CPU. I started out on an AMD K6-3
300MHz. Was smooth some of the time, but a lot of the time I had some
trouble. I should also mention though that I only started with 32MB of RAM
and a 16MB card.

Your card and RAM should make up a bit for the lack in CPU, but even if you
only upgrade to somewhere between 400-600MHz, you'll have a much easier time
across the board. And, chips in that range whether AMD or Pentium can be had
rather cheaply these days, provided that you don't also have to upgrade your
motherboard as well.
