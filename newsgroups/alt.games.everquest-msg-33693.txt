Here's the set-up:

I've got regen gear that I want my warrior to switch to when sitting and
combat gear that I want him to wear when he's standing and fighting.  What
is the fastest way of doing this?  A single macro social key would be the
ideal.  Click on it and he sits and auto-switches in all regen gear.  Click
it again and he stands up and auto-switching in combat gear for the regen
gear.

Now related question:

What's all the regen gear (and its regen rate and gear slot) in EQ that an
ogre warrior can wear?
