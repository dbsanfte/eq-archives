Allegedly wizards are the "masters of transportation", particularly
since the translocation spells have been added. Their destination points
are often more sought after, as well, then druidic ones, particularly by
evil races/classes because of the presence of killer NPCs around druid
rings.  After 46, they will also hold the only keys to two of the
planes. So, having said all that, if the *ONLY* (and I can't emphasize
enough the word "only") reason you want to make this character is for
transportation, and if you will have the help of your friends in
leveling him to 40 (a tough task for anyone with the misbegotten wizard
class) then that might be your best bet.
  Other than that, just go with the Druid, but be prepared to not have
as many grouping options in the high end game, again, unless you have a
pre-made circle of friends ready to welcome you in.
