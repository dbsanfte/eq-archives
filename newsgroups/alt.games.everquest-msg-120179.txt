people like this are idiots blaming the game because theyre psycho son
killed himself instead of blaming themselves for not raising a well adjusted
individual (not that i believe thats wholly the parents fault but theyre a
lot more important then some game in suicide cases) noone wants to accept
the blame or blame the dead person because we as a society have a phobia
about speaking bad of the dead. what bullshit!

so here is her name and address and phone number
      Elizabeth Woolley  Add to Address Book
      vCard
      642 Kinnickinnic St
      Hudson, WI 54016-1742
      (715) 381-5752


i think people should unite together and tell this woman that because her
son was stupid is no reason to blame a game.  maybe if enough people tell
here this, she wont spend tax money in court and our money for the lawsuit.
hell if were really lucky maybe shell go the way of her son and that will be
one less idiot in the world. evolution in action.
