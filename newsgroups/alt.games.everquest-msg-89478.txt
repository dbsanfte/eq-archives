Many (not all) quest can be done at dubious or better faction.

If you can successfully sneak behind a quest-giver and hand
him components, you will be automatically "indifferent" to him.
It allows rogues (and to a lesser degree, monks and halflings
and other such folks) to sell/bank/quest with folks that don't like
them.

You have to be sure that there are no KOS mobs close by
that will aggro you, but if you've got 'em alone you can just get
behind 'em, sneak, and do your deeds.  Rogues got the most
benefit out of it (not as many places have something against
monks or halflings), and started calling it "doing the secret
handshake" to buy/sell.
