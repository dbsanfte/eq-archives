All large companies which write complex software.

One single real programmer may or may not write shit software, 5, 30, 50,
100, 200 software developers working to inadequate specs will often combine
to write buggy software.

>The code is tested properly, then released, not released then tested...

Yes indeed, because we never have to apply maintenance patches to software
from big software houses?

Software development, on a large scale, results in bugs.  Massive testing
can demonstrate the existence of bugs, and never demonstrate the absence.

>But then real software costs a bomb.

Well, some of the least buggy code in the world is free - and it's the
least buggy, because it has the largest of test platforms.
