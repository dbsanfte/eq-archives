Quoth Lance Berg :

Lance, I agree with 90% of your post, and with Kerry's position for that 
matter, but I really have to take issue with this:

> Spain was wrong in allowing terrorist attacks to affect the change 
> they  wanted.

Spain has been fighting terrorism since the 60s, and has a long story of *
not* giving in to it, so any talk of "appeasement" is not only ignorant, 
but daft. The government that was so resoundingly kicked out had had a 
long and bitter feud with the Basque Country's own nationalist local 
government, and couldn't pass the opportunity to milk some political 
mileage out of the massacre, even as evidence was surfacing that those 
responsible were not ETA, but Islamic extremists.

People who previously couldn't be bothered to vote (because, with the 
stable economy, Aznar's party's re-election seemed almost guaranteed, in 
spite of universal opposition to the war) saw right through this, and 
the backlash was extraordinary. Result: Aznar's appointed successor (
Aznar himself was not running for a third term) was crushed, and the 
Socialists, who had made the withdrawal from Iraq a campaign issue, 
returned to power. 

Speaking as someone who has been woken up more than once by ETA bombs (I 
used to live not far from military family residences in Madrid), I can 
tell you that the Spanish are under no delusions whatsoever about where 
appeasing terrorism gets you -- and in fact, military commitment to the 
real war on terror, in Afghanistan, has increased since the Socialists 
came into power. That the attacks in Madrid were the catalyst of the 
government's downfall is undeniable; that that can be construed somehow 
as appeasement is either ignorance or mendacity. If your voting 
decisions are based on what you think the terrorists don't want, rather 
on what *you* want, then that's when you are entirely in their hands.
