I'm guessing you might benefit from a sense of humor.  When I first posted
waaaaay back when, I made the comment that I agreed that it would probably
never come to pass, but if it did I'd post an 'I told you so' message.

If I really had an axe to grind, I'd hit Google and dredge my original post
and subsequent thread up.  Been here for 2 years or so ... it's been done
before, and is not that hard to do.
