Its just about impossible to get kei on our server these days (from what im
told, im a kei caster). People are offering 150pp or more for kei, to which
I reply. I dont advertise. People are desperate and the offers are going up
and up. If theres a conspiracy, im not part of it tho.
Funny how people object to a set price. Maybe they should go and hassle
their local supermarket, or plumber. "Donations" is a bunch of bs anyway.
