 It wouldn't matter to me. I'd take any 35 warrior regardless of race if
that's what my group required. If I had to choose though between the two
I'd probably go for whichever one had a better reputation. If they were
both unknown to me I'd choose whichever one asked first.

 I think the major complaint about Iksar warriors was that they couldn't
wear the high end armor such as Cobolt therefore their AC suffered when
compared to other races. However, as you have said. there are Iksar
specific pieces that now drop along with Velious stuff. I'm not sure how
it stacks up but I'm thinking it's comparable.
