O.K. I missed part of it in Kaladim, but apparently an Iksar named Danak.
He then moved to the entrance of Felwithe, to confront a Dwarf named Thurbr.
Many words were exchanged, and a combat began.  Thurbr was "banished" and
then Danak made an offer:  Find and stop Firiona Vie from reaching her
contact with the Ring of Scale.
    Did this occur on other servers as well?  Did I forget anything major?
