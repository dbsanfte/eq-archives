Taunt isnt guaranteed to work, like any skill.

If you don't get agro its because your taunt didn't work, or you were so far
below the top person on the agro list.

"You will not evade me" is nothing to do with taunt working or not.  Its
when a person gets summoned, as your probably aware.. watch when somebody is
stood further back from the mob then you, if they have considerable agro and
are suddenly out of the mobs reach (i.e because the force of the hits pushed
the mob bac some) then that person will most likely get summoned.

And the reason for standing as far back as you can?  It reduces the risk of
agro, and on uber mobs, if you can't keep ago on 1 person you get wiped..
that simple.
