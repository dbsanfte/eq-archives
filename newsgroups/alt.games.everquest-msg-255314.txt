A friend of mine had this problem and it was his ISP that was screwed
up.  They had a faulty router or bad DNS or something that wouldn't
let their customers find SOE servers.  You might call them, wait on
hold an hour, get forwarded on to a few other people and finally find
someone who will not make you repeat your problem and try all of the
"fixes" they have on a list before they test their own equipment. 
Good luck if that is your problem.
