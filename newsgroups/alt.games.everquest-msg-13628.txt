It makes you secure against packet sniffers, but that is just one way to
get in.  My Linux box got cracked, and I'm on ISDN, with a dynamic IP
address.  I fell a couple weeks behind in reading CERT notices, and
someone scanning random IP addresses picked one I happened to have that
particular day, and they were exploiting a bug I hadn't applied a patch
for yet.

No serious damage was done...I noticed unexpected activity on the ISDN
modem, and hung up.  Later analysis showed that this interupted the download
of a rootkit about 3 seconds before it would have downloaded and run its
installation script.  Someone in China did get my password file, and had
it for about 20 minutes before I discovered all this, but that's not
long enough to break the encryption and do anything.
