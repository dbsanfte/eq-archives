Suggest you go to this URL and print a copy of the Shar Vahl map:

www.eqatlas.com

On the left of the opening page, click on "The Atlas", scroll down,
and click on Shar Vahl. 
There are 2 maps, one of the upper lvl, including the palace, and the
lower, lvl which is where the rogue trainer is located. He is in room
#9 of the lower lvl.
