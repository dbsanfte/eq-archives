Why?   I have a troll SK, and a iksar shaman (lvl 53ish and 60) and neither
has done a single days factioning in the old world/kunark, ever.

They can bank in Thurg and Skyshrine, and I can't see a reason for them to
ever have to shop elsewhere.

Ironically, my human monk is kos to half of the world.   Dubious or worse in
my starting city, bards hate me, tunare stuff hates me, inkies hate me,
giants and dragons regularly hate me

Still, dorfs like me at least (only been from ally-kos 3 times in thurg, and
no reason that will change anymore)
