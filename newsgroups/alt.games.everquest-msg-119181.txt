It's a balance issue, not a "penalty". Without the EXP "penalty" (when
the pet does more than 50% of the damage) pet classes would be much
more powerful than non-pet classes. Pet classes already level faster
and easier with the "penalty". It would be obscene how fast they would
level if it was removed.

I look at it this way.....If I was playing a non-pet class, and
grouped with another player I would always lose  @50% exp (depending
on the difference in levels between us) to that other player no matter
who does the most damage.

If you group with another player it gets even better.......With your
pet, you now have a 3 person group, and you only have to split the exp
2 ways (odds are the pet can't out-damage both you and the other
player)
