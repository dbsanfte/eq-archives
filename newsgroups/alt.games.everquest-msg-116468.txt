The Grey (anything except the sun revenants), Maiden's Eye (Umbrous toilers
and the 'peon' gorangas only, everything else has either too many hp, is too
high level, or has a funky ability that will get you killed - eg Xi/Xin HT,
Coterie lifetap, and the Xi that don't HT do cast, they prefer to use cleric
nukes)
