I you ask me the illusion is broken the minute you step into a zone. I
mean when's the last time you went in to a forest and saw 30 odd
people running around killing things only for them to magically
reappear?

Instancing done well helps the feel you are in a world. I.e. you are
given a quest and only you (and your party) are in the zone and have
to complete it. The story can then unfold how it should.
