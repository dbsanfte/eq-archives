I've done everything I can to minimize moving my hand from the keyboard -
fortunately I play a DPS class and get my targets almost exclusively
through assist.

To the end of being able to move while either mousing or hotkeying I have
movement on WASD (although I see an argument for ESDF), my hotkeys on the
numpad, ctrl numpad to cast spells.  Interestingly enough, shift numpad#
sometimes works for switching banks, sometimes not.  I thought I'd gone in
and found all the collisions - but I must not have.  

One of the reasons I avoid the mouse so assiduously is because I find it
hard to track the cursor, or pick it up quickly if I don't know where I
left it.  I have 20/40 vision with my contacts in (-19.5 correction on
them) and have problems with standard cursors.  My windows cursor is an 
animated rotating pyramid, 4 sides alternating dark blue and white, set
of by a counter rotating soccer ball - alternating DB and white.  The
motion combined with the fact that it has high contrast against light
and dark backgrounds makes it very easy for me to pick out (unti I pass
into a word document and it turns into a hard to see I bar.)  I'd really
like to change the eq cursor, but haven't gotten to that yet.  If anyone
has a link to high contrast EQ cursors - I'd really appreciate a heads
up :)
