If the only thing you're concerned about moving out of the chat box is
your hits (because you have everything else turned off) then, yes,
there is a handy-dandy line that will do this, but without knowing
what screen resolution you play at and where you've moved your
windows, we can't tell you what it is :)

Perhaps if I give my line and explain the parameters, you can make
suitable modifications for your setup.

I play at 800 by 600 and have largely left the windows where they
appear by default, so:

/hitsmode my m3 0 320 7

will do what you want for my setup.  "My" is my hits (the other
possible parameters here are "me" for me getting hit and "other" for
others' hits).  m3 is just a mode to determine the verbosity of the
text and m3 works well.  0 is the x position (on a scale, for my
resolution, of 0 to 800, 0 being all the way to the left).  "320" is
the y position (0 to 600 for me, 0 being the top of the screen, so 320
is a bit more than halfway down).  And "7" is the maximum number of
lines that will be displayed (10 is the maximum allowable, I think).

You will probably have to play with this line a bit to get it to work
for you.  You can also change the fontsize of the text, if you want.
