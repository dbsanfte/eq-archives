It's really way too early to tell.  I know that a lot of old timers like 
myself have pretty much dumped EQ for WOW and EQ2 (EQ2 in my case, though I 
did like playing a cow druid in WOW :) ), but you have to factor in the Xmas 
season along with the newness of WOW, EQ2, Halo2.  Of course, another big 
factor is how long or how much you've gotten out of EQ.  After 5.5 
years...damnit, it's time to move on!  I've gotten burned out probably 6 
times in the last 18 months.  I can't be alone in this.

The newer players of EQ have so much left to get out of the game.  It's too 
early to tell if 1-2yr casual players are willing to give up on all that 
time they've invested in their characters (after 5+ years I'm willing and 
able but I wasn't at 4 years).

EQ still has a lot of advantages over EQ2.  For instance; I've yet to learn 
what the point is in reaching high levels in EQ2.  I'm sure there are 
plenty, but I haven't heard about it yet.  For that matter, I still haven't 
learned what the highest level is.... <g>  I have no idea what spells (if 
any) are available after level 19. I have nothing to look forward to for 
progression and I'm only at level 10 or 11 on my main.  I'm not bashing 
EQ2...I'm finally having a lot of fun gaming again (EQ2 did something EQ 
never really did...took the word "EverQuest" seriously), but as far as I can 
tell, the best thing you can say about content is "it's better than DAOC!" 
:p

And hello to you too. :)
