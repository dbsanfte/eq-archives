 Amen. That's really my biggest complaint about this dungeon. Other than
that it's laid out great and has nice loot (although most of the best
stuff is isolated to South wing). The xp is rather nice too.

 Usually they make it up and aggro a bunch of nasties on the other side
of the East door. Sometimes though, they fall down below. Which sucks if
you're doing the zone in since that's one less mob to kill. You can
either drop down and kill it, which could be a bad idea since the golem
now shared aggro with a lot of mobs, or petition and have it killed.
Most Guides I talked to didn't have a problem doing that. But yeah, the
best prevention is snare.
