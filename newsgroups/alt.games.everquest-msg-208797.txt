Ok, that sounds pretty sweet so far.

I like the idea of classless/levelless system, allows for lots of
customization of characters and depending on the route they take, you will
have a lot of variety.  EQ is great and all, but it does stink that
every character of the same class is essentially the same character.

SR> Magic
SR> ----------
SR>
SR> On this issue, I'm not yet sure which way to proceed. I'm in between
SR> the standard buy a scroll, save it in your book, and cast system. Or,
SR> create your own spell via a formula, and each component has a certain
SR> effect, and the components combined form the spell, and the skill
SR> level required to cast it (note that these formula components are only
SR> required to create, not cast, the skill. In other words, no lugging
SR> around of ingredients).
SR>
I like the idea of a create-your-own spell sort of thing, but I may
suggest a combination of the two.  You have a set of standard spells that
people with X skill can buy (a few offensive a few defensive).  Then you
also have component based spells for those that really want to get into
the research end of it.  And those component based spells, like you
mentioned, should be highly customizable, with different sizes (the bigger
the bolt, the less chance of missing), more powerful/less powerful,
perhaps a speed/casting time component on them as well. That can work kind
of like arrows in EQ do.

SR> Combat
SR> ------------
SR>
SR> In an attempt to make combat a little bit more interesting, I'm
SR> considering allowing the targeting of individual body components of a
SR> target. Certain components may have an attack penality, but may result
SR> in higher damage. Other than that, I can't really think of any ways to

SR> welcome.
SR>
This sounds very interesting, but I do not know how easy this will be to
implement, especially if fighting large groups of MoB's (too many body
parts flailing around).  Perhaps make areas targetable for "epic"
encounter mobs only.  This can still keep it interesting but not lose
functionality when fighting large groups.

SR> Tradeskills
SR> -----------------
SR>
SR> As I've mentioned above, with the skill system I have in mind, it'd be
SR> very possible to create a tradeskill only character that'd never even
SR> harm a fly, for those so inclined. Trade recipes, will be available
SR> via an in-game system, and higher more advanced recipes will be easily
SR> attainable without the guesswork. Please note however, this will only
SR> apply to the standard series of recipes, not special or quest related
SR> recipes. Those, will have to be obtained via other ways.
SR>
SR> I am not sure yet if I should allow creation of items w/out the
SR> character having the recipe for it. Either way has its pros/cons.
SR> Thoughts on this?
SR>
This idea is cool.  Again standard recipes are good, but customisation is
the key.  And I think a character should be able to create something
without a recipe, provided their skill level is sufficient.  This will
lead to people trying new things and making their own recipes, which they
can sell, further boosting the tradeskill market.

SR> Quests
SR> -----------
SR>
SR> One word: DYNAMIC.
SR>
YES! enough said!

SR> This is everything for now..I'm sure I forgot to mention 80% of it
SR> all. :) But it's a starting point...

This sounds very interesting and I would like to help out if you need it.
