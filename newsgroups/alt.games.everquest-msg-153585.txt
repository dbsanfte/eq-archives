Please take the following into consideration though -

The SA (for adds) was a 60 ROGUE.  (It was basically me, him, a puller monk,
couple of utility classes (from my guild), and a bunch of people from a
smaller guild, they were raiding HoT.. we wanted Doze, so we helped their
raid.. we pulled it, we tanked it, we gave them all the armour.  In return,
they agreed to move aside when we were ready for Doze (guild was killing
Zland and Kland beforehand))

So thats a rogue who effectively tanked HoT too.

Celaeno said on a wipeout, her guild had rangers as MA's in HoT, with no
problem.

Of course monks are the only ones with the problem though.. forgetting the
fact they take a massive beating when they pull mobs (hi Idol, hi AoW, hi
Tormax, hi ToV, hi anything not rooted in Luclin), forgetting rogues
outdamage monks, forgeting rangers have the potential to permanently
outdamage monks as well as utility spells, and spells not available anywhere
else (CoP: +ATK, CoE, SoN, FoN, track, snare, root, regen, HP buff)

I play a monk primarily, I do also play a 60 cleric extensively though, so I
see both sides of it.

In places such as Velks, Sebilis, HS etc, mobs damage output is WEAK.  Add
to the equation that monks can do better damage, yes they can be more
effective in some exp groups (not because they are taking less damage, but
because they are dishing out more, and the mobs dmg is too small to really
make a difference)

Remember monks lose damage when tanking because of stun (some warriors can't
be stunned from the front)

Anyway then we move up to tougher mobs... CT, Umbral, Ssra etc.. no way in
hell does a monk come close to a warrior for effectiveness in these places

Imho the only real problem with monks is at the very highest game, higher
than James' guild (not sure about Bens, I haven't seen his guild monkies
magelos), yes even tho they are killing the same mobs as FoH, the monks
aren't that far up there

Im talking the very top monks in a guild like FoH, not their monk team, but
maybe their top 3.  Well fuck me, thats what.. 0.000001% of the entire monk
base, let alone game base percentage

* Reason I used James as an example -  I've looked at magelos of his guildie
monks, and they are generally in the same HP range as my guild (of course I
could have missed the magelos of your top 5 monks if they never posted on
the boards), but seeing their HP, knowing my guilds HP (our monks average
5.6 to 6k raid buffed)  I know what monks of that level can withhold  (not
refering to regen, weapons, ATk, whatever else gear they have that would be
better than mine or any other guilds, just using the only thing that
matters - raw hp)

What well thought out ideas from Verant..
