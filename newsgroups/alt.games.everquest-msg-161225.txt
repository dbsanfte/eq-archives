}Appears that maybe you did a bit of creative rounding - 25 bucks

}barebones original EQ. From what I hear, the Gold version runs from
}$60 to $70. Not quite as bad as $90, but you then still have to pay
}the 12.95/mo to play.

The Best Buy here in Chicago, the sticker on the PoP box said 29.95, but it 
rang up as 24.95 at the register.  *shrug* I wasn't gonna complain. :)
