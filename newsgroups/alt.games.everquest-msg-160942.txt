Well, for starters, you're assuming that spilled innocent blood is the only 
form of misery.

Then there's the debatable points about whether atheism is or is not a 
religion, and whether all commies are godless.  If you're restricting your 
statement to only atheistic communists, that's probably a heck of a lot less 
misery.
