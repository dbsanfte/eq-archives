Just found a new item that gives off light, had a long name I'm
sure I'll mangle: Velikoshu's Crystal.  Drops off of miners in
the Crystal Caverns (high 20s to 30's zone in SOV) as a
no drop item, range slot +10 hp.  Just the thing for a barbarian
rogue with high level friends willing to port him to Iceclad, or
with a truely masochistic willingness to run across all of
antonica for a disposable trinket like this!  Since nothing in
your flight path will see invis, you can simply crawl across
a couple zones, then lurk down in the upper level while
people kill miners.  Ask to loot one of these things, I
highly doubt anyone will object, by this time most of them
will have found much better range slot items anyway.

Course now you have to sneak back to the coast and hunt
Snow Bunnies... or all the way back to Antonica.
