HAHA! Your post stuck in the back of my mind and when i was running
out of west freeport gates and i see a necro sitting on the ground and
his name was "Yourweak" i couldnt help myself. Hehehehe.....i ran up
to him and said "my what?" (i was playing a 34th druid at the time)
And lo and behold he gets up and says (........drumroll.......)    
Sow Please. I said what about my weak? He replied with a ?. Then i
said are you implying that I am weak? Then it would be Youreweak. he
said YOU R WEAK. I was almost crying with laughter. I cast sow on
myself and trot off out the gate.
