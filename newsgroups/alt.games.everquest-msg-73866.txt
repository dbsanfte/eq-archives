Just what am I supposed to be admitting Biz?  That I will soon be
assimilated (now theres a word I rarely use... and surely havent
spelled correctly) and will twink like everyone else?  

Dont get me wrong, on the point that probably a vast majority of those
who whine about twinking being jealous, you are likely correct.  As
evidenced by the number of people who shout in EC "Does anyone have
anything they can give me?"

So because others conform that means that all will?  I dont think so.
I have been playing nearly 16 months, and have decent armor and
weapons on my main, as well as having hit 32k in the bank a little
over a month ago.  I also have a 7th level Cleric alt who has not seen
one red cent of it and never will.  Why?  Because she can earn her own
money and has.  By level 5 she had managed to purchase a complete suit
of Banded, have all her spells for her level and still had 85pp left
in the bank.  She started just like my main did, with nothing, and
earned everything she has.  COULD I have given her a few things that
would have been nice?  Sure.  Could I have simply tossed a couple Kp
her way so she could buy some nice items?  Sure.  Did/Will I?  Never.
She doesnt even know Kharl exists, and Kharl doesnt know she exists.
Kharl is a merchant/fletcher/warrior who will likely have more money
than any of my alts.  Kharl could EASILY make life cake for her and
any others I started, but why should he?  He made the money, he worked
for it, he earned it.  They didnt.

Sorry, I make no distinction between twinking yourself or strangers or
friends.  My feelings are the same.  Whether you gave your own 5th
level monk an FBSS, a Stranger Monk and FBSS or a friends newbie monk
an FBSS, the fact is you still twinked someone with an FBSS.  WHO it
was is irrelevant to me.   

And why re-hash it out?  You are always welcome to let it pass, but
somehow I dont think you can do that.  I have seen you for too long.
