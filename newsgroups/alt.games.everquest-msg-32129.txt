Yeah, Lenka Stoutheart -- that would be my guess too.
She's not on the normal Freeport factions, I'm pretty
sure she's on WolvesOfTheNorth, the Halas warrior's faction,
so it's not surprising if she rips out after someone who
has been left alone by most of the rest of the Freeport
residents.

But she only spawns in the daytime, when night falls
she despawns and then Scar and his buddy handle the
night shift.

On the bright side, if you stand on the dock by
where the boat arrives and do *not* go wandering towards
the bar, Lenka should leave you alone (unless someone
trains her out, which is pretty rare).

I'm betting "Unholy Cow" was killing time waiting
for the boat, and decided to play "what's behind
door number one" at the Seafarer's Roost.  Lenka's
spot by the bar is very close to the door.

He said the female NPC killed him in "three hits",
which makes sense for Lenka, she's level 35, but
not for Olunea Miltin (the female NPC who hangs out
at the end of the docks), she's only level 8.
