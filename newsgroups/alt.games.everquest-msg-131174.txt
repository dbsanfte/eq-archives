The fact that the people don't TELL you they think its rude proves
nothing. Not everyone is going to snap at you for rudeness. They are
also too polite to be rude in return. I'd wager the majority of times,
"a_resting_player01" gives in just to get you the fuck out of his
face. The exact same reason (here we are again) telemarketters get
sales.

And you're assuming that a player who is sitting in, say, EC tunnel is
"resting" and not engaged in something else that isn't so obvious by
looking (/gu conversations, tradeskills, meditating, /tells, etc).
Very few people I've heard opinions from on the receiving end of this
issue DON'T say they feel its rude. Most of them do, however, say they
don't feel it's worth getting into an argument over. That doesn't make
it no longer rude, though.
