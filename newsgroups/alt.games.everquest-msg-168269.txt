He's got an arrogant style.  I happen to enjoy that, no big deal.  The fact
is, though, that there is substance to what he says.  Of course, I also
disagree with him alot, but the one thing I can never say is that he's out
and out lied, which isn't the case with many media personalities.

Actually, that seems to be exactly what he's saying, just not so bluntly.

Ahhh, I see.  The problem is, you have completely failed to have any idea
what the conservative movement is about.  Even a rudamentery knowledge would
rule out the possiblity of communism being called conservative.  Sorry, you
can't push those failed societies off on us.  Where are the free markets in
your "conservative" societies?  Where is the reward for initiative, and the
emphasis on individual responsiblity?  Communism is the left taken to it's
illogical end, just as much as anarchy would be the right taken it it's
illogical end.

Maybe we need to all define our terms.
