Problem is most of the people well known to the group contribute markedly at
keeping the STN ratio high in the first place.

For example, say a random dickweed, hmm, I guess I will do for the sake of
this exercise, posted the following no text subject line post:

"FUCK OFF LAMERS WHITE TRASH SUCKS NIGGERS SPHINCTER VERANT BITES BLOW ME
BIZBEE"

We now have one noise item to contend with. Now add on all the "well known
to the group" replies offering free psychological advice, legal counsel,
spelling corrections and suggestions of exotic ways I could go fuck
myself.....

Ummn - exactly how does help improve the signal to noise ratio again? To me
Dan's comment were an admission that not only is he aware of the inbred
nature of the group but is actually quite proud of it. Pride in
ignorance.... such an admirable trait.
