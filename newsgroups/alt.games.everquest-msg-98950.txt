finding a good group is, and allways will be a problem! Maybe i would
suggest banding in a small group 2-3 people, and try and lead the group
yourself. I've had very similar problems myself, and there is nothing you
can do about people looting mid-fight, also with pulling groups the group
may get split up slighty anyway, so loot as you go (If you can take the hits
:)).
