Spell Casting Reinforcement -- well, I wouldn't do it.  You have 36 aa points
worth of defensive abilities pre-PoP, 12 of channeling, and 12 of mental
clarity, 12 points of Healing Gift,  all of them more valuable than SCM,  IMO.
After PoP you have a lot of good stuff.  Actually, I would rather improve base
stamina than put points into SCR.

HP, mana, casting speed.
