Be careful, that's not absolutely true. Other programs popping up can,
and do, minimize eq. And at least with Win 98, I haven't found a way to
remaximize it, so I have to kill the program and restart to get back in.
I use Netscape Instant messenger (formerly AOL Instant Messenger) and if
I don't remember to shut it down before starting EQ, the first time one
of my "buddies" sends me an IM, I'm shut down. Last time it happened was
in the middle of a rather nasty fight. To say the least, I was a bit put
off.
