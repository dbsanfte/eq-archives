Try tigerraptors in WL near the SS zone.

Also, the mammoths and rhinos in EW. Easy to drag them to the
zone edge and kite. If you feel like a challenge do the Snow Griffs. =)

You could try the hoppers and cheetahs in Scarlet desert but
its hard to find a spot to fear kite. Maybe the ramp to the mesa.
