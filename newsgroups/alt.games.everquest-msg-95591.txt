Simple, if one of your chars is still ingame and has a status of LD check
the connecting ip, if that's similar to the current char's let you take
control over it. This combined with "LD-pose" of a bit longer then now (like
1 minute or so) will let you go on where you were, without pet-loss,
group-disconnect, etc.

The prolonged LD-time ingame might be a small inconvinience, but I'm pretty
sure people can live with that if they can reconnect a lot faster after a
LD. Sure you're vulnerable while connecting back in, but make you go to a
safespot if you're killed after re-applied and loading back in.

This won't protect you from pulling the plug fast when about to die but will
give you reduced relog time and inconvinience after a LD. Typing /quit and
relogging fast might give you reduced exposure to death (because of the "go
to safespot after re-apply"), but that depends on your pc and connection and
I doubt it's often faster then the normal LD-timer.
