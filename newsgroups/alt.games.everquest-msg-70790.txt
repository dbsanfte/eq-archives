What game are you playing ?
Rangers get the ensnare spell at level 51 and after that they are much
better at snaring simply because they can handle aggro much better than a
druid.

Rangers can take hits until the main tank gets back on top of aggro list and
have the (cinder)jolt spell to reduce aggro which should be cast right after
the mob hits you to prevent interruption.  If he runs out of mana he can
usually just take a step back until he gets lower on the aggro list.

Depending on situation and how aggro is shared the ranger can snare early or
late.

If you are grouped with a person that gets much more aggro then you (higher
level tank that causes more damage) or there is a high risk of trains etc
you can snare early, this can however lead to having to use the jolt spell
to avoid tapping the clerics mana - bad if you don't have enchanter/clarity
in group because you will soon run out of mana after snares/jolts since you
keep a standing position and don't meditate to well that way.

You are one of the first I have seen that seem to believe that Rangers are
worse group players than druids.

Generally people say the opposite because many druids keep soloing from 1 to
50 in a way that rangers couldn't, at least before they got the panic animal
spell.

I met many druids that know less of the lines of spells they have than me
but I have never met a ranger that can't use snare.

It's almost as bad as an enchanter that do not use clarity.

PS  One thing I have seen many times though is pallys that do not cast their
buffs or use their healing mana even when clerics are low on mana.  =)
