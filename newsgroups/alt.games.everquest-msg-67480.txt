    Depends strongly on the person and the specific model. I've heard a lot
of flack over the male high elf druid-armour look, and one bard posted a
picture of himself in Lambent that made him look like a dead ringer for The
Tick. I'm STRONGLY annoyed at what's been done to dwarf female beards,
otherwise pleased to delighted with the looks, and disappointed with the
animations.

    I know that some of the animations I'm seeing (or not seeing) are due to
my present computer setup - for example, I cannot see any /dance animations
on new models, even though I've been told they exist. But the ones I can
see, and verify that I'm seeing all of it with people on better computers,
are pretty bare-bones. As a specific example: the monk flying kick looks
silly. For those in the Pacific Northwest, it reminds me of Billy Quan.
