man have i had ups and downs in real life lately. i wont cry about it
but i  havent had a chance to do a lot on the net recently. last year
i finally got my enchanter to 65th level. the hard thing was getting a
decent guild or surviving idiot pickup groups. i have 2 accounts on
the luclin server and recently only played twinks or group 2
characters together. the loneliness really sunk in and i missed the
old groups of people i used to adventure with. i long for the days
when exploring the world of eq was new. ive tried other online games
and here i am out of town on business on a lap top finding myself
wanting something to do. you know what....im gonna go get another copy
of evolutions and install it on my laptop and go run around in rathe
mountains, go chase some spectres, level a noob at orc 1 in east
commons or just work on tailoring.  :)
