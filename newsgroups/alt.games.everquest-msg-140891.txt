I would agree with that, but it is a damn convenient place to solo.  And I
did state that it's not all monks, but a few tend to ruin it for others in
their class.  Would I not group with a monk in the future?  Of course I
will.  I will of course have to be selective.  I have a personal "do not
group with" list that seems to be growing.  I've only been playing just
under a year and have seen people make comments about summer bringing all
the kids into EQ.  I thought that was just pessimism at first, but now I
realize they weren't kidding!
