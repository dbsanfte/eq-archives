air pet spell is:

water pet spell is:
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1021&source=Live

A rough estimate (that doesn't take into account partial resists)
based on the data in that post says that water's proc added5 DPS
and Air's proc added 3DPS.  However, another post in the thread about
pet defense (the one that compared armored vs. un-armored pets)
tells us that Air's proc yields nearly a 20% reduction in number of
attacks in a time period.  Given that WoX's proc lands on mobs in
BoT and HoH, this is a fairly useful tidbit :)
