First bit of good advice yet.  Thank you, Red.
Instead of a psychiatrist, I have abandoned the game.  I think in time I'll
be just fine.  I did want to vent, you were right.
The negative responses I simply ignore.  I've gotten so many of them in
life, what's a few more?

And concerning how you say I stalked her...At NO time did she simply tell me
to get fucked and go away.  She most likely felt that would be like such a
meanie weanie, lol, and she's just "not that kind of person".  She told me
that about herself many times in the time I knew her.  But it is no better
to leave someone hanging...I proposed she tell me to get the hell away or
tell me what she wanted.  She did neither, so I finished it.  Granted, I'm
not too proud of getting to her through her husband, but who's to say he
believed me anyway?  Who's to say he cared?  It just made me feel better,
and dammit, I think I deserved that much after all that crap.

I wanted an ending, and maybe I got just that.  It was a helluva lot better
than wandering around, being led by the nose, wondering wtf was going on.
