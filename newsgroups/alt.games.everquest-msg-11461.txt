I thought it was an M-16, but on further research it appears it was a AR-15,
which seems to be some variant of the same rifle. I must admit I didn't know
that "assault rifle" is synonymous with "fully automatic rifle". I do not
pretend to be a gun expert.

Sergeant Gerard Dutton, Ballistics Section, Hobart Tasmania Police;
Dr. Tim Lyons, MB ChB, FRCS(Ed), MRCPath, DMJ(Path), FRPCA(Forensic);
Director of Forensic Pathology, Tasmania;
Sergeant Shaun Roach, Forensic Ballistics Section, Sydney, NSW Police;
Sergeant John Dickinson, Forensic Ballistics Section, Sydney, NSW Police.

You could try those.

You really have to wonder why the military use similar weapons. Perhaps they
should issue revolvers to Marines instead of the standard weapons, after all
they are just as effective.

Believe it or not, I am not in favour of any radical gun control in the US,
(well, maybe siege mortars), because I don't think it would accomplish much.

I really can't see why anyone feels the need to own an AR-15, but if a
country decides that is the way to go, so be it. To say that they are no
more dangerous than a revolver is ludicrous.

The flaw with this thinking, is that people don't drive their Ford Explorers
into schoolyards and massacre children, do they?  Everyone knows what
schoolyard killers take to school with them.

"Mr Bryant often experiences fear and a sense of inadequacy when confronted
by other people. In part he compensated for this sense of weakness through a
fascination with weapons and through the possession of weapons. With his
ready money came access to weapons of enormous potential power for
destruction. The obsessive concern with weapons and the exhilariation he
attained from handling and using guns added yet another element to the
tragic mix."

The above is from the psychiatrist that examined him. The link to the full
text is here;

Martin Bryant had access to cars, revolvers, lever action and bolt action
rifles, yet what did he choose to kill with on that day.
