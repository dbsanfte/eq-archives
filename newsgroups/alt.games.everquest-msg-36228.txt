Having fought there with a couple of KOS characters, you don't really even need
invis or sow.  Just when you head to the newbie gardens, stay in the middle of
hallway area and don't stop at all until past the guards.  Only one time did I
ever agro any of the heretics (i got too close to the wall, cause i was on
autorun talking on the phone), and I never aggroed the guards.  If you do aggro
the heretics or guards don't stop, just keep running to the warrens zone in and
then zone back out.
