Not the way I understand it.   The mob will smack the shit out of the first
person on the hate list.   He rampages at the next couple highest people on
the hate list.

On our raids, we are told that if we get rampaged, stop attack and do not
resume until you have been healed.  If you do this, you don't get rampaged
again until quite a while after you resume attacking.  If you do not do this,
you get rampaged two or three more times very quickly, and die to low health
aggro.  At no time during this do we move out of range, or at all.  I've seen
it work personally.
