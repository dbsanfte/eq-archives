I 2 box and use win98se on one machine, and winXP on the other.  Computers
are similiar specs, however my main which is currently a 1 Ghz AMD Duron
(with winxp) seems to lock up sometimes.  Not sure if it's related to XP or
AMD, I realize it isnt the best chip.  It rare I see a lockup, but otherwise
both have been stable for me.

If you want the best stability win2000 probably is the best bet =)
