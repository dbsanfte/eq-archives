They don't according to eqdiva either, well, unless they get it post 60.

OK, did a bit more digging, at level 61, they can get the Planar AAXP
ability Harmonious Attack, which gives them double attack.  So, technically,
they can indeed get double attack, eventually.  A bard can buy one rank of
it per level over 60, at the cost of 2 AA points each, increasing his chance
to double attack.
