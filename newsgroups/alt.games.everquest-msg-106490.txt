Let me pose a question.  How many people have you made friends with because
of an /ooc chat.  I know I have.  /ooc is a good way to get to know people
that you would otherwise not ever have a reason to talk to.  It starts off
as a simple question or statement in /ooc and you find something that
someone says interesting, or visa versa, and then you take it to /tell.  And
you find yourself talking to them the next time both of you are on and you
have a new EQ friend.
For me a zone chat is this, more then two or three people talking about a
topic that is non-offensive and where anybody in the zone can put in their
thoughts and opinions.  If all of this kind of stuff moved over to channels
it would limit meeting and getting to know new people.
Also more then once a zone chat has started up and I have learned something
that I did not know about the game.
So personally I won't give up having appropriate zone chats.  Really, if you
don't want to be bugged by it then you have the option of turning it off,
because if you do not like zone chats what are you really going to
miss----the idiot that is saying every 30 seconds to a minute Lv 19 warrior
lfg--or the ever popular---Could someone give me a SoW please.
