What is the difference in a Fine Steel weapon and any other weapon? 

Checking with the merchants I find that they charge 76pp for a Fine 
Steel Rapier and only 19pp for a plain Rapier, yet both do 5 damage 
while the Fine Steel rapier is 23 delay and the Rapier is 25 delay. Is 
the two points difference in delay really worth so much?

I am finding similar pricing differences between other Fine Steel 
weapons and their plainer counterparts.
