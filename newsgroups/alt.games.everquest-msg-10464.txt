I had never gotten an unsolicited rez before a week or so ago, when I got
two. One was simply from a cleric whom saw me make the silly choice of
dueling a dwarf in front of dwarven guards. He saw and rezzed me, no big
deal.

The other was odd, to me. I was hustling my druid through WC to meet up with
a regular play group my guild formed. We were getting ready to gather
ourselves when Kizdidean Gix (sp) jumped me and slaughtered me. I popped
back in GFay, where I was bound, and was waiting for a guildmate to arrive
for the port back. Suddenly, the rez box pops up. I clicked "yes," of course
... but never got the name of who did it, never got a message from them, and
never heard from my repeated /ooc shouts of thanks. Odd, and extremely
welcome.
