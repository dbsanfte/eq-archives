You have to be a shaman/druid/cleric in order to have the imbue <gem> spell 
at all.  Unless you squeezed in while anyone of those 3 classes could 
memorize the spells, you also have to worship the appropriate deity in 
order to memorize the spell.  You would be looking for a troll or Ogre 
shaman, assuming both can worship Rallos Zek, I don't honestly know off 
hand.  There are a few people out there, one in this newsgroup that I know 
of, that have all of the imbue spells memorized, and can cast them.
