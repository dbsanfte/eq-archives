Brought to you by the fine folks at The Glade:



SCENE: Rivendell. Elrond is studying. 

GANDALF: Ach! Damn it! 

ELROND: Gandalf! Where did you come from? ... You're naked. 

GANDALF: Stupid halflings who can't play their class, that's what
happened. 

ELROND: What? Where? 

GANDALF: Moria. We were in the safe hall at Balin's Tomb and Aragorn was
going to pull some orcs to clear the way to the zoneout. 

ELROND: Which halfling messed it up? Frodo? 

GANDALF: No, it was Pippin. I didn't even want to bring him along but
Frodo did
insist. Aragorn was going to pull some orcs but out comes Pippin to 'see
what
Aragorn was doing' and manages to aggro half the zone. 

ELROND: So you got wiped out by a horde of orcs? Yuck. 

GANDALF: Oh, no. They were green to most of us, so we cut through them
all
right. I was impressed by Legolas' bow crits. But then the Cave Troll
got aggroed.

ELROND: But there were nine of you, you could have handled the cave
troll. 

GANDALF: Oh, and we did. Except Frodo didn't know how to manage aggro
properly. The troll started beating on him. 

ELROND: Oh, no. Poor Frodo. 

GANDALF: No, actually, Frodo was fine. He had a mithril chain tunic on. 

ELROND: Jeez, just because he's friends with Bilbo, does Bilbo have to
twink him
like that? 

GANDALF: Yeah, no kidding. So the troll ran and Pippin of course forgets
to snare.

ELROND: Aragorn's a ranger, why didn't he snare? 

GANDALF: He was our main tank and was busy keeping the orcs aggroed on
him.
Pippin was just sleeping on the job. So the troll ran, and before we
finally cut him down, he chain aggroed the Balrog. 

ELROND: Oh, no. Stupid halfling dr00ds. 

GANDALF: Yeah. So naturally, I decided to take it on the chin. I told
everyone to run and I tried to hold off the Balrog by rooting him. 

ELROND: And he got you. 

GANDALF: No, actually, I had my shield up, and I just chain-nuked him. 

ELROND: You SOLOED the Balrog? Wow. 

GANDALF: Yeah, one hell of an XP hit too. But then when he fell, I
turned and
slipped off the ledge. I 10Ked when I hit the bottom of the Balrog pit.
Didn't even have chance to loot his corpse. And there went the XP from
the orcs, the troll, AND the Balrog. Stupid Verant. 

ELROND: Your corpse is in the bottom of the Balrog pit? 

GANDALF: Yeah. But no worries, I think I know a way to drag it out of
there. 

ELROND: That's good. 

GANDALF: So, can I bum a SoW off you for a CR? I want to get back there
before
the Balrog respawns. 

ELROND: This is Rivendell. We're high elves. The wood elves are in
Lothlorien. 

GANDALF: Nadgers. Which is where we were headed in the first place. Oh
well, I'm a wizard at least, and there's a portal not too far from
there. 

ELROND: Good luck on your CR. Why were you hanging out with those noobs
anyway? 

GANDALF: I promised Frodo I'd powerlevel him in exchange for him
completing the
Cracks of Doom quest with me. He has the quest piece - the One Ring. 

ELROND: That's NO DROP, isn't it. 

GANDALF: Yeah. 

ELROND: What do you get for completing that quest? 

GANDALF: Robe of the White and Staff of the White. Those would be
serious
upgrades to my Grey robe and staff. I've had this gear for way too many
levels
anyway. 

ELROND: Nice. 

GANDALF: Anyway, I'd better go. Do you think you could get someone to go
to the Moria zone to rez me once I get my corpse pulled there? 

ELROND: I'll try to find a guildie. 

GANDALF: Thanks.
