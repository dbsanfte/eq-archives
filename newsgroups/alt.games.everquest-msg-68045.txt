That's interesting.

The backstory is that the Katta folks are the Combine loyalists, who want to
get along with everybody, judge people on their merits and not what they
are, and sing kumbayah around the campfire.

But the Seru folks are fascists who broke from the Combine after they
started talks to admit Neriak to the combine.  They don't like anyone who
isn't like them.  Supposedly all the evil races are KOS there...
