I have to say that I honestly never allowed the thought of having to look
for a bind stop me from traveling all over Norrath.  I ran my barbarian
shaman over to Oasis before he could bind himself.  I have been playing my
warrior in Kunark, and my ranger for that matter.  OTOH, I have never had a
problem finding someone to bind me, there are generally plenty of people who
are willing to bind, sometimes for a fee, most of the time for free.  Worst
case, I have not been rebound, and if I die, I have a long CR.  It's
happened a few times, not many, but it certainly never deterred me from
going where I want to play.  I always bind anyone that asks, if they are
nearby when they ask.  I have not asked for anything in return for a bind
for 25 levels or more now, and I refuse anything that is offered.
