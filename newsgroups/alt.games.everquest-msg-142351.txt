Technically yes, but I doubt they'd ever allow the stats to get too high, I
mean what would a STR or INT of 65k do to the game? Talk about balancing
issues!

One way to limit uber-high attributes would be to add one extra byte that
each attribute would share. Each attribute would have a "high bit" that
would represent a place holder of 256, that would allow stats up to 511.
There would be 1 bit leftover (7 attriubutes = 7 bits, 8 bits to a byte)
that could be used for some other 255 capped attribute/stat, whatever.

No bout this would still require quite a bit of programming, but would
definitely make attributes have more realistic limits than 65k and allow for
some higher stats.
