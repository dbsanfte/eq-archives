I'm getting the general ffeling that the developers are sick of the
expansion already and want to move on.  I think they realise they made
a mistake, and as OoW is the finish up to what didn't go live with GoD
(L70, etc.), they'd just as soon move past it, put some stuff behind
them and get to work on something more interesting.

I feel for them.  They know they're between a rock and a hard place,
and they're going to have to struggle to keep their subscriber base in
the future.  The comment about focusing more on story-driven (eg
Velious-era) expansiosn in the future makes me hope they know what
needs to be done.

I'm not sold on GoD  though I may grab it when I'm in a position to
use it (eg hit 65), but I'm hoping the next expansion is more of a
"Lost Zones of Norrath" filling in the old places on the original
maps, or a "Underdark of Norrath" with dungeons connected throughout
the old world, and entrances either through the bottom of old dungeons
Ultima IV style, or in existig cities.  Or both.

Anyhoo, just my 2cp.
