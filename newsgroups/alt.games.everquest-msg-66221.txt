Actually, there is an overclocked Geforce 3 for sale with an Orb cooler on
it. Can't recall the company but the card is called the Oracle. Anyway, its
faster than the Ti-500. Not by much, but a little. The Ti-500 is just a
little faster than the standard G3. Most G3's can be overclocked to the
Ti-500 speed without problems if you have decent air flow in your case. Not
that anyone needs to OC their G3 yet ...

Anyway, G2's with 64Mb DDR are less than $140 now and I think they are
pretty much as good as a G3 for EQ. For anything right now really, since the
major feature, I believe, is programable Vertex Shaders that nobody yet
uses.

For an acceptable "value" board, the MX400 is tough to beat at $80.

Don't know anything about the ATI boards, but I read they are very fast
(Radeon 8500). Nvidia is setting the features standard, though, and most
games will be programming to their boards. This means you are likely to have
fewer problems and more supported features from the GeForce series.

In any case, make sure the board has at least 64Mb RAM, since the amount of
textures generated by new games keeps increasing.
