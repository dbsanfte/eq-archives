Because they are behind four classes that's sole purpose is to do
damage, and freakish amounts at that, doesn't make them useless.  A
mage with a pet can still do more damage over the course of a long
fight than probably even a wizard.

And that's not taking into account their utility abilities.

And yet, with their pet, they make the damage output of a druid look
anemic.  Druids have other uses though, as do mages.
