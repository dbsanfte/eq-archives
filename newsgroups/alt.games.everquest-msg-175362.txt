Why can't I be the antichrist? Obviously because I don't have a Bachelors
degree or higher, so I am a nobody in this world. I think I may go back to
school and study filmmaking again and make the most good-natured films ever
made with scenes of people reading the Bible and praying to God for strength
and guidance sprinkled throughout as much as possible, I guess because I am
an artist and artists tend to create art that bothers people and the thing
that would bother people the most right now is art that portrays the ideals
of fundamentalist Christianity in a positive light, so that is the kind of
movie I would make and probably will make to take up my time.
