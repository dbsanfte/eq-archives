Your maximum number will increase as you level - at 15, my max is 76
or so.

You can focus on fishing if you want, but you're better the raise the
rest, to, if you want to craft later on, as you need to be able to
have raw materials - you can buy the basic parts (tin bar, fossil
temper, etc) but this gets very costly very fast.

All my gathering skills are now 40+, with the exception of Trapping,
which is still in the mid-20's, hence regular trips back to Oakmyst to
try and raise it.

Once they're over 40, you can go to Antonica, where things are
plentiful (in the right areas).
