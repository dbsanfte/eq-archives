Does drop items off mob changes depending on ones lvl?  Once I collected 5
HQ Bear Hide in few hours from Kodiak when they were blue to me.  Now at lvl
39 Shammy, they are all green.  So I went farming.  But despite the ability
for me to mow them down I collected only 2 Hides!  Once I went farming for
Bat wing; it is needed for me to levitate.  I was taking the bat down left
and right, but ended up with just a few Bat wings.  When I was just starting
out I had tons of Bat wings from killing them.  It seems at higher lvl the
drop changes.
