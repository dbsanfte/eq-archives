I got this wrong,Ornate BP has clicky Spell haste and leggings has the
summoned hammer pet.
Clicky spell haste would be nice to have,but I wear the Ldon BP for
the cheap FT2 aug.
Even if there would be an item with a useful clicky like root,it would
be pretty unlikely that I had the armour slot open with all the Focus
gear,haste item,FT 15,and I would never give up my Cloak of greater
Pernicity for its 25 Strength.  =)
Oh,and I found a click item on my cleric,the leggings from Kael,100 hp
group heal,10 seconds cast time.  =)

Keep in mind,I do not raid with him,mostly doing Ldons,and stuff like
Veksar or Nadox in small groups,not to rarely needed as tank.
Although I could cry  when killing one of the Zeks with my 67 Ranger
on a raid and see the hammer rot.
