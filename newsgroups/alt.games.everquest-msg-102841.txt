	They don't.

	If you are an alcoholic, you are an alcoholic *for life*.  Just as if you
were addicted to heroin or coccaine.  You can learn to fight the addiction,
but you will struggle with it every day for the rest of your life.

|Why isn't there an over the counter or prescription patch

	Medical science hasn't developed one.

|Another thing to consider, if Alcohol is "majorly" addictive...  How come
|we don't have more shitfaced or majorly disabled people from alcohol abuse.

	Because alcoholism is probably the addiction most likely to be
successfully kept secret until it completely and irrevocably fucks over your
life.  And maybe past then, too, if family members co-operate.

|Personally, it is a matter of self control and common sense.  If we need to

	I agree that warning labels are silly.  Cigarettes say THIS WILL KILL YOU
on them and people smoke them anyway.  But your views on alcoholism can be
charitably characterised as "uninformed".
