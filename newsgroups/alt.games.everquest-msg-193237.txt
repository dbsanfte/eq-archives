Mage or Necro. Cleric can heal pets and buf pets
Mage - no need to shop for food/water + focus items and pets hit magic
creatures sooner because of weapons, rooting pet so can nuke etc.
Necro - fear kiting, FD splitting, gets root eventually (so does cleric),
would be nasty pair on undead

If you decided to restart, I would go SK for FD and tanking. I know you said
you did not want to start over, but 12 levels will go fast with a level 12
cleric healing etc. (at 8 go to PC and kill bugs)

If you want to be able to always have a group, start a shaman. Cleric +
Shaman is going to get you a group pretty fast everytime.
