No I didnt go on about it being mythical.  You are totally taking my words
out of context.  Take a reading course or something.  Here is the context
repeated for the hard of reading:

1. It was posted that there was an easily exploitable mob in GD but the name
was not remembered.
2.  I said it sounded like bs to me.
3. someone posted a link that corroborated it.
4.  I went to GD, found BLOODMAW, and found it to be true
5.  Someone else mentioned that I could have gone to see in GD for myself
before calling bs.
6. I explained that I hadnt looked "at that point that I had called bs"
because at that point no one had put forth a NAME and for all I knew it was
mythical and would not waste my time looking high and low (3 caves with
plenty of hiding places) for a usenet rumor about an un-nerfed exploit.

If you cant discuss things honestly and not twist the context then forget
it.
