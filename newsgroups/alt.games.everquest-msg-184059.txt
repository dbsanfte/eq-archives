Here's Scott's signature from the original message in this thread:

    M. Scott Adams (Not Dilbert, Adventure!)
    http://www.msadams.com

You can find a biography and web-playable versions of many of his early
games on his web site.

I was never a big fan of the Scott Adams Adventures, preferring the
Infocom games, which started to be released shortly after Scott's first
games, if I remember correctly.

Nevertheless, the guy has earned a prominent place in the history of
personal computer gaming.
