Godwin! (Godwin's law: basically, the first person to mention Hitler of
Nazis automatically loses the argument...)

Actually I don't think that applies here. But I had to say it. :-)

So that would make you a "developers must be perfect" nazi?

Unfortunately doesn't really work.

- Developers come up with an idea
- They think of 531 ways that it could be abused and compensate for them.
- Idea is introduced to the game.
- Some smart player comes up with method number 532, which completely
  trivialises all previous content.

The developers can either fix the problem (which is anathema to you) or do
something to fix #532. So far the EQ developers have chosen to fix their
errors. I'm sorta glad they've done so. If every cleric had a manastone
that worked in all zones (for example) it would change the game balance in
some fairly fundamental ways.

The game is too complex for the developers to be expected to get everything
100% right every time.
