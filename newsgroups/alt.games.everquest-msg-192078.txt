I have a 30 Bard and although I spend most my time on luclin (or I have up
until now at least) I have a few suggestions.

1) You can Chant kite giants in RM for good money.
 This is NOT fast, its going to take a good 5-10 minutes per kill, but it
all seems worth it when you end up with a giant dropping 47pp a FS weapon
and a lambent stone.
The exp is kinda slow, but who needs exp when your stinking rich.

2) Either Chant, charm, or fear kite Giant skellies and/or clops in RM.
 Much better exp, but sadly the loots not up to much, and they die fast too.

3) Join a group in Splitpaw.
 I've never found the exp that good grouped, but some people swear by it.
The groups in Paw love bards I've found, with CC, mana regen, haste and lots
of other goodies you have a great chance of getting a group.


I hope that helps ...
