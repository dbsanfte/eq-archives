There are a lot of factors at work here.

1) vendors are generally a ripoff.  They buy low and sell high.  If you 
have something to sell that's desirable, you can get a lot more for it 
selling it to other players than selling it to a vendor.  As an example, 
someone got 19pp from you for a weapon that the vendors only pay 4pp 
for.  If you tried to buy that weapon back from the vendor he would 
probably charge you 80pp or more.

If that's the correct spread, then any price between 4pp and 80pp would 
be a bargain both for the seller (who'd get more than 4pp) and the buyer 
(who'd pay less than 80pp).

If an item is relatively rare and in demand, though, it will probably 
never be sold to a vendor, and will be priced by players at much higher 
than the vendor would sell back for

I suspect the lesson you learned was "don't buy from players they are a 
ripoff" when the lesson you -should- have learned was "don't sell to 
vendors, they are a ripoff".  What stopped you from putting the weapon 
back on the market at 19pp... or even at 80pp, still apparantly less 
than what everyone else was asking?

2) At level one you were killing mobs that generally dropped things 
worth a few coppers, or a silver or two.  Ten levels later, you are 
killing mobs that drop a few gold or even a platinum or two.  A platinum 
piece is worth 1000 copper pieces.  Is it unreasonable to extrapolate 
that at level 50 you'd be getting loot off mobs thats worth 1000 pp?

The sad fact is that -less- cash is available than you'd think, its a 
rare mob that drops more than 15pp, and those are generally pursued as a 
"cash camp"

In addition to this, there -are- certain items that are generally sold 
to vendors, common enough that nobody will pay more for them; vendors 
set a baseline price and items generally don't drop below that in value, 
except in some instances where someone is ignorant of what vendors will 
pay, and get involved in a price war.

Thus one traditional cash camp is Hill Giants in Rathe Mountains, where 
giants drop a combination of cash and Fine Steel weapons (vendor fodder 
worth around 5pp each) to average about 20pp per kill.  Killing one a 
minute would then yeild 1200 pp an hour, and as you level up you can 
kill more than one per minute if you work at it (killing the lizardmen 
etc that are placeholder so more pop)

Splendid
