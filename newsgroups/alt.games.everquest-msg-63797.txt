LOL! My very first Vox raid, I was grouped up with a monk (among others)
who just said "Follow me. There's a secret passage you have to go
through to get to vox."
He ran straight into that damned pit, and I followed him. Somehow,
almost everything in the pit aggroed on him instantly, and I bravely ran
away looking for the exit. I found my way out of the pit with only one
mob aggro'd on me, found my way to Vox, started attacking her, and was
later killed off by the mob who was still attacking me. DOH!

Love those first dragon raid stories.
