As others have mentioned, the craig spiders (and the others too, I
guess) in EK are a healthy source of silk. But pound for pound, you'll
get the most silk from the Heart spiders in Upper Guk. Once, long, long
ago, I kept a list of all the loot from over one hundred spiders each of
a whole bunch of varieties. I published the results here, though damned
if I can find it today. The UGuk spiders won hands down as the most
average silk per kill. 

The worst? Those blasted swarming arachnids out on Erud's crossing.
Getting silk off them is like trying to get free condoms from the Pope.
