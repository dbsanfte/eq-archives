I would say it's more a matter of the differring moral codes of the
people involved in making/enforcing/obeying the laws are generally
in agreement on the subject of murder, at least in those cases where
they all define a particular homicidal act as murder.

Because, in the US anyway, a large enough fraction of the populace
is willing to go along with the assertion that not only is getting
high on marijuana immoral but it ought to be punished, which enables
those who crusade against the use of marijuana to get laws passed
criminalizing it.  Note how, in places where the population goes
along with similar views on alcohol the sale of alcohol is heavily
restricted or banned outright.  Note all the laws agains public
drunkenness and driving while intoxicated.  The reason for the
difference is that alcohol use has been an important part of our
culture for a very long time, while marijuana use is far less
universal and thus far more easily attacked in the legislative arena.

The difference between a criminal legal code and a moral code has
nothing to do with activities proscribed.  It has everything to do
with the prescription and imposition of penalties for violation of
the legal code by the sponsoring government.

The oft heard "you can't legislate morality" is demagoguery, but it's
far easier to say and remember than "you can't impose those particular
rules from your particular moral code and expect those of us who do not
include those rules in our moral code(s) to comply".  Since the target
audience understands what the demagogue is getting at, another false
statement enters the popular language, the common understanding of the
meaning of the word "moral" and its many deriviatives is confused, and
our communication is further complicated.  So it goes.
