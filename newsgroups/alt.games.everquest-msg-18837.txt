Okay, being a guy is easy.  Here are our three prime directives.

1) It's not cool to show your emotions.  Emotions are for weaklings and
women.  It is likewise with pain.  No guy will ever willingly let anyone see
him cry, and no guy will willingly express tender emotions.  This one is
easy in a game where that stuff is controlled by /emote.

2) Your ego is a precious thing and you must protect it.  You need some
bravado.  All guys badmouth one another.  The difference is that good guys
talk trash, and then good-naturedly forget about it.  Bad guys talk shit
(like trash except meaner) and they will follow through with it because they
are either too mean or too dumb not to take it seriously.  If your friend
talks smack to you, talk it right back with a big grin on your face.  If a
stranger talks smack to you, run away or punch him.  Have you ever seen a
nature program where two large male animals -- rams, walruses, or the
like -- fight by just ramming themselves together?  Men do that with words.

3) You want sex all the time.  It's a running joke that men are controlled
by Mr Happy, but it is half true.  Many animals use a system whereby the
biggest, toughest male drives all the others away, then he keeps all the
women and has sex with all of them as many times as he can.  Guys
subconsciously operate under a similar theory (see Rule #2, it covers
attempts to be the top dog).  The desire to attract and breed with as many
females as possible often interferes with proper thinking.  This is why guys
are such suckers for pretty women and become drooling morons in their
presence.  This would seem to be a violation of Rule #1, but we're not
thinking clearly enough to follow it at the time.


There would be a fourth rule, "Be good to women" but given the alarming
occurrence of rape, assault, and so on, virtually all against women, I guess
it doesn't apply to a large enough portion of the male populace.
