It's not for escape purposes.  Succor or Egress doesn't work very well
anyways when you're sitting on the succor point next to 3 angry things (for
where I hunt; Akheva, SG, DN, ToFS (when bored) and HS, the zone line is
closer or easier to get to in 4/5 than a 5 second egress when the shit goes
down.)

Yeah, I'm wierd.  I solo in dungeons.  Thus, run3 would be useful in most
situations.  I still haven't made the time to go back to Chardok though, and
I'm too afraid to try Acrylia Caverns.
