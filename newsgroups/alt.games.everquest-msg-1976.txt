 Forgive me but I don't understand how Verant would profit from keeping
it's customers online longer since they don't charge by the minute or
hour. What would happen if everybody stayed online the maximum amount
possible? Verant would have to triple or quadruple (if not more) the size 
of their server farms to handle the load. Why would they possibly want
to do this?
