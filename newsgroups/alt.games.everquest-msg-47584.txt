I'd go for an Iksar monk, forget the twinking save your cash and do the
Curscale armour and shackle quests. Up to about level 20 you'll find you'll
be able to play the role quite well with just these pieces of equipment and
maybe a cheap old 1hb and 2hb to buff the skill up. After level 20 then
twink like mad because you'll never be able to group well with others who
are twinked as they'll outclass you too much. Secondly get a shammy partner,
you'll be an incredible team!
