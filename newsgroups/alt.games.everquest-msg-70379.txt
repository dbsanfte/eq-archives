DT (and Lokari's post following this) I agree totally with those points.
What I *disagree* with is lumping everyone with legitimate complaints
into the same boat, and laying the blame completely at the user's door.
People are more likely to make agressive/unreasonable posts if their
legitimate complaints are ridiculed as being their own stupid fault for
having substandard equipment, if they know full well that isn't the
problem. Of course, it's not excusable, but part of the blame for those
very posts, is down to people like you saying 'There is no problem -
it's your own fault'
