The most ironic part about this post is how everyone seems to be
sidestepping what he was talking about. Insults about his supposed
sexual proclivitity does not address his point. Videogames are a
complete waste of time but everyone here is in such a comatose state
they dont realize it. Music is much more rewarding imho.

What type of strat are you getting? I am thinking about selling my PS2
to trade my bc rich for an old american Strat.
