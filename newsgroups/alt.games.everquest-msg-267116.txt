Not really.  All the guards pull singly, and Kaavi herself is a fairly
straightforward fight.

Best bet is to team up with a warrior to get folks for that fight - do one
then the other while you're all there.  Any group that can do the girplan can
walk over Kaavi.  Then find a wizard with lots of friends and do both SG kills
on one raid.  You're on your own for the Greasy Clockwork and All-Seeing Eye,
though. 

One hint for the clockwork:  it's indifferent, blurrable, and regens
VERY slowly.  If you start losing people, everyone stop attacking and
chanter(s) memblur it.  Rez the fallen, med up, and it'll likely have regenned
10% or so wnen you're ready.

At least they're in WoS!  We have bunches of people in EQ2 and WoW beta,
instead of doing epics.  And people doing epics rather than organized
advancement raids...
