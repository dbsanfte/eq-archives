Nothing. You cancel billing and billing stops. You never really
"quit." 

At any time, you can use your login and password again, then it will
say you are not being billed and bring you to the screen to enter your
credit card again. 
If the game is still around in 5 years, you'll still be able to do
that then and your characters will be the same as you left them.

They only thought about deleting all characters under level 2, who
were unused for an entire month, once. They later even decided not to
do that. So they've never deleted them.

Here, I've edited some text of Elrond's speech to Arwen in the two
towers where he tries to convince her to not give up her grace to get
it on with Aragorn. This is essentially about your EQ characters:


If the SOE hard drives survive until the end of the world, your
character will also last that long.
Your character will never taste the bitterness of mortality. Whether
by erasure or the slow decay of
time, your character will never die.

Your character will never come to death, an image of the splendor of
mmorpgs in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world. On their
hard drives it will linger on in darkness and in doubt as nightfall in
winter that comes without a star. There it will dwell, bound to the
drive, under the fading trees until all the world is changed and the
long years of our lives are utterly spent.

Apologies to the LOTR two towers screenplay writers, as well as
Tolkien.
