Then he didn't do the most basic research to find out about the game,
because that alone would have shown that there was at least some
tradeskilling. Yes, I'm being an ass about someone being willfully
ignorant of a fact that's so readily available with just minimal work,
especially when they're making judgements about whatever the facts
relate to.

So, by the way, did you only read the first couple lines of my post to
find something you can be an ass about? I did continue later in the
post to mention that even doing any research at all about the game
would have told him it had tradeskilling.
