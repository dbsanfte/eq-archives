It is still by far the best aa I have ever gotten for the time spent. While
in aoe groups in acrylia early I was getting 5-8 AA every day about 1 aa an
hour.

In plane of earth or sol rho in a group I get about an aa every 1.5-2 hrs
grouped . Which oddly enough was about what I was making comand of druzzil
soloing in tactics before they nerfed the hell out of it.

A good aoe group could kill 80-90 mobs per set . Also contrary to what
martin is saying you only need one wizard, he alone has enough mana to kill
all the mobs , the rest is just support for him and since you have to wait
for respawn med time is not important . A magician is usefull for the pet to
kill the wayward mob , clerics are necessary for fast heals on the chanters,
you use 2 chanters so that every mob has to resist stun twice to do anything
otherwise you are limited to about 15-20 mobs instead of 80-90. What is
obvious though is that not many of you ever had a good aoe group :p 4
clerics and 2 chanters would work better than 3 wizards 2 chanters and a
cleric.
