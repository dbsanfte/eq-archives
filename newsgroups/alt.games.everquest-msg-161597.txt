The faster your raid kills, the less damage taken, the less mana healers and
nukers use

Get everybody buffed during a 10-15min buffing session at the start of the
raid whilst *nobody* is pulling.. then the only people who need buffs for
the next hour or so (vog is 40ish mins?) are people who died, and the odd
late comer

What I mean is, the fact it has 40% haste is not the reason it will/won't be
banked on a long term basis.  Sure its a nice addition, but when your
talking will it easily be replaced, the ATK is what prevents you from saying
yes (if you want haste, get Gods and have 41%haste plus 75? hp/mana)
