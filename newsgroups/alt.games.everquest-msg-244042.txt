I understood the /auction command *was* for selling stuff, hence calling 
it /auction ...

If people would use /auction in place of /ooc or /shout to sell things, 
then it would be a snap to filter out. IMHO /auction is also the 
category for those stupid casinos as well. This soltion would make 
everybody happy.

I /ignore anybody running casinos, and tend to filter out /ooc and 
/shout if i am hunting and not near a zoneline. I dont mind listening to 
someone trying to sell something, i have bought some great items fairly 
cheaply from people selling in non-bazaar zones=)
