You're speaking about several different classes of people as if they
were the very same group.  You list:

1.  The people who created the term "VAK".
2.  People who are (supposedly) "unable to fathom the
    concept that not every was outraged by the things which
    outraged them".
3.  People who are (supposedly) unable to "fathom the
    concept" that others could play the game and disagree
    with them.

I don't think it would be worth the effort it would take to
deconstruct the factions and sub-factions that inhabited the
public EQ forums, but suffice to say that contrary to your
apparent belief that they were all one big monolithic group
and all simultaneously "created" the term "VAK" *and*
held all of the beliefs that you ascribe to them, the
actual breakdown was far more complex than that.

I believe that you're drastically overstating your case
by lumping them all together in that artificial fashion.

Were there some people who couldn't grasp that others
could disagreed with them?  Certainly -- on BOTH sides.

But that doesn't refute the existence of people who
seemed oddly personally offended when criticisms were
made of the game or its creators.  I never had a problem
with people who disagreed with me, per se, but it
seemed almost pathological when someone would couch
their disagreement in terms of, "how dare you find
fault..."

For example, one time I mentioned, non-judgementally,
that Verant's PR could be improved if Absor (their
assigned customer-rep on the boards at the time) would
respond to some of the threads that he himself had
initiated (e.g., Absor had started some "let's talk
about what you players think should be done about 
issue X" threads, then never came back to comment, 
even in general, about the responses that had resulted).
I thought it would help the prevalent "shouting into a
well" feeling of futility that a lot of players had
if at least Absor could come back eventually and
make some sort of token "I'm still here" post, even
if he didn't have time to summarize his notes on
what he had read, or discuss the pros and cons of
the various suggestions.

Maybe it was a good suggestion, maybe it wasn't,
but rather than discuss its merits, one guy came
back with a bile-filled tirade which said in so
many words, "Absor is doing as good a job as he
can, how dare you criticize him for not having
enough time to respond to every single little
question you may have, you selfish whiner".

Oookay.

If that was the only post like that, it could
be written off as just one person with an
emotional problem.  But as you may well remember
from the official EQ boards, that sort of thing
was common enough that it seemed to be a widespread
syndrome (not to say that there weren't some similarly
pathological syndromes on the "complaints" side).

And whenever there's a behavior pattern common and
distinct enough that it's recognizable when it pops up 
again, it's handy to have a shorthand name to refer to it by.
And thus "VAK" was born -- not to dismiss people who
happen to disagree about the severity of problems in
the game (although admittedly it was sometimes misused
that way), but instead to have a way to refer to the
bizarrely offended defenders who took criticisms of
the game (and sometimes even simple suggestions for
improvements) in a weirdly personal manner.

...perhaps because practically everyone had a complaint at one
time or another, and thus "the majority" of *all* the posters
(and thus of course, also the majority of the "buffoons") could
be lumped into the "bash Verant side of things" if one
was inclined to do so.  But I'm not sure if that really
proves anything useful.
