Sorry to disappoint, but the pricing structure Sony has planned for EQ2 
is not only novel to the industry but guaranteed to drive profits 
through the roof.

Game software: Free
Monthly access: Free
Bitching: $5.00
Moaning: $5.00
Unsupported claims of evil corporations and their minions tormenting the 
players out of spite: $10.00
Claims of nerfing: $10.00
Class Envy: $10.00
"l337" label above your head: $20.00
"uber" label above your head: $50.00
single class unbalanced to get you to stfu: $100.00
whole game shot to hell to appease uber guilds in their quest for a game 
they can control: $2500.00

Sony stock has been climbing steadily on this news as experts calculate 
the income stream from this new pricing structure will likely outpace 
crack profits of the '90s.
