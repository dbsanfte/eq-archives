Had my first EQ-related dream in a while.  I, who never bought LDoN, was
on my first LDoN mission, although it was a bit of a larp-style thing in
this dream.  

When we got to the boss mob we were actually in a church, and a group of
about 10 of some Ladies Auxiliary Jogging Team came trotting through the
church, aggroed the boss mob, and proceeded to kill it.  The look of
delight and glee on their normally-genteel faces as they pummeled the
shyte out of the mob with their bare hands was rather...chilling.  My
group was extremely embarassed that not only were we KSed, but by a bunch
of jogging church ladies.

But at least someone served us all tea and cookies afterwards. O.o

I've had EQ dreams before, but this was by far the most unsettling.
