okie... here goes...

There's a few different level based skill formula...

Monk Dual Wield is (level * SEVEN) + 7 (that's the only skill I know that
caps that high... a lvl 15 monk can have 142 max)

most other skills ARE the usual (level * 5) + 5

Priest melee is generally (level * 4) + 4

Caster melee is (level * 3) + 3

Fishing, Alchohol Tolerance and Begging are all level capped on the X5
formula...

Trade skills aren't level capped at all, but only ONE skill can exceed 200
(up to 250... called 'Grandmaster', but it doesn't show up as such when you
check your inv/skill screen)
