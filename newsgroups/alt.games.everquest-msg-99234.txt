Actually I think it is the first corpse run that is really going to
frustrate new players.  Especially since they may now travel further afield.
Before you might lose your corpse, but it was usually somewhere in the same
zone.  No telling where that corpse might end up now.  How many high level
players are going to stop what they are doing to help some newbie who died 4
or 5 zones away and all he can remember about it was "there were big trees".
Learning to create and use an LOC hotkey when you are in trouble will not be
high on the priority list for newbies who never had to worry about such
things.  I guess my point being that learning these things at lower levels
when you have a lot less to lose is not a bad thing.  For experienced
players starting new characters it will be a big help, but I think for new
newbies we will see a whole lot of yelling going on.
