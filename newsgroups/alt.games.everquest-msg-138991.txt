 True. I wore one until I got a Dain crown. Or the one from NToV that I
can't remember at the moment. While Iksars don't have it as bad as
humans, just about any class out there has crappy native see in the dark
abilities except Dark Elves which I think get innate UV. Maybe it's my
gamma, but Infravision is crap.  

>Forage.. not even relevant really

 For day to day things, no. However I have found it to be handy for
tradeskill type things. It's surprising how many veggies you actually
collect.

 It's nice to have, that's for sure. I don't think it's every really
saved me though. It is nice when you put on the fungi, get SP, get regen
and end up with ~50 regen a tick while standing. But humans get all
those as well other than the base rate. End game it's probably not a
large advantage but I'd say it probably is an advantage while leveling
up solo since it will lead to a little less downtime. More regen is
always a good thing.

 I break 1400 AC now while solo. Raid buffs get me up to 1480 or
something around there I'd guess. I also have a few upgrades to go to
replace those nagging sub-par items I've been dragging around since
Kunark. I'm not really worried about AC anymore since if there is a soft
cap I've exceeded it by now. Most of my next upgrades will be focusing
on HP than any other stat since those are maxxed out (with primal).
