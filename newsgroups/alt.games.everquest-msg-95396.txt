I'm still friends with a chanter that took the time to explain what mezz was
and how to assist.  Really made a difference in whether our party in unrest
ended up training or if we stayed and wooped skeleton butts.  I was still a
real newbie when I went there.   Most of the time, if they aren't assisting,
they don't know how.  Gotta rein in the tank and explain before he goes off
and attacks anything else.  Don't try to explain if they just keep pulling,
noone will be listening.  If they don't listen after talking to them then
put them on ignore and go find a new group.  Plenty of places to go.  By the
way, LOIO suxxors.  Stonebrunt is same level, and you can prolly solo there.
I got sick of LOIO idjits and made mega levels in stonebrunt.

Have Fun
