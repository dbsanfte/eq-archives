I just started EQ and I am afraid I will drive people crazy if I have to ask
what all these mob drops are for.  I've tried to check a few places and
found some quests then matched those items up but there are still tons more
I can't find.  Is there a website I can type in an item I loot from a mob
and have it return what quest (if any) it is used for?  Thanks for any help.
