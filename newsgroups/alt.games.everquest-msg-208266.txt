>what are the differences between /report and /petition ?

I believe... and I may be mistaken, but I don't think I am...  That a /report
sends not only your complaint, but 20 lines of chatbox dialogue with it.  

For example:

Idiot says: /ooc I'm going to train all the Pharty guys to B1 and I dare you to
stop me!

Then not only does idiot do this, but he spams the /ooc with taunts as well.

Scroll up to where the first /ooc is and do a /report this guy is purposely
training us in PC

The GM will get not only your complaint, but visual evidence.

With a /petition you just tell the GM what the problem is.

I hope that made sense...
