How about simply knowing when you should throw on another longer 
duration/lower mana cost DoT as opposed to a nuke to maximize your mana 
for the next mob, rather than DoT, nuke, nuke, nuke? You know, more than 
just mashing the highest damage button over and over without regard to 
mana efficiency.

See above.

Doesn't help a bard at all. :(

Right. They also need to learn mana management, which they are *much* 
less likely to do with KEI.

Anything not from the evocation or alteration schools of magic, 
basically. Why DoT and debuff when you can just nuke everything down and 
heal as necessary? The game gets reduced to damage spells, healing spells 
and melee.
