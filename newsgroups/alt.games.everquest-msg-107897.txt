From a merchant near or in your guild you can buy a regular staff (uncracked).  Stats are 6/28.
Cost is about 4pp.  You should also get a 2hb weapon too (great staff) and keep up that skill.
Cost is about the same.

When you get to about level 18 or so, you should be able to afford a fighting baton (1hb),
and a bamboo bo stick (2hb).  For hand-to-hand, ulaks are pretty good.  The polished
ones are best, but cost about 300pp minimum.  Don't bother with that yet unless you have
plat to burn.

My level 22 monk is using one fighting baton, and one bamboo bo stick.  He switches
off to keep all three skills maxed.

Check out allakhazam equipment sections for monks/1hb/2hb/and h2h

Whatever weapons you buy, make sure they are light weight.  The baton weighs only 2 stone
and the bo stick only 1.  Most blunt weapons are heavy unless they are MNK/BST only.
Weight is important because a heavy weapon will rapidly drain your stamina, and will decrease
the amount of loot you can carry before your AC starts dropping.

Good luck.
