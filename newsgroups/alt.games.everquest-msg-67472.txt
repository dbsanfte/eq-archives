I think you got that wrong. EQ is, at its core, just a database running
on a bunch of servers, and as such it can support any manner of clients
(Me, I'd love to see a rogue-like top-down text client :).

As far as I know, client-wise, SoL *is* Everquest 2, since the renderer
has been rewritten from scratch. As long as the client is updated
regularly, there may *never* need to be an EQ 2, and if I get the Verant
vibe correctly, that's their policy.
