Don't be so hasty, it's doable, with lots of care.  You can pull single
Umbrous Toilers, and you should be able to kill them.  I was able to solo
them at 50, barely.  At 51, it was easier, I have not tried since then.  I
did end up having to gate out to the zone a couple times, but I did manage.
Also, if you pick the Goranga carefully, you can solo some of them.  You do
have to be very careful though, adds are easy to come by, and there are a
number of mobs out there that you really will want to avoid.  I don't
recommend it as a good soloing spot, but, if you are looking for a specific
drop, like the charcoal off the Toilers, it is doable if you are careful.
