I just leveled my Necro from 24-28 in Marus Seru soloing and duoing.  The
exp has been very good.  It will be a little rough from 22-24 because at 24
you get some spells that are very helpful there.  So although it might be a
little boring, you might want to stay in Paludal a little longer.  The
upside of M Saru, is that you won't need a group there.  When you enter the
zone go left and stay against the wall until you get to another entrance.
This is Sanctus.  It is easier to pull singles here than at the Neth
entrance and you won't have to worry about the Zelniaks as much.  Start with
Greyhoppers.  At 24 I could solo 2 before I had to med up.

Things to be aware of here:
Zelniaks and Lightcrawlers will aggro-the guards will help you kill them

Greyhoppers, Stonegrabbers and Beetles will only aggro if you are fighting
another of their kind, so ALWAYS pull them as close to the entrance as you
can-guards will not help you kill these creatures.
