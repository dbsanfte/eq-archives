I'd agree with you that it should have run for me on day 1 but I can tell 
you it didn't, not acceptably to me at least. Of course that's a subjective 
call unless you would agree falling into single digit fps when turning in 
the world is not acceptable. I don't think single digit fps is ever 
acceptable myself. I read they had optimized it a lot and I did a trial 
recently only to find performance was still an issue more than I was willing 
to invest time fooling with. In other words, an out of the box default 
install did not cut the mustard so I uninstalled again. Maybe next PC I will 
revisit this again. For now having multiple EQ characters to play is plenty 
to keep me entertained.

As a point of reference, default settings installs of the new Crysis and 
Call of Duty 4 shooters looked good and played smoothly for me. Therefore, 
it's fair to assume Vanguard needs work as it should minimally do the same 
thing in my opinion. EverQuest 2 is a very nice looking game that will also 
do a default install that looks decent and plays smoothly. Vanguard does not 
do this even now after "optimizations" which are noticable but I give them 
no cigar for.
