The original quest, which gets you the spell and earring, takes the 9
tradeskilled things, cost me  approx. 4k pp, 5 stacks of silk swatches
(thanks DL lemming friend!), 1 stack of iron oxides (go noam vendors!) and
about 12 hours /played foraging and verbally berating an ebay druid IRL for
clearing all the WW animal spawns.

The new quest, which only gets you the spell, takes 3 vendor bought items,
costing 900-1k pp.
