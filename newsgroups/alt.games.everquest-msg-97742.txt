I am not sure how it works but it definately did work for me over the
weekend on test. I started a Halfling paladin and at level 5 did a run from
Misty to Qeynos and had to hide/sneak through Highhold Pass. I hid- then
sneaked, got the "you have moved so are no longer hidden" but noticed I was
moving at half speed which normally means the sneak is successful. I then
crawled from one end of HHP to the other - at some cases with red flamepaws
and regular gnolls walking over the top of me. Maybe I was just lucky : )
