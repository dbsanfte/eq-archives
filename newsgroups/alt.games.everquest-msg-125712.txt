Yah - that happens to me too lately. I am trying to ween myself off EQ and
back onto regular games but they don't hold my interest for more than a day
or two. I sit at the screen thinking what to play but often go into EQ from
habit and/or the feeling that nothing is actually accomplished in a single
player game.

Civ type games used to be my favorite followed by RPG's. I lost interest in
RPG's for a while with the all pervasiveness of the linear plot bioware
model, but some of the ones coming out now look to be better and more free
form.

I would rather sit down to a meal of puke patties than play another RTS
though, I am really burned out on those and have been for years.

Currently playing GTA 3, Morrowind and Shogun: Total War.
