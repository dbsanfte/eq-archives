 More power to them. They don't show up they don't get loot. Our guild
doesn't have a problem with this. So you lose the loot whores, big deal.
Better off without them. We very rarely do we have loot arguments
because most people know it's the fairest way.

 Rolling? I still maintain that's gimpy. I've been to 20 raids and
someone next to me has been on 2 in the past month. You're going to tell
me that rolling is fair? Hardly.
