Not quite the same thing, though. You can bind yourself or another
character past 50% so long as they are below 50% when you start
bandaging for one shot. My warrior can bandage forty some points per
bandage. When I see a newbie in EC sitting with barely any life and slap
a bandage on them, it's basically a Complete Heal for them, but if they
are at 51% health, I can't bandage them. (Or at least I couldn't before
I hit fifty. I dont' think I've tried since then.)

Monks definitely get the ability to bind past 50%, but not until after
they make level 50. (I'm sure I'll be corrected on this if I'm wrong,
it's been a while since I played my monk.) I suspect that we warriors
get it as well, but I haven't looked into it for a while.

I would suggest http://www.castersrealm.com/ if they are back up from
their server switch yet. Each of the class areas has a section for
special skills, and the bind wounds limits will be listed there for
each.
