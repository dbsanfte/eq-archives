Again the pointless totally miss the point!

Hey, don't send me a cent clown.  To ALL you mathematicians out there, suck
on this;
$.017 X 6hrs = $.102 X 450,000 "customers" = $45,900.00 worth of service
loss.
Send me that check and I'll include a sase!!!

You will never get it will you???????

Gezzzzz... why bother.  Don't forget to ask mom and dad next time you use
their credit card either!

Handle this; LET ME SEE...  9 yo with daddy's credit card = I don't care how
much it costs or what I get for what I pay!
