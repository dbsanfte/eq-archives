Dan Day accused Ingot of claiming the "sky was falling" every time
SOE made a change.

Knightsend commented, "Get over it."

Zarris told Ingot to "grow up".

Roger Bonzer suggested to Ingot that he should cry himself to sleep.

Khosh called Ignot's opinion assinine.

I only wanted to spend about 30 seconds on the project, so I only

     the people who said, "You don't see the wizards complaining."
