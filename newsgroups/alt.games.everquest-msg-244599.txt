From what I've read in this group, LDoN only uses multiples of five to
determine your party level.

If your party is composed of mostly high 40s and one or two low 50s, you
might get a L50 dungeon.  Or if the party is weighted more heavily towards
the low-mid 50s, you might get a L55 dungeon.

L50 and L55 are your only two choices.  There is no "template" for a L52
dungeon.

SOE could certainly add this capability, but that would require creating
lots of new monster data, as a previous poster said.
