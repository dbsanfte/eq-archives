No, I'm 100% positive that the Taliban, all of whom I'm sure you consider
to be "retards," are now plotting to stand in front of you in lines at Six
Flags,
thereby destroying your way of life.

President Bush's administration, however, is working with the Joint Chiefs
of Staff and the USA's NATO allies to thwart the Taliban's plans.   This
will,
however, require large numbers of ground forces at Six Flags, all of which
will be placed in line in front of you.
