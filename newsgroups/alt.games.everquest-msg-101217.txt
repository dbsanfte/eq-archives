I'm not arguing that we shouldnt have power, and I'm not arguing that it
should be non nuclear; I simply dont have the knowledge to make an informed
statement.

But, heres the next thought your statements throw up:

If nuclear power can be done safely but it takes a skill level of x, and
fossil fuel plants can be done safely but it takes a skill level of x/1000
and at their "safe" levels nuclear power would be better than fossil power,
which is better?

Or, alternatively, if both take "x" to do safely but the consequences
of an *unsafe* plant are "y" for the nuke, and "y/1000" for the
coal based plant, again, which is better?

The world is not a stable place; people fuck up, companies are
profit driven, etc. I remember the russian federation and most of
europe being incredibly worried about an ex soviet state saing it
was going to fire up a reactor that had been decommisioned while
still soviet because:

a) they needed power
and
b) their economy was fucked

It seemed to me the worry was not that it was an unsafe power source,
but that the *consequences* of it being unsafe were orders of
magnitude more severe than if it had been, for example, a coal based
plant.

nothing can ever go wrong at all, no sireee, oops, boom)
