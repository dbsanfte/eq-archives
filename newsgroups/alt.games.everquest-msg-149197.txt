Thats not a full rack, you can't keep a mob everstunned with just those
two.  As a cleric, I frequently load up Stun for interrupt... but not
Stun/Holy Might/Force/(whatever that fourth one is I hardly ever use)
since that eats up a metric ton of spell spaces.

Paladin casting  a stun causes no more than a tiny hiccup in his DPS.

Assuming for the sake of arguement a cleric with identicle DPS,
you'd see a significantly larger drop, since his melee delay resets.
Hybrids cast spells by pausing their melee output, healers and
pure casters reset instead.  With a long delay weapon, doing frequent
stunning, that actually adds up.

Now I'll grant you a cleric is probably doing less DPS via melee
than the paladin to begin with (if he's outdamaging the pally, its
due in part to his pet, which isn't interrupted by his casting), so
its no more than a "bonus," as I described it.
