You can right-click the vendors and they will give you a nice list of items.
Several will have a lot of scrolls. Right-click and hold to see at what
level you can use them. Buy (left-click to select, then click on the "buy"
button at the bottom of the list) all the ones you can use :)

They cost 1 gp a piece for level one IIRC so make sure you have enough cash
with you.
