Yes.  Although I guess it might be 150 or 200 (or more?) on the open market
though, I was buying from a shaman friend.   Either way the point is the
same.  The cost is huge compared to KEI.  And while KEI prices are based
only on what the market will bear, Shaman potions have minimum costs which
will always need to be recovered.

Hell, even buying from a guildmate/friend at cost, my 65 warrior couldn't
afford to keep DS potions up constantly on himself.  Only in raid situations
was it used...  correction, only in the "final fight" of a raid situation
was it used, it's too expensive for me to use them unless there is a
specific need.   Yet he seems to think every warrior twink comes with an
unlimited supply.   Maybe from the same place they all got thier
Fungi/CoF/MQ Velious armor/etc...

I didn't mention it cause that's way too much typing for what this argument
is worth. :P
