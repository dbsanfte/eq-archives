That depends on if you want to spend 29 bucks to be able to travel
nearly instantly to any city,  including the nexus, via a hub in the
plane of knowledge or something. Other than that, you really don't get
anything until you can enter the planes. VI says you can do other
things in the plane of knowledge like quests, but I'm betting they are
not worth doing really unless you can visit the planes.

Yes, it icreases the level limit to 65 overall. There is no limitation
of that to the POP areas only, you stay 65 with full skills and
spells.
