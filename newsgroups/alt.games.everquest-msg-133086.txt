Porting into GD and suffering a Disconnect on the way.
Relogging and having 2 of 3 characters fall for 10k dam and death.
Petition for CS Rez wait.
Wait
Wait
Log in druid (wasn't able to before as character hadn't disconnected
properly) fall to an expected death but at least I now have port ability.
Fuck the CS res I'll get a player one.
Collect Enchanter and SK head to GD
Corpses fell so hard they are apparently buried in the snow and
unretrievable.
Petition with Druid for Corpse retrieval and res.
Wait
Wait
Wait
So far over an hour has gone by since my first petition and I have no
intention of waiting anymore. Send a tell direct to GM in vain hope he might
be able to give me an eta, should I log now and try later (like tomorrow) He
couldn't or wouldn't tell me, hitting me with an auto response, oh well,
knew it was a shot in the dark anyway. Log, no point wasting another 15 mins
(all I really have left) when really I could expect to wait another hour.

Yes the little things, like the safe spot in GD is apparently a couple of
thousand feet above sea level <sigh>
I'd only logged on to say Hi to a couple of people and relocate to
Thurgardin. Do I feel let down by CS, not really, I know what to expect from
them, sometimes petitions are 10mins sometimes 2hrs I just didn't actually
have the time to wait 2hrs.

Gonna cost me a bit plat to get my corpses back now, I'd imagine, although
I'll guess I'll try the petition route again.
