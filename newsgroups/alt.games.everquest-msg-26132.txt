I'd say yes. I've only been to Velious once, for tourism spiced up by a
few horrible deaths, but it was worth it for the interface changes and
the new weapon/armor graphics. As for Kunark, you *really* need that one
if you are mid-level at least. The Lake of Ill Omen and the Overther
will expand your horizons like nothing else.

Besides, boarding the Maiden's Voyage for the first time is quite an
experience. Make sure you have the clipping plane all the way out. And
travel in the daytime. :)
