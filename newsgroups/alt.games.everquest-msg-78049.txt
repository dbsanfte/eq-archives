Ok, never been an evil race. Yeah, I'm only lv 2 as a necro, but I'm
thinking ahead.... I'm soooo used to Misty Thicket (that's where I run all
my gals to begin with, cause there's just so much going on there!) that I'm
kinda having a hard time with Nektoulos Forest. I KNOW that this has got to
be a different mindset, but it's giving me a hard time getting into it. Can
anyone give me some "rules" or... something... to get me into the right
frame of mind? Or if I'm not already, should I even be attempting an evil
race? I'd really like to get some xp as an evil race, after playing "good"
races for so long. I just don't know how to go about it. Anyone got any
hints? I'd appreciate anything anyone would like to send/post... any info,
help, suggestions, etc. Oh, and I really want to solo!

TIA

Darklet

Thanks for playing.
