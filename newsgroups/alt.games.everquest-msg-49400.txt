Servers are quite simple.
The zek servers are player-vs-player, Firiona Vie is roleplaying and the
rest is "basic" player-vs-environment. Pick what you think suits you the
best (I don't advice the roleplay server until you at least know the basics
of the gameplay).

The classes is a bit harder. All in all I would suggest to try a few and see
what you like best. As a rule you should try to get a character above lvl 10
so you get a feel for the class. Characters lvl 1 to 4 are almost all
similar, whatever class you use. Starting from lvl 8, 9 differences start
being apparent. Characters become real class-defining after lvl 20 usually,
but you don't have to go that far.

It's really what you think you will like. Do you want a big fat dumb ogre
warrior or more a sophisticated High Elf magician. Do you want to have a pet
tag along, jump in the fray yourself or nuke things from a distance. Do you
want to solo mostly or group up with people and fight things together?

If you're not sure about anything, just start a character on a random
non-zek server and play around. It's what we all did :)
