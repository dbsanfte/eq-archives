I belive the stand-down was postponed due to a response from Sony
stating that they will have a Questions and Answer / Chat in response
to the warriors outcry.  I think alot of warriors and monks will be
very happy to hear of the possible additons and eager to see what
comes of them...  (i.e. hopefully this isnt some crazy projection for
6 months from now)
