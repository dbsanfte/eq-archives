It's not really that bad if you have a few friends in your guild, which
I'd hope would be true for most people. I got 7 shards in about 5 days
with the rest taking me maybe another week after that. Maiden's Eye and
Fungus grove are probably the only real pain in the neck ones to get.
A lot can be easily soloed at the level most guilds wanting to go to VT
are now.

It's not killing the emporer that sucks, it's getting the damn ring to
get to him. Even with lots of friends willing to help even after they've
got theirs, getting the second floor ring? totem? is the most
obnoxiously boring camp I can remember. However, that was when the
experience was absolute crap past 60. Now they've lowered the blue range
again farming the Comm 2 camp at least might be decent experience

Our guild managed to key up 50 or so people in about 6 weeks of
dedicated work. Getting the stragglers keyed indeed took another few
months but that was more because the stragglers weren't on enough to get
their pieces in the first place. I'd say a lot of them were inspired to
put a bit more effort into it though once they saw the loot links in
guild chat while they sat in some experience camp somewhere.

Pop flagging

It depends on your server though. If there's already 5 or 6 guilds in
the elemental planes like on some servers you'll find the pickings
pretty slim unless you have a time zone advantage. Having the option of
also making runs through VT definately gives you more options for
gearing up your guild than going straight for the elemental planes. I
think the window of opportunity for guilds to bypass VT and still be
able to raid regularly and gear their people up has passed on most
servers by now.
