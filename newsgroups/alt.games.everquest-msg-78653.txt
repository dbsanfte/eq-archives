I farmed some belts this past Sunday at the Orc camp in WC and got 2 coifs 
with the 35 belts.  I gave the Coifs to a a guy who was lacking in 
equipment and made his day.  That was my act of good...

I only had 2 belts left to fill up my empty slots, and a DE SK comes along 
and I start typing him a message to tell him I am leaving after 2 more 
belts.  As soon as I start typing, an Orc pops and he jumps it.  Hmmm, ok, 
he didn't realize I was fighting here.  After he kills it, I tell him 
again I am leaving after 2 more belts and he is welcome to the whole camp 
at that time.  He ignores me and jumps the next orc.  Tsk tsk.  I then told 
him that we can share every other spawn, but his actions showed he 
apparently had no interest in that.

So, as they popped, I tashed them, and my pet whomped them.  He tried to KS 
them a few times, but always failed.  Then, he sits next to the campfire to 
get aggroed.  I got my last belt, he gets aggroed, and fights the Orc, 
chasing it way out of the camp.  I dump my pet, charm the next one, Rune 
III - Obscure - Aug it, /pet guard here on its spawn site ( he's still far 
from the camp ), mem blur it 2 times from afar, and take off to get my port 
at the Wiz spires.  After I'm out of sight, I invis.  That was my act of 
evil...

It doesn't both me to share, even if it was my "camp".  I prefer not to, 
but don't mind in that situation, since he may have gotten EXP from them, 
although I don't know if he could have handled the whole camp.  But, don't 
ignore someone when they try to be nice to you.  BadThings(tm) happen.
