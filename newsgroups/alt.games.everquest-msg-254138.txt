I guess they took out the decreasing timers as you level.   Sounds like you
have the same re-use as my 65 warrior.

In any event, the defensive disciplines are  Evasive, Defensive, Furious and
Fortitude.

Evasive and Defensive are very similar, and you are correct in how they
work.   Both last for 3 mintues, with a relatively short (7 / 10 minute)
recharge time.   With Evasive on, for three minutes you are much more likely
to have incoming blows miss you completely, however you are much more likely
to miss your target while it is on.   With Defensive on, for three minutes
all hits that land on you will land for less damage, but at the same time
your hits will land for less than full damage.   The incoming damage
reduction on Defensive is generally about 30 percent, and Evasive is likely
about the same.   As for which is better... they're both pretty close.
There are various mobs which Evasive works on more efficently due to how the
damage formula calculates, (Steel Warriors has or used to have a list) but
for the most part Defensive is generally the superior discipline.

Furious and Fortitude are similar to each other, but different from the
previous.  They stop you from taking damage altogether for 12 seconds with a
40 minute recharge time, Furious by making you riposte all hits, Fortitude
by making all hits land for no damage.  The advantage of Furious is that
(especially with a big 2 handed weapon) 12 seconds of hits on everything
attacking you can be a very significant amount of damage.   The only
advantage Fortitude has is that it will block attacks coming at you from
behind as well as the front + sides.  Neither blocks spells.  The DPS boost
is almost always far superior in this case.   I think I've used Fortitude a
whole one time in three years.


Furious / Fortitude are on a different timer from Evasive / Defensive, so
these days you can use them one after another instead of having to choose.
