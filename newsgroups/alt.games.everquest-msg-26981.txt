Little full of ourselves, aren't we? Whatever incident you're referring to, who the fuck
could pick out one time from the countless others where you made some idiotic insulting
comment to anyone?  Sorry if you thought I was part of your fan club that follows your
every post with drooling anticipation.  If you had two brain cells to rub together,
you'd see that in the last twentyfour hours, I've responded to several other threads
with your posts, where I actually (*gasp*) agreed with you and added to the thread.
  I don't hold grudges on usenet, moron. Neither you, nor I, nor anybody else here is
important enough to consume that much of one person's attention. When you participate in
threads that I'm interested in, and I agree with you or have something postive to add, I
respond appropriately.  But unlike any member of your fan club, when you pull your
typical "I can be an asshole all I want because I'm anonymous on the web" bullshit and
direct it towards me, I'll call you on it.
  Deal with it, Bubba, and move on.
