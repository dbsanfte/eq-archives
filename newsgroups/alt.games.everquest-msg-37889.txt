If the rumor is true, then I will miss having that info available.

I have characters on several different servers, and I use that info for
various reasons......
--probability of finding someone I know on a particular server (lower
population at a given moment, less likely to find someone on my /who all
friend list).
--Do I want to group or auction?  Then I look for higher populations.  Do I
want to solo, experiment with a new class, or explore?  I look for which
ever server might have the lower populations at a given moment.
--guessing the probability of being able to safely travel through enemy
territory on PvP servers.
--(as others mentioned)--indicators of whether any connection problems are
mine, or Verant's.  (lately, it's been 85% my ISP's fault.)
--I enjoy looking at demographics.... an example is watching Sullon Zek's
population change, and feeling the minor shifts in the teams' power base as
the kiddies go back to school....

It won't totally destroy my game if they really do remove the server
population info, but it will have an impact (albeit a minor one) on my
enjoyment of the game.  And I definitely will miss it.
