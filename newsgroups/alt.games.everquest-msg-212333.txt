Yeah, there is a huge flaw in the "God created homosexuals so it
degrades god's work." So, is pedophilia okay then? If people are
"born" homosexuals, why don't you think they are born pedophiles?
Is everything truely perfectly okay as long as it is with anyone of
the age of consent?

Yeah the entire "nature" arguement falls flat in the face of the other
perversions of preference. Just recognize that it is statistically
abnormal, possibly there are even fewer homosexuals than pedophiles.
Homsexuality is not "natural." By definition it is against the natural
order, therefore it is unnatural. There is no reason of nature for it
to happen, in fact it is counter productive. It is as unatural as
pedophilia. It is fully and totally selfish, with no good for society
coming from it.
