I'm trying to create a new account but keep getting Error 1001:
You are unable to login to the EverQuest Server at this time.
Please try again later.

I'm trying to connect over the uni network, I've added the server
IP addresses from
everquest.station.sony.com/support/connection/firewall_proxy_information.jsp
to my "Don't use proxy" list, and when that didn't work I switched
off the proxy use, also to no avail.

It downloads the patches fine so I'm at a loss what to do next.
Any suggestions? I'm running Windows ME.

Cheers,
Matt
