How much longer can it possibly take anyone to type "please" instead of
"plz"?  I don't understand why it's so difficult to type normal English
sentences.  What is so challenging about it?  I don't know about you, but I
type nearly as fast as I normally speak, plenty fast enough to never have a
problem "communicating a complicated thought."  The only explanation I can
find for stupid abbreviations is sheer laziness.  Not only does using them
make you appear lazy but dumb as well, and I can't help thinking that people
are one or the other when they come up to me and say "can u sow plz thx".
