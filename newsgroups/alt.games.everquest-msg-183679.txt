Ah, yes, of course.  I'm sure that was the issue.

We re-did Keeper of Sorrows last night, and the raid leaders were doing just
about exactly that.  Not that it was really necessary - everyone still had

I want to get more XP groups going there, because I think quiet = good.  But
the XP isn't as fast as a good group in the Arena in Tactics or in BoT, so
people are reluctant so far.  I'm hoping to use the lure of the good drops
from the nameds to get them to go.  =)

Thanks for the feedback, James.  =)
