I heard most of my forages were snacks and checked - roots, rabbits,
fruit and berries are all meals. The only regular forage to be listed
as a snack is vegetables, which I don't eat (brewing) anyway.

And the oddity was more prepatch - why make food/drink when you get it
for free?

*grin* I've been skilling up on fish fillets, about to switch to fish
rolls. Maybe I'll try selling some of the goods too :) (I regularly
give away foraged stuff to hungry groupmembers, but baked stuff would
be different)

I noticed that. I like brewing, but with berry pies being hearty
meals, I might as well save up my berries to make her pies instead of
letting her brew, and let her settle for becoming a fletcher.
