We did a 6-man ldon last nite (mnk, nec, dru, sk, pal, enc, all L35). The
paladin lull-pulled and tanked. He was wielding some weapon named Jeldorin.
No big surprise, he held agro all nite. We finished the adventure easily.
Then the pal and enc had to leave and the rest of us did a second adventure.

This time, without pal+enc to lull, I was going to pull and sk was going
to tank. Well, that was the theory. Somehow, when it came to down to it,
I held agro pretty much the entire night -- which came as a real surprise
to me.

Now, this is my 35 lizard monk, wielding a Patchwork Jetsam (2hb 30/35),
and using the 21% haste tribute buff. The sk had dinged 36 by the second
adventure. I didn't inspect him to see what he had, but his armor was all
dark blue (ie, likely bazaar-bought or alt gear), if that helps any. He
also had a pet up. The druid was on snare duty, so I doubt he was casting
Darkness line at all. And honestly, there was enough battle spam going off
that I couldn't tell you what (if any) spells he was casting.

When I switched to Iksar Berserker Club (1hb 7/18) and Fist of Wood (h2h
5/20), he was able to grab agro from me about halfway thru the battle.

So, to the question... what gives? I know my rogue has to evade from time
to time to shed agro. My bst can spam slows to hold agro, or *not* slow
and never hold agro. My sk seems to have no troubles holding agro if he
wants to, between taunt and a few high-agro/low-mana spells. I'd assumed
that since I never heard about "insane monk agro" that they really didn't
steal agro much. Is Patchwork Jetsam + 21% haste really unreasonable damage
for L35 monk? Are monks really agro monsters? Did we cripple the sk's hate
generation by making the druid snare (which would prevent his Darkness
from landing)? Was the sk just slacking? Underequipped? Undertwinked? :)
Should I have FD'd (at all? more?) during combat to let him take agro?

I'm not trying to foment a monk vs sk flame war. I'm just puzzled by
something that I never imagined would be an issue.
