What if you could form a group of 3 wizards, an enchanter, a cleric and a
bard and fight dozens of less powerful creatures at once?

What if the players decided to run up to their feet anyway?

What if we called them "those goofy mobs in N.Ro LDoN"?  What if some never
ran?  What if we called them skeletons?

What if some refused to take on more than 6, or 18, or 36, or 42, or 54, or
72?

What if somebody had an idea about a mob that refused to fight and then
tried and failed to figure out a way to actually make it challenging?  =P

What if kiting is, in itself, a form of aggro control?

What if I had to say a trigger phrase to start a fight?

What if oxymorons were a valid form of currency?  Assuming "useful" wasn't
the word you intended, I don't see why you ask the question, as traps and
ambushes have been used heavily in EQ since Luclin, and increasing most
every expansion.  If you instead mean player-made stuff, in a game with
static mobs (and dungeons designed around that concept) and no PvP to speak
of, their usefulness would be limited no matter how much you tried to make
them relevant.

If some mobs died when I looked at them with my frickin laser beams?

What if you had a mob called "Rallos Zek the Warlord" who just plain refused
to fight and had to be *hunted*?

Then we'd all be playing a different game.  Its name would be Guild Wars or
City of Heroes (only games I've seen that actually take that concept to any
length).

Why are you stumping for monks?  Oh, wait, you mean shadowknights, the class
*tied* for the #2 spot.  Don't let their healing ability fool you, it can be
deceptive.  Most shadowknights I know tank better than their paladin peers.
