Its all what you make it and the biggest part of that is who you play
with.  If you plan on playing past the 40s do what you can to gather a
fun group of folks to play with, as the people make all the difference
in terms of how much fun you have while slogging through upper levels. 
It doesn't all have to be mindless exp grind and phat lewt camps.  Why
just last night....

We had moved our group into a new part of a Velious dungeon that none of
us had ever seen.  Our level range was about 45 to 54, the dangers ahead
unknown.  The warrior cautiously moved forward, calling us to move up
when safe.  Then he made his fatal error.  He moved up to the next
corner of the hall we were in and called us to move up.  We did <EG>,
suddenly the big guy was surrounded by 4 party members, trapping him in
the corner.  Realizing the opportunity, my dwarven cleric ran full tilt
and launched himself upwards and then while on the barb shamans
shoulders, pressed hard against the warrior, preventing him from jumping
out.  Man did that big guy start cussing, though afterwards even he
admitted that the silliness had been good fun.  So there we were, a
group of high level chars in a dungeon full of unknown high level
terrors, acting like a bunch of lvl 3 gnomes fooling around in
Steamfont.

Yup, the high end game is what you make it.
