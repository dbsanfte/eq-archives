Nah...although I do have a Gem of NImbleness if you need one (still need
the Frontier Mountain Ore from Nurga/Droga and 500 pp to give to the dwarf.
Never PP a quest mob unless that's part of the quest (Clockwork Oil Stout
for BR quest, for instance, or the rogue GMs for the epic) because if they
aggro and you don't want to just die and you can't run, there's a chance you
may kill 'em and end up losing the faction you need to do the quest.

It's not true for every mob, but the Whistler is a decent weapon for 500 pp
and
a bit of time in 2 places, so I wouldn't risk it.

Then he's just pp'ing once or twice per mob, or not even on every
mob.  Cleaning a mob out is a fairly quick way to tell.

There have been some changes to pp since the game came out.  It
USED to pull cash/loot out of a completely separate pool, although I
think somebody got scared that somebody would spend 8 bazillion
hours pp'ing orc pawns to get one million plat 8 coppers at a time. So
they changed it, and instead of making the PP skill a lil' bonus and a bit
of fun, it's now actually a liablility to the class...one reason is you MUST
increase the skill if you ever want your epic.

Only solution is two fold...either pp a tiny bit from mobs you are fightng
with a group (and I challenge folks here to say that getting an extra
3 gold from a mob that you never knew was even there is going to
hurt your character) and skill up that way, or find a low level green
and practice PP/Disarm/ID on them all day for about two weeks.  Boring
but actually more fun that practicing up Pick Locks :-).

Yeah, sucks...but it's better than never having a group :-).

> Meh, I dunno.  I just needed to rant I guess :)

Nothing wrong with that...
