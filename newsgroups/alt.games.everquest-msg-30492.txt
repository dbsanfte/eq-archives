I for one had a fantastic PvP encounter last night, but it sure wasn't
in EQ.  If you want to really play PvP style games you need to get out
of EQ and find one that has a better system for such play.  EQ is
balanced for PvE and that balance is very much warped in terms of PvP. 
The game I was in last night allowed me to respond to an attack by a
higher level player in such a way that if another member of his faction
hadn't come along and shot me in the head from behind twice I would have
probably taken him down.  Tactics, skill and ability were overcoming
statistical disadvantage, battle may have been short, but good fun was
had by all.  Well he enjoyed it less when I pointed out that he had
help, he thought he'd killed me alone, but still, that was a PvP
moment.  Never had one of those in EQ PvP, only griefers.

If you really think you are ready, find a real PvP game.  Then come let
us  know how you liked it <EG>.
