And at the same time.. nobody is saying that they flip a switch and
EQ2 comes on and EQ shuts off. Both games will be up.. and both games
will be running. EQ2 will steadily phase out EQ.. but there are quite
a few people now in the middle of progression on EQ that are still
paying customers.

You can change 'replacing' to 'phasing out over time'. Any benefit
given to a current EQ player isn't going to include an account and
character carryover.

I still don't think you understand... there will be EQ servers as we
have now.. and EQ2 servers. They will work in parallel. And I would be
highly surprised if we didn't get an EQ expansion after EQ2 went live.
SOE has gotten them down to where they aren't terribly hard to write
or time/money consuming.

Just think of EQ2 as another mmorpg put out by Sony Online
Entertainment like SWG.. just supported and maintained on their
hardware by their people.

And the problem is that it would nuke any progression made in EQ. That
isn't gonna happen and people would cry bloody murder if Sony tried.
