In the end game raiding, that's debatable. Personally I go for AC, then
hps (stam maxed) but try to keep them fairly balanced. Until you hit
140-1500 ac buffed, go for AC, then start levelling them off

In upper end exp groups, AC has repeatedly parsed slightly ahead of pure
HPs, until you hit the point of diminishing returns where your AC is X
amount (or Y amount higher than the mob's HPs as some theories go)

In low and mid level exp groups, AC is still king, with stam/hps as a
secondary stat

Strength... erm... You can carry more loot that way I suppose, though a
single Tink bag would probably nullify any gain. If you can carry your
armour and loot, strength makes such a trivial different to damage over
time, you're much better served by looking at resists as a tertiary
stat.
