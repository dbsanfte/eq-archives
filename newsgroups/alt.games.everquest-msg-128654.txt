That doesn't matter for those who think war is outdated.  Of course, they
never say that when it's Palestine doing the attacking.

Well, it is a much better option than seeking peace with your host nation.
After all, that would require them to be peaceful.

It's as simple las this.  If the Palestinians want peace, they should pursue

they reap.
