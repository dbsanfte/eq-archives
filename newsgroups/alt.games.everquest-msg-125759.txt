Sometime in the past few weeks, one of the patches changed
foraging a bit, in a way that makes this less practical than
it used to be.

Up until the change, if you foraged continuously, all of
the foraged items would "stack up" on your cursor until
you had a moment to dump them into your inventory.

Now, however, if you already have anything on your
cursor, including a non-food item like an alternate
weapon, you will get the "you have foraged something"
success message, but the food item will not actually
be added to your cursor.

I presume it's simply discarded, although I suppose
there's a small chance it's dumped into your inventory
automatically.  But I doubt it.
