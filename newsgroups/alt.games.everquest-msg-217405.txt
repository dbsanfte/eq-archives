Personally, the issue for me is not one of whether the "ends" involve
acquisition of virtual or real property, but whether the "means" used to
acquire those ends include the breaking of very real and well understood
laws, ie, unauthorised access of computer system etc.

If say for example that purely ingame some troll warrior comes up and says
"hey man, nice sword, can I have a look" and then runs off with it, then no
out of game laws were broken so the only means or redress are those built
into the game system itself (ie, page a GM). On the flip side - if someone
acquired your authentication details and logged onto your account without
permission, then a real world law has been broken regardless of what else
transpires.
