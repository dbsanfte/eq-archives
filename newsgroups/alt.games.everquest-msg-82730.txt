It's a lot more likely that someone you gave your password to screwed
you up than Verant.

While it's possible there is a bug in the system that caused this to
happen to you, it's unlikely. And if you want to assume that there is
such a bug, then it stands to reason that with 400,000+ players over
the course of the past three years, it would have happened enough that
it would be a more widely reported problem.

Absolute first order of business, change your EQ password. And don't
give it out to *anyone*. Ever.

Second order of business is to ask politely if a GM will inspect the
logs for the appropriate time frame. They probably won't, but no harm
can come from asking.
