I haven't played with a 17" widescreen laptop (I"m assuming that's what 
you've got), and I don't really care to... too bulky and power hungry 
for my tastes... but that aside...

You may be able to change the resolution in EQ... try 1024x768 or even 
800x600 just to see what happens if you can. Although running an lcd 
outside of its 'official' resolution causes visual artifacts because 
lcds can only 'approximate' resolutions other than the manufactured one.

You *may* be able to restrict it to a more normal aspect ratio, and 
resolution set from within Windows (Display control panel); I don't know 
what if any options they give you on that front.

Try running it in windowed mode, and see how that looks/works.

Other than that, the lag may not be monitor related, do you have enough 
RAM, and video card strength to play EQ? Remember that "the mobility 
chipsets" and "mobile cpus" clocked at the same speed as their desktop 
counterparts are actually generally quite a bit slower, and when running 
from a battery (vs being plugged in) performance drops of 50% or more to 
prolong the battery are not unheard of in the laptop world.
