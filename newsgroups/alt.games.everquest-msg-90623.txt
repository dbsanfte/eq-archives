Some of the other responses here point out what wizards can contribute.
Some reasons you should be willing to group wizards in xp groups:
1) for a wizard to contribute effectively when he gets the spells that
make him highly valuable he's got to learn to group, the cost in lost
time/xp due to deaths from errors is a lot less at lo/lo-mid levels
(and TPWs are a lot less likely to result from a single mistake at those
levels), train 'em while they're young.
2) if the wiz is an incorrigible idiot the pain you suffer learning
this is a lot less for the same reasons.
3) when you start needing wizards you'll be the guy they remember who
actually invited them in when they wanted to group intead of shunning
them as if they were lepers, it never hurts to make friends and it may
pay off nicely down the road.

wishes there were more wizards around to group with
