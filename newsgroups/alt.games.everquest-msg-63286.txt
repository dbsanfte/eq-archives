It's possible that your DSL has a lower latency.  Everquest doen'st send
much data, so faster doesn't help much. My old DSL had really high ping
times which online games hate.  First makes sure you don't have any modem
tweaks in your registry.  Then do a ping and compare it to your dialup to
the same location.
