Well, forgive me, but while it's all very well to say "I dispute those
findings," unless you have log parsings which controvert the testing
that's already been done, we have to go with what we have, however
flawed it may be.  I'm sure you realize how unreliable subjective
impressions of these matters can be.

Just to clarify my position.  None of these buffs _hurt_, and they may
very well be useful one time out of fifty or so.  Call it even one
time out of thirty.  The question becomes whether that marginally
increased damage or haste or whatever one time out of thirty
compensates for the mana cost of the spell.

My own feeling is no.  For one thing, we're not talking about casting
the spell once.  If one person in the group gets it, everyone wants
it.  And when it runs out, they want it again.  And if the shaman
caves on giving that one, then likely he'll cave on the others, and
soon we have an oom shaman.

Oom is bad.  In my opinion, in an xp grind, a slight benefit one time
out of thirty does not begin to compensate for this.
