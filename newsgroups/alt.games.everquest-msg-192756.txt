Not really. I'd much rather you learn to be constructive rather than
making useless whine posts.

If you think that's nasty, then you have a whole lot to learn about
Usenet. That's mild.

Complain, yes, but do so in a constructive manner. Snide remarks
aren't constructive and, therefore, deemed pointless whining.

No, but, then, they have a complaint a little more valid than a stupid
game, and you're a shitbag for even thinking the two are remotely
comparable.

Wow. "My friend is a guide". Wasn't accepted for me (despite the fact
that it's true), won't be for you either (true or not).

Few things: Writing doesn't convey tone well. The rest of the post was
dumping on me. The statement was made in a "you should have known"
fashion. My response was not nasty. You are too easily offended for
Usenet, clearly. Or even real life.

First, I don't read every single post to the group. Second, I don't
jump on people who make complaints constructively. Third, people whose
first posts to the group are snide pot-shots don't make a good first
impression. Think about that...
