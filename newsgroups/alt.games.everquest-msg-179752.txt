Hehe people used to complain that nothing was ever happening on a 
roleplay side. Now that something happens and change something in 
norrath, not only they still complain, but they add some fake rumors to it!
Just see it as a roleplay event, the trolls town has been invaded, of 
course the trolls are gonna have to go through a hard time, but they'll 
be ok don't worry! I've seen lots of trolls yesterday while playing with 
my little dark elf, I think I've never seen that many PC trolls, even 
when I tried to make a shaman troll some months ago, for the fun, and 
they didn't seem to have any difficulty leveling and being equipped, and 
I'm not talking about the twinked ones! Actually they weren't unhappy at 
all to share the ground with so many cute dark elf females!! ;)
