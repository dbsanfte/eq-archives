Well, I haven't had anything like that, but I was, when I was but 3, given a
set of fine green leggings. These are something like AC12 and some light
stats.

I wore those things until a friend cave me a set of Sebilite leggings at 40,
and, though the improvement was obvious, I still had a sentimental time with
it.

To this day, at 51, I still wear a stupid skull-shaped barbute helm that a
Baron - who's name sadly goes unremembered - gave to me in Oasis when he was
helping us kill a spec at 15 or so (yes, a spec at 15 - he grouped with us,
beat the tar out of it with us - and then disbanded and mem blurred of some
variety and let us finish off the 30 or so HP it had left. I have no idea
how he held aggro with all us newbs running around ready to be killed in
about 3 blows by that spec.).

There is room in the game for sentiment....
