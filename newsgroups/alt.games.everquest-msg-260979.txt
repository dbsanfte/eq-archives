Your response is irrelevant and uninformative.

I even broke things down into short sentences, but you still have no 
idea what I'm talking about.

Its as though I read your post, and then said "elephants are rarely 
found in the congo."

Follow if you can:

OP:Bards restore mana while in camp
You: The hp restored is tiny compared to the damage a monk would do
ME Stop:  The guy was talking about mana, not HP.
You: we have a lot of bards

that means that for your guild, when you have multiple bards in camp, 
sending one out to pull doesn't cost you your AE mana regen, I can see 
that.  However, thats a special case and doesn't address the basic concept.

-IF- you'd said something along the lines of "in general maybe the mana 
regen would be nice but we have more than one bard so the AE mana is 
already taken care of" then your point might have made sense, except 
that then your comment about hp regen wouldn't have followed, since the 
hp will -also- be covered.

This isn't a timed debate, you can take the time to think thru what you 
are saying, what the other person is saying, and make sure that you are 
expressing your point clearly... and concisely.  Admittedly I don't do 
concisely too well, but I do try and make sure that I'm getting the 
salient details out and that I'm not contradicting myself too badly.
