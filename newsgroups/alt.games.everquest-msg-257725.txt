If you call for help you are unlocking the encounter.  You do not get xp
or loot.

You cannot have buffs from people who are not in your group.  If you
disband from a buffer the buff will fade.

You cannot heal someone who is in a locked encounter if you are outside
their group.

You cannot root or otherwise cc the mobs that are in a locked encounter if
you are outside their group.

Throw some more possibilities at me and I'll see if I can knock them down.
;)
