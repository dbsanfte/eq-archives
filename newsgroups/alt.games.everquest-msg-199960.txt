At 61 the difference in mana cost between Camo and Sup. Camo is
trivial, in 20s and 30s it has mattered a little.  As for the DoTs,
I'm wondering which ones you found too useless to retain?  I've not
had a Druid over 40 yet, but with DoT stacking I've not found any
DoT to be useless (well, ok, _because_ of DoT stacking Immolate is
nearly useless, $@^%! resists).
