That'd be fine if I'd said anything like that in my message, lol but I 
didn't. The resource collection metagame is just another layer on top of 
everything else, it's not anything you or I "signed up for", nor is it the 
excuse for a game, it's just another opportunity. You don't like it, that's 
fine, because you don't have to, there are plenty of other things to do.
