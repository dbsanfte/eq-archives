I would have to agree for the most part.  My main is a lvl 41 bard, and
though I enjoy the class, it is a bit demanding.  Most of my replies are
quick, mis-spelled, void of punctuation, and sometimes incromprehensible.
Chatting during combat is a luxury if you can pull it off.  If I'm twisting
3 songs or less I can usually make a little more sense, but more than 3 and
most of the time I will not answer unless things slow down.
Guild chat can be a very obnoxious thing to have on (as a bard) during
battle.  Especially if you have a couple guildies who can't seem to
understand that if you're not replying you're busy.  I can't tell you how
many times I will see "so-and-so tells the guild HEY BARD!  YOU THERE???
HELLO?  HELLO??"
Other than that, it's a great class.

Sean...
