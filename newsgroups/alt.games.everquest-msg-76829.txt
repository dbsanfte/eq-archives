Oh great! I was to hoping to have this problem fixed with this patch but I
guess not. After looking at the website last month to see what cards were
supported, I decided to go with the Rage Fury Pro - I guess it shouldn't be
on the list, eh? I still can't do a trade window with a PC without
everything on the interface flashing then going black (gems, spellbook,
hotkeys - not the regular window). It was a real bitch buying a pair of nice
gloves from someone then realizing I couldn't tell what kind of gloves they
were (risky shit when your spending a few Kpp) Luckily it turned out okay
but WHAT A FRIGGIN' HASSLE! Get with it Verant you lame-ass f*cks!
