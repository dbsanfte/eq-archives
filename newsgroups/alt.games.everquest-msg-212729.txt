What confuses me is how you bellyache about people selling things in the
bazaar (a legitimate sale) as cut throat and too much like real life, but
that you see yourself selling your own account in real life (an illegitimate
sale) as being fine.

If you really want to put your money where your mouth is, give all your
droppable items to some low level chars, camp, delete the characters (at
least the higher level ones), and cancel the account.  Delete all of your no
drop stuff before you camp if you really need to force yourself not to want
to come back.
