And on ANOTHER another note, I had Taellaar logged in tonight with his
new 200 range (yummy!) bow, ready to farm some kitty pelts to get that
last bit of cash for Nova's GEBs.  Suddenly someone asked about
started a 30s-40s group, and I looked at the time - 10pm!  Finally a
group request at an hour where I can play for awhile!  Leapt at the
chance, ran up to DSP, and ... found out it was just us two after all.
Shoot.  But he got us a group almost immediately  - of course he
/ooc'd that he and a *warrior* looking for a group - sheesh :p  I
/ooc'd that I was a *rogue*, not a warrior, but I guess the group
missed that because we got there and they asked me to pull and after a
few pulls went "uh, are you a rogue?"  Much apologies later group
member one says "rogue better than a warrior anyhow" and group member
2 says "I agree".

*happy sigh*  Got over a bubble and a half of yellow in the hour or
two I was on, made a new friend, and gave away my old bow to the
ranger who'd been happy to get a rogue instead of a warrior ;)


Ryou
(and god BLESS this beautiful, beautiful new bow)
