It means that whatever you kill has to give you exp to move your alt exp 
bar.  If you are level 60, then it has to be light blue to you at least to 
give exp, which is down to level 41ish or so (based on what I'm seeing is 
light blue to 59).  If you are level 51, then it's down to level 35 or so.  
Of course since it takes the same total experience for 1 alt adv point no 
matter what level you are, it's much eaiser to get once you are level 60.  
By that I mean that a level 45 mob gives the same total exp to a level 60 
as it does to a level 51, but it's much, much easier for a level 60 to 
kill that.  Say it takes 150 level 45 mobs to ding from 51 to 52.  It 
would take 150 level 45 mobs to get an alt exp point, if you're level 51 
or if you're level 60.
The difference in your power between level 50 and level 60 is incredible, 
so much so that I really can't see any reason to do alt exp before 60, but 
some folks see it differently.
