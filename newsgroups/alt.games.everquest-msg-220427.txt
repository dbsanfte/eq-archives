"My people.. We have a way you see. We know how, and sometimes even when, we
are going to die. Comes in a dream. In my dream I am an old man, it's 20
years from now, and I am dying. My hands wrapped around someone's throat,
and his around mine. We have squeezed the life out of each other. The first
time I saw G'Kar I recognized him as the one from the dream. It will happen.
20 years from now, we'll die with hands around each others' throats."
