Well, I may as well throw myself back into the frying pan, as I'm sure
Biz will take this the wrong way, but what the fuck. Jeff...... good
luck in your solo career. [NOTE: BIG NOTE: I'm NOT saying Biz is an
asshole in every situation, obviously. But the advice above about "Fuck
'em. You're either ready or you're not is NOT applicable to all
situations.] Keep in mind that Biz has solo'd to 57 or 58, and that
gives you a lot more flexibiltiy in how often you can say "fuck 'em".
There's absolutely nothing wrong with that, but your attitude has to be
a *bit* tempered if you plan on grouping, guilding, etc. or getting into
the tier one zones.  Yes. In the specific situation described initially,
there's certainly room to say that taking the camp mobs was cool. And in
the newbie levels, you can get away with a lot more of that shit and not
have it burn you. But, (again, unless you plan to *only* solo)
reputation is a motherfucker in Norrath. And the higher you go, the
smaller the community gets, and the more a "dickhead" repuatation will
come back to haunt you.

Group/Guild/Raid camping protocol *is* respected in the upper end of the
game, [Let's leave Uberguild fights over boss mobs out of this] even if
VI and the GM's refuse to acknowledge it. It's a VERY big thing. If you
get a reputation as a perpetual camp jumper, you'll be fucked for the
kind of support you'll need for epic raids, etc. And sometimes camps
*do* take a little while to get organized. Particularly raids on big
shit. I'm not talking about Orc One in EC. I mean later on. But you may
as well get in the habit of good manners early on and get a clean rep.
It never hurst to ask a group if they are camping, or getting ready to,
etc. They may be medding or recoving from a wipeout etc. *CAN* you just
take their camp away in that case if the mobs are spawned? Sure! Any GM
in the game will back you up too. Should you? Let your conscience be
your guide.

Example:  Few weeks back we were setting up for a Kael raid. About ten
minutes after we showed up, we were still waiting for the last two
chanters to run in from the GD portal. Another group had shown up on the
WL side and was also forming up fast. But their leader contacted me,
seeing we already had a raid force in place (still at zone in) and asked
what we were doing. I said "Hoping to move to Arena, but we still have
two guys incoming."

He was ready to go, and could have beaten us there easily. What did he
do? He said, "Ok. Moving to Riff house. Let us know if you clear out
early cause we'd like to do Arena too."

Nice, neat, simple. Situation reversed, I'd have done the same. You fuck
over too many people jumping camps, pretty soon you'll find out just how
much of the end game you can do on your own, and it's damned little. And
there's a lot of zones you will *never* see. (And they tend to be the
ones with the really nice drops, too.<g>)
