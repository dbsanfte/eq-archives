  In the end, it was anticlimactic. Apparently, the gaming gods must
have decided I'd waited long enough, and gave Adas elemental access
practiaclly gift-wrapped.
  Our guild leader wasn't on Saturday morning; another officer was
walking us through rune farming. We were about to pull MSL when
someone in the Bertox General channel announced an open RZ raid
forming. I had my doubts, and expressed them: "Bit early for that,
isn't it?" Presumably, they were just calling the raid four hours in
advance to make sure they got enough people.
  The guy said he always did his open RZ raids around this time.
Hmmm. I'd taken to leaving the General channel to cut down on
spam messages, so I supposed it was possible. I asked how many
poeple he usually got, and how often he won. He said 50ish, and
usually won.
  This sounded promising, if it was true. After Slavedriver Menlo
went down, our officers decided to release us for the day, hoping
we would have good luck against RZ, which would benefit the
guild most. Off we went to bind outside Tactics and zone in to
have a frank exchange of views with the Warlord.
  When we got 50 people in raid we started to move; by the time
we were ready to kill the trigger mobs we had 60. Trigger mobs
down, VZ and TZ down, so far so good. The real test of our
strength was against fake RZ: he went down so fast I could
only get off 4 nukes. It helped that I had bought Quick Damage
1 and 2 recently, and was one AA away from level 3. All told,
we had monster DPS.
  Fake RZ only killed three or four people; recovery was fast,
and we picked up six more heading into the pit. Of course,
someone ran straight out over the pit and aggroed RZtW,
training him on the raid as we were getting into proper position.
We recovered well, though, pinning him to the corner; again,
we applied our huge DPS, and he went down faster than I'd
seen in my previous three tries. So fast, in fact, the adds didn't
have time to catch any of our kiters. I waited for the order to
take the TL out, cursor hovering over the accept button.
Instead, the raid leader cancelled the TL order and told us
to just get to work on the adds.
  Merry chaos reigned in the pit for the next several minutes.
Mobs running everywhere, people trying to grab aggro and
off-tank. I threw nukes at anything that got below 90%.
Amazingly few of us died, Adas not among them. The last
adds were finished off, Planar Projection hailed, and rolls
for the Blade of War started. I ported my group back to
PoK for the actual flagging.
  This took about ten minutes of running around, talking to
Maelin and the seer, getting another AA from the dwarf,
and figuring out how to click on the entrance to the Plane
of Water, which always seemed to be out of reach. Finally,
though, I made it in, confirming that Adas was fully elemental
at last. Woot!
  Monday, Saviours tested its new Elemental force; we farmed
Water, getting many elemental patterns and molds, and some
good drops. This is huge, as we are running out of OOW rune
needs, and the drops are a little better on the planes. With
regular farming of Water, Air, and Earth A, we are ready for
the next level. And with allies to help us get through Plane
of Time phase 1 and 2, we gear up even faster, and will soon
have Adas and everyone else flagged for Time.
  I know I'm at the peak of my karma cycle; further advancement
will likely have to wait another month. But things are different
now; there's a real feeling Adas has made it to the top.
Days like these you can really enjoy the ride.
