I've had similar problems. I spread my 16ish characters across many
servers.  However, it's not really a problem.  Find target zones
within the level range of whichever character it is you're playing. 
That's the secret, find a busy zone for your level.  For example, my
druid, from 40 to 46 has been busy in dreadlands.  I go to that zone
and shout until I get into a group.  After a day or so of that
(waiting for invites), if no group is open (now), I start one.  Start
groups when you need to.  Be assertive, take the lead, others will
follow. Don't be shy.  The issue isn't really class, it's confidence.
Make an impression on others as being a good group player and they
won't forget you.  If they do and you're comfortable starting groups,
it won't matter.

I think this approach works well until you want to get included on
plane raids.  At that point in time, unless there's a "pick up" raid,
chances are you're going to want a group of reliable folks to know and
invite you along to play in the reindeer games.
