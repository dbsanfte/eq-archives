Boy, would like like to see something like this that I had confidence in.

The reason I doubt if these numbers are correct is the use of Cinda's
Charismatic Carillon (bard song). At 62, it's worth a 630 faction adjustment
according to Lucy. That should be non-instrument modified, so, with a 2.0
mod, I should see a 1260 faction mod.

Well, I MQ'd a drop from Sky to a ranger in my guild a week or so ago, and I
couldn't get from dubious to anything above that without using the sneak
from behind trick. Straight faction song didn't get me there - even a 2.4
mod flute didn't help. It's interesting that I CAN get from warmly to ally
with CoV, but, then again, I'm not sure how far into Warmly I already was
(probably 4-5 helm turn ins).
