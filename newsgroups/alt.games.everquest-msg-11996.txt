There was a Marine Reserve artillery unit in L.A. called Bravo Battery.  They
were so incompetent that it took them over an hour to get the first round out
and they seldom, if ever, actually hit the target.  For the uninitiated, land
based arty should always hit the target; any errors are the fault of the
spotter.  These guys varied over 100-150m off target on each shot.

Of course, these days I feel like a neolithic relic when I see the computer map
devices that spotters use.  In my day (cue the Led Zeppelin music and light the
incense) we determined coordinates with binoculars and a paper map.
