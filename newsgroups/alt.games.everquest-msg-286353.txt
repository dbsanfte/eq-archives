Prelgor answered about Fabled stuff in general (and I think I'll save
that response and fold it into the FAQ at some point).

Regarding the Fabled Jboots, they do not involve the Ancient Cyclops
at all; the fabled boots drop directly from Fabled Drelzna just like
the original jboots used to drop from regular Drelzna.

The fabled boots are the equivalent of Run 5, and none of my characters
have more than Run 3 yet, so this last Fabled Month I went and got boots
for most of my characters who hadn't gotten them last year.  (The druid
turned up her nose at them. :-)  In a fit of conspicuous twinkage, I even
unloaded enough junk from my bazaar mule to let me waddle out to Najena
and get a set of boots; makes running around the bazaar much quicker!

Oh, and the fact that the boots are insta-cast can be a big deal,
especially if you're already running away from a mob when you notice
that your old movement buff has worn off...
