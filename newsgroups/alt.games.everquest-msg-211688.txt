Yep, given the choice for an xp group, I will take a knight over a 
warrior every time.

Yep, for xp groups, most people know now that knight>warrior.  Some 
inexperienced warriors may not be aware of this yet however.  :b

Last night I got elected to pull in SolC due to level.  It did seem to 
help a bit, I could get only 2 or 3 instead of 3 or 4 on a pull.  It was 
quite entertaining really, I was slower/healer for the group.  60-59-60-
59 rogue (two deaths, not during the fighting, one getting to SolC, one 
leaving.)  57 monk, 62 warrior, 60 warrior, 64 mage.  It was very 
interesting to say the least, as other than offtanking, I was crowd 
control as well as the only slower and only healer in the group.  Lots of 
bandages were summoned that night, good thing the rogue had 205 BW, that 
helped a lot.  XP was not bad at all, got one decent shoulder drop.  Only 
one death during the time in SolC, when the warrior found out what lived 
in the lava while pulling a tentacle terror type mob, and decided to take 
one for the team.
