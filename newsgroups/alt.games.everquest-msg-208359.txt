Illegal by definition, pyramid scheme forbidden by the US/Canadian
postal services as well as European ones as far as I know.

And you were right. it is a harmless scam, though, since
no one actually ever sends the money to anyone else. Just posting 
your address for someone to send the money is enough to get on the 
bad side of the postal authorities, as well as your ISP.

Spamming it in newsgroups is also frowned on.
