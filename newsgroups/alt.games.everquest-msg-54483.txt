Wow.  Backwards, even.  Do you mind taking a few minutes and explaining how 
to quad-kite with a Wizzie at level 16 or so?  Where would you do this?  
What spells?  I'm having trouble grasping the ability to outdistance the 
Mob so you can cast your rain / spiral / <insert the quadding spell here> 
without getting a) interrupred b) squashed.

If SoW / JBoots / SoW potions are the answer, then I get it, otherwise, I 
need some help.
