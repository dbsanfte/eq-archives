Quentin, I thank you for the wealth of information you've provided me! I
have 2 drives that I am aware of -- c:, of course, and d: which says save
drive or something like that. I checked d and it has about a gig (can't
recall the exact figure). The machine itself has a 60 gig hard drive and
it's nowhere near to even halfway full, and I'm running XP. I did enable
some textures, but not all (shammy and dwarves still look the same, but the
other classes all have the new textures... and I wonder how they made -that-
distinction?), but I don't think I set them to low... I'll have to check
that.

I'll check the VM myself, as per your instructions.... ok, I checked VM as
you said, and all I could see was that it said "Total paging file size for
all drives 312mb."  Should I change that? I have it set so that XP makes
decisions about that kind of stuff... maybe I am far too trusting in the
Evil Empire ;) It also says that I have to be an administrator to make
changes, and I don't recall whether I set it up that way or not, though I'm
certain there's a way to find out.

Again, many thanks!

Darklet
