Here's a fairly simple question that I was never very sure about:
Does the x% increase mean that your overall mitigation and avoidance
skills are x% better or that you are actually x% less likely to be hit
by any given incoming blow and will take x% less damage from those
that to hit?

I have always assumed that CA3 (for example) meant that your
dodge+riposte+block skill (or some overall avoidance skill
calculation) was just raised 10% by CA3 and that how much better you
mitigate would depend on the mob you were fighting.  Anyone (with a
shred of proof, not observational data please) know for sure which it
is?
