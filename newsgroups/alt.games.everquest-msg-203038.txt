Mobs have been casting  SoW indoors since the game started.
Do you only fight outdoors? Or are you just being sarcastic?

Bottom line is mobs don't follow the same rules as PCs.
They don't drown.
They don't take lava damage.
They don't take falling damage.
They regen health and mana 20 faster stand than PCs do sitting.
They can warp to you if they get stuck on the world geometry.
They can see thru and ignore walls.
etc.

Its a good thing to because they are dumb as rocks.
If they had to follow the same rules as PCs then this game
would be too trivial.
