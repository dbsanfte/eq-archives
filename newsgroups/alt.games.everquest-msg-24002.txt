Look again.  The original 3 are almost always the least used servers.
Sullon was averaging about 3000 a night (USA time zones) for the first 2
weeks.  Now it has dropped to about 2300-2500 avg which puts it in 4th or
5th place in usage.  I think that number will be dropping further.

The reason many people don't like the PvP environment in EQ is that it was
poorly thought out.  Sullon has the most RP elements and still fails
miserably (IMO).  The problems with starting areas was not addressed
effectively, which means that the "Evil" chars get a huge head start and the
"good" chars are in a very bad situation from the start.  I tried Sullon and
Vallon and found way too many people whose sole purpose in life was to cause
grief for the newbies and very few who would help someone starting out.
