> He did say melee.   :-p

I have been very carefull not to relate parses recently . This is partly due
to the fact that i think monks are severely underpowered and warriors
somewhat underpowered and really just dont want to hear the caster howls.
Casters in ldon suffer from lack of mana as well as problems overaggroing .
This combined with instant access to as many mobs as you would like have
made the all melee dps group the best kill over time rate in ldon.

Warriors need a better taunt.
Monks need MUCH more defense.
Neither one needs more dps.

Rangers are easily in the top 5 classes overall and amazing dps.
Beastmasters are easily in the top 5 classes and very nice dps.
Rogues are not suffering in ldon at all.
Monks are fine dps as long as they are attacking from the rear of the mob.
