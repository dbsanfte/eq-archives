I charge 2 copper for a res if you drag to me, 2Kpp if
I have to leave my group to come do it.  I used to ask
1Kpp for the latter, but someone took me up on it.  If
someone elects to pay 2K, I'll do it and then change
pricing to 4Kpp.

I can afford 2cp because there is no cost to me other
than mana, and I have plenty of time to find a moment
where I have lots of mana but the group I'm with is
medding.

Likewise, I would not, in your case, consider leaving
a group to do a bunch of running around.  If they
need a summon, they should bring a coffin to you.
Just casting the spell, in a zone you are already in,
with coffin supplied, I wouldn't charge at all.

Likewise, if you are soloing, and they provide all
travel arrangements, I wouldn't think a large outlay
would be expected.

If they expect you to handle all arrangements, as
you outlined, well, I'd charge 1kpp with a straight
face.  Unlike my 2kpp for a res, 1kpp for a
summon is not unreasonable.  The corpse doubtless
has 10 times that much in equipment on it, and has
already been deemed unrecoverable by normal
resources.

To leave a group, though, well, you can't pay me
enough to abandon my friends.
