I will tell you this:  I got from 1 to 65 without ever using Atone in a
fight.  Heck, I've hardly used Atone at all.  Enchanters' memblur is much
more effective.

As a cleric leveling up, its only real use might be to deal with mobs that
aggro you while you're running through a zone.  Then you can root and atone
them, and when root breaks they won't come after you.

Myself, I found that fearing mobs was much more reliable.  Only takes one
spell slot and fails much less often.  Fear was my "travelling spell";
whenever I had to go someplace like Chardok, which would take me through
Burning Woods, I'd memorize my fear spell and cast it on anything that
aggro'd me.  By the time fear wore off, the mob was much too far away to
bother me.

I did find one practical application for Atone very recently.  I went to the
Crypt of Nadox to farm some of the mobs there for the components of the Pure
Blood spell.  While trying to get to where I needed to go, I aggro'd a fire
elemental.  Now, the mobs here, although green, are very tough for a cleric
to solo.  I could have killed him in a five-minute fight, but I didn't want
to waste the time.  And I couldn't just fear him off because I was staying
in the zone, and when fear wore off he would find me and bring some friends.
So I rooted him, atoned him, and after root broke he wandered back to his
spawn point.  Saved myself time and mana that way.

So if you want to clear aggro on a mob in a zone you'll be staying in, Atone
can be of use.  For groups, though, I usually content myself with rooting
adds, since we'll probably want to kill them anyway.
