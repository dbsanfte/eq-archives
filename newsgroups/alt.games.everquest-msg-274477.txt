Dictionary definitions are actually ranked according to the frequency of 
definition usage. Thus if you see the word and just look it up, odds are 
that the first definition will apply, if not, odds are the next 
definition will be the right one and so on.

Of course, dictionaries are perpetually out of date, and slang changes 
much faster than even the rest of the language. So dictionary sequencing 
isn't that reliable, particularly for slang.

But I've said it a few times now. I thoroughly beleive that pussy as 
coward is a play on the sexist sterotype but, really, it doesn't even 
matter what the etymology of pussy as coward is. Even if it did jump 
from 'fraidy cat' (although that begs the question of why 'fraidy 
pussy' has never until just now been uttered) the vulgar usages are too 
dominant to ignore.

If faggot happened to mean a bundle of twigs and sticks (hint: it 
actually does) and I called a mob a dried up little faggot as a metaphor 
for how quickly we burnt him down ... it really wouldn't make the least 
bit of difference given what the predominant use of the word faggot is, 
and the ambiguous context.
