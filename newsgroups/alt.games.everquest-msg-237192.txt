It's reasonable to assume that God has complete and total knowledge
of things that have *already occurred.*  So when someone dies and
is judged, God does indeed have all the facts.

I think the "unknowable" reference was meant to illustrate that
humans have free will, and therefore God may not be able to accurately
*predict* some things.
