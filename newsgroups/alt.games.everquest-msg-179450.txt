First, it was a long time ago.  Over a year.  But now that you mention the
screaming that would have resulted, I'm pretty sure we didn't do that.  But
memory tells me that we did bring the trains to some guards somewhere in
Oasis.  Hmmm.  Then again, I do remember high-levels camping the spectres
(wraiths?) on the island in the middle of that pond and them telling us to
bring to them anything we couldn't handle.  They setting up their camp about
the halfway point between where our camp was and the docks.  Maybe they were
the "guards" that I remember.  We did it for over 12 hours and it happened
many days after I had come to level in Oasis so I really doubt we trained
the docks.  This is not to say I haven't done really stupid things in EQ.  I
just don't recall getting yelled at once during that 12-hour period for
stupidly training the guardless docks.
