You have yet to present a convincing arguement...no, I take that back; you
have yet to present ANY arguement that slaughtering people or being
slaughtered is fun. Since this is now the third chance, I'm going to assume
that you have no such arguements. You lose. Go away.

Actually yes, I've killed in PoF alone.

No, hate sucks.

If you think massing overwhelming force and beating people in the frontier
without them ever having a chance OR being overwhelmed by massed forces
without having a chance is fun, then you are exactly as dumb as your posts
indicate. If there was a way for balanced fights against equal numbers (or
a level disparity to compensate for numerical lopsidedness), where nobody
attacked anyone who had just finished fighting, or any other typical
KewlD00d PK bullshit, I would probably love the game. I am willing to trade
50 pounds of real life inspired tactical realism for an ounce of fun.

Hint: REAL LIFE COMBAT IS NOT FUN, IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU WIN OR LOSE.
My desire to pay $12.95 a month (or whatever they are charging) to not have
fun in a game is roughly the same as my desire to lance out my eyeballs
with rusty red hot needles.
