After being away from EQ for more than a year (like 16 months) I find all
the zones I used to hunt in nearly empty.

I don't mind travelling to new places, but would like to find at guild to
join that isn't like the one I'm already in -- my main character is a level
30 warrior with two alts -- 25 druid and 48 cleric -- and  they're all in
their mid-50s to mid-60s and have no time for me. I'm normally a late-night
player who gets home at about 2 a.m. EST. They're great folks, but I never
see them except in guild chat.

I know this isn't the place to look for a guild, but I'd also erased all my
former Everquest links. I'm on Povar.
