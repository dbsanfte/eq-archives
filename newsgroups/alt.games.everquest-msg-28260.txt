Harmony is a very tricky spell to work with. The following is what I can give
and have found out about harmony.

1. Line of Site
Harmony is a line of site spell. Furthermore, it is a complete line of site
spell. The target you wish to harmony must be completely in your line of site
for it to work on them. If the mobs arm is hidden by a wall edge, harmony will
not work. If the mobs feet are hidding by a ledge, harmony will not work

2. Area of Effect
Harmony is an area of effect spell. Casting in on one mob may cause it to hit
others mobs as well. The problem is that it seems that the area of effect for
harmony my be small. So that a mob may still be in assist range of another mob
while being out of the area of effect range of harmony. In general, most people
that use harmony do not complete trust the area of effect component of harmony.
They follow one general rule. "When in doubt, harmonize everything."

3. Outdoor spell only
Harmony is a spell that will work in outdoor zones only. Some zones are
classified as dungeon zones but can still be outdoor zones. These zone are ones
where the mob concentation is tightly packed but is still a zoned that is
considered outdoors. Examples of such zones are Mistmoore Castle, Cazic Thule,
Karnor Castle, and Plane of Hate. All of those zones are outdoor dungeon zones
and harmony is a spell that can be used in it.

4. Resistance
It is believed that harmony cannot be resisted on the primary target. It may be
resisted on its Area of Effect component but if it is it will not aggro. This
possible resistance on the AoE component is another reason not to trust it and
to cast it on all mobs present. I can assure you that the primary target does
not get a resist check though. I have personally casted the spell on mobs that
are known to be 100% resistent to all types of magic and have had it work on
those mobs. The Black Reavers in City of Mist is an example of a mob that can be
harmonized.

5. Casting Level
There does not appear to be any level difference cap for harmony. It appears
that if a druid/ranger is able to cast harmony in the zone, able to completely
see the mob and able to get in range of a mob, they will be able to cast harmony
on that mob even if it is so bloody dark red conned as to leave a smear on the
floor with you. The general problem is that some mobs have an aggro radius that
is larger then the casting range of a mob. The higher a mobs level to the
caster, the large their aggro radius is. This could cause certain mobs to that
may be to high to be un-harmonizable soly on the basis that you cannot get into
casting range of them without aggroing them. The ogre chief in West Karana is an
example of this. That mob has an aggro radius that is larger then the casting
range of harmony.
