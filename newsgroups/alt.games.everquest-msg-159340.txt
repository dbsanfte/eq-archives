I've never noticed a higher chance with two handers proc'ing more than one
handers. Although in all fairness, I've used 2HS for a great majority of my
SK's 'life.' (Heh, since level 5.)

I don't think restating my arguement has helped anymore than it has for you,
wouldn't you agree?

-Even if 2-handers have a higher chance to proc than 1-handers (which may
very well be true)- I can easily counter with a pair of 1-handed weapons.

The proc rate is most likely linked to the weapon. For example, the Hammer
of Judgement, Divinity, Souls, and Damnation all have the same stats and
proc (as far as I know - the Hammer of Damnation may have different stats as
it is a PoP spell) but have highly different proc rates.

My very original point was that Larsson's Haste did infact boost his chance
to proc over a set time since he got <gasp> more chances to attack.

(The least you could do is snip my quote in the right place.)

Unfortunately, it's very difficult to prove proc-rates (or anything
seemingly random) via logs. Who knows? Over 10 swings I may get 6 procs with
a low delay weapon while over 10 swings with a high delay weapon I get none.

I'm not a real firm believer in logs - they can be doctored and once again,
with something so random as procs, it can be about how lucky you are.
