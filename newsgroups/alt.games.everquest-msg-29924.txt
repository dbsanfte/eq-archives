I've really gotten to like my 4 circle pet spell.  The skellies are pretty
tall and large and fight with fearless dedication.  I realize in twisted
dungeons they tend to get lost, in fact have pulled some good sized trains
of me.
My question is, why do they refuse to listen to commands sometimes?  The
gnolls in BB aggro extremely easy on them or is it vice versa?  He'll just
go from one gnoll to another ignoring any command I throw at it.
I was in a group the other day and the leader was screaming at me to stop it
because the whole area was aggroing and closing in.  Hey, if I could have
stopped it I would have!  He got over it once we got a handle on the
situation, but even /pet get lost wouldn't work.  What gives????
I really get nervous when /pet guard me is ignored and the only response I
get is Taunting attacker master.  ACK!!!  INCOMING TRAAAAAAAIN!!!
Maybe I should have it neutered?
TIA for any suggestions.
