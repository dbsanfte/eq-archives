For the most part, it sounds innocent, especially in Gfay area.  Now if you
were in Crushbone, it MIGHT be an issue, but in Gfay, it is a common
occurance it isn't so bad.

Now if it was like an Orc Legionaire or an Orc Emissary, or Orc Oracle,
Lord Darish, Orc Warlord, or Emperor Crush or something like that, you
might have issues, but then, anyone stupid enough to pull Darish or Crush
from their spot doesn't have the right to complain if they are running.
For the most part, people who run Orcs a long way, they aren't pulling ,
especially if you don't see groups of people nearby.  If they are pulling,
they need help mentally.
