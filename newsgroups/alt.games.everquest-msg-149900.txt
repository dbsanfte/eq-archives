Well, actually, I was thinking of Bard.  A Bard in the hands of a
skilled player can solo when he feels like it, greatly enhance the
strength of most any group, and make a very substantial contribution
to a raid.  Purely in terms of game mechanics (ignoring RL issues
like carpal tunnel syndrome and the requirement that the player
start with an IQ above room temperature and actually take the time
to acquire the necessary knowledge and skill) the only downside I
can see is that Bards don't seem to stack as well as some other
classes.  Overall, I've never seen any class that could walk in
and single-handedly transform a group from "barely able to cope"
into "chain-killing machine" the way a Bard can.  Sure, there are
some situations that another class can have that effect, but as far
as I can tell a Bard is capable of having that effect most any time.
