It's a 3rd-party program that affects gameplay. Hell yeah there's a
chance of getting banned. Xylobot is just a program that used to be
called "EQMacros" that was reworked to work with other games as well
in order for the maker to "sidestep" a lawsuit Verant threw at them...
EQMacros was closed down for a while in compliance with the threats,
bu re-opened later with this new program. At the rate he's publicizing
now, I'd be surprised if he doesn't eventually end up in the sights of
another lawsuit threat.
