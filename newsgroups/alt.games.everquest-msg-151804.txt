In fact, for much of the game, there *are* other classes the nuke almost as
well as Wizards.  Besides Druids, there are Mages.  At some levels, Mages
arguably have better nukes than Wizards.

What really sets Wizards apart is that we have fire, cold, and magic nukes.
The other classes will run into mobs that are very resistant to the kind of
nuke they have--Wizards just switch to a different kind and keep going.
And, if that is not enough, we get Lures in the 50s.  Also, I believe Verant
has said that all Wizard nukes have a minor bonus on resistance checks, so
even our non-Lures have a minor Lure-like quality.
