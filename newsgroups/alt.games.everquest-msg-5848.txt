Okay, I'm in Splitpaw with a high 20's - low 30's group.  We're staying near
the entrance, taking on the gnolls in ones or twos.  Doing good making good
XP.  My Cleric does his usual "med-heal-med" routine, taking no part in the
combat.  So I don't see what happens, but this is what I see:

"Oh fhxl!"

"2 Mas"

"ZONE"

This is followed by the Troll SK dying *very* quickly, before I can even
stand up.  I manage to cast one Greater Heal on the second tank as she runs
past me.  Then I turn and run.  I make it to the zone boundary but stop
there to see if I can save anyone else.  I turn around... and there are
three gnolls grinning at me.  SMASH, CRUNCH, SMASH, and half my health is
gone before I can blink.  I back up towards the zone, pretty sure I don't
have time to turn around and run.  SMASH, CRUNCH, down to one bubble,
SMASH...

LOADING, PLEASE WAIT

Those words are a blessed relief so long as you're not looking at a top-down
view of your corpse as they come up.  I let out a breath and wait for the
zone to load so I can assess my party's damage.  It does indeed load.  But
not at the dungeon entrance.  I'm at my bind point, elsewhere in SK near the
bridge.

My first thought is that I did indeed die.  But I have all my equipment.  I
have a mere sliver of health, but I'm not unconscious or anything.

Two or my party died, the rest zoned, and I make the journey back towards
Splitpaw, ready to heal those who lived and waiting for those that died to
make their CR.

But I'm still puzzled.  Why, when I zoned, did I end up at my bind point?
Did the game *expect* me to die and put me at my bind point in anticipation
of my demise?  This has never happened to me before or since.

Is this a bug anyone else has encountered?

Nothing terribly inconvenient - just darned odd.  :)
