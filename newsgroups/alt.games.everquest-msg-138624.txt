  If you're applying to a US government job, they'll ask for your SSN on 
your resume if you don't provide one of the standard employment 
application forms. I had to do it myself recently. 
  (By the way, ten-plus months of unemployment officially end on August 
12th. I got the job. It's going to seriously cut into my EQ time, but 
hey...)
