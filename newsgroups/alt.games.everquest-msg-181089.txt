Cosmetic, yes, but the speed bump was a source of a LOT of frustration
for players on the road to levelling. I know more than a few
characters that were abandoned at 40 or 45 (after dropping back into
the level several times from getting killed in the following
sometimes) by people because of the slowdown. At least in the 50's,
you start feeling the power and something to look forward to each
level (new spells every level, even if they aren't always good, tend
to motivate certain player types).
