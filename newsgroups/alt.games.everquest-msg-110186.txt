Aye, let me snip to put the two quotes closer together for ya, there.  
You'll note that Germany and Japan were not part of that 'single human 
society', were they?

Umm... Texas.  That little "Death Penalty" thing.  You know, where they 
redefine humans as "criminals" so they can get away with murder?  Ok, I'm 
unfairly picking on Texas, there's plenty of other places. :)

Native Americans weren't too big on that whole 'property' idea.  And a 
certain European fellow once suggested that property was 'theft', which 
suggests to me that in his moral view, and that of his followers, it 
wasn't something to safeguard...

Sorry, marriage was recently legally redefined to mean just one man and 
one woman.  So early Mormonism springs to mind.

Ya got me there.  I don't know how universal foster homes and adoption 
are.

I really must object.  I was not properly notified of when we got to vote, 
nor did I receive a ballot.

Depends on how many of them are saying that it's evil for fear of reprisal 
from the world's largest superpower if they disagree...

}And there is indeed an "ultimate universal definition of 'good' and

Funny how people's decisions tend to have a subjective basis...
