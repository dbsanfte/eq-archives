There *is* something wrong with this zone. We're talking a <30
dungeon, we should be getting exp bonuses out the wazoo like the other
low level luclin dungeon.

Instead, experience was beyond pitiful. I was barely outleveling my
other current active 25 levels higher. Pulls were moderately fast,
they went down moderately fast, and there was no downtime.

I moved beyond the levels to hunt here early last week but its still
bugging me. That zone should have been giving FAR better experience
than it was.
