Have you tried this? Find the file named hosts.sam on your
hard drive, open it in notepad and add the following line:

64.37.156.21    patch.everquest.com

Then save it in the same folder as hosts (NOT hosts.txt)
It's important that there be no file extension. It really
sounds like a DNS problem. If it is then this WILL fix it.
