They are all 32k hps.

Gorenaire has an ice aoe that debuffs attack speed. Best to take her with
casters.

Trakanon has a nasty poison/disease dot aoe. Kill him quick or it gets
messy. You have to pull stuff around him which makes him a bit tricky.

Talendor is trivial . Basic fire aoe. Can be done with like 3 people with
the proper pets :)

Severilous is disease or poison cant remember which.
