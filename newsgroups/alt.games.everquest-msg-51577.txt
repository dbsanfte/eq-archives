You've been soloing most of the way, taking your own hits, seeing
Defense rise consistently?  You have an advantage over the Halfling
druid who is wearing plat armbands over ulthork arms.  As a Halfelf, I
think your Sta and Agi are higher so you are able to take those hits
better, but thank you for correcting my mistake.
