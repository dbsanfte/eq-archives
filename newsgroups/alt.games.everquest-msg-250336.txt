Exactly!  Difficult travel didn't keep people from going to awkward
places, but once they got there they stayed there.  And it worked as
long as the place was well-populated (by players, that is).  (Although
if it was over-crowded that could be an issue, but at least you had
lots of people there to chat with.)  But now, too many of these zones
are mostly empty, so people don't want to spend the time to get there
only to find they can't form a group.  They'd rather form the group
in PoK (or an LDoN camp) and then go somewhere, and that means they're
going to go someplace that doesn't take long to reach.

That does beg the question of why the remote zones are empty in the
first place.  The theory I offered was that it's due at least in part
to the expanding world; more content for roughly the same number of
players means fewer players per spot.  But there's also undoubtedly
an effect from mudflation, where old hot spots become less interesting
because expansions have added places with better xp and/or loot, or
because the player base has become top-heavy and the old zones are too
low level to be interesting.
