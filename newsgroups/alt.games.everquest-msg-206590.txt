You have to outdamage the pet.
pet does 70% damage, you do 10%, break charm, charm same or new pet, pet
kills target.

Damage: 10% you, 20% pet, 70% unassigned. Pet eats gobs of xp
pet does 60% damage, you do 25%, break charm, charm same or new pet, pet
kills target.

Damage: 25% you, 15% pet, 60% unassigned. You get it all.

At least that's how it appears to work to me. And how it used to work when
the pet got 50%  if it did more than 50% of the damage. Unassigned damage is
treated as it never happened. Like you were engaging a mob that had killed
it's attacker with 30% health left, or had been mem blurred.
