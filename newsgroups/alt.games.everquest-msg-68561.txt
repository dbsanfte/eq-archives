You don't even have to do this much. I'm on FV as well and lost my
slate and cloak.  I just went to Mignah, got a new slate.  Then I went
to the registrar and gave her the slate.  She gave me the letter for
the king.  I went to the king, gave him the letter, and he stamped it
for me.  I went back to the registrar, gave her the letter and the
slate, and she gave me my personalized slate and whatever you need to
give to the BL guildmaster.  I gave it to him and he gave me a new
cloak.  Was able to do the quests again.

Where I"m screwed now, though, is that at level 8 I get the TLC
messages whenever I kill the young rockhoppers, so I don't think I can
get any more claws.
