Glad to hear it, I might check out EQ again this summer just to see
how things have developed. ... I'm starting to get the 'itch' again.
<g> 

How hard are (shaman) spells to get these days? The 'final nail in the
coffin' as it were, for me in EQ was the lack of spells. I could
handle the grind to 70 but I just couldn't motivate myself to go back
after that and grind the spells that I'd need to be viable at high
levels. Just as I was hitting that barrier, WoW came out. So, for a
non-raider, has that changed any? 

Rgds, Frank
