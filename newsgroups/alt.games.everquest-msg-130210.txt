So I ran up to Qeynos to kill me some gnolls.  Faction, y'know, and of 
course, I need that damn brewer's cask (I HATE the brewer!  HATE HATE 
HATE!  Haven't seen one yet, although I did get one Gnoll Commander who 
hated me very much).  Anyway.  It's fairly late at night, and there 
aren't many people around.  I do a /who and get me and one other person.  
Anonymous.  So (name removed to protect the stupid/liar):

[Wed Jul 10 03:02:39 2002] You told , 'excuse me for bothering you, but 
are you able to bind, and if so may I donate for a bind just inside the 
Qeynos zone line?'
[Wed Jul 10 03:02:47 2002] tells you, 'no i cannot'
[Wed Jul 10 03:02:51 2002] tells you, 'only myself'
[Wed Jul 10 03:03:26 2002] You told , 'sorry, I'm talking about on the 
Qeynos side of the zone, not the Qeynos Hills side'
[Wed Jul 10 03:03:33 2002] It begins to rain.
[Wed Jul 10 03:03:38 2002] tells you, 'i can only bind myself you need a 
necro'
[Wed Jul 10 03:03:52 2002] You told , 'any caster class can bind....'
[Wed Jul 10 03:04:30 2002] tells you, 'well even if that is so and i am 
not sure it is i am camping a spawn right now'
[Wed Jul 10 03:04:43 2002] You told , 'okay then. thanks.'
[Wed Jul 10 03:05:00 2002] You told , 'but trust me, anybody with bind 
affinity can bind anybody else in a town zone.'
[Wed Jul 10 03:05:09 2002] tells you, 'if you say so.'

*sigh* Strange, strange chick.  What am I gonna do, steal her camp while 
she's away the 30 seconds it takes to zone, bind me, and zone back?  I 
offered another level 10 caster in BB 15 plat (everything I had on me at 
the time) to come to Qeynos and bind me right inside the zone and he 
refused and said "guess you'll have to be careful huh?"  Yeah, that's 
fantastic considering I'm encumbered, in desperate need of food and 
water and the bank, and have no idea what my reception is gonna be like 
if I step foot into town (I had a human SK there who wasn't well liked 
either, I thought perhaps they'd be even less happy to see a DE there)

Yeah, great.  Blah.  I wish newbs were as broke as *I* remember being.  
I found out later the chick who 'can only bind herself' was a druid high 
enough level to 'port to most locations for donation'.  ::headshake:: So 
either she was lying and paranoid about losing her camp in the middle of 
the night when I had been doing /who for the last ten minutes without 
seeing a sign of anyone in zone, or she was incredibly stupid for her 
level.

Anyone?


Ryou
(got lucky on the third try and found someone near my own level willing 
to bind for free, so nyah, bastard lowbie and freak druid!)
