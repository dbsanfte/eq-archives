Whats built into your M/B?  I had a similar problem when I reformatted my HD
a while back and it turned out I hadnt installed AGP drivers...  Another
time it was due to not re-updating the onboard soundcard drivers.  Basically
both times were me not having the right M/B drivers either installed or
updated, so start there as a suggestion.
