Yes, all game programs have bugs.

No, they do NOT have the same magnitude of bugs.  Some games are
buggier than others.  That is such a truism that it amazes me that I
even have to state it, or that anyone would argue about it.

When I played EQ, it was not unusual to run into bugs.  In WoW, I
rarely run into bugs.  Apparently in Vanguard, at least upon release,
the bugs were so numerous that it required an act of will to keep
playing despite them.
