I would never say such a thing. There are probably lots of nice people
in dreadlands at any one time.

But the general tendancy of people brought up through the ill omen -
fm - ot - dl run is that they *suck*. All those zones are easy. Very,
very easy. There is never any trouble with adds, repops, or blown
pulls (if anyone has those in THOSE zones avoid like the plague!).
Then at 50 they think they are da bomb and head to zones that give
good experience at that level - almost all indoor dungeon fighting.
They have no dungeon skills at all. How many people do they kill
before they learn things like assist, timing repops, what not to do
while pulling, etc?

We already know the answer. We see it every day in the dungeons. Then
they get frustrated their reputation is in shambles and try to find
another outdoor easy zone to play in, but there aren't many left
(maybe one or two new luclin zones).

I'll take someone who fought their way through 40 and 45 in the old
world dungeons, ToFS, CC, echo any day of the week over someone who
powered their way through them in DL. The dungeon experienced player
will have five times the skill.
