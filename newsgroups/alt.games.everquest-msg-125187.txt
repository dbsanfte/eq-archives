Neither are worth the vendor price, but yes it is worth it. Unless you find
slow leveling to be a plus, you will level ~9% faster with the faster
weapon. It also converts close losses to wins if you have a good weapon.

IMO: Fine steel weapons were priced buy/sell from vendors at terrible rates
to encourage a player economy: It didn't work as such, it encouraged
leveling. The 'combine' weapons like a combine scimitar are better buys from
the gypsy camps with the same damage/delays and can hit magic only monsters.
