The number of players on each server is stable or falling.  The number
of really new players is almost certainly falling.  Items, once looted,
rarely leave circulation.  As people level up, more and more better
items are being tossed into the economy.

Supply increases, demand decreases.  Prices drop until they reach
a point where demand increases enough to cover supply.  Welcome
to the free market.

This is all quite natural, and I don't particularly see it as a problem
per se.

One man's recession is another mans opportunity.  I can sell my
items to people playing new characters, and buy items from
people who's higher level characters have looted new ones.

At the bottom of this pyramid, some items will have fallen out
of favor to the point where they are sold to vendors, and thus
leave the economy.  Take fine steel weapons, for example, you'll
hardly find anyone using them any more, they are vendor loot,
as for the same price you can get velium weapons, which have
the same stats but will hit magic creatures such as the oft hunted
wisp.

Why should we care what our uber droppable items are "worth"?
If we are using them, then it hardly matters whether they are
worth 2 coppers or 2 million platinum.  If we are selling them, its
because we have better.... and if the selling price on our item
has dropped, its a good bet that the item we want to buy has
also dropped in price.

The market is indeed not stable... but I fail to see this as a crisis.

If you really want to amuse yourself, look at the "going price" on
the Stien of Muggok.  Once upon a time this went for over 200pp,
then it dropped down to around 150pp as the quest became
well known.  Then people started creating characters specifically
to do the quest, and flooded the market.  Prices dropped down
to under 50pp.  People stopped doing the quest, it simply wasn't
worth their time.  Gradually the price has gone back up to the
point where every day or two you'll see someone auctioning
WTB Stien of Muggok 200pp.
