I can't give you a whole lot in the way of specific tips, my only
Druid char is L25 and needs to start grouping so I can learn moree
specifics myself.  What I do know is that a skilled grouping Druid
can make a huge difference in the effectiveness of a group (much
like the even rarer skilled grouping Necro).  You can, depending on
group composition and where you are fighting, be much better at
crowd control than a Paladin or Cleric (often pressed into that
role when no Enchanter about), in an outdoor zone with room to
move I've seen a Druid pick-up and kite a train that was dumped on
the group along with several adds, circling near the group so that
we could pick off and kill individual mobs when ready, no rooter is
gonna keep 10 or so mobs under control like that and even a good
Enchanter would've had trouble when the train of 7 hit us.  Your
DS and DoTs can contribute substantial damage, your roots break
less easily than anybody else's, you can heal when necessary,
outdoors you can be a first-rate puller, Snare is a wonderful
thing, your Skin line gives you decent buffing ability at low to
mid level and you can use group-skin if mana is the limiting factor
for the group (forget STR buff unless mana is going to waste), your
resist buffs are valuable in some circumstances, you can substitute
for an off-tank in a pinch outdoors (Snare+DoT+DD+DD gets agro fast,
then you kite), Regen is often valuable, if trains are a frequent
occurence you can keep the group SoW'd in an outdoor zone, ...

And those are just the things I can think of off the top of my head.
I'm certain there're more, I am usually too preoccupied with my own
responsibilities to observe other group members closely during a
fight, but I've seen Druids have a huge impact on a group, more
often outdoors than inside, but even a couple times indoors as well.
The key is to be alert, try new tactics from time to time (and work
with them until you know whether they're good, bad, or indifferent),
keep an eye on all your groupmates so you see problems when they
start to happen instead of not realizing there's trouble until the
leader starts shouting "EVAC!".  Making a big difference in a
support role is usually about getting as many of the little things
right as possible, no single detail is likely to be make or break,
but taken all together people will see a huge difference between
when you are there and when you are not.
