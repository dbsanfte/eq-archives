It has not been confirmed for tradeskills.  A fair amount of testing by
various tradeskill type folks has led them to believe that the cap is in the
range of 252-255.  As I recall, it has been confirmed for the Meditate
skill, that the cap, with enchancement item(s) is 252, and that has led to
speculation that the same cap is applied to tradeskills.
