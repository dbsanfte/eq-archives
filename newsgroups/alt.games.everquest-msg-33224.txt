Thanks for the spelling tips. I'll be sure to spell check on this ng from
now on (although spell check likely won't catch those mistakes). Now for the
quests, I have done exactly as stated and it doesn't seem to work. Sometimes
I'll get a second 'paragraph' with more [words], but it has never gone
beyond that.
Thx.
