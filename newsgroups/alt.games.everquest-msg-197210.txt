By all means, count me in the number of people who have deemed you
clueless.  I know we're up to at least 6 now.  You're working on being
the first person to actually make my killfile! 

As for *your* argument here, you have much more information at your
disposal when casting votes than you do when talking about EQ-related
subjects, particularly those that YOU'VE NEVER EVEN SEEN TAKE PLACE AT
ALL.  You can look at a politicians political and often personal
history.  You can look at how they've voted on past issues, you have a
wealth of propaganda concerning their party's platform.  What do you
have from EQ?  A tactical layout of an encounter that requires
near-flawless execution from properly geared people of the proper levels
and classes?  Hardly enough to form the conclusions you're making.

No, it really is obvious that you don't have a clue.  You had no idea of
the mechanics of the trials even.  Yet you won't simply admit that your
theory of "with enough cohesion and loyalty and weeks of /play time,
everybody in a guild can be flagged!" is utter crap.  You keep arguing
even though your perceptions are fundamentally flawed and everybody is
telling you as much.

No really, you have no idea what it takes.

Not gonna happen.  30 minute timer is so that the executioner's corpse,
along with any leftover marks, rots.  Also, people usually fail the
trials.  So pushing more failures through in the same ammount of time
yields the exact same results: nobody gets a flag.

Yet you're *not* qualified to comment on it.  Even if you aren't grossly
misinformed, your perception of the information is very very flawed. 
All your posts here are about as useful as images from the Hubble before
its perception of the universe around it was corrected.

I assure you, you're going to get a *vast* minority of people who have
made it through the trials.  And even so, what would this data prove? 
That uber guilds can field the players necesary to push someone through
trials?  We've already established that.  What we're discussing are the
mid-range guilds.  Guilds with some people flagged but half or even more
that aren't.  You don't see guilds where everybody is flagged
complaining about the trials. 

You're also forgetting a very serious component to trial completion: 
gear.  Tack on another question: what was your guild farming on a regular 
basis when you got your flag?

Here's your fundamental flaw.  You're sure of something that just isn't
true.  The problem is that the vast majority of guilds *can't* field 5
players that can make it through a trial without the 6th doing their
fair share of the damage.  What do you suggest then? 

Also note that getting your flag doesn't somehow make it such that you
are now an asset to a trials group.  Much to the contrary in fact.  Your
sub-par-as-far-as-trials-are-concerned DPS along with the fact that you
would be taking up the spot of someone with more possible DPS or someone
who could potentially get a flag out of the next run makes you a
*liability* to a trials group.

I can assure you, the first groups to make it through the trials were
far better equipped than any of the unflagged level 60s today.  Guilds
farming Vex Thal, Sleeper's Tomb, Veeshan's Peak, etc had zero problems
getting their members through the trials.  It's the mid-sized guilds who
can get their best equipped and best DPS players through the trials but
not the ones with anything less that are having the problems here.

Yes, Mr. Tank, we realize you have spent over a week /play'd the last
two months to get 4 people flagged.  Only 35 more people to go!  Oh, you
didn't want to actually enjoy the game for the next year and a half, did
you? 

Yes, you have a right to an opinion, but in the face of massive proof to
the contrary most intelligent people have been known to stop trying to
defend that opinion and not incessantly bitch about being given the
correction they asked for in the first place.  Your perceptions of the
trials and the opinions you have formed based on those perceptions are
fundamentally flawed.  Please, before you make another post on the
subject, *think* about what's been presented to you in terms of evidence
contrary to your belief that "cohesion and loyalty" are all that it
takes to get an entire guild through the trials.  Sure, for the guilds
that can field the 5 players necesary to push someone through who
wouldn't normally be able to make those are the biggest issues, but for
the vast majority of guilds having trouble getting its members flagged,
they don't fulfill that primary requirement.
