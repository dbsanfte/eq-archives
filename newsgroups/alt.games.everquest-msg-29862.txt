	Trueshot increases damage with Archery whether or not the target is
stationary.  It does not affect delay.  The damage increase is not as great as
listed in the documentation (which claims you will hit for max to twice max).
In particular it doesn't do much for your minimum hits; I have still found
myself hitting for less damage than the arrow rating (and I fire some very
expensive 6/150 arross, so that really sucks).  There was a period of about
two weeks in which the discipline performed more or less as advertised, and
actually made Rangers a sought-out class for raids against high-profile
targets like Venril Sathir and Kunark Dragons and such; since that status is
reserved for Warriors, Clerics and Enchanters the discipline was promptly
nerfed.

	There is a theory that the damage for Trueshot is related to the delay of
the bow, but it's pretty thoroughly disconfirmed.  Rangers have tried using
bows of identical delay and different damage rating and the higher-damage bows
perform better.  If there's some kind of bonus for high-delay bows it's not
very large.  Best results so far in terms of total damage have been obtained
by using bows with good ratios.  I personally break out my Bow of the Huntsman
(20/30) for Trueshot work, over my usual Bow of the Underfoot (33/60).
High-damage bows can produce some very impressive critical hits under
Trueshot, with the current record being a shot in the high 900's from an
Efreeti War Bow (wielded by Celt of the Xeb server, IIRC).  Statistically such
hits don't overcome the inferior ratios found on most such bows, making them
good for little more than impressing the "Rangers are useless" crowd.

	At L51+, Rangers get double damage with bows against stationary targets
that are not under a Root spell.  This does stack with Trueshot which helps
produce hits like that 900-pt monster just mentioned.
