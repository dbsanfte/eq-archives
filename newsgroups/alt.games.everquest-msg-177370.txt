they're a basic indicator of how long food will last when eaten normally
(ie: top food in your inventory, not right-clicked and "force fed").

the list for food goes something like:
snack, meal, enduring meal, banquet, feast, miraculous meal.  under normal
circumstances (ie, you don't eat like a vah shir, you're not on a horse and
you didn't spend (waste?) AA points on metabolism), a miraculous meal lasts
somewhere between 2-4 hours realtime.

someone correct me if i'm wrong or missed anything.
