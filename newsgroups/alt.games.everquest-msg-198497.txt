Yeah, the Tier 2 bit is telling.  One SK in our guild went from zero
Spectral spells to having all of them in a single day's Tactics pit
camp so you can understand why we chose to do that instead.

Terror Matriarch is THE mob I can think of that I tried and failed to
pull most often.   I easily tried a dozen times to get her to come
and either ended up back at the Hedge [*] without her but WITH lots
of other junk or proc-feigned somewhere inbetween.

[*] We were waiting in vain for the hedge NPC to actually work and
port us inside instead of whining about how he was tired so it was a
fairly ludicrous long range pull that I wouldn't have attempted
otherwise.
