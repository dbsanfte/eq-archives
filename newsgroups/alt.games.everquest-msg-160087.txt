    ME is actually a pain in the rump, in terms of drop rate. If you're just
doing XP and having fun, though, it's pretty easy and some of the drops off
the named Gorangas are really nice (Divine Inspiration, the shoulders off
the Battlemaster). And you get lots of acrylia for your tailoring friends!

    Crawled? You go to the gateway to the city, which is a short hop into
the zone and reachable by invis. Where were you camping the shards?

    If you know the way, nothing along the route to the basement sees
through Invis. This is by design. You need to be a bit cautious going
through the arch to get to the mines, because of the wandering Taskmasters
that do see through, but it was the sort of run even a cleric like myself
could do.
