I feel for you, did that camp myself for my cleric. Everytime that stupid
putrid skeleton spawned I wanted to just hit the monitor. Had my wizard
bound there to help with the kill and the day I finished the quest there was
the live one up again so my friend brought his 13th lvl cleric over and we
got that part. Couple days ltr he logs in cleric to gate him out and the
dead one was up so his 13th lvl cleric had the AoL. Just made me wanna puke,
lol. Took me 4 days of setting the alarm clock to make sure i was always
awake for the spawn.
