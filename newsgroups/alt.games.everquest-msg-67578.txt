From Abit's Web site www.abit-usa.com

KA7
Chipset
VIA VT8371(KX133) /VIA 686A

You "DEFINATELY" need the Via4in1 drivers, as well as the SBLive!
compatibility patch.

Also it looks like you may be running the original Athlon (Slot A).
Verant has stated that there is a "floating point" issue with the
original Athlon and Durn chips that they are working on fixing. I am
not sure what the symptoms of this problem are. You may have to go to
the EverQuest support site and do a little digging.

Cheers
