I had similar trouble when I first downloaded a few from EQAtlas. I 
couldn't see anything when I opened them in game.

It turned out the colours they had used to draw the maps where so light 
a hue as to be invisible with my gamma settings.

I open the maps in mappie = light blue / light green lines

Open them in game = Invisible

I cured it by making them all dark almost black colours in Mappie

Came up as Light Green and Blue in game. result I could use them.

As a side note.

When I tried compressing the game given maps using mappie to cut memory 
space and increase loading speed. EQ Just downloaded the originals back 
over the top of the compressed maps :(
