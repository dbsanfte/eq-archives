I use different addresses for everything I do, one of the advantages of
running your own domain <g>.  The th@... address I use here is only used
here, but normally munged.  I accidentally have posted here twice that I
recall with it unmunged and to this day still receive spam at that
address.  Unless someone who didn't enjoy my posts decided to make an
effort to get me on a spammers list I can only assume this group does
indeed get botted upon occasion.  I'll keep masking.

On a similar note... I've found that if I am filling out a registration
and supply Company X with my email address as companyxspam@<my domain>
they never sell my name to spammers for some odd reason.  Not sure if
its assumed to be an invalid address or they really don't want their
name associated with the companies they sell addresses to, but hey, it
works <g> and I still get update notices and the like from the actual
vendor.
