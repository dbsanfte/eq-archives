Arafat is a terrorist.  Arafat has been a terrorist for a very long time.
Arafat is not a prime example of a muslim.  The issue is not the religion,
that is what I am trying to get across here.  The issue is with the people
who are involved, who happen to have been raised in a muslim environment.
The religion is being perverted, and used as the reason for the acts that
are being committed.  In reality, the acts are being committed because the
people involved have no hope, and do not see any way to resolve the
situation.  The conditions that they live in are such that it makes them
prepared to accept the things that they are taught to believe.  If the
socio-economic condition of the people involved was significantly better, I
believe that you would find a lot less willing vollunteers.  There will
always be radicals in any society, ours included, but, generally, they are a
small minority.  Don't misunderstand me, I do not in any way condone any
type of terrorism, and I don't believe that any terrorsist should be allowed
to continue living.  What I object to is people painting all Muslims with
the same brush.  And, not that it's of any real relevance here, I am not,
and have never been a Muslim.
