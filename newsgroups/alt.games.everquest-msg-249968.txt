A) It wouldn't be tied into a credit card.. it would come out of your
gaming account at the bank through the game.
B) If you transfer him money from your account.. that means he has one
of his own. As such.. he had to show two forms of identification to
open it and will be working off an encryption method which the bank
programs can use to get ID verification before the transfer. It really
has the same physical security as your normal ATM card, but better,
along with a pin system we are familiar with. The digital security is
tied in to how hard it is to brute-force break an encryption system.

Once again.. no credit card bill... account balance. The nice part is
you can request an account report in game and it can just send you a
.pdf file that you print on your printer.

Due to defect sure. Does that really apply here? An item will have the
same characteristics no matter how many iterations of it you have. And
you could certainly supply a receipt for the transfer that lists terms
of purchase along with putting a link in the transfer window so the
buyer can check them before he buys.

Part of the setting up of his account is explaining that it is for his
use only.. and he is liable for any charges he lets anyone else ring
up by transferring his identity to them. If he wants to get his son a
gaming account, he should do just that and then transfer as much money
as he wants the kid to have from his account to the kids in game. It
would certainly be a better way of moderating how much money the kid
has access to then giving him his credit card.
