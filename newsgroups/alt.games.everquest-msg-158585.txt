I tend to agree with you, but Eh...  Everyone is entitled to their own
opinions.  I still remember getting caught between Icelady and Little
WhiteDove in the UONG.  I knew and liked them both, but there wasn't any way
those two were ever going to get along.

If he wants to believe bizbee's a creep, it's his prerogative.  I'm sure it
doesn't bother bizbee in the slightest, so why should we get our underwear
in a bunch over it?  Go on about is too much and everyone will start
weighing in on one side or the other, flames will start, bizbee STILL won't
care, but everyone will be mad at each other...

<shrug> So, it's his opinion, let him have it...
