Get with a pet class of similar level and duel them, then beat on thier pet
for the skill ups.  Although they have pets, enchanters are not much good
for this, as their pets run wild like spoiled children.  Mages are what you
need.  Or Necros, probably.  I have no idea the level of control a
beastmaster has over his or her pet, so I don't know if one of them could
help you.

Anyway, the gist is that, while you cannot get skill ups from duelling a PC,
pets are NPCs and will give skill ups.
