There are few players grouped in CR (but that is expected since it is the 
starter zone), and fewer in the next zone - Blightfire Moor.  In all the 
time I've hunted there from 8 to 44 I have never seen an /ooc lfg.  I've had 
few responses to my lfg's, maybe 5 in all.  Most of them were 1 person 
reasonable level + 1 person powerleveling him.  It really isnt like the old 
days, and nothing like the "re-release" that they hoped for.
