Partially true. They have reversed the decision, but the 
uninstaller is still pending. What they previously called an 
uninstaller, in reality made the installed files visible, 
but went further than the original by sending info to a Sony 
server. The ActiveX component required for this left your 
system wide open to virus writers. They are also making 
people mail in CD's for a replacement, at the customer's 
expense apparently. Nice!
