I actually expect things to fuck up like this, and on this scale after all
the previous online game type things I've seen (not necessarily played) such
as UO, EQ, AC, WW2Online, AO (horrid reviews) and even single player games
really bugger up now too (POR2 for example).

While I am not happy with all these glitches etc. in the game, I now have
come to expect them in all games of this scale and in the back of my mind I
know that the team is likely working on correcting the issues.

So basically, I don't care if that person (or any other for that matter)
toss it in.
