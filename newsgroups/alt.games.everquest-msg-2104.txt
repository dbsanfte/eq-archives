If you like grouping you can kill orcs and gnolls in Highpass for a
couple levels. Very fast spawns, in a good group you can hit 20 in an
evening. Orcs start greening around 21, though I have seen players
stay for an extra level or two hoping for a rare equipment drop. From
there you can head to Southern Karana/Lake Rathe for Aviaks, Lake of
Ill Omen, Warsliks Woods, or the Estate of Unrest to name a few. LOIO
is probably the most popular, most servers have more than 100 players
in there at a time, but they go because the exp is great.
