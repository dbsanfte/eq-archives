I'm level 60 and have 292 unused practice points. Basically you need only
used a single point within a skill or tradeskill to kick-start it. These
skills will then raise quickly enough as it is through practice! Admittedly
these points are useless to me at the moment, but my guess is that some way
down the road Sony will introduce new skills to EverQuest, so they might be
handy later on.

Don't worry about spending them, these points require cash to use too, so
it's not like you're really getting anything for free.

Kind regards ...

Stevie.
