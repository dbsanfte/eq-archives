I haven't used Call of Karana all that much, but it hasn't given me
too many problems. I don't have Tunare's Request but am in no rush to
get it - my pet beaver would probably get jealous if I perma charmed a
greenie instead of summoning him. 
On the other hand, I intend to have some fun with Dire Charm one day.
