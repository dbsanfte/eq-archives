sebilis is an appropriate level zone for all high level characters . zol
knights drop cobalt arms as a rare . kor shamans drop the sebilisian
beserker cloak as a rare. Dar knights drop the obdulous death shroud as a
rare. All 3 of these frog types can easily be green to someone in a normal
sebilis party . It is not at all unusual now to see that sebilis party with
a range of levels from 45-60 and thats the way it should be . But under tcc
that group no longer gets loot from those 3 frog types .

The exact same thing happens in karnors with all of the mob rare drops.
Permafrost has level 12 mobs, permafrost has level 55 mobs, permafrost has
mobs at many levels between the 2. Such things are not even mistakes, but
they will punish the hell out of you anyway. It is hard enough to get a
pickup group now, you really dont want to see group looking for a level 53
tank .

Low level characters are in the habit of asking for help from higher level
characters . Whether this is morale , good, or bad for the game is a ethics
question and one I am not trying to make (well ok I kinda look down on them
too :p). You seem to want to argue whether it is a good reason or not when I
am arguing whether it is a reason many low level characters will perceive it
as harm to themselves .

You may also have missed the point that if the higher levels leave then
capital for investment in more content is also reduced.
