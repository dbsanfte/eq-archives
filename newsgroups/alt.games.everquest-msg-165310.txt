It'll Proc at level 30 just like the 2hs equivalent, Icereaver.

It's a bit slow and the Damage is wasted on a lvl 3, your damage is capped
to about 20 at <10th and 30 at <20th level.
If you're looking to practice with an effective 2hb look for the fastest
available, any damage over 16 will be wasted until you pass 20th.
Unfortunately I can't think of anything decent off the top of my head.

I would learn as many weapon skills as possible, it's easier now than it
will be later.
Problem is that lvls 1-10 fly past so fast now that you find even your most
used skill, 1hs, will be lagging behind.
I would suggest learning piercing as well, especially as the best budget
weapon available for under 20's is a piercer, the Centi War Spear, it'll
cost you about 10pp now days.

Quick look at Allakhazams hasn't given me any better suggestions so you
might as well stick with it for 2hb but the Runic Carver will give you
better damage output.
