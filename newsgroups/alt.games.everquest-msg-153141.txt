  Seems to me you're trying to switch debates. The original point was
that Druids/Rangers didn't receive an intermediate reward. Whether or
not they would use it, or for how long, is totally irrelevant to the
original point.

 It probably would have been a lot easier to just come out and admit
that there were intermediate rewards you just weren't aware of them.
