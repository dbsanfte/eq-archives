Yes, I know.  I said I was bound in the bank itself.  To reply to
someone else, it takes me a lot more than 10 seconds to get into
the bank from the soulbinder, if only because it takes me several
seconds of mashing my keyboard just to get past all the lag and
start moving at all.  (Lag in PoK got a LOT worse with all the
pets running around, sigh.)

But my main point is a bit more general: that it's real easy for
all you casters to say "just change your bind point" when it's no
big deal for you to change it back when you're done.  (I actually
have no idea which caster classes can Bind; sure seems like most
of them.)
