Excuse me?  Are you on c2 or just dense?  First of all, items stack
with spells or songs, not both.  (Well, disregarding the Ervaj songs,
which are all but useless without an epic, and not much use then
either.)  Swift Like the Wind is a 60% haste item, the haste cap
pre-60 is 80%.  A FBSS will put you at the haste cap.  You lose about
1% of your total fitzing AC, that means that the cleric has to drop
one more heal on you every 50 battles or so.  Of course you are now
doing about 12.5% MORE damage all the time, which means that every
fight is over faster, maybe only 3% faster if you're one of 4 tanks,
but it's still a lot more than the 1% AC you lose.

I don't know about that, would you turn down a 12.5% AC upgrade?  How
about a 12.5% pay raise?  You lose a small amout of AC with an FBSS,
and since even a bard can easily sit well above the 1000AC soft-cap,
even in resist gear, a real tank should never have to worry about
this.

If you're trying to taunt something off of the enchanter, you want to
hit it often, and 12.5% more often is significant.  If you are such a
gimp that you can't take 10 seconds of being beaten on while the
enchanter gets things under control, you have much, much bigger
problems.  You are only giving up 1% of you AC, that is not worth
stressing over.  Instead of being hit for 44, you'll be hit for 45,
big freakin' deal!

They you're an idiot, and should stay in Dreadlands or wherever the
hell else you leveled up.  If you have multiple mobs, you want them on
the main tank, the cleric can keep one tank alive easily, even if they
have to drop celestial, celestial, cheal, cheal.  If you're beating on
another one, the enchanter/bard mezzes, you break it, the
enchanter/bard tries again, then realizes you're an idiot and moves
onto mezzing the next one.  Of course since you can't draw any
reasonable aggro because you want that extra 1% of AC, it's quite
possible the 2 broken mezzes dropped on the mob have aggrod it on your
CC'er.  If all the melee classes are on one mob, and they're doing
good damage, and all the adds are attacking the main tank, the CC can
mez and position them without worrying about it being broken, the
healer can concentrate on healing the main tank, and by the time stuff
is mezzed, you're usually on the 2nd or 3rd mob already.
I have fought just about everywhere, and other than unmezzable mobs,
the last thing I want to see is tanks on two different mobs.  OK,
other than an SK pulling an add off with a DOT.  Just because you can
get away with something doing the corner in KC doesn't mean it's a
good idea.
