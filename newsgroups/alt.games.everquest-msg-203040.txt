<<<<<<<Haven't you figured that out yet?

You're still responding to my every post, just as you'll respond to this
piece of bait ... so I guess not.

Nice try!!  Now you'll try to make it look like I'm foolish if I continue to
respond to your posts because you're "baiting me".  Sorry, I'm smarter than you
are and that won't work.  Just answer the question and I'll be gone.  You still
can't.  You still won't.
