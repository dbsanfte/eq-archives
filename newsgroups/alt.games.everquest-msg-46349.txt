I agree, I'd play the female vah shir. Really its one of the better
looking default newb look models. It will probably look pretty good
with armor on. I'm pretty happy with it after the "female" iksar = /

That reminds me.. wonder if they would be even changing the iksar
model for luclin since it basically came out with kunark and was sort
of more complex anyway.
