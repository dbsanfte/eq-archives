He means the server here. There's a server called Firiona Vie which is a
roleplaying preferred server (meaning we try to limit OOC, or Out Of
Character, stuff), where very, very little is nodrop. Augmentations that are
nodrop everywhere else are not nodrop here and can be sold and/or traded, as
can any items that have the augmentations in them. Augmentations can have
restrictions of race, class, level (called 'season' on Firiona Vie), deity,
etc., and impart those restrictions to any item they augment. So if you
alt-click or hold down the right mouse button over the item, check to see if
the item slot has an augmentation in it. :)

However, looking back over your posts, you say which servers you're on, and
Firiona Vie isn't one of them, so that's all moot. :)
