It *is* possible.  My online name for ages in the past was Raen, a
name I had made up a long time ago entirely on my own, long before I
ever ran into a character of the same name in Robert Jordan's series.

There is presumably only a finite number of pseudo-Celtic,
nice-sounding names that have never been used before floating out
there in the Great Name Pool and the number is diminishing daily.

Frightening, when you think about it.
