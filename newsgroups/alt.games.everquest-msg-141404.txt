I posted a few days ago about raiding in Kael as a tag-along raid with a
guild that I was interesting in joining. Well, all went great, I got my
guild invite and had a great time at the raid.  The next day we even did
Chardok king & queen and all was successful.  Now, my new question is, can
the Thurg quest armor drop from the giants on the way to the arena?  There
is about a dozen giants on the way there that are green/light blue to me so
would be easy to do by myself or even better with my brother's warrior to
partner with.  I'd like to get some of this armor for myself without having
to drag a whole raid there.  Any ideas?

Thanks in advance.
