Sneak and Hide ONLY have a chance to increase skill when it's FIRST used, when
the button is down it doesn't continue to go up in skill like meding does. 

As for FD, i dunno

Swimming goes up while your moving in the water, not sure if it goes up by
being still in the water because I never had the reason to try it! But you HAVE
to be under water, where your air bar is showing!
