Funny, just this past weekend I made an Erudite Necro and ran him to Qeynos.
Had to go throught he sewers to get through Qeynos safely, but it wasn't that
hard.  I hadn't killed a single thing yet when I did this, so maybe you
wrecked your faction somehow, or did you bother to check?  Everyone in Erudin
was dubious to me, nothing was KoS that I saw (could even use the bank).
