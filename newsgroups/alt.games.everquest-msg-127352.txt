I've done some research on VS faction and I've never heard of a cap that low
for any race/class/deity.  I've also heard of plenty of good races doing the
quest so I'm 95% sure you can get to amiable with enough braids.

Unless it was changed recently that should work, but I've heard the undead
foreman has really high MR.  Charming and doing the faction work are pretty
much your only options.  AoN does not affect faction.
