In my previous post, I agreed (more or less) with these statements.
Now that I think about it, I'm not so sure. I think that, as a 36th
level Warrior, that I could wipe the floor with the pet of a 36th
Magician. If the Magician was helping, yeah, the pet/Mage combo would
probably win.

Though I've never actually tested it, I find it very hard to believe
that a pet from a comparable leveled mage is doing "a great deal more
damage" than I am. If I had to guess, I would say the pet is doing
between 1/4 and 1/2 the damage that I am. Add the Mage to this, and
you may be right - for short bursts. I never run out of mana.

I'm gonna try to find a 36 Magician to duel and get back to you on the
results. I'll try fighting just the pet with no interference from the
Mage. If I win, I'll take on both the Mage and his pet.
