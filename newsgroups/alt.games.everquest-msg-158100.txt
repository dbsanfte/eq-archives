Actually, that's not what I meant, but I've been holding back my frustration
at the druid bashing for so long, I did let that message turn into a bit of
a rant, so I'll accept and apologize for this impression.

I was TALKING about all those that jump into any discussion about druids and
scream and holler.  The ones I'm talking about ceased to be reasonable on
the subject withing five minutes of finding out that a Druid could do
something they couldn't.  They fail to look into the details, they just
bash.

These people are the ones that aren't INTERESTED in talking about it,
understanding the other's point of view, they the ones that say "Good they
deserve it!" to ANYTHING done to the Druids, and scream at VI for favoring
us if they so much as fix a bug in one of our spells.

They were EVERYWHERE in Whineplay back in the day, it was the standard
mindset of most of the posters there.  There were quite a few of them here
too, when I left awhile back, although not near the level of Whineplay.

THOSE are the people I was talking about.

Ok, how about you back off that a bit and discuss this rationally?

I've apologized for the false impression I gave.  If this stemmed from that
impression, then I will apologize again.
