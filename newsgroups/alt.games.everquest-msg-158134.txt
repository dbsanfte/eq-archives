However, by your definition, anyone that held their ground versus common
opposition would be a whiner.   I'm not so sure that's a good definition.

Still, I accept that I have been most adamant on the issue, even though I
have conceded  points and discussed it reasonably for the most part.

I dont' know if my viewpoint is right or wrong, I just know I believe it
right, and while I've found the debate educational, I haven't been convinced
otherwise yet.

I also know that anyone that doesn't follow a majority opinion would always
be a Whiner by your definition, and in that case I don't MIND being called a
Whiner.
