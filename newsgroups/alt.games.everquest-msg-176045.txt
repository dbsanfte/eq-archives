Here is my promise to you as a chosen emissary of God:

If I am allowed to complete my prophecy as I wish then the Silicon =
Valley will continue to flourish, the Oakland Raiders will win the Super =
Bowl 3 consecutive years in a row as they will be God's chosen team =
which cannot be defeated unless they wish for whatever reason.

If I am imprisoned unjustly, or I do not see my messages appearing on =
these 7 newsgroups which I have chosen, then the Silicon Valley will be =
razed

It will not rain either way and the water may soon become as blood as I =
prayed for it to become as I sat alone in my prison cell with 2 felony =
terrorist counts sitting over my head for writing e-mail, no matter how =
heinous sounding they may have been, they were still only e-mail, which =
are only written words expressing emotions, which are considered the =
most dangerous of all things by the anti-christ, both words and =
emotions, but most of all emotions being expressed with words.
