These "uber guilds" are for the most part the ones who've been around the
longest, and have been the most loyal customers.  Their leaving is just an
indication that people who have put a lot of time into the game are
beginning to get frustrated with the game.  Whether or not you like their
company, they are the ones who first explore new high level content, and
spend endles deaths and CR's in the process of fighting the newest uber mob,
so that in a few months, you can copy their strategy and kill the mob
yourself.
