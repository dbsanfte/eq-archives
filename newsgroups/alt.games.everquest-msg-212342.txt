As a small aside, at least an SK can get and keep agro consistently over
a combo of the more popular and agro weapons short of BoW, BF, HG, BoC, etc.
Scenario was xp in PoV desert vs. golems, spiders, crawlers.  
Me, 65 War, using CHSD+CHoS (Cord Handled Spike Driver and Copper Hammer of
Smiting) also tested out GSoT (Great Staff of Thunder).  SK was 65 using
IIRC Windblade and just spells.  GSoT would sometimes get mob to turn and
smack me a couple times before turning back on the SK on a proc.  
CHSD/CHoS didn't seem to annoy the critters nearly as much, and didn't
subjectively seem to generate any more agro than my usual "DPS" setup of
Horror Shard Claw + Splitblade of Destruction.  I'd imagine that a reasonably
played Pally can lock agro just as easily as the SK did.
