  We'll see.  One of the benefits to switching to the DX8.1 engine was
because it was supposedly more efficient and would offer "better
performance".  So far we're definitely not seeing that, at least not
on my lower end machine.  I've had a performance decrease of at least
100% in some areas because of the new engine.  Maybe it's because the
new engine is buggy, or maybe it's because it's coded to overly rely
on features sported by more advanced hardware.
