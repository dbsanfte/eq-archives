It doesn't "go" anywhere.   It's just a place they believe was designed
to accommodate a zone line, such as (in this case) a tunnel with a turn
that goes nowhere and (usually) doesn't have a "camp" in it.   When
you travel through a new zone, it's fairly obvious when you've found a
zone line even before you zone, right?  Same thing here, except
the actual zone on the other side hasn't been implemented yet (and
may never be.)

Shadeweaver's Thicket is another Luclin zone with an obvious zone
line which leads nowhere, for example.  The Hole is another zone
with a zone line that doesn't go anywhere (to the Plane of Underfoot,
supposedly.)

As a guess, they wanted to add another couple of zones (at least) to
Luclin, but couldn't get them done in time, such as a higher-level
dungeon off of Netherbian Lair.   So the connecting tunnel is there
but the zone is missing.
