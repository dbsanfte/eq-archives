I'm sorry, but I'll cast SoW how I please.  It is not my job to
support your tradeskills.  I don't expect people to stop selling armor
just so I can make money once I finally max out my Tailoring skill.

Just be happy that you can make something back from your tradeskill.
The vast majority of trades will never get the tradesman back a
fraction of what they spend getting the skill up.
