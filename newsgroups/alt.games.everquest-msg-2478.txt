For a spell to drop of a given level, the monster in question needs to also
be a certain level to drop it. Most of the high level spells typically only
drop from juggernauts in sebilis, or the high level wurms/drakes in
skyfire, or similar places. Maybe this means that the post 50 shaman dots
will now exist on servers in larger quantities than the epic weapon.
