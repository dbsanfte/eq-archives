I don't agree with this on a couple of levels. Mostly, if you go back a
couple of years in the newsgroup you will find there was a much more anti
twinking bias when the game first came out.

The newsgroup population has changed to reflect the same changes as occured
in the game. Right now, high levels camping low level spawns and twinking
are kings. This is fine, nice that the game appeals to this market segment.
The twink market segment's $9.89/month is just as good as anyone elses. It
helps finance expansions and content.

Some of the recent changes appealed widely to the existing user base. I mean
when the game first came out, I remember a lot of people debating things
like if the mino axe was an uber weapon or "Should I upgrade from leather to
rawhide?"

Now you have tons of new magic drops and player made items that are only
available through high level characters and twinking. This has made soloing,
exp, and taking down tough mobs much easier with the caveat "As long as you
are twinked".

NOTHING has been done for the true newbie. Hold onto this as it is my major
point. It sucked hard 2 years ago being a newb, it sucks just as hard now.
While the people who LEAST needed it got tons of items and zones added to
the game, the true newbie got shit.

The game was made easier for us as experienced players, no two ways about
it. To say that VI shouldn't attempt to make the game appeal to a wider
market by having new players able to effectively twink themselves via TCC is
just plain self centered. Granted they will screw it up, but that isn't the
point.

For my money, a new player that can get decent items via the TCC is much
more justified in having them then another player who twinks his level 1
with his level 50. I'm also of the position that twinking is justified.
Imagine how someone who feels twinking in any form is wrong.

You have to follow UO for example of this working. They created a newbie
garden. Advanced players can't even *enter* one of the frigging places. Milk
and honey flow freely. They added 50,000 new accounts!

Since Designer Dragon is now working for VI, you have to assume they got
both the info and the numbers from him.

Never underestimate the ability of a marking type to lick his finger and
hold it into the air to see which way the wind blows.
