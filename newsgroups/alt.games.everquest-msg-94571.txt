>>> Just a thought, as I haven't played my gnome necro for a while, but is
it possible to get him to Luclin and actually survive there? Are any of the
zones mainly evil-aligned or is it all goody-two-shoes stuff? <<<


I haven't had too much problems there, but I haven't been everywhere yet. No
one in Nexus, Bazaar, Shadow Haven will attack you. I walked around Shar Val
with no problems, everything was dubious IIRC. The mobs in Paludal Caverns
will attack you, but from what I can tell they attack everybody.

That's about the extent of my Luclin knowledge, so other than that, you're
pretty much on your own.
