Me too.  But always the little portables.  Started with an MZ-R55, which
stopped working and was replaced with the MZ-R90.  Recently gave it to a
friend, cuz I owed him money, and figured the R90 would cover it.  I now
have a stack of discs sitting on my bookshelf, complaining at me.  So I'm
looking at the R700 or the R900, or maybe one of the new Sharp models.
Probably go with a Sony, though, and not just because of Mr. Petition's
whining
