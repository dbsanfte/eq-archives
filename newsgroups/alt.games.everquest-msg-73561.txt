Ahahaha... uhh... tossing the ring into the mountain would end the
trilogy a bit prematurely... I guess its pretty obvious you never read
the books and really in fact know nothing about the story at all. I
really find it kind of hard to believe that anyone with the slightest
interest in fantasy or fantasy gaming has never read the one set of
works which started it all. I guess that is getting really common
though with the youth of today who probably don't read much to begin
with.

Well, you might see him again...

Tolkien was working with a wizard without a preconceived template for
the most part so he could pretty much do whatever he wanted to and
have him use a sword and such. The bridge was made of stone and quite
thick, the balrog probably could have crossed it easily had gandalf
not stopped it.

You should read at least the first book after seeing the movie. The
books are really fantastic. If you think the movie had too much hobbit
hugging though the book has a ton and a half more. The movie edits
tons of the content of the hobbits off on their own, in fact the movie
cuts out nearly all of it which is kind of a gripe I had with it.
According to the movie it seems the hobbits are on their own for about
25 seconds until they meet strider in some bar with the largest danger
being the near run in with the ringwraiths. The book is VERY
different.

Being interested in fantasy at all and never reading the lord of the
rings series by tolkien (and to a lesser degree the hobbit) is a bit
like being very interested in reading material about the
jewish/christian God or Christ yet never reading the Bible. This is
the bible of fantasy literature.
