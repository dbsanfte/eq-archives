I specifically don't want the acrylia stuff because it's got crap for saves,
like I said, I like to have my normal hunting gear have fairly decent save
on it.  Have thought about the shissar cloak though (it's down to around 2k
cause it's bloody common, whereas acrylia studded cloak is still 6k or so)

As for the stuff from umbral, that's not going to happen anytime soon.
Bracelets are still 12k (8k for a couple crappier ones, cha/dex/agi I
think), which is a big chunk of my money, and they're very low on resale
value if I upgrade (hard to sell that is).  And elysian armor isn't going to
happen, because I don't have the forces for it (or more specifically, they
hate Luclin), and umbral plains is strictly BYOG on my server.

And about Jade Reavers, it's all about profit, farmer sells one for 15k, I
buy, wait a few days for some desperate idiot to offer me 40k.  Bam, I just
made another 25k.  How do you think I made my money?  Buy high demand items
cheap, sell high.  It's not like a pegasus cloak or kedge robe where you're
selling the MQ, Jade Reavers are actually tradeable, for all I know someone
could just have too much money to spend on a twink warrior.  I've been
screwed often enough on them for my epic by farmers, I'm willing to return
the favor.
