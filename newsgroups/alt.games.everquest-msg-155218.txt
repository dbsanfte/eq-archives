For Wizards, it has to be the Familiar Enhancement spells.

These spells grant your Familiar more hitpoints and improve its run
speed.

However, Familiars themselves DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING other than flap 
around, and the buff effects bestowed have no link to the graphical
one.

If a Familiar gets killed by an AE --- so what?  THe mana regen
and everything else remains, and everyone on your raid will be
thankful. ;-)

(There used to be a time when if a Familiar died, the wizard would
take a HP hit, but that got changed a while back).

Tris,
