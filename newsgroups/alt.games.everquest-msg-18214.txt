The thing is, I totally agree with you. :)

Still, the point is that someone has to take care of the idiots, like it
or not, and I prefer it to be the state --over which we have some
semblance of control, conspiracy theories aside-- than either private
enterprise or religious organizations, which are in many cases either
financed directly by the State, or indirectly through stupendous tax
exemptions.

What got me about Hughes's post was the snide remark about leftists. I
noticed in my years in the USA that they use the words "leftist" or
"socialist" interchangeably with "baby-eating Satanist", when
ninety-nine percent of the population has never *seen* a socialist, let
alone talked to one.

From an European perspective, both the Republican and the Democratic
parties are right-wing, with the Democrats only fractionally closer to
the centre; but in Europe a character like Joseph Liebermann wouldn't be
on a Labour or Socialist party, so I found the remark about the
Democratic Party amusing. The only think that makes the Democrats
left-wing is a direct comparison with the Republicans.

As far as social policies go, nobody likes seeing useless, parasitical
leeches living on benefits and breeding like rabbits, and I think you
won't find any left-wing parties in Europe that promote that behaviour.
Hell, all over Europe, Socialist and Center-Right parties have become
absolutely indistinguishable in their policies, with only reformed
Communists, silly Greens and the odd Fascist party providing color (and
both Communists and Fascists have mellowed out so much they are
unrecognizable).

OTT: Antonious Bayle: Fascist? :-P
