Nahh, I see this a lot. They are trying to get a free powerlevel. They
whack a red until it is over half health, then run somewhere that high
levels sit, like the tunnel, yelling for help. The high level whacks
it, they get the EXP, and are usually fit to go pull another. 

I look at their health, and the mob's health. If they have enough to
survive, I snare the mob and tell them where the zone line is. IF they
truly need help, I will help them once, maybe twice. Third time I just
enjoy the show.
