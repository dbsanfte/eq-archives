Kiting envolves keeping away from a monster while leading it around like a
"kite" while doing damage to it.

Bard, Druids, Rangers, Necros, Wizards (to name a few) eventually get the
right spells, pets, etc. to let them "kite" monsters.  There are other types
of kiting too: Charm Kiting, Swarn Kiting, DoT-ing, etc. (other names exist
as well as methods).

Each class can do this in various way with spells or wepons, so each will
have methods that work for them.


The jargon will come with time...just play and ask questions.
