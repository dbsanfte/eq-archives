That makes it a stunning raid tool for rangers, and I'm amazed
nobody is screaming for them to loot this from the treetops.

Fast, Hard spell aggro is vital for weaponshield positioning and
aggro burn.

'Mob inc!'

'*snare* *flame lick* *snare* *snare* *snare* /weaponshield'

'15 seconds of more aggro building from ranger'

'AE taunt from warrior'

Warrior has ranger level aggro lock - Anything that will improve
the rangers aggro is a damned useful tool for that, and (less so)
still handy when you want to pull aggro off, i.e, the enchanter.

Shrug. I very rarely used my bow any more in groups or raids by the elemental+
level. Bow of the tempest is not that great an upgrade from the elemental
bows, but the time melee weapons are. Maybe its not that stupid... I used
to tank/melee in LDON, and many raids and fights are not archery-suitable.

That doesnt seem as utterly mind numbing as the shield, to me.
