Monks dont hate bsts at all. The two main classes that lost the family
jewels to bsts are shaman primarily and magicians secondarily..

Shamans just buff melee and slow as a principle function . Beasts do all of
that plus are better dps, tanking, and have paragone which ridiculously ups
regen and mana regen.

Beastlords are the 3rd most powerfull class (right behind clerics and bards)
It is still easy to nerf the hell out of all 3 of them to make everything
work. Give shamans and necros a real res .Make paragon a health attack buff
instead of health/mana. Make the druid wood ability the mana/health. Add a
regen componet back to nine and cabbage. Give druids equal heals with
clerics . Oh and shoot all bards :)
