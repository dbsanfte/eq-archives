Well, Jesus, you know, I had no idea that the casual use of the word
bullshit, to describe a debate tactic that can only be charitably described
as bullshit, in a usenet setting would leave you and Rumble submissively
urinating all over yourselves and crying out for your mothers.

I'm not the one being oversensitive here.

And as noted before, the self-righteousness that you've shown in these two
postings in response to me is another debate tactic that can only charitably
be described as... dubious.
