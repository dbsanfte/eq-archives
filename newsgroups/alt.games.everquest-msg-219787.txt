I started my ranger in 2000 and she's just now level 58 - first character,
untwinked.  In real life *and* in game I can take constructive critisism with a
smile and a thank you and learn from it.  And ask questions if I find someone
knowledgeable in my "job".  High level rangers are quite willing to offer good
advice that I've found invaluable.
I'm constantly amazed by the people who don't realize I have buffs, I have
damage shields, I can save a life (in a jam) with my heal spell.  And yes, I'll
take agro off the cleric / wizard / enchanter and die willingly doing it.  It
goes with the job.  I can single pull, root and snare.  Not to mention the
obvious sowing and tracking.  
I'm offended by ranger bashing too, and I can't figure out *why* either. 
Because I *know* in my heart its either joking or plain ignorance.  But it just
makes me more determined to be a BETTER ranger.
(OTOH, my 2nd character is a druid, (she's *Jennaii*, level 45, twinked from my
ranger's old castoff gear mainly.  She's not really important, she's just a
*worker bee*).  I've become quite accustomed to Druid Bashing from this
newsgroup.  It doesn't bother me at all.  I guess it's because my Druid was
really created to port my friends around, not as a real *player*.  
Sarcasm on:
And she's a *good druid*, not one of those selfish camp stealing mob taking
druids that we *all* just learn to hate.  (Trust me, if you are around *them*
enough, you'll learn to hate *them* too))
