How did you get that he implied the "revamp" was a "nerf"?  Try a bit of
reading comprehension.  He may absolutely adore the idea of a revamped zone,
but realize that with the lack of forethought and oftentimes sheer idiocy of
the Sony programmers, some quests from there are very likely to be nerfed.

I know when I heard about the revamp I started thinking that I should go get
my resist flowers that I've been meaning to do for a while now, cause they
will probably get "nerfed" out of existence.  :P
