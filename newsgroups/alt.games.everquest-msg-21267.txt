You know, I was about to mention the same thing.  No, I don't have a BEGGING
hotkey, and I wouldn't even if you were allowed to have a 3 or four line saying
in it.     I am however an extremely fast and accurate typist.  This is
probably from years of MUDing back in the day.  If anyone doens't know, Mud's
were COMPLETELY text based so not only do I type fast, I read perty gud too.
LOL

    You have become better at Typing (255)
