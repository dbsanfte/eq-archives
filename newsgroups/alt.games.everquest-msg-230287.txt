Well, my Pally went there at 27 to goof off one evening and went
29...definately not a tick.  He was soloing DB to Yellow, and only killed
two, maybe three MObs after dinging 30, and he's 2 blue in.  This was about
two months or so ago, but I'll try to log him in tonight and check.  I wanna
level him up a bit and go to DL.  I hated LOIO from spending so much time
there when leveling my main through those levels, so I avoided it like the
plague.  Only reason I went back was to try and group to get a prod for the
HS key...was getting getting good xp with alt soloing, so stayed.
