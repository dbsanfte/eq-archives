Bah! Wussies. I make that run alone regularly with nothing but j-boots
and no spells. Yeah, ya take a few points of damage falling off the
cliffs and such, but if you stay dead west out of the tunnel, you come
right up on it. And much like the spiders in the conversation that
started this thread, I rarely get aggro'd by anything on the way. The
mobs in DL are pretty damn big, and you can see them from a long ways
off. First thing I'll normally get aggro from is the Ragers outside of
KC, but then I just zone in anyway.
