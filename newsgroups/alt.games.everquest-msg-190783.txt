If this was the case, the tank's group would always get the XP (if the 
tank manages to do their job and keep aggro).  Anybody who's been on a 
raid that didn't use the PoP raid system can tell you that a group full 
of wizards and rogues can "KS" the raid XP-wise every time without 
pulling aggro off the tank once.

Similarly, a druid that's spamming heals on the tank and pulling aggro 
that way isn't going to KS the group killing a mob.
