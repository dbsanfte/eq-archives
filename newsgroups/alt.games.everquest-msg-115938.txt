It comes from some of us oldtimers. 
In the old text MUDs and BBS door games, they were called Mobile
Objects in the code. When you customized the MUD, you picked up the
terms, adding MOBs, rooms, etc.
 From there, as we evolved in to newer games, graphics, then MMORPG
the name still stuck. And we force it on you young whippersnappers
cause we are too old and set in our ways to change now ;-)
