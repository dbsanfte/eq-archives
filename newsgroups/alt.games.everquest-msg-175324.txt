I've had not so good PoP PU group experiences (having a group that
does nothing because someone is always leaving).  I've also put together
PoP groups that ran like a machine for hours on end.  Unfortunately
my choices to XP narrowed a bit at 61 (and Ward of Xegony is such a
MASSIVE upgrade to a non-epic'd mage that 61 was a requirement).  Add
to that the fact that there are many *very* useful 61 spells I don't
have (Flameshield of Ro - 45pt DS, Sword of Walnan - Proccing Swords
for my pet just to name 2) that I have to spend time where I have a 
shot at parchments.
