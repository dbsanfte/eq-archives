Are we all over-reactive?  You bet we are :)  For what it's worth, you are
not being specially targeted or anything.  It is just that the
question/statement/sentence fragment  (whatever) I'm sure seemed *very*
humorous to several of the people; myself included.

To me I viewed it almost as something that was being implied by you.  In
turn I had to laugh.  If I had thought eq had been hacked everytime that I
could not connect.... well, suffice to say, it would have to be the most
popular target for hackers/dos attacks etc on the net! <g>

Yes a lot of comments and remarks are being crammed down your throat, but
fear not for in a few days someone else (quite possibly me) will make
another remark which suddenly calls down the wrath of all the ng/eq junkies.
Consider this your 15 minutes of fame on the eq newsgroup and laugh about
it, nothing more.

Cheers!
