OK, lay of the methanol, but ethanol makes perfectly good lab punch. You 
just have to make sure you  use the right stuff. Demijohns of 95% pure 
ethanol are ok, the other 5% is just water, but you can get this extra 
purified stuff, 99% pure ethanol or something. What it doesn't tell you on 
the label is that the extra water has been removed by benzene extraction, 
so the 1% of impurities is usually neat carcinogens.

Ethanol and orange juice anyone? For added authenticity, serve in a conical 
flask, maybe add a pellet or two of dry ice...
