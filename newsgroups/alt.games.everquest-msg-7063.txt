Hail All:

I was just recently bestowed the honor of wearing an Ikky BP that belongs to
my guild (the previous wearer got a better BP and passed it on to me).  I
have a question about how the regen effect works:

I was under the impression that the bp just silently 'did its thing' by
increasing the regen rate at all times.  However, yesterday, for the first
time (I've only had the bp for 3 days), after taking some dmg while falling,
I noticed a message - 'your hitpoints regenerate' (or something to that
effect).  I didnt notice any buffs on me (although I had heroic bond on at
the time) to attribute this to.

My concern is that my DEX is too low (72) to get this thing to 'proc' often,
if that is what it does.

If anyone could pass on any wisdom about this...I would greatly appreciate
it.
