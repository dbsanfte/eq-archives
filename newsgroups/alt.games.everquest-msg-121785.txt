I'm not going to offer to buy this from you because a) I've no doubt we're
on different servers and b) I probably couldn't afford your asking price.
But I wouldn't mind knowing where you came across this and what its stats
are as I'm looking for a good piercing weapon to replace a bog-standard Fine
Steel Rapier.

I've seen 1HS weapons with damage stats of 12 and 13 - why can I only find
piercing weapons with a maximum of 4?
