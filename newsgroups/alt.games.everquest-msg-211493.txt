I think it's level 46+ for PoJ, PoN, PoI, PoD.  Level 55+ (is it 56+) for 
PoV, PoS, CoD.  Level 62+ for HoH and BoT.  All other zones require a flag.

As a 55 druid I would highly recommend PoN for soloing.  If you can get the 
stalkers camp, that is an excelent spot.  Not sure what level mobs you can 
charm at your level, but, if you can, there are several animals available, 
young bats, bloodravens, and nightstalkers.
