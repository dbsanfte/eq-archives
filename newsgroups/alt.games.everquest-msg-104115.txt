I saw that.  "Rock and roll" was the tune.  It's odd that presigious
Cadillac would use a rock and roll song at all to push their product, let
alone use Zeppelin.
To think that this ugly trend started when Sun Country wine coolers used
"Walk this way" in their ads back in the '80s.  I believe they were the
first to use a pop song without at least changing the words like they USED
to do once upon a time.  Now they are too lazy to even go that distance
anymore.
Then came the use of "Revolution" for Nike's if I recall correctly (thank
you Micheal Jackson for buying the rights to all Beatles songs, perverting
them for posterity).
Next we'll see Viagra using "Do ya think I'm sexy" or possibly "I touch
myself".

I most certainly hope not.

Sean...
