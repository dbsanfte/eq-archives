If you're gonna leave EQ for either AO or DaoC, I say pick DAoC.  Played
DAoC since beta 2 and loved it since, AO I beta tested and it sucked, heard
it got lots better so went out and bought it (was only $20).  Yes AO is a
hell of a lot better then it was at the end of beta and after it was first
releases, but I couldn't get into it.  I found AO kinda boring.
