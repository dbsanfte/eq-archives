Some advice from someone who tried:
Level up a couple of times in EASY running distance of a guard. They
will kill steal you a bit, but it helps keep the PK'ers away. Once you
have a level or two, find an area that is out of the way but has some
newbie critters to hunt. Start levelling there. I wandered my poor
Halfling cleric over to Tox, nary a soul in sight for 3 levels. Pretty
hard to get there, and I don't know if the erudites would have KOS,
some freindly druid camo'd me through Erudite and bound me just inside
the paineel zone so I could hang around a bit. Those skellies right at
the tox zone were a pain when I died, but you do what ya gotta do. I
was even able to trade with the merchants in tox, but I didn't try
until I had killed a lot of faction creatures.
