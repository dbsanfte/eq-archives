First off, get your int OR wis as high as possible. Buy a C3/4/5 to max it
out.
Second off, get a gnomish device that gives +5% in the skill you wish to
upgrade and wield it when making combines.

Tailoring is based mostly on non-vendor stuff. If you can farm greenies well
the easiest way is:
silk swatches
silk armor (lowest trivial first)
cured silk armor
Crystalline silk armor OR the quivers (if you can farm cats faster then crys
silks)
Wu's armor

This will take you up to 158 skill, which is what my skill was when I
completed the 8th shawl. Anything over 158 is very expensive and the
ingredients are hard to farm (Black Panterskin and Solstice Robe come to
mind)

Smithing is harder. You can get up to 115 in no time flat with almost no
cash, but after that it gets more tedious. Ornate chain (check eqtraders
which are the cheapest but still skillupgrades and switch to the next
trivial when you reached one) then there is an inbetween step which I
skipped and then there is Fine Plate. Which IMO is a pain to make because
you need HQ ore and that's "sold out" at times.
Never went beyond Fine Plate so don't know how hard that is.

For the throwing knifes: You have trained the skill at least once, and you
are throwing at exp-giving mobs I hope?
If not, do so. If you already do both.. well the ran-engine of EQ is rather
fubar. You can get 10 skillups in 1 minute or go days without any.
For instance, my swimming skill was stuck at 196 for ages. I even swam for 8
hours in Shadowhaven to try to increase it (eb item on, aim at a corner, hit
auto-run and go afk), but no go.
A month ago I passed through Siren's Grotto and got 2 swimming skillups
while I swam maybe 20 seconds.
