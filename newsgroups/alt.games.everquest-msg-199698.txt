Ok I should have been more specific.

To be fair, my shaman can tank mobs in PoI/PoV if he has to, and sure he
will live through the fight while the cleric heals him.

The mana consumed on the clerics part though is just insane in comparison.
If each pull and kill consumed that much mana every kill, I just wouldn't
bother.   Its the same for me when my rogues had to camp.  Sure he will live
through the fight, sure he could probably go again, but down and down the
mana bar plummets.

In PoE (elementals) with my monk tanking, and running the cleric (well the
whole group), the cleric casts MoR, Hammer pet (right click on pants), and
multiple cheals every fight.

By the end of the fight/come next pull she is always at 95mana+
5 hours later, she will still be 95+ mana.  (Exception of course at buff
time)

If after each fight she was down by 20% mana, and med breaks were required
every 5 fights, to me that wouldn't be acceptable.  Thats what happens when
my rogue "tanks.

Yes chaotic.

If anything, his shaman should tank.  Use slow, root and dots to hold agro,
whilst his rogue backstabs.  That would improve the kill rate (and exp) by
probably 40%.  And I bet cleric healing wouldn't be much different.

Gotta dash, home time!
