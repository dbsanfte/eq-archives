A lvl 35 necro should be able to do it easily. The runner is relavely
wimpy compared to the other mobs in the zone, and since he paths right
past the grimling zone tunnel, you could just wait there and not pull
any other mobs while you wait for him to run past. Respawn time on his
is around 80 minutes. 

You'll be KOS in Katta though, it's easiest to bring a friend and plan
on getting two. After the first pouch, have your friend run to Katta
and do the turnin for the pattern so he can loot a 2nd one (since both
of those items are lore). Alternately, camp an alt in the tunnel for
looting and hope nobody else passes through while you switch toons.
