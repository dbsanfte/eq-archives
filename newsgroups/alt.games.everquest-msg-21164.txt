I fail to see why I shouldn't be reading this post.  Obviously I don't know
if it's a smartass response or something not stupid until I read it.  Of
course, it's likely to be a smartass response (like it was), but by some act
of God it might not have been.  I also fail to see why I shouldn't respond,
just because I don't care doesn't mean I'm not allowed to respond.  What
makes me 'cutely stupid'?  The methods I offered could easily work, similar
to how it's technically possible to flee from the cops when they're chasing
you.  It's not a good idea, and law abiding citizens won't like you for it,
but it IS possible to get away, just as it is possible to get a CD key
without getting in trouble using one of my methods.  There are thousands of
unsolved murders; approximately 30-40% of people who rob convienience stores
get away with it, I bet the odds would be much higher for this.
