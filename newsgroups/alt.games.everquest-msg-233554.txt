Here's how to judge a good heal:

Any heal that brought your target up to 100% is less preferable than one 
that brings them to 99%. I don't bother topping people up unless they are 
under 95%, and for melees I usually make that 90%. 

Any CHeal is preferable when you A) have time for it and B) Cannot heal the 
target to full with regular spells for less than 400 mana.

Celestial healings can save you in a shitstorm. If multiple mobs are coming 
in, try dropping one on the MT. This delays the time when you have to 
CHeal, and buys your tank time to get aggro back. Additionally, Cele's tend 
to be pretty mana-efficient (the first one, IIRC, is sucky, but they get 
*much* better.)

Your two lines of DD heals are the *worst* spells you can cast, in most 
situations. I use Remedy to top up casters. The thing that line has going 
for it is range and speed. Other "instant" heals are great for the times 
when you realize CHeal won't hit- interrupt the spell and cast the instant 
heal.

The MA is your first concern, followed by yourself, followed by the 
chanter/shaman. Remember to weigh this with the threat for that given 
character- an add on the tank is nowhere near as bad as an add on the 
chanter.

HTH!
