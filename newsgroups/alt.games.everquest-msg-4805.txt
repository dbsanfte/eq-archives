Posting (falsely) about people being gay is not a relevant issue.

Posting how cool you think you are is not a relevant issue.

Please quote ONE thread which you originated, which is directly related to
everquest. You won't. You can't. You are an imbecile.

Find a nice web board where people like yourselves are actually
welcome....actually, what you say makes quite a bit of sense. You seem

You are also EXACTLY the kind of person who got whineplay shut down.

What an honor.
