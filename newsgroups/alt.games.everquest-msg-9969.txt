Not illegal, not paying would be illegal...  No different than offering

they are still entitled to the reward.  They may recieve jail time, but
the reward still stands.

learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
