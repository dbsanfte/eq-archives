Last I read at EQTraders, there was still a lot of debate as to whether 
success/failure does affect skillup rate.  There is some data to support 
that it does, but, not enough data to be convincing, given the nature of 
the PRNG used by EQ.  There is definitely no consensus on whether 
something far above your skill, or near your skill will cause more 
skillups.  In fact, the lastest I recall reading at eqtraders indicated 
that you are best skilling up on things that are close, but not too close 
to your current skill level.
