You know...  It is funny when someone like you goes off about something,
then someone comes along... Reads what you posted and has to give you a
small dose of reality.

Reality - Verant does not acknowledge camps.  If said guide acknowledged
the camp, whiner would have gotten the camp without rolling for it,
assuming whiner actually had the camp before all of you.

The rule book in which the guide quoted from, is their Policies and
Procedures...  You know, the little bible they need to quote from on how
things are handled.  What she quoted to you guys was called a 'Contested
Spawn'.  You know...  Ragefire is a spawn that two or more parites claim
the right to a particular spawn, usually a spawn that is rare or hard to
get.  In this case, your group, another group and his group are contesting
over Ragefire as to who gets rights to him.

Since neither groups were willing to work out a deal...  The guide, when
called in, will arbitrate so as to at least enforce some sense of fairness
for the people involved, which means random chance.  If the winning group
FAILS to accomplish their goal, the mob is then free for the next group who
gets the agro.

This is not saying Verant acknowledges camping...  It is saying, "In order
to prevent Kill Stealing, these are your options."  Since neither side
wanted to work it out...  Your group was not willing to let other group try
and fail, and take it from there, you come here, whining and bemoaning how
you got shafted by a guide who was doing the thing guides do, referee
people who act like immature, selfish children.

Now mind you, there are things I don't like about guides...  But I don't
like people who rant cluelessly like this.  Whiner boy also has no concept
of what Kill Stealing is, which is if the mob is agroed on a group, and
another group kills the mob, getting the XP and benes of it...  That's Kill
Stealing.  The whiner should know better, just as you, that Camping is
purely a player thing.  All mobs are a First Agro, group gets it, thing.
No one has 'imminent domain' of any mob or area, but players respect a camp
because a player or group of players are working an area.

A rare spawn area is hardly campable, because it is just that, a rare
spawn.  Areas like Splitpaw and such are campable in terms of players,
because the next spawn will come up within a matter of minutes.
