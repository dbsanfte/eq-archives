While I'd have to say that at most times the article was objective, as it
should be, at some points it did seem to disfavor the gamers who joined in a
vigil online. For some of us, that was the best we could do.
I cannot donate blood because I've been pierced/tattooed within the last six
months. While I could have volunteered for one, it was 10 miles from my house
and I had no car. The ingame vigil was a touching response from online gamers,
in my opinion.
Also, the ad for a life insurance company on an article concerning the WTC
seems to be in bad form.

Like the ambulance chasers of the Life Insurance trade.
