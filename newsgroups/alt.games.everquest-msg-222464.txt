I group regularly with a stunning Necro.  In your average XP or LDON group,
we can count on him to:

Do DPS with spells and pet (Mage level DPS or better)
Lifetap/Feed HP to group
Manatap/Feed Mana to group (Theft of Vitae?)
Mezz if mobs are undead
Pull
Rootpark
Interrupt casters
Ress if the cleric and paladin both go down

Oh, and if he's bored or if the cleric or enchanter are OOM, he'll twitch.
I almost NEVER ask him to twitch; his mana is more valuable than mine!
