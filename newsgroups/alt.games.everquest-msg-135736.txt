tongue in cheek? lol its obvious verant are bribing people into getting SOL.
POP will ocme with more bribes, as did Kunark.
As for improving the bazaar, theres no real reason why someone shouldnt be
able to set themselves up as a trader in EC and the trader list just
displays the zone. If you're worried about the track feature being abused,
then maybe just have that available in city zones or the bazaar. I wouldnt
be surprised if bazaar in any zone will be done, once they figure they have
sold as many as they are going to.

Improving the bazaar to handle what it currently does firstly by removing
the barrels and eye candy. Im not sure about the rendering on the 3d engine,
but perhaps putting up more walls to hide more players might improve things.
They could even switch you to a very simple generic trader model when you're
trading. The banks should be spread out more. I have the most trouble around
the banks.

I would feel a little bit annoyed if I was one of the poor people who could
only use the computer/network for a few hours each day. As it is, I have
cable and can stay logged in 24/7, and this really gives me an unfair
advantage.
