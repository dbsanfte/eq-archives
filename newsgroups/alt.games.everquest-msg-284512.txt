It is too far away.  As far as I know, pet agro works the same as any
mob agro.  If you tell them to attack, they are agroed, but will only
chase up to a certain distance.  In other words, you have to run down
to the nobles, target your pull, park the pet there, and run back to
the entrance.  Now send pet, tell him to back off as soon as he agros,
and hit follow me (otherwise he goes back to guarding and gets
squished).  Without a monk feigned in the room on a dual box or
something though, I don't see how this would be possible for an SK.
Unless you found some clicky bind sight item or something...

Being non-KOS to Chardok, at least on Combine, is probably critical.

I have made a few myself and used them a lot in my late 50s and early
60s for lifetapping.  This should work for shorter distances, just not
if you want to single a mob from one end of a dungeon to another.
