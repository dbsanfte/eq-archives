At the moment I'm playing on an XP 1800+ with 512 of ram and a Radeon 9000.
It's crawling (on lowest graphic settings, when the americans get on it's
really laggy) and zoning takes about 5 minuites (last night I spent 45 mins
trying to zone into willow wood, it kept on chucking me back to character
select) but we put in another 512 (from my partners machine) and it worked
much better, sure the graphics are still bad but zoning only takes a few
seconds with 1 gig of RAM. I can live with the bad graphics until after xmas
as I'm crafting mainly, but after that I will have to get a new Graphics
Card.
This was just meant to show that a crappy machine can still play it, the
graphics will be bad and unless you have 1 gig of ram it will crawl, but you
can play it, and the gameplay isn't really reduced by playing it with low
graphics.
HTH people who want to know about low spec machines
Ceri :o)
