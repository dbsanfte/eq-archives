"consider",  by default bound to the "c" key. It's the same one that 
tells you roughly the level of the creature you are targetting. The 
messages go from "scowls at you, ready to attack" (very bad faction 
indeed), to "regards you as an ally" (they want you to marry their 
daughters). Normally, most monsters are either indifferent or KOS (Kill 
On Sight), but other creatures and NPCs have faction standings that can 
be influenced by your actions.
