If you read the origanl message all the wizard said was he had been there
for 4 hours and he didn't care who hits him first 1 nuke will take him down.
Here is the extrack
"I was camping Hadden in preparation for a Kedge Keep
raid next week.  I'd killed him 3 times and had his
spawn time pretty well down.  As a melee character, I
don't have the "bind here, play somewhere else" option.
I log off and play an alt, work at home, other things.

I log back on 10 minutes before he pops.  There is a level 58
wizard there.  He tells me that he's been waiting on Hadden
for 4 hours, and I have to go away.

I tell him that not only is Hadden popping in about 10-15 minutes,
and that his 4 hours was wasted, but that the first person to
touch him has the right to kill him, whether by him aggro'ing
you or you smacking/casting on him.

He said "I don't care who touches him first, one nuke will
take him down.""

Later he tries to justify himself by saying he has hadden 3/4 dead before
the wizard even begins to cast. How can you KS when the player does the most
damage gets the kill?
