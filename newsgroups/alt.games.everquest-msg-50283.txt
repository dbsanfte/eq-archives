I am an enchanter I still have no problem with 8 I dont have Buffs memed
when I am fighting I know how long the buffs last and bring them up when
needed but then I also bought a timer to keep track of stuff like that. Why
have spells memed if your not going to use them. You just have to learn to
buff players during downtime.
