I'd think that from a profit standpoint they would have been better
off to do it the other way around. Offer the expensive transfers first
and a year later offer a cheaper transfer w/o gear for those who
weren't willing to pay the initial price. Sounds to me like this one
comes under the category of 'how can we milk our cash cow a bit more
w/o pissing off too many of our players'.
