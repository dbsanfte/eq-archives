I don't know if your real question got answered or not, and I was wondering
too.

If I sell back the unwanted loot I bought trying to open up a slot, will
that stuff then show up BEFORE the stuff that I want, or does it go to the
end of the line.  For example in the following list.

Cracked Staff-shows up in window
Rusty Mace
Pixie Dust
Bone Shards
Spider Silk

I buy the cracked staff and it opens a window.  Then I sell a spider silk
that doesn't show up (meaning the vendor has more) I don't want the cracked
staff, so I sell it back.  Does it go back to the top of the list?  Or does
it go to the bottom, pushing the spider silks up one level???  This would
make a difference on when to sell back the unwanted stuff.

Thanks
