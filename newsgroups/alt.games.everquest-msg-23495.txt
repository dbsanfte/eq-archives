The other thing about LOiO (and Kunark in general) is that several no-drop
Iksar-only quest items can be found there. My Iksar gets very annoyed when
grouping with folks who are in the habit of looting all those Tattooed
Sarnak Heads, Recruitment Letters, Skeleton Fists etc and destroying them.

While trying to get Zorash to pop in OT I killed lots of Saenaks and one
dropped the Earring. I had no idea it was sought after or rare, I just
thought - (sigh) another item Druids can't use and logged on my Iksar SK to
loot it.

It could be that the looter didn't know what he was looting.
