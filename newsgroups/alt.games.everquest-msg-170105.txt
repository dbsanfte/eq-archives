Prior to POP?  75% of the time easily, because noone can cast it indoors... so
unless you are willing to run outside, get SOW, and run back in, then you have
what 20 minute or so before its gone.

So far every POP plane I've been to has been outdoors, to I'd say closer to 25%
of the time, 20% if you include 49+ bard selo (which he can slap on you before
every pull, so more than adequate for that purpose)

As my characters are a cleric, a bard, and a druid, I find regen an utter joke.
I'll try to imagine what it would be like to have to wait half an hour to go
from 50% health to full health, and what a boon it would be to cut that to 20
minutes.

One.  Two.  Three (crunch.... eating totsie pop and casting Cheal) Thirteen
seconds.  Time saved with regen... 6 nanoseconds

One.  Two.  Three (crunch) Gheal Gheal Gheal Gheal Gheal Gheal.  Twenty
seconds.  Time saved with regen.... 0.1 second

One.  Two.  Three (crunch) Playing HP song, going to go get a soda.  Three
minutes.  Time saved with regen... 20 seconds
