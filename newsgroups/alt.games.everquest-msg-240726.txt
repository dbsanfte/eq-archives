Days, actually.  Almost a month at each end.  Europe goes to savings time
well ahead of the Nort Americanos.  Let's face it.  We're slow (I can prove
it.   We elected another Bush.  We just will not learn.  And, we can't get
the hang of the metric system, either.).  Oh, and they change back before us
also.

: and for a number of hours you'll go to
: GMT+1 while SOE is still on PDT... or you'll go to GMT+2 while SOE is
: still in PST....and in both cases for a few hours you won't be 9 hours
: apart... but that's nitpicking ;)
