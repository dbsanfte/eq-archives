I honestly believe that most healers will adapt.  The range of abilities
we have in the UI community in WoW to help with information overload
staggers the imagination.  I think the only reason healers have been asked
to watch 40 people up until now is because mods made it possible to do
it that way.

When you say divide the task you get reminded that other healers die - 
that's not a problem.  A new addon designed for 2.0 allows you to specify
what people a healer should watch (the others gray out so as not to be
distracting) and specifies backup healers - so when a primary healer for
a group dies, those people light up on their backup healer's display so
they know to keep an eye on them.

When you also remember that raid sizes are dropping in TBC to 25 people, 
that the devs have flat out stated that they made these changes so they
won't have to design encounters around super fast, super-accurate
decursing and the fact that they have made HP climb faster than DPS in
the expansion (they cut the price of +sta in the item budget in half)
in order to slow down combat --  All of these things mitigate the
potential downside of losing current automation abilities.
