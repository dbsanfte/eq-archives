Yeah, kinda neat.  There's a copy of the article text in the story at
slashdot.org if you don't feel like subscribing.

I've read Richard Bartle's "Designing Virtual Worlds", where he hashes
over some of the same things in his column.  He makes some interesting
points, but I get this grognard/guru vibe from him sometimes which
works against the points he's trying to make.  Basically his "I was
here first so I know best " attitude seeps out regularly, and his
fixation on Perma-death turns me off.

I'm not sure if PD would be the solution, but it might make things
interesting.  I didn't get a chance to try the Hardcore server in EQ
last year.  Lance? or anyone else who gave it a go, how did it work
out compared to the regular game?  I guess a game would have to be
explicitly designed for it from the get-go to really make it work.

Anyhoo, neat reading for sure.
