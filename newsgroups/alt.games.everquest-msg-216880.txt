I don't *have* a rough target.  I'm *always* aware of about how much mana
the healers (and everybody else) has.  If it's enough ("enough" varies
constantly) then I pull.  I don't constrain myself to arbitrary "must be at
80% to pull" limits when they aren't necessary.

Or, humor me, I recognize when "its not going to be enough" and play
accordingly.  Now, humor me, you might find it useful to check out the other
side of that coin and play accordingly when "its going to be enough".  :P

Try not to fatalistically resign yourself to losing.  Seriously, all these
people arguing about how easy it is to wipe in an LDoN dungeon make me
question how you ever managed to play in a harder area (of which there
are plenty).

Now they're pulling at 70 mana?  At 60 mana?  You're right, I don't have any
argument at all once they start playing like me.  :P

Hell, not when you decide they get to play like me to try and prove me wrong
(and how can you miss the irony of that?).

I admit defeat.  Yes, when you say that you wait for 80% mana between pulls,
but actually don't mind pulling at 70, 60, 50...  yes, I've lost this
argument.  You are entirely right.  It *is* better to go ahead and pull
rather than waiting for 80% mana.  How could I have been so wrong?  :P

I am shaking your hand.  You win.  It is much better to pull at 70, 60, 50,
etc., rather than waiting for 80% between pulls.  How could I have been so
stupid?

You are so right.  I was so blind to say that that group should be waiting
for 80% mana.  I concede defeat.  Going ahead and pulling at 70, 60, 50... 
*much* better.  I was a fool.  :P

Take any of the "duos" that post here, drop them into the level-appropriate
LDoN dungeon, and they could duo it.  It wasn't much of a brag.  :)

But your group is adjusting to match my pull rate instead of doing like they
were "supposed" to do and waiting for 80% mana.  Once you play like me, why
do you think I'm going to argue with you anymore?  I'll just concede defeat
and agree with you that I was right.

I'm going to stop arguing with you now.  Or rather, it appears you stopped
arguing with me so I'll leave you to pull at 80, then 70, then 60, then 50
and argue with the next guy that says he won't wait for 80%.  :P
