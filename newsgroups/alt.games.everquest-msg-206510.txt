Im a 55 cleric and have been working off and on on me epic since 50

There is really 7 steps
begurgle
Gimblox
Plasmatic priest
Ixiblat fer
Overking
Shards
Ragefire

You need a bunch of buddies  (2+ groups)  for Ixy, the overking and ragefire
I did begurgle with a druid buddy, and Gimblox and shards solo.  Well
working on the shards now.  Its a big pain.  Id head over to skyfire and
spend the next couple of levels huntin there to get them.  The priest i had
9 people show up  when i asked in guild chat,  overkill.  really only needed
3 people.
