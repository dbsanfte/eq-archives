Cool! Nope, just 2 speakers. Was thinking of getting a sub-woofer today so 
maybe I'll get 2 more speakers as well. Now.. just have to figure out how I 
can put the speakers "behind me."

I'm using some Bose RoomMate speakers right now. They are probably 15+ years 
old, but still sound pretty good (to my ears anyhow). Am I better off just 
getting a "set" of 4 speakers + subwoofer?  Or can I add 2 more without a 
problem?

Thanks!!
Anita
