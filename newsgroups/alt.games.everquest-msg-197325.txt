I'm going to take a bit of issue with calling your group of 62s well
balanced (for trials anyway).  First off, you had NO melee dps classes
along for the ride....SK/War are both wonderful damage sponges, but
just don't get it done in the dps department.  Druid, in an xp group,
is ok spell dps, but again, in the exe trial wizards and mages are
better.  The second group you mentioned is actually MORE well
balanced.  Tank, healer, melee dps x2, and room for two support
classes..whether that be a mezzer, extra healer, spell dps,
slows/hastes, whatever.  It seems your first group was healer, tank,
tank, support class x3.  Just my thoughts, feel free to flame, argue,
debate, or call me elitist =P.
