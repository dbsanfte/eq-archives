No, I'm not.  You're talking about something else entirely.

Can't follow a thread?  Here, I'll make it easy:

So, you're missing the point.  A GM *can* ban you for bitching
about the product.  They're not likely to do so unless it gets
way out of hand, but they *can.*   And the idea of a consumer
protection authority stepping in is inane.

Any argument about whether their customer service would
rescind a ban is totally irrelevant.  A GM *can* ban you.  Period.
And if you really think some consumer agency is going to get
involved in someone's EQ account because they bitched in
game enough to draw not only GM attention but a ban as well,
you really need to get out more.
