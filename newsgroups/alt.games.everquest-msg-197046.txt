Also the weird thing is this is only one CD but but my original EQ New Dawn
was three disks - the lable on the front of the new one says - 'Features
Everquest New Dawn + The Planes of Power Add-On' the label on my original
(EQ New Dawn) says 'Features Everquest + Runis of Kunark + Scard of Velious
+ Shadows of Luclin Add-Ons'. How the heck did they manage to include New
Dawn + PoP on 1 CD then (it's definately CD and not DVD).

Quick response please, I need to get playing I am begining to get the
shakes.
