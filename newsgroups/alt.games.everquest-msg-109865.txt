My biggest problem is all the time invested in EQ1 will go out the door if I
go to EQ2.  I don't mind upgrading my computer.  I don't mind buying the
latest expansion.  I do mind having to start over again.  I barely have the
time to play one MMORPG, let alone 2 (I quit UO because of this).  I always
thought that EQ1 would be continually changing and upgraded to match the
graphics of the time.  Now they are going to be drawing some old players
from EQ1 and any new players will start with EQ2 (why play EQ1 if there is a
better version out there).  I'm sure they will continue to upgrade EQ1.  But
if EQ2 becomes popular enough, there will be less and less done on EQ1 until
they finally retire it (and I can join the Win95 players in angst against
Sony / Verant for letting us down again).  When that happens, I will be
completely disgusted with them for all my lost playing time.  Maybe, when
the end comes for EQ1, they will be offering to transfer any existing
characters to EQ2 for free so as not to upset any people.  This is the only
"acceptable" result that I can forsee.

As for me, I will continue to play EQ1 and hope for the best.
