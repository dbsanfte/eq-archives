Believe it or not, there are folk who rarely have the opportunity
to group with Bards.  That lack of experience does not equate to
idiocy.  It's a simple matter to politely educate the uninformed,
thereby convincing them that you are a GoodGuy(tm) rather than an
ArrogantAss(tm).  The same approach allows for an extremely rapid
identification of the actual idiots, who will typically respond
with something profoundly stupid.
