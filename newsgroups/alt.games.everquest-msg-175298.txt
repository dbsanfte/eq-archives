It's not an issue of "several times in three years" that the OP was
complaining about, but rather several times in a couple hours.  A
lot of the time I've spent solo has been simply because I knew that
I would likely have to AFK to deal with the rugrats on a semi-regular
basis, and it's just not fair to ask a group to put up with that.
The same is true when you're gonna be called away from the game soon.
When you have the sort of turnover the OP reported it's pretty damned
likely that all (or perhaps all but one) of the sudden departures was
easily predictable by the player who left.  There's one helluva
difference between telling your group "I gotta go in 15" after an
hour and a half of playing together, and telling your group "I gotta
go now" after 15 minutes of playing together.
