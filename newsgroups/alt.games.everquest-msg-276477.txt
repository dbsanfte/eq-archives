Actually, unless they change the level caps on stuns, or add new
spells for Paladins to hold aggro with, this would severely cripple
Paladin tanking post-55.  Level limits on spells like stuns and lulls
are entirely different from immune flags on mobs.  As an example,
Kaev at level 63 has 8 or 9 stuns in his spell book, with exactly one
of them that is not level capped at 61 or lower.  (Come to think of
it, that's pretty pathetic even without the proposed nerf.  Stuns are
an EQ Paladins most defining spell-casting ability, and at 63 there
are blue-con mobs that I have only one stun to use on, one stun with
a 12-second recast delay will NOT stop a gater).

At the high end it is even worse, a level 70 Paladin would have no
aggro spells other than Flash of Light to use on a L71+ mob, if they
implement this as described so far.

Fortunately, not only have many Paladins on the SOE boards pointed
out this problem, they have done so with a minimum of the usual
foaming at the mouth crap I associate with those boards, and SOE
reps have posted stating specificly that they are not intending to
cripple those who rely on level-immune spells to generate aggro
(some still worry that they'll push the changes live and not fix
the problems until some time later).
