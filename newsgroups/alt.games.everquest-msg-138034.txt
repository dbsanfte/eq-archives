 It's not a major task but for me it definitely falls under the
'annoying' category. Fight him and get back to me.

 Yes. Priest someone or other drops a key. Or is that for Sevitor?
Actually I don't really remember now. I hate the zone myself.

 Sevitor takes about 3 groups. Maybe 2 but it might take awhile. That's
the only other named I know in there except Grieg. Well there's that
Mayral guy who procs DA all over the place.

 As for duoing in there. You may want to bring a few extra along. Some
of those blue mobs have a lot of HP. Probalby not as many as those
rubble rousers in Akheva, but you'll definitely be beating on them
awhile. I went in there with a cleric (not 60 though) and another monk
and ended up having the cleric gate while we feigned. One group should
be enough. If you get lucky you might get a bandage summoning item.

 I'm the reverse. I'd rather not fight Greig ever again. But he drops a
few nice items so I know we'll be back there.
