I sympathize with that. I cleared easily 20 pieces of misc junk out of
my bank account this past week.

>Tergon's Spellbook

Allakhazam doesn't seem to have this in the quest by item list. Odd.
Anyhow, here is the actual quest:

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=16

"Tergon Brenclog, located in the library, wants his spellbook back.
[...] Returning the spellbook gives the following faction adjustments:
+Eldritch Collective, - Dark Reflection, - The Dead, + Gem Choppers, +
King AkAnon. You also get experience and an item, usually a scroll."

In other words, junk.

>Drop of Grease

I seem to dimly recall this is related to the Gnome pirates in
Velious.
