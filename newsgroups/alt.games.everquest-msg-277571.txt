There are a few required quests, but not many.  EQ2 does handhold you for 
the quests as well, although I have heard not quite as well as WoW does.  
In EQ2, you have a quest journal, that updates automatically as you 
complete parts of a quest.  There is a spot on the screen to display a 
synopsis of the current quest you are interested in (you can change which 
one at any time), and there is the full quest journal which provides more 
detailed information regarding the quests.
