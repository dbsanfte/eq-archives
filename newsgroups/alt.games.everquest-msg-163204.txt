Smithing is not likely to be profitable for you until your skill is right
around 200, and even then your sales will be relatively few and far between
(the prices on Acrylia chain/plate can make it profitable, but you only have
just so many people that can afford to buy it and want that specific armor).
Believe me when I and other posters tell you that smithing is VERY expensive
to learn. It is a HUGE time and money hole.

Smithing can eventually (above 200 a bit) become reasonably profitable on a
sale by sale basis, but you'll find that supplies are difficult to come by
unless you are high enough to farm them yourself (think 50+ and more likely
55+ for black acrylia), and even if you are high enough, you're going to
need friends to hunt with you on it.

Have I mentioined yet that it is WILDLY expensive to learn?

Best path these days from 115 is either ornate chain straight up to at least
155, or embroidery needles to 122, and then ornate chain. Be sure, however,
to check your cultural armor, as some races have some fairly decent options
as far as a cheaper and easier route up a bit.

From 155 or so, the question becomes a lot more difficult. If you have more
time then money, then go to FSP. If time is more the issue, then stick with
Platinum ornate chain until 162. You'll find that as long as you don't fail,
the later choice actually doesn't cost much and saves you the hassle of
finding more padding. If, however, you fail, well - did I mention that
smithing is VERY expensive to learn?

FSP is the thing up to 188 I believe it is. From there, it's on to Acrylia
armors (chain and then plate). Failures in this region are going to be
outragious in cost (a fail on a plate combine is going to run you around
350pp or more in materials lost). At some point, you're going to want to
either start farming for Shadowscream armor materials (careful, some of
these are NO RENT) and/or work on Black Acrylia weapons. The former will
cost you time rather than money, the latter can be quite profitable
depending on failure rates and just how much of it the market will bear. As
you approach 250, you can start going for the PoTC sickle, and that you'll
find a good market for - failures are, however, again pricey.

Personally, I would recommend that most folks avoid smithing. I chose it
because I decided I was willing to "take one for the Gipper" for my guild.
We have a ton of people coming up on their PoTC quest age, and finding a
smith for the sickle combines has been both expensive and a problem in terms
of finding people to do it.

My words here is from my experience up through 160 in smithing, and from the
*copious* amount of research I've done on the subject. I deliberately have
not kept track of expenses - I don't want to know - but I can tell you I'm
out in the vicinity of 2-3K so far and figure that I will need to endure
another 3-5K or more in losses before it turns around, and I'm counting
myself as lucky since I can push my STR up to 159 and with buffs my STR is
usually anywhere from 199-233 when I'm working on things.

Sing

PS: If you're going to do it, then by a gearlock right from the beginning -
fewer fails means less losses, and many believe that there is a higher
chance of a skillup on success than on failure (SOE denies this).
