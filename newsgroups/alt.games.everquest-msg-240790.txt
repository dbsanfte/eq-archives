Better by who? By the small group of people who want to be you?... the
rest of us think you ought get a life.  Being in an uberguild is
something of a standing joke to a lot of players... I had a friend in
Afterlife... we spent far most of our time laughing at the pathetic
turn his life took (what with being called away from parties and what
not to go stand in a CH chain with his cleric alt (he wasn't even
allowed to play his main half the time...).

We knew he wasn't a better player than us, and we didn't consider him
one, we did acknowledge he had better gear than us, but honestly, we
wern't going to sacrifice our enjoyment of the game to get it...

It merely says where they are. Not how good they are. And where they
are is largely dependant on their gear, and where they were last
week...

Yes I know, they'd tell you go AA by yourself and come back when your

Top guilds used to accept naked cross server apps... it wasn't *that*

Good example of why such guilds are largely considered a joke.

Not to mention wrapping their heads around the idea that they are
going to spend 60 hours a week bored out their skulls, not getting
paid, so some twit with screwed up priorities can tells them where to
stand. 

All for the priviledge of carrying around a tag over their head that
tells the rest of the world I have better gear than you because I know
how to take it in the ass from my guild. 

If that's what being uber is... keep it.

There was a thread here just recently... "Can my guild skip Luclin &
Velious" and go straight to PoP & GoD... and the answer so far has
been a resounding no... because of gear.

All the strategy and togetherness in the world isn't going to save you
if your raid force fails to resist AEs too often... or can't do enough
dps... both of which are primarily gear concerns.

Ah, but a simple test would flush you out in a heartbeat. If they
suspect mass bots they would simply craft questions that a raid of 50
bots and 2 people would find very difficult. Hi, this is GM
so-an-so... am I standing on your right or left? Link me your sword.
/say crunchy monkey. /tt what did i just say?  I'm swapping
breastplates...(swap swap)  what colour was the one I was just
wearing?

Or /tt target one... what is 6 x 5? wait for 
/tt target two...  and that divided by 10 is?

Your not going to be able to craft reasonably fast responses to those,
and / or you will get tripped up by having too much or too little
information.

And you give way too much credit to software being able to adapt with
contingencies... an unexpected add... an AE that gets through
particularly hard... a lag spike...

Plus if multiple targets need to be simultaneously engaged by multiple
groups even if the command structure is tight one person isn't going
to be able to make and relay all the command decisionsto the right
subgroups in real-time.

That much at least is largely true.
