  I liked hearing about the changes, because I thought I'd like the changes.
However, what I experienced today I can't say I much enjoyed.

  I am fine with smarter casters.  Some casters... like shamans and to an
extent, druids, were too weak in their former NPC form... they spent too
much time casting relatively harmless spells, like roots and slows that
you'd resist 90% of the time.  The only reason I ever feared shaman NPCs is
because of the insane pathing on their stupid pets.  Those NPCs definitely
needed some tweaking.

  However, when I can't pull a light blue conning wurm because it's chain
casting a 900 point nuke, something is wrong.

  I also think that areas like Droga that feature scores of wizards, clerics
and magicians are going to be a tremendously difficult challenge for anybody
who would be fighting there (except maybe level 60 shadow knights killing
goblins for the Khurki quest needed to complete Greenmist, or higher level
people trying to improve their Chardok faction.)  Maybe not, but it seems
like it may be that way.  I bet Sol A and Runnyeye just got a lot tougher
too, though at least those places have some decent loot.  Split Paw is
probably pretty rough and the loot there has always sucked.

  I fought in Kedge Keep tonight, and though it was a bit rough with
mermaids nuking me for 450 with Calefication and chain nuking with less
damaging spells, I'd say the area is managable if you have a tight, strong
group that knows what its doing.  It's not somewhere I would think about
going merely on the basis of loot and exp though... it's only a place I'd
fight if I were in the mood for something different, or for a Phinigel raid
if a guildmate or friend needed him dead for a quest.

  Otherwise I'd say the changes are fine.  They just need to get those wurms
to stop casting those ridiculous nukes and make some adjustments to other
zones (either by boosting the zone exp modifier, or thinning out the number
of casters they have in them, or by toning downg the melee capabilities of
caster NPCs.)
