So, I got a new computer last week. Everything was fine at first, but
problems have cropped up involving several games. In the order of
events, I installed WinXP and updated all my graphics and sound
drivers. Then I installed Diablo 2. It ran fine, I updated it and
everything, played a bit, then logged out because Everquest had
finished patching (Took an hour because I was downloading most of the
expansion files...). Went in there, and was thrilled with how smoothly
everything ran on my new system (Looooong overdue upgrade). Logged out
that night and tried D2 again....and the troubles start. It tried to
run at about 1/3 screen, with a screenshot of EQ filling the rest of
the background (Kinda a SS, I hadn't taken one in game. It was the
last screen image before I logged out...). I rebooted and tried again,
this time it wouldn't run at all. Running its video test told me that
it couldn't find any video modes to use.

Odd. I installed Sims and all expansions. Trying to run it gave me a
breif hourglass cursor, then nothing. I moved Sims.exe to another
directory and tested it there, and got what I expected, an error that
it couldn't find the data file. So, I moved it back, one more try at
running it...hourglass, then nothing.

Hmm. Planetside's 7-day trial installer gives me an I/O error.
Ragnarok Online crashes just before character select.

But, even after all this, EQ still runs fine. I've reinstalled the
video drivers, tried older drivers, uninstalled the card through the
device manager and reinstalled it. I'm running DX 9.0b. The video card
is a GeForce 4 Ti4200. DXDiag says everything passes its tests.... I'm
stumped.... I can provide a DXDiag dump if needed. No system changes
were made between the first time I ran D2 and when the problems
started...
