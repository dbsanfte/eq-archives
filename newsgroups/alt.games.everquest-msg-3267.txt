The Stein of Moggok is a great, fun, quest and a great way to make money.  I
have done the quest over, 70+ times.  I've done the quest in as long as two
days (when first started), all the way to last night 1 and a half hours (got
lucky with ports, all were free too no less).  My average time is about 2-3
hours.  Now which brings us to the price......why do I see people constantly
selling Stein of Moggok for 150pp!!  You can easily double that...I always
sell my steins for 275-300pp!  Now don't say its a new server or anyother
excuse, this is on Bristlebane.  Patience, do not drive the prices down.  If
only one crazy lowball seller see's this it will satisfy my mission!

I leave you all now with the thought of 300pp and I pour the contents of my
Stein of Moggok on my head, wetting it, in preparation for the flaming to
come.......
