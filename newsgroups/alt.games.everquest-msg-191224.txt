Eh, good point. Thank you Ben.  :) And it wasn't a typo, however...the
reply did take 2 hours to bounce, so chances are that a relay of some sort
is used, and that the machine housing his account is down, not that the
username is dead.  If the username was dead, it would bounce within
minutes, in my experience.

But this does beg the question...how is it that our folks over there are
allowed to have email?  It might help morale, but the security
implications are somewhat eyebrow-raising.
