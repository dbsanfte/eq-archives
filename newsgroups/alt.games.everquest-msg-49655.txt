Well, these guys are a bit weaker than some of the other suggestions, but
back when I had a Barbarian I couldn't wait to get my hands on the Vengeful
musicians. And I know many of my newbie sisters and brothers felt the same
way!
And Bunk Odon in Innothule is another one I'm dying to punish, but I haven't
seen him since the last time he jumped me at level 8-10 or so!  I have had
the pleasure of eating the flesh of the high elves that lurk in the swamp,
but no dwarf-dumplings as of yet.
