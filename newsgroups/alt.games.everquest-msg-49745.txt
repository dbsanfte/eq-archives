Endgames have been a problem for ALL MMORPG's including muds for years.
One thing that can happen is mudflation, gear becomes more powerful so
the encounters become harder, etc (eq resembles this one.)  Another is
end game is ALL pvp basically (DAOC).  The only massively multiplayer games
that have a good endgame are ones that don't really have a game as such 
at all (re: Mush's and other non level/skill based role playing environments - 
which I wouldn't exactly call games in the traditional sense.)

Okay, it's not that people hate PVP (some people love killing other people.)
It's a couple of other things.  Killing somebody in Quake (where they respawn
instantly and it takes about 5 seconds to run grab a powerup and be fighting
again at pretty much the same effectiveness as you ahd before you died is
way different from killing somebody in the bottom of a really rough dungeon 
where they're corpse can rot.  Also in item loot situations when you can take
an item off somebody that can take 20-50 hours of game time to reacquire
that's much much different.  Can you imagine what would happen if Quake had 
items you had to stay alive/work at for 20-30 hours to get, and then lost 
just because a grief player whacked you?)

One thing that nobody can test for is grief players.  One problem that alot
of the MMOG's so far have had is grief players (i.e. players whoose only 
reason to play/exist is simply to try and annoy other people as much as they
can.  These people existed in the mud world too and will continue to exist.

Muds tended to ban these people after a certain ammount of annoyance.  The real
question is will ANY pay to play game ban grief players after a certain level 
of annoyance or will they simply take the money and let them continue to annoy
the rest of the playerbase.  I'd say so far the companies would rather have
the money and let their playerbase get annoyed, than to actually do anything
about these people.  There are some possibilities on ways to deal with them,
but as can be seen with UO, Redserer eq, and other PVP games there are some
people that no matter what the game mechanics do, will continue to be grief
players.
