The mobs are outside chanter pbaoe stun level range (at 65). There is one
stun that can be bought with ldon points (650 in rakish i think) but it has
a 12 second recast time. Unless clerics have a high level aoe stun I am not
aware of aoe groups are effectively denied in ldon at 65th. If they goof up
and give chanters acess to another stun we could aoe nicely.
