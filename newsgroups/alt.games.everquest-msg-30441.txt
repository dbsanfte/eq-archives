What are some arguments against masterloot?  I, for one, think it makes the
most sense.  Coincidentally, I normally just play casters ( Chanter, Necro,
and used to play a Wiz ).  I just started a warrior, but have pretty much
soloed so far to lvl 9, so I haven't really been in group situations,
although I just relocated to Freeport and plan on hitting WC and EC.
