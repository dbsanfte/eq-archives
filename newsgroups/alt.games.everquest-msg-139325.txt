This is not the information I am attempting to capture.

With the Combat menu up, target a mob (say an Orc Pawn) in
melee range, and mouse click the attack button.  You will swing
and the button will grey out, like a spell icon thats not ready to
go again yet.  Wait a bit, it will flash up and down again, because
that isn't just "attack" its "autoattack" and will attack every time
it can.  Its grey during the weapon delay.  OK, now click attack
again.  Its still grey.  After the delay is up, it pops back up, like
a spell ready to cast again.  Click it, you attack right away on cue.
Click off.  Wait, Click when ready.  WOW, manual attack.

Why would you want manual attack?  Well if you are fear kiting,
for example you use this to swing only when target is in range,
they bounce around and unless you are quite good at it, keeping
constantly in melee range so you get every swing can be tricky.

But as a caster, there's a better reason.  Root that orc.  Attack.
Back up.  Sit down.  When your button ungreys, stand up, run
back in, attack, back out, sit again.  Watch your mana bar, hey,
its going up almost like you were medding the whole time!

Get a buddy with taunt.  Have him stand toe to toe with your
target, taunting to beat the band.  Now, don't bother with root
or backing up.  Just sit.  Stand swing sit.  Stand Swing Sit.
Every time it ungreys, you are ready to attack when you feel
like it.

Mana regenerates at regular intervals.  How much you get depends
ONLY on what you are doing at those intervals, not what you did
in between.  So, out of the six seconds between intervals, you
can be standing for 5 and a half, as long as you are sitting when
the regen instant hits, you will regen just as much as if you'd been
sitting all the while.

If you are watching your autoattack button, and stand swing sit
nice and quick, you'll be up only half a second per attack.  Odds
are you will not be standing during mana regen instant very often,
so you'll get almost as much mana back as if you did nothing.

Since lots of things screw with what window you have up, using
the Combat page to do this isn't practical, heck I don't think it
even has a sit/stand button anyway.  So you drag Attack to
one hotkey and Sit/Stand to another.  Clearly you want the
two buttons to be near each other, so consecutive numbers
are best.   And you'll be wanting attack as far as possible from
all other hotkey buttons, cause we know well (from before
remapping attack from the A key) how bad it is to accidentally
attack when you meant to do something else.  You need visual
confirmation, so (in the old UI) the 0 key is out.  That leaves
one choice only, the 1 key for attack, and naturally the 2 for sit/stand.

No, I didn't mean that, I don't think you can, looks like you have to
log out to switch, although you can issue the command in game, it
only applies when you next log in.

But in the old UI, you could use f10 to switch from original view
to HUD view (and to a useless no HUD view as well)  My point here
was that since the original view did not let you see the 7 thru 0 hotkeys,
you wouldn't want to put a visual confirmation button there.  Assist
-isn't- a visual confirmation button, so putting it in slot 7 thru 0 would
be fine, leaving 1 thru 6 for attack, sit, open inventory slots, clickable
item slots, and anything else you like that will give you status information

when visible.

If we all move to the new UI this placement issue vanishes, as it probably
did for high speed no lag connection people using the old UI in HUD mode

These two buttons -do- return information.  However, if you've automated
the two slots for left and right arrow, then the information isn't
interesting.
Clicky item and open inventory slots are far more useful.  If you are a HUD
or new UI only player, this caveat isn't so strong... so see my next
paragraph.

My pet will beat yours two falls out of three, unbuffed.

My pet will beat yours five falls out of six, self buffed

Your pet will beat mine 9 falls out of ten if you cast it
and buff it before we start the duel, since mine will
almost certainly be dead before I can slap a buff on it,
I can't cast it without a target!

And my pet cons higher than yours anyway!
