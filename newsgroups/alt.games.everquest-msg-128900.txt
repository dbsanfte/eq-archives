    I don't even think they can really figure out what not to do on future
encounters just by watching us. We kill off the Disciples when we do High
Priest, but don't kill off the offtank mobs when we attempt Emperor. A guild
that was just copying us would have no idea what to do with the adds in
Emperor if they only watched us on High Priest.
