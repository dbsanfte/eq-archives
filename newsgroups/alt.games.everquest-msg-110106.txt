You would think, then, that it could come to an agreement as to what

Temporarily united. And it didn't comprise all humans, or all human
cultures.

Listing things that human societies have in common doesn't change the
fact that they also have differences. You can list the commonalities
all day long, but the differences remain. After all, if there were no
differences, then no one would have considered slamming aircraft into
skyscrapers.

Ok, thanks, you've proven my point again. Specifically, that there is
no ultimate universal definition of "good" and "evil", but rather that
it's what people decide it is.
