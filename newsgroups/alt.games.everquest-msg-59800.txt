I think your only option is to buy the whole thing and install the Sims rpm
on your suse system. They're talking about a stand alone version of the Sims
(I don't want ot give up my Red Hat 7.2 system either), but I don't know if
that'll happen or not.

You can download and compile the binary yourself through SourceForge at

http://sourceforge.net/projects/winex

Although I've tried to do so without much success, but that comes from
really not knowing what I'm doing. I subscribed mainly to get the prebuilt
binaries and I want to see Transgaming and wine succede.

I can definitely see Verant doing something like this, though I hope they
either won't or can't.
