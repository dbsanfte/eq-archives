It looks like the newbie zone modifiers went away, perhaps with the
experience system changes back in January. After more digging, I found out
that the base ZEM used in ShowEQ is 75, and the numbers listed on the page
at http://eqzem.cjb.net/ are added to that 75 base. The "newbie" zones in
Freeport, GFay, and Nek Forest all are shown with a 0% bonus. Prior to being
nerfed, LOIO had a 33% bonus, resulting in a ZEM of 100. There were a few
posts on Hackersquest about the easy experience in LOIO being removed.

This is incorrect. GFay has a 75 ZEM, and Crushbone 80 ZEM. But, frankly,
can we really see the difference that 6.66% makes in our levelling? I doubt
it. On the other hand, I think that getting 33% more experience in LOIO
would have been noticeable.

I'm not trying to be the great arguer of ZEM's and whatnot. But, it seems
like many things about EQ are stated as "fact" over and over again when they
are not. Or, the information is out-dated. Heck, this may have all been
changed in the last patch, and only those people running ShowEQ (not me)
would know about it.
