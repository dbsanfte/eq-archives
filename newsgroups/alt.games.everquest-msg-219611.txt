Longer and happier, or just longer?  Dogs that my parents had fixed back
when I was growing up showed a marked difference in personality after being
fixed.  Yes, a little less aggressive (though the one "mean" dog that got
fixed stayed mean), but along with that the words "lethargic", "depressed"
and "aimless" come to mind.

I do understand not wanting more puppies.  I still don't agree with the
practice, as I think there are much better alternatives, such as simply only
keeping dogs that won't breed.  For those that insist that they must keep
the mommy cause they "love" her...  snip snip, love is a cold scalpel.  :P
Aren't you glad your wife doesn't love you that much?

I could go into my opinion of someone who would get a cat as a pet and then
let it run wild, but I can sum it up by stating that yeah, fixing a pet is a
good substitute for actual responsibility and care for an animal.  I excuse
the pound because, well, no balls is better than a hole in the ground.

I do have a cat.  I'm not speaking from a pet-hater perspective here.  On
the contrary, my opinion is if you can only handle 90% of the pet perhaps
you should wait until you are prepared to cope with all of the pet.  Or, to
put it another way, do you get pets fixed out of a courtesy to the pet or
out of convenience for you?
