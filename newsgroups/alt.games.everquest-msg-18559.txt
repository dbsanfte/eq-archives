Why fear before DOT?  Obvious really.  At higher levels if
you don't fear before DOT then pet dies and so do you
(unless you get Gate off in time).  Also I only use one DOT
myself (I don't count the Snare as a DOT here even though it
is).  Mostly I use VoS or Chilling Embrace even though I
have the level 44 Asystole spell.  Repeat as needed.

FYI this is all situation dependent.
