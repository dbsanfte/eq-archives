Generally, when people ask how good a class is for soloing, they don't
mean "after I get to level 54 and get my epic and have enough money to
burn peridots, how good is this class for soloing?".

Wizards are excellent soloers, but rangers are better, because rangers
become excellent at 22, and have more places where they solo at
maximum efficiency.
