    How did that turn into a problem? Was it swarming during GM events, or a
PvP-related issue, or what? Without a /who all zonename command, one of the
first steps in getting unused areas used has to be making travel easier for
players. Especially since generalized travel requires interacting with other
players (players that might not be available to help you) at present or
playing one of two classes.

    If you can come up with some way of compensating druids and wizards for
the loss to their usefulness by doing that, then I'd consider it.
