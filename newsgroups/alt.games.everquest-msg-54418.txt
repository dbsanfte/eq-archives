   I haven't noticed any 3 limit for mobs with BoF.  However, I rarely
get everyone grouped nicely to start with.  Generally I BoF singles
and do some running to organize them into a tight pattern.  Once they
all get in step Circle of Force usually works well to wear them down.

Quading is an art.  Start small.  Just one to get the pattern down and
make sure you have the rythm.  Then work your way up to more.  Resists
can prove fatal if you have too many.  Another thing is to make sure
of your target.  I've accidentally snared 2 different mobs.  They
don't all travel at the same speed so make sure you're snaring the
same kind of mobs.

As to where to kite... Anyplace with some open room works.  I've done
kiting in the open Karanas and also in the Frontier Mountains.  It
takes planning wherever you do it.  There is always the chance that in
kiting things around you'll run across something that aggros on you.
Keep root memmed!  Keep gate memmed! For what it's worth... Harvest
too for the emergency.  If you don't have JBoots keep a SOW potion
handy.  Lastly, since you are running around, keep the hotkey with
/loc ready because no matter how well you plan, eventually something
will go wrong.

Good luck and have fun.
