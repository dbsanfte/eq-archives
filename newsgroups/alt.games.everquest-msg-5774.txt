It was bragging, but the intent was to prove that we weren't playing
around with these jackasses. First real reason they give us, we'll
turn and do the same to them as was done to Zeppo. Sad part is, they
STILL think it's some stupid game. What they are doing is what's "so
ick".

I find it ironic that Sword and crew are criticizing ANYONE for being
"childish"... And even more so that they carry on by calling ME a
hypocrite... Methinks they're projecting a bit...
