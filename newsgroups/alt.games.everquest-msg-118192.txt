Kodiak Caves (3 is the best) in Great Devide, fast exp until low/mid 40's
then Rygorr Fort in Eastern Wastes (also giants in GD for low 40's)
High 40's try Scarlet Desert or the Rockhopper Caves in Dawnshroud Peaks
(both Luclin)

Dreadlands is a great place for exp it's also a great place for petty
bitching and general idiotic behaviour I don't blame you, in fact commend
you, for wanting to avoid it.
