The problem is that the ignore list is limited and as these guys get rep and
delete/create a new character, it gets to be more and more names in my
ignore list.  Seriously I have lately been ignoring 2 - 3 people in one day.
The other day I created a character named ripoffcasino and sat him down next
to some casino guy to try and make a point.  It did no good as far as I
could tell.
