Same here.

Hmmmm....what kind of places are these raids doing?  Most places I can think
that might have a sudden pick up raid are close enough to ports that I'd
just port to the Nexus, run to the Bazaar, and get my stuff from the bank,
and then port back.

I just have ordinary food/drink, and no bandages.  Otherwise, same.

I'm also lugging around the bottle for the KC part of the Concussion quest.
I really should look into finishing that sometime.

Also have my OS key, and my Fishbone earring.

If I ever see one for sale at a price I can afford, I'll get a Solist's Icy
Wand and carry that around, unless I manage to get lucky and get a Velious
quest robe first (my guild is starting to do HoT, so there's a chance of
getting the necessary components).  I really really want some way to finish
off mobs without using mana, for those situations where things just didn't
go right, and I'm OOM but the mob is nearly dead.  It doesn't happen often,
but when it does, it is annoying.
