Isn't there a seinfeild episode like this, where Elaine calls her friend to
ask if she has a crush on Jerry, only to find out she's been talking to the
friend's partner, who is a high-talker?

I dunno; I have no problem with people hearing my real voice or hearing the
voice of others. If i play a female toon, i don't want to have ppl crack
onto me, and I've been sexually harassed by people (presumably female) when
playing my male wood elf, which is totally disturbing and a good incentive
to stay in wolf form!

Iksar monks have got it good however. Noone gives a rat's about the sex of
an iksar ;-)

I've only rarely seen EQ played as roleplaying, especially in the last few
years. /o is standard. Also the game itself doesn't encourage roleplaying; i
mean POP has as it's primary goal the destruction of your own god, in many
cases.
