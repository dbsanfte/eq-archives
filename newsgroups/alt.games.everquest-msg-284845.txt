So, much to my surprise, and partially by luck, I'm still MT a fair 
amount of the time when my guild raids.  I'm not the only 60 SK in the 
guild, but the other two are, respectively, the guild leader, and the 
raid leader.  The guild leader serves as master looter and handles DKP 
bidding and so on, she's busy.  The raid leader is handling the myriad 
questions and complaints and command decisions of the raid, he's busy. 
That leaves me as highest level SK.  They also nominated me as class 
leader, a largely ornamental post (I didn't even get officer status) 
since SK don't normally need to coordinate their actions (clerics, 
shaman, enchanters; now there are some classes where the class leader 
has some work cut out for him).  And they are used to me MT'ing from a 
while ago, when I was far and away the highest level tank in the guild.

Now, I don't get MT post if the highest level guild warrior is 
available, even though he's still lower level than me (a condition that 
won't hold long, simply because 60 is the cap for quite some time to 
come).  The guild is convinced, and probably rightly so, that a Warrior 
is always going to be better on difficult mobs; nothing in my bag of 
tricks trumphs Defensive, plus the warrior class has all their 
Disciplines while SK get only Fearless and Resistant, and those only 
because they happen to be on the warrior tome vendor.  And since guild 
discipline is still somewhat lax, they prefer not to have one MT for the 
trash mobs and switch to a second for a boss.

BUT it turns out that warrior is frequently not there.  And that we 
dont' have a second warrior who's even close to MT ready.

There's one Paladin, he's hit 60 recently, and gets ST if I'm MT, 
probably gets MT on raids when neither I nor the warrior are there.

Eventually the guild will recruit some more warriors and I'll be 
relegated to the back of the tanking bus, but I'm enjoying my reprieve 
at the moment:)
