Damage output is a complicated thing.  It is indeed a good general rule
that dual weilding will outdamage two handers, but thats far from hard and
fast.

Early on, dual weilding is going to add very little damage, as it will
rarely "go off" which means that offhand weapon is just going to sit there
occupying space.  This (and plunking training points in) is the only way
to raise the skill though.  Worse, if you've been using a two hander
exclusively, your one hand weapon skills are going to suck, so even with
your primary weapon and the few times the secondary does work, you aren't
going to do as much damage as a skilled individual with the same weapon
would.   This isn't crippling at 13 by any means, but its reason enough to
get to work now instead of waiting till it becomes important.

What is more important, dual weilding tends to out aggro two handers.
This means that having a compliment of both styles available is the best
plan; dual wield when you want the mob to focus its attention on you, two
hander when someone else is supposed to take the beating.

As a warrior, you will usually want the mob hitting you, so making sure
you have the most annoying weapon choice available is actually more
important.  Interestingly, warriors aren't really relied on for massive
damage, its more important for you to concentrate on annoying weaponry
than it is damage, even!

Following further along those lines, rather than looking specifically for
high damage weapons, you might look into their annoyance factor, this
means short delay weapons with procs.  Every time you hit you move a
little higher on the hate table, every time a proc goes off you move
higher as well (except for a few procs that actually reduce hate, but I
cant think of a warrior usable weapon that does, offhand)
