While that does seem like the way they'd get solved, most quests are 
apparantly solved in a very different way; thousands of people reporting 
drops and new spawns into a central location like Allakhazam, and trying 
various things, and then reporting successes.

Sort of like climbing Mt Everest, for three people to reach the top 
something on the order of 3600 people worked bringing in supplies and 
estabilishing and running the various base camps on the way up.

But once a quest is solved, its usually not a question of the couple 
people telling a friend or two and gradually the info spreading out till 
it hits a board;  the information is posted to the same board the 
researchers were using to figure out the quest in the first place, sort 
of like scientists publishing their results; the bragging rights of 
being the first to post a solution are the principle reward; few if any 
quests are actually worth doing at any level, and fewer still are worth 
the time spent by high level researchers trying to crack them in the 
first place.
