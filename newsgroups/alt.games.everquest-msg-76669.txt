Most higher level players know they can buy bats wings in EC for a
couple GP per stack, however, it's a hassle for many to run over there,
so many casters simply buy them from lower level players for between 3
and 5pp a stack.
I made a lot of plat selling them with my woodelf Druid and for some
time I'd travel by boat from Faydwer to Antonica and travel to East
Commons to buy a full load of them, then gate to Kelethin and sell them
for 3 to 5pp a stack.

Now as a Lv 31 Druid, I'm so busy sometimes that when I port in to a
Druid Circle, and am low on wings, I'll shout buying wings for 3pp a
stack just cause I'm too lazy to run to EC and 3 or 5pp is peanuts to me
now.
