I don't enjoy xp grinding, it bores me to tears. That's why I spend about
an average of 3 weeks per level on each post-50 level so far (except 51, I
did that in a single night on the oh-so-abuseable rygorr oracle that has
since been removed).

If you fail to reach level 40 in 2 years, there is some extraordinary
reason for it, because level 40 is pathetically easy to reach.
