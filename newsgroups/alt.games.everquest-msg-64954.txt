> Has IBM fucked me again? Is this some proprietary hardware bullshit

Jazz, not to sound like a jerk...but this something you should know before
buying the computer... if it's also something that is in question, you check

but sorry, you screwed yourself, but this is how learning in the computer
world is.....
