Oh god, I hope you're wrong.  If you're right I feel bad for the guides/GMs 
and all the more petitions they'll get for name requests once folks see the 
' names.

My provisioner gave himself the lastname of "Hunterofthyme" just for a joke 
'cause I thought I read somewhere that I could change it weekly (like in 
EQ).  When I found that wasn't the case I petitioned myself saying that my 
name violated the naming rules.  Within an hour or so the guide confirmed it 
was a violation.  He said he couldn't erase it, just change it, so have an 
alternate in mind.

Oddly, /lastname Weevil was denied one of my characters. :(  ("Ceeno Weevil" 
is what I wanted it to be).
