I am looking to find these characters on the Bristlebane server. Charmility
(warr) or Chroksiss (Rng). Last night we agree on a deal for my Silken Whip
of Ensnaring and we agreed on 4kpp was a fair price. She claimed that her
Rng character already had a whip. Item is lore, so I agreed to give her Warr
the whip and she would log on as the Rng and give me the cash. Next thing
you know she doesn't log on... stayed on for 3 hours waiting no luck..

Just a warning to all you other peeps on Bristlebane. Beware. I know I
shouldn't have clicked trade! I should have gotten something for value to
hold. That's what I get for trusting someone that I don't know. If any of
you have any info on these characters or the guild that they might be in
please give me a email or tell in game. Thanks!
