   On Drinal it's NFP.  Gfay and Ecom to a certain
small extent, but nothing like NFP.
    It was actually a bit shocking to run there on
FV.  It felt so quiet and empty.  I should imagine 
that will change one people actually have something
to sell, though.  No chance of EC becoming an
auction zone, after all.

Annie  <--- Doesn't have any money to shop on FV, anyways.
