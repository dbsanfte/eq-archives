A thousand monkeys banging on keyboards posted the following under the
name "Charles Whitney" <cbillingsw@yahoo.com>:

It's quite possible that House himself doesn't understand jack shit of
what he's talking about (like many managers), and is trying to pass
along a plan that people under him are going to implement without
knowing the details behind it. That would explain poor use of terms on
his part.

We will see what Sony meant eventually.
