The true strength of a wizzie in a group is not damage per second, but 
damage *in* a second.

The monk (my main is, for one ;) will be a constant damage generator, 
stopping only when there are no engaged mobs or he has to feign off aggro 
to help the tank tank. The wizard spends most of his time on his ass. The 
true value of the wizard, though, is when something absolutely positively 
must be dead right this instant. I can honestly say that my bacon has been 
saved by a well-placed DD spell almost as often as by evac (which is 
another major wizzy contribution).
