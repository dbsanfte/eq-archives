He's a Dark Elf, and I actually saw him (and his friends).
Once.  Very briefly.

Here's my earlier post detailing that debacle:

#### Start of old post

A while back my (then 49) Paladin was soloing in Kith at night
(quite a rush, by the way), and when daytime came I was relaxing,
as usual, by the WC zone tunnel, waiting for the next nightfall.
Usually nothing more dangerous than a Bixie jumped me there
in the daytime.

Except this time, I see what looks for all the world like a
Dark Elf marching band -- about 5-7 DE's, closely spaced,
approximately two abreast, playing follow-the-leader, and
WALKING not running like they would have been if someone had
trained them to the zone accidentally.

I had just enough time to ask myself, WTF???, when they saw me,
turned, and I was dead before I even had time to rise to a
standing position.

Here's my log of that death.  Note the total elapsed time
from the first aggro to the "you have been slain"
message:  Two seconds flat (and 1740 HP):
