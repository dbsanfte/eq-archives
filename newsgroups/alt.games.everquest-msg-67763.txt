Profitable, probably none.  Best, well, what do you think you will have fun
sinking money into as a hobby?  I have more or less broken even on smithing,
got it up to 140ish.  I have lost a little money on baking, but had an
almost neverending supply of food for all my characters as a result.  I have
reduced the cost of my arrows with my ranger by making his own.  I have made
tons of money on Alchemy, shaman only skill though.  Jewelry can be
profitable, eventually, for an enchanter, or someone who is really good
friends with an enchanter.  Brewing, well, if you are going to do the
Thurgadin shawl quests, I think you need it along with most others.
Tailoring, it's a royal pain in the butt, as most components are mob drops,
not bought from vendors, but can be profitable, eventually, maybe.

All that being said, my shaman is a master smith, master baker, 80ish in
alchemy, and in the 40s in brewing and tailoring.  My ranger is a master
fletcher.  Master being 100+ in a skill.  My shaman funds his other habits
with sow potions.
