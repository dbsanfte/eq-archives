Yeah, I know.

Keep in mind, the guild I am in has one 60 druid, one 60 cleric (no epic),
one or two 59s (druid, enchanter), a scattering of 56 through 58 of various
classes (shaman, monk, cleric, ranger, druid, enchanter), a fair number of
50 through 55 of most classes.

We have never done VS, only VSR.

I think we have one wizard in the guild, maybe level 51.  In our alliance,
add another one or two wizards of similar level.  I can probably drag in one
or two more wizards levels 57 and 59.

That's nice, but not too helpful.  With our alliance, we can scrounge up 60
druid, 60 cleric, 60 paladin, 60 shaman (not original player, no clue how to
play shaman I believe).

Sounds good, where on the wimp scale?  Compared to the protector say.

Good to hear.

Having never done either Vox or Naggy, that is meaningless to me.

Never been to VP, don't have the key.  I just listed all the spots that
Allakhazam's lists that it drops.

I've heard that.  How tough is he though?  We do have some warriors that
would like a shot at him someday.

I had never heard of him before I saw this list.

I know, the problem is raising that kind of cash, and not blowing it all on
tradeskills.  I am perpetually broke, as in, less than 100pp to my name.
Every time I get a few pp, I blow it on raising tradeskills.
