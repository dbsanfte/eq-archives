I use macros constantly for stuff, well not constantly but I use them for
anything important. Fact is people dont read the stuff 90% of the time. I
was in a group and had to root stuff and had been doing so and had been
using my macro which used capital letters no less and the paladin was
complaining "if you root stuff you should say so" and I was like "I am!" in
fact when I root stuff I spam my macro about a dozen times till they back
off. Same thing with other stuff like when I complete heal, the macro pops
up and says "I am complete healing so and so" and 4 seconds later some other
fool says hes complete healing the same person. Today on a raid I said
"Casting MGB HoV" and a minute later another cleric said "MGB HoV INC". He
did that twice too.

Whats the goddamn point of using a macro if no one reads it?
