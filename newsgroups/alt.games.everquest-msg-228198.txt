Amen to that.

Hardest thing about PvP is starting out with basicaly nothing and
continuously running into the heavily twinked griefers you cant even
hit. I liked playing on the Zeks from time to time, had a lot going
for them. But that one point that there were no consequences to PK
made it all but impossible to ever get out of the poor house. Rath was
a PKers wet dream, lots of plat and mobs to keep players distracted.
Although one good thing was rogues were killed on sight ;)

So I would add to your suggestions that any game ment to be PvP should
limit the advantage of equipment or add kill shot chances that dont
take AC or Resists into consideration. Then at least there would be
some risk to griefing the noobs. After all even a 98lb weakling can
get lucky....
