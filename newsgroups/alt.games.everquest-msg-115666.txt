Oh, and sort of as a follow-up to my other post, remember that "not very
much at all" means different things to different people. My warrior just
finished a massive tradeskill push and my bank account is down below 1
KPP for the first time in twenty levels or more. I consider myself
damned near broke at this point and need to raise some cash. Of course,
I could still cough up 20 plat for a port. Hell, I gave 100 to a wizard
in Seb for a TL out.
