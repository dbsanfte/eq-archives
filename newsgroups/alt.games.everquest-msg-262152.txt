I'm looking to upgrade and have currently saved 5 k. Currently my 57 monk is
wearing a mantle of absorption (ac 8, str 3, sv vs cold 8, vs magic 4, wt
1); I'm at 17 wt so i don't want to go any further over but everything i can
find in the bazaar seems heavy. The bonespur mantle is light and reasonable
but the cermonial hate amice has slightly better resists and unfortunately
is heavy (1.2!).

Apart from that the next items are the barbed Dragonscale (2.5, ouch) and
barded rubicite (2.5 wt and 30 k ouch ouch).

If there are any monks out there can they give me some advice? I had a look
at monkly business but a lot of the articles seem frozen in the luclin era
(related to yantis takeover perhaps??) and assume you are in a raiding guild
and weight is not an issue because you will not be the main tank or your ac
is already maxed by getting raid gear (which is unlikely for me ever, due to
time limited lifestyle).
