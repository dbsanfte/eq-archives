 I considered the satellite option some time ago and learned that in
addition to the satellite receiver equipment you also need a separate
land line to a separate ISP for uploads, meaning say, you are using your
browser and click on a link... the request is sent over the land line
to the separate ISP and you receive the download (at satellite speeds)
through your receiver dish. I'm not sure how this would work for EQ
and other internet gaming. This also may have changed in the recent
past, I'm not entirely sure. I opted for cable.
