Had my bard in a group last night in KC (got my singing steel
gauntlets-WOOT! EB!!!) and charmed a Spectral Caller to help pound down the
train that got dropped on us.  I charmed him 4 or 5 times during the *long*
battle until he was the only one left.  I don't think one of my group
realized he was charmed and started wailing on him at that point.  Then
everyone did.  Then I started whacking it when I realized their blows were
connecting.  I figured charm must have broken, but it wasn't fighting back
and right before it died I got the "your charm spell has broken" message.
I am assuming this is a bug, but is this known to happen often?  I've been
charming for 25 level now and this is a first for me.

Sean...
