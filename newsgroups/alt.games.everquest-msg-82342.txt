I need some assistance... (details)

1. My system hangs after choosing my server "Povar" and clicking "Play 
EverQuest". Monitor flickers twice, then it is blank (black). Have to reboot.
After this, some EverQuest files are corrupt. :(

2. I have attempted to go to the Support page on EverQuest.com, but the page 
only partially loads and just hangs. Double :(

3. I am attempting to get assistance to help debug this problem, but I can't 
get to the support page on EverQuest.com! Triple :(

4. I am running Windows 98 SE, I have a Rage Fury Pro\XTest 200 Pro AGP 
Graphics Accelerator with 32 MB of RAM. Again, I can connect and go through 
the intro and file update scanning without a hitch, but, I choose my server 
and click "Play EverQuest" and my system hangs.

I am just attempting to get some sort of assistance to help debug this 
problem as I cannot get the support page on EverQuest.com to fully load.

I have reinstalled my video card driver, no help there, same symptom.

As an aside, I have EverQuest running on a different system running Windows 
98 SE with a PNY Verto Graphics Accelerator with 64 MB of RAM without a 
problem. However, on this system, I also cannot get the support page to fully 
load.

Any assistance to help debug this would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks for listening.
