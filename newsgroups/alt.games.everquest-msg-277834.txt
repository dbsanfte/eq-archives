A thought occurs to me...this might be a "test" that will benefit them
either way it goes. If people come out in favor of this, then they'll
have a new source of revenue. If an overwhelming number come out
against it, they'll have the proof they need that they won't be
alienating their customers by turning around and going after places
like IGE legally (which I suspect is one of the biggest holdups).
