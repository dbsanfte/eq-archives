Swap spell (usually something to amuse myself with like UHOF)
Supernal Elixer
Supernal Remedy
Complete Heal
Swap spell (usually a group heal)
Swap spell (usually Virtue)
Divine Barrier
Divine Aura

But thats of almost no use to you at all, because tactics and situations are so
radically different at 65 than they are at 42.

DA and DB are there almost all the time because they take so long to pop back up
after use, and in raid (and even group) situations they get used tactically to
dump aggro on bad pulls or overheal aggro.  While I rarely use both, having both
memmed means I can use one freely, knowing I'll still have the other for
emergencies.

The heal layout is wacky, each of those heals costs exactly the same.  I have
enough mana pool and regen going that 400 mana spells are just something to toss
out as needed, and situations where I wish I had something cheaper memmed are
rare... there's always the swap slots for that if it comes to it.

Supernal Remedy is my "fast heal", up till your 50s this will be your second
largest heal most of the time, that tends to be faster and take less mana, but
is usually less efficient and smaller than your "best" heal.

Complete Heal... well you got that spell at 39 but its really not useful for the
most part on people with small HP totals, and your mana pool and regen rate are
probably such that using it heavily will really only work as a nice fast way to
empty your mana pool out.  I wouldn't even mem it unless you have someone in
your group with a really massive HP total (say 3000 or more)... then again
perhaps in the modern twink era thats more likely at lower levels than it once
was.    Funny thing is, up over 60 I started using this spell less and less, the
technically smaller SR and SE end up doing the job well enough and without the
massive cast time of CHeal, plus other heals are affected by the various focus
items and AA abilities that CHeal is immune to.  Starts as a specialty tool,
becomes main heal in your 50s, and then gets phased back down to specialty tool
at the later end of the game.

Supernal Elixer is the grown up version of a spell your celestial spell  that
works as a reverse DoT, or HoT: "Heal over Time".  Instead of hitting the target
and instantly jolting his HP up, it hits and heals a bit, then next tic a bit
more, next tic a bit more...  These tend to be a better buy in terms of HP per
mana than your other spells, but there's more to them than that.  They tend to
do a lot less aggro than any other heal, more like just buffing your target
would.  Cast before a mob aggros on the target there's no aggro at all, but the
heal keeps hitting.  Cast when the target isn't hurt enough to make full use of
the heal, you probably still don't waste much of the potential, since your
target probably keeps taking more damage and getting healed back up from the
subsequent ticks.  Sadly, they added one or two lower level versions of this
spell line for clerics, (I'm guessing you are using one of those now) but
looking at the mana to heal ratio they aren't favorable at all, and are reserved
for special use.  The 44 and (high 50s?) ones, though, will be main stay healing
for a good many levels.

I also used to keep my biggest (non CHeal) heal memmed, but I don't currently
have Supernal Light, and Supernal Remedy is better than every other heal out
there in addition to being very fast.

Group heals are a specialty tool for most of your levels, there are a few times
or places when they are just the thing... but not all that many.  Post 60,
though, you can get an AA that allows you to spread your party's damage out over
the group evenly, this makes a group heal a very mana efficient tool.  I don't
-need- to keep a group heal here in most situations, but it does come in handy
enough that its my default.

I tend to keep Virtue memmed, because people die and need it replaced often
enough to make it the lazy decision.  I've almost never cast it as an emergency
response, and can give up that swap slot to something else without a qualm.

"Fun slot" I can -definately- give up when needed, and whats there will rarely
make any real difference in a fight.  Once upon a time Flash of Light or Root
would live here as my getaway cards, with Run 3 the need for this largely
vanishes.

So that makes 4 slots I can give up to stuns if the situation warrants it: Fun,
Virtue, Group Heal, DB (in that order, least important to most important).  With
4 stuns and bash there's not much chance a stunnable mob is going to get a spell
off.  Only worth doing if the mob really absolutely -has- to be prevented from
casting at all.

Soloing, I ditch Complete heal and mem 3 stuns and UHOF.  UHOF and cleric melee
do the killing while the stuns stop casts or give me time to heal myself up as
needed, I rarely cast anything but the first couple stuns as most mobs don't
chain cast.  I'm never going to have time to Cheal myself with a mob beating on
me, so its gone.
