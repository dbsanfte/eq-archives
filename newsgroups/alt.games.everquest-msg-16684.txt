    I remember you telling this story.  The other day, I think I encountered
your "friend."

    I am the last character on the planet capable of getting them who didn't
have a pair of Icetooth claws.  So I finally get a set (I didn't win the
loot role, everyone else in the party had a set, and they're lore).
    So, being a wizard, I figure, I'll just sell them... Off to NFP.  Asking
a whopping 200 plat.

dumbass: "How much you asking?"
Me: "I was thinking 200 plat."
dumbass: "I'll give you 100."
Me: "No thanks... I have a friend I'll give them to.  But I figured I'll try
to get 200 for them instead."
dumbass: "I'll give you 150 but that's as high as I'll go."
Me: "No thanks."  and I gate to GFay.
Me: /Auction Icetooth Claws...
instant tell hell from the dwarven warriors who want them... at 200 they're
sold to the fastest typist... who could type in english ("d00d, $ ?" didn't
get a reply)
I finally had to /auction "Sorry, my icetooth claws are already sold."

dumbass /tells me from NFP: "Fine, I'll go 175."
me: "my price is 200."
I collect my 200 from the guy in GFay... with him giving me much hearty
thanks.
dumbass: "That's okay, I found a guy selling them for 100."
me /tells dumbass: "My asking price to you is now 500."

I know they're more common than they used to be, but the stats suggest 200
plat... and my warrior friends seem to think this is a good deal.

I will say this, spending the extra time in NFP waiting for dumbass to
figure out that my asking price was a fair minimum did make me extra money,
as I collected about 200 plat in fares for translocate to DL, NK, and GFAY.
So I guess I made 200 for the claws, and 200 for suffering an idiot.
