It looks like you'll be able to avoid PvP if you want.  Each realm has
two big regions.  Call them the inner region and the outer region.
You can level up to mid level entirely in the inner region.  Between
the inner region and outer region are many strong NPC guards.  Between
the outer region of your realm and the outer regions of neighboring
realms are strong NPC guards (not as strong as the ones that protect
the inner region).

Your realm's artifacts are in the outer region, near the inner region.

What this means is that it will be very hard, if not impossible, for a
PK force to reach your realm's inner region.  So, for the first half
of the game, you are very safe.

In the outer region, it will be possible for a large organzied force
from another realm to invade your realm.  You can then be PKed.
Because of the need to get past the strong NPC guards, this should
take a big enemy force, so this won't be an everyday event.  It will
be kind of like a GM event on EQ.

This is what I've read, anyway.  Personally, my highest character in
the beta is level 5 at the moment, and has not been too far from
Camelot.

BTW, in the last patch message, they announced that the NDA
restrictions on talking about the game are lifted, so we should start
hearing more.
