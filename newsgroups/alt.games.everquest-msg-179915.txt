Not suffering at all, I can count on two fingers the number of times I
have referred to Magelo. It's not a site I have any use at all for. I
just mentioned it in case he was interested, and then would know to use
IE. If a site programmer wants to design specifically to one browser,
then who am I to argue, especially since IE, to my regret, does have the
lion's share of the browser market right now. Each to their own, it
would be a very boring and uninteresting world if everyone conformed to
what the rich powerful business people wanted.
