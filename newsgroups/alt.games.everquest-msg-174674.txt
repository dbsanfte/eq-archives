Taper off is one thing.   I don't think you really understand the drastic
reductions in exp per kill that happen 60+.   Personally, I think when they
added the 61 plus levels, they went back to thier old plan for "Level
bonuses / penalties"... the one that was removed a week after it went in for
under 60's, due to public outcry.   Not only do you get a bonus for
attacking "high blues" and above... you get a penalty for attacking low
blues.  Even before they turn light blue, you're losing the majority of the
experience on it, (even though it sitll hits multiple times for 500, and can
 generally rip you a new one).... and once it is light blue, between the
level penalty and the 50% reduction from light blue, you might be getting
about 10% of the mob's base exp value (which isn't all that high to begin
with since it's low level).

At level 65, in Innovation, the *entire* front of the zone is light blue,
with a sprinkling of green.  Only the factory area (prototype rooms) is full
blue (level 59 to 60 mobs) and thats only big enough to support one group.
Nightmare is only slightly better, with the Hobgoblin caves being "decent"
experience, and usually uncamped.  About two groups could fit in there,
three at the most, without trampling each other.

For most of us we leveled up in the first tier zones, until we were able to
beat them.  I personally went all the way to 65 before getting flagged,
although we could likely have done it at 63 (our group's enchanter was
working massive overtime, and we didn't want to do the trial asking the
druid to bot him.)


As for why they "couldn't"... well, that was our question a lot of the time.
My favorite response was from the ranger (same one that claimed it was all a
conspiracy against her) who said that she shouldn't have to level beyond 60,
because if she did without getting flagged, she ran the risk of being
"trapped in only 4 zones with good exp".   As you can imagine, this garnered
little sympathy from the people who had leveled all the way to 65 while
being "trapped" in only those same 4 zones, and generally served to piss
them off instead.
