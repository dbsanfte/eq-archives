Its impossible to say.  Noone knows anything about EQ2, nor about what will
become of EQ when its released.

On the other hand, I can say that EQ is available now, while EQ2 won't come out
for many months to come, if not -years- or never; there's a common phenomenum in
the computer gaming world called Vaporware (stuff thats advertised but never
ends up getting released)

There's no earthly way of knowing which direction we are going but the danger
must be growing 'cause the rowers keep on rowing and they certainly aren't
showing any signs that they are slowing.

If you want a guess, EQ2 will come out next July, Half the EQ players will jump
ship at that point, then half of those players will return to EQ.  EQ will live
happily for about a year after that point, but SOE will stop supporting it with
new releases, and continue to add new content to EQ2 along with fixing all the
major screwups it was released with, and gradually people will move to EQ2,
leaving EQ as an orphan which will continue to limp along (possibly with server
movelogs crushing multiple servers together) for about 5 more years.  After
that, SOE will end EQ altogether, and the game will live on only in player run
hacked servers, or possibly SOE will yeild to pressure and release an "open
code" version of the game.

This is no more than a guess on my part, though, as there's never been a MMRPG
out there with EQ's level of success, so we don't have any precedents to work
with.

As an aside, words in all caps are considered SHOUTING, and unless you normally
converse by screaming certain words in the ears of your buddies, you might want
to take it down a notch on usenet.
