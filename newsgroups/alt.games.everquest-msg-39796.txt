As I understand it, most of the information on mob xp, xp to level, etc.
comes from people who have used ShowEQ to actually see the numbers.  I don't
have any experience with the program, so I can't verify that personally.
Not to mention, even if I did, it would be kind of stupid to admit it in
public with my character and server info posted here.  Most of what I've
seen regarding that seems to indicate that all mobs of the same level in the
same zone give equal xp.  Which is something like level of mob squared times
zone modifier times class modifier (to remove the class penalties).
