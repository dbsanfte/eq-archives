Petrify-  is THE best root for conjurers.  It's actually a stun.  The
purpose of this spell is to stop be mob from hitting you while your pet
reaquires aggro.  When in groups it is your job to use it for crowd control
when the tanks/enchanters need an extra few seconds to get a mob under
control.

It does not break for me no matter how many times the mob gets hit.  It's a
static duration.  The other 'root' spells are poor substitutes even in adept
forms.  My necro is 36 and the only time I use them is when my stuns are off
line due to recast/resists.

Solo Content-  I have a 36 necro and a 36 sk in eq2 and both can take lvl 40
mobs with total ease.  My 38 cleric (INQ) finds thing equally doable.  I've
soloed my sk and my necro for about 1/4 of the time I've played them.  At 36
I have more then 325 quests completed per char...all unique...if repeatable
quests counted I'm sure that number would be x4 of that at least. Generally
if I need a group for a quest I find one.  EQ2 is 100% quest driven.  People
will say thing's like "I don't xp, I only quest.'  Even if I'm grinding on
turtles or something equally dull I can find at least 1 or 2 quests to do at
the same time.  Lvl 1-20 are so completely easy to solo.  Most players pass
up the grouped areas long before they realize they are there.

The reason people complain about 20+ being a wall is because that's the
first chance they get to leave the newbie zones.  Commonlands is a newbie
zone.  I don't consider Nek to be one.  Mobs are tougher and smarter cause
it's time for you to grow up and become what ever it is that you've chosen
for your class.  Mages won't want to melee anymore and cleric actually have
to use wards/heals in fights.

Also at those lower lvls it's a common thing to run up on another player
killing what you are after and to form an impromptu 2-3 man group.  The
purpose is to complete the quest faster and not compete with other players
for spawns.  Once you hit those advanced zones things are alot more open and
less bottle necked...they aren't holding your hand anymore.  You have to
start learning where to go and what's the safest way to move there.  SOE has
facilitated solo ALOT... you can see their work all the way up to the lvl 40
mobs.  They've busted up group encounters in outdoor zones in almost ever
area.  There will be group spawns there, but along side them will be plenty
of solo roamers to pick off.  EQ1 and EQ2 share in one thing about zone
design...most outdoor zones are shifting to alot of solo content...alot.
The indoor zones tend to be 100% group encounters and quest to match.
