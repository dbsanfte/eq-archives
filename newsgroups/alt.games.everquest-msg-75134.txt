Naw. It's an easy fix. Just make them exactly like the nexus scions. Go
ahead and whack him, exploiter. Now he double hits back for 2400 a
crack. Lot's of luck. Oh, and he gives no xp and no drops if you DO
manage to kill him, and you become KOS to all soulbinders, POD's, and
Nexus Scions immediately.
