Hi:

I suppose I knew this time would eventually come, but as I'm a soling Wizard
at heart I thought I'd ask here in the hope of maybe finding a new hunting
area, as sadly EW is nearly totally green to me at 55. I've also been
hunting in the Ocean of Tears killing light blue seafurys but my progress is
rather slower than I'd like. To me, EW was simply perfect, a large outdoor
area, and plenty of mobs. This is where I learned to quad-kite, something I
enjoy doing a lot.

I don't really like Burning Woods (or Emerald Jungle) due to the high number
of trees slowing my framerate down.and Cobalt Scar is usually too busy.
Dungeons are way too dangerous to solo due to unwanted trains .. so
basically .. my question is .. where would be a great place to solo,
outdoors, and maybe get from 55 to 60? Experience doesn't have to come
*really* quickly, I'm happy to grind out my levels, though I truly am bored
in the Ocean of Tears. I've sat and studied EQAtlas for a good time tonight,
but nothing really stands out as being the obvious place for me to go ..

As always, thanks for any help I might be given here, safe hunting to you
all ..

Stevie. (Stormhammer)
