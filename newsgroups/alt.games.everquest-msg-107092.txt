Only outrageous weapons like that get a recommened level "nerf." They
are not the kind of gear or weapons that your average twinker will be
using. I think that particular weapon procced a 180 dd or something
starting at level one. Meanwhile, they've never nerfed my 2 handed
drakkel icegrinder giant hammer from velious that is 45 spd 27 damage
and does that 30 damage or so ice rend dd. It also procs at level one
and is a pretty common weapon. The difference is that it is 45 spd so
its not setting off any nerf alarms, though its 2 hand sword version
does not do the same proc until 30 (the drakkel icereaver) 45 spd
makes it a pretty bad weapon until level 20 on a melee type.

There is really no need to therefore be alarmed, most items are not
going to get this retro nerf while a 24 spd 11 damage weapon will be
giving even a level 1 good damage though its under the cap AND the
proc worked at one. They could have just changed the proc to work at
level 30 instead.
