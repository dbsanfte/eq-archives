The nerf never actually impacted me all *that* much.  This isn't arguing for
the fun of it, this is arguing for the sake of the "lesser" monks that I saw
get demolished by it.

I never did much tanking.  I did tank Gozzrem (with 5k hp at the time) in
the days right after the nerf to show that it didn't do what it was implied
as the reason for doing it.  Nowadays I have a bit under 12k hp, a pocket
cleric, and sometimes a pocket shaman.  I tank just fine.  =)

I'll accept that as your realization that my viewpoint was valid, and now I
just shouldn't worry about it.  It's not like I'm picketing, it was a post
on usenet.  =P
