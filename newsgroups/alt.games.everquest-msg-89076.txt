LOL. What' with people suggesting me soloing stuff anyway?

This weekend we were having yer average Kael raid of normal stuff. Whenever
I struck the killing blow I'd
/say giants vs. Rhand, 0 : x
where x was the number of giants I slew so far.
After about 10 or 11 kills people went around telling that the next pull
would be soloed by me ;)

Only did a few greenies on the way out, but still. Maybe I ought to get a
few guildmages together and kill a mob or two just to show off.


ps. I wouldn't even think of joining a raid against AoW or Tormax or such
yet.
