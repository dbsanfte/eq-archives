No ;) Ranger DS doesn't stack, and I have yet to meet people who want
ranger buffs over BL buffs, like spiritual purity and their ATK/HP lines.

But... This isn't necessarily a problem with the BL buffs; and I'm not
convinced rangers are particularly hurting. The problem is that the BL
does so well in so many areas compared to other classes that are weak
in some areas and strong in others. If you take a single aspect of BL's
and compare it to the best class everything may look fine -

Look! Shamans slow better than us!
Rangers buff + heal almost as well as us!
Mages do a bit more DPS than us!

... etc ...

But... all these other classes do pretty much *one* thing well; BL's
are competing with ALL of them at a very comparable level. Thats where
the problem lies. You break the Support/Dps/Tank paradigm by being...

everyting.

Sure; but if you're main slower and buffer, screw it, we can do
without the shaman, we'll have the cleric pacify pull so lets drop
the enchanter, and hey, we get so much more DPS from the extra
DPS classes and your pet, etc, that we dont miss their 'better' skills
because the mobs are dead before that extra DPS they have from the
small slow difference or lack of long duration mezzing can make a
difference.

I've been in groups where we've said 'Nah, dont ask the shaman - we already
have the BL' ;)

I've been in groups in PoFire and DoN with BL tank/slowers.

*shrug*

And also an issue rangers face ;)

And its not just 'second best DPS' or whatever; its second best at
a whole lot of things in one toon.

I tend to agree; if someone else is having fun , good for them. At
the end of the day if the beastlord means a shaman isnt invited,
then it means an extra rogue *is*; you're not reducing the total
size of groups.

Just dont expect the shaman to be happy about it ;)
