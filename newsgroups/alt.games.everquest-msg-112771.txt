Good point -- I came to Norrath to role play -- I came to Fironia Vie
because I was getting damn sick of the North American Male Teenage Idiom

 (Rangers SUCK Druids ROCK. Let's go to the commanland and kick orc BUTT and
anyway I want to twink by Druid and my 59th Level BADASS Paladin is there
and then I will have the Sword of buttkicking Astral Damage and a suit of
AC50 Ethereal Angel Armour that my Paladin looted off Goodly Highelf, savior
of Faydark....)

So I would lighten up on the language (I mean I am level 21 and can't
understand anything but my native language) and I do not want to POWER LEVEL
my languages.

So anyway, is Everquest Evil?
