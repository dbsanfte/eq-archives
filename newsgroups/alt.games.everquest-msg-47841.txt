They have stated that after release resources would be devoted 60/40
to RvR and then PvM until the RvR game is balanced then they will
focus on adding PvM, high end unique mobs etc.  

When you go into the arena in EQ do you get upset if someone kills you
in the pvp area? By all accounts it will be extremely hard, maybe
impossible for enemies to get into the home realms. If you go into the
frontier then you know anyone who doesn't have a name over their head,
anyone who looks different, is an enemy.  There's no ganking because
you chose to go to the pvp area.  You don't lose exp when killed by
players. You don't lose items. You may lose realm points depending on
if they implement that in a server (there is a big call for it as a
specialized server) all you do is pop back to your last bind point.
