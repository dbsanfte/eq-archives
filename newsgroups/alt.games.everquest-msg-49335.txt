I've taken short breaks a few times - usually prompted by a heavy
travel schedule.

I'm sort of taking a break right now. I was getting geared up to try
AO, then I read all the negative reviews about it. I'm considering
trying DAoC too, but that might not happen now either - I've just
started playing BGII again. I hadn't fired it up on the new machine
before, and really enjoyed about four straight hours the other day. I
may just stick with that for awhile, and come back to EQ in force when
I finish BGII.

Excellent advice. It's never a good idea to focus too much on one
activity, regardless of what it is.
 

Hope we'll still see your smiling face around here once in awhile
while you're in sabbatical.
