I'll have ta look again; looked in tha bazaar, but couldn't find me one.
800p I can handle, hopefully tha one fer Kaladim will be tha same.

As fer LDoNs, I've been doin' a lot o' 'em lately. Most have been pleasant
exp'riences, and have opened tha joy o' groupin' ta me (I used ta prefer
soloin'). Have only had two bad groups in tha thirty er so dungeons I've
done. :) Over half of tha groups, I'd call excellent.
