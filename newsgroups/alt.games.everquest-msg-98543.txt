I know what you're talking about, and I loved having the quest journal for
the brief period that I played DAoC.  I'd be happy with an in game notebook
sorta thing though, where ya can type notes to read in game, instead of the
game keeping track for me.

 Hehe, I don't like it 'cause I cant type worth a crap, and have to look
down ahlf the time and still get it wrong!  :)

Agreed there too, I'd like a 3rd person following cam that allowed you to
turn AND look up down to the extent that you can in 1st person, with the
mouse.  Another small thing I liked about DAoC.
