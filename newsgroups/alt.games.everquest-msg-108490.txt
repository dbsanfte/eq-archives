Yeah, me too.

It was rather funny though.

I was sitting in the mammoth hide cloak guy's room after killing everything
and was medding up to head out (was hidden with racial hide) and some
assling comes in and says I'm at his camp.  I tell him, uhh, no, you haven't
even been in zone (which is true, when I zoned in no one else was there, and
as I killed the preacher and archaeologist, after each kill I checked /who),
he says, and I quote, "then why these goblins dead".  Whee, Cause I killed
em, dumbass.

Funny thing was, I was level 40 or 41 at the time, and I saw this guys
corpse IN THE ROOM, did a /who...

[44 Druid] Dumbass (Assling) <Some Guild that never does anything important>

/em hugs Bracer of the Hidden;  See Invis rocks for showing morons up for
what they are.  They say they were camping something, and I've been there
for like 15 minutes, with see invis up (and I spam them a bit with the
bracer to prove it).

Hello dumbass, you can't camp something from halfway across the zone.
