Huh. I remember that differently. The Sheriff says, "I'm going to cut his heart
out with a spoon!". To which the sheriff's dimwitted cousin replies, "Why a
spoon, cousin?" "Because it's dull, you twit. It'll hurt more!" I don't even
remember Robin being there for all that. Or are we on two different scenes,
here?
