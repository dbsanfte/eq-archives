Next time you go on a raid, bring a port potion. They are free to Thurg and
maybe 100pp for Halas. Now if I could just find an item (at any price) that
would make my druid very desireable on raids ....

Well, we COULD bounce all over the world. Since Luclin, 25% of the world is
no go, at least by porting. In fact, with the Nexus spires your Rogue's
ability (with Jboots) to move around the world has gotten much closer to the
druids ability. Now where did I put that "make druid useful on raids" item
...

BTW, even rogues CAN be effective soloing class in certain situations. With
poisons, ID, and certainly with the AA abilities. Not that you would want
to. I would guess that you chose Rogue because you wanted to group. I chose
druid because of there ability to port and be secondary healers/buffers.
Over the last year, the druids ability to do either of these has been
SERIOUSLY degraded, of this there is little argument. Melee class
abilities/shortcomings - healing downtime, mobility, damage output, binding,
etc. have all been vastly improved.

hehe - We get Tash. A Journeyman Walking Stick. We all know how people love
meleeing druids though. As far as being desired in raid situations, well
yes. I go on raids all the time because I have many friends in the game and
a great guild. I would like to contribute more to the raid because that
would be more fun. While the petition asks for better heals - I'd prefer
stackable group buff spells. Not to make druids "killing machines" - that is
your job - just to be a benefit to raids.

Well, its not exactly a gate, but I'll give you a stack of port potions for
30 AA points!
