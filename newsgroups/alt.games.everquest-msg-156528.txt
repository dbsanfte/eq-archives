I agree.  I expect that things will loosen up a bit in zones that harbor
characters in their 30's and 40's, and the 60 crowd collectively sets their
alts aside and pulls all those dusty mains back out.

I'm interested to see what happens in the 50's zones ... will they become
abandoned as well, or will they population there skyrocket as folks grind
their way to 60 ASAP?  Hmmmm .....
