The GF4 MX is basically a very mildly souped up GF2.  A decent GF3 is 
better, the GF4 ti-4x00 are far superior, most of the FX series are far 
superior as well.  ATI has several models that are quite a bit better as 
well.

The best GF4 MX is inferior to the GeForce 2 Ultra and to the entire GF3 
and the rest of the GF4 line.  It is better than a GF2 MX, but for a 
similar price, you can get a decent GF3, which outperforms it.

For about $100 you can get a GF4 ti-4200 with 128MB of DDR, and it has 
close to twice the performance of the best GF4 MX which goes for the same 
price.  For around $50 you can get an ATI Radeon 9000 Pro which has about 
half again the performance of the bet GF4 MX.
