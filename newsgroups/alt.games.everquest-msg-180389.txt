First of all this is not Spam , Second of all this is an announcement,
third im not Nick.

and to finish, this is a newsgroup, if im a everquest lover and i feel like
posting a message, regardless of the subject is related or not to everquest
its my own rights.

Just like its your own rights to read what you want in newsgroup.

So Dude, you know where to shove your Spam Treat?

Or you need me to give you some Q's?

My ISP is gonna laugh in your face dumb ass.

Go look what SPAM means, and stop playing to much of that game. it affects
your brain.
