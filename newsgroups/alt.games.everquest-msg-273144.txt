Ahem, uh, actually plenty do care. Speak for yourself. Why are you
trying to turn this into some kind of WoW vs. EQ2 flamewar? That is not
even close to what this thread is about. Nobody is trying to talk up
anything. Perhaps you're just a bit overly sensitive to it. 

Here's a newsflash to many of you. Usenet, and a.g.e. and c.s.i.p.g.r in
particular, are useful for much more than flamewars and other various
forms of hating. You've just witnessed one other such use - anecdotal
exchange. How about we see if we can just take it for what it is as
opposed to making it one more excuse to spread grief.

Am I supposed to be impressed? I play WoW also. Does that make me numero
uno over you, because the subscription base of the games I play
therefore comes to about 850,000? 1,250,000, if you count EQ1. Wait, how
many in SWG...? 

OMFG, I'm s0 l33t!!!1!!1!!one!!!
