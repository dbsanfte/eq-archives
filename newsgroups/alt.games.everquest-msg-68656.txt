    Catchy title, no?  If only it were true.
I can play it well enough, though I do go
link dead often, which is a pain in the ass, 
but I have it better than my husband.
     When he logs on to the game, he can
only sometimes make it to the character
select screen.  Sometimes before, his modem
stops working.  He describes it as "having
zero bandwidth" whatever that means.  The
dial-up says he's still connected, but he
can't do anything with modem.  It
drops him to the logon screen in Everquest,
but he can't connect because of the dead
modem.  When he hits the "exit" button to
go back to desktop, the modem still is 
dead, and he can't use an internet browser.
In order to use the browser again, he has 
to log off the dial-up, and log back on.
He doesn't need to restart the computer.
Also, he gets the same result with AOL 
or Earthlink. 
  He has directx8.1, has downloaded the 
fix from Verant sent to him.  He has 
managed to download 800 megs of patches
without getting disconnected.  He also
completely reloaded his machine.  And
he does have the newest drivers he needs,
supplied by the form letter Verant sent
him.  When not using EQ, his modem works
fine.
    Any thoughts on how we might fix this?
Since we live in different states I only
get to "see" him on EQ, and I miss him!
I appreciate any insights any of you might
have.
