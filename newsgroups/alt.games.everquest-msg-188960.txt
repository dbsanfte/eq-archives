If your mobo is made within the past year:

Check the capacitors on your mobo for brown crust.
There was a batch of mobos that used defective capacitors
that leak over time.  Major brands such as Asus were
among the board makers who used these caps.

Anyway, I had a friend who had a board made with these
leaking caps and he would mysteriously reboot from time
to time.  Also, if you read the various hardware message
boards, many people who have the bad-cap-boards have
reboot problems also.
