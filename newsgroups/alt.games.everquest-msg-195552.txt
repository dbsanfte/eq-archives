Problem is, it's not *meant* to be faster. The downtime is *meant* to be 
there. KEI is a high level buff that is being abused, plain and simple. The 
only reason it hasn't received the nerf bat is that it would upset the 
instant gratification, intestinal fortitude lacking crowd which, 
unfortunately, seems to be getting larger all the time.

Result: the game is forever changed - for the worse.
