Did you not solo much?  Mine was around 120 or so in the low 30's, all from
getting beat on when Bonds of Force was resisted (29+) or when root broke
during nuking (before 29).  It stopped going up as fast when I got jboots,
but still has went up sometimes on the occasional mistake when setting up
quads.
