All the access points to dungeons are located in the original EQ world.
I.E. North Ro/Oasis, Rathe Mountains/South Karana, Mismoore, Permafrost.
There are "adventure givers" in north ro that send you to a nearby dungeon
entry point with an objective.  Its either single party or raid situation.
You enter the dungeon by clicking on it or walking over it (depending on the
loc).  And i think there are a set number of dungeons in each area that can
be entered but that its a number they don't expect to be reached.  I never
experienced not being able to get into a dungeon and I stuck with the North
Ro quest area and it was always crowded.
