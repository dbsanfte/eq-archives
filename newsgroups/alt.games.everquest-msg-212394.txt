You've never seen my four year old dance.  He'll fall.  He falls half of the
time he dances wearing tennis shoes on a carpeted floor.  He just really
gets into it.

I don't know with certainty, no.  There is an outside chance that he'll
listen to me.

There's also an outside chance that the sun will rise in the west tomorrow
morning, but I somehow doubt it.

I personally don't believe in predestiny.  To me, the concept of predestiny
creates all kinds of logical problems.  I agree with what you appear to be
saying ... predestiny precludes free will.  Let me know if I've
misunderstood your statement.  I hate putting words in other folk's mouths.

But again ... if someone believes in predestiny, it's not my place to try to
force them to abandon that belief.  All I can do is lay out my belief
against the concept in as logical of a discussion as I can, and let the
other person decide for themselves.

Who knows?  They may even convince me I'm wrong.
