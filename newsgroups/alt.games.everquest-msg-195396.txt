Well then, Caster's Realm is wrong (big surprise there).
I don't know the numbers for all classes, but for those I do...

Offense and Defense level caps are:
5 * (Level+1) for Warriors
5 * Level for other melees (except Monks, ask a Monk, they may differ)
5 * Level for WIS casters
Hard cap for Defense for Cleric and Druid appears to be 175, Offense
hard cap is higher.  Not sure if Shaman is same.  Hard caps for melees
vary quite a bit, and go up post-50.

Weapon skill level caps are:
5 * (Level + 1) for melees (again, not sure about Monks)
4 * (Level + 1) for WIS casters
