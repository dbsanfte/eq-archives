Yeah, I only got up to banded range, 145ish.  I've gotten a few skill
increases on the very few sets of banded I have made to order.  I have made
some for guildmates for some quests as well, but I haven't played with it
much for a while.  Given that I can now make SoW potions at a profit, I just
haven't seen much reason to play with smithing.
