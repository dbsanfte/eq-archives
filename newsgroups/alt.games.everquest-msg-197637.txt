Getting casting skills behind is *NOT* a problem.  Casters can always
chain cast on themselves or corpses to get their casting skills back
in shape.

The first issue Stormguide raised, though, is a valid one.  If you
don't learn how to play your character, you'll probably end up getting
you and your group (or raid) killed a lot.  Plus you will be
frustrated.  Losing xp at low levels due to death is a lot easier to
regain than at high levels.  Three or four kills at low levels will
restore the xp you lost.  At high levels it may take 30 dark blue
kills.

The game is more fun if you learn the various tactics on your own, by
reading, talking with other, and experimenting.  You'll be able to
solo effectively (yes, even low level wizards can solo well - WITHOUT
KEI), and you'll be a good addition to groups.  Not to mention making
friends of similar level and experience along the way.

The ride to the higher levels is more important than getting there,
IMO.
