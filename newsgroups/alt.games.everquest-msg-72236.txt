You have no idea. They run another service at http://www.mythic-realms.com
which has a long list of games that they have made in the past. As soon as
DAoC was announced and Mythic began working on it, updates ceased for all
those games that people are still paying for. Even on the message boards
MONTHS before DAoC came out, the Mythic presence there was cut by a HUGE
margin and customers started using the "well, they must be working on DAoC"
excuse.
