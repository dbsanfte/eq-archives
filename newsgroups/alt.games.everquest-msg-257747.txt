I don't like this - if you have no downtime to regain what you spent,
then it doesn't matter how poorly you do as long as you don't die.
That seems bad to me - the only punishment is death, so you can't
screw up just a little and have to pay for it.

I'm not convinced a little downtime is such a bad thing.
