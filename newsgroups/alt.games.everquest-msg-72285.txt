Presuming that Windows ME is about the same as Win98:

1.  Right-click on your "My Computer" icon on your desktop.
Select "Properties" from the menu that pops up.  It'll
tell you there how much memory your system thinks it has.

2.  Go to Start/Programs/Accessories/System Tools/System Information
The opening screen of that utility will also tell you how much
memory your system thinks it has.
