And before they did not need to rely on an Int caster for anything, while
Int caster were dependant for years on Wis casters for the utility spells
(ports, SoW, SoE, AC and HP buffs, etc.).  A little turn about does not
hurt.  Just as with the utilies, there are other ways to get what you want,
but it may be easier to get an Int caster to research a spell than to wait
for the drop.

I have a Cleric, Shaman, Necro and Enchanter and don't see a problem in any
of this.  Where's the contention?  That you may need to (gasp) interract
with another player (Heaven Forbid interracting with someone in an MMORPG).
