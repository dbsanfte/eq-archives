Probably never.

However, the idea is to get a PBAE group together.  Chanter isn't 
mezzing, he's AE stunning, so you aren't breaking mez.

The problem with such groups is that they only really employ a very 
limited set of classes; chanter (required, better to get two), wizard 
(best, get up to 5) Druid (decent), Mage (Decent), Cleric (so so, but 
one is nice).

You can put a Puller in that mix as usually 3 PBAE casters are 
sufficient... but the puller isn't really doing any damage to speak of.

So the dream here would be for melee classes to be able to contribute as 
well, via an AA thats useless in most conditions but ideal when you have 
70 stunned mobs standing next to you.

I didn't know that it was one shot and on a long timer, though,  this 
makes it not even suitable for this one limited special function.
