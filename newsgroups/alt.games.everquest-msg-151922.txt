this has the list of supported sound cards. It blew me away when they say
that they have only tested many of them under windows 98, yet they are
selling a game whose ram requirements exceed the capability (512 meg ram) of
that operating system. I have problems with the game crashing (and certain
textures not showing since the last patch), and they say it's because of my
sound card. Hmmm. Does this mean i need a Diamond Multimedia Monster Sound
MX300 before they will take me seriously? Or that they want me to use w98,
despite the fact that my other machine uses xp, geforce etc and has no
stability or graphics issues?

Note: I've reformatted and have latest drivers for everything and done
complete file checks.


Below is a transcript of the dialog i had with them. Note, a while back, i
did try with my sound card disabled just in case. I'm really unimpressed
with their tech support. Does anyone know of a program that can test to see
if there are problems with my geforce? I don't understand why i don't have
problems playing morrowind ... surely that's more demanding than eq?

Hello john,

Unfortunately EverQuest does not currently support your sound card. The
below links will provide you with information about hardware that is
compatible with EverQuest. You may need to replace your incompatible
hardware with hardware that is supported in order to play EverQuest.

I had hoped that between this and the new patches I would have more
stability. Instead, I have less, and seem to have lost certain textures;
eg
skeletons have black feet and wolves/pets look like they have been
flayed.

I have run a thorough file check.

When my eq crashes, sometimes I can relog very quickly but sometimes I
am
locked out for 10 minutes. I don't if that is relevant.

Are there any programs or anything out there which might help aid
diagnostics? It is very frustrating that I have 2 accounts but can only
play
one safely at a time.

Thanks for your time,

john doe.

Hello,

Thank you for contacting the Sony Online Entertainment Customer Service
department.

After looking at the information you have sent me, I have determined
that you EverQuest problem may be a result of the VIA Tech chipsets used
on your motherboard. You will want to download and upgrade the
4-N-1 drivers for your VIA Tech chipset. You can find the drivers you
are looking for at the below location.

VIA Tech Drivers:
<http://www.viaarena.com>

If you are experiencing any problems after you have made these changes;
Please email UPDATED copies of your dxdiag.txt, dbg.txt and MSinfo.txt

1. Run DXDIAG.EXE from your Start menu (click start, run, then type
dxdiag.exe)
2. Click the "Save all Information" button at the bottom of the program
window.
3. Save the file as dxdiag.txt
4. Click on the "More Help" tab
5. Click on the button marked "MSinfo..."
6. Click on the "File" menu and choose "Export"
7. Save the file as a Text Document and name the file "MSinfo.txt"

You can obtain your dbg.txt file from your EverQuest directory (usually
c:/program files/everquest).

Once you have all 3 files, reply to this e-mail and attach the files.

Sony Station - EverQuest Technical Request

I get random crashes in everquest. These seem to occur most predicatbly
when changing between characters, but are dangerously frequent when
hunting, in old world zones or new, with models disabled or enabled.
I'll be playing everquest and then i'll be at the desktop, and then I'll
be on a corpse run.

Note: i play morrowind and other 3d games, which are quite demanding,
and don't experience these crashes, and if i have the game on but am
just sitting, it is relatively more stable, but still crashes..

for example, i can log on in the bazaar and stare at my feet, and look
in at the pc the next day and still be there sometimes.

I have formatted my computer, made sure i have the latest drivers for
all devices, and very puzzled why this is happening. I will try playing
with sound card disabled, but would appreciate more advice, since i
don't see why morrowind wouldn't crash if there were hardware conflicts,
as it is if anything, more demanding than eq (although it doesn't use a
nic? ).

My other pc has the same arrangement of irq's although it does use a usb
nic. I will try another nic if it helps.

I notice that windows xp seems to take away the option to reassign
irq's.
