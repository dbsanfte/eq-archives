I just checked Kaev's gear, and it appears that the Froggies have
the same deal as Half Elves, or at minimum 3/4s of it.  Kaev wears
pieces of Brellium (non-imbued Dwarven), Full Mithril (non-imbued
High Elven), Fine Heraldic (non-imbued Human), and Luminant
Heraldic (Mith. Marr imbued Human) Plate, all of which list FRG
as an allowed race (sorry, ain't got no DE Plate so I can't check
that one).

Looks like Monual just got himself a big new market, hope he's
laid up a supply of imbued diamonds.  :)

Kaev <--- who probably won't be able to resist the temptation to
retire in favor of his (still hypothetical) Frogluk squire
