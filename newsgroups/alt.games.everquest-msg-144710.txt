The hunting grounds that got me to 53 are greening out.  I did 52 in Eastern
Wastes (ulthork men of war, rhinos, and the occasional still-blue walrus or
giant), Emerald Jungle, and would pop into Cobalt Scar now and then to kill
the odd Wyvern or two (almost never could get a multikite, because of
crowds).

At 53, it's going slow in those areas, so I'm looking for somewhere new.
Here are the requirements:

1. I've only got time for casual play right now, so I don't want some place
where I have to wait a long time to get a camp or area, and then need to
hold onto it for hours to make it worthwhile.

2. I sneak in play time while working at home on the other computer.  The
computers share a monitor via a switch, so I need a place where when I can
hide in safety while I med.  Generally, that means it should be easy to find
a non-indifferent mob whenever I want (doesn't have to be high enough to
give XP) so I can make sure hide worked, and there should be no undead that
wander near where I med.

3. It's unlikely I'll get a res if I die, so I'd rather have an area where
the XP isn't as fast, if it means I won't be dying.

Doing EW, EJ, CS at 53 is giving me about a yellow per three evenings of
play, which isn't too bad, actually, since I'm working or watching TV or
reading usenet during that time, but I would like something a little faster.

Anyone have any suggestions for a 53 Wizard?
