Yep, should work just fine.  I actually prefer to "2-box on 1 box".
Setup both sessions windowed and just alt-tab back and forth.

Helps a bit if you have a second drive and can put a copy of EQ on
each drive, but that's not mandatory.  I do that, then I can "de-tune"
the secondary character a bit.  Old graphics, no sound or emotes, etc
but still have all the bells and whistles on for my main char.
