Wow... is that what text books in the US say?

The constition of post-war japan was *imposed* on them by the US during 
the US occupation of Japan. 

/quote:
Under the banner of =3Fdemilitarisation=3F, US occupation personnel wrote 
the =3Fenlightened=3F Japanese constitution of 1946, which contains the 
famous peace paragraph (paragraph nine) renouncing "war as a sovereign 
right of the nation" and stating that "land, sea, and air forces... will 
never be maintained".
