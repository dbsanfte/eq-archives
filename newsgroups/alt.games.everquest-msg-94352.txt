There is Cabilis as a possibility, as a rogue, you can sneak/hide your way
in, no guards right inside the zone, just be careful on the LoIO side, I
think some of the nastys there might see through your sneak/hide, not sure.
You could do something similar in FV too, there are areas, such as on the
shore near the dock that are relatively safe from wandering NPCs that would
take exception to your presence.
