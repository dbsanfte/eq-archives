I'll occasionally be watching a customer at work (I'm a grocery cashier) try
to pick a register through which to bring their cart full of groceries, and
I'll think "oh God, please don't let them agro on me..."  If I ever come
back from a break and see a ton of customers lined up at another register,
my first thought is "man, the other cashier musta trained half the freaking
zone"... :)
