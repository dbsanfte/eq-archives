EQ2 has somewhat different users than I experienced on EQL.

Since much of EQ2 is easy to use straight out of the box, more kids are on 
EQ2, kids who prolly dont know the word usenet.

Besides seeing the activity on clans, a lot of people (which is not 
directed at EQ2 only) are ofte switching from one mmorpg to another at the 
moment. Many tries out WoW and now Guildwars, Matrix Online etc.
