It's clear from my log that the Cleric in question cast the spell.
If there's a bug here then it would be the her client telling her
she had Epitaph of Life mem'd when the spell the game engine had
in that slot was Dread of Night.  If I were convinced of this I
would, of course, apologize to her and the rest of the group, as
failing to realize she was bugged would be a far different thing
than the apparent cluelessness I saw at the time.
