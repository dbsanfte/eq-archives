That explains all the bodies surrounding the zone-ins, a neat idea that's
been carried over to LDoN adventures and deals with one of the classical
bitches about EQ - CRs. Wonder why they haven't adopted that more
system-wide.

Yeah, I noticed that the mobs we fought after zoning into Justice were all
DB and emminently fightable, although they seemed a lot harder to take down
than DBs in LDoN, for example. I believe these were borderline DB-Whites and
they sure fought like it. If Innovation, Disease and Nightmare are an order
of magnitude harder, I'll wait a while ... ;-)

> The entrance to Justice is virtually always safe.

It's a big courtyard with a gallows and some views into what appear to be
jail cells at floor level. Are there any other entrances in this courtyard
other than the stairway down on the left side of the grayeyard, or other
secrets (or dangers) to be aware of? Or is the jail down the stairs the
primary entry point?

Yeah, that one I learned right away! ;-)

I take it that's an exageration based on how long you think it'll take you
to get flagged for entrance? Or is there some other reason you think it's
out of reach? I'm beginning to understand why people say that the game
"begins" at 65.

Oh, and one more thing. When I *first* played this game (at initial release)
I recall that there were introduced some Planes. I remember running along a
zone wall one night on our way to (Guk? CT?) and passing an invisible
entrance that had Spectres inside. Rumor had it that this was the entrance
to the Plane of Fear, or was it Hate? I don't recall and we never ventured
inside. I take it there were other Planes before PoP. What rules apply to
those? Wouldn't those be accessible to players of my level, given the timing
of their introduction?

Thanks again for any info or other shared accounts. It's easy to see why EQ
leads the pack in MMOGs. There is such a ridiculously rich and apparently
endless supply of content. Whew.
