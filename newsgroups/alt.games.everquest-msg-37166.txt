Oh, forgot to mention something that may be of interest to you.  In the
Warrens this IS the case.  Except for the named kobolds, as long as you
don't sit down in their aggro range you won't aggro them.  Feel free to
explore The Warrens with any of your 40+ characters.  At least in the King
area the aggro seems to be pretty small on the named.  I haven't gotten
around to wandering the other half.

So, who knows, maybe Verant HAS learned.  Nah, must be a fluke. :p
