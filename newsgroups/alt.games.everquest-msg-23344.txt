"I swung and missed.  I swung and missed again.  Then, just for good
measure,
I swung and missed a third and fourth time."  --  I couldn't help but laugh
as I read
this.  You sound like Douglas Adams, you should be writing....

"At that precise moment I was stun-spun.  Heedless of this and still
convinced I knew the way, I corrected course (I thought) and ran on,
ignoring the fact that the terrain I was seeing wasn't what it should have
been.  I had to make it to the guards, I had no time for trifles like
landmarks."  ---  It's at times like those to just crouch down into a small
ball and await
the inevitable, or (inserting useful advice):  if you are a class that has
Gate,
the prime time to Gate if you can get it off while getting whacked.  I hope
you were able to retrieve your corpse without too much difficulty.

Believe me, I've been there, and the Orc Shamans can be nasty and getting
lost in Everfrost trying to find those guards isn't fun either.
Exciting though...  ; )
