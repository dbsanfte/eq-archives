Im still an Everquest "newbie" myself I suppose. Level 11 Ranger, limited
travel and all that :)

This new upcoming feature of level 1-10 characters auto-ressurecting with
all their gear at their bind point...sounds nice, but I think there is a
problem here.

It completely takes away the risk and excitement in the early days. After
reaching level 11, I look back on all my close calls, near-death, masterful
cowardly run-aways (:). I feel a sense of achievment that I survived some
VERY close shaves. Runs through less known areas were truly nerve wracking.
All this as highly enjoyable.

Thats all going to go now. Ive played Diablo and it too has a "resurrect
with your all you gear feature" Death will mean nothing. No more excitement
from entering a new dungeon (from a newbies point of view), just oh well if
I die..who cares. And all through the levels 1-10, thats a long time to not
care abot dieing. There will not be the same sense of satisfaction when
reaching past the newbie season.

I think Verant might be making a mistake here.

Pete
