I agree, but it's very situational stuff, and without a cleric, warriors
are a liability rather than a valuable addition. By the time a warrior
brings an added benefit to a group/raid, clerics are already
irreplaceable. Clerics have been given a lot or new abilities to free
them from the war/cleric foundation, which leaves warriors there alone.

I love AETaunt, but it's just another prosthetic. A warrior withough
AETaunt is compltely and utterly useless in a rotation. No other class
has such insurmountable barriers to participation.

There's very little difference in similarly equipped classes, due to
almost ALL the post wToV armor options being multiclass. Raising the AC
cap would help warriors, just as much as other classes. It'd do nothing
much for the 'relative' balance.

>fixing taunt (make it 20% better for warriors?).. 

This is gonna sound completely stupid, but more taunt isn't what will
fix the warrior caste. Making the taunt button for cumulative taunt
rather than just 'top of hate list +1 taunt' would be a start. If you
increase taunt, you make more encounters (particularly at the high end)
too trivial. Rogues, wizards and other agro-by-damage classes have
absolutely zero excuse for getting killed by poor agro management.

>versus a monk though?  sorry, /veto

The oft quoted 1.0/1.2/1.4 melee class dps ratios went out of the window
ages ago, and are only going to get worse. There are only 3 weapons in
the game a warrior can use on a high end raid. BoC, Hategiver and
Bloodfrenzy, none of which have damage procs. Giving them a semi-
resistable 100-150dd component might be a start. I don't want monk level
DPS, just the ballpark ratio outlined above.


Well, what *DD* you want, Mr. Hard-to-please? Huh?

Well, now that you asked...<grin>

I want to see a return to cloth/leather/chain/plate class restrictions
actually meaning something. Leather should have the avoidance, but when
they're hit, they're hit HARD. Plate should be hit more often, but with
more mitigation. Whether they do this with innate mitigation modifiers
for classes (or separate class damage tables) or with innate mitigation
on armor types, I don't know.

What I *don't* want to see (but fully expect to) is item specific
melee/defensive focus effects. This would reduce any remaining semblance
of 'choice' warriors have.

What you have to remember is the curve we are on, and why it is so
worrying for warriors. All classes can now get +125hp items. A rogue
actually has access to 28hp more raw +hp than a warrior for example.
With 127 being the hardcoded cap, this means an increase in hp
differential through raw +hp on items is impossible. Stam is 255 capped
on all melees and a lot of casters in the high end arena, initially with
buffs, and now 255 unbuffed. Impossible to increase hp differential
through stam. Existing rightclicks to artificially increase hps (eg: Emp
torque, cursed BPs, sham potion) are all multiclass. AAs are all
multiclass.

All this leads to the current HP differential between warriors and other
classes remaining stable at it's current margin, (ie: too small), and as
people max out on 125hp items, the numbers will increase, but the gap
stay the same. Combine that with avoidance skills, and there'll be very
little difference between a 8khp monk and a 8.5k hp warrior

Although the 'tanking' differences are capped, the DPS difference
continue to diverge. Weapons keep getting better ratios, +ATK is
limitless, and the DPS difference just keep getting more and more
pronounced. Countless classes will be able to do a warrior's job in all
but cler/war dependant situations, including most exp situations, whilst
putting out considerably more dps. There will be simply zero use for a
second warrior in any group.

I want to be able to tank, without question of being the best at it. For
that I'll take a large cut in DPS, but not so much that I'm ineffective
for melee.
