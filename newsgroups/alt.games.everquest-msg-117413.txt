    Necros get some of the cleric PBAoE spells early on, the Word line. No,
that would be a spectacular failure with quadding. :-/

    Three choices: one, solo side by side. Both of you are killing machines,
with very distinct styles, and should play to your strengths. Problem:
you'll feel like you aren't playing together. Here's my second idea:

    Tarre goes out and pulls four, one by one, with her biggest Darkness
line spell. After she pulls each one, TFlux them off her and start kiting
them around. Once you have a quad going, start doing your thing. Every so
often run close to Tarre, and she can twitch you. If you end up with one or
two mobs left let Tarre mop them up. If you find Tarre's Darkness spell
isn't lasting long enough, try having her pull with her best Scent (to help
you with resists) and do the same thing, casting Bonds once you have your
four rounded up.

    And here's my third idea: play to Tarre's strengths. You pull stuff to
her and root it. She dots them, and the two of you rot stuff. You keep the
pulls coming and the roots holding. If something has some life left after
DoTs wear off, either send in Jabober or you burn it out. If you have some
druids that multikite with their leafblower ask them how they handle the
multiples. You should be able to manage a solid stream of kills this way.
