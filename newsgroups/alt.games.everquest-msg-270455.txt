Can anyone tell me basically what has happened to the first EQ since EQ2 
came out?  Is it dead or at least hurting?
How is EQ2?  Just wondering...I won't play either anymore, as MMORPG's are 
far too time consuming for my life.  However, I just dropped in to see how 
EQ is doing in general with the newly added EQ2.

Take care all.
