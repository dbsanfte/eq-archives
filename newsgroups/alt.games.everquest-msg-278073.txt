I do generally spend about what I make, as my bank balance stays fairly 
consistant.  I see no reason to allow it to accumulate and get higher, 
except when I am specifically saving up for something.

When I was low level, that was an issue, I had to pick and choose which 
spells I would actually buy as I could not afford all of them.  I found 
this to be particularly true as an Enchanter with the number of spells 
they get.  At higher levels, in the case of spells like the DoN ones, I 
got them as drops on raids and/or in groups, and bought one or two 
myself.  My guild also bought a lot of the tradable runes for guild 
members.

Except that like probably a majority of the people who play, I am 
clueless as to bazaar prices, so I wouldn't know a bargain like that 
anyway.  I have zero interest in playing the bazaar market, I get what I 
want when I can afford it, and do without when I can't.

I agree, and I don't generally spend down to my last bit of cash, 
although while I was actively learning tradeskills, I did just that 
several times.

Being a shaman, I have no reagents that I need to keep on hand, and I can 
count on one hand the number of times I have needed a corpse summonned 
that was not on a guild raid (where the guild picks up the coffin).  I do 
actually generally keep a coffin or two on hand, as well as an essence 
emerald or two, just in case.
