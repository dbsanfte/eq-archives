The damage isnt the same...

Taking 55% less damage every hit means 10 swings for 1000 will, instead of
10k damage, do5.5k damage
Avoiding 50% of blows means 10 swings for 1000, again instead of 10k damage,
will do 5k damage

Change the numbers and you will see different results... parse it in
reality, and again you will see different results in different scenarios.

Depends on the mob for the strat.. cleric reverse DS is the best, but
clerics are typically tied up on a heal chain, or have problems landing
it... dispell has no resist check
