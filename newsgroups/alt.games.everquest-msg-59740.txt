I dont know about your server but on MT BABS are easy to find.  People
are always auctioning them and they have singlehandedly trashed the
market on 2HS weapons due to people wanting to just get rid of them so
they can loot another.   I dont know your definition of "poor" but on
MT it isnt uncommon to see them for 200 to 300.

You dont mention what your axe that "hits for 60" is, but when dual
wielding you want speed.  Trading a bit of speed for a little more
delay is not necessarily bad, perhaps using an Icetooth Claw (around
200 on MT 11/29 Primary Only) with the Pitchakta.  

As I said, without knowing what "poor" means to you it is a little
harder to judge (although you may have defined it in a later post I
havent accessed yet=)
