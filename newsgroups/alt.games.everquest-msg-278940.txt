Just a note, not once did I say I wanted to see more of the scaling.  I
said it was really nice.  I like having the area accessable to both my
50 and my 28, and it still be challenging for both.

I think having full outdoor zones that scale would suck.  That would
ruin a lot for me.  I don't think it is bad with a dungeon that scales.
 I definately wouldn't want to see it overdone though.
