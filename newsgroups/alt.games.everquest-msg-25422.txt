It's not too hard to get an Iksar off Kunark (I take the OT boat).
You can use the vendors in the EC tunnel, and probably lots of other
vendors too.

I finally got so I could bank in Freeport.  I killed Sergeant Slate
in EC maybe a couple dozen times.  You can get the same faction 
killing Guards Tolus and Reskin, and they're only level 25.

I can pretty much go to any "adventure" zone I want, just have to be
careful to avoid guards.
