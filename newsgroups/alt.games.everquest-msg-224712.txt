They nerfed pottery some time back, made the skillups a lot rarer than 
they were, at the same time they made tailoring easier.  They changed a 
few others as well, don't recall which ones off hand.  Many of those 
guides were written prior to that change.  SoE also changed a lot of 
sellback prices on items that are made via tradeskills so that not only 
do you not profit from them, but you take a huge loss on them.  This also 
affects the cost to skillup.
