While this does seem like a sign of the apocalypse, rest assured, its an 
improper explaination.

Moving to a safe location wasn't necessary in this case, as they did a 
roll back to your last save... SO if you were busy fighting something 
when the server came down, no worries, whatever you were doing was going 
to be wiped; what you need is a safe spot to come -back- to, not a safe 
spot to be in at the moment... but it doesn't really matter where you 
are right now, the question is, where were you on your last save?  If 
-that- might be a bad spot, best thing to do is go zone, and not into a 
"hot landing" area.  There are other ways to force a save but I've never 
found them as reliable as people say.

BUT its also good to note that since there's a roll back, you need to 
think about whether you are better off or worse off since your last 
save; if you've just had your butt handed to you in a sling, and you're 
low on mana and low on hp, go ahead and log out.  If on the other hand 
you're a bard who just swarm kited 20 mobs in Dulak for the first time 
ever, you should probably go zone to force a save.

Odds of SOE ever going into that much detail are low, but the summary 
they did post isn't just skipping detail, its actually wrong!

For example, I died, got a rez, got healed up and buffed up, then logged 
out for a dinner break shortly before the patch announcements started. 
Cursed a bit when I saw this thread, because I knew what would probably 
happen.  Sure enough, when I logged back in I was utterly unbuffed, with 
rez effects back on, though fully healed and geared; my last save 
happened when I looted my body.
