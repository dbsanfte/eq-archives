If you're referring to the two groups that kidnap Merry and Pippin they are
both orcs, just one is a group of orcs from Sauron and the other are the
Uruk-Hai from Saruman.  The arguments that ensue are because the Sauron
group of course wants to take the halflings east to Barad-Dur and the
Saruman to Orthanc.  Of course you could be referring to the orcs that take
Frodo and if so haven't gotten that far in the book just yet although I have
read it many times before and seem to remember "goblin" and "orc" being used
interchangeably.  Where I got this information for this post though was from
Robert Foster's Guide to Middle-Earth.  One of the best dictionaries out
there on Tolkiens books.  I've also read The Silmarillion and it never
mentions a race of Goblins as separate from the Orcs.
