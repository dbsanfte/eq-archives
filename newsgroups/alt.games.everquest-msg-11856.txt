Turgur.

Of course not. That's why nobody in their right mind is suggesting a 
shaman to be the main tank. It's just people that know how to play 
shamans can tank for a short period of time while the real tanks get 
shit off of them

Considering that the mob is swinging at 1/4th of the normal rate, I 
don't think so

I don't think they need it or want it. All they need is to be able to 
survive one resist of Turgur

Since when is "tanking" the same thing as "dealing melee damage"? By 
this rationalle the rogue is the best tank in the game?

At 51 my friend's shaman was tanking low-mid blues (Ice giants in 
Everfrost) for 2 minutes while his DoTs cooked. That enough?

> You use the word "good", as if they *could* make a primary tank,

Oh no. Let me rephrase it -- "fuck no"! The fact that in a specific 
situation they can take some heat doesn't mean that they should do it in 
every situation possible
