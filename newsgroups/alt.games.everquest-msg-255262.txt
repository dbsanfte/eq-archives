I ran a 56k dialup for a while too.   The game plays fine with single group
activities, well enough that I don't see a performance difference now with
broadband than I did with dialup then.   The only time when it was an issue
was during a 30+ person raid.    Even with serverfilter on and all of the
extra info off, with that many people in that small of an area, I would get
extremely lagged.     Mobs would die and I would still see them standing for
a minute afterwards, since all the damage info hadn't gotten transmitted to
me yet.    More importantly, my own commands would take 10 seconds each to
process through the system.   Which is a very bad thing if you're a tank
fighting mobs that enrage.     Even turning off attack at 20% on the mob, I
sometimes wouldn't stop swinging until enrage had already killed me.

Thats probably not an issue for the original poster though.   Raiding for
the most part is a level 65 activity.  Most places you couldn't even try
raiding until 55 due to zone level limits.  And for a true newbie, level 65
is months if not years away.
