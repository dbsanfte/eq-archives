Don't I wish. Bristlebane is first come, first serve, a basic free for all.
Many a guild raid  has been postponed, rescheduled, or scrapped all together
because of another guild or raid being in the zone first. And on large servers
like BB, for the bigger spawns and zones, most guilds just wait until the wee
hours of the morning after a patch, and the spawn/zone goes to the guild with
the most people on or who are already there.
A question for the 3 other servers who are the same size and larger than BB:
How often do you suffer from overcrowding in raid zones? Competition for spawns
seems outragous on BB...same for you?
