Here is another story from several years ago:

http://www.savannahnow.com/stories/082898/CMNinfant.html

It's about an infant who died after her mom went to play video poker
and left the baby locked in the car outside.  I've heard of several
other cases of parents being arrested for leaving their children
locked in their cars at casino parking lots while they went inside to
gamble.  Is the casinos' fault that some people don't have enough
common sense to just stay home and not go to the casino if they can't
find someone to babysit their child? 

(note--the article also said that the woman's husband and father of
the baby afterwards started lobbying to have video poker banned in
South Carolina and claimed he didn't hold his wife responsible because
"she has an addiction" to video gambling)
