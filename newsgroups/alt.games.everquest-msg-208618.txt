Nah, every few months they have another "complete" edition of EQ. They
did it with Velious, Luclin, POP and now LOY. They do it EVERYTIME the
next expansion is announced (in this case Lost Dungeons of Norrath.)
They do it to generate some more retail sales in the lull. The lull is
that period of time between when the sales for the last expansion
(pop/LOY) drop off and before the new expansion (Lost Dungeons) comes
out. 

Sometime after Lost dungeons is out there will be yet another boxed
set which includes all the games. Count on it, it happens evertime. It
will likely come out in the middle period before the NEXT expansion.

Client sales are a measure of success, mainly industry success.
Without client sales it is difficult for other members of the industry
to perceive how successful you are, since client sales are tracked by
third parties. So Lucasarts goes shopping for an MMORPG maker to do
Star Wars Galaxies and they go with SOE. Would they go with SOE if SOE
only said they had many downloaders of software? I doubt it. Retail
sales is a measure of success.

This is why software won't be free. It won't be free because it is too
hard to measure "free" stuff. How many desktops is Linux on? You'd
have no idea since it is free as well as there being several different
vendors/types of "linux." You could check how many retail copies of
SuSE or Redhat have been sold, but this information would do nothing
more than tell you how many retail copies of SuSE or Redhat have been
sold. Even knowing how many instances of the software have been
downloaded doesn't really tell you how many people are using it, a
majority could have just "tried" it.

A larger reason why most software won't be free is that the people
making it need some kind of a job to make a living like everyone else.
If you are working at a horrible job, while coding "free" software, it
is very likely that you are really stupid or not very good at making
software. If you were good at making software, someone would offer you
a job to come and make it with them so you'd be paid to do what you
want to do full time. In almost every case of people really adding to
"free" software projects, like linux or such, they are eventually
snatched up and doing at least something similar for a company. People
being paid to help make the stuff means that the stuff won't be free.

SuSE and Redhat and some other 'nixes are only downloadable for "free"
because enough people pay for them in some form or another to let the
companies still make money.

Really MMorpgs are the last pieces of software which can't be pirated
so in a way they are the most successful software. You HAVE to buy a
copy to get your UNIQUE registration code connected to your account
FOREVER. Then you have to continue paying $12.95 or whatever a month
to keep playing. Meanwhile other software is often cracked in some
way, letting people experience it for "free."

30 years ago someone might have said that someday recorded music will
be free.
