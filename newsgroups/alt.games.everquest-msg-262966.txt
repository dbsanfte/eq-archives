There are situational modifiers (position, sitting, low health,
root) that effect who has aggro.  Or are you telling me that a
melee mob will show WizardWithDeathWish_01 in HoTT even as it
continues to beat on Tank_02?  The only time I've noticed
positional mods ignored by mobs is when they cast spells,
they'll often lob a debuff or whatever at some particularly
hated caster and then switch back to the tank.  Otherwise, if
Shaman_01 gets a little ahead of the tank on the hate list
without drawing aggro a successful Taunt by the tank will
help the tank hold agro.  OTOH, if the tank is atop the hate
list that Taunt will be either +1 hate or no effect (we have
no way to tell the difference, regardless it's insignificant).

Not true.  The higher level Paladin has faster casting stuns and
more of them (ALL stuns have added delays) has the channelling skill
to cast in melee and depending on level and content may have stuns
that will stick allowing him to chain at least a couple without
having to channel, generates WAY more hate via melee and procs, has
the tanking stats to survive long enough to generate the hate, and
etc.

Further, SKs can match Paladins for hate.  Highend Warriors are
better than either Knight class over extended periods of time (but
not for reliable FAST aggro).  Real casters, Wizards, Shaman, and
Necros in particular, can outaggro any melee including hybrids.

The only reason people think that Paladins are the masters of aggro
is because any moron (and most housecats) can use a hotkey macro to
chain cast stuns and thereby hold aggro from a single mob until they
are killed for their stupidity or they run out of mana.  No thought
is required in nice safe XP-grind-type situations, and it appears
that none is expended (way too many of the Paladins I meet in-game
are incompetent boobs with a "stubby little index finger"[1] from
mashing the stun hotkey they finally got set up right the 6th time
somebody explained in laborious detail exactly how to do it).
