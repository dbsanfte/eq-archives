Given that practice points are generally useless, and that research doesn't hit
a cap at which the trainer won't train you, I don't think I'll ever try to
research a spell with less than the maximum research skill for my level.

Therefore, the research practice thing is useless.. the more so since I happen
to know its as large a PITA as research in general, only you don't even end up
with usuable or salable spells.

It was indeed the re-researching thing I was whining about, though, the rest of
it is a nuisance but par for the course, the idea of redoing my level 24s to
get my 29s, and then redoing 24 and 29s to get 34s, and so forth, well, that
seems like insult added to injury.

At any rate, I hit level 26, remaxed my research skill, and now have all four
pets... over 100pp in materials later, that is.  Oh and I had a leftover so I
bought another spell scroll and tried it hoping to recoup my losses, no joy,
failed that combine!
