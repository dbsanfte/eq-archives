Fine. Then the tank either: A) goes out and buys his peridots or B)
Pays you for the peridot every time you symbol him. I've heard of
_VERY_ few cases where a cleric has been kicked out of/refused a group
for attempting to recoup lost money for spell components. It's totally
unreasonable to expect any group member to freely throw plat at the
group, especially a "pick-up" group.
