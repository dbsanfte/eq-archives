How come i can only buff ( i know ranger spells are weak!) others with feet
like cat, and not all the other spells i have? im level 21 at the moment so
that only leaves skin like wood/thistle coat. why cant i group buff, or even
just drive by people with these.

i looked on quides and such like and it says that only glimpse is 'self
only'

thoughts idea's always welcome

thanks, lotusman
