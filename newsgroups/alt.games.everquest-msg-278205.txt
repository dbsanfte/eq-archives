Geeze, grumpy needs a nap, I'd say. I merely said it would be nice, not 
that it's the direction they should have taken. I can just see where the 
guy was comfing from, as I have always thought the aquisition of all of 
one's new spells was unnecessarily tedius.

Of course it would be silly to alter the process to accommodate such a 
small percentage of the items sold. Um...duhr.

Oh, and as far as living with grief goes, how's that workin' out for *you*?
