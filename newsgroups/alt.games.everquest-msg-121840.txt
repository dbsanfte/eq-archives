First, Damn.. very nice.  I would take him to a dungeon and learn to play
him.. like guk or seb.  So they you aren't in a raid situation where
everyone depends on you, but you still have the high level stuff that you
need to fight to get used to using the character.  Very interesting.  GM's
do have the power to duplicate characters on the same server.. one dupped my
enchanter the other day to see if he was bugged for a faction thing.. the
name was just changed a little bit.  Someone probably has a station name
similar to yours and they either mistyped theirs in or the person who was
doing the transfer typed in the first couple of letters and yours came up,
so they just chose it (not sure how it works on their side).  If you have
petitioned multiple times, theres nothing much more you can do, the
character is yours now.
