Depending on where you are I would look into a Clone from a local dealer,
you will get more computing power for the buck. Things you will get with a
clone, local support, a computer designed for your needs, a computer that
can be upgraded, an OS that can be reloaded, a 1 year warrantee. Things you
will get with a Dell, Generic Software package, Telephone and mail in
support (some packages may include onsite service), Non-upgradeable system,
a preload software disk that reloads system to day of purchase status (loss
of all data), 3 year warrantee.

P4 1.6g
512-768mb Memory
Windows XP OS
17" display
32-64mb AGP Video (Nivida GForce or ATI Radieon) Card
Sound Card (Sound Blaster Live had probelms not sure if fixed)
Speaker System with Sub-woofer
