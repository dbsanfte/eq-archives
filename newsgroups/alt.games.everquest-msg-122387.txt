14 pieces of resist gear. Fungi tunic. Tolans bracer. AC gear to wear
when tanking. alternative weapons with AC for tanking, with no proc for
when I MUST not get aggro. Gnome skin suit for looking pretty. coupla
hundred arrows for trueshot. Tradeskill items. Food & water.

It fills up pretty quick with situational gear if you let it ;)
