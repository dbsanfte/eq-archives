Lucky you. It's time for you to go earn one of the best items in the game.
Only available to Tunare followers though, and doesn't require a planes
raid to get. It's a long, but not difficult quest (comprised of 3
individual escalating quests to earn the final item)

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1254

Warden Symbol of Tunare
AC: +7 Wis: +3 Cha: +2 Mana: +15 
Inventory Slot: Neck

Effect: Grasping Roots
Type: Triggered
Charges: Unlimited

The only downside to the quests is they all take place (for the meat of
them anyway) in LFay. I absolutely HATE LFay. Equestrielle always seems to
go out of her way to cause problems for me, and her 402p HT is no joke.

I hate that horse.
