Well i am sure there will be pieces here and there that are a little better
then warlords as we are seeing with some NToV drops.  However, the amount of AC
wont matter after a certain point anyway.  Although the Luclin soft cap might
get moved up... after you hit a certain amount (1500-1600 with velious i think,
or maybe 1400) anything more is just extra AC that you could be using to get
other stats up with since you will take the same damage.  I've heard this
explained a ton of times along with damage parsers at different AC's so this
seems to be the way they will go.  I heard about there being epic armor... i
would think a BP would be 80-100 AC possibly if the quest is tough enough.
