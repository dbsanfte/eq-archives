The learning curve is a huge issue.  You MUST learn Linux to do anything in
Linux.  I've yet to come across a gui worth a damn...you must open a
terminal window to do just about anything.

I'm a Linux newbie...I've only spend about 7 days "/played" on the damned
thing.

Linux isn't free when you have to spend a decent chunk of time just learning
the OS, and a decent chunk of change buying books to avoid having to attempt
to navigate the black hole known as online Linux documentation.

In a few years my employer will have to give up a good, strong, robust,
easy-to-use OS (MPE/iX) because HP is dropping support for it in favor of
the POC known as HP-UX...maybe once I'm done being versed in Unix I'll take
another stab at Linux.

As to hardware, RH7.1 runs like shit on a P75 with 96MB RAM.  Maybe other
distros are faster, but as far as I know only RH and Mandrake are made with
new end users in mind.
