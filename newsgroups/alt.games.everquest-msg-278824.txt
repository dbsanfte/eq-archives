Of the three primary pet classes (Beastlord, Magician, and Necromancer) the 
necromancer has the least tankable pet.  Any Noble's Causeway named would 
kill my pet in seconds.  Necromancers have weaker pet heals than the other 
two classes and until the recent revamp in spells it had a 10 second recast 
time.  Keeping a pet alive against a hard htting mob is difficult.  Using a 
pet to tank in an xp garnering situation is really only viable against 
undead mobs where the necromancer can slow.  Generally when soloing, fear 
kiting into the 50s and then aggro kiting is the path to best solo xp for 
time spent.

In the above situation with Noble's Causeway nameds, I got most of my OoW 
spells from Aggressive Murkglider and Ridgerunner Druunt.  I would root, 
snare, 2 dots, get summoned, and then start running and lifetapping between 
summons.  Lifetap will break root, so once root is off then I'd send in pet. 
This is the standard method for soloing summoning mobs that cannot be 
straight tap tanked (i.e. stay in melee range for the duration of fight and 
lifetap as necessary).
