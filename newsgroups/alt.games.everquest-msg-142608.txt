That's a tough one to answer.....

What makes the game "cooler" to you? If by "cooler" you mean new
abilities/spells and the ability to travel to newer and tougher areas,
then yes the game gets "cooler" as you level.

Gaining levels in EQ gives you access to more abilities and spells (if
you are a caster or hybrid). It also gives you the freedom to travel
and explore new areas, and leads to better equipement.

Technically EQ plays the same at level 1 as it does at level 60 (Kill
mobs..gain exp...loot...use/sell gear). If you are bored with that
style of play at lower levels, chances are you will be just as bored
at higher levels. (Unless the abilities/spells make the game for you)

The higher you get in levels the longer it takes to get things done.
Casual players often find themselves stalled at higher levels, because
they do not have enough time to commit to the game in order to
advance.

What do you consider a "REAL quest". If by real you mean with a decent
reward you will generally be disappointed. By the time you complete
most quests the item you receive is not as good as what you are
already using. If you like to do quests, do them for the fun and
challenge. Otherwise you will be disappointed more often than not.
That being said there are some quests that are worth doing, and the
rewards are really nice. You will have to do a little research to see
what quests are best for your class/level, and which ones are worth
doing. (Unless you just like to do quests for the fun of it.)
