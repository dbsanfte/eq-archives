DEAR GOD! Does WoW even NEED apologists? It isn't even LIVE yet!

Please get off your high horse! Once it goes live, plunk down your god
damned money and try it. If it does not float your boat, go somewhere
else.

His statement goes for WoW, EQ, DAoC, SWG, FF11, and any other number
of acronyms you care to name, it also goes for real life too. If it
ain't workin' out, MOVE THE FUCK ON, and get over it. If that
involves, canceling your account, so be it.
