    Are you capable yet of doing a "money shot" like LoS was - a screenshot
with all three Warders' corpses in it? (Of all the guild web sites I've
read, LoS is the one guild that seems to know what fun is and what "uber"
should be.)

    So are the Warders supposed to be down for good once the Sleeper is
awakened? Or just until next server repop? Given a guild capable of killing
the fourth warder, do you think it possible to do, say, the first, second,
and fourth warders on a ST visit? Given that the Warders each seem to have
specific Primal drops, do you foresee certain Warders becoming pretty much
useless to you in the near future (the same way Phara Dar is mostly killed
for the earring and Robe)? EQ minds want to know!
