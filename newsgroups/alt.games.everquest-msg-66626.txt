This is not a flame, but you are still a newbie.  You haven't seen the best
parts of the game.  If you are enjoying it now, wait till you hit your 40s
and 50s... You will have a blast.

my system was hurting at less than 200 megs of ram. i only have a 700mhz
celeron with 32 mg vid card. but im over 300 megs now and everything is
cool.

as i said above, i thought graphics were better.  but the gameplay was not
as good as eq.
i thought daoc was the greatest thing in the world. 3 friends from work
dropped eq and went to daoc.  after 2 weeks i was pretty bored and upset
with the game. i stuck with it for a month though. things just got worse.
of those 3 friends, one is still playing. me and my other friend went back
to eq.  daoc did do a lot of thing eq should have done a long time ago, but
still does not make it the better game.  also, daoc is so new, there is a
whole lot of nerfing going on. i tried 4 different chars and 3 of them were
nerfed to all hell and just plain unplayable anymore.  the thing is, daoc is
trying to make *everyone* happy... so in pvp, if too many ppl complain they
got hit too hard by Class_X, they nerf it. i may go back and check it out 6
months or longer from now, but till then, my account is canceled.
