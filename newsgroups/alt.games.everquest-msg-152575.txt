Douglas Adams, in one of the hitchiker books, described a dog owned by a
pub owner. (It may have been the dog who ate the invading fleet of alien
spacecraft when he couldn't get a cheese sandwich, but I'm not sure.)

The dog's name was, IIRC, Bonzo the Not So Amazing Non-Wonder Dog.
(Something close to that.)  A dog who's intelligence was such that he
was fired from work on a television dog food commercial when he failed
to choose the correct bowl three times running, even though the
competitor's brand had been liberally doused with motor oil.

My dog eats pieces of wood for no apparent reason. And she's no puppy.
She's coming up on eight or nine years old now.  Also, in the living
room, when you throw a toy for her to go fetch and bring back, it's
about a fifty fifty shot as to whether or not she'll slam her head into
the doorway jam as she spins around to run after it.

And no.. she's not blind. At least not yet. ;-)
