And with batwings you can cast levitate and float over water and the ground
vs summon a kick ass pet that tanks and helps you slaughter everything level
appropriate to you.

All in all, you could take levitate away from my characters that cast it,
bat wings off of vendors, and give me an equivalent summon to what my necro
gets even requiring bone chips for it and I would be kissing ass for the
favor.
