SOE probably has too many users to have its user base grow by leaps and
bounds percentage wise, but I don't agree that your arguments show that it
has plateau'ed or is on a downward slope.

SOE says that the LoY is targeted at levels 35-60, so someone brand new to
the game isn't going to start EQ and immediately get use from LoY zones.
However, it does expand the EQ universe, which is a selling point against
its competition for newcomers to the MMORPG genre.  Further, you could say
that SOE designed LoY with new users in mind by recognizing how quickly
people get past those early levels and how much congestion there is for good
camps at higher levels.  Jane Doe who buys the game in April could easily
have a toon to 35-51 within three months.  If she gets stuck and has limited
places to level, she'll get frustrated, possibly quit, and certainly not
recommend the game to any of her friends.

Regarding PoK and mapping - newcomers to the game will get the same, if not
more, use from these conveniences than existing customers.  I can agree to a
degree about them taking some of the danger and wonder from the game, but I
wouldn't say that they are geared strictly towards existing customers.  I've
never played another MMORPG, but if EQ is the only one making you sit on a
dock for 30 minutes waiting on a boat to hunt a zone, then you have to wait
30 minutes for a boat to get out of that zone later, they better make a
change or potential new customers are going to choose another product.

Also, they added Frogloks, a race available to new and existing players
both.  They weren't necessary, they were put in for fun, and, IMO, to
attract new customers.

I'll say that for most people the leveling process from 1- somewhere between
40 and 51 is *relatively* quick.  Not for everybody, certainly the amount of
time available to play makes a big difference.  People 51+ need a little
room to breath.  EQ isn't an attractive product if people are packed elbow
to elbow in the 51+ camping spots.  Meanwhile, many of the newbie zones are
much less congested than when I first started.  I would argue that there has
never been a better time to start a character and get those first 30-odd
levels out of the way in a relaxed atmosphere.  Beyond that, why would they
start a new server period if the user base had plateau'ed or was in decline?

I agree with the last part of your last sentence.  For me, the lower levels
are a lot more fun than 51+, but I think we are in the minority.  Basically,
most new users want to get to 50+ and do epics, raids, etc. as quickly as
possible.
