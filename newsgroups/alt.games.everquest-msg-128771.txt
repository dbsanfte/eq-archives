Never seen server-wide announcement of a banning. I have seen
zone-wide. Some snert took inspiration from that web page a previous
snert had set up about trying to get himself banned by training specs
all around Oasis and such. Our snert did the same, spewing vulgarities
in shouts and /ooc and bragging about how the GMs hadn't done shit to
him yet. Suddenly, his bragging went quiet as no fewer than 3 GM (Yes,
full GMs) showed up in the zone. About 5 minutes later, a zone-wide
announcement was made thanking everyone who brought the problem to
their attention and that the troublemaker would not be returning to
cause any more problems...

I understand that banning wasn't for the language, just spinning off
on the banning announcement tangent. ;-)
