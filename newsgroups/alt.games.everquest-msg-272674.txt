Likely so, but it's a very small drop compared to the 5-level cliff.  I
stopped levelling at 68.99 to keep the bonus, so I can't say how much it
changes at 69 or 70, but the difference from 65 to 68 on things that are 63 or
higher is unnoticeable for me, while things that are under 63 are simply not
worth killing.

Agreed.  Any penalty you suffer within 5 levels is small enough to be far
outweighed by faster kill rate and lower risk.  The penalty (loss of bonus, if
you prefer, though it's the same effect) at 6 or more levels difference is
the one that matters.
