Just wanted to say thx for all the playing advice.  I am now a lvl 33 Cleric
and loving it.  People love me and say that I play the class very well,
however it always makes me sad when the Wizzy will over nuke and I have to
let him die.  But no biggie as I have rez right?  Most are fairly
understanding and know its their fault, but man some really get pissed.  I
was in a group a couple of days ago in Dawnshroud Peaks, and the MT had
accidentally pulled 3 instead of one.  Well the wizzy starts to chain nuke
the beasties and whammo suddenly he has 3 very pissed tribal hunters on him.
Well needless to say there wasn't much I can do about it.  So he dies off
the MT retakes the aggro and we pull through by the skin on our teeth.  I
was OOM the MT was at 5%, the druid was at 3% and the rog was at 9%.  So
afterwords the Wizzy gets all pissed saying the MT wasn't doing his job
because he didn't pull the aggro off of him fast enough, and that I sucked
because I could heal him fast enough.  (you do the math Lvl 30 Wiz + 3
Tribal Hunters = One VERY dead wizzy.)  Anyways we rez him medd up pull
again, and the Wizzy does it AGAIN.  Anyways so I rez him one more time and
the MT chews him out, he says he will be good from now on.  So we start
again, the MT goes and pulls, we get the MOB to about 20% the wizzy decides
we need another mob, so he goes out and trys to pull one, ends up pulling
about 5 and runs back to the group.  Well we see him coming and all zoned
because we were low anyways, the wizzy dies again.  I rez him AGAIN and then
he is kicked from our group.  It was a fun and educational night for me.
Anyways I can see myself having alot of fun with this char.

Chris
