Most the uberguilds poopoo Trakanon these days, but most of them have
forgotten (since they don't kill him anymore, probably for a long
time) that his ease comes from only having 32k hp. His ae is still
very badass. If he had Velious dragon type hp (say 320k) he would be
one of the meanest baddies this side of ToV.
