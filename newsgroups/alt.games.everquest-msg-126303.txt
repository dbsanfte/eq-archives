I was wondering, since I spent the time to craft the Imbued Mithril Studded
Armour, why it would have the same fashion as newbie leather.  It seems to
me that the stats, though good, are not great.  Wouldn't there be more
incentive if the armour looked cool....  at least have a way to tell it
apart.

On that note, few in The Overthere asked me today about the armour I was
wearing.  They said they never seen plate armour on druid.  Now they said
they had all expansions and graphics on and so do I.  Can anyone tell me
what they see when they look at this armour...  Newbie Leather or ....
something else.
