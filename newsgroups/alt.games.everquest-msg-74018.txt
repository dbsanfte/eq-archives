Enchanter Soloing Strategies at Levels 12-15

PICK THE RIGHT SPOT:
Locate hunting camp near zone or near guard
Try to obtain a SoW

Set up spell as follows:
Gate
Tashan (Fear)
Weaken
Choke
Color Flux
Languid Pace
Root
Chaotic Feedback

** When soloing with a pet, forget Charm and Mez as available spells

PET PREPARATION:
Summon a pet (5th circle)
Buff the pet w/ Lesser Shielding and Mist and Strengthen
Tell pet to guard while you re-med to full mana
Practice Sense Heading and Beg (on Pet)

ATTACKING THE MOB:
Find Mob of Blue or White CON
Cast Tashan on Mob
Tell Pet to Attack
Step way back
Cast Weaken on Mob, then Choke.
Change Tashan to Fear in spell list
Monitor the two NPC's health (F8) while medding

If pet is dying:

A)	Cast repeated Color Fluxes, or repeat Languid Pace to stun it
while Mob regains upper hand
B)	Try to Root the Mob and blast it with Chaotic Feedback
C)	Cast Fear on the Mob, tell pet to Guard, Med and let Pet heal
(guarding caster) until Mob returns;  or

If pet is still dying:

A)	Root it and, if its health is low, Cast Chaotic
Feedback/repeat Choke - committing to killing it.  Or if health still
quite good, Root it and cast Gate and cut your losses.

If Root fails:

     A)  Run to zone / guard like little girl in pink party dress!
