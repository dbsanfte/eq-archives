Point is, what is a level 60 to do really? Accumulate more AA points?
That works for some, but I can see where many would find it way
boring. Nothing left but xp grinding.

I imagine Sony's intent *was* to give the ubers a reason to keep
playing. In the process, the rest of us were charged $30 for simpler
transportation - worth every penny to me, though it probably should
have been a patched feature rather than an extorted one.  :)
