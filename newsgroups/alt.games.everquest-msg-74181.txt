Umm, that would be John Steinbeck, arguably the greatest American
novelist.  Travels with Charlie is an account of his driving around
with a camper and his poodle Charlie, not really representative of his
strongest works.  I would recommend Cannery Row or The Pearl or The
Red Pony for examples of his storytelling, though Grapes of Wrath is
considered his best work.
