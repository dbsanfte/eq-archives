To have the orc run to a bridge is a very specific thing to do.
Specific, as in *by design*. Consider - the orc isn't waffling across
the water at some seemingly random point, he's going *to a bridge*,
which are universally recognized as good methods to cross water.

As pathing goes, this strikes me as some of the most reasonable
behavior I've seen in the game. Certainly it doesn't resemble a bug in
my opinion.
