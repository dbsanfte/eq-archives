}Probably the identically-named corpses have different identifier tags, and
}turning in a corpse from a fish you killed in the pool gives you a negative

}quest the "proper" way) will give you the positive faction hit.

Naah. I just did this about a month ago and it works fine.  The problem 
you're facing is probably that he won't accept the fish as a quest 
completion if your faction is below amiable.  The "ooh, get out of my 
sight!" message isn't you getting bad faction.  It's his way of saying, 
sorry chap, your faction's not high enough, try again later.

For getting to amiable faction I highly recommend Rabid bear and wolf 
pelts, given to the lady in the flying saucer, priestess whatsername.
