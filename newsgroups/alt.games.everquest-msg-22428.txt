Hehe, i tried the tuturial first thing when i got the game, will NOT reccomend
it to anyone.
You can ONLY do the stuff that the tuturial want you to rigth now, so if you
hear from a friend you can con a NPC, you cannot do it before its allowed in the
tuturial, so you sit and get pissed over all the wrong info you have gotten,
untill you find out it can only be used at a specific time.

Start a new char and practice on him instead, a LOT better.
