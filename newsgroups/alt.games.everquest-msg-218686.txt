Assuming you mean better ratio at the end there, the faster weapon is
usually better.  This is because (1) hate decays over time and the
faster weapon shortens the duration of your whiff fests (it takes a
lot less time to miss six times in a row with an 18 delay than with
a 40 delay) and (2) it appears that hate from melee damage is equal
to the amount of damage plus some constant per hit (i.e. hitting 5
times for 20 each time generates morehate than hitting once for 100),
although I've never seen a proof of (2) it certainly agrees with my
experience and that of every melee I've ever discussed it with.

You will do more damage with the 2hander once you're up a few levels and
start getting more damage bonus (tho there are many many cheap 2handers
that are better than that one), but will hold agro better with the dual
weapons.

You are correct.  At your current level the dual combo should also
outdamage that 2hander.  Tip:  Once you are in your 30s, and forever
after that, 2handers with delay of 28+ are much superior to 2handers
with delay 27-, even when the fast 2hander has a seemingly amazing
ratio (well, depending on how amazing).  see this link to understand
why:  http://lucy.fnord.net/dmgbonus.html
