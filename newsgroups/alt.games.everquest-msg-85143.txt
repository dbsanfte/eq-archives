20 warriors and 40 clerics *might* be able to take down some mobs, but
it would take forever and wouldn't exactly be realistic. Who the hell
has access to 40 clerics LOL. *EVERY SINGLE CLASS* has a role to play on
raids. If you aren't using each class's unique attributes then you
aren't achieving what you are capable of. You realistically need AT
LEAST 2 of every single class, just to keep up with buffs. You can't
pull most things with only 1 monk. You can't buff the raid or debuff the
mobs with only 1 shaman and 1 enc. No matter how many warriors you have,
you can't get enough hitting the mob at once to do enough damage to kill
anything.

If you had access to an infinite number of warriors and an infinite
number of clerics and 1 of each other class for a raid like Tunare, you
would have an infinitely long fight that the mob would NEVER lose hps
on. Have you actually ever fought anything above Vox and Naggy???
