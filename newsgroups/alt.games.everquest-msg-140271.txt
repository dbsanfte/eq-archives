Ah found the ref :
http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000650.html

Sounds like there will be some bannings / susspentions off the back of
this :

"We already have logs of who's done what, and we'd like to extend an
opportunity to those who may have tried something out "just for fun" to
take their actions back."

"Cheat in EverQuest; Bad Things Happen."

"it=92s no fun for us or for them when we take away their accounts."

Quoted out of context and in an incorrect order for maximum effect <G>
