How very odd -- I never saw my post or some of the responses.  
I had assumed it disappeared in the ether.

I hope everyone noted that that was a quote from a message
board, not something I did.  I was mainly interested in it
for the stats.

As you say, we all play(ed) for different reasons, and though
I'm pretty sure I'm not buying OoW and am retiring Maire and Bos
for good(*), I still find the mechanics interesting.  Particularly
during a very boring work day (SHH!  don't tell on me :)

* You'd have to see some of the mage spells to really understand
my abiding disgust with SOE.  My cat could have done a better job.
