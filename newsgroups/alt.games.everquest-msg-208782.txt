Spent about 6 hours yesterday duo-ing in the shops in Veksar, hoping to
upgrade my haste.  It got a little hairy because, try as I might, I could
not pull singles in there.  Since I have not gotten the item I want yet,
I'll need to go back, but I was wondering if anyone has first-hand
experience of whether a level 62 can pull single in that camp?  It'd be
worth it to ding first and then go back if that is the case.
