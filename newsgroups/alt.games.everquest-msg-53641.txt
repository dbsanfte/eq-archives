Keep checking there are like 3 or 4 sets of merchants in the Freeport
Evil Vendors area, Necro, SK, and Cleric.

I find I keep mine memmed all the time.  It is very useful and will keep
you from going OOM.  You can keep your health up with lifetaps.  I also
carry bandages around for when I really blow alot of mana, or had to
tank for my pet and got smacked around.  The addition of Leach at level
12 will help to keep you at full health and mana when combined with Dark
Pact.

It is essentially a buff that acts like a lifetap weapon proc.  It has a
chance of going off while meleeing.  I have never used mine, i bought
it, and after reading the description on it again, promptly moved it to
the back of the spell book. Because of it going off in melee, as a
weapon proc type thing, it's ideal for shadowknights, since they are a
melee class.

You are a Master of the Undead, both in creating them and destroying
them, you will also get a line of spells allowing you to charm undead. 
Undead still want to kill you also as I am sure you are starting to find
by level 8.

From 8 to 13 either the Chessboard (often overcamped) in BB, or the
Gears near the mino caves in Steamfont.  Keep in mind you will be KOS to
the dwarves and the gnomes (but not the gnome necros).  Not sure if you
will be KOS to the elves or not, my Cazic Thule worshipping Erudite
necro was mereley dubious but not sure about Innorruuk worshippers. 
Gather shadows works well for travel to the mino caves area.  You can
pretty easily avoid the dwarf guards, esp if you get a port, but I am
sure your used to that from your troll.  I fought from 8 to 12 both solo
and small grouped in Steamfont and rarely used any of the bone chips I
brought with me, as they are very plentiful.  You will not want to use
fear in Steamfont though from my exp, as there are too many wandering
mobs that are KOS to you, and if your pet gets smacked it will often
times leave off the original mob to deal with what attacked it.  I did
12 to 14 in small groups in Unrest then was working afternoons so left
and fought sisters of erollisi.  I am sort of searching for a new
hunting grounds now at 16.  I am sick of the Oasis scene and am trying
OT, by the outpost, but I am having difficulty with the mobs, going oom
after most fights etc, so i think i went a little too early.  To a large
extent with my necro I am trying things and zones I never did before, so
Kurn's tower might be a good idea for you if you want to do some of the
same.  I went there briefly with my druid, more to check it out than
anything.  I wasn't impressed but as a druid I am less oriented to
indoors, and undead fighting.
