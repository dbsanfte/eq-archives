Let's see this fuck up likes negative let's look at positive.  Anyone
remember a thing called 9-11 when two parents could not find thier son and
contacted SOE and asked if they could help next day the MOTD asked if anyone
seeing him either have him contact a GM or do it them selves his parents
were worried sick ??
Also from a personal point i am fighting depression and this game is one of
the few things that keeps my mind ff it the other is my GF with whom i have
had a healthy relationship with for the last two years and who also enjoys
one of the best games out there
