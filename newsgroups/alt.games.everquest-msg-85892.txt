This is a new song with the Luclin expansion. I have it but shouldn't have
wasted the plat. What this does it make and weapon able to hit magic
creatures. In other words a plain sword can now hit a wisp. These days most
players even in the low levels will get  some kind of magic weapon by level
10 or so which makes this song useless in my opinion. When the Luclin songs
1st came out they were mostly broken or useless, but since then they have
fixed amplification, which works well, and the lvl 49 Selos is nice too.
Otherwise..leave them alone.
Just my 2cp worth...
