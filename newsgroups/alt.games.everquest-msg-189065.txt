From the shadows, the mysterious "Scott T. Jensen" <stj@charter.net>
(if that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

Sure. To illustrate the solution most people have come to realize over
their EQ careers I'll just highlight a couple quotes.

You want a solution to your problem?

Get the fuck out of Karnors. The place is the natural endzone for the
idiot cycle.

Though funny I thought it was mostly abandoned these days as everyone
moved to Velks (or PoP).

...

That said, you take this stuff way too seriously. There's more than
one way to get a bad reputation in EQ, and one of them is by being a
whiner. Shit happens, move on, what these guys did isn't serious
enough to warrant obsession and reporting. They do enough damage to
themselves being turds in /shout.

Well you could have petitioned the abuse. Certainly not the camp
ganking.


>  And besides reporting this incident to the guild I'm about to join,
>reporting the players to their guild, and putting them on my No Rez list, is
>there anything else I can do? 

Do you feel a need to do anything else?
