I happen to agree heartily.
From my own experiences as a trainer, it is just after you learn something
that it is a great idea to teach someone else - you leran more by teaching,
somehwo, than by the process of being a student. It is always best to study
as if you were about to teach what you learn shortly afterwards. Helps
immensely.

Thanks for the reminder, Terry!


Happy easter one and all!
Shame there were no GM events - I suggest Giant Rabbits in the Karanas
giving out goodies, or random chocolate-egg ground spawns which can be
handed in for loot. Or perhaps they are miraculous meals, but cause a poison
DoT to low levels (If yer kids are not sick on choccy at easter, when can
they be?)

I still like the free rez idea tho...
