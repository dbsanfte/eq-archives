See here's the thing.  Most people just starting out don't have a
level 30 wizard friend to port them around.  And the game starts
you out in the farflung corners of the world, unless you all play
a limited set of class/race/religion choices.   For a group of
buddies to log on and get together to play, they used to have to
go thru incredible epic effort... and even then, they'd need to
find someone to bind them to their new location.

So they can play together.

They bought a multiplayer game... but they are stuck soloing, or
playing characters they don't want to play, or begging the ultra
high level porters (level 29?  OMG, he's a god!) for favors.

Don't get me wrong, I think there's a lot to be said for
difficult travel.  And there's a lot of truth in your post.

But on this particular issue, you don't really have much to say,
since you didn't start the game without the travel; that friendly
level 30 wizard took care of it for you.
