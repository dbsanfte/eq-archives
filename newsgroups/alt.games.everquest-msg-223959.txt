Well, for you - 
http://lucy.fnord.net

in the spell name entry box enter the effect you're interested in -
you'll get a description of it, a few items that have it and an option
to get the entire list in lucy's db of items with that effect.

For instance, type in "haste" and you'll get a list of all the different
types of haste out there:

http://lucy.fnord.net/spelllist.html?searchtext=haste&source=Live

click the one marked "haste"

http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=998&source=Live

click "117 more items"  (down a ways)

http://lucy.fnord.net/itemswitheffect.html?id=998

and you have a list of all items with haste on them.

There might be a better way - but that's what I usually use :)
