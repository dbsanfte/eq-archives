I got news for you.  Non-profit doesn't make something free from bias.
Every organization needs funding.  Where do you think AI gets it's funding?
I know where Fox News gets theirs.  I also know that Fox isn't beholden to
any one group.  How about AI, can they say likewise?

Now that Fox has opened up the media market, other media outlets are finding
out what their bias is costing them.  I count on the marketplace to keep Fox
unbiased.  What do you count on to keep AI unbiased?

It sense socialist tendencies in you, am I right?

Especially nice:
"The destruction, pictured graphically on television, appeared linked to
Israeli bulldozing of the houses from which the remnant of the resistance
forces were firing.
    " In fact, it covers the size of a large football field and constitutes
only about 10 percent of the housing in the camp, and a far smaller
proportion of the housing in the city, which was largely left untouched by
the Israeli incursion."

Also: "Families living in houses directly opposite the destroyed area have
told The Washington Times that Israeli soldiers, who temporarily occupied
their houses just before the final battle began, treated them without
violence and assured them: "You will not be harmed.""

Two nice specific articles, instead of giving you "go search
Wahshingtontimes.com."  Now, I'll give you two other sites.

www.memri.org - they translate Arab media into english.  Nice for seeing
what they're really saying.
www.factsandlogic.com - good middle east site in general.

Of course, I'm sure you'll just say "but they're biased."  Ah well, any
evidence I give you, you'll ignore.

Please, I don't have time to go hunting through six million articles.
You've already deprived me of the one day I have off this week.  It will be
seven more days before I see sunshine.

Again, you refuse to address the point I brought up (and no, I'm not going
to turn a blind eye while you try to bait and switch).  Isreal has stopped
several times.  The violence only got worse.  Why should Isreal consider
stopping again?

Nice bias there.  Anyways, your answer -- because Arafat is a terrorist.
The U.S. doesn't do business with terrorists.  Oh, and Clinton didn't get
much better from Arafat.  I deeply dispise Bill Clinton, but I will say that
he gave his all for that effort, and got screwed by Arafat.  I actually felt
bad for Clinton.

The same as I explain our WWII ally of the U.S.S.R.

Because Pakistan has offered certain consessions for our military
operations.  Because Pakistan has clenched their sphincters, and will be
careful not to necessitate our kicking their arses.

IIRC, we are pressuring them, and it looks like they'll bend to it.

I'm not even sure I can argue this anymore.  You'll not even concede that
the sky is blue... how can I prove anything to you?

Read the articles I posted.  At least I gave you direct links, instead of
directing you to the frontpage and telling you to search yourself.

Yes, environmental protections that even the EPA regards as misguided.
Ooooh, ahhhh scary.  Or are you still bent about ANWR?
