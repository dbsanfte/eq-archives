Sheesh, I can easily relate to not reading my whole post, but at least quote
the full paragraph where I addressed the mage quest. :)

>>The enchanter epic is the hardest in that none of it (except a few really
easy parts) are MQable.  Mage is even easier since the hardest piece CAN be
bought. :p<<

I'm working on my mage epic too...that sky piece will be a real bitch 'cause
I don't have 30-50k to buy the sky piece and my guild is SO tired of Sky.

As someone else said, mage epic is tedious.  Sky piece...freakin' Pegasus
Cloak...grrr and yawn. :(
