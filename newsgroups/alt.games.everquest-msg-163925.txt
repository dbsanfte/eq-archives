I've never had a problem being encumbered.  As far as I've been able to
tell, Verant's claim that it's just skill is correct.

Way back when people were thinking that Int/Wis had an effect on success,
one brave enchanter got very drunk, and proceeded to succeed in making 20
out of 20 velium fire opal rings.  They have a trivial over 250.  That kind
of clinched the whole thing for me.
