Since Win98 I've yet to find a NIC that wasn't supported right out of the
box.  Then again, I don't go looking for totally off-the-wall NICs.  If I've
heard of the name SOMEWHERE I'll likely buy it if it's cheapest though. :)
But the Dells, I always buy the integrated if that model has it.  If not, I
pick whichever is cheapest.

I gotta say, I really enjoy Win2k and WinXP.  On a Win2k machine I forgot to
buy a NIC so I stuck it in there before the first boot-up.  On my XP I
needed a modem and added that late.  In both cases I was never asked for
drivers, never told that I put in a new piece of hardware...it simply
accepted the hardware and installed the drivers with no muss, no fuss.  PnP
doesn't stand for Plug 'n' PRay anymore.
