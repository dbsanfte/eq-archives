See, now there's the lovely thing.  Once they've completely dropped the 
bandwidth, why, they could just run the trader -for- me while I'm not even 
online, and my girlfriend could use the phone. :)  Sure, flag it so I can't 
run another character at the same time, no prob.  But if it's running in a 
mode where there's no point in me even looking at the screen, why should I 
dial up to my ISP and have to worry about lagging out and all that?  Just put 
a button for 'log trader in/out' on the front screen, then after I toggle 
that, hang up.
