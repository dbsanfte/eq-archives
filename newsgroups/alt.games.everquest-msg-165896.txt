Amen to that. At 46, IMHO, you not only won't be able to solo there, but
you are contributing damned little to any group there and really just
taking up a slot that somebody else could use. Those mobs are just too
damned insane for people in their mid forties to deal with, and if they
hit you, you're going to die.
