No, its called not having a life.

A week to a normal casual player is playing a couple hours a night
for a week.

To an uber no life player they play 16+ hours per day.

I saw a level 65 on my server 3 days after release.
They were probably powerleveled by a couple other guilded
characters. Or the guy could have been 2 or 3 boxing.
