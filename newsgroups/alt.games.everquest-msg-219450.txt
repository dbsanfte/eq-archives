True and I did read it and intended to check it when I got in.
Unfortunately, I couldn't get in at that time and forgot they made such an
imbecilic change by the time I got in.  What made someone think that change
would help anyone?  I always thought it was not a smart function to use in
the first place, and anyone knowledgable to be able to use it without
getting everyone killed would also be smart enough to make the change
themselves.
