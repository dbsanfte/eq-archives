A pet takes a whole 1% of exp ONLY if it lands a killing blow.  Nonetheless,
it does a pretty fair share of damage and because of the extra damage, it
helps decrease downtime of the group.  Furthermore, your pet is going to be
the one working to save your butt if things go bad, while the rest of your
group runs for the zone.  I play a mage at 34, and if they tell me to drop
my pet, I'd ask them if the warrior is going to fight hand to hand as though
they were a monk.  Of course their answer will be no.  Your pet is your
weapon.  =)
