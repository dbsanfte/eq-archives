====================

Tangling with a puma and going batty

By Kathryn Balint
Staff Writer

-----------------------------------

I am Galiele, a level 4 human warrior who can be found cowering in the
wilderness outside of Freeport, a city in EverQuest's virtual world.

The main reason I've gotten so far as I have is because of Scott
McDaniel, executive director of marketing and public relations for
Sony Online Entertainment in San Diego.

He wasn't about to allow a journalist writing about EverQuest to brave
the land of monsters and mayhem alone for the first time.  His fear,
of course, was that I'd have a bad experience, get myself killed in
the first five minutes, and tell all of the miserable details.

So when it was time for me to give it a go, he was there every step of
the way.  His tutorial took three hours.

Galiele was born on one of EverQuest's 38 servers.  I picked her
hairdo, her face and her occupation, but didn't have a choice when it
came to her body.

She looks a little like I would in real life if I were five inches
taller and had major enhancements through cosmetic surgery.

Upon entering the bustling online world, Galiele immediately came
face-to-face with another player.

"Tago is looking at your equipment," my screen said.  Now where have I
heard that before?

He wanted to strike up a conversation, but Scott--who, at that point
was controlling my character--told him in no uncertain terms to go
away.

With that, Galiele sprinted outside the gates of the city and killed a
few rats.  She scored a few rat whiskers to sell later.  Apparently
this is a ritual that all new players go through to gain experience.

I detected a little bit of reluctance--or was it concern?--from Scott
when he turned over the controls to me and set me loose to hunt down a
few bats.  Of course, Galiele got bitten.

"You have to go through the pain of killing the bats," Scott said.
"It prepares you for exploring the outside world."

After much effort, I--er, Galiele--got a bat.  She went to loot its
corpse and found absolutely nothing.  After all that hard work.  Just
my luck.

When Galiele went to find her warrior guild leader, she called for
help.  A player named Zostrik showed her the way, and even gave her a
magical belt.

I swear Zostrik was one of Scott's employees at Sony, but Scott denies
it.  Why else would Zostrik be so nice to a perfect stranger?

"People want to promote the game and so they help other players who
are new to the game," Scott said.

When it became clear that Galiele was doomed with me at the controls,
Scott summoned his own character, Oakke, a stout little wood elf, to
take care of her.

Oakke showed up with a flower for Galiele.  Awwwww.  How sweet.

He then went to the bank, withdrew a bundle of money, and bought
Galiele weapons, armor and clothing.  We're talking first-class gifts.

Naturally, Galiele was quite smitten with the wonderful and wealthy
wood elf.

Oakke chaperoned Galiele wherever she wandered.  And every time she
got hurt, Oakke cast a spell or two to bring her back to good health.

Alas, it was time for Oakke and Galiele to part.

Scott sent me on my merry way with a map of EverQuest's virtual world.
He figured Galiele for a goner.

"You'll die," were his parting words.  "Everybody does."

That's what you think, Scott.

Galiele did come close to biting the dust when she tangled with a
puma.

But miraculously, a bunch of strangers appeared, killed the cat, then
whipped up a spell that healed Galiele.

OK, Scott.  Just promise me that nice bunch of strangers wasn't Sony's
public-relations team in disguise.

**--The day after this was written, Galiele died from a poison spider
bite. But, like in so many gaming worlds, she was resurrected.
