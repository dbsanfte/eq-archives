I connected to The Nameless server as my bard, and none of the songs worked
right.

They've made some changes to bards... for one they put up a the little spell casting
bar like casters get to show you when your song is going to take effect.  However, the
song only rarely actually does anything.  If you play it continuously, it's effect comes and
goes, but mostly goes :P

And it wasn't just me.  I did a /who and asked a couple of other bards on line, and they
said it was busted for them as well.

So Sony/VI have some work to do.

I do like the graphics for the half-elf female, though.  She looks pretty sweet.
And my high-elf enchanter has some nice graphics improvments.

I'm hoping by next week they'll have most of the problems patched.
