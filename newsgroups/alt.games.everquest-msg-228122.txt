I also agree that 5-6 is ideal size for group - however...

I would argue that LDoN has actually hindered the grouping experience.  So
many players will not even consider grouping unless the group meets a
specific make-up:  1 cleric, 1 chanter, 1 Puller, 1 tank, and then the other
2 classes are negotiable - prob another dps and a caster.

I've never been able to get a group of melee char's to try an adv...  "We
gotta have a healer"  and I've seen many cases of casters who won't go into
dungeon without a crack dealer of some sort...

fortunately, Pick-up groups haven't fallen to such rigidity yet...
