Depends on my mood.

My two mains are listed below.  If I'm feeling gregarious, hilarious
and arthritis-free, I fire up the bard.  Bards is fun to roleplay too!

If I'm in a calmer mood I play the Cleric - I find RP'ing him to be
quite soothing.  Bedside manner and all, I guess.  Easier on the
hands, too.
