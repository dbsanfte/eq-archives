Strange thing is - I have to install the mouseware, or at least SOME
drivers from Logitech, as I use an iTouch keykoard (great to hear
mp3's while playing) and I with my last installation
of Win2k (not XP, mind you) I was able to scroll the chat window
whilst in Unreal Tournament I was NOT able to map the scroll function
to _anything_ (which had worked some time long ago on my
Win98 or with other drivers). Haven't tested it with my recent
installation yet, though, but I bet it will be the same.

Don't know about XP, but it seems in 2k there is a way to use
logitech-drivers AND scroll in the chat window....
