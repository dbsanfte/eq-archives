I'm sorry, I just love the title of this thread.  No, I have no problems 
being booted.  I manage to get myself booted regularly and with extreme 
ease.  Last night, I was even booted 3 times in 20 minutes.  It's easy.  
Anyone could do it.

If you're having problems being booted, perhaps you just need to switch to 
a more thoroughly borked ISP...
