Paludal is great to solo in from about 14 to the low 20s.  Best zone
for quick experience I know of.  Too quick, actually, as you can't
make enough pp to buy gear or spells, or keep up your skills, you will
level so fast.

At 14 start killing the bugs at the Hollowshade zone in.  I think
there are similar level mobs at the Shadeweaver zone in as well.  When
those green out find a hallway away from fiends with a few static bugs
and no wandering bug.  As those static bugs turn light blue, some of
the tougher shrooms will start turning blue.  Kill shrooms and what
blue bugs you can find and you will be in your 20s before you knew
what happened.

One drawback to this is you will be level 20, have 3pp to your name,
be missing 80 percent of your spells and still be wearing the tattered
tunic you got for turing in your guild note.
