Did you try petitioning?
This has happened on Venril, and a GM resolved it somehow (not sure of any
details, but their instance was fixed)

VZ is about 200 times harder than TZ (some would say hes 1 of 2 "tough" mobs
in PoTime, refering to Innie as the second)
TZ is just all about heal power. Theres no ae's, adds, spells etc that need
to be dealt with during the battle (the only one he does cast can be
avoided)

Grats on obstacle 1 of 2, standing before you and candy land (3 phase 5 gods
are on a par with Saryn/TT for difficulty..)
