My friend and I are fairly new to EQ.  I play a 15th level Dark Elf
Necromancer and he has a 15th level halfing Druid.  We were fighting
beetles around the guard tower in North Karanas on Friday night, and
we discovered that AOE spells are not the smartest idea around the
guards.  My friend hit a beetle with his AOE rain spell and few
minutes later a guard ran over and started beating on the beetle. 
Needless to say, the beetle quickly died and next thing we know the
guard is chasing my friend's Druid.  He starts toward the zone line
and, of course, his SOW faded and he was toast. :-( It was an eye
openning experience for both of us.  At least I got to learn the
lesson with out the experience loss. :-)

A quick question, with items and buffs, my Dark Elf's Magic Resistance
is 45.  Is this good for a level 15 character?
