Ah. So they're offensive because people choose to be offended by them.
Cool.

Still not good enough reason for me not to use them.

As I said, I generally don't care about the words and use them as
"normal" except in certain circumstances. As such, however, every
other word out of my mouth isn't an obscenety. In fact, in reality,
it's pretty rare for me to use them. But, when I do, they're just
normal words to me.
