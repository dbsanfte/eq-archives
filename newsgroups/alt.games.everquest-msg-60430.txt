I don't have a clue what you are on about there. You mean people are
roleplaying females and using it to their advantage..cool, let them, maybe
it'll teach some gullible idiot not to be so gullible when faced with a nice

Not necessarily but I wouldn't bother asking, it's a roleplaying  game not a
dating game, they want to play a member of the opposite sex and ROLEPLAY the
character, fine...if someone takes this roleplaying to mean that they should
"put the moves on them" then more fool them.
