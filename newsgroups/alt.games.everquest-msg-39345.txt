Of course, all you have proven here so far is that Stamina affects time to
drown.  You have not shown that swimming skill does or does not affect time
to drown.  For you next test, you should raise your swimming skill on at
least on of those characters, and see if that affects the time to drown as
well.  But that was an excellent start on the experiment.
