 Pulling in Kunark isn't that bad (other than Chardok Royals) and I
don't find it that risky. Chain pulling is really the way to go in
Kunark though. It wasn't until Verant released The Hole that feign
pulling was really shown to be less than useful.

 Just another reason to side with Giants.. Feign pulling works much
better in Skyshrine than it does in Kael. Plus your jboots still work.
Can't beat that. However, as a way of comparison what AC/HP do you list
for warriors and rogues?

 I don't agree. We regularly have at least 4 monks on an event. Why
exactly is it a waste?
