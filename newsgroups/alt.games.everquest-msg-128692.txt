it'd definitely be too hard to do at 16 solo . . . on the plus side, human
team thinks they own PC and they try to solo (gank-tastic !)

work up your swimming skills, get some groups, level to 22 fast fast fast
(usually 1 day)

you CAN solo in Mseru after you get animal-fear @ 22 . . .keep harmony up
and you can do well


until then, just group for PC, or shop for other solo spots
