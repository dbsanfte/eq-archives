yes...  Create a Social.... and bind it to your hotkeys.

example...

Create social called HEAL
Line 1:   /g Casting Healing on %T
Line 2:   /cast 1
Line 3:   /book


The first line will in turn will tell your group (if you want use "/say") to
announce who you are healing...

The command "/cast 1" refers to the order of the spells you have memorized
from 1 - 8.   ie "/cast 4" will cast the spell you have memmed in the fourth
spot from the top of the bar...

The command "/book" opens your spell book so you can continue meditating.

NOTE that %T is the text command for TARGET.

For me the above social....is preceeded by an F1-F6 depending on group
member....

Soooo....

F2, Hotkey 1 will result in selecting the appropriate target, announcing
that you are casting healing on him, actually casting the spell and the
meditating to regenerate mana.

Obviously you may want to leave out the "/book".  I thought that inclkuding
this command might help in the creation of other socials.
