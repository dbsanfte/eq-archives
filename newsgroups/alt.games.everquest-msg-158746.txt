This is an issue of knowing your role in the group.  When I get in a group
with a druid or another wizard, I check to see who is on evac, root snare,
debuff, etc...  If I am designated for evac, or am the only one in the group
with evac, I have it loaded and almost always insure I have enough mana to
cast it.  At level 26 (stated level of this wizard) you should have that
spell loaded.  Since the group had a ranger, snare and root should have been
covered.  That would leave the wizard with 7 spell slots to fill (one being
take up by evac), One cold nuke (Frost Shock), one fire nuke (Flame Shock),
one magic nuke (Garrisons Mighty Mana Shock), Cancel Magic, Tishan's Clash,
this would still leave room for two AE nukes if the group needed them.
