the next time i complain about idiots in 50+ encounters that do things like
loot no-drop items, and then ask who wants to roll . . . well, i'll have to
remember the roots of these people . . . ORC HIGHWAY !

my newly-dinged 14 cleric was partnered with a warrior and monk, who
suddenly recruited an enchanter

while they worked on the orcs, i tried to get heals off as i was pounded by
adds . . .

hopes this counts as practice in posting logs, because the log is always
funnier than getting the story second hand
