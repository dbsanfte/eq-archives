There are all sorts of items that can be bought/made/looted/foraged (didn't 
know about the foraged one actually) that will give a bonus to fishing.  
There are various items in the game that can be looted that will give 
bonuses in a variety of skills, including a number of non tradeskills, like 
dodge, pick locks, various casting skills, etc.  There are also the Grand 
Master Trophies that give a 5% bonus to the tradeskill that is used to make 
the final trophy.
