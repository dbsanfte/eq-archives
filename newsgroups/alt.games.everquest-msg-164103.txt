rofl.  You've "heard" this, have you?  So you've swallowed your
preferred brand of "political correctness" whole?  That certainly
fits with your statement above.  Your words clearly imply that the
<only> form of racism in the USA today is "affirmative action".
By claiming an identity between the two you have excluded any other
possible form of racism (leaving off for now any argument as to
whether affirmative action is indeed racism).  This statement is
either incredibly naive or a grotesque lie in its denial of reality.

I have yet to see even one anti-"affirmative action" statement in
a public forum that wasn't either a selfish whine or the naive and
uncritical repetition of something that the person had "heard".
So in that sense you're half-right, selfishness isn't mandatory,
willful blindness is sufficient all on its own.

"Affirmative action", by the way, isn't a thing.  It's an idea that
is meant to inform policy.  That idea is that we should take direct
action to attack the clear and present results of current and past
racist behavior by individuals and organizations.  The fact that our
governments have done a pretty horseshit job of implementing it in
many cases doesn't detract from the ideal itself in any way.  It's
one thing to make sure some disadvantaged folks get a decent shot at
schooling/jobs/housing that have been kept away from them.  It's
another entirely to create entitlement programs with no plan in place
for their (early) termination.  Or to put in place absurd legal barriers
to dismissal that in some cases have had the effect of arranging it so
that a "minority" person can draw a paycheck forever after claiming
discrimination by a non-minority supervisor, no actual work required.
I am not at all unaware of how badly our governments perform at so very
many things.  To use that bad performance in an attempt to demonize a
truly worthy ideal is, however, extremely reprehensible as far as I am
concerned.
