  If you're not going to put text in the body of your message, please put
(NT) or something equivalent in the subject line.  Since the patcher is
causing my computer's CPU utilization to go THROUGH THE ROOF I can't tell if
the lack of text is because my system is slow or because you didn't put any
text in the message.

  Anyhow, I'm having the same problem.  Apparently some people are able to
download the files... I'm not though.  It just slows my computer down to a
grinding halt.  I don't understand why what is essentially a glorified,
specialized FTP (or probably more accurately, HTTP) client needs to chew up
this much of my system's resources.  If this is an example of the efficient,
optimized code found in the Luclin engine, I'd better build my computer with
a beefier processor than I'd planned. ;)
