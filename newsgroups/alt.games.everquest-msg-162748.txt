I have a 64 Necro, been playing him since Feb 2000 with a couple of
breaks thrown in.

If you are just looking for a casual character, than pick whichever one
you want to play the most.  Maybe you hate gnomes, or like DEs, want to
roleplay some, whatever.  In other words, for a casual character there
is no bad choice.  And judging from the relatively small amount you want
to spend in twinking, I am guessing this is going to be a casual
character.

If you are looking to make the best Necro possible at 65 you want an
iksar.  The regen says it all.  Put all points into INT, any left over
into STA.  The faction doesnt matter as there are plenty of places to
level around Cabilis until you can hit the moon, where again faction
doesnt really matter.  The xp penalty is the only technical downside.  I
personally wouldnt like playing a lizard either, but thats subjective
bias.

Next best would be DE or Erud.  Gnome and Human are at the bottom.  I
personally play a DE.
