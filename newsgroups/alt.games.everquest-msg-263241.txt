I think I'll keep the current card for now and not buy the used 9200 I
was offered.  I checked the web site (Tom) and the specs for 9200 is
slightly slower than FX5600.  I mean why fix something that is not
broken and FX5600 runs at full frame at 100% clip and all spells
effect on in most zones.  PoK is the only major problem area at peak
time.
