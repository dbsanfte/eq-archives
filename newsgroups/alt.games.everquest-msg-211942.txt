i don't understand...in velks he got 60, in PoI he got 80...both times

*dies* ooops

i forgot to add in the ~700dd per fight that the beastlord said he was doing
via spells

and the pet's spells don't parse

sorry, sorry

fine, so the bst kicked all our asses

he's got the same problem as me...good weaps, bad dps

if that's stupidity, well, i s'pose i'll just have to take your word on it,
reasoning to be too dumb to realize that on my own

well .... the pet was hasted with enc haste, and unless the people in the
group had regular gear + 40-90k haste items, they all had 22-31 % haste

is there a big difference between 92% haste and 101% haste? at the mid 50's
levels, no, because of the haste cap

(right?)

well, bst dps would come out higher....ranger wasn't using spells for
damage, warrior wasn't using a proc'ing weap, and i wasn't either

my dps would still be under 40, as would the ranger's, and the warrior's
would be over 60 (but lower than 80 =b )

the stats of 1 item will up my dps twofold?

i'll get my epic, just not asap, since i expect i'll still have this problem
