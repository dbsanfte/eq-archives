Not killing mobs too fast?  Where you been?  This is about the perfect
group.
You can drop the chanter for a bard if anyone's into that as well.  -
same goes for any of your 'chanter' selections below, a necro is a far
3rd possilbe for the chanter position as well - you can maybe drop the
druid for wizard too, won't be running around as fast, but you won't
need to, or if you go war clc brd wiz, probably a much better group,
faster running than druid, can snare (both brd & wiz) better beat-down
on stuff - yeah I'd say that's the perfect group.  only other thing I
can think of would be loose the dr00d or wiz for a shaman, no ports but
buff the war out the gills, and handle all sorts of other goodness, also
makes a good almost tank in some situations.

Not having a cleric won't cut it at high levels. If you just have a
friendly group, sk & pally both suck, but it's workable.

Chanters always get the best pet (well bards at some levels can outdo
them I think).  My current favorite at 54 is a dual weilding hasted
rock-fiend - takes anything in the grey down - including me - often :)

How about 4x bard :)

Also there's the AE group, chanter bard wiz mage necro druid - mix and
match to whatever you want. Clerics and shaman can also ae to some
extent, but not very well.  My favorite groups have always been AE, for
some reason they seem to be hard to come by :(
