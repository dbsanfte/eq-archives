Summoning mobs are few and far between before your hit the higher
level mobs in Karnor or Burning Woods as it's an innate mob ability
that a lot of lower level mobs simply don't have.  Cazel in Oasis is
one exception, a high level mob in a low level zone that summons and
is KoS to all, a fairly bizarre design decision if you ask me.

On the other hand once you get to 60-65 a non-summoning mob is rare
rather than the other way around.  Sitting down or ending up low on
health yourself often earns a summon (and more often than not death a
short while later in the latter case) but the worst most lower level
mobs can do is lumber in your direction until you stand up again.
