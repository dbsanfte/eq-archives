This was one of the main gripes I had about being a guild master. You can
never know who is in or gone from your guild. The closest you can come to it
is writing down everyone who joins your guild ( unless you are the only
officer theres no way of keeping track of that either). Then every month you
can do a /who all for every guild member on your list to see if they are
still in. You'll have to ask those who are anon cos it dosnt show sometimes.
Its ridiculous and the main flaw of guild leading.

I tried the database but theres no way to get all your members to enter on
it when they join and they are less likely to take themselves off when they
leave.
