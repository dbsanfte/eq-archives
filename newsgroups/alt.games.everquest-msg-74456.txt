Two newbie questions.

I am a level 6 wood elf ranger. I have accumulated about 15pp. What
should I be looking to purchase with it? Any special armor or weapon
that I should look for?

Secondly, I have visited the ranger guild and even completed a quest,
but I have not figured out how to receive special skill training? Is
there a way to join the guild, or what?
