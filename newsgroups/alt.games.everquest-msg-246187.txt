I wasn't saying that. But you have to admit that PoK takes away some of the  
experiences that new characters can only obtain in their native region. So 
let me change what I said in the previous post to maybe: In order to enter 
PoK, players should have to complete a certain quest, geared for lvl 10-15, 
near their home town. Any better?
