Actually they do regularly outdammage monks . I dont really mind that as
much as some , but lying about it isnt gonna help your case :) I have seen a
1800 1400 1500 3 shots before in less than 2 ticks .

What I do mind is that monk defense was nerfed. With 3 melee only classes
the natural selection would be best offense , best defense, and best balance
among offense and defense. Warriors win best defense hands down. Rogues
should be best offense though they get beat every once in awhile. Monks used
to hold best balance . Now they have no circumstance where they are the best
choice. Monk shaman will no longer be better than warrior shaman. Monks no
longer solo the best of the 3 .

Monks have become rogues without the thieving skills and missing some
dammage. Long live the poor damn monks. Mines retired untill the rectal
cranial inversion gets fixed . Till then I will play my chanter and be
happy.
