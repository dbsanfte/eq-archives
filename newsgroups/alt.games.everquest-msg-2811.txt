Jo,

I play a melee type and let me tell you. I hate Unrest. It is hard for me
to do my job there to protect the casters in situations like you mention.
The exp is good, but the overpulls, trains, and add-ons can be
frustrating. I think the only thing to have is good communication and to
just keep working on it. Any zone where you have mid teen characters
hunting with upper 30 and 40 in the same zone is just bound to be
frustrating. I would suggest two possible options there. One is the old
stand by. Find a place on the wall and be cautious pulling. The other is
to try a room of one or two and make sure to watch for trains and
add-ons.

Sounds to me like your doing your job though. Keep it up, and just
remember that Unrest is a hell-hole zone no matter where you fight there.
