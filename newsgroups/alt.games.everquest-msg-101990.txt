  This is so futile. ;)

  I'm getting the sense that you think that you think somebody looking at
your character is some sort of invasion of privacy.  Verant, in their
infinite wisdom, have decided what measure of "privacy" characters in EQ
have.  They decided not to include hiding items your character is visibly
(in most cases) wearing within that realm of privacy, quite reasonably I
believe.

  They have provided to us all the option of not receiving notification when
somebody inspects us, so that those who, for some REALLY silly reason, get
uncomfortable with the thought that another character is looking at their
character's equipment and/or description box and are saved whatever
annoyance or trauma they may experience from knowing they're being
inspected.

  It is not "rude" behavior to use this "ability" we all have to inspect
others, even without asking.  I do not have to ask permission to look at
someone in real life, I feel that it's an absolutely ridiculous notion that
I should have to do so in a virtual world.  You're give up that level of
privacy the minute you leave your home, or log in.  You may, for some
strange reason, may find my looking at your character ANNOYING, but that,
I'm afraid, does not make it RUDE behavior.  I may accidentally killsteal
you, and you may be annoyed by it, but it doesn't make me rude.  I think
somebody mentioned that bizbee is annoyed by it when people DO ask him for
permission to inspect him (which may be "strange" and "uncommon" behavior,
but really it makes no less sense than being "annoyed" by getting inspected
without permission)... he gets annoyed, but bizbee can't validly claim (in
my opinion) that the other party is being rude.

  Or, in another example, a person who's really sensitive about their
appearance (maybe they're overweight, have a skin condition, or whatever)
might get uncomfortable if I glance in their direction... again, it's not
RUDE behavior, however uncomfortable, annoyed, or whatever, it make might
them feel.  And anyway, if they didn't notice me glance at them, it wouldn't
cause them any worry.  Now, intentionally making a person uncomfortable,
that's rude.  Behaving normally and not taking in to account every
individual's possible quirks and weird sensitivies, is not rude... it may
not be walk-on-eggshells polite, but it's not rude.  What determines whether
or not a person's behavior is rude is more based on their intentions than
the other person's perceptions and preferences.

  I usually do ask people about their equipment rather than inspect them (I
find this a better way to fulfill one's curiosity about an item for a
practical matter anyway.)

  If DO you see me inspect you and I haven't asked, it's for one of six
reasons:

1) I am curious about your equipment, but get the impression that you might
be too busy to answer me (or you are AFK).
2) I am curious about your equipment, but am in a hurry or am simply not in
the mood for conversation.
3) I'm doing it for roleplay reasons (I try to play one of my character's as
not particularly chatty with strangers who prefers to observe people from a
distance before jumping right in with questions about a person's equipment,
profession or life's story).
4) I am curious about several items a person is using and don't want to
burden them, or myself, with a laundry list of inquiries.
5) I have items that I think you may be able to use, that I want to give
away, but I'm not certain of your familiarity with those items (mostly
applies to newbies or lower level guildmates).
6) Accident.

  All of these reasons are either completely harmless or benevolent, so I'm
never being rude.  I know that a minority of people are bothered by being
inspected, and I know that the majority of them have the notification turned
off... and I know that the even smaller minority who keep the notifications
on while being annoyed by them usually are the sorts of people who seem to
LIKE being annoyed.  Therefore I feel silly "walking on eggshells" when I
ask someone if they would terribly mind my inspecting them.  When I'm
inspecting someone, it's probably because I'm either trying to save time
(mine or theirs), or I'm about to do them a favor... and in the former
situation, asking first sort of defeats part of the purpose.

  Anyway, inspecting and not asking first doesn't live up to your
"politeness boundries", but your politeness boundries are just that...
YOURS.  What is outright rude may be another thing entirely.  You have the
right to deny favors to anyone you wish on whatever basis you wish, of
course, but I think you're mentally "condemning" a lot of people as rude who
really are quite far from it.  But since you keep quiet about your thoughts
and don't vocally accuse a person of being rude for not living up to your
standards, at least you're not being rude.

  I'm done with this topic for the month. :P
