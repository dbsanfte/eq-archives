I am going through a somewhat similar thing on Povar, except it has nothing
to do with a guild...

I have been in contact with 2 senior guides and one real live GM (yeah,
surprise surprise, they're actually real).  Here's what I was told to do.
/report zone /report zone /report zone until I leave or they leave.  While
it's in no way the best way to go, it's a way.  Harassment is something that
can get someone suspended if not completely banned, and it's not tolerated
by Verant.

If another guide tells you that if they don't see it they can't do anything
ask to speak with a senior guide.  Scota, Welly and Tuvene are some of the
best guides I have seen on any server and will take your complaints quite
seriously.  I have never been brushed off by one them.  Now, I have been
brushed off by some of the others, but never one of those three.  They will
listen to you and offer you the best options that still fall into the
guidelines of Verant.

Now, there are some GM's who are bastards, that I can't help with, there has
been so much change in the past few years, I can't even begin to tell you
who I would go to.

In the meantime, if you see this guy in the same zone, petition immediately.
Tell the petition that you have had past problems with this guy causing
problems, i.e. training you and you would like a guide to come to the zone
and watch.  Then go about your business as if nothing had happened.  While
you might not get a guide for a while, it's inevitable that 1 out of 5 times
will land you with a decent guide who will help you.
