Possibly.  I was referring to the argument heard here relatively
often that VI has a difficult time deleting characters to explain
why they don't do it.

From my experience, there's absolutely NO way they can't
delete a character if they need/want to do so.   They don't
for some combination of simple reasons having to do with no
pressing technical need to do so and user/marketing desires
to have characters available if the user decides to return.

It's simple:  no known character deletions (other than for banned
accounts, let's say) != inability or even "bother" to do so.   They're
got plenty of reasons to retain characters and little, if any, reason
to delete them.   Customers who imply technical ability from
observed behavior are treading a slippery slope.

The simplest answer is one you expressed:  any modification of the
database *may* produce errors.   As someone with more than
passing experience with database and customer support, the last
thing they want to do is anything non-critical which could involve
database restores, etc.   That's a far more likely reason for the
observed character retention than any technical "bother" that
may be associated with character deletions.
