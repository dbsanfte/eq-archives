If you are using the snare class spell just to stop runners, then it isn't
necessary to cast it before engaging them.  Often in a group I see
people casting snare only on runners... which is to say -not- on the
50% of mobs engaged who don't manage to run at all, due to being
nuked to death or because only the last mob of a cluster will run...
I'm not a big fan of this approach, but if you are using it, then a
faster casting snare would be in order, and duration unimportant.

This is the same choice as the one between Root (and later Immobilize)
and Enstill... root casts faster but doesn't last as long, while Enstill
lasts longer, but takes longer to cast.  If what you need is an emergency
park, use Root, if what you need is something long term then you go with
Enstill.
