Hi Rumble.

Actually I just got this Thursday and basically just installed it and got it
running. When I was trying to learn the programming software that came with
it, is when I realized I hadn't thought this through all the way. Like how
do I tell it to move and do other things quickly when you have to "shift" it
to another layer of commands and other things I have had to learn to do
simultaneously using the keyboard.

So, at the moment, I'm not much help. I can see (I think) the potential
here.  I'm hoping that the great people in A.G.E. will come through as they
usually do, with some good pointers, tips, help, etc.
