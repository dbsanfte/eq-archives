It is indeed, I have a couple "better" neck items, but I've been perma EB since
a friend gave me a Staff of the Waterwalker in my early 40s, and every time
I go EB free, I feel naked.  I feel strongly enough about this that the only
realistic strategy would be to substitute a better EB item in for the amulet,
then I could get a better neck, but of course that would mean having to
balance the new EB item against whatever -it- is replacing.  Current substitute
item is Sebelite Scale Collar, or that pearl neck from last halloween.

I've considered the shadel ring, but it seems to go for 3K to5K in MT bazaar,
and that seemed steep.  Where does it drop, FG?  At any rate, I can keep
watching Bazaar for one more moderately priced.

The stats on SBOC have always seemed mighty nice to me, though,
ignoring haste, and its a personal dream item since my early days
in velious.   I saw one drop, and had a good laugh with my guild
over the idea that we stay in KD till every real melee got one so
I could roll against the melee shaman for it.  Stuck in my mind over
five more levels on that cleric and 50something more on this one... hard
to talk me out of a sentimental piece like that.  Of course if you
can point me at a better haste item, and/or a belt with Flowing Thought...
well I can be realistic!

AC 12 seems like a massive drop in AC, while I feel my AC should be
moving in the upwards direction.  That would make this go in the "resist
gear" category.

I have seen this for sale in bazaar, but it doesn't look like much of
an upgrade, and I expect I'll probably get the drop off UP boss mobs
soon enough, my guild seems to do them a couple times a week and
they drop that item a lot.

Right click root seems silly.  Isn't it 4.5 second cast?  I use Immobilize
almost exclusively, because it casts fastest, and thats far more important
than lasting longer or casting cheaper.  1.8 seconds is a long way from
4.5 seconds.

No faithstone yet, I keep meaning to buy one of those, I'll start looking
by name for them in Bazaar, they don't seem to show up on the global
searches for dwarf cleric gear, if they are in there at all.

OK, I've seen Dwarven Plate, Enchanted Dwarven Plate, Imbued Dwarven Plate,
Brellium, and Underfoot.  I think there is also a Enchanted Imbued Dwarven Plate

but I"ve never seen it.  Which of these is the top end product?  They all seem
to retail (by different traders) for about the same amount of cash, 15Kpp per
piece.
I've not seen Underfoot bracers specifically, these items have been spread out
across several body parts.


I did miss a body part, I'm wearing Cloak of Truth on back.
