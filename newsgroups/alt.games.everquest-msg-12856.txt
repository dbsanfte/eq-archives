	Just make sure you get it resized.  Regular-sized crafted is
extremely heavy for a gnome.

	Yes, I found that to be true as well.  My 2HB skill still
isn't maxed, even at 46th level, mainly because I never had a decent
2HB weapon.

	That's one of my fave screenshots, too.

	The Giant Skeletons in the Rathe Mountains are great for
soloing from about 23rd level and up.  Kill one, bind wounds to half,
sit down for a few minutes to heal back an extra bubble, and then kill
another skellie.

	I dunno where I came up with that, but I knew from the time I
created her that if I ever got her up to 20th, her last name would be
"Kneeslasher."

	(Although I was very tempted to make her last name "Hold.")
