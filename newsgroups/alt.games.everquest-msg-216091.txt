I was in an LDoN pickup group (MM) last night:
55 Warrior
55 Paladin (me)
53 Ranger x2
52 Cleric x2

I had VoQ (yay MGB!), dunno if the Clerics or Rangers had mana regen or
not.  We're doing a kill the boss.  I'm concerned about doing it with
neither a mezzer nor a mana regen buffer, but I can pull singles with
just the occasional double, we have snare, and half the mobs my earlier
trip to MM were undead which makes us a decent DPS group.

So we start out ok, I get two on my fifth pull and my mood begins to
deteriorate when a Ranger says "have pally use Pacify".  With some
dificulty I restrain myself from pointing out that if I wasn't using
Pacify that pull would have been at least 5 including 2 chealers.
The next pull the mob gets feared at 50%.  Fortunately, it is snared
and I pulled it well away from the room and it is the last healer from
that room.  Then the same Ranger messes with "a bitten victim".  He is
pleased with his gnome pet.  I manage to not say anything, but I am
getting pretty annoyed, which distracts me from realizing that the
only good move at this point is to flee the group and never look back.
The next pull is immediately feared and we wipe...

*** casting offensive spells (Clerics were taking turns healing)

wiped us'
...
[Mon Sep 22 01:32:24 2003] You tell your party, 'goodnight, i'm not 
staying in a group with people who cast fear in dungeons'

The Ranger who defended her was her guildmate (not the Ranger who
demanded that I use Pacify when it was obvious that I was already
doing so).  I don't imagine I'm very popular among the <Dark Dragon
Ministry> now, and I don't care.  I just cannot accept a L52 Cleric
making that error... twice!

Notes:
1) Epitaph of Life casts in 4 seconds and gives the message
"Someone staggers under the weight of divine words."
2) Dread of Night casts in 1.75 seconds and gives the message
"Someone has been instilled with the dread of night."
3) I'll leave it to you to guess what message I saw and the length
of time between "###### begins to cast a spell" and the message
