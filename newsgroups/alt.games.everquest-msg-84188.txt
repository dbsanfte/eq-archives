I have experienced the 1018 more frequently recently.  However, I attribute
it to the fact that i am sharing a dial up connection between 2 computers.
My main computer is windows XP and sometimes things will run just dandy.
However, sometimes i will instantaneously go LD while the other computer is
still running in game with no problems.  That is bizarre to me.  Anyway, I
have never had to wait for then a few minutes to get back in the game.  One
thing I notice is that when I get the "you have been disconnected" message I
can actually see my character in the game on the other computer, usually
after trying to get back in the game on the first or second attempt my
character will disappear.  However, I have seen it where my character will
stay in the game for up to 20 minutes.  Not sure why it would take that
long, but what rebooting does is to make sure that your internet connection
isn't still transmitting information to Verant saying that your character is
in the game.  LOL, just disconnect your connection and reconnect :>)
