Hmm, actually, are those spells available anywhere but in the bazaar?  I 
haven't bought any since the redesign of the bazaar, but seem to recall 
the old one was the spot where the merchant was located  for these and 
several other interesting spells.

Speaking of which, what OTHER spells are available only in expansion 
areas?  What are people going to have to do without, for the moment, 
given "old world vendor only" sourcing?  And can any of those spells be 
researched with "old world only" drops?

And how about trade skills... how many items won't be makable yet, no 
matter how good you get your skill, because you can't buy or find 
critical components.

How about those feats I was thinking about, like Throw Stones, how many 
of those are not going to be usable because the book or person you hand 
it to isn't in the Old World?

This new server might be more different than I'd first assumed.
