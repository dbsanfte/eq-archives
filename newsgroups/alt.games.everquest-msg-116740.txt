When this happened to me (several corpses, at level 59 /cry), the lead GM or
Prexus told me that actually "its 3 hours *period*..  if it lets you rez
after 3 hours offline, then consider yourself lucky.. if it poofs/expires,
im sorry but hard luck".

Sometimes it doesn't count when your logged off, but if it does count,
"thats how it was intended"

I scrutinised the web-site rules when it happened, mailed Zrinic back and
forth for a while, and took a nice long EQ break (losing a whole yellow in
59, when 1 blue from 60 was kindof hard to swallow)

I too have received rezzes the next day Dan.
