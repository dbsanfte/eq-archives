Hello,

I have a 11th lev Vah Shir Beastlord, witha wis of 123; my weapon is a
|Spine Chill Spear, with shock of ice effect.

my question: while fighting, i get a message " your will is not
sufficient to command this weapon" . Ok, what do i have to do to make my
will sufficient? raise my wis? by how much???

thanks for any help...
