Well, just in case there are other eq-morons out there like me who couldn't
figure out these instructions without a lot of experimentation, here's
something a little more explicit.

In the old interface, under Options, under Keyboard, find the "Target Me"
command. It probably has F1 in the top slot and NOKEY in the bottom slot.
Right click on the bottom slot and press 'e'. A couple Next pages away,
find the "Toggle Target" command. It most likely has TAB in the top slot
and NOKEY in the bottom slot. Right click on the bottom slot and press 'e'
there too.  Now hit Back button until you're all the way out of Options.

The reason it works (or so I'm guessing) is that when you press 'e', eq
interprets that to mean "Target Me" then "Toggle Target". I'm also guessing
the reason it chooses *that* particular order (rather than "Toggle Target"
first and "Target Me" second) is because that's the order they appear in
the Keyboard Options. Lucky us!
