Odd... I feel exactly the opposite way.

I enjoy the post 50 game immensely, taking a good group and exploring the
various dungeons....

I've tried to start a few newbies, but I generally get to the point where if I
have to bash one more rat, I'm just going to scream.

Pre 50 you seem to get the same choice of either Ill Omen > FM > OT > DL, or
soloing, both of which bore me to tears.   Trying to convince 5 friends to get
on low level characters so we can explore one of the low level dungeons seems
to be an exercise in futility.
