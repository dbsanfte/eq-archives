OK - think I have a better understanding.

There is a faction rank and a hate rank.  Aggro is boolean.

As your faction grows, the text changes from Ready To Attack, to Ally. 
If your faction is low enough, Ready-To-Attack or Threatening, and
you're close enough, you will be given a ranking on the hate list.  

If you're alone, the hate rank just needs to be > 0 and you have aggro. 
If you're with another and he has > hate, he has aggro.  Who ever has
the higher hate ranking has aggro.  Some spells are meant to put you on
the top of the hate list (100 I think is the ceiling) and others lower
on the list.  As you do more damage or healing (pissing them off) you're
ranking climbs a little and theirs lowers.  If your hate is > theirs, you
have aggro. 

I'm sure this is over simplifying it but isn't this the jist?
