I can understand your frustration with the lack of testing, or
seemingly lack of testing.  In RL I'm a software tester and it would
appear that Sony does not have a dedicated QA department.  In general,
a lot of development departments feel that a dedicated testing effort
is not needed and takes too much time.  Of course, I don't work for
Verant so I don't know what kind of budget restraints they have or how
many people (if any) they have dedicated to testing.  It would not
surprise me if there are no more than two in house testers.  I think
for the size of the game and all it's complexities they have done a
good job with testing, with the exception of all the updates to Luclin
back when it came out.  However, I think if they had good test
documentation (test plan, regression test cases, ect...) they would
not have missed the problem with Bard instruments not giving bonuses
to bard songs.  With good documentation, the changes would take longer
to implement but patches would be less frequent and they wouldn't have
to have patches to fix the patches.  This is just an opinion of one
person with many years in the software testing/QA field.  This was not
meant to be an attack on anyone nor am I trying to be an apologist for
Verant.
