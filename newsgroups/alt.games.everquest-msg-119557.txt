Howdy all,

  A little while back (can't exactly pinpoint when) there was a patch that
hosed my vision underwater.  I have a decent (not great, decent) system that
runs EQ pretty well, but ever since said patch I can't see much further than
the virtual nose on my virtual face.  It wasn't always this way.  No, I'm
not saying I could see forever before, but now I have a large, ugly gray
clip-plane that makes swimming near the gobbies more than a little tricky.
I've installed various updated drivers that Nvidia released, but still have
the same problem so I'm assuming that it's the game itself.
Has anyone else had this problem?  I'm using 64MB DDR GeForce2 GTS with
latest detonator drivers.

TIA for any advice,
SEAN...
