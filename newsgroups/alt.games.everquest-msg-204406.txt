You shamans and your clicky things.  Growing up, Rak had show boots,
gazughi ring, JBB, poison cure earring, and later epic. I had...snare
earring.  I was sooooo jealous of his clicky prowess.

But now I have three whole clicky things...snare earring, eyepatch, and
floaty cloak.  I feel alittle better about myself. :P

Thank you, sir.  I wanted to make sure I wasn't insane.  I've been
thinking for a while that I'd go defensive instead of archery, and I do
get a lot of ribbing.  Hearing from a shaman's mouth that I'll be viable
even in Teir 2 means that I can follow my heart without being a lost
cause. ;)

What confuses me...is that when folks start saying "nerf archery", a lot
of rangers start showing parse after parse that proves that their archery
rarely outdamages their melee damage.  Saying that it just _looks_ like a
lot of damage, but archery misses and does low-damage far too often (not
to mention trueshot being only 2 minutes), that it isn't as great as it
sounds.  (It used to be that archery was a way to do damage without risk,
but is that slightly changed now with aggro adjustments?)

Yet when I tell other rangers that I don't want to do EQ/AM3 as my first
class AAs, they all urge me to change my mind, because nothing makes a
ranger as powerful.  That archery is the pinnacle of the damage a ranger
can do.

Is anyone else confused now too? O.o
