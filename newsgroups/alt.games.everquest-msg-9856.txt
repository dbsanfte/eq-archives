Some, I'm sitting here looking at some of the screen shots and character
sprites for The Shadows of Luclin. The characters that they show look
amazing. And the article says that the new version of EQ will "sport an
enchanced 3D engine." That is why the characters look so amazing. It says
that it will enhance the existing characters in the game. My question is,
will people who do not perches The Shadows of Luclin be able to freely
upgrade to the new engine, or will they be limited to the old one? I don't
mind the current EQ graphics, I think they are great. I just noticed that
the new engine might even be supporting clothing (ie flapping capes). I
think that would be very impressive. If we could see more detail on our
character from the items we are using. Anyway, is anyone out there really in
the loop on this, can clarify exactly what this upgrade version will do?
Rumors are good too.
