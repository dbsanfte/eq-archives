Humm! Lets see where to start.

Okay! Exaggerating a bit to make the point.

1) I buy EQ start my new character. I arrive in zone to find nothing to 
hunt as the other
level 1 to 2 to 3 to 4 to 5 climbing the levels as I watch in his PoP 
armour and equipment is clearing the zone faster than it can spawn. So I 
dump the game and never come back.

2) As an intermediate player I watch as zones are purged of spawns by 
farmers not just quadding but training the entire zone.

3) Those players who have the gear already become super rich as they now 
farm the good gear to sell. They will always stay a head as long as 
there are expansions or a demand. Then by the time that little jimmy the 
1st level druid is in elemental armour. the entire supply and demand 
will collapse as no one will want to buy. (See tech stocks in the 90's 
to tulip bulbs in the 1700's Create a demand feed it until the bubble 
bursts and move on)

4) The demand for platinum to fuel the spending spree that would result 
would force the game even further into the hands of the exploiters and 
hackers.

As more and more people would need to buy armour to keep up with the 
arms race.

"Not in elemental gear then not in our guild"

Reason, over equipped for their level characters would be taking on 
harder and harder challenges just keep the game fun. Equipment would 
replace tactics. So the puller pulls 8 we can handle it. You would only 
die if your gear wasn't as good as everyone else's so people who never 
want to or had to buy platinum would be forced to buy.

Your 40th level character still in your quested Ivy Etched or Dark 
Forged armours would die in seconds as the rest of the party in their 
elemental plane armour watched.

5) Watching a 1st level warrior in elemental armour hacking at a 30th 
level mob for half an hour as the mob cannot hurt him. But due to the 
lack of skill and damage cap neither can the warrior hurt the mob much. 
Would tire after the first one you saw.

Those are just the starters.

Then there is the problem is EQ is not a real economy because:

1) Nothing wears out or is broken so people never need to buy 
replacements.

2) There are no schools, roads, hospitals or police to pay for.

3) There is no real workforce making items or food to sell as most is 
generated on vendors until higher levels. then most is self made.

This leads to a much larger disposable income as people do not have 
extensive expenses to cover as in real life.

So that given EQ has to regulate it's economy to keep the game playable 
and fun for the majority of players.

Not pander to the few who wish they could get a full set of elemental 
armour without having to work for it <grin>

Now I wonder if the servers are up yet.
