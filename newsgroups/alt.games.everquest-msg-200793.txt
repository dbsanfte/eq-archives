I've hunted with and without Canni levelling my 34 Shaman, and the
difference is pretty small. The only time I "have" to use canni is
when I get a lot of resists or take on a tough mob with a lot of hps.
In group situations where I am the primary healer I will use Canni
more, because I spend most of my time sitting and medding through
constant pulls. Canni is a nice tool. but it is nothing like
Breeze/C1/C2/KEI.

Canni (or the darkpact line for Necros) is part of the class. It
trades HPs for mana. Even with regen the ratio of HPs to Mana is not
great. It is a tool, that helps to extend the mana pool at the cost of
HPs. Nothing more.
