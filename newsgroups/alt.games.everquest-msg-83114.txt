Towertumbler isn't in Everquest's fantasy world, where compound first
names aren't permitted. It was also under "special case" rules in
regards to RL events which needed special care.

"Paganfist" could be read as a religious referrence, and therefore
also isn't "acceptable" in Everquest's fantasy world.
