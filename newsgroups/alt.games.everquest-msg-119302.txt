    I'll speculate. He's a soloist for the most part. Look at the mobs a
solo caster fights. How many need to be debuffed with an Annul-line spell?
Of the ones that do need to be debuffed that way, how many are pulled with
Annul and never have the spell cast on them again?

    A buddy's guild had this done to them with Lodizal. Ranger snares turtle
to bring it back, Snare goes poof in 30 seconds and ranger gets eaten just
as he gets back to group. Shaman Turgurs turtle, then Turgurs drops in 30
seconds and shaman gets eaten. I wish Annul had a significant hate value to
it - then at least the knobs that do this would get eaten before the people
they're trying to victimize.
