I'm starting to work on ring of scale faction in hopes that I will be able
to key to VP.  Are there any mobs that I can easily check faction on?  I
know that everything in SF is ros but they are also on minions of scale
which I am not raising so I think they wont work for a check.  There is one
dragon in WW that I could use, but he wasnt up last I checked.
