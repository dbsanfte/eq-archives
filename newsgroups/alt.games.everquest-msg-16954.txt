}I belive any quest except Epic can be done by a level 1, not that you would
}want to but it can be done. Epic requires you to be a 46

There's a certain amount of myth to that.  I've never completed an epic, 
so perhaps that is true for the final step.  But I have done the first 
couple steps of the Warrior epic... as a 16 Enchanter.  

Note, these were the parts that didn't involve uber-rare drops or things 
that spawn once a fortnight, so I wasn't screwing some warrior out of his 
precious epic.

Why'd I bother?  I was bored.  But in any case, it looks like the 'if you 
have the faction you can do it' rule applies even there.  And level don't 
mean squat. 

Except, perhaps, at the final step.
