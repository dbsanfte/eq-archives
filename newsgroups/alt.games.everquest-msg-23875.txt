I like a good sense of community (it isn't good if nobody knows everyone). Also
for the guild to be fairly large so that I don't know everyone and can still
meet new people while having a lot of previous friends in it. The guild needs
to be high enough level (my current guild is 30+, which is great for me) so
that you don't have a bunch of ignorant newbies begging for power leveling and
items, and you can have nice raids, etc.

>2.  What type of recruitment do you consider most favorable?

I totally hate /shout advertisements. It conveys a sense of cheapness, in my
opinion. The guild that I am in is pretty big, mainly due to the fact any
officer can invite anyone they want (30+ that is). If the person they invite is
an idiot, the idiot gets removed from the guild. Not too many idiots get
invited, though. I like the idea of controlling who you make an officer,
instead of trying to control who you invite. It really helps guilds grow.

>3.  What do you feel is a guilds key to success?

Staying active and being large enough to hold a lot of activities (raids, arena
events etc) without being huge enough to have to split.

>4.  What type of services should a guild offer you the member?

My guild has a recently added guild bank (you have to add something to take
something out, or you can just add something, including plat, and get credits)
which is a great feature. Hand-me-downs are pretty nice. Guild discounts are
also fun, as is PLing.

>5.  What features should the guild offer on their website?

Message board, roster (www.guildmagic.com is great), raid schedule, guild
news...
