Every time I click the agree button I have to chuckle, because the supreme
court of the US has ruled several times on EULAs and ever time they have ruled
against the EULA.  EULAs as currently presented in the United States are NOT
enforceable.  That EULA would have to be presented at the point of purchase, to
be anywhere close to being valid, and now your involving the retailer, in this
and they don't want any part of that liability.   The courts have also ruled on
the copyrights aspects on software, the CD or disk in considered to be a book.
You may copy that book for personal use, loan out that book, give it away, or
sell it to a third party.  You may not however make a copy of the book and then
sell or give those copies away.

"A strong body makes the mind strong. As to the species of exercises, I advise
the gun. While this gives moderate exercise to the body, it gives boldness,
enterprise and independence to the mind. Games played with the ball, and others
of that nature, are too violent for the body and stamp no character on the
mind. Let your gun therefore be your constant companion of your walks."
--Thomas Jefferson
