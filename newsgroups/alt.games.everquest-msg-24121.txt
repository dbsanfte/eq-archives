 Lewts on HGs being... Coinage?  From what I understand the Warrens loot
code doesn't effect coin loot just magic item loot. Although I suppose I
could be wrong about that.

 True, perhaps. However there are three other continents out there that
provide ample opportunity for farmers to twink their characters if they
choose to do so. Which, I suppose,  one can also use to argue in favor
of the new loot rules on new zones.

 I have over 150 levels between three characters. I don't recall the
last item I actually farmed from a green mob. I just don't see "farming"
as that big of a problem. Perhaps that's just my server, who knows.
