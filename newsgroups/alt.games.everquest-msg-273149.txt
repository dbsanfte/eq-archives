Nope, they have not changed it; I forgot to take into account food/water 
when I set up my recently-recreated character in the bazaar, and the 
saltwater tuna he had on him started vanishing slowly....with only the 'You 
are out of water' message coming up. So yes, while in the bazaar, you do 
everything normally when NOT in trader, other than being encumbered (and 
it's a damned good thing at times that encumberance is not an issue in the 
bazaar, as everyone who's stepped OUT of the bazaar with a huge amount of 
plat can testify lol).
