Not being on the progression servers, my SK has never had much trouble
finding a mana regen buff, so I usually pull with a snare/dot such as
Dooming Darkness.  As a result, I've completely neglected my Archery
skill.  And since none of my other characters have Archery at all, I've
realised I have almost no idea how the skill works.  So it's high time
I asked some questions about it. :-)

I see that bows and arrows both have ranges and damage stats.  (They
also both have Delay, but the Delay on arrows seems always to be zero?)
How do those stats work?  I.e., is the range the sum of the two, or the
smaller of the two, or what?  Likewise for the damage.

My tradeskiller got fletching up to 200 at some point (probably for the
shawl quest, but I forget), but I wasn't really paying attention to how
much arrows cost to make, and certainly have no idea what to look for in
an arrow.  (This is, of course, partly because I don't know what the
range and damage stats do. :-)  But I know one of the reasons I've shied
away from archery is because I see folks hawking arrows for, say, 5pp
each, and paying 5pp per bowshot just seems extravagant.  What is a
typical outlay for ammunition if I'm willing to make it myself?

I've used thrown weapons, and for those I've noticed that stuff seems to
jump around in my inventory.  E.g., if I put a stack of thrown weapons
in my range slot, when I throw one some of the rest move over to my ammo
slot, or something like that.  But I think if I have more of the ammo item
in my bags it gets used up automatically as well?  For bows, I'm guessing
I equip the bow in the range slot and the arrows in the ammo slot?  If I do
that, will it automatically find more of the same arrows in my bags?  And
where do quivers fit into all of this?

Thanks for any enlightenment!
