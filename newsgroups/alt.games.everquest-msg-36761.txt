    I disagree about it doing nothing. Other than the chance to screw up
quests, and make portions of the lore of SoL unavailable to be experienced
by everyone, it also turns green aggro into one massive PITA - for everyone.
Example: before, if a snow dervish aggroed me in Velious, I'd kill it on the
off chance it would drop something amusing, like the Frozen Mantle I gave to
my necromancer. Now, I'm training it to whatever zone I'm heading to - not
worth my time to kill. You're coming through that zone? Here's a present.

    If you don't want me to kill mob X, fine - don't have it try to kill me
first.

    If you think a snow dervish is a newbie mob, let one of your two
characters stand beside one for a minute. When I hit level 60 (Brell
willing), then level 44 and lower mobs will be off-limits to me. Even though
the average level 44 mob would either tear me apart or make me empty my mana
bar to kill it. If instead the level limit is 20 levels as I've heard it
might be, then 39 and under is off-limits - that's what, Sonic Bat / Lava
Beetle levels? Again, no slouch and something I'd have to deal with if it
aggroed on me - too bad I don't get anything for the hassle. TRAIN TO ZONE!

    Disagree with them, sure. But piss them off? Why would VI do something
JUST to get high level players angry, when eventually everyone becomes one?
Note that I'm not using the "uber" definition of high level - if you get
over 40, you're high level.

    So I'll never be forced to travel through one of these "low level" zones
by linear design to get to the zones I "belong" in? There will be NO content
in these zones that I cannot discover that reveals the backstory to SoL in
any way, shape, or form? The items coming from these new zones will in no
way, shape or form be better than any equipment I currently posess? How much
would you like to bet that all three of these will be broken in SoL? Given
the content in the Warrens, I can imagine the loot that will drop in a
Droga-level dungeon in SoL - and I can't upgrade myself by going there.

>Luclin low level zones will give NEW players a chance to discover something
>not yet discovered on their server.

    What does it matter what they discover, if there's only a narrow window
in which to go get it? It's empty content - the empty zone that is The
Warrens shows us that. You remember The Warrens - the zone the top guilds
descended on with twinks in tow, and got the spoilers to first? Ah, but the
Warrens Loot Code will be refined for SoL, you say! Then let me ask you
this - tell me how the "New, Improved Warrens Code" can tell the difference
between:

(A) A twink with high-level buffs from a friend, and a legitimate player
that had a high-level cast a "grief buff" on him to force him out.
(B) A mob being snared to help a twink, and a "grief snarer" there to force
out a low-level group so he can move his twink in.
(C) The equipment of a twink, and the equipment of a shrewd trader.
(D) A player getting non-buff aid (eg. heals) from a friend, and a player
getting "grief heals" to move them along?

    These are some of the criteria I've seen that would trigger the new
Warrens code - do you get the picture yet? It will be a customer relations
nightmare trying to separate the well-intentioned from the malevolent -
unless it becomes harassment to buff someone. Won't all the low-levels love
THAT - "I'd buff you, but you could /petition me. Go without, n00b." And if
these triggers aren't in place, then it will be business as usual - the
first people in the new content zones will be PLers who will suck the spawns
dry until their twink is done there.
