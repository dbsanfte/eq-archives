Ahh - that's where me buffs have been going on my baby pally...*slaps
head*...I have female high elf Paladin who get's a shit load of high level
drive by buffs funnily enough...

I am starting to wonder what killed me then. I definately zoned into Nexus
as I saw the Half Elf chick next to the bazaar entrance (where I am bound),
but died almost immediatly and assumed it was the lich because as I hadn't
remembered to turn it off. I right away got the you have died and loading
message,  a wait, to end up in the same spot, my corpse beneath me.

The Lightbringer is psuedo Ceric/Paladin class (tough bugger, dark blue but
takes all my mana most of the time) as well, so shouldn't have been using
any DoT's either. The Spiroc Warrior is Shaman but I would have noticed him
had he entered the fray. Not even with the amazing ineptitude of the Chimp
has a self DoT being achieved yet either.

*scratches head*

Maybe a tad less beer this weekend methinks..... but even beer courage won't
make me stay in a zone with multiple feared mobs on the prowl, good time to
embrace my cowardly side methinks : )
