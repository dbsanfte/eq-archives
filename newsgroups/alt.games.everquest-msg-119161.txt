Humm,

What I mean is that knowledge of and from books generally translates
better for most people. EQ stories and knowledge are great when talking
to EQ or general gaming people but book knowledge is good for most
people, or at least most people that I would want to be friends with.

I was agreing that it is easier to make friends in EQ, but the knowledge
from books is a more likely route to keeping good friends longer.

Just a light hearted comment, not sure how your dead parents and school
friends got in there. (are all you high school chums dead ?)

Jim
