I rarely undercut, but I will price-match.  Declining prices hurt everyone.

What I do is look to see what other people are selling for.

If there's one person priced at, say, 100pp, and five others at 150pp, I'll
price at 150.

But if one guy has 20 of them at 100pp, chances are nobody will be paying
more than 100pp, so I'll match.

If I have something up at the same price as everyone else, and it's not
selling after a week or two, then I'll start undercutting.  I may not get as
much money off that item, but I can then use that inventory slot to sell
something else.
