The newb armor quest in halas is for leather armor, which isn't very
effective for a tank.
Need something with a little more ac. I don't now of any weapon quests
there. Me
and my roommate both scored shiny brass sheilds from the trainer in cb. He
dropped it 2 times in a row which was cool. But thats it for magic weapon.
It's
funny to watch us fight wisps or ghouls. He stands back and casts (he's
shaman)
and I stand there and bash them every couple seconds with my shield. Just
wondering
if theres any other good warrior quests for my level. I've checked everlore
for
the zones I've been in but haven't seen anything yet...
