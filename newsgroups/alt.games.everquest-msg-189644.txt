If you want to play around with that, before dedicating a box, and without
the annoyance of repartitioning to install Linux, check out www.knoppix.com.
Knoppix is a Linux distribution that comes on, and runs off of, a bootable
CD.  They use a compressed file system, and have squeezed a couple of gigs
onto it.  It has almost everything that a typical Linux distribution has in
a normal install.  E.g., KDE, Gimp, OpenOffice, most of the development
tools, etc.

Knoppix is also very useful for diagnosing network problems, since it has
all the normal Linux network monitoring and diagnostic software.  In fact,
this might be useful to figure out your router problem.  Get a cheap hub
(must be a hub, *NOT* a switch), and hook things up like this:

    cable ------ hub ------- router +---- EQ computer
    modem         |                 |
              Linux box             +... other computers

You can then peek at the communications between the router and Sony, and see
if you can tell what is going wrong.  (If the Linux box has two NICs, you
can also hook it to the switch on the router, and monitor everything)

Make sure the router isn't overheating.  I don't keep my apartment super hot
or anything like that...but the way things are arranged, it turns out the
computer area is quite a bit hotter than the rest, and it was enough to make
routers that are speced to 40C to overheat.  I had to switch to one rated to
55C to cure my problems.  It's not likely you've got a heat problem, but
check just to be sure.  (Simple way to check would be to set a house fan to
blow over the router, and see if the problem diminishes or goes away).
