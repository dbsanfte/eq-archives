You can save yourself a lot of grief by deleting your Paladin
and creating a toon of one of the few favored classes.  SOE
has announced that the Knight classes are to be ass-fucked with
rusty halberds on a routine basis from now on.  If you want to
tank, make a Warrior.  If you want to heal, make a Cleric.  If
you want to pull, make a Bard.  If you want to hurt things, make
a Wizard, Rogue, or Necromancer.  If you desire meaningful
"utility" make an Enchanter.  Do not, I repeat, do not imagine
that a Paladin, Shadowknight, or Shaman will add any real value
to a group facing challenging content.
