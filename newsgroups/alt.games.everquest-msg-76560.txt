I'd phrase that as "will try to convert it back".  If the NTFS
partitions has any clusters marked as bad, you'll have to use a disk
editor to first mark the clusters as good, repair and reboot.  Then,
maybe PM will deign to convert it.

Remember that in Shakespeare, Falstaff was described as "robust".  He
was a big, fat smelly pig.  

I've come around in recent months, and I would argue I've been a user
of Windows NT architecture OSes longer than anyone here ... 1992.
Pre-release.  Until Windows 2000, I kept my systems in dual boot: A
Win9x partition for EQ, and a Win NT partition in NTFS for "work".

Recently, I've been doing drive throughput tests ... and the numbers
are very disillusioning.  Converting my secondary partition to FAT32
(60 GB drive) quadruples the throughput over NTFS.
