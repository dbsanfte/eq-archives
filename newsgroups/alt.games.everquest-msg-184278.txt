Great to hear you are back up and running :-)

Most of the "advanced " settings will slow down performance, but make
the game look better. It is a trade-off.

One way to research the settings would be to go to
http://groups.google.com and search. For instance, you could type in
"what is anti-aliasing" and skim through the threads/posts.

Here is a quick rundown on the common settings for the GF4 that have a
noticable effect in EQ.

Anti-Aliasing: In a nutshell AA is used to smooth the sharp jagged
edges on objects that are drawn in a 3D game. There are different ways
of doing this, and it can get pretty technical. Basically more video
card memory and processing is used to blend the jagged edges and
smooth things out. Often this can result in blurred text, and a pretty
hefty performance hit..

Anisotropic Filtering: This setting helps to reduce texture "shimmer"
and "crawling". It's hard to describe, but if you have ever run
through East Commonlands and looked at the grass textures ahead of
you, you will know what I'm describing.

Texture Sharpening: This settings seems to improve things a bit in 3d
games without much of a performance hit. Graphics appear sharper and
less fuzzy....Well duh...heheheh

If you are running the 4x.xx drivers for your Nvidia card, I would
recommend the following settings.....

Performance: Aggressive
Anti-Aliasing: OFF (too much of a performance hit, for very little
gain)
Anisotropic Filtering: The first notch to the right of OFF. (If memory
serves this is 2x Aniso, and does a nice job of cleaning up textures)
Texture Sharpening: Checked (it is a check box under the Aniso and AA
settings)
