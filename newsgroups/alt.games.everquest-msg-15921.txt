Have been lurking for a while, and feel the need to jump in here.  If
it isn't something that you'd "get riled up about", why did you post
in the first place?  What a moron!!!

I seem to recall that he/she told you to email him/her to continue the
arguement.  In case you're a little to thick to figure out the
spam-blocker, the email is Crash86_eq@hotmail.com.  Have you emailed? 
No, I doubt you have.

Looks to me like Crash provided you with another thing to think about
and you got all pissy about it.  When you snapped, he/she decided that
you weren't worth the hassle.

So what?  I don't recall anyone asking you for your opinion.  You
posted it for the world to see and respond to.  Probably the truth is
this: you never knew either "version", and got in a wad when someone
corrected you.

Again, if it matters so little to you then why do you continue to post
about it?  Several others have posted and you haven't seen Crash back
here, though I have seen him/her posting in other threads.  Hell, I
think I saw where Crash posted in a thread AGREEING with you.  Looks
to me like when he/she said that they were killing the damn thread,
that's EXACTLY what he/she did.  You, on the other hand, didn't decide
to jump back in until other people started saying the same thing Crash
was saying.  Does someone disagreeing with you make you feel that
inferior?  If so, seek a psych.

Go away, child.
