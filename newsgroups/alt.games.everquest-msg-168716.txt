Posting in HTML is rude in this community. If you want to do that, go
to yahoogrups and form a mailing list. When you post HTML many people
get gibberish followed by (often) uninteresting text.

The real comment is that support requests belong at everquest.com, not
here. This should be either the forum of last resort for bugs that may
be "Interesting", or how to play the game better.

If you can't get /face working, that is a simple support question. If
you want to complain that some characters only get a few face picks,
or that the ogre female model doesn't have enough makeup on, or that
you can make a face that looks like Erroll Flynn again, that would be
a great post.
