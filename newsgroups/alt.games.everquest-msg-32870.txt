First if you are a pet class or cappable of charming something like a Snow
Bunny take your pet to the top of the ramp to Keal. Have the /pet guard
here, the pet will face the trigger trap. follow the direction the pet is
faceing repeat untill trap is triggered. You will either get the dwarf or
the death squad so be ready to run.
Second Method very slow and hard to use,  find a good spot with a view of
the area, and take an item to trade (be sure fast drop is off) strat
clicking the item aroud the screen untill you get the message you are too
far to make the trade. That is the spot. Again this can be Dwarf or Death
Squad.
