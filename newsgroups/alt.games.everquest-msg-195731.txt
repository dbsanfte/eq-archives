That's why I think porting to PoAir and PoFear is too harsh.  Sure, it's a
great way to punish people who are exploiting, but it catches a fair number
of innocents as well - like people who are simply arriving late and want to
come and help.

I'm all for porting out folks based on the z-axis, but wish it would be
something much more innocuous, like somewhere in PoTranq.  I'm guessing
we'll see exactly that kind of change in the next patch or two.
