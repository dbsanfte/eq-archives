I don't think it had little effect on people playing monks, I think it 
had little effect on monk's pulling ability for exp groups.

I agree that the nerf was outrageous and largely uncalled for; to any 
extent it -was- called for, it was hitting something with a 10 lb 
sledgehammer that needed a nudge with a nice 12 oz ball peen.

No, here I have to disagree.  I played two seperate clerics back in the 
day, and in the kunark/velious era, monks were hands down my favorite 
tanks till we got up into the mid to high 50s.  Why?  Because their HP 
bars dropped at the same rate (percentage wise) as that of warriors, but 
their bars represented half the HP.  This meant that a Superior Heal did 
twice as much healing on them as it did on warriors.

As a cleric, eventually this stopped being interesting as I ended up 
using CHeal for just about everything, and CHeal was 10k hp, more than 
any warrior ever had, so it didnt' matter if the 80% damaged monk had 
only 2000 hp to heal and the 80% damaged warrior had 4000 hp to heal; 
both were costing me the same mana.

But it was pretty obvious to me that for druids and shaman, that a monk 
would continue to be a better MT; no Cheal (long before the introduction 
of Incomplete heals), plus their regen would be twice as useful as well.

Then you have to consider buffs.  Add a Heroism and Symbol to a warrior, 
you make a little bonus room.  But add the same spells to a monk, you 
get twice as much out of them, because his base HP are so much lower.

SImilarly, AC did nothing at all for warriors; their AC was already 
outside the box where it had an effect, monk AC, though, was often 
pushing up into that line; an AC boost could really change the numbers 
for them.

The reason, IMO, that these things were true is that monks were given 
relatively poor AC, leather stuff, given some AC for not wearing or 
carrying heavy gear, to add to that, and then given nice mitigation 
skills to help out further.  But with more and more all all gear that 
would actually be nice on warriors, and light weight, monk's base AC 
went up thru the roof (compared to what it would have been if they'd 
stuck to just leathers) yet they kept their weight based AC -and- their 
nice mitigation.

It didn't take 1500AC to have this effect, AC of 1000 or 1100 was pretty 
close to the top of what made any difference anyway, over that on a 
warrior was just "flash", but didn't really change the damage they took. 
  Pre POP, remember, mob attack values just weren't all that high.

Again, its not a nerf to have other classes get good weapons.  A nerf 
would be if monks weapons were all degraded somehow.  But they weren't 
changed, its just that other classes got even -more- fabulous weaponry, 
so in comparison it looked like they changed.  Give a monk today the 
same weaponry and buffs and gear that he had two years ago, put him up 
against the same Velious era mob, and he'd do the same damage.  With the 
new buffs that are available now, he'd do -more- damage.  But he'd still 
lose because he can't take the damage the way he could then.

I think that would be a simple solution... or at least a good start.  I 
think with the itemization that other classes have now, you still 
wouldn't see monks back in the preeminant position they had back in the 
day... but it would at least be a good start at restoring some dignity 
to the class.

Splendid One, 57 gnomage, Firiona Vie (current main, not too relevant to 
this)
Bergh, 65 cleric Morel Thule, semi retired
Praise, 49 cleric, Luclin, long since retired (but dating from pre 
kunark to early Velious)
Paax, 52 shaman, Morell Thule (never had access to pre nerf monk, but 
can imagine from my cleric experience)
