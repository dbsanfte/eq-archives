There seems to be a new scam going, a female woodelf Druid sitting
next to the newbie lift looking dejected and with no gear. 
I died says she!.  Gave her a tunic AC6, trousers AC5 and a cracked
staff. There you go say I, better luck!.
Came back later she was again sitting, no gear, and again later on.

Could she be selling the stuff I ask myself! :-)))

Made a mistake there, spent a lot on leather gear for mr Druid and arrived
at level 9 with only enough money for three spells.

If I have any criticism of EverQuest it is the sudden jump in price
of spelss between level 5 and 9. As you say money is still very tight
then and I have`nt found any way to make much yet.
