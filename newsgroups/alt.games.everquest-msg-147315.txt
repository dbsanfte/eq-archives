Uh, no.

I thoroughly tested it a while back, and you do not meditate on a
horse while traveling.  As far as I know that has never been the case.

The good news is that you're meditating on a horse every instant
unless:
   1.  You're traveling, or
   2.  Your autoattack is on.

It's amazing how much of a difference this makes, even compared
to being extremely diligent about sitting your butt down every
free moment.

Plus, the "med-on-a-horse" doesn't generate "sitting aggro",
so you can do it in the middle of a bunch of mobs without
getting interrupted.  Not only is this handy during fights
(you can even go into the spellbook and mem a new spell without
getting undue aggro), it's also nice in places like WC where
every Bear's mission seems to be to smack high-level folks
who are sitting trying to meditate.
