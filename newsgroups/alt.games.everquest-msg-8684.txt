You can report it and that's ok, but don't expect anything to come of it
right away.  Just because something is against your rules of ethical
behavior (and rules of ethics *are* subjective) doesn't make it against any
terms of service.  However should that person at any time in the future
resort to actual violence, having this on his record could be used as
evidence against him.
