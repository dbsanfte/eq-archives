Just an aside.  I am a Necro that is very much KOS in Halas
and have gone invis past guards there hundreds of times
(used to do the bear pelt quest and Orc wrist bands quest
invis too).  None have ever seen through invis.  No guard in
any town I have been in has seen me through invis to date.
I am level 44 at present.  The problem is invis is not a
sure thing when it comes to elapse time of spell.  Can last
a few seconds or up to 30 minutes I think.
