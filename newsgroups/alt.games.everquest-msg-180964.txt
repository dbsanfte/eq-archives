If you have a grunty PC it makes no huge real difference to
performance - I've tried one and two installs with windowed mode and
EQW and all my problems are down to my rubbish connection not being
able to handle both characters at once. 

I wasn't very happy as I thought 2 directories would improve things
but it hasn't.    Believe me I've read everything on the EQW Forums
to try and improve things: 2 installs, sound off, etc etc.

It has worked since they put windowed mode in - switching between
sessions is a lot more clunky than EQW and you get the "black screen"
effect every swap but it's fairly stable all the same.  Don't do it
on the character select screen either.
