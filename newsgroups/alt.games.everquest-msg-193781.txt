Not really up on Ranger equipment, not played my own in a while and some 12
levels off of yours :ï¿½)
My suggestions  would be;

Drop the Ice Forge Shackels (I know you are probably emotionally scarred
from killing so many flying monkeys)
Replace with either another SC Wristband, Dragon Hero Bracer (for dis/pois
and MR) or, if you can get a raid going in UP the Dark Assassin and Dark
Masters bracers are good, Dark Masters BP would also be right up your street
if you could get it.

Boots and Gaunts both low in AC, would suggest Crystal Chitin as an easy
upgrade, can make back some Dex and Stamina by dropping Griffon Claw Earing
and replacing with Vah Shir Claw.

Shoulders could also be better, Imbued Granite for AC and resists or
Tunarean Scout Mantle (I am assuming you are not Halfling) would give better
AC with HP and Dex.
