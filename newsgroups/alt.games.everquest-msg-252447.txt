Actualy, yes, the homeless person is technically commiting theft, in many 
jurisdictions.  This is why some people lock their dumpsters, especially 
the ones with recycleables in them.  This also relates to the occasional 
books you find with the covers ripped off to 'destroy them' at garage 
sales...

}None of this has any bearing on this case.

Agreed.  But fuckall that we say here does. :)
