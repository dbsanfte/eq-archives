It's like this:

The Drachnids do NOT natively see invis.  However, some of the driders---er
drachnids---are casters which have "See Invisibility" and will cast it as
one of their buffs.  They cast this on themselves... and their bretheren
will occassionally ask for it.

The result is drachnids which intermittantly see invis.
