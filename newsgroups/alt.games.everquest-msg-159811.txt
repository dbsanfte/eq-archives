You supplied the number, not me.

Must be some new usage of the term "astronomical" of which I was
previously unaware.

Guides are unpaid volunteers, and thus fluctuations in their
population do not reflect on the resources being allocated to the game
by Sony.

This sentence is completely at odds with your entire premise. If the
game is requiring "continuous mandatory upgrading", the only reason
for that would be that Sony is making changes to the game. Ergo, they
are not actively in the process of abandoning it. Even your own
arguments are self-defeating. Do you see now why some of us consider
you an idiot?

I've been hearing that for three years now. And for those three years,
EQ remains wildly popular - enough so that Sony has invested in
producing EQ2.

If every unwashed moron who has made the same claims as you have has
been right, then the answer is "at least three years, so far".

They opened that door by default when they showed that subscription
based online gaming could be hugely successful. Competition is a good
thing. But again, that's just Business 101, and doesn't do anything to
support your claim of laziness.

No, I didn't wonder - I recognized that you were blowing smoke. And
further, you stated "1 or 2 hours", not five. That discrepancy alone
is enough to demonstrate that you're making it up as you go.
