It's my belief that instancing actually makes for a MORE immersive
world. Frankly, for me, it damages the immersive-ness of a world to
have dozens of adventurers running around in every cave full of
monsters and such. We're heroes in the making, we shouldn't be so
common that we're tripping over each other in ever dungeon. Heroes
should be a rare breed. It makes the world seem bigger and the
experience feel more real when you and your companions are the facing
the dungeon alone. The danger feels greater when you're cut off from
the outside world to such a degree. And instanced dungeons generally
don't respawn, which is another aid to immersiveness.
