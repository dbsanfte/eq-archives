No. Godwin's law just says the longer a thread goes the more likely it
is to contain a Nazi/Hitler reference. The idea that that somehow
"ends" a thread, or threads are "won" because of it is something
frequently quoted by people who don't actually know what he said. It
is noted, however, that once that happens the odds of quality material
coming from that thread drops significantly.

Besides, Godwin was a wuss.

As for dictionary quotes, they are quite useful when someone accuses
you of not knowing what a word meant, which is what happened here.

"Bad enough when the dead come walking," he said to Jon as they crossed
 the village, "now the Old Bear wants them talking as well? No good will
 come of *that*, I'll warrant. And who's to say the bones wouldn't lie?
 Why should death make a man truthful, or even clever? The dead are likely
 dull fellows, full of tedious complaints - 'the ground's too cold, my
 gravestone should be larger, why does *he* get more worms than I do....'"
