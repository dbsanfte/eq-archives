This is certainly more common than I ever expected.  I appreciate everyone's
candor.  This is my first guild, I've only been in it a few months, and only
attended a few raids.  Now I understand why there are some *players* that
aren't very communicative, they probably aren't even there.  

>All that said, a few basic things can be done to make it easier:
>1.  Always have the bot and main in the same group.

AGREED!!

>Now, if they demonstrably can't run 2 characters without a huge loss
>in their ability to run them, they need to not run them. 

DOUBLE AGREED!!  I would have preferred this guy not even pretend that his bot
was a *useful member of the group*.  What a farce....
