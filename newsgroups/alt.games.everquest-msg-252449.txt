People also lock their dumpsters to prevent the mess if 
someone/something goes into them, and above all to keep others from 
putting garbage into them, and thus increase their costs of getting them 
emptied, a major problem in some places.

I don't think there is a huge concern about actually preventing people 
from having your garbage, in the vast majority of locked dumpsters.
