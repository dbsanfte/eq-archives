I servermoved to Venril Sathir, and found, really, that the game
wasnt any different and I merely knew fewer people. So I quit altogether
and took up EQ2 part time with my girlfriend, where I have gone from
being a proud high end raider full of loot and goodies to a rather more
entertained level 24 druid with very little other than a propensity for
getting into trouble. Eats less of my life too ;)

Still. I miss EQ1 occasionally, and ponder about bring Suiddaru back
on VS or Suineko on what is now Prexus. Ho hum ;)
