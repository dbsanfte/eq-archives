You're complaining about a spell that hasn't
been modified from its initial state after
being copied from Garrison's.  

As far as druids nuking boss mobs, they
have the same problem mages do - No way
to dump aggro.  In straight nuke dps
wizards do almost 2x what a druid or mage
can because of concussion.

Of course, if you had a fucking clue, you'd
know that.
