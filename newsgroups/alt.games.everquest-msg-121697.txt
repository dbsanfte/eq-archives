Uhm...ShowEQ doesn't let them know that Ragefire is *about* to pop.  If they
are really showing up consistently just before he pops, then it means they
have figured out the timing (I thought Verant added a random component to
it, but maybe that is broken?).

It's possible that there is something in the zone that triggers Ragefire, or
indicates that Ragefire will pop soon, and that they figured that out by
analyzing spawn data from ShowEQ.  That would be the only way ShowEQ could
possibly be helping them get there before Ragefire pops.
