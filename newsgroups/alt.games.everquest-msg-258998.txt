Heh, heh, recently while conducting a search for some old WH40 games, I saw
parts of both of those boxes drifting around my "game closet."  I should
search the closet for all the parts and reassemble those boxes.  My next
gaming project!  Or maybe I should just clean the closet....nah, won't be
doing that. :)

Maybe we should have a contest over who's got the best collection of old
games in original retail boxes.  For example, to name but a few that come to
mind, I've got MOM, MOO, X-Com, all the original WC's with expansions and
speech packs, SWOTL and all expansions, Kilrathi Saga, all XW/TF and
expansions, WC3 Collectors's Edition (in the can).  How 'bout rare and
obscure games, i.e. Parkan, Hardwar, Anachronox (not really that obscure or
rare, but a great game), etc.

Some day these bloody games in original packaging are going to be just as
collectible as comic books (Yes, in my time, I've owned the first issue of
Mad comics, first issue of the later Mad magazine, first issue of Scrooge
McDuck, first issue of Spider Man.....all lost or thrown away long before
they became valuable.  Now, if I can just live to be a couple of hundred
years old, I'll cash in on my games).
