Be afraid, be very afraid - it's one of those 'really crappy
British/Euro ISPs' that Verant are dealing with for colocating a Euro
server, so a little birdie tells me - Telewest aka Cableinet/Blueyonder.
This was from a guy claiming to be a beta-tester for Telewest's gaming
servers. No idea if it panned out and they actually *are* going with
Telewest. I suppose it could be worse, it could be BT.

I agree with an earlier poster though - no way I'm moving unless they do
a server split. Transferring by paying lots of dough for character
transfers and then showing up naked (and waiting 3 months or whatever
for them to stop designated it a 'new server' and preventing transfers),
doesn't sound like much fun, and neither does starting over.

Everyone /feedback - We want a server split!
