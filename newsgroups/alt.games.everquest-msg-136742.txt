Personally I would love to see it used every day forcing the 
it's change which would also result in the change to the 
amending formula which totally screws the west.

What is this obsession you have with thinking you were called 
a liar ?

Provincial courts frequently make rulings as you suggest above.
The issue is not that they make rulings, the issue is how valid
the rulings are and the realization that they are all subject to 
a higher court. Ontario's decision as I stated before, means jack
because there was never a doubt it would be appealed to the SCC.

Again your focus is narrow and you fail to recognize any change as
proposed affects _everyone_ in this country. But even removing same
sex marriages from the discussion, you don't realize why non elected 
judges usurping the supremacy of Parliament is a bad thing ?

Watch out. Your class is showing again. Whether you like it or not, 
Canada is not your personal hovel where you decide what does or 
doesn't concern others. It must drive you around the bend that
others opposed to your pov might have some input.

Ya I do disagree with it. Because it's my fucking country too, and 
every piece of legislation is my business---every Canadian's
business.

You really are a whacko. In all seriousness, do you have learning 
or reading disability ? If not try and read this slowly, there is a
difference between acknowledging some entity has the power to 
do something, realizing it's inevitable given the makeup of those 
with the power, and approving the decision or agreeing with the 
process. So as you no doubt guessed, the call won't be going out 
in the near future.
