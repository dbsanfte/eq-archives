The cleric epic is still so much harder than the rogue epic that having
it "gimped" from it's original form still doesn't make it gimp. I got my
rogue epic pretty well finished for my alt in less than 12 hours game
time, I spent more than that just farming the pearl shards for the
cleric epic. Even though I lucked out and had the kedge robe drop in the
general fight, I already had one lined up for MQ as they are much more
common than the staff wizzys need for their epic so they're no longer a
bottleneck. Nothing in the rogue epic compares to the chardok queen even
in difficulty, regardless of whether you have a non kos mage coh the
party down to get it or fight there.
