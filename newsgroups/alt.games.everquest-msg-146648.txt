"Do what you will", also covers doing nothing at
all, and is also under the caveat "An ye harm
none"


This is taken from;
http://www.angelfire.com/fl/thetruthaboutwicca/therede.html

"An it harm none...." 

By what standard is harm measured? Who defines
harm? Take a step into the rediculous, and look at
this example: if I, as a believer, were to decide
that it would be a joyous experience to smash my
friend in the head with a sledgehammer, and could
not see any damage, I would be perfectly justified
if I did not intend to harm my friend. My friendï¿½s
concept of harm is not considered. Remember, I am
free to do what I will. Obviously, this is an
unworkable and ludicrous philisophical ideal. The
rights of others can in no way be clearly defined
by the concept of the Rede. 

The flip side of the paradox is found in a more
literal interpretation. If you are a witch, then
honestly answer these questions: 

1. Does the Rede allow for the killing of animals?

2. Does it allow for the killing of plants? 

3. Does "none" include yourself? 

The standard answer for a Wiccan is that suicide
is harmful to one's self and cannot be done. If a
Wiccan cannot harm himself, he cannot kill
himself. The same law applies to animals and
plants - they cannot be harmed. All synthetic
foods are originally made from real food sources.
So what could a believer eat? The Wiccan who
follows this law is faced with a dilemma: eat, and
violate the law, or do not eat, and violate the
law. "


I prefer the original Thelemic law from which this
rede was taken;
"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law"
