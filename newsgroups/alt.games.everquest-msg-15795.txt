You cannot safely camp the tower, the lower room will always aggro when it
spawns you just have to time it and prepare for it. Extra adds come from the
lower room scrambling past wanderers and the pathing stinks so can often
bring a freight train of death. It is not so bad camping the tower if
another group is killing on the floor below but if your group is in there on
its own you have to fight for it. Get yourself an Enchanter to control some
of the adds
