Lord, tell me about it.  I was going through poisons the other day 
proving to someone that if they were a bit easier/cheaper to make a 
rogue could (gimpishly) fear kite :) (buy sow potion, apply snare 
poison, run away, apply fear poison, backstab and cackle with glee - 
problem being of course, how long does the snare last... would be 
difficult to get another snare poison applied even with sow, I'd think).

I never even thought about 10-doses though. That'd be a great idea.
