Yeah kinda like how the slowing economy and plans to destroy the WTC
were in place when Clinton left office.

It was Clinton who decided to try to capture Atta using a small number
of special forces rather than with a full-scale invasion.

And one man alone (Clinton) without the consent of the UN, decided to
attack Serbia.  My oh my how a President's domestic political
viewpoints can alter his perception as a unilaterlist...

Europe should have stopped Hitler too.  It should stop Hussein now. 
(Iran and N Korea are next).

Both massacred thousands of people.  Both acted in opposition to the
UN.  Somehow, because Milosevic killed people for their ethnicity (but
Hussein didn't when he only target Kurds), his slaughter was more evil
than Hussein's.

Yeah it's ok to unilaterally bomb them, killing cilivians and
destroying infrastructure.  But god forbid you invade and actually
acheive something with your unilateral actions...
