It used to be (I think) eqnews.txt.  SOME txt file for sure.  I was looking
for it yesterday seeing if that's where I read about the down time (I've
seen it from other sources as well, that's why I couldn't remember).

I opened all the txt files and none of them had the info I was looking for.
I had to activate the patcher and navigate the crappy little window with the
bending scroll bar (grr) to read the 3-word-per-line patch screen message
(previously a duplicate of the News button inside the game).

Anyway, hopefully someone knows what I mean.  Is it somewhere else
accessible to me so that I can open it in a friendlier reader?

Thanks!
