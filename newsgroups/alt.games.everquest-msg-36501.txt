There can be only one, everquestsdabest@aol.com (EverQuestsDaBest):

Twice as tall as Sand Giants? I think youre out of your gourd.
Although it would be amusing to see. 

Id rather see races existant within the game become playable. Frogloks
particularly. Insert two cities - one for Lower Guk, home of Froglok
Necros and one in Upper Guk, home of the Froglok Paladins.  Frogloks
who start in Lower Guk are obviously evil, and they get that cool
Undead Froglok skin, whereas Upper Guk Frogloks are the good guys.

Id say give them access to all classess except Shaman and Druid, and
youre set. Froglok Monks would be a hoot.

Or how about Gnolls? I wouldnt mind playing Gnolls. Id be tempted to
limit them to Shamans, Druids and Warriors though. Oh, and
Beastmasters eventually.

Orcs would be fun to play. Set them up in Everfrost, far opposite
Halas. Orcs could be a fun race to play.

I mean, we all know that statistics are useless in the game. So Verant
should just let us choose any race we want, set up some basic factions
and let people go to town. I want my damn Froglok Paladin! I want my
Froglok Necro! I want my Froglok Monk leaping around the place doing
spinning kicks and so!
