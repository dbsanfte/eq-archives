In the case of walking around naked...it is against the law in most
places; subject to fines and/or arrest. 

The path of least resistance is almost always taken as a rule. So
anything that "society" can agree upon generally becomes the rule.
Most people spend all of their lives conforming and trying to "fit
in". 

It is much easier (and readily accepted) to look down upon the words
that "society" dictates are vulgar, than to raise a voice questioning
why such words are vulgar in the first place.

The people that commonly use "foul language" are just as guilty as
those that allow themselves to be offended by it. One group gets a
thrill out of doing something "naughty", and the other gets a feeling
of self-righteousness (sp) when they become offended by it. These
feellings occurs at a subconcious level for the most part, and niether
group realizes that they are part of the great flock of sheep that
makes up "society". Both perpetuating the age old game.

I am part of the "flock" as well, and do not waste time deluding
myself into thinking otherwise.
