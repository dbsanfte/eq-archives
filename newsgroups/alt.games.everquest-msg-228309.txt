Warriors cry the loudest, they have some issues, but in all honestley I dont
mind / care if a GOOD warrior tanks in place of a knight.

A good warrior meaning they know what aggro is, they know how to taunt, they
are not obsessed with doing 'teh big damage'.

Ignorance of the general playerbase is the main problem, oh and warriors
complaining each day doesnt add to there desireability (spelling suks :P )
of groups.

Warriors do as much / more melee damage as a ranger, when not tanking, yep,
they suck alright.

To put it another way, having a warrior tank has never slowed down exp for
me over having a paladin tank, just takes a little more skill /effort from
the group, which is the major lacking factor in (pickup) groups these days,
IMO.
