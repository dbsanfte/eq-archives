Nope, too expensive for my level.

When and if I reach a level where they're reasonably affordable,
I'll happily use them.

I'd say it's more likely the camping system drives people away
from the game.  In fact, it probably drives mostly the casual
gamers away -- those people on which SOE makes the most profit.
(Since they don't play much but still pay $13/month.)

You can make things difficult to obtain -- thus, keeping players
playing and striving to improve -- without a camping system.

: You define nice as in rare or uncommon and not by application.

Not at all.  Some nice equipment is easy to obtain and some nice
equipment is hard to obtain.

: you *need* is obtainable, you just want stuff based on status not 
: application.

Not true.

: "Foaming at the bit" is horse talk, sorry.

I've heard the phrase "foaming at the mouth" and also the phrase
"chomping at the bit" but I've never heard "foaming at the bit"
before.

I'm willing to bet 99% of the people that frequent this newsgroup
would like some EQ items they currently don't have.

By your definition, *everyone* is "foaming at the bit".  Perhaps
that DOES fit every EQ player.  *shrug*

It's not bad that people want better things.  As you point out,
it keeps people playing.  They like it and don't know it.  My
point is strictly that the camping system is not the best way
to achieve that result.

: No, I'm spewing the facts.  If it's obtainable it's not good enough for

Many items in EQ are not reasonably obtainable by casual gamers.
There are some items you can get by putting in two 12+ hour blocks
of time that you can't get by putting in tweleve 2+ hour blocks of
time.  I think that's a bad thing, but I could be wrong.

: the system has you exactly where you want to be you just don't know 
: it.  The things that you *need* you have, it's the things that you *want* 
: that are what keep you  playing.

I suspect the game can be modified to achieve the same result
without requiring huge unbroken chunks of time.  I could be wrong.
But it seems to me any quest that requires a 12+ hour camp probably
should be broken up into sub-quests that end up taking the same
amount of time and thus can be done by casual gamers.

: Oh Ed, I'm no troll, I'm just helping you understand the simple fact that 
: you love camping and you don't even know it.  It's a foprst for the tree's 
: kind of thing, Ed.

Alright, I take back the troll comment and apologize.

However, I still think EQ can promote that desire to improve and
get better equipment (thus causing happy players who keep playing)
without requiring huge unbroken chunks of time.
