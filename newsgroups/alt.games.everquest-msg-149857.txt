Nonsense.  I've grouped for a mage for 54 levels with my cleric
and never have seen a mob go past another caster to get to her.

Sitting lowers your effective level for purposes of determing
aggro.  The idea that a mage who isn't on a mob's hate list for
other reasons gets special treatment in the aggro code over
anyone else sitting that's closer is just silly.

Yeah, just like any other caster.

Enchanter gets heals, main tank gets heals, cleric gets heals,
puller gets heals, everyone else gets heals when possible.
