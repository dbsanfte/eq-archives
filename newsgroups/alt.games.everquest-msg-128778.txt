The official Roman Catholic belief is that Tradition and the Bible are of
equal authority, and that the Church heirarchy (particularly the Pope) has
authority over both.

It's why they burned Protestants at the stake so often during the
Reformation and mounted military campaigns to try to wipe them out.... the
idea that the Bible has authority over the church threatened the heirarchy's
power over the people (and the monetary profits that brought.)

But to answer the question, in the United States, the New American Bible is
the most readable and up to date Catholic approved Bible (not to be confused
with the New American Standard, which is a Protestant translation.)  Other
Roman Catholic translations include the Jerusalem Bible (more of a
poetical/free translation) and the Rheims-Douay translation (older
traditional)

  Their statement of faith is aptly summed up in the 'Catechism of the
Catholic Church' published in recent years by Image/Doubleday.

You'd also want to reference the list of doctrines laid down in the Council
of Trent....that is where much of what we know nowadays as Roman Catholicism
was set in stone, so to speak.  http://history.hanover.edu/early/trent.htm
and http://www.forerunner.com/chalcedon/X0020_15._Council_of_Trent.html
as just two examples where you can find references to it.
