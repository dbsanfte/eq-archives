That's a good summation. Didn't occur to me earlier but I think you hit on 
the very reason I forgot to mention HO's in my attempt at a detailed 
description of the combat model. It doesn't feel like part of combat, it is 
indeed a mini-game within combat. It does however provide another basis for 
distinguishing skilled *players* from other players and in that sense Ken is 
right.

I try usually to respond to a pending HO so that we can get whatever benefit 
we can from successful completion, but often it just doesn't make sense. For 
example, if a Priest hammer icon appears this means that I have to cast a 
Smite in order to advance the wheel. I may not *want* to cast a Smite and it 
may be bad tactics to use my precious Power on a Smite. Sure enough, 
however, some Priests are going to make this judgment call to go with the HO 
instead of the fight underway. I guess this is why I've been so underwhelmed 
by the HO system. I like the idea of being able to bring a new element of 
skill to the battle, but the lack of a direct connection to the fight 
underway and the counter productive nature of some of the HO requirements 
doesn't really add that much to combat.
