Ok, so I get on last night, head to sol b and get with royals group.
Multi-dotting with another Shaman worked great, however neither he nor I
could get a debuff to stick on any mob in the 100+ times we tried.  Could
stick dots, DD, slow (ok slow is kinda a debuff, but couldn't get Malisement
to land though or Incapacitate)  It didn't really matter, or group did just
fine in there, but it would have been nice to make it even easier.  My
question is this though, if I had a hard time sticking debuffs on a blue mob
(I am 46) how in the hell am I ever supposed to stick a debuff on a much
stronger mob when I get higher level?  Did they nerf the shaman now so that
we can do more damage by combining the dots of others with our own but can't
land debuffs at all?  Oh, I should note, my dots NEVER got resisted, so
maybe it is a good thing...I dunno...thats why I called this post MINDLESS
RANT.
