So, I can do three quite reliably, but four never... probably my dial up

connection at work, or maybe its my choice of songs.  Nonetheless
I think triple twist is plenty for me to work as a solid bard up thru
high
levels, I won't be one of the "great ones" but thats all right with me.

To slam out triples consistently, and heck just to make it easier, I
try to arrange my song list so that the various triples I want are
next to each other; so I can play 123123123, or 456456456...
or mor interestingly 234234234; overlapping arrangements so
I can have more than 3 sets to play and still have the combos
be easy.

At the moment, I'm level 24, so working with that I have

1 Selo's Accelerando
2  Hymn of Restoration
3  Anthem De Arms
4  Selo's Consonant Chain
5  Jonathon's Whistling Warsong
6  Denon's Distruptive Discord
7  Brusco's Boastful Bellow
8  swap slot: Kelin's Lucid Lullaby or Cassindra's song of clarity

I think I had a better arrangement before I died but can't remember
what it was.

123 is not really useful although 121212 is good if we are running from
a mob.

234 is HP regen, haste, slow and snare, a healthy combination
345 is group haste, slow and snare, and self haste... very melee
oriented
456 is slow and snare, self haste, and AOE DOT/AC debuff
567 is self haste, AOE DoT/AC debuff and DD

678 is not a useful combination with Kelin's up, AOE mez and AOE DOT
are contradictory.  Its also not particularly handy with Clarity up,
that
should doubtless be near the Hymn

Any ideas for changes?  Either to songs on the list or to the order
of the list so as to get better combos?

Hymn DD Snare is a combo I end up playing when I've taken on
a mob I can't quite handle, allowing me to kite it while I heal up
some, so I can re-engage with more HP and the mob with
fewer HP.  On my layout this is a 247 twist, not exactly handy and
I'm using it when I can least afford a slip.

Hymn Clarity Accellerando is 128, thats not terrible, but
28(pause)28(pause) for down time isn't particularly handy


Well, anyway thats enough for some help for those who
haven't thought about this at all, and should be a good
starting point for more experienced bards to explain why
I'm crazy for not using song X or combo XYZ
