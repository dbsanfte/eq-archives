Yes, most people who aggro him die. Oftentimes, Wuoshi gets pulled to the
kael zoneline, and refuses to leave. The usual tactic for fixing this
(cause the GMs do nothing), is to have a bard kite him over to skyshrine.
Apparently when you zone to skyshrine, wuoshi goes back to his ring.

His aggro range is excesively large, but don't believe everything you hear.

No druid spell that I'm aware of is instantly fatal to a 45+ bard who is
twisting resist songs along with selos. Not even his breath is.

The emerald dragonscale tunic is supremely nice, as are the crescent blades
of luclin, and a couple of his other drops...so yea, his life expectency is
usually fairly short.
