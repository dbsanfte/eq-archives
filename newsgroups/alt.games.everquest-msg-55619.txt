Hey all,

I use AOL for dial up (mainly because I need many remote access points around
north america), however, I also play everquest.

Everquest works great with AOL 6.0, however, AOL 7.0 seems to have problems. 
My RTS led on my modem continuously flashes, and I lose about 90% of my packets
and eventually end up being disconnected.

Has anyone successfully got AOL 7 (dialin access) and Everquest working nicely
together?
