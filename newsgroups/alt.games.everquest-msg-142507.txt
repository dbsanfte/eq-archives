I'd say you share Cleric spells not because you trained with Clerics, but
rather because the source of your magic is the same as the source of
Clerical magic: your God.  A Paladin is a fighter who has devoted his life
to the service of a particular God, and is given magical power by that God.

We probably need to assume that there is some subtlety involved in Clerical
spells that makes it harder for Paladins to master them (because they devote
much of their time to training as fighters, and less to studying how to use
their God's magic), which is why they get only some of the spells, and at
later levels.

Druids and Shamen in EQ are kind of hard to explain.  The Shaman races have
no other priest class, and so Shaman are basically their equivalent of
Clerics.  Their power makes the most sense as coming from their God.  If one
has to justify why they do not have full Cleric powers, it would probably be
that they worship Gods that are less "civilized" than the Cleric Gods, or
come from races that are less tolerant of failure...someone who needs a lot
of healing in a fight is someone who you should get rid of and replace with
someone who isn't such a wuss, so they have less healing power, and more
spells that get to the point: helping their side hurt the other side.

Druids worship nature-oriented Gods, and so respect balance.  One could
justify their healing being not as good as Clerics on the grounds that their
spells are nature-oriented.  Their heals really should be in the form of
regeneration spells, not healing spells...they heal by accelerating nature's
healing, not directly calling on the power of their God to just fix things
quickly.  They slightly tip the balance, giving nature a push in the
direction they want.  Arguably, they should have no normal heals at all.

OK, while we are doing this, let's do Rangers and Shadow Knights.

I'd say Rangers are kind of like Paladins.  They are fighters who are in the
service of one of the Druidic Gods, and have been granted some magical
abilities by their God, so naturally their spells are mostly a subset of
Druid spells, although there are some Ranger-only spells their God has
granted them.  Like Paladins, they get the spells at later level, and get
less of them, because they are devoting much of their time to their fighting
and outdoorsman skills, and so have not mastered all the subtleties of their
God's magic.

There's no God involved with Shadow Knights, but we can presume that arcane
magic, like divine magic, has subtleties, and one who does not devote all
their time to it is not as good at it as one who does, so Shadow Knights
take longer to acquire Necromancer spells.  It's hard to explain Shadow
Knight-only spells.  With Paladins and Rangers, it is easy: their Gods
wanted it that way. :-)

I haven't looked at Beastlords, so am not going to speculate about them.
