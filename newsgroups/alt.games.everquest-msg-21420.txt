Better an asshole than a moron. You can only use the key once, genius.
Log in using your old station name and password, and then you can play
again. You can't create an account that's already created. Or, you could
also contact Sony directly and ask them to re-activate your account and
re-set your password. By the way, this information might have been good
to include in your original message. As I said, I'd rather be an asshole
than an idiot. Also, why shouldn't we assume you pirated the CD? Not too
long after you posted your original message in this thread, you posted
another one asking if you could by an account. Were you just blinded by
the obvious (call sony to see if you could re-activate your account) or
are you just too lazy, or are you just a fucking liar?
