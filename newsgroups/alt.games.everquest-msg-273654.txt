Thank you for your calm, reasoned reply.  The reason your earlier post
got ridiculed is because it *is* a common newbie mistake, and taking the
time to explain it slowly to each newbie is annoying, so people have
gotten out of the habit of doing so.  Frankly, if you've been using
newsgroups for 10 years, I'd expect you to have seen many examples of
people who copy a long post in its entirety only to say "I agree" or
"Me too" or whatever; I've seen such posts ridiculed in many other
newsgroups as well.

As you say, though, any of us can slip occasionally and post something
we shouldn't.  I can't speak for the readership at large, but for my
part I accept your apology for the ungainly post, and I encourage you
to participate in the other discussions in a.g.e.  (Hopefully with more
to say than "/agree"! :-)

	-- Don.
