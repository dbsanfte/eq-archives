I doubt you can target a group member by number like that.

If I understand your macro you need 5 hotkeys for your whole group. Why
not simply choose a group member by the function keys F2-F6? Grab a UI
that labels your group window. This has another benefit inmho. The
/target command is somewhat...stupid. More often than not it says 'I
can't see anybody with that name...' or so. The function keys work as
long as your party member is in the zone.

But to answer your question, I would make the hotkeys like:
Line1: /target %t
Line2: /pause 1
Line3: /cast 1
Just take a char into your target window and activate this macro. It
will rewrite itself so Line1 actually reads /target Jim for example.
Just set up your hotkeys for your entire group that way. But keep in
mind that you have to make it rewrite itself everytime you zone!
Since I keep forgetting such things I strongly advise against it.
Just use the F-Keys. ;)
