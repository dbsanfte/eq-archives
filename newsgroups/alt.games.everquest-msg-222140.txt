One reason to care is that backstab isn't the fastest raising skill in
the world. I twinked my rogue up, and powerleveled him with a druid
watching over his shoulder to the late 30's before grouping with a
friend's shadowknight and it took me forever to get backstab up to a
reasonable level. It wasn't until close to 50 or so that I actually
maxed it. Granted I didn't have the best haste item at the time
(dragonborn sash) and didn't often have haste on until the late 40's. I
guess if I'd had a faster recycle time on backstab it might have gone up
a bit faster.

The guy just sounds like a jerk though, and not bothering to get behind
the mobs doesn't show a lot of knowledge of the class either. Even with
fairly poor hide skill, when I grouped with my friend's sk I didn't have
that much trouble evading when I wanted too. I guess the other
alternative is he was trying to get his defense up. I'm glad I used the
druid to get a lot of levels before 50 as my defense would be pretty
pathetic if I'd worked behind the mobs only all that time. As it is now
it's still not maxed because I grouped from 50-65 and don't take enough
hits to keep dodge, riposte and defence going up. If I'm lucky I get a
couple of defensive improvements a week. I supposed I could take the
druid and go find some low dark blues and solo them from the front for a
while to push it up, but with evade, and escape when things get really
ugly I'm not sure it's worth the effort.
