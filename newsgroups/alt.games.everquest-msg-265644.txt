For me, in that area, EQ2 is even more odd.  Same kinda names, same kinda
mythology, same kinda overall concept, but 100% different interface,
different scope, different approach.

Makes it harder to pick up for me, because some stuff is familiar, but
other stuff is totally different, I'd have preferred either everything
different, or everything similar.

The mix is awkward.

However, it's the performance that'll stop me playing it I think - 5fps
with 6 other characters on screen isn't fun.
