You should easily be able to raise a bit of cash and buy an FBSS.    It
sells for like 1k nowadays.

Alternatively, a haste item (hangmans noose) drops from a level 40 or so mob
in TT (the hunter/forager cycle)

I remember doing TT with 1 group when I was level 35 or so, the named were
all red con, but 1 group easily dealt with them.

Do you volunteer the info about no haste/not so good gear?  Rejecting you
based on that is pretty damn shallow.. maybe you shouldn't be so forward
with what you tell them.

Are you in a guild?  That would be a source of people to group with

I wouldn't worry too much... not everybody is a super twink.

My monk was probably in a way worse state than you, when I leveled him.  I
first got haste at 49 when a friend donated an FBSS to me.  I only had
fighting batons up until the early 50's (I had a Jade Mace briefly that I
lost to a scammer...) then around 53 a friend bought me a Wu's/KD.

I still managed to find groups though, sure I had some people laugh at me,
insult me because of my gear etc.
Now when I see them, with my end-game cloak, belt, crown, weapon etc.. well
he who laughs last and all that.

Point is don't become disheartened and give up, theres more to the game than
arrogant fucks who like to brag about their gear and mock others
