I wish everyone in this thread, myself included, could have exercised 
your level of patience and interest in promoting understanding to this 
point. I thank you for that.

The guild you mentioned did appear to be flawed before the trials. Imho, 
if you wound up with half the people in the guild after the issue of 
flagging had passed than when you started, you could feel confident that, 
while your numbers were fewer, the guild as it remained was stronger for 
it.

I *do* understand that some people show their true colors in situations 
such as this. I *do* understand guild dynamics than can throw a monkey 
wrench into things. What I *don't* understand is the insistence that this 
guild disfunction is not the root cause of these guild splits. Shall we 
pave over every rocky part of the path to 65 and ultra uberty so that any 
guild and their sister can make it, or should it be something that 
requires a little more in the way of a concerted effort - the loyalty, 
commitment and cohesion I have mentioned time and again - by a player and 
their brethren for a common goal? I prefer the latter. It seems to be 
*that* preference more than anything else that is branding me the heretic 
here.

No matter. My guild will have my support when we reach the trials or 
whatever other obstacles might take their place. That's all that is 
important.
