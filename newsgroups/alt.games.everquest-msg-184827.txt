A guildy of mine was running a P166 with a max of 128MB RAM and I think a
16MB card.  He didn't bother buying any expansion past Velious.

Anyway, I have a P700, 512MB RAM, GF2MX64 video.  I have to turn off most of
the bells & whistles but it performs ok in all but bazaar (duh) and POK
(have to stare at ground, autofollowing someone).

You must have EVERY SINGLE new model turned off.  When you first start up
the game, before you get to the server screen, go to the Options page and do
everything they recommend that will lower the memory requirement.

After you do all that you'll still have problems in some zones.  The fact
that you have a problem in Unrest is an interesting surprise...because I
knew that as one of the most laggy before they added Kunark to the game, but
I assumed that it would be ok now.  Very interesting.
