Hello.

I have a 2 computer network, we both play EQ. We frequently get disconnected
back to the character selection screen when zoning. Anyone know the root
cause for this type of behavior?


This used to happen when we had dialup. We now have ADSL, and the problem
persists. (both machines)

I use internet connection sharing, but once, I played for a while without it
installed and with no network, and got disconnected in exactly the same
fashion.

I use a hub.

I have reinstalled windows numerous times, the problem is unaffected.

Machine 1 (the sharing machine) is a Celeron 700 overclocked. I have clocked
it at standard and the problem persists. It has 192 megs of ram and a
voodoo3.

Machine 2 (the sharing client) is a P3 550, not overclocked. 96 megs of ram.
Currently has a voodoo3, had a voodoo2 and the problem was unaffected by the
upgrade.


We got kunark. Porting to Dreadlands often resutls in machine 2 requiring a
hard reboot. Other zones normal,. frequent disconnect back to the character
selection screen.

We got Velious. The problem persists.

My Pings are good. I have little lag. I live in Northeastern North America.

SO.... what can y'all suggest to help alleviate this annoying problem?

Thanks in advance!

Androck
