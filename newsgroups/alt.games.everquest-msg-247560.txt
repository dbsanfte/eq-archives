Yes. One enchanter won't be enough stun power. AE groups should bring
two for safety. Throw out one of the clerics. A solid set of players
used to doing it might get by with one enchanter, but that obviously
wasn't the case here.

I'm not sure you were doing it right from your description in the
first place anyways. Of course the casters will be getting aggro, most
of the mobs are only being hit by them, AE taunt notwithstanding.
That's supposed to happen. But they're supposed to spend so much time
stunned that it doesn't matter.
