Specialization reduces the mana cost of casting spells.  You can only
have one specialization above skill 50 (it will cap at 200 eventually).
The benefit is a skill/20 cost reduction (so max of 10% for your high
specialization and 2.5% for the rest).  My Druids are specialized in
Alt, mostly because heals are Alt and Druid healing needs all the
help it can get (Roots and some buffs are also Alt).  With Alt Spec
200, Mana Preservation 2, Improved Healing 2, and Spell Haste 2 your
L44 LoY quested spell (Healing Waters) will heal 425-467 hp for 160
mana with a cast time of 3.23 seconds.  That's not Cleric quality
healing, but it ain't bad either, especially with decent mana regen.
