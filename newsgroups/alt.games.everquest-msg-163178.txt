Well, I never said if the 30 second timer starts at the moment of the
last activity from the client (that is, when you start to go LD) or
after the user-specified command is executed.

(Frankly, I didn't really think about it much myself.)

So how about this.  If someone chooses to use the LD autopilot
feature, the 30 second disconnect timer starts *after* the LD auto
command is executed.

I'd much rather have my Necro FD than just stand there, even if it
means ten or so more seconds before I get removed from the game.

Thanks for the feedback!
