Actually.. this does exist as an exploit of sorts. 


If I solo in Plane of Storms by myself (65 Druid), I get about 4% AA
per kill for the frogs.   IF I group with my 65 Enchanter, BUT send
him way on the other side of the zone (out of range of the XP), the
druid gets 5%AA per kill.  Since I believe the 2-person group gets a
20% bonus, that would work out just about perfectly.


I have been able to do this with 3 toons as well.  

It works.. try it.. :)
