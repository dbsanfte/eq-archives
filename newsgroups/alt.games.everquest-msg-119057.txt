Because that's the whole concept of Cancel Magic. To remove buffs from NPCs,
some DOTs, and even Mesmerize. Cancel Magic is a good spell to open with
against Shaman NPCs since they tend to Haste, SOW, and use other buffs. So
naturally, it has legitimate uses and illegitimate uses.

Which is why Tash and the Necro Scent spells are poison based so that you
can't use Cancel Magic to remove them.
