It's not out yet...gotta wait until January 4th, 2002.  Until then,
it's one of the movies that ensures my LaserDisc player has a spot in
my stack of components. :-)

Besides BB, before the LaserDisc can go, the following need to come
out on DVD:

	1. The Wizard of Speed and Time
	2. Time After Time
	3. Star Wars
	4. Real Genius
