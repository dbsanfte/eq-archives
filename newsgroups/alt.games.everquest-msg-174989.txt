From the vantage point of level 65, everything below 60 is pretty immaterial
because it'll take me, what, 3 days to blast through it?

Anyway...

When the enchanter dies, root still works.
When the cleric dies, root still works.
When the monk dies, root still works.
On most mobs, even without unresistable debuffs, root still works.

Root is shared by so many classes, and has so much usefulness, that I don't
see any real comparison to most any other spell.
