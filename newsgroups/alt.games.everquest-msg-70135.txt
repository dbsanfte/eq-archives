 Well half of those deal with getting the PLer to come help you. I was
going under the assumption that that wasn't an issue.

 If you don't have a willing Druid to PL you then yeah, the fungi is
better. Overall though I don't consider it the most effective way to PL.
It's a nice way to solo but it's not powerleveling in my book. At least
not once you get past level 15 or whatever.

 A lot of those are even't an issue. Most Druids wont go OOM by simply
casting regen and thorns and tossing the occassional heal. As long as
the PLee hits the mob for 1, the damage shield can do 99% of the damage
for all it cares. Faction issues? With the old world and three
expansions, there's always alternative spots to level if faction is an
issue.
