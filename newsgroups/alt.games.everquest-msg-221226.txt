Heh.  I don't have a good reason.  I have a 250 baker.  I was just annoyed 
that if I run out of fishrolls on a character I'd have to either (a) run 
him up to 100something real quick, or (b) log the 250 baker and make some 
and trade them around. Plus, seems like every character eventually needs 
baking for some quest or other, and since I had a filleting knife handy 
and there's a meat vendor in shadowhaven, hey, might as well get them 
-all- done. It just made more sense to dump all the wis/int gear on the 
character, run the skill up, transfer the gear, etc, than to wait until 
that character happened to need it for something.

And now they're all up to 122 brewing.  And about half of them to 122 
pottery.  I'm only gonna do tailoring to 26 and smithing to 76 though. :)
