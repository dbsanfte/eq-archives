Thanks for getting the point Jazz. I agree totally that going too far
the other way would be equally as problematic. 

As with all risk/reward the ideal situation is that you get a slight
boost for taking on a tougher mob than your regular exp group at that
level. A reason/reward for pushing your boundaries.  The focuses are
level based, so that gives a pretty good tier system. Level III items
shouldn't drop outside planes or L50+ zones. Period. Why would they?
They can't be used until higher level spells are cast anyway. Level I
and II should drop in the 'tougher' areas those groups would be exping
in. Why would a L35 character be killing mobs for exp that drop an
earring they can't use the effect on for 10 levels? It's just silly IMO.

I agree they should be available to non-uberguild people in the main,
but it should require a little effort to get. Fear/Hate/PoG minibosses
are a good example, Deep Seb, Chardok, or HS for the level III stuff,
maybe SolB, Guk, and KC for level II? Runnyeye/Najena for level I?

Putting these effects on something like Cougar claw earrings which
everyone and their dog has, means you might as well. Throwing these
effects on such common and *tradeable* items, may well give them a huge
beta test to guage changes, but also almost guarantees SOME rebalancing
changes down the road.

I'm hearing the first whispers of changes already in last night's patch,
with some items having focuses changed. No doubt they will be viewed as
huge nerfs. Be prepared for changes to focuses over the coming weeks
because IMO the game can't sustain the volume of focuses this patch
brought in. Casters need balancing, not only versus melees, but also
versus other casting classes. Necros need endgame help, wizards need
50-59 help, etc. Globally raising the bar vs. pure melee alone in such a
clumsy way won't have any longterm benefits (which are what is needed)

Look at the changes over the years to rangers and rogues. That didn't
come about by simply throwing 100hps and 5% extra haste onto every melee
with 250pp to spend.
