Yep, I'm the only nuker (well, we have a druid but that character is a bot
that's being three boxed and casts TR).  I mal'ed for the Shaman's sake, but
let him know beforehand that we'd see how it would go with me not malaising
(heck, my malaises often got resisted).  Slows still seem to land well
enough and I can throw in plenty of Firebolt of Tallon on most mobs and
still have a decent reserve for emergencies.  Footnote:  This is LDoN, not
PoP.  In PoP, I can understand the need to have every mob debuffed.
