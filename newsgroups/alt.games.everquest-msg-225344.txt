Hey all

There is something about EQ lately that drives me nuts, it makes my PC 
crash.

Can't really say exact when and how, but something about the time I bought 
LDoN and some updates.

Every now and then my PC just freezes, and the pattern is, it only happens 
when I play EQ, I can work on computer and play other games for hours (yes 
I do that now and then). No errors or nothing, sometimes when freeze 
occurs I can move mouse around for some seconds then it freezes too. Only 
thing is to reboot.

So what I got? Well this:

AMD XP 2400+, 768MB memory which is all good, Soltek mobo with VIA KT133A 
chipset, Radeon 9500 Pro (DX9 and Catalyst 3.7) and a 3Com NIC.

Anybody else have some of these problems? Which has occured lately (within 
last 3 months)??
