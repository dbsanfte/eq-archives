It was missing any meaningful action whatsoever.  It was a boring
book.  I just hope Jordan hasn't lost his touch.  In a recent
interview he seemed to defend the book so I think he's lost touch
with his audience and has a bit of a chip on his shoulder.  It
sounded very much like he was blaming his readers for the lack of
enthusiasm.

Of course if he's just writing the books for his own entertainment
that's fine.  He'll just have to live with his audience not enjoying
the result.  That seems to be the majority opinion on CoT.  It is an
opinion I share.
