No, because Feign Death was designed for artificial intelligence, and codes
the game to make it believe, depending on skill level, that you're dead.
Computer cares not to see if the word "  's corpse  " is written to the end
of your name.  So if you feign death while PVP or Duel.... you're good as
dead.  Literally.
