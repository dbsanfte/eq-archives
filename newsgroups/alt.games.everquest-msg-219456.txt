    Slaughter is easy only because it is straightforward. Go in, kill stuff.
My fastest wins were not with slaughter, but because of the variability of
the other missions my fastest average time is with slaughter. Reducing that
variability somewhat would go a long way to making things balanced.

    They need to convert the current "seed" to take into account the total
dungeon population.

    I've noticed a few assassination mobs that hit very hard, but those are
usually WAR-types with few guards. The weaker-hitting mobs have guards all
around them, and usually also have the ability to Gate back to those guards
if you try to pacify-pull them out. As long as that's as intended, it sounds
fairly balanced to me. It also gives groups an incentive to have a warrior
in the group versus SK/PAL.

    With the new set of type 7 augments, people will adventure in many
places to fill up on augs. But right now, people are going to where their
number one item is, and to the easiest area (Mistmoore). You'll need to wait
a while, after people have their number one item, before you see folks
spreading out.

    SOE should not get involved in loot distribution. To do so is asking for
trouble, especially when the word "automated" is used. If you don't have
groupmates that you've learned you can trust, make new friends.

    That would be a nice twist on Rescue missions. Right now, the race to
zone-in is pretty anti-climactic, and searching for the target is a major
pain in the arse. So turn it around - make the finding part easy, running
around an empty dungeon, and make getting the target out again the hard
part.

    They do plan to expand the whole LDoN idea to further themes.
