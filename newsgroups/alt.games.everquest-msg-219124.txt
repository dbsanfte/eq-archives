Also worthy of mention, if just as an aside...

Back when the Mith 2 hander *was* useful because of it's haste, before every
melee was handed an over 20% haste item the moment they dinged level 6 (and
got a long lasting corpse), two handers did not have the same damage bonuses
they do today.   It had barely more of a damage bonus than a one hander.  So
it sucked then as well.
