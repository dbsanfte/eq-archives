Read every bit of it line for line and ya know what ?

 The last paragraph "Big fish in little pond" probably is the best
observation I have ever been handed to me. I do have fun every time I play
and ya know, thats what its all about.

 Think I'll stop being such a ratings munger and maybe I will have time to
play and have fun.

 Thanks CF , in ways you'll prolly never understand. Brought me back to
Earth so to speak :-)
