Agreed. No issues there.

Yes, that is the true 'meaning' of the messages. But that isn't what the 
system tells you, thats the information an experienced player learns to 
discern from the misinformation they actually do tell you.

But then why doesn't the message simply say what it really means:

%t is a couple levels bigger than you.
%t is a couple levels lower than you.
%t is the same level as you.
%t is between 5 and 8 levels lower than you.
etc...

After all that is *all* the messages tell you. They don't tell you if 
you can win, they don't give you any indication of whether or not you'll 
survive.

That's my whole point. An experienced player reads "Yello - Looks like 
he'll mop the floor with you" as 1 to 2 levels up... "Blue - You would 
probably win this fight" as 3-6 levels down, etc.

But the secret to learning this message map is either to have the 
inspiration to look it up in a strategy guide that spells it out, or 
with a collection of pointless deaths.

I'm not suggesting they "change" how the conning system works, I'm just 
saying rewrite the messages so that newbies read them and get the 
information they are actually conveying (relative level hint) instead of 
some blatant misinformation about their chances of taking it.
