My mage has been bound at the soulbinder in POK since first level, only 
once or twice binding "closer to the action", and then changing back. 
Of course on FV thats' not as much of a stretch, as we often can't bind 
all that near where we'd like anyway.  Part of my reasoning is that I'm 
useless on CR without some malachite, so being near a bank is a plus.

But my cleric would bind right outside the entrance to just about any 
zone he fought in.  Especially after getting his Faithstone (clicky gate 
to BB, in his case).  Deaths happen, and I see it as the responsibility 
of the cleric to pop back up as near the bodies as is feasible, most of 
the time.  Anyone else, no big deal, but the cleric, well, its part of 
the job description.

Honestly, I probably ought to do the same thing with my mage for LDoN 
runs, where we often eschew rez till afterwards, so as to cut down time. 
  And after all, CR in LDoN is very rarely anything more than walking 
back to the spot where the bodies were, since the mobs seem to wander 
back to their starting positions for the most part.  On the other hand, 
very often starting my run back from POK means I can grab a KEI, which 
probably balances out the 5 minutes it takes me to get to Everfrost and 
use the Magus to get closer to the target zone (or to go Akanon>LFay)
