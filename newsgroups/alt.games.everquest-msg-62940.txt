I don't do eight hours online unless its for a raid, or I really want
to finish a level. Most of the time you shouldnt be asked to be on
that long. Dying on raids? Get used to it. Make friends with higher
level guilds. We had a bad hate raid, but a high level guild we were
on good terms with came in and make short work of our corpse recovery.
