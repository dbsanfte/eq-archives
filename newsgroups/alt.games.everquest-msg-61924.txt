I know Verant puts invisible NPC's under the world to generate "generic"
texts like "It's raining".
In Lavastorm there is a NPC like this in one of the lava pools, not hidden
under the earth as he is supposed to be. Several of my friends found him and
I heard someone even struck a few blows on it, but it stayed invisible, even
with see invis on :-/

Very odd all in all.
