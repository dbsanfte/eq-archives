Once again, comparing Netscape 4.7 to IE6. Netscape 6 was based off of 
the Mozilla 8.7 source, which was not in any way ready for release, that 
was a mistake by Netscape. Netscape 6.1 is based off of the Mozilla 
0.9.2.1 source which is much better, however nothing tops Mozilla 0.9.4. 
So how can you say it sucked when you never used it? Sounds like a 
little kid who says peas are nasty, even though he never tried them 
before. lol

Nothing much to relearn in Mozilla *shrug* But once again, you are 
putting down a browser you never used in your life, yet somehow you just 
"know" it is worse then Internet Explorer lmao.

lol, a dozen, what rock did your crawl out from under? 
http://browserwatch.internet.com/browsers/browsers-big-am.html (but more 
then a dozen lol) Goes to show you don't know much or anything about any 
other browser besides IE and Netscape 4.7.
