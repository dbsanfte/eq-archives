Unless you play on a red server I don't see any where that "advantage" has
any meaning.
You are going to have to work harder for your AA than they did...sure...It's
a nerf and in any nerf those that got there first will always be better off
than those that took their time about it (for whatever reason) whether it
was looting an item or killing a Mob or gaining exp...where does it hinder
you tho? You and everyone of your level now have to work harder than they
did at your level but they need to do the same to get more exp...so the gap
is the same, did you think you would catch them up? Is it a race?

Power players always have the advantage over casual players or average
players...they'd still be ahead of you if this was brought in with AA in the
first place, difference is they'd have less points than they have now but so
would you.
