I'm an erudite enchantress following Prexus and the Order of Three in Qeynos
is "apprehensive" to the point that I can't even get the noob bat fur quest
out of them. I couldn't even train there until I got my illusion human spell
which brought it up to indifferent. Anyone know how I can raise that
faction?
