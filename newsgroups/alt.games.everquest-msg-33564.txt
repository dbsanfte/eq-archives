Filtering works, unless you happen to be a 50+ dual wielding class with
max haste.

Playing my 54 rogue, with everything turned off I can turn off, I can
scroll a tell off screen before I can read it.

A minimal fix for this would be to combine the double attack messages:

You pierce an Icepaw Kobold for 45 + 52 points of damage.

Better would be to report damage every 5 seconds or so:

You have done 345 points of piercing damage to an Icepaw Kobold.

And best would be to put them somewhere else entirely, like in a
seperate window, horizontally scrolling across ticker-style, or just
quickly flashed up on your/the mobs heath bar.
