It's interesting to see your guild having deep discussions about loot.  Our
guild is, too.  We're thinking about merging with another guild - we've been
raiding side-by-side for over a year, so we're practically one guild
already.  There are some details to hammer out, of course, one of which is
loot.  We use officer award.  So does the other guild, but they have a tool
that tracks attendance and use that as a guideline.  So if we do merge,
we'll likely have to adopt the same tool.  Our officers have assured us that
attendance has always been a factor - it's just that they've been going by
personal recollection of attendance rather than formally recording it.  And
they also stress that attendance is just one factor amongst many, and that
they are *not* going to be moving to DKP.  Still, formal attendance taking
is going to be a cultural change for us; I wonder how we'll respond.  I have
no problem with it - but then, I'm on five nights a week.

Oh my yes.  Recently, our guild officers decided we were no longer going to
be farming Vex Thal - we would be doing Elemental Planes exclusively.  That
made the clerics quite upset.  In all the time we farmed AHR, we got zero
breastplates and only two leggings - really bad luck on the AHR drops.  (The
day after the announcement that we were abandoning VT, Drinal's alliance of
Japanese guilds killed AHR, and a Mail of Judgement dropped.  I was beside
myself.)  Plus clerics had always been just about last on all the other
plate armor drops - these always went to warriors and other tanks first.
And just when we clerics were beginning to be awarded some loot, no more VT.
Most clerics still have lots of Skyshrine Armor.  Meanwhile, a tank was
awarded some elemental *gauntlets* that have more AC than my *breastplate*.

Plus, the officers also made the announcement that all plate drops would be
going to our two Main Tanks until they were decked out.  For the good of the
guild, they say.  Meaning us clerics will have to wait for the MT's to be
decked out, then the other tanks, and then finally us.

So yeah, the clerics in my guild are unhappy with the decision to abandon
VT.  Personally, I wasn't so upset about that as I was with the decision to
deck out the Main Tanks - as if AC and HP weren't important to clerics, too.

I can't make too much of an issue about it, though, because I myself have
gotten some really nice drops.  Never mind that I have Heraldic Greaves and
a Skyshrine BP; a lot of my other equipment has really nice stats and
effects.  So my complaining would be whining at best, and loot-whorish at
worst.  But others also have felt the same way, so hopefully our collective
voices will be heard.  One recent annoucement stated that after the two MT's
get decked out, all other plate classes would be treated equally.  That's a
hopeful sign, although that still means I'm gonna be stuck with my SS BP for
a long, long time.

That's exactly what I feel about DKP and other point systems.  Especially
when I read stories about how loot is being forced to rot when no one bids
on it - "The only fair thing to do," DKP advocates say.  "Insanely stupid,"
I say.  =)  DKP does nothing to distribute loot for the good of the guild,
IMO, and that should be an overriding factor.

Heh.  True dat.

Yeesh.  I guess I won't be putting in a cross-server app then.  =)  Looks
like I'm wasting the AA I am putting into SCR.  Yeah, I know everyone says
SCR is a waste for a cleric in a high-end raiding guild.  I don't care; I
want BoR to last more than 30 minutes, darnit!

I have SCM3, MGB, DivA3 (which I regret, I hardly ever use it), RC1, and
SCR2.  I'm working towards SCR3, and am still debating SCRM.  Gonna have to
do some research on how many extra ticks of Supernal Elixir I get between
SCR3 and SCRM to decide if it's worth it.

You'll have to tell me in a couple of weeks how a points-based system is
working out for y'all.
