Hehe insane for sure, rangers one of their most needed classes? :)

The ranger requirement 6 seemed odd:

6. Must have EQ and AM3.

I would of thought that most rangers would be meleeing at this point, glad
to know we are only useful for 2 minutes an hour >_>  They want you to have
250aa but only need EQ and AM3...so sinking points into inate charisma,
finishing blow and riposte would be fine.  :/
