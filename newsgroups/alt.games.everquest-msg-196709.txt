A) can't do MAGELO from netscape 4.7.  I'm a luddite, what can I say.
B) Its a pretty short post, as far as posts from me go, if you are driven to
read all of everything I post then you have far far better things to
complain about than this one.
C) Not being Magelo capable, I don't know what the big deal is about it; I
suppose its less work for the poster than jotting down all the stats on
every item or jotting down all character stats, but for the reader, whats
the difference?   In fact it seems  simpler to me to get the information
this way
D) Does Magelo post as I set this one up, Naked, Geared up, Stats from
Gear?  Those were the points I thought informative or interesting.  I wasn't
crowing (or trying to defend) the PHat LEwts Paax is wearing, just trying to
show what sort of baseline he's working from.  HP shaman, that's the
concept.
