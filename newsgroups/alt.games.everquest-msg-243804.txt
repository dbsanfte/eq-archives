Poke around http://www.norrathsstudio.org/phpBB4ns/ for a bit, I think
some of the artists there have sites where they offer commissions for
sigs, Magelo backgrounds, and portraits. Be careful with finding sig
makers from other places, there have been a LOT of cases of sig makers
who take commission for sigs that they use ripped off art from. The NS
people tend to be a big target for these hacks.
