Then what's your beef?  I mean, really, what are you arguing about.  You
started a whiny post yesterday about how this will ruin your gameplay, and
now you find it's not and you're still wanting to argue about it.

From your original post:

"I am very sad if this is true and ask you to look at the issue from my
circumstances.  I'm an older player who doesn't nearly get the time to play
it seems that many do.  I've been playing almost since the beginning and my
highest level character is 43.  I quit for about a year because although I
love the game, I just could not log on and med for 12 minutes, look around
for a mob, nuke him, and then sit back down to med again."

You notice anything about this little glass of whine?  Every single sentence
starts with 'I'.

And now you say you're not affected.  Why are you bitching like 6 year old
girl?

> You're the kind that wants others to be unhappy.

Not others.  Just you.  It's all about you anyway, isn't it?

> I just wanted everyone to have fun

Oh, you're such a philanthropist!  Please tell me, oh great benefactor,
about your plans for peace on earth!

> You're a selfish little asshole

Goodie gumdrops!  More highbrow name calling!

>I could care less, I just want to have fun.

As do I.  To that end, please respond to this one as quickly as possible.  I
have to leave in a little while, and I want to get as much out of this camp
as I can.

Or cross that one little line so I can go ahead and plonk you.
