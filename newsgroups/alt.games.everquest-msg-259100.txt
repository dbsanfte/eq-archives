You're just making these things unnecessarily complicated.

1) Walk down the street in your starting city

2) Find a ground spawn worth  *EVEN* more than EVEN more platinum

3) Pick up said ground spawn

4) Sell to nearest merchant, remembering to beg a charisma buff from the
nearest enchanter or shaman

5) If nearest enchanter or shaman refuses to grant charisma buff, whine,
call him a noob and finally insult his parentage
