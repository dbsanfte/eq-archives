    *chuckle* Yeah, suuuure it would. AD&D requires near-constant
intervention by a GM to prevent expoiting of the worst sort. Try and set up
a game around AD&D and it'll soon be infested with min-maxers and will have
absolutely no diversity.

    AD&D had no downtime? All the time spent trying get to the next day's
activities while the frigging roleplayer in the group had to waste hours of
real time talking with every NPC in the inn - that wasn't downtime? Have you
ever played AD&D with someone that likes to haggle, and had to sit through
them trying to buy rations? All the time the GM takes preparing for the
night's activities - that's all uptime, right?

    12-20 hours per day?!? Lord, the top guilds in EQ only ask for five or
six hours per day. You might be exaggerating here a bit.

    STR in EQ increases the probability of landing a higher-damage blow. Not
by much unless your ATK is in a very narrow range, but that's what it does.
In AD&D, increasing damage per attack leads to stupidity like darts being
the most uber weapon in game for someone with 18/00 STR (each dart doing 7-9
damage, you can throw three per round before specialization). Does it make
sense to you that the strongest warriors do the most damage by hanging back
and using wizard weapons, or that a level 1 warrior can take out up to three
orcs per round with darts, something he couldn't do with any other weapon?
EQ does have the same sort of stupidity, but it comes in with weapon delay.
Anyone here remember the 3/10 weapon from Frontier Mountains that was the
best weapon in game?

    AGI beyond 75 also increases AC, but at a very minimal rate. Again, in
EQ stats do have an effect but it's quite muted compared with AD&D. In AD&D,
someone who rolled well to start with was a god.

    In AD&D, there's a GM there to coddle you and tailor the entire world to
suit your party. If the random encounter roll was a werewolf for your level
1 party, he'd fudge the roll to spare you all the wipeout. There's also no
morons going AFK, and at least one person knows how to play the game. No
such guarantees in EQ. EQ also has random groupability - you can log on at
any time and at least try and get a pickup group. I hear that doesn't work
so well for AD&D. =)

    I'm not saying EQ is perfect - lord, look up some of my posts. But it
isn't nearly as bleak as you portray it to be.
