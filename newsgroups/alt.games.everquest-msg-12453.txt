Don't quite get what you mean, but here goes.  Firstly, I've seen Ghoulbanes
go for 2000pp on my server, average price according to some sites for my
server I think is 1500pp.  Secondly, the fact I don't have a terribly high
damage output is the very reason to get a Ghoulbane, plus Paladins are more
defensive than most classes so wearing banded (which is -2AC, -30HP from
Mith BP) for a time won't hurt that much, especially at my level (even most
people I see get under 30HPs at my level either end up dying or need healing
greater than 30HP to prevent death - most MoBs at my level can hit for 30).
Think about it, let's say I do 15 hits in a fight (rather conservative for
an even fight), each doing on average +2 dam (also conservative)compared to
my old weapon (Berserker Sword), that makes 30 more HPs of damage.  In two
levels, I will have a chance of doing double damage, therefore increasing
the benefits.  In the meantime, I can make the 700pp for the Mith BP before
I can save the 1000pp for the Ghoulbane.  In response to your question, I am
currently level 18, nearly lvl 19, gaining exp at about a level a week.
Even if Ghoulbanes drop to 700pp in this time I still wouldn't be that
concerned (as the Mith BP is worth 700pp anyway - and I would have probably
still bought it).  I should point out that these things were given to me so
it is no loss of effort on my part.
