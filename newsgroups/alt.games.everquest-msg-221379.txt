Heh, that's actually a small piece of the puzzle too.  A high level
Warrior without a group has nothing to do in EQ (we'll exclude the
tradeskill masochists from consideration here).  Not many Paladins
solo at high level, because it's hard to find XP mobs that Paladin
DPS is sufficient to kill.  But Warriors sitting around LFG see
horseshit soloing ability as infinitely better than what they have.
