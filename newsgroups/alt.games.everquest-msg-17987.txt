What, you don't like your games to give you an element of risk? Would you
like "/godmode" added?

The point of these minor obstacles is to overcome them. If you could
memorise your entire spellbook, there'd be no skill in selecting the 8 you
need, and sometimes it's a tough choice about which to use. It's a gameplay
thing. If you could see while meditating, there'd be no fun in reaching
level 35, nor any skill in finding somewhere safe to effectively sleep for a
while. It's a gameplay thing. If you could bind a melee character in any
zone, there'd be no fun running eight zones to find your corpse (ok, maybe
not fun, but it's a gameplay thing...). Trade skills fail occasionally, and
cost a fortune and hours of frustration. But it's a gameplay thing - you
have to excel over time. Downtime for meditating is a gameplay thing,
without which there'd be no skill selecting the right group and opponents
and finding safe spots.
