I did one society task, did not do more, as the sheer tedium of making 10 
of almost any given tier 2 item just plain sucks, particularly, when the 
item being requested is in some area of expertise I chose to completely 
ignore.

I did one tradeskill writ, and decided it was a stupid waste of time to 
do any more of them.  It is quite expensive, the only reward is the 
status points, no cash, for making somewhat expensive items.  In 
addition, for a scribe, at least, it requires app 3 spells specifically, 
app 4 won't work.  So, basically, I am spending on the order of 90 
minutes to make 10 spells that will be taken from me, and that cost me 30 
or so silver to make, in exchange I get some status points.  Instead, I 
can get writs for Thundering Steppes that I can solo, that will give me 
more status per writ, take less time to finish, and give me decent xp as 
well.  Hard choice to make, Not.
