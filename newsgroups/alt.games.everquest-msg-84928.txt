Actually nearly everyone said 'no'... and a suprisingly large proportion of
people said 'no' in a very strident manner, at every opportunity, and this
was back when the Verant Boards were still open to public posting (can we
say flamefest?)

The gist of the response to the log-in poll was "Why should we pay $30/month
for the level of CS support you promised us NOW?"

So now Verant are asking $36.99/month (if we didn't want it at $30/month
WHAT makes them think we want it NOW at a HIGHER cost?!?!?) to spoon-feed
uber lewt to people too lazy and impatient to work for it themselves...
WAITAMINUTE... isn't that the justification for shutting down all those EBay
sales?

I guess "protecting intellectual property" translates into english as
"Nobody is allowed to sell items for cash except US!"
