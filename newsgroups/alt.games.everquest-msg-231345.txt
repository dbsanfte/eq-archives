Thats not really what he's saying.  He's saying when you get to the level
that you're killing in NToV, you won't be caring about faction.

As a Mage, you're most likely a special case in this reguard.

Heh... as a side note, for a bored elemental level raiding force it's not
even important for the mages.   It takes about 15 mintues to smash a path
through the entrance area of ToV to get to the north wing, and perhaps 5 or
10 more to get to Aary's setup place.
