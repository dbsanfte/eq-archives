yeah yeah, your not fooling anybody...

It would help if you actually knew the name of the program, because it is
most definately not aimed at people that don't "have a clue"

There are 2 programs you can download. The one your refering to is ShowEQ
(or SEQ)
URL: http://seq.sourceforge.net/

The other is SINS (Sins Is Not Showeq)
URL: http://sins.sourceforge.net

Disclaimer: its your account to get banned, not mine.

Note: If you use a modified (trojaned) version of libEQ.a, and it steals
your password (or whatever else they want to do), don't come crying here
because I don't think *anybody* will have sympathy for you.
