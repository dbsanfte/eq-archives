I was in TS for the first time and a member of our group had bad faction
with centaurs. One attacked her, and the group fought back and killed it.
Now, even though I didn't touch it I have bad faction. I was really hoping
to avoid it because I wanted to do some harvesting out there without having
to worry about them. Is there any way to repair the faction with centaurs?
