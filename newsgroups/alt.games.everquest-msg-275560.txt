So far, I have exclusively used slashing weapons in EQ2. I was figuring that
I would always be able to find a useful slash weapon, and should I come upon
an extraordinary crush or pierce weapon, I could always raise my skill then.

But just now it struck me that maybe different weapons are better against
different mobs? Any thoughts on this?
