so - it seems to me customary donations for a port are 10-20pp.

what is considered customary for SoW?  other buffs?

being newbie, I rarely have more than 1-2pp to my name.  As I previously
mentioned, I generally offer whatever money and loot I have is someone
"drive-by-buffs" me...

But if I am seeking a buff, what is customary to donate??

Also, I have stacks and stacks of copper coins in the bank...  also quite a
bit of silver - how can I convert these to gold/plat?  is there a
"money-changing" office somewhere?  I do I just lug around 800 copper
pieces?
