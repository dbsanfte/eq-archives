"your friends only want to do things that you CANNOT do"

That about sums it up. Although I would say "will not do" or "do not
enjoy doing" as opposed to "cannot".

ME is a big zone, but there are really only certain areas that are
popular camp spots, and the reason people hunt there. This still
doesn't address the over-flow of high level characters in the zones
that drop the items every one seems to need to play post 50.

No, I no longer enjoy the retired characters. To play them effectively
(with the people they grew up with) I would have to enter them into
the 51-60 game that those other people have decided they want to
engage in. I guess I wasn't quite clear on one point. My characters
are more than just their class/level. They are the sum total of the
experiences which include their relationships with the people
(characters/classes) they have grouped with along the way. Sure I can
take them to another guild, or choose not to raid with my
guild/friends, but at that point the characters cease to be "alive"
for me. Once that point is reached I no longer have a solid connection
to the character, and it is time to re-roll. I can just as easily stay
in contact with friends via tell, guild chat, or chat channels while
playing an alt and still enjoy the style of play I prefer.

And what types of things were you doing?....I am willing to bet that
you were doing all of the things that high level players find
themselves doing so that they can move on to higher level content. The
kinds of things that make it all but impossible to play casually.

Only if the people you play with have the same goals as you. I thought
I made that clear. The rarest class/race in EQ is a casual player
post-50 that isn't solely interested in leveling up or improving their
gear.

That may be the only "forced" difference, but that is not what
happens. It is a universal truth that post-50 players and guilds
"change". You either start putting in serious amounts of time, or you
watch your friends evolve and grow beyond you. Why should I keep
playing at a level and style of play that no longer suits me? It is
possible to level too high in EQ, depending on your style of play.

Which is what generally happens once they hit 50+.
