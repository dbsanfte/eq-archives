Taunting can help you gain or recover aggro.   Taunting does not help you
maintain aggro.  (and may actually cost you aggro if you are already on top
of the hate list.)   If you're in a situation where you need to taunt,
things are already going (or gone) to shit.

Proc, baby, proc.

The best thing I ever did for my warrior's aggro was completing his epic.
Both with my epics, and with my two hander (Frostreaver, 150 DD plus stun) I
can proc often enough to maintain aggro, even though the rest of the group
(or in the case of the epic, the rest of the raid) is doing much more melee
damage than me.

Before it, even with super fast hitting non-procing weapons,  most of the
time the paladin ended up tanking in exp groups, and the entire raid on
raids.   Mashing the taunt button did not accomplish anything, other than
contributing to CTS.
