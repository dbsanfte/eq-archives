According to the list of stuff published on the Sony site-something like
"stuff you wish you'd known" they are not supposed to aggro until they
reset. I've not had a problem with aggro from any trains, so it seems to be
working as planned. As you mentioned, perhaps you were close enough to the
reset area that it didn't need to reset.

I'm more than happy not to worry about trains. I can't believe anyone is
complaining about not being trained. *baffled*

Not everything on the list is correct though. It was also said that if you
sell something back to a merchant before you close the window you can get
the same amount of money you paid for it. I thought this would be a handy
way to exchange copper without going back to the bank, but it didn't work. I
only got about half of what I paid.
