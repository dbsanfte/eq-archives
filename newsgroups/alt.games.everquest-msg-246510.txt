Last I checked, you can set it to ask you whether or not to download and 
install an ActiveX program, so, you can decide each and every time 
whether or not to do so.

The difference is, you can set IE to always prompt you whether or not to 
download and install each and every ActiveX program.  Now, I will agree 
that you would have to be an idiot to configure IE to just download and 
install them, without prompting you.

Unfortunately, here at work, we are stuck with Outlook for email.
