Hi Darren,

I play on the Tribunal server and I can tell you now that the tribunal is
the best server for aussies.

There are 3 australian guilds

Aurora Noctum
Southern Legion
Crocinus Gens

There are also a stack of aussies in other US guilds. Southern Legion and
Crocinus Gens seem to be for all levels while AN is basically 60 only. The
server is not overcrowded at our times, at most there are only about 250 or
so Aussies on this server. Which seems to be the highest concentration out
of any EQ server.
