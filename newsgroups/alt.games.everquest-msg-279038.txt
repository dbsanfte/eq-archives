Unless replacing a normal bat with a nerf bat somehow made you more dangerous.

Perhaps it is a +3 vorpal nerf bat?

Or the one that Macaulay Culkin fears? http://pauldavidson.blogs.com/wfme/2004/11/drinking_coffee.html

I am amazed that people moan about the changes to some mobs in some zones. Perhaps if they want to find a challenge, 
they should try the gnolls in TS that are ++, or go in any of the dungeons, or nek forest (there's no way that that zone 
is as easy as TS, which is probably why the 'evil' population of adventurers all seems stuffed into groups in TS at that 
level. Stormhold is woefully hard to get a group in, which is a shame as they obviously did a lot of work on it. Try 
soloing there at the appropriate level, or doing the quests that make you kill 40 of the same mob solo. Ugh.

Some areas are now more accessible to soloers. However, nothing compares to the loot, xp, and number of zones available 
to groups, and it's only the pathetic feebleness of groupers that makes them want to stay still in antonica and TS and 
grind xp and never risk the dungeons.
