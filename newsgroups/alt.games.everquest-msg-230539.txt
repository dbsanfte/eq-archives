The old boring where to hunt issue.

I've been hunting Cobalt Scar as the loot is good and a quad still gets 
me 1% xp, and Dulak for fun and the XP is not bad on the right mobs.

But, is there somewhere else which would be good for solo druid to get 
1% xp per kill, without it taking forever i.e. As in Elysians!

I had been looking at Chardock as a possibility as I have never been 
there.  The entrance/exit tunnels appear doable, but is it viable or 
over-camped?

Oh and I don't want to charm hunt, I just cannot et to grips with it and 
each time I try it, PoD, I die.  I really want to get off this level as 
I am sick of it!
