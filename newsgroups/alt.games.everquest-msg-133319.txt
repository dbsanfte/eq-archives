You might wanna doublecheck that, bro... :)

/em admits that the first version of his post, he accidentally used 0.15 
instead of 1.15... :) )

Hey, that's a useful tool.  Thre's one not-quite-true (IMO) bit on the 
front page, though.  He says we can never know the trivials if they're 
above 250.  But if we try the recipe enough times at one skill level 
(say... 250. :) ) we can get a fair estimate of % chance of success.  
Then, since we know our skill level, we can back-solve the equation to get 
the item's trivial, thusly:

Trivial = (1.15*Skill level)-% Chance+70
