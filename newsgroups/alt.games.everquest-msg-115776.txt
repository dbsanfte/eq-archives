Thank
> you, Doug

Do what I did and give up on ever being friendly with them again, then kill
Sergeant Slate a few more times while watching auctions to make the NFP
pally guards more friendly.

More seriously though, the Janam and Rebby quest that Jazz mentioned, or
Left Goblin Ear turn ins in Highkeep (or the gnoll/orc scalps in Highpass,
but I still have no idea who you give them to)
