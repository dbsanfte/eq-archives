Seems to be a bug that happens to various race/classes, and in particular with
head slot gear. I was wearing a Giant Warrior's Helm for a while, and then the
Lt's Helm. I would often log in and the view showed me with no headgear at all.
Other times, it would show up as per normal. *shrug* The stats were still
there, so I didn't worry about it too much.
