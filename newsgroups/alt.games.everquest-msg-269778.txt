Interesting question. 

The main difference was that there was a mutual benefit in feudalism. 
The guy at the bottom doesn't get anything he wouldn't otherwise have 
had in what happened with AC's system.

Its like the difference between capitalisms. In one labour is strong, 
and can strike and effectively fight back against unfair working 
conditions while in others labour fails to organize and you end up with 
rich management and sweat shops.

AC I guess had been a feudal system... but whatever it was in ideal 
feudalsim that strikes a balance in the Lord / Vassal relationship was 
missing in AC. 

To fix AC they probably could have made the XP an optional tithe (that 
actually cost the vassal that XP) instead of an automatic free bonus. 
This would have put the bottom rungs in a position of 'valuing' their 
tithe, and motivated them to withold it if they felt it was being 
squandered meaninglessly and with no reciprocal benefit.

I don't know if it would have worked, but it would have been a more 
realistic model at least. If nothing else, guildies would have an 
interest in seeing a return on their investment, and if none is 
forthcoming, would cease payment.

It would be a veritable struggle to earn someones willingness to tithe 
10% xp to compensate a leader who takes time away from their own 
leveling to hang out in the lowbie areas protect, teach, and assist... 
it would be *much* harder to convince a guild of 60 to tithe 10% of 
their XP to PL some idiots alt...

I can think of even more complex systems that I think would work still 
better.
