Thanks Richard

I could not have asked for a better answer and explination. I have
probably spent 3 or 4 hours trying to do the impossible. ( I am not a
novice at trying the impossible). So, Thanks much. I am a relatively
new EQ player, Warrior 16, and so far no other chars. The added input
regarding modifing is also revealing. I'll say no more about that. 

Incidently, Whats a {a.g.e} FAQ?

Thanks again
