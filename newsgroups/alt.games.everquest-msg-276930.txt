Also the BB factions are incredibly easy to improve for a pet class, you
could run about crushbone with a macro ordering your pet to atack the
nearest orc, or even if you have a keyboard or a device that simply repeats
the keypress ad infinitum (i think mine does but i never bothered
programming it) then you could park yourself in a corner, stop eating and
drinking, read a book and let your pet do the work. If you are still at the
keyboard and able to respond to a tell, i don't think SOE would have a
problem with it, and seriously considering the abuses they don't act on,
like having one high level guy training the rockhopper cave over and over so
noone else can get flawless hides for tailoring (grrr!), i doubt they'd
notice that.

In the old days some mobs with faction (like iksar bandits) would attack
suicidally and i recall a story of a barbarian shaman who parked his toon in
a cave and came back three days later to see his faction maxed out.

Check the EULA to see if this isn't allowed, I don't have EQ1 anymore so i
can't.
