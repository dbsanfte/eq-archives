The original creator of the guild I'm in has just returned and is, um... 
rather zealous.  He has subtly hinted that he wants the guild back, and 
wants to turn it into a completely different guild (ie most of the chars 
are 1-40, he has suggested a 45+ guild).  So far, the answer has been 
"nope, sorry" but I'm a bit worried, because I seem to recall reading on 
a rant board somewhere that a guild leader left, then came back ages 
later, somehow got a GM to hand the reigns back to them since they 
created the guild, and disbanded the entire guild out of spite.  Problem 
is, now I can't find it again.  :p  I already asked on AGE and nobody 
seems to think this is possible, but, just in case - anybody ever heard 
of a case of this?
