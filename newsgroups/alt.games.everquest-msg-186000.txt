Well I have to disagree with everything people are saying here.
The books are a good thing to allow a casual play to, hold your breath, gasp
PLAY!

Yes everyone who complained that casual players could never find a group,
could never get to the place for a group now have that ability, this is a
good thing (tm).

I have a group of friends that play 1 evening a week, that's it. They have 4
hours they play and they are done, we have the ability to be any character
class/race we want now, why because we can frigin hook up in any zone
easily. We can easily buy spells by going to our home world, we don't have
to find someone to bind us at the zone where we want to hunt (or close by
anyway). We can actually startup the game and be playing in less than 10
minutes prep time. Before it was a pain in the ass, troll shaman 1 had to
run to get shaman spells, erudite necro 2 had to figure out how to get to
tox for thier spells, WE druid to gfey, ... the list goes on.

We still explore, we just do it with the ability to get back to our corpses
quickly, new zone, turn on automap and make it the 3rd one so if you die you
can see the end of the line where you died much fast CR.

No matter what is done, someone will complain. Heck sometimes the same
person who compained how hard it was for casual games is now complaining on
how easy it is to move around.
