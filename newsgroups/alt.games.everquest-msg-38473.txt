	Yes, I could, because all I would have to do is bring a lower-level friend
to actually kill the damn things.

	I could pull any mob you name, up to and including Muglwump or the King,
to the zone line to be soloed by a guildmate to whom that mob is worth EP.  I
could even buff them, and heal between fights.  And I'm just a Ranger.  A
Druid could do a MUCH better job.

	I see people doing it in the Warrens all the time.  I don't know why,
there's damned little in there that's worth anything, but they do it.
