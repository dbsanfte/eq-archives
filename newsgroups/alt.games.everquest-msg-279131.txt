The DoN progression which leads to the AA rewards starts with 3 tasks,
which each person must get an receive.  You can only get those tasks when
indifferent to the relevant camp, and when are you are level 65+.

Once you have completed those single tasks, you need a group with an
average level of 68+ to get the single group mission.

Any average lower than that will prevent you from obtaining the mission and
will halt your progression.

So you must be 65+, you must be indifferent, and you must be able to field
a group of average level 68+ to really start the progression in a
meaningful way.
