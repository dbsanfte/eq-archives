The point in tradeskills is that your create items that you sell to players,
not the vendors. Only fishing and tailoring will actually be profitable when
selling to merchants, and those yield not much. Both also require
non-buyable things, so progress is dependant of your surroundings.

You being an Enchanter I suggest you go for jewelry. It takes quite a lot of
plat in the beginning, but starts getting profitable when you can make items
players need (like +stat rings, int and wis are about the most popular, and
the +hp/+mana bracelets). Just make sure you stick to the trivial tables or
you will go through your money at an alarming rate.

Afaik, jewelry only checks for int or wis (highest of the two) when making
it. Smithing (the second best tradeskill imo) also checks for strength and I
assume you don't have much of that.

As a last note: Baking is getting more popular with the new stat increases
baked items give. It requires very little money to get your skill to 135 or
so and a lot of ingredients can simply be bought from stores. Not sure about
the making money bit though.
