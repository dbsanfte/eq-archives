Certain zones require you to have passed some test to gain entrance, 
usually very high level zones.  Passing said tests puts a 'flag' on your 
character file (sets a variable) that tells the game you are allowed 
into that zone now.

FD means Feign Death, an innate class ability of monks, and a spell for 
Shadowknights and Necromancers.  Feign death allows you to appear to be 
dead, making the critters ignore you. A good feign death check will mean 
that even once you stand up the critters no longer remember they hate 
you... on a semi-good check, they ignore you while down, but when you 
stand they come charging back. Often used to pull single mobs out of a 
camp by seperating them from the bunch.

One of the the trickiest parts of other people dealing with Feign death 
is that a spell cast on a monk while still standing, that lands after he 
falls over apparently dead breaks the effect, and gets him pounded, and 
if you just buffed or healed him, gets you agro as well.
