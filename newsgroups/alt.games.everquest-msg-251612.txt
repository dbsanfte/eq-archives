Thanks to all who responded. Unfortunately, I've no idea if I saw all the
responses or not, as our news server was cut off for a few days. Anyway, my
friend has now quit EQ; I'm going to stick around for a while (but will
reroll, as I've no desire to play my character anymore without his IC
brother around). I think Neverwinter Nights is where we're going to end up
playing together.

Thanks again. :)
