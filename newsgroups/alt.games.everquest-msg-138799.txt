From a DirectX coders perspective:

When you minimize a full screen app, it lets go of all its video ram.  This
causes all textures and images to be lost.  So, when the app regains focus,
you have to reload all the graphics back.  This turns out to be a boatload
of work, maintaining all the information about an image so you can reload it
when you need it.

The thing is, they already have it in place =)  If you change the
resolution, the video memory is scrapped (new dimensions on arrays), so its
all reloaded anyway.  So, the "hack fix" would be to put a ChangeResolution
call to change to the current resolution (to force a reload) whenever the
program regains focus.

Granted its a bit more involved, but nothing that would require a serious
rewrite
