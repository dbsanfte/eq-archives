Thats what cancel magic does.   Generally it is not useful for getting debuffs
or DoT's off of yourself, since it will strip you of your beneficial buffs in
the process.  It can however be used on mobs as well.   These spiders are a
good example of a place where it is useful.   Immediately upon spawning, they
buff themselves with SoW and damage shields.   If you cancel magic on them a
few times, you can get rid of both of those.   And if you have a tank swinging
a fast weapon in your party, you can end up saving him a significant amount of
damage for relativley little mana.
