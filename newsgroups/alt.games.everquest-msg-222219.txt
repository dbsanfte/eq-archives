The "porting between wayfarer camps" bit is the most useful aspect.  Talk
to the magus in the camp, tell him/her your desired destination, and *POOF*
you're there. As convenient as pok books, but they only cycle you through
the 5 camps. And it did give my evil dudes a more convenient way into
everfrost plains. Also note that you don't have to have the stone with
you to do this -- it can be attached to a charm, or in the bank. For all
I know, it works like a flag and you can use maguses even if you've
destroyed it...

Well, you can purchase charms from the adventure merchants for
1-6 adventure points, if you like. These charms only grant bonuses
in dungeons, but it's better than nothing. And in any event, you
can always ask for another adventurer stone if a better charm comes
along.
