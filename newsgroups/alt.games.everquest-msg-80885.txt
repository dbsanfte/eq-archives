I'd say no. Its a gimmick that is very expensive yet will only be of
use to you in the old world on mobs which are camped a lot of the time
and are no where near as good of experience as some newer area mobs. 

You'd probably do far better as a druid in an area like dawnshroud
with nearly unlimited mobs at level 35 plus since it seems like a very
good area as far as xp goes. Or you could get a manastone and ask if
all the dwarves in butcher are camped and often hear "yes." A bad
effect of the stone will be that you don't feel you can go check out
those areas so you stay in boring land.

I'd hardly have any use for one if it was given to me free.
