Hehe, i have to be /roleplay to aviod the most sow/buff/pl/port request, that
helps a little. At least now only people who can see me ask for anything.

Hehe, i run a never help/trade/port list too, and got to use it yesterday.
2 days ago, some level 1 idiot in GFay (Sinvarias) was calling everyone names,
went on for around half hour, untill i started talking about petitioning him.
30 sec later i get a tell from another guy (Sindvarias) saying hes a GM and
are on the case.
Rather stupid thing to do when youre even in the zone, so people can see you
are not a GM.
So reported him for impersonating a GM, and the other guy for general
harassment of whole zone.
Then yesterday im passing through GFay selling my stuff, including FierDal
cultural boots. Then a thirth guy (Sinvariase) ask if he can buy them. Hes
level 3 ranger, so looks a lot like a new char for that idiot from the day
before, so tell him im not selling to him due to behaviour problems.
He start bitching a little, and tell me hes just gonna buy them from another
vendor. Hehe, just too bad there are to my knowledge only 3 wood elf tailors
who can make it on Veeshan server: Me, some guy i havent seen for 4 months
now, and a guy with 146 skill thats working on it.
Its stuff like that that make this game worth playing.
