Don't remember what level, but I could take him when blue. You're
right if ensare doesn't stick he comes at you fast. Tactic was to
first cast ensare at max distance. If resisted you are probably going
to take some damage--just keep re-casting until it sticks. (regen
helps).  Then I would either root-dot or fear-dot. Watch when root or
fear beak, he flies fast even snared.

Safer tactic would be to charm a Griffene/Griffawn to occupy him until
you can stick ensnare. Don't bother buffing your pet, it won't last
too long.
