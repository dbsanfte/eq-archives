I've played EQ1 for a long time and am making the migration to EQ2 at
the behest of my wife.  I find myself confused by some aspects of EQ2
that simply work completely differently than EQ1, such as mana regen.
Seems like sometimes my mage casts and casts and casts, and finishes
the fight full mana, other times I glance at his mana bar a minute or
two after fighting is done and he's way down.  

Anyone know any good sites that go into this sort of game mechanics?
Health regen, mana regen, proper way to do heroic opportunities in a
group, that sort of stuff?  I've kind of resisted doing a lot of
"outside reading" on EQ2 because I find it MUCH more fun and immersive
to find stuff out in-game, but I think I'm at the point where I could
use a few pointers.
