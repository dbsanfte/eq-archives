What I'm most worried about is my little Darkelf SK, a long time ago he was
wandering in the trolls swamp only to stumble across the "Troll-slayer" now
I read this as "The slayer of trolls" and being the kind hearted soul I am I
whooped his sorry butt, only to take a *HUGE* hit to my Troll DaBasher
faction, it seems the Troll-slayer is a guard =)

So does this mean every time my SK wanders back the neiak to
bank/sell/smith/train I'm going to have to Invis myself through the city ?

*Sigh* I guess 42 Levels isnt than much to redo =(
