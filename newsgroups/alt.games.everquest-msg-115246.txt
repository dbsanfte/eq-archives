I think, from experience, the best way to get buffs is to hang around
looking pathetic.  Some people just can't bear to watch a fight go on for
more than, say, ten minutes without feeling inclined to start buffing you.
:o)

The only problem then is that, as a reasonably feeble dark elf rogue, I've
got very little I can do in return except bow and say thanks.  I don't know
about anyone else, but buffs - much as I appreciate them - tend to make me
feel guilty.
