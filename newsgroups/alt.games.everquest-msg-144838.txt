I'm running 98SE on an Intel 600 (runs fine under old-style graphics), and
XP on an Intel 1.6... both are very stable.

I'd go with XP, myself...

Direct X 9.0 is due in the next 2-3 months... and if 9.0 offers better
graphics tools than 8.0a/8.1 (what EQ uses now) then VI might switch up
(like they did for 7.0 around Kunarks release, and again for 8.0a for
Luclin). If that happens, you might have wished you'd gone with XP, just
because it MIGHT be easier to get the needed hardware drivers.
