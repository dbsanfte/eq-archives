I was going to bring up this point myself.  My lvl26 druid does the
snare/dot/lvl24root method to get 100% effect on the dot.  I then med while
doing sneak/hide combo (halfling) to avoid passing mobs.  I guess I'm lazy
and like to play it safe.

When the root wears off, I back up and re-root....repeat.  When the mob is
near death, I usually melee to finish the job.

Against animal mobs, there is no question ...use fear-kiting.
