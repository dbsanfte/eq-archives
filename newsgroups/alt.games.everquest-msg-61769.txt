The only one that doesn't drop anymore is the manastone, which used to come
from the EE in Lguk, it was an instant right click inventory item that
swapped hp for mana (like a shaman, but much faster)...it was removed
because clerics could combine it with CH to get their mana back insanely
fast. Plus the camp at the EE for the things was ridiculous.

There are a number of flowing thought items in the game...the 7th (and
presumably 8-10th) coldain shawls, the boots you get from yelinak for
killing Tormax, several NToV items, an earring from Tunare, several drops
from Cazic-Thule (the god, not the zone), and others. It isn't a common
ability, because it can be quite strong (the earring from tunare is flowing
thought III, which means +3 mana/tick, or 30 extra mana a minute). People
who parse the sp.dat file have said that flowing thought goes all the way
up to version X....I doubt that will ever be seen in-game...100 mana/minute
extra would be madness (plus, I would really hate to see the difficulty of
the mob THAT item dropped off).
