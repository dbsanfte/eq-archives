I very much doubt that encouraging guard killing was the reason.   In fact,
the reason the guards are so overpowered is because they couldn't get people
to stop killing them, back in the day.   They didn't used to be nearly as
bad as they are now.

IMO, the 100 ZEM as a "standard city bonus" is because of the newbie areas
that are usually located in those zones.  To encourage hunting there.
