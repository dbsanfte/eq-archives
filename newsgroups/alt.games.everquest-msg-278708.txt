Now you're arguing about useless spells.  Completely different argument, and
not a very good basis to argue that spells aren't "loot".  Wanna know how
many times I've spent "points" to get an item and ended up spending yet more
points to upgrade that item the very next week?  Due to my playstyle, far
more than I should have.   =)

You're also speaking from a perspective that really doesn't make much sense
to me.  Anybody who is level 70 can buy half a dozen blades of carnage and
have money left over, or should be able to at least.  The non-raiders should
have even more money, in spite of needing to spend more.  I don't get much
time to grind (and don't care for grinding anyway, thus my playstyle
choice).  But I know how much money I can make when I grind, so I know how
much money every other level 70 has had and still has the opportunity to
make.

I have two twinks with BoCs.  One is a ranger.  =P

The other reason your perspective doesn't make much sense to me is that
casters simply *don't go* to the rune-dropping spots to grind.  There can't
be a great deal of demand.  I know this because I've lamented the lack of an
enchanter, druid, cleric, shaman while trying to get one of my rare grind
sessions in these spots, while seeing half a dozen of them lfg in WoS.
