  I just rolled up a troll BL that I will probably make as my
main alt when on FV or on Tealtar... If the petition doesn't work
out, I can take the name you want, then you an marry her
(Teajust) when she hits twenty.  Can't do this with Tealtar,
because she has the Surname Oogrog, and is in spirit married to
Lenny on that server... Though not in realty.  If you can't stand
the idea of being married to a troll, you can marry Tealtar, you
take the name of Oogrog, then we can have a hugh falling out when
you find out that I'm I drunken slut, or.. if you prefer, I found
out about you collection of armless barbie dolls, and we can a
divorce and you tearful petition that the name Oogrog only brings
you pain now.

   Yes, it will probably be quicker to just /petition.  But my
way is more fun.

Annie
