To be fair, maybe they should do a /ran 32000 for everyone for downtime.
I'm fairly sure they have records showing what hours every account plays.
So whoever wins, they take that players least likely time.  That way the
majority would most likely get the least downtime, but the minority would
not *always* get the shaft.  Might be hard on the workers having to come in
all hours tho.
