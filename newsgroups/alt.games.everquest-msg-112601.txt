I am looking, no BEGGING :), for help please....

I recently upgraded my hardware and have not been able to play EQ since. I
am currently in contact with the techies at EQ Tech but I'm not sure they
can help me any more. The last email asked me to get my ISP to check the
connections based on the traceroutes both they and I have done. However EQ
Tech (and myself) doubt this is the issue as everything was fine up to the
hardware change.

Current system:

Win2K OS with SP2
Abit KR7A-133 Motherboard
Athlon 1800+XP CPU
256MB DDR memory
Maxtor 40GB HDD
Maxtor 15GB HDD
Creative SB Live! Sound card with Creative 3509.1.0.0 driver
Pny Geforce 2 MX 200 32MB AGP card with NVIDIA 2.8.3.2 driver
DirectX 8.1

I use the BT Openworld anytime ISDN service (in the UK) to connect to the
internet.

Problems:

Firstly - logging in to the EQ server
When I try to connect to the log in server the screen freezes and after
about 15 -20secs the Error 1001 dialog box appears telling me that I should
try again later. What may be important is that the line 'Status: connecting
to etc' does not appear until exactly the same time as the Error 1001 dialog
appears. Also if I retry to connect to the log in server after this, the
Error 1001 dialog immediately appears along with the previously mentioned
status line message - no delay
(If the game was working fine this line appears immediately I try to connect
to the log in server and is followed by the server selection screen)

Secondly - disconnection
Occasionally if I manage to get passed the server login, I get all the way
to the character selection screen. At this point I select the character I
want, the screen then goes black for a short time and then I get the message
'you have been disconnected' appearing.


I am currently at a complete loss as to what to do now. Below is a list of
things I have tried

1. Install Via 4 in 1 drivers for MB
2. Stopped all non essential processes - used www.blkviper.com as a resource
3. Have minimal processes running in the task manager
4. Tried different drivers for graphics card and Sound card
5. Tried tweaking the internet conection settings and resetting to default
6. complete reinstallation of EQ and all the expansions


This is driving me nuts! I must have spent about 70hrs in the last 10 days
trying to figure this out without anything like success. If anyone can give
me a clue you will make a fustrated EQ player VERY happy ( and give him back
his sanity )

Thanks
