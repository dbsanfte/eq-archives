I noticed the replies of others... standing up to Clerics is unheard of on
Tunare. (At least I've never seen anyone walk away from it in one piece.)

Sort of... but I'm not forcing them and I ask politely. If they're busy, not
a problem... I don't hassle them for it. Respect works both ways. If a
Cleric turns me down "Okay, thanks for your time then. Good luck." is my
response. -Unless they think they're something special and decide to be rude
to me about it.

I'm a weird person... if someone is doing something for me and they
personally do not expect payment I will go out of my way to be thankful to
them, make it as convenient as possible, and keep them comfortable while
helping me.

On the other hand, if someone is charging me for their time and effort, I
will only do the minimum needed.

I understand where you're coming from, and I understand that few, if anyone,
think like I do (or are anywhere near as stubborn as I). However, I
personally do not spend their mana. They opt to. And if they only want to
help me for financial gain, I will treat them in a business-like manner. If
they want to help me because they're nice, I will treat them as a friend.
Hopefully I worded things better than I have in the past...
