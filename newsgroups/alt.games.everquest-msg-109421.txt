I don't understand why some people get upset when a thread has
provoked a little civilized debate.  I enjoy reading a good debate and
(as is I suppose obvious by now) enjoy participating in one as well.
As long as the participants are reasonably courteous to each other, I
see nothing at all wrong with it.  In fact I think these threads are a
contribution to a newsgroup.

But if you disagree or are bored with the particular subject of the
thread, don't read the thread.  Simple :)
