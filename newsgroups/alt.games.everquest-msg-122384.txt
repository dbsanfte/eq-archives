Some things in Luclin seem to not obey this rule (go figure, level 35
summoning...), I was feigned in Paludal Caverns after a bad pull (3 Phlerg
Phlargs), I feigned while Jabobtik fought rear guard, I hadn't dotted any of
them, but they killed Jabobtik and started wandering off, I stood up well
out of agro range, and 2 of them turned around and started running for me,
ended up channeling another FD through with about 25% health.
