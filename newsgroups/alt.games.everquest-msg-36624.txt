Yeah, well, I agree. At least translocates are cool though :).

A side-issue on evacs: Can you actually get left behind by your own evac?
I've never left anyone behind on a port (which I seem to recall also have a
small chance of leaving someone behind), and the only time I've missed a
couple with an evac was because they were out of range running from Ry'Gorr
Avengers in EW.

Yes, I was talking about the specific case where someone rather essential to
the majority of the group surviving is about to die (which obviously depends
on the situation, but usually the cleric). This is a once-in-a-blue-moon
situation, of course - it'd be pretty rare for you to even think about doing
this unless in a situation where you had a rez-capable cleric, couldn't evac
(due to level or location), and the tank(s) couldn't get the mob off the
cleric. You're probably all going to die anyway, but you never know.

At L10 though, melee might still be a viable (although obviously not
preferred) option for a pure caster. You may be pretty awful at it, but it's
not instant (or near-instant) death like at later levels, and you can
actually cause a bit of damage. Only if you are full mana though, else
medding is probably more productive.

Unless they changed it in a recent patch, you get the message from the
highest level (or maybe just the most recent) DS, but Flickering Flame does
stack with mage and druid DSs in terms of damage (or so the tanks tell me).
5 damage is of course pretty damn awful for the level you get it let alone
later, but every little helps.
