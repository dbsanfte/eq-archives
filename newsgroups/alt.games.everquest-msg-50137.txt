Not only how awfully laggy it still is, but on other features like
characters and monsters.  They give you same feel of 'likeness' as in
Asheron's Call, where the monsters are different, but shades:)

Also, and this really makes me pissed off, this is the first title released
by the Garriott brothers(they started Ultima titles waaaaaaayy back, and
started Ultima Online)...so, this was a huge disappointment in my eyes.

I know you can get, what, a five day free account, or a week..cannot
remember exactly.

Also, I beleive it's 14.95 per month as well:(

Save your money and play Dark Ages of Camelot....especially if you like
working for skill, and have a good time playing in a group of others.

Hasta!
