they are a lot harder to get

they often are versions of the spells with extra oomf to them

the enchanter nukes are for more damage, and the mezzes last longer

the mage nukes are more damage and less mana (i think), etc

the cleric buff(s) = more duration, i think less pdot cost

so they're very very handy spells, but they only come from raid
encounters -- boss mobs of velious, luclin, and gates
