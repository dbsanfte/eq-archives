It wasn't sitting on your ass on the boats that was the problem.  It was
getting on and getting off.  At least when you are on the boat, you *can* go
make that sandwich.  Sitting at the dock waiting for the boat sucked.

I did eventually discover a trick for that.  If you levitate past the end of
the dock, where the boat will stop, when the boat comes by it picks you up.
So, if you have a levitate with a long enough duration, you can automate
getting on the boat, at least.
