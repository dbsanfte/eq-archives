they did add the option that tells you where the boats are.  personally I
have never got thrown out of the boat before I wanted to. I have gone LD on
the boat, that was pretty scary, but ended up being zoned to one port side
or another.  I remember doing a petition once because of the boat problem I
had and getting what I needed resolved quickly enough.

Luclin is a better way to go for travel.  although if someone has the
capability to port you to luclin, (or a place to get to luclin), you could
probably have them port you directly to where you wanna go anyhows.

Binding at Luclin for mobility purposes also seems pretty kewl.  Would free
you up from not being a Porter in the first place.  basically you have a
central location where you can pick which continent you wanna jump to, as I
understand it.  I'm not exact on specifics though because my comp just
cannot cover Luclin yet, although my payed upgrade is coming.  :)
