Lots and lots of harvesting.  I have found a total of 4 rares so far, one 
copper, one silver, on severed bone, and one palladium.  I made an adept 
3 ward spell for myself from the silver, had a palladium torque made form 
the palladium by a friend who has an alt woodworker that I gave the 
severed bone to, and I sold the copper for several gold.  Currently I am 
in my 130s in all of the harvesting skills to give you an idea how much 
harvesting I have done.
