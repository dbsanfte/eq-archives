Speaking only for Vallon Zek here, but yes, there is a difference in how
PC's con to each other. On Vallon ( where you must be within 8 levels of a
PC to engage in PvP ) PC's con either green ( 9+ Levels below you ) White
( within 8 levles of you ) or Red ( 9+ levels above you ). Also, you must be
level 6 or greater in order to be PvP'd at all.

One of the more suprising aspects of playing on a non PvP server for idle
entertainment was when I conned a PC and it gave me a Blue Con message.
Hadda check twice to make sure I wasnt looking at an NPC. :)
