I'm about to ding 57, and I can't see any compelling reason to use Forlorn
Deeds over Shiftless Deeds.  Here's my reasoning (I have no idea how these
scale above 60):

Tepid Deeds:  Level 24, 100 mana, 50% slow at level 60.
Shiftless Deeds:  Level 44, 200 mana, 65% slow at level 60.
Forlorn Deeds:  Level 57, 225 mana, 70% slow at level 60.

Now 25 mana isn't a lot, but it would add up over time.  Shiftless and
Forlorn both have the same duration and same cast time, so those aren't a
consideration.  I guess the question is:  Is 5% really a big enough
difference to justify using more mana?
