Let's get one thing straight here.  I do not "hate" KEI.  I am
irritated that SOE has not yet fixed the stupid hole in the post-50
buff restrictions that is routinely exploited to buff non-qualifying
characters with certain group buffs, KEI included.  And I deplore
the huge negative effect I've seen KEI have on my favorite part of
EQ:  the under 50 game.

As for the "vocal, but tiny minority", the mere fact that there are
few who complain hardly demonstrates that there are few who dislike
it.  Personally, I get the sense that the "KEI for lowbies" lovers
are themselves a rather small minority, and most players have no
strong opinion either way.
