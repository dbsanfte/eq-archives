it never fails.......

zone into Rivervale and theres one of them little shits begging for money
for spells.... so I'd do one of two things:

1. give them a fishing pole to earn their own money (which they couldnt sell
but for a few silver)
2. tell them i'd give them a few pp for a stack of batwings (to this day,
none have accomplished this feat)

what i'd really like to do is port them to Iceclad and camp

I'm not mean, i'm just drawn that way
