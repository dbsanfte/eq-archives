If this is indeed true, then it can become a major problem.  It is not 
difficult to fail on some of the steps, and be forced to repeat them.  I 
had to do the test of patience 3 times before I got it done, as the killer 
sharks saw through my invis to animals, and, at my level at the time, 
staying there with them was not an option.
