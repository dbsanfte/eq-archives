Ok, you're first definition would be an upgrade for a paladin.  Druids, on
the other hand, can get good xp from soloing, even with a minimal amout of
downtime.  Remember, four blues is three more than a pally can take on, and
you have a much better chance of surviving them.  Sure, you may not be as
good a soloer as a necro, but a druid is a far cry better than -every- other
class.
