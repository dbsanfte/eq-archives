Hah hah, good on me, I didn't know jump canceled!

I spent my first couple years using sit to cancel and then
they inexplicably nerfed that, so I moved to duck.  Duck
is a pain in the butt though, since sometimes you miss the
second duck and can't cast cause you are in bad position.

I'll try jump instead and see how it does, if it works I'd never
get that out of position message again.  Hmm, but I've
noticed I can't jump with levitate on, and 90% of my life
now I have SOE... so that will be a problem unless for
some reason it still cancels.

I have a social key set up:

/ttell rezing one of your bodies when you arive, target me, assist, and type
/loot

This way we don't get any accidents with people looting unrezed
bodies on arrival, by assisting me they get the one that I just rezed,
and by using /loot instead of clicking to loot, they can't make any
mistakes.

Having them loot the rezed bodies means I don't make any mistakes
by re-selecting the same corpse and rezing it again, although this
is less of a problem now that I (and every other two bit cleric
over 50) have my epic.
