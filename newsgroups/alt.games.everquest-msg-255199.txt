Quote Moopy:
"What I liked from EQ play nice was not the
ability to set 'max FPS' but to set 'max background FPS'. In
other words, when you're not focused don't render 3d"

Two-boxing wasn't discussed in this part of the thread, we were discussing
lowering CPU usage while EQ runs in the background. That's what you replied
to. That's what I responded to. You can still do that with EQPN without
having to pay for it.

Oh, and making fun of someone when you're wrong just makes you look utterly
stupid.
