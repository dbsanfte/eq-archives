> All Vendor fodder.

Except for the Gnoll Hide Lariat. I used to buy any I saw in the baz vendors
for below 10pp when I used to play the Chimp often. Of course more wealthy
characters may pay more but I never had trouble keeping 2 on me and a few
banked and not paying more than 10pp so I can't imagine they would be worth
too much more.

That was on Stormhammer BTW - haven't played a pet class since leaving
there.

Having a couple of these to give your pet when fighting difficult caster
mobs can make a crucial difference at times.
