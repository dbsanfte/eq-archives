As far as i have figured having a higher dmg in mainhand is best for
the backstabs, but as you said doing much dmg can make me dead :)

My plan was to use that steel dirk in offhand and netherbian or BSF in
main hand, think i do okey now for a lvl 11, my backstab is max 37 or
was it 38 anyway think that is nice, normal dmg is max 17, can solo
even con mammoth calfs :)
