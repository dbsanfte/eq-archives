Its been stated on the offical board that mobs have random stats when
they are spawned or "born".  Pets included. Slight differences in the
range of the stats will impact the results. And since can't use same
pets over and over, its impossible to prove. 

But I'm convinced that giving phantom plate to a level 44 water pet
helps him. A lot.  I hunt in tenebough mountains, I can kill wolves
and bats without phantom plate, but the pet will be done with 20% and
sometimes so low the mob won't even run when almost dead!!  I'll
either have to melee or heal pet to get mob to run away.  With phantom
plate pet can tank whole time and end fight with 40%, with no heals
and only one cinder bolt.

I've done it numorous times, same pet. Gets beat down, give him the
plate (and a coldstones, 3 symbol daggers and 2 rings of flight),
adding about 102 AC, and he's tanking like a champ.

No question in my mind.
