I know necros outDPS my shaman easilly, and I can sustain better than 
150DPS while soloing.  Once I get my AA to cast from HP, and my level 70 
heal over time, I will be able to sustain even more than that.  Not to 
mention, I still need critical affliction 2 and 3, and a burning 
affliction 5 item.
