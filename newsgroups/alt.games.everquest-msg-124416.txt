I'm wondering if people exploit the pathing in SG on most servers.  On TM,
there is a crew of people 'sploiting the bottom of the well, and also the
room under the priestess temple (where you swim to under water) as well as
Fellspine.  I've petitioned this over and over, but I've come to the
conclusion that VI simply doesn't care, because these people are there
basically day and night.
