To be sure, but I never said damage bonuses weren't relevant. :)

For classes with dmg bonuses you would surely want to look at 
dmg+bonus... but dmg+bonus = dmg from a certain point of view.

(ie if I were implementing weapons I'd probably have a 'damage' property 
that simply returned the correct damage (including the bonus if 
applicable, and it would likely include bane and poison (etc) damage too) :)
