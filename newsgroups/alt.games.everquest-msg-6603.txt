1)  How do resists work? Do mobs of a level higher than you resist very often?
    I find that everything higher up in the Field of Bone Pit in Kurnak resist
    my spells very often. Is this just related to my low level (7) or do
    they in general resist if higher than you? Is it my ability in the
    spells group (Divination etc). That would mean that all mobs you hunt in
    groups constantly resist, as they tend to be red's.

2) Can somebody provide an *accurate* list of what to hunt in Kurnak at
   any given level? Not 'windmill' or 'fort', but 'Xyz Skeletons in Barfoo'
   and 'Teletubbies in Lower Babysphere' etc - you get it. I'm just a
   lazy powerleveller cause I want to get up and then wander the world.
   
3) Any suggestions on what items to get? Maybe more the available ones
   instead of hyped superultratotal rare things. For once I'd like
   a black flowing robe for looks :) I know .. Najana in Najana.
