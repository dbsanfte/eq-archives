I believe around level 52... i know that if your above level 52 and hit one
of them, you get ported out of the lare - meaning you can't do any damage -
you can try and heal lower level guildies though till you get agrod.

Lets get it right, i got flamed first.  Fight fire with fire and all that.

I didn't post say shit to anybody until somebody made a personal attack on
me, and if I try to reinforce my claims due to my characters/personal
experiences Im suddenly "uber and thinking im better then everybody else"
get real.

If i came here to start shit, dya really think I'd post using my full name?

Im sorry you don't like my take no shit attitude, but you will just have to
live with it.  Read through any other post in here, I've tried to answer
questions for people when I could, and not started any personal attacks on
people, the latter is more then can be said for some people here.
