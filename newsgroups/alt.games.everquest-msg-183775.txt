It's typical of Verant to use a heavy hand and totally nerf the experience
of this quest.  Instead they could have reduced the experience gain by half
or quarter, then seen how many people were still doing it.

It seems their idea of a successful quest is one no one wants to do.   In
that case they have a huge amount of successful quests in the game.   Makes
you wonder why they even bother?
