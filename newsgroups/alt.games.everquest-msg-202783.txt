You'd have to read the posts (and wade through some really crappy
stuff) but I'll summarize our worries about the this pet -

1.  It is apparently designed for burst DPS, with IC and a small
mana pool, but we believe mages will get around this by reclaiming
and resummoning anytime he goes OOM, giving us a resounding boost
to long term DPS.

2.  AE's.  Root.  Given the level of SOE's AI we REALLY don't like
these being on it.

Many of us want a pet that

1.  ONLY CASTS - like Servant of Ro, when you /pet kill it should
stop dead and nuke from that range and NEVER MELEE (fire pet melee
BITES)

2.  Casts a pair of spells designed particularly for it with their
cast time/resist modifier/damage geared to around 80DPS on mobs with
average resists (higher than air, but it can't tank at all, lower than
water, but you don't have to position).

These should be Fire/Magic (in keeping with our spell selection).

This pet would have no push and be able to do consistent damage from
outside shorter ae ranges, making them more liveable in raids.


We (most of us) don't want an upgraded variant of the 49 firepet, as
we come pretty close to that with 61 air (good hp/ac) with Flameshield
of Ro on it.  Make anything better than that with the DS being innate
and too many mages would REALLY scream about obsoleting the epic.
 
Anyway - that's just scratching the surface of our thoughts on the
matter.

I can say with authority that most of us do not want IC on it if that's
gonna cause such bad feelings with another class.

Umm, didn't work that way at 3:30PST, I had my xp set to regular
xp (I'm still making up that death loop) and I got an AA point.

Yeah, the charms for you folks who have put in the huge time and effort
to be elemental flags is pretty close to appropriate.

What flags are those specifically James?

PoS/PoV
HoH
CoD
BoT
HoHB

are all seperate
are Fire/Water/Earth/Air all seperate
flags or one big flag?  Do mini-boss
flags count as seperate flags?  

I haven't seen the numbers on how  many
times a person with your flags can get
a response from the NPC when you say 
"I have stories"
