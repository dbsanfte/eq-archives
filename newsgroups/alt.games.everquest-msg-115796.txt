Okay, back to the subject:

- Porting does not cost druids money.

- Porting costs time -- about 2 to 5 minutes.

- Porting costs mana -- the amount tops out at about 300 mana for druids.

- Regenerating 300 mana takes time.

All of these things are true, and I won't dispute any of them.  Arguing with
me that these things are true is a waste of breath.

My point is:

- Donations are GIFTS.  http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=donation

- Unless you've told the person you're porting that you expect a certain
amount, be grateful for what you are freely given.  Blaming that person for
not reading your mind is stupid, and being a jerk to them for not reading
your mind is both stupid and mean.

- An insult is something intentionally done to hurt your feelings/make you
angry.  Someone who does not know your expectations regarding your donations
is not insulting you by giving you less than you expect.  Acting as if he
has is silly.

- If your time is so valuable to you that you don't want to spend five of it
porting someone for less than a certain amount, don't offer to port for
donations.  Port for a flat fee, and make sure that everyone who comes to
you for a port knows what it is.

- Frankly, it's unfair to everyone to port "for donations" with
expectations.  Chances are you and your passenger will end up cranky.  You
because you didn't get what you should have had the presence of mind to ask
for, and your passenger when you call his mother a froglok for "insulting"
you.
