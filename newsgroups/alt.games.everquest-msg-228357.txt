This isn't exactly proof but there has been a difference in bazaar items
since the announcement was made. I've been told more high end items are
being sold. I personally have been tracking ornate items and over a three
day period after the announcement more and more ornate items appeared. It
has leveled out at about 25 to 30 items up for sale at any given time now as
opposed to the 5 to 10 prior to the announcement.
