I have started all my char's. in GFay. The CB belts are a nice way to
build up plat/xp, but I will say that CB is THE MOST aggravating zone
when it comes to KSing, ninja-looting and downright rudeness I have
experienced thusfar. I try to level past it ASAP so I can move on.
Sadly, now Oasis is becoming very similar.

I hope there is some level that tends to start weeding out the jerks
either due to their loss of interest or lack of ability to find anyone
who will group with them for their reputation. Anyone know?
