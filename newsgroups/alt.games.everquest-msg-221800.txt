Ahh, it is proberly just a sign of my rough tactics that I rely on it a fair
bit. In outdoor areas where there are a few to many adds for fear kiting, to
avoid the pet getting spanked I will turn off the pet's taunt and get the
mob mad as hell at me instead and just keep out of reach, stopping to
reapply dots etc. Any extra speed means shorter distance needed to run
before stopping to cast and hence smaller overall area needed.
