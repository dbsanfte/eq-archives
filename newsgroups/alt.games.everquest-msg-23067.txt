As he waited 30secs before looting I'd say it was a genuine mistake. The
correct thing for him to do would be to have right clicked on the item and
then, upon seeing it as no drop, ask for a roll on it. He didn't do it, that
could just be inexperience.

A petition won't help you, training him for it?

Example post;

"I am relatively new to the game and while clearing up the corpses that were
lying around (and messing up my targetting on mobs) I looted a no drop
earring, it was an accident.
Since then, this dickhead monk who was in the party keeps using Feign Death
the pull trains on me, I've died on several occasions for this and nearly
lost my level.
What should I do?"

You get the picture. Would one train satisfy you for revenge? Two? A lost
level? A player so sick of the attitude of others over a mistake he quits
the game?

He may looted this on purpose after seeing the item but you can't prove that
or do anything about it.
Personally, I'd be aggrieved as well and be cautious about grouping with
him, although I'd prolly give him the benefit of the doubt but if another
"mistake" happened I'd just stay clear of him.
