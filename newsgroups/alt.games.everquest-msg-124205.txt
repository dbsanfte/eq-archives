It was my understanding that off-hand weapon attacks were based on the
main-hand weapon speed, so if you have a slow main-hand weapon, then the
off-hand will attack only as fast as the main hand?

If that is the case then wouldn't you want the main-hand to be the fastest?

I do understand what you are saying about the damage bonus, but again if the
main-hand is slower isn't this causing a problem?
