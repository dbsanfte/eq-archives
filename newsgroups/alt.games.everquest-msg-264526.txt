And they are the ones who powerleveled up there with (usually) no regard to 
enjoying most the game content, and are still looking for/whining for that 
elusive 'content', which they will never see with their leveling blinders

uber armor and weapons fighting a dragon. And the developers wind up 
catering to them.
