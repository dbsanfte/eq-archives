Lesa, look, forget it, will ya??  No offence, but I just got done banging
out a post where you were twisting up all sorts of stuff, and not clear,
and I don't mean this to be a personal jab or anything, but in order to
command such clairity, you are gonna have to be that way yourself to
a more noticable level.

Well, for starters, you are "tring" (real hard at that) to make him look
like he is not answering you when in fact he has, both indirectly, implied,
*and* directly (much like the angle/approach you have used).  And at
"minimual", not only has that set him up for ridicule, you are going
on to even "supply" the ridicule in a condensending fashion.  This
particular micro-thread need not be replied to - just something for
you to think about - we really need to get back to discussing the
whole gay behaviour thing, and the falicy that it is an "attribute".
