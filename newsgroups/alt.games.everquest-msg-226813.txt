I use the Ignore list for this.  It doesn't have any comments, which 
means people who are on the list for the crime of stealing from my camp 
in paladul are ranked just the same as those who spammed POK or those 
who really messed up in an LDoN like this guy.  It would be handy if I 
could differentiate them, but I haven't got that good a memory, 
basically, if they are on the ignore list I try to avoid them.

My friends list is much more helpful, its populated exclusively with 
people who I enjoyed playing with and who were good players.  I still 
don't remember who half of them are, but if any of them are LFG and in 
my level range they are my first choice, I'm very rarely dissapointed in 
rediscovering someone at 55 who it turns out was a good partner back 
when I was 26 in Marus Seru.

Hey, isn't there an option in the LFG tool to exclude people who are on 
your ignore list?  Just occured to me.

Splendid
