Simply amazing. While I can't get my two remaining brain cells to cough 
up what they were, I know that I had four solid pages of hot keys that I 
used in various situations. (e.g. soloing/quadding, groups, and raids.) 
By the time I left, for the higher end PoP raids, I had two pages alone 
of hot keys I used in various situations just to keep up when the action 
got fast. Granted, I only used a few when soloing. I think I got really 
lazy, and even had some keys set up for stupid things like swapping my 
Jumpy robe out for my manarobe while I was medding up. And yes, like you 
I had my Staff of the Four and my bridle hotkeyed as well.
