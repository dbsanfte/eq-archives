As others have answered, you do it the same way as making any other hotkey,
click for a while, drag and drop.  It allows you to cast a spell with one
keypress, or use an item's effect with one key press, that is why you would
do it.  Personally, for spells, I can cast just as fast with ALT-#, so I
don't bother with putting spells there, unless I also want to add something
else to the spell cast, like targetting, or a message, or an assist.  I did
do that with my boots that cast sow some time back, until I upgraded the
boots.
