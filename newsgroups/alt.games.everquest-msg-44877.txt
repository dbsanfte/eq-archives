AGI was 75, which means no penalties to learning Defense, but
no bonuses either.  Make nice with a Shaman/Druid/Ranger,
and ask for kitty feets or better.

I'm in the same trouble with my second rogue.  My first leveled
up to 50 before Kunark came out, and before Evade was in
the game.  Now, my level 40 rogue is sitting around with a level 34's
Defense skill...why?  Good groups and practice at higher levels
with Evade.

I _NEVER_ get hit when we fight, because the warrior and
SK/Ranger duo I usually play with have decent weapons, and
usually one Evade is enough to stay off the hate list or at least
lower than the healer.  I get hit so rarely, I've taken to going to
fight blues near zone lines just so I can get hit.  I _have_ to get
hit to raise the skill, but Evade is such an integral part of the new
roguish-skill base, it really makes raising Defense a pain.

Not that I'm complaining...it's better than getting a rez in LGuk
every time the Frenzied spawned...
:-)
