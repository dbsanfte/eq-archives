The answer to this is plain and simple, if you do not wish to donate,,,
don't get the buff.
If a chanter is casting and wants a donation, it is up to you if you want to
give it or not, no one in the game is forcing you to do something you don't
want to do.
On the other hand, I am more then happy to give 50pp each and every time
that I want c3.  I feel that whatever makes my mana bar move faster is
totally worth my pp.  No I will not donate if I am just sitting somewhere
and they offer it to me, and I sit and do nothing a lot, so I will just
waste that one away anyway ;-)

 "(its only mana...I dont ask money for sow lol)."
It's not "only" mana.. it is someone sitting back there medding, casting..
which takes time.  so the time that they take to do this is really what is
worth the pp.  I want to donate so they will be happy and continue to do it.
and as far as a druid is concerned, if you are sitting in the nexus ..you
don't ask for donations for ports if you don't want to.. but do you want to
port groups of people for free all the time? think of it that way=)   it is
your time you are taking.. and if im taking time to do something .. i want
some kind of donation=)

just my opinions=)

700 mana is relevant to a kei'd chanter (or c5'd wotver), I dont think so.

Damn that invite button click is worth...50pp for sure :P

You didn't have

My swords cost me money...my spells cost me money, my mana dont cost me
nothing....so are you saying that the other players should have to pay for
the enchanters spells? Damn, I spent all that play on my wizzies
spells...why dont people give him money (I will port for free when I can
port, I aint gonna sit around charging people for it).


SoW doesn't last a minimum of 2.5 hours...  SoW doesn't
> require a L60+ caster...

Wow you sure know how to stretch a single sentance....you still didnt make a
point though....

The other argument, it may cost you 100pp for kei but in 3 hours you can
make 300pp, thats still not relevant that 700mana to a level 60 and worth
100pp, sure the spell costs alot, lots of classes spells do...

Bleh....cant be arsed with kei argument, just hope nerf stick hits it (im a
newbie on a newish server and even I can see that kei is in no way good for
the game, especially for lower levels)
