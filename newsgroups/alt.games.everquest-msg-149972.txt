Scenario:  Setting up to spawn Faydedar for a Druid epic.
Usual strategy, put everyone back in the tunnel out of
the line of AoE fire except for the main tank (me,
level 60 Paladin), who is standing where Faydedar pops.


How it's supposed to go:

1.  After making absolutely certain that everyone is
ready and at their keyboards, Druid turns in the trigger
item.

2.  I beat on Faydedar for a few rounds to get good 
aggro, using Lay Hands for the first heal to keep 
the Cleric(s) from getting early aggro.

3.  I call in the rest of the tanks.

4.  When Faydedar is beaten down a lot, I call in the
casters to nuke him to death.


How not to do it:

1.  Druid mutters, "turning in trigger now" in the middle
of a bunch of folks cross-talking about final buffs
and preparations.  (I never even saw the announcement,
since I was doing my own last-minute spell mems and buff
checks.)

2.  Faydedar pops in front of me unexpectedly.  Hello...
Gee, I wish I had had time to mem Celestial Cleansing...

3.  I hit Faydedar exactly twice before he runs at
warp speed right into the middle of everyone else
in the tunnel.  Seems the Enchanter hadn't memmed Haste
yet and had just sat down to mem it.  Faydedar HATES
people sitting...

4.  Faydedar fires a few AoE blasts and knocks all the
casters down to half health (or less) right off the
bat.

5.  Okay, maybe this can still be salvaged if I
chain-stun Faydedar (stuns are *great* taunts) and
get him to run back to me at the shoreline.  Okay,
why's he not coming after me?  Okay, why's the Rogue
standing in the middle of the casters, stabbing the
crap out of Faydedar?  Okay, what part of my
pre-attack instruction (in original caps), "IF YOU
GET AGGRO, STAND STILL AND DO NOTHING" did he not
understand?

6.  Furthermore, what part of my spamming,
"<ROGUENAME>, PULL FAYDEDAR TO THE SHORELINE!!"
is he not understanding?

7.  Watch casters whither and die under repeated
AoE blasts.

8.  Figure "what the hell" and dive in to smack
Faydedar around while he eats the remaining casters.

9.  Get Faydedar down to 71% (not bad, considering...)
before I go down (last Dwarf standing, IIRC).

10.  Listen on the raid channel to several casters
announce that they death-looped about 8 times before
they /q'ed.

11.  Believe people when they say that the triggered
Faydedar despawns in 20 minutes.

12.  Wait for Faydedar to despawn so we can CR and
try again.

13.  2.5 hours later, try several times to pull the
non-despawned Faydedar out to kite him around 
while we CR.

14.  Find out that he refuses to leave the inner
island.

15.  Do kamikaze corpse-draggings with dragon
beating on me each time I go in.

16.  Kiss a yellow bubble of exp goodbye ("That
corpse is too old to be resurrected".)

17.  On run for sixth corpse, find out that Faydedar
doesn't *always* refuse to leave the central island.

18.  Die.

19.  Ride the boat (naked) back into TD and run
back to the island.

20.  Get there just in time for Faydedar to
decide he has had enough fun and despawn (5 hours
after the failed raid).

21.  Call it a night.
