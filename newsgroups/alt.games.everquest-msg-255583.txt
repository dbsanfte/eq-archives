*HISSS* Be gone, foul game!!! L2 is HORRID. I mean, I've never been
one to bitch about level grinds...but L2 has a level grind that'll
have you pulling your hair out by level 15. PvP griefers abound. NO
customization. Boring gameplay.

As for people getting bored with CoH, well...it's because the game
isn't for them. I've been playing since the end of beta and still
enjoy it. If you're a powergamer, you won't like CoH. If you're a
casual gamer and don't care about collecting loot and being 00b3r,
then you could well like it. Just...most of the people leaving are
leaving because they expect a powergamer's game and CoH simply isn't
that.
