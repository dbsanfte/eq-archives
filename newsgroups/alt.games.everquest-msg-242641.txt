The bazaar is not the be all and end all of answers you know. Nice for
twinks etc not great for new players (and this guy does not have SoL so is a
mute point I guess :) ).

Research is a skill worth having, sure it is a pain, it is a tradeskill what
do you expect?

Check it is not a vendor spell first, sure, but dont write off doing
research because it is 'a pita'.  If playing a game is a pita, dont fuckin
play it :P
