I don't intend to flame you, I just wonder why you feel the need to
insult the majority of the EQ population.  I tried PvP on Rallos, and
I didn't like it.  I tried PvP on Tallon, and again, I didn't like it,
though it was better than on Rallos.  I decided to not even bother to
try SZ, you only have to hit me with the bat a coupla times before I
realize it hurts  :)

You play your style, and have fun.  PvP isn't for everyone, in fact it
isn't for most people.  I, for one, am very glad Verant put in the PvP
switch and the PvP only servers.  Everyone gets to play the way they
want, so this name calling is kinda foolish.
