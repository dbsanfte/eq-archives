Nah, it's not that bad, I have an Athlon Thunderbird running at 1155 MHz and
a 32MB Geforce 2, hardly an amazing system, and I can run in 1600x1200 with
the clip plane all the way out and all the Luclin models on with a pretty
good framerate everywhere except zones totally covered in polygons
(Warslik's Woods, Shar Vahl, etc.).
