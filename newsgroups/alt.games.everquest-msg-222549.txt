Necros are probably the single most under-rated class in EQ. Primarily this
is because other players do not see damage done by necro DoTs - if they
could things would be quite different. In the past getting a group as a
necro could sometimes be a pain but with the advent of LDoN things have
changed quite significantly. These days, I turn on LFG and I usually have a
group in minutes and even get unsolicited tells asking me to join when I
dont have LFG on. Necro's are in there at the top of biggest damage dealers.

People who think necro's are just "twitch bitches", well they really don't
know the game too well and are probably best avoided. Twitching is a highly
inefficient use of mana a ratio < 1:3 (approx), but situationally it has
great uses e.g. your on raid that requires huge crowd control - twitch the
mezzers, intense battle with un-slowed mob and not enough cleric - twitch
the cleric. Raid or group wipe about to wipe - necro FD's and rezzes cleric
(no nightmare corpse runs) and  twitches cleric's to get things going again
quickly. I seldom get asked to twitch unless it is really necessary - a
necro's mana is best spend killing a mob fast. Twitching druids / wizards /
ranger - hmmmn don't even go there.

On big raids, the clearance stage, necro's probably dont do a great deal as
mobs going down too quickly to bother with DoTs - send pet, a nuke here or
there or a lifetap. On the big boss with 300k HP - this is where the necro
is in his element, pileing on DoT after DoT, feigning off the agro - dishing
out huge damage. With the mana-regen they can keep this up long after the
wizzard has gone OOM. For the most part pets are welcome on raids if you
have pet-discipline AA and your responsive enough to pull off pet if its
pushing mob somewhere undesirable.

Can't really comment on mage as I only have a level 5 - but from what I saw
I prefer the necro. Mage = no snare, no FD, no FD pulling, no fear, no heal,
no rez - ugh I imagine they die alot.
