Expectations!  THATS what I am wondering about.  The guild websites give their
charter , which is pretty common, no camp stealing, no kill stealing, etc...
but will they expect to receive your old items, will they expect you to drop
what your doing and run and port them?  Will there be hard feelings if you join
and then decide it's not for you and leave later?  
I've never found a guild with an "open" forum where you can just go read what
goes on "day to day".
