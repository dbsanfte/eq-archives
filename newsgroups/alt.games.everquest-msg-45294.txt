Obviously this is an incomplete list. 

If they really wanted to implement a roleplaying server then there are
a few changes needed.

1) Getting rid of common is good,  putting a level limit on learning
other languages is silly. Add NPC's language trainers in the outlands,
who for a fee will raise any language as long as you have skill points
to spend. This makes skill points more valuable and provides a money
sink.  Common will not exist. A Human language will be added and only
made easily available to certain races. 

2) Add banks to non player cities. Blackburrow, Crushbone, Splitpaw,
Guk, Cazic, should all have banks. 

3) Change bank storage. Money is global but items are not.  Thus you
could change cash, get cash or deposit cash at a large number of
places but if you stored items in the bank in Blackburrow, you would
only be able to retrieve them there too. Since all item storage is
local each local branch will charge a storage fee based on how much
stuff you want to store, a per day (in game) amount. The plus side is
your total available storage space theoretically has been multiplied
by a large amount. 

4) Quadruple the weight of all money and food and water. 

5) Every city has a bind area and an NPC who will bind you there for a
fee.

6) After one in game day of no food or water on your person your
characters run speed and carrying capacity begin to drop 10% per In
game day. 

7) Remove 80% of the food vendors.  There should be one or two NPC
food vendors  per zone.

8) All NPC vendors will be both faction and language restrictive. You
must obviously not be KOS to trade but you must also be able to speak
to the vendor. To talk to an NPC who speaks another language, you must
have devoted no less then one skill points per level into it.  This
means you could get to a maximum of 5 NPC native languages to fluency.

9) Every NPC will have a ALLIANCE  faction modifier. If killed or
helped there will be a small shift in ALL NPC members of that
Alliance.

10) Every NPC will have a RACIAL faction modifier. If killed or helped
there will be a small (Bigger then Alliance ) shift in ALL NPC members
of that race.

11) Every NPC will have a RELIGION faction modifier. If killed or
helped there will be a small (bigger then Racial) shift in ALL NPC
members of that religion. 

12) Every NPC will have a GUILD/CLASS faction modifier. If killed or
helped there will be a small (but bigger then Racial)  faction shift
in ALL NPC members of that Guild or Class. 

13) All faction shifts due to positive behavior will be at most 1/2
those due to negative behavior. 

14) Guards/Bankers/Merchants of any faction will have their faction
shifts Quadrupled. 

15) All NPC's will have factions. 

16) All NPC's will give Exp if they would normally. 

17) "Threatening" will now act as KOS. This level will be reversible,
due to quests and faction shifting. "Scowls" will also be KOS but when
a faction set gets to Scowls there will be NO WAY to improve faction
with that faction. 

18) Most NPC non mob factions will be center shifted by one layer,
Scowls to threaten etc.  to start with all new players. 

19) When grouping all other group members will have a "base faction"
associated with them to you based on your comparative races, classes
and religions. Each faction layer either positive or negative, will be
equated to a plus or minus 2% experience bonus or penalty. Thus groups
which have classes or races who are not friendly towards one another
will suffer an exp penalty for grouping together while friendly groups
will gain exp. 
This bonus or penalty will be capped at 20%.

20) Some items which have deity restrictions will be added. 

21) One char per server.

22)No TCC code anywhere.

23) Very few items will be No-Drop. Exceptions will include things
such as newbie notes and epic weapons. 

24) All NPC's will be assigned an level, based on what level character
they are equivalent too.

25) All Loot will be assigned an level, based on what level character
should use them.

26) All but perhaps 10% of non epic loot will be randomized based
totally on the character level of the mob and loot. A Mob of level X
will have a 50% chance of having loot of level X, a 20% chance each of
having loot of level X plus or minus 1. 8% chance of having loot that
is X plus or minus 2 to 5. And a 2% chance of having loot that is X
plus or Minus 6 to 10. 

27) Buffing another player will automatically generate the same
faction shifts for you that they receive during the entire duration of
the buff. 


28) This is a PvP server.  NO exp loss on PVP death. Items on your
body can be "insured" via an NPC for a per day fee and those items
insured will remain on your corpse unlootable. This fee will be drawn
directly from your bank.  Money (coins) will be lootable. Backpacks
will not be lootable. Factions will be affected by pvp deaths just as
if the player were a mob. 


29) Auction restricted to city zones: Qeynos, Surefall Glade,
Highkeep, Freeport, Rivervale, Erudin, Halas, Neriak, Grobb, Oggok,
Greater Faydark, Ak'Anon, Kaladim, Felwithe, Paineel, Cabilis, Kael
and Thurgadin. 


30) All spell level limits removed (ie clarity 2 cannot be cast on
someone less then 47).

31) Bind Affinity will be castable on any class anywhere. Any Bind
outside one of the old melee bind allowable points will however
require the use of a peridot as a reagent. This includes casters. 

32) emote will be language specific 

33) The /friend name command will require acceptance via a prompt from
the person.

34) The /who command will only display characters who are on your
friends list or who are neutral or better in base faction to you.

35) A /near command would be added that would be equal to a /who for
the current and all adjacent zones. 

36) Stamina loss Quadrupled while swimming.

37) All ocean zone lines crossable while not on the boat. 

and just for fun, 38) Sink Vellious into the ocean or fix the magic
resist/ magic immune mobs so casters can have fun too.
