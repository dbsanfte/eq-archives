Eh, how about:

a) Remove access to POK; make it so that the player has to explore the world
of Everquest. So, buddies can't join right away? Heck, start in the same
area!
b) Take away that bazaar abomination. Player merchants are fine, just you
want them distributed across the world; this creates local economies.

I was thinking that if you really insisted, to make POK a single common
point where you could only go back to where you came from, but it would just
move the bazaar instead of spreading the sellers around the world.
