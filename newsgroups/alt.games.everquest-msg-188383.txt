I haven't been around long enough to actually see kiting in action in 
the game, but going by the descriptions given in this group it sounds 
like it looks like running from a lot of big things if you don't know 
what's going on. If that's the case perhaps this guy was trying to do 
the noble, though somewhat less-than-bright, thing of buying you a 
little more time or trying to "save you" in some way. I know I've had to 
train myself to keep a laissez-faire attitude when people look like 
they're in trouble because most of the time they're just doing something 
else.

More likely than not though this guy was just doing his own thing and 
either not paying attention to what you were doing or not caring.
