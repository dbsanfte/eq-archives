5pp-What a bargain!  They sell for 20pp each on Drinal.  I sold 4 stacks one
evening for 10pp each because I priced them lower than anyone else.

Prices fluctuate a lot depending on how many of an item are available and
that all depends on how many people have figured out they can make money on
a particular item.  I made a lot of money when I levelled from 40-50 in
Tenebrous selling Essence of Wind for 100-150 pp each.  At that time there
were very few people selling these and they would fly out of my inventory
even at those prices.  Now there are a lot of people selling them and the
price has dropped to as low as 50pp ea.
