Howdy All,

Decided at long last to get my boxed cleric his clickie stick.   Had a
few friends helping me in skyfire looking for the pearls,  and in
about 3 hours we got 2 drops.  Then the friends had to run, and I went
on for another 2 hours solo killing (60 or 70ish random mobs).  No
drops.

Anyone find there is any pattern to this, or is it really a matter of
just keep going.
