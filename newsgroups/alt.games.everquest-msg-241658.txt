woohoo

GeForce FX 5900 Ultra, Windows XP Pro.  I have never had a problem going in
and out of windows mode, if I kept it in Windowed mode and left it there, it
seems like when the screen saver comes on.  Then gotta use the mentioned
Task Manager to get it all back.  It never went black when I went to window
mode to look at websites and such, only when left there for a few minutes.
Which corresponds to the screen saver kick-in time.  /shrug
