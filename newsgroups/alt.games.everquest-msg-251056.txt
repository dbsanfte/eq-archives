Supplying the Tradeskill consumables market is a good and steady way
to earn modest plat - spider silks, pelts for leather padding,
swirling shadows (shadeweavers thicket, used for smithing, can farm 1
stack an hour, fetch 35pp each - note the twilight sea shadows have
twice the droprate but eat low level melees!), HQ rockhopper hides to
make backpacks which you can turn into tokens and sell in bazaar.
