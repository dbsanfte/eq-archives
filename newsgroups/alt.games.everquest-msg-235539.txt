And how exactly did i prove that i wonder :) My high skill set would be very
usefull in many fields but regretably they can not afford to hire me .

Oh in case you are turgid or insensate and thought that maybe I disliked
jobs going over seas let me disabuse you of the notion.  I understand
exactly why they have done so and approve wholeheartedly. What i was doing
was tweaking the nose of those who do not understand or would like to
restrict the ability of employers to hire cheaper labor, and doing so in a
humorous manner.  The way I chose to do so pointed out that 5000 applicants
for a job we would consider very sub par means that each of those applicants
has a present circumstance which is worse than that sub par job. I would
never restrict those poor people from any chance at trying or a better life
even though the majority of americans would do so without a thought.

The interesting thing is that such obvious ironic satirical statement can be
so easily misunderstood by weak minds.
