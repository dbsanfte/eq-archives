Hmmm, define ignorant.  I'm sure in your parallel universe ignorant
means anyone who disagrees with you, but in the real world, I think
that one who willfully lacks knowledge or training will suffice.  Now,
since this person making the request for the CD did post a followup
explaining that he lost his CD, he had an account, and he would like
to install it on his new computer, I think we can assume for the sake
of arguement that he is aware of the restrictions imposed by not
having a valid account.  So it's public knowledge (i.e. posted in a
public forum) that he has an account, but lacks the installation
media.  He is requesting installation media, yet you ignore this fact
and proceed to be the prototypical ignorant asshole.

Self-rightous?  Are you fucking kidding?  I've dealt with a number of
usenet kooks in my time, and a lot of self-rightous idiots, but I have
rarely run across one with such a combination of pettiness and willful
ignorance as you.  There was a time when I thought you may have
something to contribute, but I haven't seen anything other than flames
and self-righteous posturing from you for months.  You might want to
have your doctor adjust your dosage, it appears that it's not working
as well as it should.

OK, let me explain, and I'll use small words so that you can
understand.  The original poster asked for the CD, then responded to
the first couple flame posts explaining that he had the account,
upgraded his computer, and needed to re-install it.  Either he's
lying, in which case I think he's been sufficiently warned that it
won't work, or he's telling the truth, in which case he has a
legitimate request.  Since I'm going to take him at his word and
assume that he has an account, he has no need  for a key.  I know that
you have comprehension problem, probably caused by cranial-rectumitis,
I will repeat that he states that he has an account, but no physical
installation media.

It's Jeremiah or Jer or Nipps or asshole or fucknose but never Jerry.
I haven't lived in Smallville for many years, and think I have a
pretty good idea how the world runs.  And I don't really like Nash
Ramblers, but if I wanted to buy one, I wouldn't buy one without
title, unless I was looking for a parts car to keep an existing Nash
Rambler going.  You claim to be a jeep fan, so you should be familiar
with parts cars.  Do you flame anyone who asks to buy a parts car
because they sometimes come without a title?  
Before you start on the legality of the distributing the software,
don't be a fucking hypocrite.  First, I know of exactly ZERO cases
where someone was prosecuted for distributing physical media when the
actual license is seperate, and almost all software companies realize
this.  That's why they have license keys.  Second, don't pull that
bullshit that all laws or regulations are equal and should be
followed, since you are by your own admission a marijuana user, and
therefore willfully violate criminal laws.  (Full discloser:  I am
also a marijuana user and willfully violate those and other laws.  I
just try not to be a hypocrite about it.)
