Personally, I love grouping with 60's.  They greatly increase the speed at
which we kill stuff.  Rogue's assassinating, Chanters with KEI, Shaman's
with Torpor, etc...

I'm 55 and flying through XP in ahkeva, great zone.  4 of us were there last
night (60 Rogue, 60 shaman, 58 bard, and me 55 cleric) and I was able to
actually work on my melee b/c I was full mana and everybody full health.
