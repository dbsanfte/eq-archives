Ok lets say you have 100k to twink any character, what class race
would you twink and what would you deck that bad boy/girl out with? Im
kinda bored and thought this might be a neat thread. I have a monk
that I twinked a bit back, and he has been alot of fun to play, Ive
been exploring all the old dungeons in the old world pretty much by
myself. So anyways, post up tell me what you might do and why?

Cheers
Halve
