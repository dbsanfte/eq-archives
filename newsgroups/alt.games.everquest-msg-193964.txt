Actually, after duoing with a necro quite often recently, I'm starting
to wonder how you buffers put up with it without snapping.  I have to
keep all my buffs on myself (of course), plus keep SLN and SoN on the
necro (extra hp), and Chloroplast and FoN on him as well (regen), plus
healing myself,  along with my melee duties.  I can't imagine keeping
up with that shit for a whole xp group *shudder*
