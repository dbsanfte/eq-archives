To dominate your opponent(s) using your, skill, map/resource knowledge,
enemy awareness (basically knowing where they are by sound) and, where
relevant, teamwork.

I agree with you suggestion of the goals but not crap that can go with it. I
can't remember the last time someone told me I was "0wned"
I'm sure it happens on public FFA servers and I hear that Count Strike is
rife with this sort of behaviour. Never played a clan game or a duel where
anyone ever said this.
