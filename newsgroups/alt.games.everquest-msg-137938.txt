Well, yes, the enchanter can adapt.  He was probably already casting mez 
on the mob going for the cleric before the tank even told the group he was 
switching (assuming he -told- the group, and didn't just assume that the 
chanter, who usually is watching the mobs more, would immediately notice 
him heading over there...) So when he runs over there and breaks the 
chanter's mez, he's wasted a minimum of 3.75 seconds of valuable crowd 
control time (recast time on Entrance) and 85 mana.  More, if he'd also 
tashed the mob the tank has now decided to kill first.  More, if 
he's getting resists from these mobs.  Generally, that's not all that big 
a deal.  On a 12-mob pull... it's easily the difference between life and 
death.  Now, if the tank wants to, as another poster suggested, run over 
there with attack off and just -taunt- the mob, sure, go for it.  It's at 
least a less bad idea... Personally, I'd rather the tank was doing damage 
and building up hate on the main mob like he's supposed to. :)

The tank should also be informed that there's an advantage in having a mob 
peel off the tank and head for the cleric.  Suddenly, there's a mob out of 
the pack that I'm almost certain the tank isn't on, so I can target it 
immediately and mez.

Or, maybe, if the chanter is already dead and DA/DB have been used... But 
that may well be the same thing.:)

The enchaner is entitled to whine in the name of constructive criticism.  
Now, that shouldn't be very -much- whining, and if it -is- a lot of 
whining, well, that's a separate problem entirely and you can wave bye bye 
to him now. :)
