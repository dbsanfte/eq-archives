It's also telling that of all the people I dealt with at work
yesterday, of all the people I talked to over the course of the day,
not a single person commented on how great it was that the television
stations dedicated a whole day of "don't forget to cry" down our
throats. In fact, the only people who bothered to mention it were
irritated by it and thought it was tasteless the degree they carried
it to. The fact that I had several people start a conversation with
"So, are you sick of the 'remember 9/11 stuff, too?" and not a SINGLE
person with "isn't it great how much the TV stations payed tribute to
9/11" kinda says something.

I work customer service. I deal with hundreds of people per day, most
of whom will strike up a brief casual conversation in the process. I'd
say I have a pretty good sampling of general opinion in my area at
least.
