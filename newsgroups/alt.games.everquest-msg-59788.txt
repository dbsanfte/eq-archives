Im a dork!  I asked the question under the fact that I had put 2 swatches
and 1 pattern in a large kit and it said it couldnt combine them, well after
reading your post I went back to try again and when I opened up my kit I
seen 2 patterns and 1 swatch there!  No wonder it didnt work!  Im such a
dork!  It must have happened because I had been tailoring for about 3 hours
and was tired I guess.  Anyways silly me wants to say thanks for your help.
Have a nice day.

Sheri  :)
