Thanks everyone for the great comments, advice and suggestions. I've tried
everything from a dagger to a club in the Secondary Weapon slot, but no go.
All I can use is a torch or shield, so I'll have to wait 'til I hit lvl 15
as you say. Torch at night and shield during the day. I've been using
tracking often, excellent skill that one, it's enabled me to find the odds
and ends required to fulfill my quest for Trueshot Armour. Also I've been
taunting everything I dare to so far and using the sense of direction which
has actually worked a cpl of times. Thank you Jennai for reminding me of the
foraging skill, imagine a ranger unable to even go berry-picking. When you
say "start saving now", I guess you mean that I should save some training
points to bump up my spell ability? I've kept 8 points in reserve "just in
case" 'cause I had a rough idea that skills come with experience, I just
thought that I had some skills that I really didn't. Better safe than sorry.
Thank you for reminding me of the kick and the hot keys as well. Now I can
use my bow. Fishing here in Faydark is pretty good although the locals do
throw the oddest things in the rivers. Does anyone have tips on swimming?
I'd really hate to drown, it's bad enough having walked out of a tree to my
death. With the help of everyone's kindly advice I'm sure to be a better
Ranger of Faydarks Champions. Good hunting and death to all evil.
