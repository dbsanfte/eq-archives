Uh, no that is not correct.

The point of the maps was for you to make them yourself, not for Sony to
provide them for you.

Sony has provided complete maps for some places, i.e., the Plane of
Knowledge.
Some maps will be incomplete--you are supposed to complete them. Some won't
even
be started--you will have to create the complete map. (Now you know what all
those cartography
tools are for.)

By the way, you can download the completed maps from some sites on the web
(for free). Then all you maps
will be complete.
