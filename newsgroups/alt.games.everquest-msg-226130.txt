Well, first suggestion would be to get a high-speed connection that
doesn't limit your connect time. If that's not possible, you'd
probably have better luck waiting for SOE to reply. How long ago did
you email them? It can take up to a week to reply sometimes, possibly
more in some cases depending on email volume at the particular
department.
