The first thing you should do after creating you character is remap the
autoattack key to something that you won't accidently hit when talking to
someone (i use kp_ins,  close to the move keys for a quick tap when
neccessary).

Some other things i have found to be useful are to set up hot keys for /loc,
/corpse, /con and /yell.
