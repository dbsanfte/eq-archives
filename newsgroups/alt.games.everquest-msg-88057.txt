This is true for just about anything dealing with "Soft" Modems.  They are
trash imo.  When using a "Soft" Modem (better known as WinModem, note the
Win, as in Windows, this should tell you something from the get go) you are
relying upon the OS and/or some other means of software to replace hardware.
Software is cheap and easy to copy from one computer to another via cloning
(ie. mass production lines at Dell, Gateway, etc.) as opposed to actually
have to PAY for more physical components on a non-"Soft" Modem.

Has anyone ever used DoubleSpace?  Here you are substituting physical drive
space with compressed data (more less software).

Any software RAM "boosters?"  Same thing.  Substituting physical RAM by
creating "Soft"ware RAM.  Granted, I've seen many of these used
successfully, but, I certainly wouldn't imagine installating this on a
system handling sensative data.

I personally will make effort to stay away from substituting ANY hardware
with software.  Linux/Unix can make a great gateway/router, though I'd
rather stick with my Cisco and use the Linux for what it was intended.  (to
hax0r yer a<<0un75) <grin>
