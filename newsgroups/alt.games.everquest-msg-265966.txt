Good reason. If you'd said that in your original message you probably would 
have avoided leaving the impression that the net difference in price was 
bothering you. I'd be hesitant to spend a monthly fee on two MMOGs myself, 
but to be able to move from whatever generation mmog DAoC is, to a next 
generation like WoW or EQ2 I wouldn't mind paying an incremental difference 
of a couple of bucks a month. Of course there are other factors tho, like 
where your friends all play, the investment you've already made, etc. Nice 
that we have all these choices now, eh?
