Actually, I'm thinking they recently upped the taunt value of high melee
damage, relative to hit frequency... around the time of the 2 handed weapon
bonus revamp.(or perhaps it was always there, the extra damage just made it
more noticable)

My friend was recently lucky enough to get a *very* nice 2 hander....  53
damage, 45 delay.  (no, those aren't reversed, the damage is higher than the
delay).  Even though he is only double attacking at 45 delay, while the main
tanks are dual wielding and double attacking with 20 delay weapons (I
assume)....  he is doing enough damage that he sometimes has a problem with
being summoned and killed in large fights.  Even with not even looking at the
taunt button.
