Damn Wizard you must have forgotten to include all your spelling and grammar
errors in your post. If there was ever any doubt the spelling and grammar
errors were all a sham  there isn't any doubt now.

Well I have an idea too!  If most of them want "peace" as you say, 
Why don't these passive Pali's try to "convince" the terrorists
that as long as they keep bombing Israel, the more Israel will
take control of the land, and that affects ALL Palistinians!
So you see, the REAL enemy of the Palistenians are THEMSELVES!

If you live there, you should know this.  Instead, you act like
you TOO have been brainwashed.  Next thing you're gonna tell us
is that Arofat is doing a good job, and really making advances
in the plight of the Palestinians, right ?

Get the GOOD Pali's to stop the BAD Pali's, THEN you will have 
a solution! There is no more effecive stragity than "brother"
against "brother".  (as opposed to "stranger" against "brother").
