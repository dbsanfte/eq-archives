That's correct.

Well, in most cases. Yes, I tend to be a person that will pay more up
front for a good quality product. (Or what I *percieve* to be a good
quality product. IBM makes a hell of a business machine, but it's not a
"gaming machine". I know that now, but did not when I bought it. The
flip side to this coin is that I have contacts at IBM who allowed me to
make use of the family store, personal discount, etc. and got my box for
a little more than half of what Gateway wanted for the same box without
a Pentium, and the same stats everywhere else except the video card.)
However, they do tend to be expensive beasts to keep or get hold of.

If you can get straight RDRAM, that may well be true. In the case of my
machine, however, your 60 dollar figure is woefully wrong. We've all
seen what can be had for 133 SDRAM 256 sticks on the web, yes? How much
will you pay each for them?

Well, this machine takes essentially proprietary 800 MHz, RIMM, RDRAM
that has to be installed in pairs (allegedly, though I think it's
bullshit.) I found it from two sources, one being IBM, for basically the
same price. 209 Bucks per stick. Yep.... 418 dollars for two of the 256
sticks. THat's a big difference.

Knowing what I've learned from this upgrade experience, I certainly
won't be again. Unless, of course, it's for business use only, DB work,
etc. For that, it's a powerful tool.
