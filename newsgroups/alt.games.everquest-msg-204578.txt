If you want other people to play with, try Paladul.  If, on the other hand,
you want the best exp in the game, you should go to Paladul.  If you want
money...well you should level up in Paladul and then get money with your
newly 25 character, rather than bothering trying to get cash at 11 to 25.
What's another couple days of poverty, over before you know it.

Barring this, your option is to put the LFG flag on, remembering that its
now broken so you need to put it on again every time you zone, and hope
someone is clever enough to who all 10 15 lfg or something.

And then try doing a who all 11 and see where everyone is at your level.
