Orcs and more orcs.  Simple, relatively fast (faster than any
do-it-a-thousand-times quest), and won't hurt your Freeport Militia
faction.

Big, yes.  Not also "bigly" detrimental to your FPM faction, no.

Altunic Jartin has already been mentioned, but his being a merchant
makes him not quite as useful as he could be.  Another possibility is
Simon Aldicott, who almost always stands on the NW shore of the
lake in West Commonlands.  I'm almost certain he's on the Knights
of Truth faction, especially since he's part of a Freeport-based Paladin
quest concerning a funeral for a long-lost Paladin (the Divine Might
quest).  You can see him from a long distance away and con him
"remotely".

It comes out in the NW corner, by the "Office of the People", which
isn't by the bank.

If you're okay to the barbarian epic quest NPC who stands near the
zone (you may be), then it should be safe for you to peek out
of the tunnels and wait for one of the wandering North Freeport
guards to cross the bridge and check your faction with him.

If you have questionable faction with the Knights of Truth, you'll
have a problem with all North Freeport guards, and it doesn't matter
*how* you try to get the bank, you'll get jumped.  If nothing else,
there's a guard *in* the bank.


>5. What other factions in N. FP do I need to worry about in trying to

>to avoid?

No wandering NPC's that I know of.  Just stay out of the Cleric and
Bard's guild.

>work to be done there?

Bankers who are scowling at you will still do business with you.
It's the NPCs around them you have to worry about.
