There is one song "desperate dirge" that uses mana it is around 300damage,
area effect song that you get sometime after 30, I think there might also be
a
new velious song that also takes mana, but that is it.

Chords of Dissonance really dosnt do that much damage, but it has a fairly
high
taunt factor, I try to avoid using it anywhere near high level npcs like
guards,
and also around groups fighting just so you dont pull stuff onto you.
