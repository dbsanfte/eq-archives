I wouldn't go to Kaesora with a group any lower than 45.  Most of the
critters cast and you can get into lots of trouble if you don't know your
way around(there are quite a few pits and holes to fall into).  Furthermore
the place is pretty buggy.  We went there with a group at 35 and spent about
a day getting all of our corpses back.  Things would come through walls and
interesting things like that and although our friendly neighborhood GM told
us that the zone was very very buggy and they were aware of it, he said that
he couldn't help us at all.
