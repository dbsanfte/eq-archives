Funny...  The fact that there are currently maps on www.eqatlas.com with a
beastiality list there, which, for the most part, DOES LIST FACTION, and
this is the part that ISN'T a premium service on Alakazam...  It would be
sufficient to say that it is possible to research things prior to going
there or prior to killing something to know what might be involved and what
you have to consider when doing something.

2 week delay in poking unknown mobs with no clue about the faction issue
versus no delay, still poking an unknown mob, taking the faction hit you
don't want and knowing it after the fact...  Hmmm.  In the reference to Tim
Smith's mentioning of it... 1 death, not knowing...  Still have the hit.
Yes, you will have to work up your faction to get it back, but then, you
can also look it up afterwards or talk about it in game, then go off, look
it up then say yes or no like any normal player.
