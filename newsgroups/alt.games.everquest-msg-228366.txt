Just wanted to add my voice to the chorus.  After picking my jaw up off
the floor that a guildie would have the audacity to boast about something
like this, I would boot them out fast.

Well, actually, my guild policy does allow for members who do something
like this to "make amends". I would require this guild member to pay back
the 25k, plus an additional 20k so I could be sure they meant it, and to
apologize to this person in my presence. If they did not, /guildremove.

Gotta give folks a chance to atone, I suppose, but I'd make sure that that
atonement required them to really bust their ass, or it wouldn't prove
anything.
