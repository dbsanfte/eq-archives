You have several options.

1.  Hop the big boat from FV take it to the second stop, hop on the shuttle,
take it to BBM, go over to the north dock, hop the boat to Freeport, walk to
whciever commons you want to get to.

2.  Hop the big boat from FV, swim to Ogre Island (Get a map for the loc, by
memory, around 7000,n3000), take the raft from Ogre Island to Oasis, run to
whichever commons you want to get to.

3.  Hop the big boat from FV, or the boat from OT, swim to around
n12000,4200, dive down to the bottom under the wizzie spires, swim down the
passage, walk over to the appropriate pot (south side of room, don't
remember which one specifically, might be right one), double click on it,
you will be teleported to the docks in Freeport, walk to the commons you
want to get to.

4.  Run over to OT, swim out to the boat (If good character), approaching it
from the side away from the docks, climb aboard, take the boat to Ogre
Island, run over to the raft, take it to Oasis, run to the commons of your
choice.

5.  Get a teleport to WC.

That covers most of the options.  There are other variations on them that
you could try as well.  There are also teleport options available to any
player, but either expensive, or require fairly high level to get.
