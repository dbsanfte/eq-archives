How many of them were A) outside of Rathe Mtns., and B) weren't over some
rare quest mob/toy dropper, and C) weren't a two-fer, one from each party
involved?

I've been KS'ed.  It is *rare*.

I've been accused of KSing when I definitely hadn't many more times.  I've
seen many people accuse other people of KSing that definitely weren't. 
Losing a race sucks, but it doesn't mean you got KS'ed, it means you lost
the race.  Some people are sore losers.

I'd guess that a full 90% or more of the "KS" petitions didn't involve any
actual KS.
