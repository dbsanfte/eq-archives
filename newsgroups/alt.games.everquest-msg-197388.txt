There are certainly many things I'd like to do, or buy, that I cannot afford
to now, but they are almost all extensions of what I already do.  E.g., I'd
like a big house.  I'd then like to get a piano and take lessons.  I'd like
to resume guitar lessons.  I'd like to put out a $200 million contract for a
hit on the idiots at Fox who cancelled "Futurama" and "Firefly".

But for the most part, give me time with my best friend, a couple good
bookstores, a good internet connection, a few fast computers, and a
reasonable home entertainment system, and I'm happy.
