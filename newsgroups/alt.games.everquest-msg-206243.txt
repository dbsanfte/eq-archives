Really?  You have two events on the client: (1) player stops moving, and (2)
player starts casting spell.  How does the speed of light prevent the server
from telling what order these occured in?

You have either made a mistake and confused this with a lag problem, or you
are reminding us that in different inertial frames, the ordering of events
can be different, according to special relativity, and this is derived from
the speed of light being a finite constant in all frames.  I have no idea
which.
