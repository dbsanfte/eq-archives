*She* (if I'm recalling the message correctly, and really, I don't
feel like digging through my e-mail for it :)) is still around.  After
digging through google to get the cached version of the page after it
disappeared, I sent an e-mail asking about it.  And now I've forgotten
what she said, so hold on while I dig through my e-mail ;p

Yup, she's a she.  Quote from the e-mail:

"The server took off my web page, and I'm trying to work with someone
else into putting my guide on a new address. ... Thats pretty much all
the info I can give you now, sorry...  I've been slaking off factions
for a while in favor of a little leveling ;)"
