Just stock up on the words. You can research cornucopia and everfount until
they are trivial, as that will help improve your skills as well.  The lvl 20
spells are components of the 24 pet spells, you can find all of the lvl 20
spells on the Ancient Cyclops island in the ocean of tears (get off on
sister isle and hang a left off of the dock).  If you can get cornucopia to
"trivia" (which is relatively inexpensive anyhow), the lvl 24 pet spells
will be trivial also I beleive.
