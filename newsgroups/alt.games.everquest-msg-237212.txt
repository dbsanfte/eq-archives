Unless you play multiple classes, which many of us do, and can see
first hand that some have a decidedly rougher time of it.  The key to
balance, in my opinoin is grouping / soloing / raiding dynamics.

For the most part people are really only concerned about ease of
grouping. The single most important measurable balance indicator is
the desirability of a class in groups. To some extent they are willing
to tolerate less group desireability in exchange for better solo
potential and to a much lesser degree for better raid desireability.

That's about it. The thing that gets in everyones face is when a class
is both comparatively easy to solo and highly desirable in groups.
Everything else is just background noise.

If your desireable in groups then its clear you bring 'enough' dps or
other utility to the group that your presence is desired equally to
other classes.

Grouping desireability/dynamics alone is key to perceived game
balance. It doesn't matter if the classes are 'mathematically
balanced' or balanced in some intangible other way (like ease of
earning cash, or ease and speed of recovering corpses, or ability to
teleport around...) If these other intangibles don't make the player
group desireable then he remains out of balance.

Certainly there is isolated whining about competition for equipment
with some classes, or difficulty to obtain a specific spell or item.
Or a specific zone or tactic  where a class is at a comparative
disadvantage to the particular resist/regen/summon/casting/etc
characteristics of the mobs in that zone but these are all local
issues.

Some are just noise and some are legitimate gripes but those aren't
significant class balance issues, just minor tweaks that would be
worth doing. (Like when epic mobs for one class spawn only once in 2
weeks...and members of the class are backed up for a year in
scheduling raids while another's spawn daily... this is a probably a
legitimate gripe... epics should be all roughly equally valuable and
equally difficult to obtain... and the fact that they aren't is fair
to complain about... but not really problem with the class balance...
especially this long after epics were released.)

The other major source of griping is class overlap... but that's
already reflected in group desireability... Monks aren't upset that
Berzerkers are doing significant damage per se... they're upset
because that threatens their place in the group, particularly if along
with comparable damage they bring significant other utility.

And now with the new combat system incoming looks like he's
effectively getting them....
