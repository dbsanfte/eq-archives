It's too bad that there aren't 2 types of aggro in game - live aggro versus
undead aggro.  Then a Warrior's Taunt could be coded as 75% live / 25%
undead, while a Paladin's could be coded 25% live / 75% undead.

After all, as per the rest of the Paladin description, a Paladin's "enemy"
is primarily the undead.
