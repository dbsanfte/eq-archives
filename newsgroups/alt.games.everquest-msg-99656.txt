In ZoneAlarm, access Program Control, select eq_game.exe, click on Options,
go to the Security tab and select "Authenticate Program By Full Path Name
Only".  Repeat for teh other EverQuest programs (Everquest.exe, etc.).
ZoneAlarm will then stop checking to see if the EverQuest
progarms/components have changed and will simply verify that you have
allowed them to communicate.  Of course theoreticly a hacker could spoof the
eq program names and components on your PC , and ZoneAlarm would allow them
to communicate . . ., but what are the odds?
