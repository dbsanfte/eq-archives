No, you suggested that it would have been "better" if he had targetted
militants instead of civilians. Better for *us*, maybe. But pretty
pointless for *him*.

Show where I said *I* supported what Bin Laden does, or admit you are
trying to tie me to it because you disagree with what I said.

Actually its your butting into other people's business that is getting
innocent people killed.

I don't see you volunteering. Another chickenhawk?
