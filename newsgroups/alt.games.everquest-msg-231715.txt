You assume too much DT...

It was released with a major flaw for multiplayer gaming by keeping
the character information all client side. That as far as Im concerned
made it substandard on its own. It screwed over playing through the
internet client by making it too vulnerable to hackers.

Single player was fun to play but a bit repetitive, that was common for
the day though an the story and advancement more than made up for that
issue. As was multiplay on a closed LAN. In the UK though such things were
fairly rare to access and so a phone line play was the best way to go. It
wasn't the only internet play game with this. THe problem being you didnt
find out till you'd coughed up for the game and so people a) tended t
persist with it and b) stuck the limited side they could access.
