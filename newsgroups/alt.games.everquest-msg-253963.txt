Well I was thinking in general terms. I've only played a rogue up to
about 20, about 2 years ago, so I can't comment on the high end. My
reference was simply, unlike other classes besides the rogue, the
berzerker can reduce agro on himself without FD. Which like I said,
should have the net effect of better effective DPS, without getting
agro. Other than that it is nothing like a rogues abilities.

If the Pally leads with a stun, or the SK leads with his snare, my
Shaman can Slow almost immidietly on the mob getting in range. After
that I have to wait a little while before I can cripple or DoT or I
will get agro. If the Pally lands a few stuns early, I can cast just
about anything I want and possibly even sit down (at a safe range)
without getting agro. Pallys are agro machines on any server.

This relates more to the skill of the player than anything else. I
have grouped with many tanks that couldn't hold agro even if you gave
them a bucket to hold it in. SK's and Pallys that refuse to snare or
stun, either because they don't have KEI and it would cause down time,
because the snare has a long cast time and would "slow down pulls", or
in a few cases (God help us), because it would give them so much agro
that the other melees in the group couldn't pull the mob off of them.
Apparently they had some unhappy experences with clerics in the past.
/sigh

As for warriors, I don't know. I'm playing one now, and can seem to
hold agro pretty well, (Managed to keep it off a rogue 8 levels higher
than I, most of the time, and got it back a second or two after the
backstab) but haven't grouped with many as my Shaman to make any
comparisons.
