They don't by default (Tho i can fear with ID, blind with my bio orb, root
with my goos, snare with my sap/fungus thing)

Btw, blind does NOTHING if your in melee range of a mob.  So it wouldn't
make the slightest difference to blind a mob hitting on a low-hp person (or
hitting on any person, for that)

Anyway the word taunt was used.. I took that as refering to the taunt skill,
and answered accordingly.

Sure there are plenty of methods of preventing that death.. root is
proximity agro, a snare wouldn't get low-hp agro either.. maybe if you cast
it over and over and over, I kinda doubt it though.

You also forgot the good old "heal them" method to save somebodies bacon.
For the added bonus, it even works as your taunt.
