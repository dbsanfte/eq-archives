She got the first Skyfire Ragefire. Members of another guild came in
after him while she was already gathering forces, and although they
ended up helping her kill it instead of causing trouble, some of their
members now act like she owes them the world for 'them getting her her
epic' instead of trying to KS her *sigh*.
I saw bits of those cleric threads and there's quite a bit of hard
feelings, but I hope it works out. It seems a lot of the people who
felt miffed are forgetting Ragefire won't spawn any faster or
necessarily fall into their lap sooner if he's pure FFA.

Speaking of dragons and rezzes... we decided to try our teeth on one
of the WToV dragons, Telkorenar, last night. As we walked up to him to
take screenshots before the fight, for the first time ever I hit \ (my
remapped atk key) instead of F10 when I went to clear the windows off
my screen - *splat*. Luckily, he was content with just AEing everyone
else nearby and didn't go after them, and I actually dodged the first
hit in the two rounds he used to kill me. Go me.

(No, we didn't kill him, we called the fight when he was at 60% and
learned a lot from the failure.)
