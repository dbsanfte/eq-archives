 Exactly. People in the US are absolutely OBSESSED with COLOR and 
COLOR only and feel the need to constantly classify the Humans that 
live here by color. We are constantly asked to state our "race" on
employment forms, censuses, and college admissions applications to 
name just a few. This obsession with classification according to skin
color only encourages and facilitate -illegal- discrimination. Consider
Rwanda in the 1990s with the Tutsis and Hutus. People of the Tutsi 
tribe were easily recognizable by their physical appearance and were
required to carry ID. There ID numbers all carried the letter "T" at 
the end of there ID numbers, Hutus did not. If you are not aware of 
what happened in Rwanda all I will say is that those people with a "T"
in their IDs were systematically slaughtered by the Hutu tribe who held
control of the government at that time.
 
 My point is that when you classify Humans by whatever measure however
esoteric, you open the door for abuse. This has happened repeatedly 
throughout history. We are all Humans. The is only one race on this 
planet that walks upright and uses language to communicate. Humans.
Humans come in all shapes, sizes, colors and appearances, but we are 
ALL humans.
 
 Every single time I am asked to fill out a form that asks my "race" I
fill in the section marked Other____________. I write in Human. I have
done this dozens of times, most recently with the 2000 U.S. Census.
Never ONCE, NEVER ONCE have I been challenged or asked to make another
selection. I will continue to do this to the day I die.

  I would also like to mention to those who maintain that "whites" or
"caucasians" are the "majority", I got bad news for you. This -MAY- be
the case in the U.S. and a few small countries in the northern Hemisphere
but in reality, world-wide people of color vastly outnumber people
of no-color, or "caucasians".
 
 And for those people of color in the U.S. I got something else to
say. I constantly hear you screaming about "discrimination" when
something you don't like happens to you. "Discrimination is simply
the act of making a choice. We do it hundreds of times a day. What
you really mean to scream about is -illegal- discrimination. That 
is when you are affected adversely by a choice somebody has made.
If a job requires you to have a certain degree or skill that you do
not possess and another person is chosen, that certainly was 
discrimination, yes, but it was not -illegal- according to U.S. law.
I am so sick and tired of people screaming and bitching about being
"discriminated against" or having their "constitutional rights"
violated, when in fact there was NOTHING wrong being done. Get over 
it. Bad stuff happens to everyone regardless of the color of their
skin.
