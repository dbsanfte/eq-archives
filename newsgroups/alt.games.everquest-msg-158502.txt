So what do you do when you're in a group, then?  I grouped from 20-30
in HHK and I didn't want to poison right away, so I'd weaken the mob
(having already given strength to whoever was tanking) and dot it once
or twice, then when it was getting about half health I'd smack it with
poison and all of a sudden I'd have a *very* angry goblin smacking me.
They didn't often last long enough for me to feel dots did much good -
I'd cast one and by the time the second went off, the goblin would
basically be dead.  Lifetaps were okay but shock of poison did way
more damage than the two lifetap spells I used while there, and for
about the same amount of mana.  Of course, the 'way more damage' was
probably the problem :) but I felt fairly useless in groups sometimes
when they were going down so fast that I hardly had time to cast one
spell...

Okay, yes, that would be a very bad problem :) Too bad, I thought
perhaps you meant it turned them into skellies of the appropriate type
- like dragons turning into dragon skeletons (now THAT would be fun),
and so on.
