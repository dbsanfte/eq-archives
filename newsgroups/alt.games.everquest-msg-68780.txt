Please, I'm curious now...where have I ever denied that there were
bugs in the client software, hmm?

Excuse me, the problems to the degree of the game being totally and
completely inaccessable are USUALLY compatibility issues. Better?
Yeah, there were big bugs, most of which have been squished. But very
few of those bugs made the game completely unplayable. Non caused LDs
that weren't through the game crashing. If your lag bar ticked down,
it wasn't the software itself that was the problem.

In the end, the majority of players could log in and play. Yes, with
problems, but few people were so bad off the game was unplayable.
