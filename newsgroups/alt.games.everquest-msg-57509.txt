If there are three groups from a couple of, say, French guilds
raiding, and their pullers are using /shout or /ooc to announce
incomming pulls to the rest of the raid, then they should be free to
use whatever language they way.  If it annoys people who don't speak
their language, that's too bad.  The communication was not meant for
them, so they should ignore it.

However, if someone is using /shout or /ooc to announce a train to the
zone, that should be in English, written concisely and clearly ("train
to WL zone", as opposed to something like "Heading into the sunset
with the biggest caboose you've ever seen, so get off the tracks!"),
because English is the most widely understood language.  (This is how
it works in RL.  For example, all international communication between
airplanes and air traffic control is in English.  Even if it is a
French pilot in Paris talking to a French controller, if it's an
international flight, they speak English).
