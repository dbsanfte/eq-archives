Not even close.   The cleric epic is easy by comparison.   The only thing that
is even remotely difficult about it is the competition for it.

Ixibilat fer is a joke.

The King in Chardok... the Queen would rip him a new one.

Ragefire?   Warriors get to kill Ragefire, then turn around and kill his
bastard cousin in EJ thats even worse.

And while the Ragefire camp may suck, at least it *can* be camped.   Try
camping a dragon that spawns in the middle of a wide open zone like EJ.   He
is as rare as Ragefire time wise, (or more) and every time it pops it's a race
to see which guild can get in position to pull him first.   There is no small
room for a warrior to sit in that allows him to claim it.    One warrior in
our guild played a druid in EJ for about 2 months before finally giving up.
(We did 3 raids over that time period, one was ganked and on the other two the
zone crashed when we went to pull it.  Usually because an uber goober guild
was gathering also and the two raids combined were way too much.  EJ crashes
at about 60 or 70 people.)

Odd, I seem to remember you posting not too long ago that it was almost
completely worthless, since it only saved you 'a bit of minor meditation
time.' ;)
