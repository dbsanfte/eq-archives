The summoned foci have basically the same range as other foci with levels
only ours are given fancy names.
Level 1 = up to and including lvl 24 spells
Level 2 = up to and including lvl 44 spells
Level 3 = up to and including lvl 60 spells
Level 4 = up to and including lvl 65 spells

Aparently the problem with the bracer is that it's given really late to be
of much use. Your best bet is to just ask a higher mage to make you one.
