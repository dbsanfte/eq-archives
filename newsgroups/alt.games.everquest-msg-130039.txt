> you'd risk your own life for a step closer to true freedom... 

"RISK"??   *RISK* ???  The term "RISK" implies that something is
VALUED!.  They don't VALUE their life, thats my point!  They
WANT to kill themselves - they are not "risking" their lives!!
You don't "risk" a McDonalds bag when you throw it in the trash!
When a Pali pops the popcorn botton on his parka and goes "pow",
there is no "risk" involved, he WILL go "pow" - what the hells
wrong with ya anyhow ?

A REAL soldier would "risk" his life, be smart enough to wage
war with a goal of staying alive (aka "risk") to come back and
fight another day.  A MARTER (aka Heavens Gate Whacko) sets out
to DONATE his life.  So make THAT a part of your "loss of life"
equation will ya???


> especially when your state has no comparable support.

That that up with the Arab "brethern", don't be blaming that on us.


> "give me freedom or give me death"

Thats fine. Totally out of context, but thats fine.  A wiser man 
would say somehing like: Give me freedom, or I'll fight my ass
off for it.  And know what?  many-a-man did just that too. 
(chant: You ess A, You ess A, You ess A)  

> think i got that quote right....

Quote-smote. You need to watch a little of Oliver North's "War Stories".


> a realist?  realists deal with the truth...

Does the all that B & W footage they play on Olli North's WWII
war stories deal with truth by any chance ?  (just curious)  :)

> and are truly unbiased.
> you have yet to list an unbiased, independant resource!

Koffi Annun. Oh, and speaking of that, where were you a few
weeks ago when I was on my high-horse about the Blue Line?
EQ: - help me out here.  EEng? ...

> "realist" work.

"Realist" work huh....  So just how much out of proportion missplaced
human empathy have I been spewing.


Here is whats real: ("realist" - aka ME)
War works, peace ALWAYS follows war, Only Victory is respected,
Waepons can forward your cause, You *can* outfox the enemy if
you are smarter, maintain a goal of staying alive to fight
one more day, take any land deal you can get, fight smart.

What is NOT real: ("non-realist" aka YOU)
*any* loss of life is bad, and MUST be avoided at all costs,
propoganda works, whining works, crying real loud that "I'm
the victim" works well, play on peoples heart-strings works,
un relenting human empathy works in gaining support, slinging
rocks (to sometimes have them come around and "bean" you in the
head) works, USA is BAD, the West has all the wealth, we have
none, so therefore they *must* be withholding it from us, 
disquise support of terrorism with loads of "human empathy"


> you're a child who refuses to take part in real research and analysis.

I just did! - look above.

> have fun with that "realist" label.. becuase that's all you have.. a label.

Cool.


> go back to your jungle you ape.

Eouhhhhhh, Niiiiice!


> misplaced empathy?  how can you justify the killing of 1000+ palestinians?!

You are consumed with what, 1000 Pali's with cheap blood, who don't
even want to live themselves ???  Surely you are kididng me here!
What about SIXTY thousand lost on the hills of the battle of Anzio ?
Another 60,000 in Japan, Stalingrad? ....Need I go on ?

Bullshit??  FoxNews video cameras LIEING to me ??  So are you calling
the photos of sucide bombers flesh hanging from phone poles bullshit ??

Well, if you call photo's of blown up Pali suciside bombers "bullshit",
I guess so.  Somehow I wasn't expecting you to be openminded - being
able to refrain from wanting to kill the messanger is not all of 
us can do, eh ?

Ahhh, I see, they can't.
