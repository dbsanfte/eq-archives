Both are poor analogies. Concert tickets are sold by the concert
promoter. It is illigal to scalp tickets though. The license to enter
the concert explicitly forbids it.

Lift tickets can be sold. You can't sell tickets you don't own, and
you can't transfer day or season lift tickets between people once you
use them.

One more thing, a warranty is often untransferrable, you sell your
car, you don't often transfer the lifetime warranty from Billy-Bobs
Bonanza of Brakes for the new owner. It is for the owner who brought
in that specific car.

For your specifics, Sony owns the system they sell time on. They sell
the account and make the rules.

Yantis is a parasite, he violates the EULA and sells what he doesn't
own. I have pointed out that he is in peril criminally and civilly. He
can be sued by Sony. I wonder why they have not done so. IANAL, but I
know that if you don't enforce a copyright/trademark provision, it
becomes precedent, and that makes later enforcement tougher.
