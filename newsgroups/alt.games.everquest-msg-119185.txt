Hello

The best way to spend your points at character creation may vary a lot with
time.

I remember when dumping all points in strength was the best way to go for a
melee.

I remember when dumping a lot of points in agility was the choice to make
for a melee.

I remember when dumping all your points in charisma was the way to go for an
enchanter.

etc..etc..etc...

Everyones got his own theory.

Dumping all your points in stamina is recommended cause it seems to be the
hardest stat to raise with the items which can be found at this time. Who
knows what items will be available when the next expansion is released ?

I know a lot of people who put their points quite randomly at character
creation (2 or 3 years ago) because they didnt know much about game
mechanics. And so what ? They are very good warriors or enchanters or ...

We are speaking about the 20 or 30 points you have to spend at your
character creation. Its not a lot. I think you have no reason to feel
frustrated.

Regards

PS : english is not my native language
