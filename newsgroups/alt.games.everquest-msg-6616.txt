I put a lot of points into my dwarf cleric's Strength.  He always wanted
to be a paladin, I explain, as I walk him up to mobs and pound
away instead of sitting and medding quietly as some party members
expect.

The fact that I'm outdamaging many of the tanks in my group makes
me smile.  Is this optimal?  Well, no, but its not useless either.  I"m
not a tank by any means, as I don't taunt and wouldn't want to... but
I can contribute significantly to damage output at no mana cost in terms
of either spells or medding.  It is unfortunate that my "FM to OOM"
range isn't as large as it could be, but having first played a High Elf
cleric up to high levels, I wanted to experiment with something different.

I also know from experience that in most cases I  won't ever get to FM,
and that I can maintain a comfortable 60M to 80M range for comfort
fairly easily.  I seek out wis gear of course, but its interesting to note

that there is a fair amount of +wis/+str gear out there... so far my wis
and str are maintaining a rough par with each other!

On the other hand, I can't think of any use your Ogre's INT is
going to be to you or parties you group with.  You can roleplay an
intelligent well lettered ogre without dumping points into that stat.
If you want to try out some hypothetically sub-optimal alternatives
to STR, consider DEX (increases proc rate on fancy weapons) or
STA (increases hit points) or AGI (increases the rate at which
your opponents miss you).  Alternately, play a Shadowknight, which
is an Ogre tank class which actually gets some use out of INT, and
-then- blow all your points on the INT stat.

For more "I'm highly educated" fun, work on languages for your
ogre.  Being able to speak in clear understandable polysyllabic
english isn't particularly indicative of your ability to roleplay, in
an ogre it looks like you are merely ignoring the racial roleplay
elements in your speech.  On the other hand, conversing with
High Elves in Elder Koada' Dal, or Erudites in Old Erudite, -that-
would  demonstrate an intellectual bent.  You will find, of course,
that you have to "dumb things down" to thier intellectual level by
switching  to normal  Elvish and Erudite... not many of these so called
intellectual races actually pursue their own cultural heritages!
