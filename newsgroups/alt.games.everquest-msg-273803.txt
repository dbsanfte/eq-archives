Onyxia definitely qualifies.  She's the easiest raid in the game,
and no US guild has beaten her yet (Conquest got her to ~20%
IIRC).

Ragnaros (sp?) was supposed to be in at release as well, but I
don't know if he made it and no one has attempted it, or if he
didn't make release.

As much as I like WoW, and am glad they released so I could play,
I think they needed about 4-6 more months of beta (in a perfect
world) to get more raids in, battlegrounds and hero-classes.  Then
this would be a moot point.
