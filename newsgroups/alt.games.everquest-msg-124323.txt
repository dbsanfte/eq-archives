I played a Half-Elf Ranger, starting in Kelethin first, and then eventually
played a DE Necro and after Kelethin, Neriak was cake.  Found my way around
the entire city in around 40 mins of playing, and became quick getting to
destination after just a couple days of playing.  Kelethin, I was lost for
days till I spent an hour drawing out a map.  Yes, I know eqatlas has a map,
but I found it easier to draw it, making it stay in my head more.  After
that I seldom got lost in Kelethin, and after a few weeks never had to look
at the map again.  Of course now that I've been playing my Iksar Monk for 31
levels, if I went back to Kelethin I'd be a lost newbie again.  :(
