I have a 25th Pally and have noticed that, while I do more damage per hit
(I am a 2h sl fanatic) and against undead, my ward spell does about 75%
of my FULL damage to undead, a cleric is close in damage to me and has
higher level spells to do damage with. This is against undead. Had a race
one time with a cleric of the same lvl. When he started an undead, I started
an equivelent one. Both hitting and warding, and he finished WAY ahead
of me.  But in a non-undead battle I seem to be MUCH faster than clerics.
