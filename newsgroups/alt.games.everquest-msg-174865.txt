Nah, he's got quite a few levels yet where he can easily kill blue-con
melee mobs.  He just needs a group or a suitable partner to kill casters
(if multiple casters need Harmony/Lull and/or mez to do it reliably as
a duo).  If he wants to keep soloing (Ranger can solo into 50s), he'll
just have to suck it up and take a death or two learning which mobs he
can and can't kill, just like so many of the rest of us have.
