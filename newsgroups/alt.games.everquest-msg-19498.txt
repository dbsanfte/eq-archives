Don't get fancy thoughts about a quest robe though. I'm a mage and my quest
robe .. well.. sucks. By the time I got my first of the three pieces I
already had a robe that was about as good (Green Silken Drape). Then I heard
that the other 2 pieces required a good balanced group of lvl 35-40. This
was at a time that I was lvl 32 and did not want to hear stuff like this.

Now I'm 35 and had a nice group of around my level and got me an Advisor
Robe which is plain better. I don't think this group would have gotten the
2nd piece of my quest robe though. let alone the third piece. So far that
item.

The other quest equipment I can get are almost all surpassed by my current
equipment and I'm still nowhere near completing any of them (Saw a lvl 37
mage with backup of 2 guildies of lvl 40+ camp CT for 3 full days straight
for an item for one of the equipment pieces. And my current one is way
better!).

Be lucky to be a wizard because your items are actually useful. Even a bit
above the levels at which you can get them

I'm just grateful I have my focus item quests which are plain necessary to
get so I am still inclined to do some questing. Might go for that mystic
cloak as well, one of these days.
