First of all - what I wrote here is bullshit... I have found out myself and
various people have pointed out.

Super secret, huh? That's about the first thing I found out about them when
researching on the web. I appreciate the tip, but fact is:
For an ultravision race like DEFs this glow is near to not visible even when
you KNOW it's there - I had non UV races help me in the hunting and THEY
could not tell for sure wether a wurm carried a bile or not - To many
reflections
from velium crystals and the river. And they both said they had seen glowing
wurms before and thus also stated that of course they had dynamic lighting
enabled,
exactly like I have it all the time.
And inside the caves I cannot hunt very good at 51 - I can kill like 4 or 5
wurms,
at least if I get only one ancient - and then I have to leave and med up.
I much prefer to just kill EVERY wurm outside on the southern plain.

Really - the "glowing wurms" tip is _useless_ to ultravision races.
Anyone knowing else please prove me wrong...
