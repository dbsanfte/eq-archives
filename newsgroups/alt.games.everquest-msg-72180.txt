I would think the efficiency of having such a pet whooping up on mobs would
more than make up for the itsy bitsy bit of xp the pet would eat up...

When my cleric groups with pet classes, he tries to make sure the pets are

and the longer the pet lives, the more beating it can take, and the less
healing I'll have to do in the midst of the fray.....
