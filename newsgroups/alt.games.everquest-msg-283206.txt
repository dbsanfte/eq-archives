When EQ originally came out, it had very little competition.  Now it
seems like everyone and his cousin is releasing an MMO.  So far, WoW
is the only game that's been a megahit successor to EQ.  It's
certainly not impossible that Vanguard will be that next megahit, but
the odds are pretty slim.

As far as "Vanguard is the most anticipated game in history", would
you mind giving a reference for that?
