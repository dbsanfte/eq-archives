I keep recommending Mozilla 1.0 because it seriously is the *best* 
browser available at the moment. Its fast, fully featured and free. The 
only problem being you have to install Java and other plugins 
seperately, and if this is a concern then use Netscape 7 Pre-Release 1 
which is based on Mozilla 1.0.

Yes Netscape 6.0 was an absolute horror, but Netscape 6.1 and 6.2 
improved significantly. Netscape 6.2X is still much better than IE. Once 
Netscape 7 final is released definately give it a go (unless you're 
already using Mozilla instead).

There are quite a few Mozilla 1.0/Netscape 7 features I now can't browse 
without!
