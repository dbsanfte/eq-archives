The root of the problem IMSHO, is what you have already stated...
Language barrier.  With that, the above statement could have been
taken as   "since the Chanter isn't doing his job, I had to do my own
personal Ghetto Mez, lucky I saved the day"
Now, I dint think that is what you were saying, but I work with "Alot"
of individuals from other countries (i'm from USA) and some things I
say tounge in cheek are not received that way, and I end up having to
explain (not always easy in a chat forum as in EQ)
I don't feel you did anything wrong... in fact you sound like the kind
of cleric I like to emulate.

Good hunting
