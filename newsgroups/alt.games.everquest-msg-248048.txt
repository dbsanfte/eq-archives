I'm assuming that you're talking about the level 65 crowd when you say

Exp isn't any worse in LDoN if you have a group of 5 lvl 65s and one
58. All the mobs will still be the same level, that doesn't change
unless the average level of the group drops to 62.  

The real question is, why would you want to invite anyone under lvl 65
into that kind of a group since, as you point out below, it's all too
easy to find a lvl 65 that's LFG and pretty much any lvl 65 will be
more useful in LDoN than a lvl 60. At 65, you don't need any
particular class to do (normal) LDoN although for all but the most
Uber groups, you will want a cleric for a 65 hard but that's not
something where you'd take a lvl 60 cleric. 

Usually the only reason to take a lvl 60 into LDoN is because it's a
friend. 

>2 - Alot of people only want to do planes.

Except for a very few exceptions, it's where the good exp is once you
get past level 60. I can think of one spot in Kunark where the exp is
about equivalent to tier 3 PoP. Since the revamp you might be able to
add a couple of GoD zones to that list.

Well, you can always point out to them that BoT is a cesspool <g> but
if you're going to go through the mind-numbing tedium of exping in
PoP, you might as well go where the good exp is, which usually means
tier 3+ once you get to 65. If you don't plan to raid, you might want
to spend some time before you get to 65 in PoStorms working on your
tactics key. Getting a group up for PoS desert shouldn't be too
difficult.

Even better exp than tier3 PoP and you can actually get loot.

Your average player that lvled to 65 in PoP is gonna be undergeared
and broke. Maybe see if you can entice them elsewhere with promises of
Phat Lewt? I know I can talk my friends into heading to a good money
camp even if the exp is mediocre. 

If people want to stay in PoP, try getting up a group for Crypt of
Decay. Exp is close to Tier 3, decent item drops are plentiful and you
never really need to go past the zone line since it's always empty.
You just need a tank good enough to handle unslowable mobs that hit
for around 700.
