My advice is to keep the Necro, and learn to play him VERY well. 16 levels
is a big investment in time and effort, unless you are a secondary
character, and if you were, you wouldn't need to ask this question. Any
class will be welcome if they are well played. Druids, Necromancers and
Mages are such talented solo characters that they often lack the skills to
contribute to a group. However, all three can be huge a huge part of any
group, and not just for SoW, corpse location and free food. If you play your
character to the best of his abilities, players will remember you and you
will not have trouble finding a group.

P.S. If you love the zaps, play the Wizard, you probably won't like an
Enchanter. Enchanters are great, the make everyone around them better, but
they are a support character. Wizards get huge DD, teleports and evacs, I've
never seen one having trouble finding a group, unless maybe it was a choice
between one and an Enchanter ;)
