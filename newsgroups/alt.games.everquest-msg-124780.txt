Well, one way would be for all waiting clerics to submit their names, then
have a trusted nuetral person (read cleric with their own damn epic and
a very good rep) randomly order the list and post it to the web, then
keep it updated from there as each new cleric submits their name to
be added to the tail end.

On Morell Thule, you send a screenshot of yourself with your
shimmering/swirling pearl (Swirling conversion is relatively
trivial so either counts) showing you are ready for Ragefire, and
you get put on the list.  If your level 10 cleric can get a  pearl,
he can certainly get on the list, and really thats the most practical
way to do this if its an uberguild alt...

On MT, there is a 3 hour grace period, then Ragefire becomes FFA.  This
is fairly rare however, when you -know- you are the next up, you get
your buddies to camp in the zone 24/7, SF is a nice exp zone anyway,
and as long as there's someone online with your phone number your odds
aren't too bad of being reachable when he pops.

Up to 3 hours yes.  But your guild would have to be brain dead to have
a raid scheduled during the roughly 3 day interval when -your- Ragefire
will pop.  Unless its a raid on SF of course, which isn't a bad idea. Split
into exp groups and lock down the entire zone!

Ragefire, YOUR Ragefire that is, pops during a 3 day span, not counting
the "middle of my span" patch that resets the timer.  Helping other people
camp Rage is nice on your part, but has nothing at all to do with getting
-your- epic.

On MT, if you miss your spawn, you are still next on  the list.  You could
miss 10 spawns in a  row and -still- be next on the list.  This would mean
for a month Rage was essentially FFA (only 3 hours after each pop)

Its possible but seems silly.  If guilds have anything to do with it
at all, then there should certainly be a rotation involved... guilds
don't NEED 10 epic clerics, they Need one... after they get
their first the rest are gravy.  Unfortunately, clerics aren't slaves,
they can easily leave guilds and join others... so a guild based
rotation isn't necessarily all that fair.

Not much.  Gank any calender/rotation they may be on, don't
help them out on CRs or raids... actually the few guilds to
buck the system on MT seem to break up shortly thereafter,
but I think that the principle agents in that breakup are
internal dissention (many member do -not- like being in a guild
that thwarts the MT community) and the fact that a guild
willing to break community rules is filled with people just
as likely to trample on guild politics.

Good question.  Ultimately a decision has got be made and then scrupulously
adhered to.  On MT, the rule is "send a pic of your Pearl" which means that
when you get Ragefire you get your epic... instead of gettting the drop because
you are next on the list, but may still have weeks or months of camping (if
you are a casual player) before you see the clicky stick.

I don't understand your statement.  However, anyone is in position to
create a fair entry test... and anyone can also create an unscrupulously
biased one.  What you need is someone everyone trusts.  Another good
idea is to use the judicial concept of precedence... use a system that
works on another server.

To some extent EQ is a community style game.  While its possible
to contest every spawn, every zone, every mob... things are a lot
more fun when you can work things out.  Want to go raid (POG,
POF, Hate, ToV... whatever) but every time you drag your whole
raid force in there you discover its been cleaned out?  Wouldn't it
be nice to be able to say "ok, wednesday at 10pm EST we go
to POA" and have everyone know that's really what will be going
on, instead of just hoping the zone hasn't been raided recently?

Any one spawn is certainly gankable by anyone, and Verant only
enforces their incredibly lame PnP rules.... but living on a server where
rotations and calenders are respected is -much- less hassle

Truth is it doesn't matter all that much... its just a hassle.  Things
are easier if you get along.  And history on MT has shown that
guilds that don't play nice tend to crumble.  But I think its probably
because a guild that acts like asses is likely people at least in
part by asses, and the assholier than thou don't tend to work
and play well together (big surprise)  External pressure probably
has relatively little effect on this.

Its not a PvP server, theres little you can legally (under PnP) do to
force anyone to do anything.

If you try something like this in a vacuum you aren't going to have
much luck.  If the only rotation/list on your server is the Rage
one, then its easy to see how "get our cleric his clicky now and
then who cares" is going to become the rule of the day.  IF the
Rage list is only one part of a whole web of "nice and fair" arrangements,
and IF its clearly being administered fairly and impartially, then
you have community standards.  Clerics tend, in my experience,
and excepting a few jerks and DE, to be the sort attracted to
nice and fair... after all they chose a carreer consisting mostly
of helping other people do things.
