Sentinel... is SUPPOSED to be used as a warning spell, back when you had to
look at 'the book' to med.

Also an effect on a Wiz(?) staff (bugged) that fires off if you're around
too many people... old bug, never been fixed.


Now you don't need to look in the book, EVER, I wish to hell they'd remove
the damn spell
