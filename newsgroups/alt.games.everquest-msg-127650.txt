Have you looked at the files?  They're pretty darn simple..

The first line is the friendly name of the zone ("Butcherblock Mountains"),
a short name ("Butcher"), and some coordinates that don't mean anything to

The rest of the lines are either 2d lines, 3d lines, points... Read the
MapFile.cs source file, you can see how simple they are to parse from that.
