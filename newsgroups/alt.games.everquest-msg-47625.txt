I have not been to the hole, nor is my rogue a halfling or a brell
worshipper, however, there are some mobs who are "bugged" that don't
change their con like they are supposed to.  High level undead such as
spectres, they don't see through rogue invis, but they still con
scowling (or did last I was in oasis with my rogue, they claimed to have
corrected some of this in a patch a looooong time ago), Some giants
don't change their con in old world as well.  Not sure the hole came out
post kunark IIRC, but it may have more old world type coding.  All I can
say is try to sneak past.  If as you say you got close and it didn't
attack I would say it's probably a miscon of scowling.
