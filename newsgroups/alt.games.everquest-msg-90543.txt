It gets old pretty fast. Unlike when you are low level and new,
eventually you have a very large experience point penalty and the need
to find someone to resurrect. It is those things coupled with also
having to possibly make a long run to your corpse, shouting for
resurrect help on the way, which gets people down. Couple this with
the fact that the further you get in the game the harder it is to get
someone out to where you need a resurrect, if you are someone who does
not like to hang around in a 3 deep pile in Sol B or lower guk. 

This is the everquest TRIPLE death penalty. There are various ways to
make it so its not always triple but depending on your class it very
likely is going to be most of the time. Clerics only have a double
death penalty for the most part from 49 and up, with 39 making it much
easier to take. At level 10 journeying 2 zones to where you died and
easily looting your corpse is trivial since you don't even notice the
experience point loss.

That changes for you pretty fast also ;) Eventually there are large
time management problems where you can't port but someone in this far
off zone wants you to come group with their group. This is where you
will be begging for transportation since the 1 hour plus journey will
not seem like a worthwhile effort and that group would no longer have
a spot for you. 

The nexus makes this easier, but there are still some places that it
does not really help with. If you are in the nexus and someone wants
to group with you in the hole or velks, its made much easier. If you
are there and they want to group with you in Seb or SolB its not. If
you had to you could take the nexus to dreadlands and run to seb but
its going to be a bit of a trip still.
