I am not worried about going oom in one fight, but over several. These
young casters these days (in keeping with your grumpy oldtimer motif
below :-p ), they get so used to the badass KEI mana regen and don't
have any experience with regulating their output. What happens? They
go too low, and then aren't available for much in the next fight. If
its someone serious, this could mean downtime - and I *hate* downtime
in exp groups.

However, be that as it may, and as I said I wasn't declaring it to be
the sole case, but a disturbing trend, I won't push it. I just have to
say when someone's 'expert' advice on how to hunt involves "beg
someone for a KEI" it really makes me wonder. Sure, they all *say*
they can hunt just as well without KEI...

I don't necessarily agree; I think it very much depends on the person
in question.

Sometimes it just comes naturally. :-p As I said, that little "oh and
get yourself a KEI" really rubbed me the wrong way. I certainly never
had any problem getting to 60, often soloing and very fast, before KEI
was put in; why should it be necessary now? Oh well.
