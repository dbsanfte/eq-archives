Sounds quite similiar to my wife's route, except for the child care..
She started out as a volunteer for Head Start.  Been with the program
now for going on 15 years...

Well, let's examine HIV....  What does the average person think of
when someone says HIV or AIDs...

In other words, 2 yr olds don't live on Sesame St...  What occurs when
your two year old gets into a "discussion" (since it is your position
that 2 yr olds CAN have "discussions") and is given the "street
lesson" about AIDS and HIV???

So, you are going to tech your 2 yr old about only a SMALL portion of
what HIV is all about and leave out all the sexual parts of it,
correct?

Why???

If your 2 yr old can handle the discussion about HIV, surely he or she
is ready to start High School sex ed, eh??

Where do you draw the line??

So, when your 2 yr old comes to you and says, "Mommy, they have this
HIV monster on Sesame St and Billy down the street says you get HIV
from having sex.  What is sex???"

What will your response be to this 2 yr old???

OK  Let me rephrase.  Why defend the choice of AIDs and HIV as an
example of teaching tolerance..

And yes, I certaintly feel that teaching a child of 2 yrs old about
HIV and AIDs is not appropriate.

Just as I feel that sex education shouldn't be taught at that age.
