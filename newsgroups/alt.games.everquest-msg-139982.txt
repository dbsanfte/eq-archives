 Am I missing something?

Probably.  I think the spell is called Atone is it not?  Anyhow, you are
missing the amount of mana the cleric would have to use to PL someone.  Mem
Blur for chanters is not that mana intensive but is still costly to nuke a
monster down mem blur and repeat, its not the fastest process.  Same thing
for a cleric.  The most effective use of this spell is when someone in your
group aggroes something while fleeing, you could cast it on the mob and you
would be able to run away again.  Well maybe not the most effective use, but
at least one.
