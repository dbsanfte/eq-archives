It depends on how you want to play your bard. If you want to be a
semi-tank with songs, put points into STR and DEX.  You should also
put enough points into STA to get over the critical point.  (I think
it's 70, someone will surely correct if I'm mistaken.)  If you want to
be more of a instrument-weilding bard, CHA helps some, as does AGI.  
When I created my bard (my first and still main character) I put
points into CHA, DEX, and AGI, with most going to AGI.  (OK, I know it
was dumb but the manual said that AGI helped with songs.)  
I have run through a lot of different stat gear in my time, and the
gear that makes the noticable difference in melee was always DEX gear.
When I was dual-weilding Ykeshas in my late 30s I could get 2-3 procs
per battle when my DEX was above about 120.  I found myself procing
more than all the other tanks in my group combined if I got DEX boosts
to put me up around 150 DEX.  Boosting STR would have allowed me to
hit for slightly more, maybe 1-2% overall, certainly not anywhere near
the damage my YK procs were doing.  
In my upper-20s when I started using songs that really required CHA I
*think* I convinced myself that CHA does make a difference especially
with charm.  If I was wearing my tank-stat gear and tried to charm
something, I almost alwasy noticed the problem immediately, since I
was getting resists and premature breaks.  I could quickly swap out a
couple items, get CHA up over 120, and be back in business.  On the
other-hand, I often tanked for quite a while before I realized that I
have my CHA on rather than tanking gear.  (Basically I swing CHA, DEX,
and STR about 20 points depending on the gear.)
I can't think of any reason to boost STR other than the fact that
bards are plate classes and plate is heavy.  My unbuffed, naked STR is
75 I think, and I often found myself encumbered much too soon.  I've
learned to work around it, and have just resigned myself to only
wearing lightweight armor, or heavier armor that has a STR boost equal
to the weight. 
The one that I have never really been able to figure out is AGI.
Verant used to say that high AGI helped with less missed notes, but I
think they've backed off from that now.  My AGI is higher than any
other bard I've compared with, but I can't be sure that I get less
missed notes than others.  I *think* I do, and noticed last night on a
raid with a 56 bard and a 60 bard that they seemed to get more missed
notes than I do, but that may be song dependant.
Another thing to consider is something that came up on my guild
messageboard last night.  One of our memebers is a former MUD
programmer and he noted that Attack has both a 'to hit' number and a
'damage' number and that AC has a 'damage avoidance' and 'damage
absorb' componant, and the ratio is different for different classes.
He has not been able to figure out where bards sit on this scale, but
if they are mainly damage avoidance (lots of misses) then it makes
sense to boost AGI a bit more.  If bards are a damage absorb class,
then STA makes more sense.
Anyway, this is a really, really long post that is much more in-depth
than anyone could want, so I'll sum up with an executive summary:

Get STA up to 70, STR to 80 and put the rest into CHA.  Unless you're
a human then boost AGI up to at least 80 and the rest into CHA.
