    I don't mind the one pick per mob - they need the skill to do
Ragebringer, and having played my rogue to 55 (my "u" key is nearly worn off
from capping Pick Locks) I know asking them to go sit in the newbie zones
picking the same Pawn over and over isn't right. What I DO object to are the
rogues that clean mobs as bare-bones as they can, or who put their Pick
Pockets skill in their Evade macro and think that makes it right somehow.
It's becoming moot now, anyways - look at all the Luclin mobs that only drop
a cash item tagged MAGIC to stop PP.

    I remember one time in tents where the main tank was looting a fair
amount, but he always dropped the scalps. I made sure to pick them up before
anyone else could figure out what he was doing, and made a TON of cash that
trip (above and beyond the fair cash from selling bags of Spider Fur items).
