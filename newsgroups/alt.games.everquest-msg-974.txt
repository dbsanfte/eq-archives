Ive been in many groups where people freak out about this. Heres something
to consider: How much XP is he going to LOSE because you have no cleric and
he dies? In a perfect world yes everyone would be within 5 level of each
other.....but in the real world (Er EQ world anyway) you take what you can
get because  its not risk the loss of XP if you die. BTW in my opinion 20 is
WAY to low to be fighting most mobs in ill omen like recruits, warlord,
charbones, etc. I got in a group when i was 20 (necro) and the mobs were so
high above me i couldnt even land a lifetap! So thats something to consider
if your worried about levels, yer lvl 20 may not have been able to even hit
alot of these mobs.
More appropriate mobs for a 20 can be found at the windmill/north beach....
