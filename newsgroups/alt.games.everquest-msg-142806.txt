Bringing up my deadbeat relatives was not to point out that it was
either good or bad not to pay your taxes, but simply that it is
possible to get away without doing.  I don't believe it's the right
thing to do, not pay your taxes.  As a matter of fact I feel that if
you are going to participate and benefit from living in our society
you should be willing to pay your taxes.  Hell, I don't mind giving
30% of what I make to Uncle Sugar.  I'd be willing to give more.  I
just don't particularly like the way they spend it.

It works, just not well.  Capitalism, in and of itself, gives a
disproportional amount of power to those with Money.

Unfortunately, for every Henry Ford there is also a Preston Tucker.

Pariah, maybe not.  But they were not viewed as equals.  This is still
true today, just to a lesser extent.

No, the large middle class was built later than that, mostly in the
late 50's early 60's when the US was fat and happy.  The thirties,
WWII, and the recession of the 50's just smacked EVERYBODY down.

Trust me, as bad as it is in the Navy, it was worse in the sweatshops

Understandable, and probably wise, but by all accounts, THE JUNGLE is
a fairly accurate, if slanted depiction of what it was like to work in
a slaughterhouse back then.

I think I have been VERY explicit in my denouncing socialism.  I don't
think it works as a 'pure' form of government.  That doesn't mean that
some socialist programs to prop up the weaknesses of capitalism are
bad.  For the most part, using a hybrid of the two is a much stronger
system, if still far from perfect.

>Capitalism is the best system over the entire spectrum of personalities.

Not when used alone.  All it does is create a disproportional
stratification of the 'economic classes' and places the power into the
hands of people based solely on the fact that they have a lot of
money.

Social Security is a good thing, just not necessarily the way it's
implemented now.  My main gripe is that I'll never see a dime of it by
the time I get of age, and if I do, my kids are going to be royal
butt-fucked (pardon my french) paying for it.

Welfare is not bad, in and of itself.  People DO fall on hard times,
and need some help.  Hard to find a job in a recession.  The problem
with welfare is that we have created a caste (shush, it's a good word
:-) ) that lives off it.  The whole point is for it to be something
that helps people until they can help themselves.  A temporary thing.

Welfare need to be scrapped and we need to start over again on it.

I'm sorry, I'm a cynic.  My mantra is "People are stupid".  That's
people as a group, not as a group of individuals.  Until things get
DANGEROUSLY bad, they won't do shit.  It's easier to just bitch.
