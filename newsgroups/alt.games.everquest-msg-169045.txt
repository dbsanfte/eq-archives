PoG is where we have been the last couple of weeks.  There is a single
static mob at zone in and it does not see invis.  We have been running with
as few as 4 people in a group, and having no trouble as long as there are no
major add issues.

Othere than the named trees and Tunare, a single group can do the whole zone
if careful.  You can even do it without  a slower, but down time is greater.
