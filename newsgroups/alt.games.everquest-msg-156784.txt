IMPLEMENTATION: The process of bringing new software live.

IMPLEMENTESTING: The process of finding a bunch of 'oh shits' after
implementation and sweating your genitals off to fix them, whilst a bunch a
angry users wanting/needing access to your application call every 30 - 90
seconds to check the status of Implementesting.

Hope this helps!
