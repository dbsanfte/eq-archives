I usually ask people to provide the name of an officer, or even better the
name of the guild leader so that I can have a quick word with them.

This usually results in one of several options,

1. person goes anon and leaves (chuckle and continue playing)
2. person goes anon and gets worse (chuckle and /report /petition)
3. person apologises and things get sorted (chuckle and continue playing)
4. person provides information, and then suddenly, for no obvious reason,
after you've had a conversation with the guild person in question, leaves
(chuckle and continue playing).

Sometimes, guilds appear to be full of people like them, and they do
nothing, not much to do then other than ignore them and move on.
