Hmm I'll show my ignorance here..............
What do these registry entries actually do?I reformatted my HD,reinstalled
windows then just copied a backup of my EQ folder back to the Programs
directory.Everything works fine as I expected as I heard EQ was fully self
contained.
I'm still learning about the registry and how it works so any info in
laymans terms is appreciated.
(In particular will the absence of these entries have a detrimental effect
on the running of the game?)
In my ignorance they appear to just be mapping shortcuts or giving a path
for the programs start bar...../shrug.
