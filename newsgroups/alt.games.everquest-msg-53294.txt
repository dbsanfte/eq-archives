10. I agree but it does not bother me. I tell my close friends.

9. Had this happen to me but the other way around. Had a level 30 something
look at my equipment at the giant fort in FM one time then started yelling
at the zone that I was a twink. The whole zone started laughing at her.
Druids have lots of resources for PP and gear so they started making fun of
her for not having the gear she should have had for her level.

8. I totally agree. Ranks right up there with the use of the phrase "my bad"
=(

7. very annoying and could get you on a lot of ignore lists

6. punishable offense even if you do not think it is.

5. get a map like everyone else. Hehe favorite response I hear is always
"ask your wife" or "find a gas station" =)

4. plenty of these classes out there and if they piss me off then I will
piss them off. Being nice to an asshole will never get you any where.

3. I consider this like a dog sniffing people's crotches or another dog's
butt and tell them so.

2. Well if it is cute =). If it is just plain stupid then yea.

1. I will never give a beggar of pp or gear any thing. I have given out
plenty of free gear to players I see struggling in the field fighting but I
will never give a beggar PP or gear. Now asking nice for buffs I feel is a
little different. Especially SoW for a corpse run. Just do not get upset if
someone says no and thank them anyway.
