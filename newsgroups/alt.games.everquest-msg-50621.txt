Yes there are. Root a SG, throw 2 dots at it, wait untill they both stop. See
how much HP he lost (true, cant see precisely, but you can get pretty close).
Finish him off.

Find another SG, snare, throw the same 2 dots at it, and run around without
doing anythign to it, untill dots run out. Check how much HP he lost. Youll see
he loose a good deal more HP while rooted.
