}I have never seen anything override low health aggro.  If you're on

Yea, the *3 may be low, I was meaning to convey a notion of -at least- *3. 
:)  I have on occasion not gotten low health aggro when I was fairly far 
from the mob, though, so I doubt it's much over (/em reaches in butt) *10?

}It's also worth noting that some mobs pay a lot more attention to
}proximity than others (most undead are easily distracted by a target
}in melee range), some mobs don't seem to care all that much about
}sitting (lowbie mobs in particular, seen many a caster sit at a
}Crushbone or Deathfist Orc's feet while the melees pound on it),
}while some mobs have a special dislike for PCs who dare to sit in
}their presence (Faydedar is legendary for this).

But also, those rare instances may have been mobs that didn't much care 
about low health. :)
