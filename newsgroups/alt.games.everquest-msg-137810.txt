    First he asks for some mushroom parts of some sort. They're off either
the Deepspore mushrooms or the non-KOS one - I think the Deepspore, don't
shoot me if I'm wrong. Then he asks for some memories or emotions or some
such thing. What he wants are the three different types of spheres (Pain,
two others I can't recall) off the Thought Horrors. Give him those and he
tells you how the bridge is fake, walks across the invisible bridge and
despawns.

    Me, I DA and jump. The person leaving shattered hammers on the bridge
always manages to curve them so either the handles or the shafts are
sticking over the edge, and then someone will pick them up for kicks.
