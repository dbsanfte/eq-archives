Not just reading it, seeing it in action in a pickup group in Sebilis.
Until the second Warrior left and was replaced by a Rogue, the Cleric's
damage output (UHOF + SummonedHammerOfInsaneProcRate) was needed to
allow us to keep up with the spawns (we were at chef, and pulling other
mobs whenever we were caught up with the spawns we were camping).  This
was a 56 Cleric, not 60, and she made a very noticeable difference to
the speed of our kills (group was 59 Warrior, 56 Enchanter, 56 Cleric,
53 Paladin (me), 53 Warrior, 5? Wizard).  She also kept everybody
standing when a froggie Enchanter managed to get the 59 Warrior, me, and
the Enchanter all mezzed at once, which was the only time we were ever
at any real risk of being wiped.  (Was a fun battle, the frog charmed me
at the start, that wore off in a couple seconds, then the frog resisted
several of my stuns and a mez as it mezzed the Enchanter, the Warrior,
and me.  Then the Wizard managed to land a couple nukes on the frog and
it was just a matter of the Cleric keeping us all alive until the mezzes
broke.)

Personally, I'd gladly take any of the priest classes as a healer, so
long as the player is skilled (at high level) or willing and able to
learn (at lower levels).  Part of what makes a group effective, and
makes grouping fun, is being able to adapt tactice to suit the strengths
of the group members.  When you're rigid about group composition you're
likely to be equally rigid about fighting tactics, both are stupid IMO.
