Every once and a while when I zone i end up in the next zone and my whole
screen goes blank except for the view screen.  All the buttons around it are
black.  If I put the cursor over it and click on options it goes back to
normal.

 I had a 32mb nvidia Geforce card with burned out.  I got a new one same
kind.  So i thought it was just the card going bad.  Well it still does it.
I have the newest drivers and it just started doing it about 4 or 5 patches
ago.

Anyone else having this problems.
