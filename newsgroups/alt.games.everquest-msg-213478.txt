One of the best class descriptions I've come across. I wish I'd have
had it when I first started playing. Then again, I think almost all
the classes would be fun to play.

The only thing I'd add, is that once you pick a class, head over to
one of the EQ sites to learn more about the available races, the
available stats and special abilities (or lack thereof).

Also do a google search on your choice in this group and see what kind
of experiences people have, where they go hunt, and what websites they
use for information. There is an overwhealming amount of details to
learn about EQ; these websites will be your salvation.

Here are some of my personal favourites:
http://www.eqatlas.com           (maps)
http://www.eqmaps.com            (maps)
http://www.eqtraders.com         (skill info)
http://everquest.allakhazam.com  (quests, and lots of other info)
http://eq.castersrealm.com       (general, good info for picking races
IMHO)
http://lucy.fnord.net            (spells)
http://www.magelo.com            (character profiles)

Also, if you haven't already bought EQ, they are about to release a
new edition that will include all expansions for about $30
(Evolution?), so it may be worth to wait a couple weeks or so (not
sure on the exact dates).

Enjoy!
