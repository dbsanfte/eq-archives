The guards in WFreeport drop items that are turned in as part of a 
quest.  If you make them unkillable, you kill that quest.  For that 
matter, if you make them not aggro, like the Felwith guards, then you 
make killing Sir Lucan much easier.  Or impossible, since he's also one 
of those guards.

Most guards in the game are really more annoying than helpful.  There 
are a few guards which had their hp and damage output boosted up to very 
high levels; gate guards for the cities; making them not attackable 
might help except that few people kill them since they are deliberately 
underconned and not worth the effort.  And would also reduce the 
challenge of moving into cities where your faction sucks; if they won't 
attack you then you don't need to worry about them.

I think, in fact, that there should be more guard killing; cities are 
big interesting zones which are really wasted on us since few ever hunt 
in them.  Killing "friendly" guards may be illogical, but going and 
hunting the "bad guys" (or those self righteous twits in the "good" 
cities) seems right in character and should, IMO, be encouraged not 
discouraged.

Quest mobs are another issue, and in most cases I'd completely agree 
with you; these mobs shouldn't be killable in general.
