I ran into the local file io errors. it says hard drive may be full
etc.

In my case, the problem was that the patcher had aborted previously
and left a copy of itself running -- LOCKING some of the files so that
another patcher copy could not function.

I used control-alt-del and in win2k, i deleted the everquest.exe
process, then patcher download properly with no errors.

in win98 c-a-d should also show everquest running and just delete all
everquest copies and try to rerun patcher.

worse case, reboot system then all local files will be unlocked
