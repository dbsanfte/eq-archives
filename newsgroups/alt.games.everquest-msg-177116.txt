The fact that macro programs help is a sign of how badly designed
tradeskilling in eq is. I hope that EQ 2 or SWG is more enjoyable than eq
tradeskills. The fact is that a lot of the time you are just doing things
certified to be injurious to your health, with no fun intrinsic to it, and
little monetary reward until you hit very high levels; and a strong bias
towards ultra high level people with huge quantities of cash who can 1) max
wis or int or whatever 2) get everything from the bazaar 3) use a broadband
connection to stay online 4) 2 box so mule can sit around acting as a
vending machine whilst actual play takes place elsewhere 5) beat up the arch
demon lord Zhuffles five million times who drops the no-drop ingredients/
skill enhancer needed to train skills quickly.

A good game would have traders whose trade would be as exciting and
innovative as the merchants running spices across the globe, or who ran
about in the city organising the creation of goods and dickering for the
trade of things. It should be dynamic and human.
