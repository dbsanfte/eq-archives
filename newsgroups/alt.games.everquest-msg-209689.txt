Most such quests were intended to be done by a group.  Were you in a group
of four to six individuals of like level, you would have likely found it a
fun fight.  With a KEI, you were able to do it solo.  As for the quality of
the mace - the Dark Ember is, I believe, a Velious weapon.  If you're doing
the original quests, your weapon is several expansions old.  It's what we
call Mudflation - Multi User Dungeon Inflation - the theory that weapons get
better with each expansion.

Save the low, medium, and high quality pelts.  You can easily make or buy a
skinning knife to turn them all into low-quality pelts; combined with silken
thread, the leather padding sells well in the bazaar.
