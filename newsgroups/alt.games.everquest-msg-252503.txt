Great spell to have if you are doing Trials, as it can take out a mob
instantly.

Imbued gems for jewelry.  I've never been asked either.

Can be used to power level, farm faction, or duel. 
PL - Summon pet, have it do all the damage; Pet Hold and let the mob
wear itself out on the fire pet before the other character engages.
Farming faction - the pet runs out of mana and begins to melee -- the
runners will return (sometimes with friends) to die on the pet's DS.  
Duel - at least they resist fire and have a great DS.  The usually
cast a rune on themselves when told to Hold.  Once the rune is up,
reissue the attack command.
