It occurs to me that EQ doesn't care how I get the files.

The patcher compares what I have in my folder, downloads updates for
anything I don't have current versions of, and then goes on with the
process of loading the game.

Since I've already successfully played the game post patch, the problem
I have currently is centered  around the patcher being unable to
download some of the new files.

If this is correct, it seems to me that I could use FTP access to get
the missing files in their latest incarnations, and make the patcher
happy.

Of course Verant in their infinite wisdom isn't making those files
accessable via FTP, unless someone more savvy about such things can
point me to their location.

But if someone else out there in EQ land will put a copy of a
successfully downloaded eqgame.exe and eqgfx_dx8.dll on a web site for
FTP, or at least email it to me as an attachment, I could test that
theory out, and perhaps get back online.  I"ve seen several other people
complaining about the same thing happening, perhaps we can put together
a workaround for all of them, instead of waiting the inevitable week or
two for Verant to get around to addressing this issue.
