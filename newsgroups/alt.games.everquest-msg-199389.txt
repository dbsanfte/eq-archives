The 75 dex is more for casters.  If you are under 75 dex, you won't channel
for crap.  Above that point, you have a much better chance of channeling a
gate through a mob beating on you.

There is a difference on the rate of skill-ups, but unless you are PL'ing it
isn't enough of a difference to be an issue.

Stamina's breakpoint is at 100.  You can visibly observe the effect of
having stamina under 100.  For melees that is, casters just use stamina for
hp.
