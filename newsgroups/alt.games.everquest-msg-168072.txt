I suspect if someone did a survey and found out who reneged on the deal,
youd find over 90% of the people wanting the port, and 10% the druid/wiz.
Ive paid for many ports with alts and done may ports with my druid, and not
once have I paid for a port and not got it. Otoh, ive had many people not
pay for their ports. I dont bother insisting on money for ports, since its
not much money, but for multiquests when im charging several k, I always
insist on at least 80% payment up front.
Actually, I never seem to have any trouble with getting people to trust me
with MQ's anyway.
