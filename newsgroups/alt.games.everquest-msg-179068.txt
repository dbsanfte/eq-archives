Give the guy a prize, he's right.  I'm not jealous of bards, and I don't have
one.  But I do have a druid, and I've always thought the same thing when people
are ragging druids.

I don't kite multiple mobs because frankly I think it's scary as hell.  But, if
someone pulled *my* giant while I *was* kiting him I'd be mad.
