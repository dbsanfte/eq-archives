Stuff wasn't ready. lvl 70 means a huge amount of rebalancing,
editing, adjusting and simply adding stuff. There was no way they
could finish it before the 5th anniversary.
In fact, the developers said they couldn't do it properly in time for
the OoW launch. When SoE woke up and started listening to their
developers and players they realized it would be best to have a lot
more time to rebalance everything before launching lvl 70 and pushed
OoW launchdate back.

Just think of the current state. They are just designing and balancing
66-70 spells now. Not to mention they haven't decided what to do with
focus items, skillcaps and more of those things. If OoW launched on
the original published date it would mean it was about now in open
beta (if they would even have a beta) while half of the work hasn't
even started yet.
