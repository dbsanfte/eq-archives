Nope, and there won't be.  EQ is heavily dependent on DirectX.  Microsoft 
will not port DirectX to the Mac, and Verant won't do a complete rewrite of 
the PC version to remove all references to DirectX (nor would any sane 
person expect them to).

The PC emulators available for the Mac do not support hardware graphics 
accelerator cards.   EQ requires those accelerator cards, so EQ will not 
work on the PC emulators.

In short, if you want to play EQ, you need a PC.
