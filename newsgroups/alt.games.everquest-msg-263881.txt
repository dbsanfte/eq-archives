I saw a stand-up comedian by the name of Basil who sang the song "Ain't 
Never Had a Friend Like Me" from Disney's animated feature, Aladdin. He 
also did repair voice-overs to fix old Bulwinkle cartoons. I honestly 
couldn't tell much of a difference. I think there will always be someone 
who can at least do a decent job in a patchwork capacity.

Not as much as one might think. As I mentioned above, there are 
possibilities.

I don't see this as the case. It has always struck me as a bit odd that 
there is a ton of audio in EQ but no speech at all from the NPC's. I think 
the key will be whether they do it right or not. I could easily see a 
scenario where there could be too much of it.
