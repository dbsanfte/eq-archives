Well, that's why I qualified my statement. I realize it's based on small 
quantities of data, so I could be wrong about how well the system handles 
the problem. But it doesn't appear to be working that well in practice 
today.

What exactly makes you think that? The Diablo 2 stress test had and equal 
number of players in it, a little over 100,000. And then on release day they 
had 2 million players trying to get in at the same time. Oops! I don't think 
there will be 2 million pre-orders of WoW, but I would not be surprised to 
find that there are more than 100,000.

And that's another thing, these things are happening now NOT just as a 
result of massive over crowding, I've never suggested that the problem was 
with too many players competing for the same mob. I think this is going to 
be problematic if even 2 or 3 players are competing for the same mobs.

I don't know how many quests there are, I guess there are a lot of them, but 
everyone was working on the same ones when I was playing. The shouts across 
the entire zone were all talking the same language: "Where does Goldfoot 
spawn", "where's Felix's Box", and so on. I'm not sure how many quests there 
are in any given area. Once you finish up a series, you're moved on to the 
next area and I constantely saw the same players moving around with me, 
whether I played a Dwarf, a Tauren or a Human (although it seemed there was 
a bigger variety for Humans).

Except I'm not describing massive overcrowding.

Well, in the situations I was witnessing (repeatedly), it was more like 
multiple players competing for the same kills, not multiple groups. That's 
probably just because these were all noob quests and people are still 
soloing a lot at that point. Maybe things will work differently when people 
are grouped and there is more peer pressure to be nice. Dunno.
