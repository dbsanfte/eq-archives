Oh come on CG, surely you've seen those little signs in businesses that 
read, "We reserve the right to refuse to do business with anyone"?

Now, if you can prove that they are refusing your custom beccause they 
discriminate agains gay zoroastrian filipino panda bears, you might have a 
case.  But they are allowed to discriminate against you for no reason at 
all.

{note: the above is not intending to imply in any way that you're a gay 
zoroastrian filipino panda.  It's just an example.}
