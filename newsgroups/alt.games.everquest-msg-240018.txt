...and you should expect to be because...? I'm just telling it like it is. 
If you enter an unfamiliar but well-established environment, you should 
pretty much expect to take great care in how you are perceived. I know I 
would.

You're still ignoring the reasons you have been met with some cynicism in 
the first place and they are valid. Influxes of this nature in the past 
have not necessarily produced stellar results. 

It's just unrealistic to expect people to always give you the benefit of 
the doubt right up front. I just hope the good ones stay and the bad ones 
don't. :)
