Under 50 bard haste does =not= stack.  Not until 50 do we see the first
"stacking" haste, and its good for an oh-so-impressive 5% more haste.  Bard plus
enchanter is a pair I see reccomended quite often in this newsgroup, but to my
thinking its one of the least useful combinations.  Bards are the third best
hasters, until high levels (53+) when they do become additional haste (at these
levels chanter plus bard is indeed the best haste you can get) and their other
principle function is crowd control, a job they also do less well than an
enchanter.  Bard melee contribution in the lower levels is decidedly sub par,
they don't tank well, they have terrible "burst" damage output, their fear is
decidedly worse than chanter fear... in short, in most groups, the classes don't
compliment each other, so much as the bard provides a feeble backup to the
chanter.  What the bard Can do that stacks with the chanter is provide mana,
this job, however, is perhaps the most boring one in all EQ.

The coming of KEI has been a blessing to the bard; now groups will accept a bard
instead of a chanter, since mana generally isn't a major issue, and if it is, he
has the stacking kind where the chanter does not.

bard also has mez and slow, although neither is as good as the chanters; on the
plus side, they take no mana, its a rare group where you'll be sitting on your
butts waiting because the bard is LOM.  Haste, Slow, Mez, Snare, will all always
be available, the only thing you'll ever be at risk of losing is charm ability.

Another area where bards shine is DOT killing single mobs.  They don't stack
well with other bards in this endeavor, but do with any other DOTing class,
sadly, here, enchanters come up very short.  Enchanter DOTs are decidely
substandard, and there's little they can do to help the bard out, other than
keep the mob rooted so the bard doesn't have to run circles around it.  While
this is very helpful, it can hardly be considered pulling their weight.

A third area where bards and enchanters share abilities is charm kiting.  At low
levels, chanter/bard charm kiting should be fantastic, as the chanter can buff
the bejeezus out of the pet, and the bard can keep it charmed forever.  Add in a
healer, and with good pet selection you should be able to cut a swath thru
anything.   Sadly, at higher levels, this collapses, as the higher level bard
charm uses mana.  Now, buffing a charmed pet becomes an inefficient use of
chanter mana, since the entire point of the pet is now that its' disposable;
while its doing damage to the target, the target is doing damage to it, so after
the target dies, you kill the pet for double the exp.   Rarely will a bard
charmed pet go thru more than a couple targets.  And charm kiting in general can
only be sustained for a relatively short time before mana gives out.  The
chanter can charm too, you say?  Well this is true, of course, but now you find
the flaw in the combo; all the wonderful things a bard can do for his group do
NOT apply to pets.  Best thing about a bard in this situation would be that he
can keep the chanter selo'd up so the poor guy can run away whenever charm
breaks!

Lets see, what else.  Fear kiting.  Here, the bard/chanter combo might work
out.  Bard snare is excellent, and mana free.  Chanter fear blows the doors off
bard fear.  Let the chanter get his pet on the mob, use his (superior) haste on
the bard as well, bard chases singing snare and three dots while doing melee
damage, and anyone else in the group does the same... not too shabby.  Of course
Any snare class would do for this, why not a ranger, druid, necromancer or hey,
a shadowknight... and as far as the chanter goes, well his fear is no better
than that of a cleric, and only a bit better than those of necros (substantially
better than SK fear, but even that is better than bard fear)  So yank the bard
and chanter both, and sub in a necromancer, who can do both jobs well!

I'd love to see some more input on how chanter/bard would actually be a potent,
rather than marginally acceptable, combination.
