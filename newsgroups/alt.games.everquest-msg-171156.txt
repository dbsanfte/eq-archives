I have to agreee.  I played a rogue for a while and she was very hard to
solo.  It is also hard to get them in groups sometimes because a lot of
people mistrust them and believe that you will pickpocket the MOBS the group
is fighting.  It used to take me and hour or more just to find a group to
fight in at times.

Another suggestion if you decide to switch to a new character is to use a
Tradeskill container to transfer gear to your new character if you don't
have any friends online that can help you.  You can use any of the public
Tradeskill items like, Pottery Wheel, Loom, Oven, or Kiln to put the items
in.  I recommend using one that is out of the way that will likely  not be
used by someone else.  The items you put in them will not decay like they
would if you left them on the ground and they are safer from wandering eyes.
