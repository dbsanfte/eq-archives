To me that would be frustrating, but in my opinion that effect also 
solidifies more of a feeling of being in the 'real world' (on the screen)  
Obviously today one can just carry a gps in their pocket and never get 
lost, but that just doesn't work for me in a fantasy type, or any other 
type, mmorpg.  It's a new world to explore, and having easy to see 
directional assistants, maps, radars, homing devices, etc. take away from 
that experience tremendously.

You had feelings of being lost, not sure which way to go?  Irritating, 
yes, but more realistic, un-nerving, worried, maybe even a tad scary? You 
were there, in those hills, just for a few moments, more than you were in 
the chair in front of the screen.

That's what's missing from almost all the games now.  Enjoy it!!!  :)

But I'll agree on one thing, having one guided to the appropriate npc's 
for quests is much better than having to talk to all of them.
