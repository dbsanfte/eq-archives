Seems to be maidens eye from what I have seen.  Got a few centi
longswords and sold them for 10k (lol what a rip) just because they
look cool.. *decent* stats too...  Anyone know of other good 50+
zones?  I haven't had a lot of time too explore and everyone always
says "Maidens Eye" is the place to go...
