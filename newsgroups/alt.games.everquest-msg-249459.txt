I personally like North Qeynos mainly for the mob drops that can be
good money for an untwinked newbie (they un-nerfed the plague rat
tails so they now sell for 1.5 pp each again; gopher snake poison sacs
and jawbones sell for for about 2 gold each and are stackable), and
the only mobs that aggro (for good races, at least) are gnoll pups
(and Fippy, of course), and sometimes the gnolls will drop backpacks
and bags which are handy.  

(note, sometimes some decaying skellies will aggro on you if they see
you fighting something else. and it seems like those skellies always
drop cloth armor).
