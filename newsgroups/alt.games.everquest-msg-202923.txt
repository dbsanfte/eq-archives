    Were you a tester, would you have tested KEI while grouped with the
caster with Wolfform? Or with any of the hundreds of other buffs available
to players that shouldn't get KEI? Would you have tested it on a horse? On a
horse, while drunk? On a horse, while drunk, with any of the hundreds of
other buffs available?

    Now, repeat all those tests for casting KEI directly on the player, and
for Mass Group Buff KEI. And you still haven't covered everything.

    I don't mind the oddball errors, as long as it doesn't look like a
logical consequence of something else they changed. KEI landing on people in
wolfform qualifies, to me, as an "oddball error". Even assuming it's true.
