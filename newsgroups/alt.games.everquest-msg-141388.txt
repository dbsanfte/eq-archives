Oh, yes. Much like the "aspect of fun" when the Idol of Rallos Zec bitch
slapped me a week ago.

/sigh

Yesterday we did Riff house. (Arena was camped.) Much better. None of
the aforementioned Idol bitch slapping, more than a half dozen plate
drops, plenty of dorf heads for ring quest, great faction fixer. (I
trashed mine recently.)

No silk drops, of course, but hoping for Arena next time.
