I also love the bazaar now. I do think that the value of many items
may decrease, but for the most part it will be for the best. Let's get
some decent gear into the hands of those who really need it while at
the same time allowing the seller to make some plat. It also squelches
the scammers who try to sell gear for way more than it's worth.

I'm all for making a buck or being rewarded for killing the mob for
that uber item, but this will help keep us honest.  Besides, maybe
I'll be able to afford those SCHW now. :)
