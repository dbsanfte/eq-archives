I would like to join that club (on Test Server) but I don't have
a Vale Sewing Kit. Pieces of high quality ore are needed to smith
said sewing kit. I can't find them anywhere though! The usual 
sources say they drop from goblins in Runnyeye or Permafrost.
Well, if they do, they must be DAMN rare. All I get is bricks
of ore, never pieces.

Or maybe there is a way to break bricks into pieces? I have looked
for such a recipe and haven't found any.

BTW, there are others doing halfling cultural on Test. I still
have the imbued studded arms that a kind tailor dropped on me 
when I was level 1.
