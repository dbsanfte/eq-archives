Shaman also aren't as plentiful, so you'll find you have less "this spot's
taken" then druids deal with.

Also, don't forget that Iksar, ogres, and trolls can be shamen.  Personally,
I can't stand either of the butt-scratching races, and I'm not fond of Iksar
either, however, they are something to be considered.
