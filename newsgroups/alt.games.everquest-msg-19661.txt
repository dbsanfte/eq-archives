As a cleric, when I have an enchanter in the group, I'm typically pretty
good on mana.  I'll root all mezzes before the tanks break it.  I gives a
little hate to me rather then enchanter (I'm a bit better protected), and it
gives the tanks, hopefully, a few rounds to build agro before the root
breaks and its free to hit who it wants.
