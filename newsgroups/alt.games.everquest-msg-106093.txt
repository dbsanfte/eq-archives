Ignore those "Guides"... they're a rip-off. Full of half-truths, bannable
exploits, outright lies and blindingly obvious public knowledge. Most aren't
even researched, just copied off various websites like EQTraders,
Allakhazams and EQ.Castersrealm.

The ONLY way to surefire riches in EQ is by doing it the hard way... find a
bunch of people to group with regularly, level up, and hit the high-end game
to "pH4rm the ph4t l33wtZ"


There ARE a few ways to make money with a minimum of risk at a relatively
low level, and regular readers of this newsgroup will recognise most (if not
ALL) of the following... save your $20 and read on...

For any level character... but only because tradeskills aren't capped with
level...

Fish Fillets (makes about 10plat/hour with Baking skill 50+)... buy 1 fish
fillet and 1 jug of (total cost 7-8sp), combine to make 2 Fish Fillets
(selling price 11-14sp)... BORING

Ceramic Vaned Arrows (makes about 20plat/hour with Fletching skill 175+)
Combine wood arrow shaft, field point, large knock and CERAMIC VANE (in
place of fletch)... you need to spend around 1-2kpp to get that kind of
skill... BORING

Jewelcrafting... enchanting the metal before using it will get you a
finished item worth 2-100 SILVER worth more than cost... VERY BORING, and
you need to be EXTREMLY lucky on your failure rate (so no guarantees on
profits)


Hunting strategies...

Karanas Bandit Sashes... sashes are NO DROP (and only drop of the humans),
so you'll have to carry them yourself... remember to loot the bronze weapons
as well... a solo melee character of about 19 and higher, can make about
20-30 plat per hour by collecting these sashes and handing them in at the
ThunderKnights in South Qeynos. (long walk if you can't get druid ports
between NK and Surefall)

Everfrost Mammoths (not calves) are good loot, but the tusks are heavy and
do not stack

Deathfist Orcs are dropping (very rarely) a chain helm worth about 22-26plat
to a vendor.

South Karana Aviaks (from early-mid 20s) drop low level gems (best is Ivory,
worth 12-16pp), 1-2plat, and Bronze weapons... but you need to hunt Darters
and above... and Avocets (hitting for upto 70 a pop) will join in and kill
you fast. If you get lucky on the drops, you can make nice cash selling to
Krak Windchaser (the Aviak vendor at the top of the Treehouse).

South Karana Tesch Mas Gnolls (Splitpaw Spires) dropping FS weapons and
1-4pp... often fully camped, and you need to be slightly higher than for
Aviaks (late 20s to early 30s)

Rathe Mountains Hill Giants... CAN drop upto 40plat each... but ACTUALLY
average only 15-20pp (and you will get some than only drop gold... had one
drop only 107 silver, 190 copper). Again, these are usually fully camped,
and you need to be grouped from early 30s... some casters can solo from mid
30s.
