Yeah.  People are stupid.  It sucks.  There oughta be a law or
something, heh.  Actually, lots of players have been obnoxious
about mana regen since long before KEI entered the game.  The
Enchanter I played long enough to get Breeze was once invited to
come join a group in an area I thought would be a bit too tough,
but I stupidly went anyway.  It became obvious on the first pull
after I joined that I was useless for anything except buffs, and
since the group's casters and hybrids all had their Breeze by then
I was immediately on the receiving end of an assortment of "gee I
guess this is too high for you" comments.  It took me a minute to
leave the group though, I'm a slow typer and /ignore won't take 5
names on a single line.
