Oh, by the way, nice "trap" attempt. You give me two choices here:
Stop replying and look like I'm admitting defeat after you've taken
such absurd shots at me or keep replying and look like I'm fighting
for the last word.

It was a pathetic attempt on your part to try to push me into giving
you the last word. Really, not everyone in this world is as gullible
as you.
