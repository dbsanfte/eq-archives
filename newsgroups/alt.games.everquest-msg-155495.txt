I agree completely I HATE being dependent on grouping and hope they never
change this.  My favorite way to play is partnering up with one or two
friends and going to places less travelled.  There are already numerous
zones that are under-utilized because you really need a group to effectively
hunt them, but it requires bring your own group to the zone to do this.
It's really hard to get 6 people together long enough to get to these zones
with time left to do anything worthwhile.

One night I spent two hours just trying to get a group going in SolA with my
necro alt and a friend.  First the chanter had to leave to go eat dinner,
then the cleric had to go take care of her son, then the chanter got back
and promptly fell in the lava, then two druids who joined got scared of the
zone and left (no I am not kidding) Then the Paladin got stuck under the
stairs.  By the time the cleric got back the Chanter had to leave for the
night.  I think we also had one death and two LD's somewhere in the mix,
making it one of the most frustrating EQ nights ever.  I really wished that
my friend and I could have handled this zone alone, but we really couldn't
at that level.
