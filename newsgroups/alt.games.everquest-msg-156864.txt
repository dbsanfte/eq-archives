Yellow:  the spell can only be cast upon yourself.  It doesn't matter 
what you target.

Red:  the spell will affect only the one mob/player you target.

Green: the spell will affect the mob/player you're targeting, plus all 
appropriate mobs/players within a certain range of it.  (Actually, most 
spells like this will only affect the mob you're targeting plus three 
others, maximum, no matter how many are within the radius.)

Blue: the spell will affect all appropriate mobs/players within a 
certain range of yourself, plus yourself as well if it's beneficial.

Purple:  the spell will affect all party members within its range, 
including yourself.
