Ahh .. Avenger doth speak .  Though crafty thy first thrust may be ,  I fear
tis astray from  mark . Mine lands have grown sparse for bush of mint ,
mutton shall we eat this niht .  Does not thy left hand no not what thy
right has done ?  . Does not both cherish thy staff ?  Thine is but a charge
to one that has no virtue  , but alas thy flame is cast .  It is all but
over , thy knees grow weary .  I intuit thy next recourse . Send thy minions
to flegil about to bereft me of my charge .  Though a thought doth come to
mind , that troubles me all to well . Why hath thee come , for all can see
what follis lays within .
