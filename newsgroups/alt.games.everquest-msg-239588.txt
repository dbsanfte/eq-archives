One thing you can do is open your inventory and drag an inventory slot or
two, plus your primary and secondary hand slots to your hotbutton bar. This
will allow you to pick up and switch your instruments with items in your
inventory. This does not worth with inventory slots inside containers though
I am afraid to the best of my knowledge. I'm not aware of any macro way of
doing this though.

Hope that helps!
