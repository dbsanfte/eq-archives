    Unless you have specific hunting grounds in mind where stuff will be
green to you and blue to him, there's no reason to do this. Many places,
stuff is blue/light blue all the way to 60. So consider letting normal XP go
up again.

    Options for a cleric:

1) WIS. Lets you swap out some of the flimsy WIS gear you might otherwise be
wearing and get gear with HPs/AC/resists. Especially resists - if and when
you start raiding, you'll find most resist gear makes you lose WIS.
2) STA. HPs are HPs, and even though each point in STA will only get you six
HPs (at level 60), it's better than Metabolism. You are highly unlikely to
get STA to 200 anytime soon, too.
3) Regen. It actually helps later in life, when you use mod rods and take
damage from AoEs a lot. Again, though, that's later in life.
4) Any stat below 75. As a dwarf, I have base AGI 70 - that's a 40 point hit
to AC unless my AGI gets to 75. Having it be above 75 without gear would be
good, as that gives me more freedom with equipment. Right now I have a
collar I can't wear because my AGI would drop below 75 if I put it on. :-(

    That's about it. I'd suggest avoiding Metabolism (you summon food), the
holding your breath one (increased STA helps you hold your breath anyways),
or any of the resist ones (2 points in a resist just doesn't get noticed).

> Oh, also, the pally wouldn't mind advice on what to do with hers :)

    Were I a paladin I'd be looking (after Run Three) at STA, regen, WIS in
that order.
