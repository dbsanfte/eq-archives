There's a big difference between actually being coward, and doing a cowardly
thing. For instance, you can be an intelligent person, but do a horribly
stupid thing. Does that make the normally intelligent person an idiot? No,
it only means they have a tendency to do stupid things. The same thing can
be said for bravery and cowardice. Sometimes the sky is pink... does that
mean it's always pink?

It's cowardly because of instead of facing your problem you hide from it.
It's like hiding under your bed from the boogy-man... you can't get hurt
from it, yet you avoid it.
