Yes It is now recommended level of 35 (less than that and it is less
effective, basically lowering the damage and by the sound of it, AC as well)
I'd be surprised that it would proc at 35, seems a little low.
Pity Verant can't adjust some old world equipment in the opposite direction,
Yaks to proc at 30, Dark Reavers at 20th etc....Just a thought :ï¿½)
