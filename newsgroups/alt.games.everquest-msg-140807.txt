OMG, see why couldn't I think of something like that to say when I was in
basic training for the Air Force.  I used to think up things I would do if I
WANTED to get in trouble, like waking through the cafeteria, spying a TI
(training instructor, Air Force kindler gentler version of a drill
instructor) in my way and saying, "Would you get the hell out of my way I'm
trying to get to the table."  But what your friend did, that is just
classic.
