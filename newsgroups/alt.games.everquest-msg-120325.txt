That sucks.   We didn't realise it was a bug (thought it was changed in-line
with the port stone price changes etc)

As a result of the non-poofing key, my guild (who haven't been to PoA on a
raid for at least a year and half) spent 2 days inside PoA last week or the
week before, including clearing the entire zone (we killed noble djarn etc,
so the eye of veeshan was up to be killed too)

With that change, i forsee another 2 years before we raid the place again...

Nice of verant to nerf an already way under-used zone....
