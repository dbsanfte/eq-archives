  Also, you can adjust the chat box window size and text size.  That's the
only element of the UI that you really need to be able to CLEARLY see
anyway, except maybe the HP bars.  I personally have little difficulty
clearly seeing the HP bars at 1024x768 resolution on a 17" CRT monitor.

  The fact that the UI elements take up less space, I see as a good thing,
because it allows you to see more of the game.  Also, on my old system, I
would find that I'd actually be better off performance-wise if I were at
800x600 than at 640x480, because I found that when I was inventory mode at
least, the transparent inventory screen was less demanding on my system than
the old windowed screen that forces you to see a little representation of
your character... which forces your system to not only render your
character, but apparently a lot of the stuff BEHIND your character, which
for me simply KILLED performance on my old system.

  As for why Verant can't program transparent inventory screens and the like
at 640x480, they COULD, but EQ UI has never exactly been what you'd call
"modern".  Right now they're working on a complete overhaul of the UI, but
it's not going to be out for a while yet.  However, from the sound of it,
when the updates are completely, they will have finally brought hte EQ
interface into the 21st century.
