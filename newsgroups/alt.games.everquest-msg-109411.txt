I have three identicle looking banks, with

Divine Light                               Sit/Stand
Celestial Healing                        Remedy
Complete Heal                           (button for MA target, with his name on
it)
(chanter button)                          Assist
Thurg Legs                                 Donals Arms

Each of the heals there announce to a different channel depending on
which bank; group, chat 1, auction

The auction channel because one guild I raid with puts all heals on auction
in a raid

I'll soon be adding a fourth identicle bank, announcements to chat 2, as
my guild is going to try a heals only channel.

Then I have banks set up for soloing, buffing, rez-ing, inventory spaces for
easy
trade skill access...

I normally operate in the "main" consol view, as it cuts lag and (for me) makes
everything a lot more visible, except for those rare occaisions when I need to
pilot carefully, like getting up to Village in Velks.

I sure wish I could get rid of the dorky "this is your class" icon on the left
and
replace it with the new "hits" box use that space to make the 4 missing hotkeys
visible... but what I really dread is them getting rid of that interface
completely.
