I'm with James on this one.  If zone lines hadn't been originally intended
to remove aggro (among other things -- you dishonestly tried to put
words into his mouth about that being their *only* reason for
existence), the developers would have implemented some other way
for players to lose aggro when running for their lives, instead
of forcing them to inevitably being chased down to the ends of
the Earth and killed by bad each and every bad pull (or training 
others in a "help save me" attempt).

Evidence for your perusal:  Kunark.

Zones pre-Kunark were relatively small, and a zone line was never
extremely far away.  But with the new routinely massive zone sizes
of the Kunark release, the developers realized that being miles
from a zoneline with no way to lose aggro was going to be a
real pain in the ass for players.  So what did they do?  They
instituted a *new* method of losing aggro -- if you get far enough
away from a mob, it loses interest in you.

Clearly, the developers didn't just "put up with" people losing
aggro at zone lines out of programming limitations, they
understood that there *have* to be ways for players to run
screaming from trains or bad pulls and have some chance to
shake off their pursuers.  The alternative would have been
"every train is almost inevitably fatal", which even the
densest developer would have to realize would *suck* as
a gaming experience.

Finally, had the developers not wanted zones to be used
as "de-aggroers", it would have been trivial for them to
have mobs retain people on their aggro list whether the
person had zoned or not, so that when the person returned
onto the monster's "turf" (i.e., zoned back in), the monster
would go screaming back after them again.  Clearly, they
chose from the start not to use this method.

Zoning was, indeed, intended to clear aggro and give
players a "fresh start" after a train or bad pull.
