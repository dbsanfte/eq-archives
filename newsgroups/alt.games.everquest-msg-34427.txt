You just witnessed an early part of both of the ranger and druid Epic 
quests.  The spawn is triggered, so you should only see him in EK if 
there are a bunch of level 50ish or higher players around.  The ranger 
or druid who triggered the spawn of the dark elf corrupter and his 
reaver buddies needs a book off of the dark elf corrupter to move 
forward in the quest.  Since the corrupter has this nasty habit of 
despawning rather quickly, the raid party is usually camped on his 
spawn point-- to kill him as quickly as possible-- while the 
person triggering the quest is on the other side of the zone doing 
the hand-in.
