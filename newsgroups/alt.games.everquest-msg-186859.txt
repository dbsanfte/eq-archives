This emp kill was our 2nd. First was a wipe wipe Emp at 40% due to a
positioning technique. the 2nd we got him a whole 1% down due to the weapon
shield ranger messing things up, people sitting down in CC area and Emp jsut
rolled over CC and let loose the 8 CC mobs. Mental.

First kill took us 29 minutes in total. There we 53 of us. We had extra CC
and small kill force and could not position Emp so rogues could backstab.

This time took 16 mins. Same lvl of CC but our Wizard team finally got out
of bed so we killed him in 16 minutes. Same problem tho with rogue team, we
can't position emp to get clear shot at his back.

Any tips from a passmaster would be appreciated.
