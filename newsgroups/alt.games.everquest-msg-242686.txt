I ran into a badly timed hole in the world - when running from Quey Hills to
Surefall (now understand the name) if running and turn too sharp at first
bend inside tunnel to zone point, instead of bouncing off corner of the wall
you go through, to where there is no ground.

You fall.

and fall...

and fall...

Happened before.  Had to camp (while falling) log out then back in.  Cannot
get back in now.

Sigh.

Wonder if I am still falling?
