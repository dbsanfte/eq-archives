: Get it all the time asking for SoW, Wolf Form, Teleport etc etc. Power

The irritating thing for me is that people never /tell me. I have a 53 shaman,
quite capable of SoW (or regen or haste or HP buffs .. whatever), yet
nobody ever asks for any of that. Whenever I stand somewhere popular (EC
tunnel coms to mind), when a druid is near, people ask him/her for SoW, never
me. I love that, but it's strange. Lowlevel people have in general zero
knowledge of the shaman class it seems. SoW = Druid is kind of hammered
into their minds, even if a shaman gets it 5 levels earlier :)
