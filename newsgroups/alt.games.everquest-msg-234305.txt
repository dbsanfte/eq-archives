THis news is possibly the only good thing to come from my ill planned 
excursion to play SWG for nine months. I had to massively upgrade my 
machine, inluding DirectX 9.1 and a bigger video card with 128 MB of 
onboard RAM.

I logged into the beta of GoD just to make sure it would run, and while 
that will probably change for release, it looked fine there.
