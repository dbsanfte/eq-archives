I have to agree with most everyone- the best is the one you want to play
the most.

My favorite is my barbarian shaman. Or is it my dwarf cleric? No, it's
my wood-elf Warrior. I know! It's the Erudite cleric to Cazic-Thule!

Er... Play a lot of people. Be whoever you want to be. If you are having
fun, it's worth the $10/month, and to heck with anyone else.

-Tirra/Tiru/Tir/Tirea... etc.
