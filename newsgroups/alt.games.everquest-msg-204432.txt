    It allows players to skip content. Skipping content in a linear
progression game is never good.

    It makes entire sections of the world obsolete. Why go to <insert item
camp here> when you can get <insert better item here> by killing any mob
that drops cash loot? So not only do the game designers have to keep
designing content for the top-end players, they also have to keep designing
meaningful content for mid-level players. Because new players won't get
"hooked" on a game where they kill mindless hordes of XP mobs, then buy gear
in The Bazaar. They get hooked when that item they really wanted finally
drops, and rewards them for all the time they invested. It's much more
addictive.
