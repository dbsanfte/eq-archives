I suppose it depends on what race you are.  I know that the stats on the
Enchanted Tier'Dal chainmail looked pretty good to me as a Magician. 
Almost all pieces add between 1 and 4 INT, and a nice bonus to save vs
Magic.  And they weigh almost nothing.  And if you don't like the chain
look, you can still wear a robe over it, since there are robes around that
give similar AC and more Int.  For me, the hard part is finding the blasted
Elf Blood.  I've actually got enough faction with most of the "good" elves
that they don't kill my Dark Elf magician on sight, and I'd rather not
wreck that if I don't have to.  Unfortunately, no one else camps the
Sisters anymore on my server, so I'm stuck getting two vials per day from
the Wood Elf bandits in Greater Shoutdork.  Apparently Dark Elves have no
blood, because I've emptied the top floor of Najena several times without
seeing it.  (Mayong Mistmoore must have it all already.)
