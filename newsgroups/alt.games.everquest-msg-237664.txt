Hello all.  

My main is a level 54 necromancer and I have spent a lot of time
soloing with her, but I group regularly and think I am reasonably good
in a group.  However, over the weekend I was in a LDoN group and was
questioned by the group leader about my grouping skills.

Here is the situation.  The group consisted of a 51 Druid, 51 mage, 48
ranger and 54 druid (me).   The ranger was acting as tank assisted by
the mage's and my pet.  Giving the structure of the group I was doing
ghetto CC.  At one point we pulled and got two adds.  I proceeded to
mez the adds and (of course) agro'd one of them.  I started to kite it
around as I attempted to re-mez it.  In the confusion I didn't notice
that the ranger had left the mob the pets were on and was attempting
to assist me and by agroing the mob off me.

We successfully killed all three mobs, but the group leader commented
that next time I needed to stand still when I get agro to allow the
tank to get the mob off of me.  The ranger later asked me if I group
much.  As a necro, I have many times agro-kited adds and I thought it
was considered a vaild method of CC.

So, what I'd like is peoples opinions as to whether I was being a
total noob.  Personally, I expected the ranger to stick with the
primary mob until it was dead before coming to deal with one of the
adds.  Never during the fight, did I come close to death, so it wasn't
urgent that the add I was kiting be dealt with.

Thanks in advance,

Jeff
