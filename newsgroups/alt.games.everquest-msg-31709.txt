Facts plz^^ Profits controlled it until SoV came out, then they left for
phat lewt over in icicle-land. Then Defiant moved in and farmed fungal
tunics non-stop for six months, then *they* left, too. Finally, Xanit
K'ven decided to crawl in there now that their enemies had left.

Right until the zone crashes.
Or the losers decide to bind-rush you instead of looting and scooting.
Or a Guide warns you for 'zone disruption'

And then their friends immortal heal against you, so you have to run or
die.

'lighties'
Ah, so you're a darkie.
KOS.
Or something.

Not anymore.
Profits are dying on their feet, and most of the more 'uber' of them
have either quit or been banned for exploiting.
And the 'light team' is all based on crossteaming anyway, so no need to
define Profits as 'lights and darks'.

IF by uber you mean 'annoy the rest of the dark team so much that they
caused a decent dark team only guild to go 4-team crossteamer' then -
yes, you're correct.

Crossteamers fighting crossteamers. Whee!




Wow, that was bitter. I think I'll go back to posting on FlameVault.
