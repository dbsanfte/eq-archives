Imagine for a moment EQ1 is profitable and the average profit per EQ1
employee is $50/hour.

Now imagine that the bean counters at SOE do some revenue modeling and
determine that if the EQ1 resources were working on EQ2 related stuff
instead, the average profit per EQ1-turned-EQ2 employee would be
$100/hour.

Voila.  SOE pulls the plug on EQ1, even though it's still profitable.

I would need some pretty good proof that EQ1's costs are pretty much
negligible before I'd accept this as a fact.

I guess what SOE does in these areas remains to be seen.
