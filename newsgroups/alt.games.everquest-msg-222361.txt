You've observed that the earth pet roots.  What you haven't
thought thru is what this can mean.  Mob position is important to
melee in general, if you are behind the mob then you do more
damage because it can't parry or riposte or block or dodge your
blows, all of these will reduce the damage you do plus the
riposte part actually hurts.  This isn't unique to mobs, either,
if a mob is hitting -you- you should try to arrange to have it in
front of you so you get more defenses.

On average, once you get up in levels a bit, you'll find that
there's about a 15% boost to damage output for being behind a
mob.  For a rogue, though, due to backstab skill working only if
you are, well, in back of the mob, the difference is about 40%.

Root stops a mob from moving, but it does something else funny,
it causes the mob to attack whichever PC is closest to it, rather
than whichever it hates the most.  This can be difficult for some
people to cope with, although it seems simple enough for the
rogue to back up a bit, have the warrior (or SK or pally) move in
real close and keep aggro that way.  Thing is, earth pet root is
weak, short duration, and therefore unpredictable; is the mob
going to be using Hate aggro or Prox aggro?

Further, if the mob turns to run, thats free hits on the back, if
its snared it will just stand there and let you beat on it...
unless its rooted, in which case it will turn on you as if it
wasn't hurt at all!

For most groups, earth is the last pet you want to use.

Air pets do have invis, for which I can't think of any use
outside a PvP environment these days (it was once fantastic, till
they changed aggro rules so nothing will attack a pet that isn't
attacking something) but more to the point they have Stun, which
can cause mobs to stand still and do nothing for a few seconds,
and can interrupt casting.  This makes the air pet a favorite in
groups... although the stun, being unpredictable and interfering
with facing can be annoying.  So sometimes people go with the
water pet, who does direct damage with his spell instead of
something fancy, nice and simple and clean.  The fire pet's DS
rarely comes into play in a group, since he isn't likely to get
hit... I just mention him for completion.
