DM: As you approach the tavern a male Half Elf is making great strides to
reach you, he's clothed in mainly leather and is wearing a short sword on
his. He stops and stands immediately infront of you.

Player: I stop, what is he doing?

DM: He appears to be examining everything you have, he hasn't touched you or
your equipment but is definitely interested in what you are wearing and what
you are carrying.

Player1 to Player2 "Think we just found the town 'tard"

Player1: What is he doing now

DM: He's looking pleased with himself as if he has found what he looking
for, he speaks "Sow plz"

Player2 to Player1 "Yup"
