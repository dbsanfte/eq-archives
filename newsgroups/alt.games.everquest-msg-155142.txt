Hardly a reason to care less about Australians
even if it were true.

To ignore a warning, you would have to know one
existed. You make it sound as if they deliberately
thumbed their nose at officials who were pleading
with them not to go.

Where exactly is this warning? Do you have a URL?

If the tourists weren't there, they wouldn't even
get a measly living.

There will be major funds set up for the
Australian victims, as well.

Yes, they are. I agree, it sucks.

Understandable that they would concentrate their
reportage on the Australian victims...
understandable, though not acceptable.
