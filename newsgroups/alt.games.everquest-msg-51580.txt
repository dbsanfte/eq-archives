RAID 0 (plain striping) does perform pretty well, just be aware that
your redundancy will be *reduced* by using this.  I.e. if one of the
two disks fail, you'll lose the whole file system.

Choosing a RAID strategy is usually tradeoff between 3 variable: cost,
performance & reliabilty.  You can subdivide performance into read &
write performance - EQ will be much more read-intensive.

The options:

RAID 0 (plain striping)
  cost - cheap
  performance - good
  reliability - poor

RAID 1 (mirroring)
  cost - not so cheap
  performance - good (writing not so good)
  reliability - good

RAID 0+1 (striping & mirroring)
  cost - expensive (need at least 4 disks for 2 disks' worth of storage)
  performance - good (writing not so good)
  reliability - good

(You'd need 0+1 if you want a large disk array, simple RAID 1 will only
mirror a single disk)

RAID 5 (distributed parity)
  cost - fairly good (but need at least 3 disks)
  performance - read: ok, write: poor
  reliability - good

For most simple home setups, I'd expect read performance to much more
of a priority than write performance.  Therefore RAID 5 is probably the
most cost-effective option if you're concerned about data integrity.
On the other hand, if you make backups, RAID 0 is fine as long you're
prepared for the need to do a full rebuild if one disk fails.
