remember when:

- you couldn't swap spells in the spell book
- hill giants spawns in east commons
- you couldn't use hotkeys while medding
- you had to click "meditate" to med
- you had to look at spell book to med (everyone does hah)
- low end snakes and spiders were aggro and trained like crazy
- you only had 20 social commands
- you only had 36 hot keys
- friends list was same for all chars on all servers
- Mayong Mistmoor would wipeout zone every 12 hours or whatever
- root and snare didn't stack
- root canceled sow
- jboots would work in dungeons
- jboots DROPPED in najena and were sold on ebay regularly
- you didn't get a message when spell wore off
- Every single froggie in Guk was decalred to be part of a "camp"
- you didn't get a message saying what was looted when in group
- we would do alpha loot to 5 plat or fine steel
- mask of deciever (illusion dark elf) was all/all and dropped
- pets would proc sword of runes on anything

The game has definatly gone thru a lot of changes. Lot of these are
from beta.
