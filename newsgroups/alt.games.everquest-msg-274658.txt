Each of the continents is connected by a "Boat" you ring the Mariner's Bell
on the dock and you arrive at your destination.  From Antonica, head into
the Thundering Steppes.  Follow the road and take the first branch to the
left (you should veer South).  Follow this into the "Dead River Bed" (or
something similar) and turn left again.  This will take you to the docks
where you can ring the bell and get to the Nektulos dock.  If you do not
have any sort of night vision, I suggest you not make the run at night as
Nektulos is deathly dark.  Once in Nektulos, carefully head north (there are
aggressive beasts on the beach area) and find the "Hidden Beach Path".
Follow it north, at the fork, bear right, roughly west.  There are
aggressive Owlbears and screeching things along the path, so be ready to
sprint.  Stay on the road until you reach the river, I found nothing deadly
in the river and simply swam south until I could no more.  Here, at the edge
of the river is the entrance to Commonlands.

I suggest that you have maps readily available, I use those found at The
Tower of Dreams: http://www.gry-online.pl/eq2/index.asp

The run through Nektulos reminds me of the ancient days of Norrath when
Kithicor Forest was a deadly place to the unwary, and more so at night.

I recently made this run for this very quest.  I suggest that you explore
the Commonlands before you make the run.  Knowing where you need to go is
very important for the quest.

I hope that helps.
