I have one female char...Dark Elf Necro name Pewtriid.  Only time she's
had anything like this happen was about lvl 3 (day after I created the
char). Some ugly, smelly gross ogre, or troll, or iksar, or maybe it was
a half-elf  kept LITERALLY following me asking if I needed help.  Saying
things like "Cute name" and other assorted things I promptly forgot or
ignored.  I sent a /tell to a pally friend of mine to come check the guy
out.  I mean, he was using /say...not even private tells. 

Me and the pally sat down and "listened" to the guy for 5 or 10 minutes
before my friend sent him a /tell saying "You do know Pewtriid is a guy.
right?"  Dude ran away as fast as his little legs could carry him. 

I thought it was funny, in a pathetic, distorted way.  OTOH, I tend to
try to be polite to both male and female chars, and don't give a
tinkerer's damn what they look like...it's only a game.  (I have run
across people that ARE as rude and crude as this thread has shown.) 

Anyway, that's my tale of female characterdom.
