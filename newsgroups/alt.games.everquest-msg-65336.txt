Which will help greatly on those occasions where, say you are 13th level and
you are standing around Bandl with your friends and you try to buff one of
your buddies and accidentally target Bandl and then, instead of a buff you
accidentally hit an attack spell on top of it.

Or those times where you run to the Guards to kill whatever is on you, they
do you wait a few min and then decide to step out of tower and hit your
track button.  You of course have a guard targeted for whatever reason and
your track button is right next to your range attack button and well...

Or, when you are in the Gypsy camp in NK and a griffawn comes down and
starts hacking on you and for some reason you are trying to do something and
end up accidentally (in a state of panic of course) targeting one of the
gypsies instead of the griff...

NOT that I have personal experience with any of this mind you...  I've just
been TOLD that this stuff has happened....

LMAO!  Yeah, right I have...
