My best guess would be no, keep the hardware modem.  The problems you are
seeing as far as slow fps, are likely caused by the low end system you have,
and how long it takes it to update the display, not by communication lag.
The last thing you want to do is put more load on the system you have,
thereby reducing even more it's ability to update the display.  I used to
play just fine with a 24k connection, pre SOL, I did not try post SOL.

As far as the communication speed, you are likely looking at the speed at
which you are communicating to the modem, which I am guessing is an external
modem hooked up to a com port.  You always want that speed set higher than
the maximum modem connect speed, as the modem will do hardware
compression/decompression of the data, thereby, yielding a higher throughput
than the 33600.  This compression/decompression is particularly effective
with nonbinary data, such as text files.
