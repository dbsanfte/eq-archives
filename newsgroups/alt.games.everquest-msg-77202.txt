    Between you and Thurg is a stretch of land that has wandering Young
Shardwurms (major undercons, could be trouble, but usually easily seen and
avoided), Tizmaks (indifferent unless you've hunted them), Coldain wolves
and wolfmasters (apprehensive unless you've hunted them), and the odd Tundra
Kodiak (you should be able to kill these without issue). There's one hilly
area where you might get jumped, but in general you can see things from a
mile away and just run around them.

    That's just a river-stream, barely deep enough for a dwarf to submerge
themselves.
