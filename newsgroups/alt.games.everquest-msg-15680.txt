Never lead a guild before have you?
There's a point when a guild begins to collapse in itself just from
sheer size alone.  The piss poor interface that EQ provides limits
this "critical" mass to around 50 to 70 members at most (plus or minus
a few depending on how organized the "core" group of officers and
leads are).

But generally when you "relax" rules like that, what happens is
everyone and their friend wants person XYZ "because he's a really
great person and blah blah blah".  In reality, what happens is once
you start adding folks who are WAY too low level to participate in the
major raids, you end up with a tier of people within the guild:
Basically the have and have nots.  

To say this blows a HUGE fucking hole in morale would be an
understatement.

This doesn't even consider the stupid headaches the officers/lead has
to deal with when personalities clash--and they will clash.  The more
people you add, the more often they clash.  It's simple human nature.
