Personally I would go with the game iself if it is indeed only $10.00
now-a-days.  I dont doubt Lokari or Dan on the price.. just matters if you
can find a place to sell it for that price depending on your area.  That
goes without saying though.

The magazine confines you to a server made just for this "demo" purpose.
You have full game play, Kunark and Antonica, but no Scars of Velious.  The
box set is only the old world though and not Kunark at last check.. sooo..
its a give and take I suppose.

Though, personally, I would rather go with the box set to really see what
the game and the people are all about, therefore you would have to go with
the box set.  I might add this free server they setup for this purpose is
laggggy at times.  Not quite sure why they didnt allow people access to the
"regular" servers, but... <shrug>  The magazine ran me $9.95.
