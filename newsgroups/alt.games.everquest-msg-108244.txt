It's ok, it's not intuitive.

As a matter of fact, though, this is the whole reason for a CH rotation.
When somebody is CH'd, they don't top off their hps and then start
losing them again.  When somebody like Greig hits you for 475 a pop
among other damage, you are actually only going to drive those hps
up to around 4000/6000.  That's why the next cleric has already started
another CH spell, because those extra 3-4k hps you  effectively gave
the MT aren't really going to last that long.
