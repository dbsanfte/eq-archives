Well that is pretty much all I do with my druid anymore.  After I reached
level 49 and realizing that I was a secondary need on raids and such, I am a
port whore.  I willingly port to any zone that someone needs to go to for a
price.  Clerics able to rez get ported for free always.  You never know when
you might need a rez.  Sows and binds will always be done for free.  But
porting for plat is what my druid is used for now.
