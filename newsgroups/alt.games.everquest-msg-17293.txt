Actually, I believe the name is Scoobywan. He's been around and annoying
people for at least a year and a half.

Sorry to hear about your incident, Lokari, and thanks for sharing the
info on the deadbeat.

Why is it that Prexus is only known for its low-life players? First it
was Shekkie and friends from EQIdiots... (I used to run into Shekkie
trying to rip people off all the time). Damn, I could list the other
100+ major jerks I've crossed paths with, but we'd be here all day.
