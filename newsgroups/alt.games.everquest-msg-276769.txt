Heh.  Your point is well taken...but still, I do not consider my system to be leading-edge
in March 2005.  Powerful, yes.  Leading-edge?  No.

I'm at 800MHz FSB; 1.066GHz FSB systems are available for not all that much more than you
would pay for an 800MHz FSB system.  My memory is DDR2 400; DDR2 533 is again the
leading-edge.  I have a 3.0GHz HT Northwood; you can get a 3.0GHz HT Prescott if you want
to cough up the bucks (and cool the thing with a Trane central a/c coil).  I have 8x AGP
Pro; PCI-E x16 is available even on $500 Dell workstations.

I won't contrast my system against those with AMD CPUs, because I'm not very knowledgeable
about such things.  But I believe I am correct in saying that there are readily-available
AMD systems out there that can whoop my system's arse like Gorenaire on a naked monk
making a corpse run to Karnor's Castle.

I suppose that what I was trying to say, was that the OP could probably run 2 instances of
EQ on a mid-range system.  Shame that I started bragging and forgot to make my point. :->
