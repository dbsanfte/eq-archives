VSR is trivial by comparison.

I know, I've seen that too.  I can levitate across with now speed 
enhancement at all, yet, a friend I brought to help me with my epic 1.5 
drop could not get across regardless of what movement speed enhancement 
they had going, and they were just following me.

I remember having these kinds of problems a long time ago, but they upped 
the drop rates.  Even back then, usually we could find a few more mobs in 
some dead end that we missed on the way throught the dungeon.
