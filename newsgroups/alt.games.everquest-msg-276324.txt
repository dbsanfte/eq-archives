The thing is, despite the horrendous lag, I actually liked the
atmosphere of the old bazaar.  It felt *alive*.  It gave you that
sense of being in a crazy marketplace.  It's also what I liked about
the EC tunnel when it was used as the de facto bazaar.  Haggling,
yelling, lots and lots of people.  Just like I see in movies when two
westerners walk down a street in the middle east.

Hide Traders is so video game artificial, it destroys immersion.  One
of the best things EQ has going for it is the atmosphere, and the
bazaar (in its various incarnations) nailed it.
