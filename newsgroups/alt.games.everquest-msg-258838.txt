Yup.  Innate Invis to Undead, woot!

I wasn't actually there, so I don't know, but my understanding is that we
tried it with a very underpowered force.  The event seemed dead simple and
easy to me, so I'm not sure what happened unless a heal was missed or
something.

In the days when we were doing AoW, it was considered polite to let Guild A
try AoW until they gave up, at which point Guild B would swoop in.
Surprisingly we never had a disputed AoW kill so I don't know what the GM's
would rule.

We had a very major dispute with our rival uber-guild over this exact point.
Well, sort of.  We killed Blood despite the rival guild's dispelling of our
mezzes, and we petitioned them.  Then we went down and killed the mob that
triggered the AL event, and they went and killed AL, and we petitioned them
on that as well.  When the GM responded, he banished the rival guild from
the zone altogether over the dispelled mezzes.  He never did actually rule
on the AL issue, but we were quite happy with the zone banishment and didn't
pursue the petition any further.

That particular event remained a cause celebre on our flame boards for weeks
afterwards.  Of course that was a while ago; recently we reminisced in
guildchat how many people in either our guild or theirs currently playing
were actually present for the Blood / Arch-Lich confrontation.  We could
count them on our fingers.  Fortunately, both guilds find ways to keep the
emnity alive and well.  =)

Pretty much exactly that, yeah.

We were in the process of doing so.  My understanding is that a cleric bot
was at the zone line, and the only question was how to get the bot safely to
the corpses.  The rival guild saved us that hassle, and we actually were
grateful, but they saved us a few minutes only.

I have no idea what the timer on the event is, so I can't answer the
question of whether we would have rebuffed in time to re-engage and win.

To me, this is a dead simple issue: because it was a scripted event, and the
script was still running.  Even if we were unlikely to finish the script in
time, the other guild had no right to butt into our script.  It was their
obligation to wait for our script to expire, then initiate their own script.

I can't imagine our guild taking over someone else's script without
permission, even after a wipe.  Scripted events are sacrosanct.  At least
they are to my eyes, and, evidently, the eyes of the GMs.

Again, it's because of the script.  Killing trash is not a script.  The
comparative difficulty is irrelevant; it's the fact that an active script is
running that makes it (at the very least) impolite to engage another guild's
raid target.

It wasn't just the fact that they did this; it was that they lorded it over
us, gloating about how easy it was for them to kill and sending us links to
the loot they won.  That part I was there for.  The necro who led the raid
is infamous on our server for training people in BoT and taunting them about
it.

It was, very basically, an issue of respect.  If we can't get them to follow
some very basic courtesies, they'll be running all over us at their whim.
Fortunately because of the scripted nature of this event, we found a way to
very graphically demonstrate the consequences of being impolite and
inconsiderate.

Yes, they probably will in the future hesitate to help us CR after a raid
wipe on a contested target.  But if that's the price we pay in order to get
them to respect some basic courtesies, then so be it.  We're willing to pay
that price.

I had much the same thought.  =)  Perhaps he had a Hammer of the Sun.

Well, given that Marr's Blessing has been rendered mostly irrelevant by the
other GoD focus items I have (neck and arms), having a minor stat upgrade,
longer-lasting buffs, and spell shielding and regular shielding would seem
to make up for the loss of the stun resist and the useless Specialize
Alteration mod.

But I agree it's not a major upgrade and I should perhaps be saving my loot
karma for something nicer, like that ring from Txevu with the same focus
effect as the BP.

No, but we do have to keep up-to-date magelo's so that officers can look
that stuff up if they need to.

I honestly have no idea how it works, but I do know that the tank I was
healing seldom got banished.

My understanding is that it goes this way:  SK gets aggro, wizard casts
strong root, mage earth pets attack, and then warrior goes in and stands on
Noq's toes.  The warrior gets proximity aggro but the SK is the one that
maintains "real" aggro.  Again, no clue on the specifics, as my job is
simply to heal the MT and the backup tank for when the MT gets banished.

Oh, I may be mis-remembering here.  I thought we added people after the
first Noq wipe but maybe I'm confusing that with the people we added after
cursecallers.

> Its a really nice neck, grats =)

Thanks.  =)  I'm pretty happy.

Doesn't help when the only chanter gets one-rounded.  =)

It was a serious attempt, just a gentle probe.  Alas the golems did not
respond so gently.
