I've started a halfling druid and reached level 6 last night. My first
training points I put into1h blunt. I've read elsewhere that I should put a
point into each of the types of magics and into other useful skills like
foraging, swimming, etc. Well, I did that, but I still have a few points
left over. Should I just put the rest into one of the magic types that I
will be using the most or somewhere else? Should I save them or would my
character be better off by spending them all now? I plan on soloing quite a
bit, if that makes any difference. Is there a limited number of skill points
I can have, similar to UO where you could only have a max of 700 points?

I've also noticed that when I go to train, where it used to say 'no charge'
it now has what looks like platinum and gold coins with numbers contained
within. I'm assuming that is how much money it will cost to train that skill
up to the next level and that I can no longer spend training points on that
skill. If that is so, then I guess I would be better off just using the
skill for gains rather than spending what little money I have to improve
them or am I way off?

Also, is there any difference between blunt vs. slash? Can I do both equally
or should I pick one and stick with it? Thanks for your help!
