I'm not sure if this is a bug or me but I have not increase in skill points
for over a level in 1h Blunt. I've been using the Hammer of Wrath as my
primary weapon and my battle technique is to root, furor if not undead (Ward
Undead) and then finish with melee. I'm stuck at 44 skill points in 1H Blunt
and I'm a LVL 11 Cleric.

Another question about skill points;

I put a skill point in Hand to Hand and went out tried to practice this
skill on green coned mobs and could not increase this skill. Do I have to
fight higher level mobs?



Any help is appreciated
