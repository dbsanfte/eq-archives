If you can afford it get an evil eye bag or go quest a rallic pack; weight
reduction bags help FAR more than strength and generally work out cheaper.

Concentrate your weapons and armour on combat ( for which strength is all
but irrelevant ) and weight reduction for encumberance. The only reason to
spend money on +Str gear is if its also an upgrade in another area.

Jagged bands from unrest, for example, are 5ac +3str I think (a while since
I had them), so if thats good AC for your fingers the strength can be seen
as an added bonus.
