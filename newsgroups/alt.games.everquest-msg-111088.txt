Ok I'm not a techie type so I will try to explain this as best I can. We had
problems with constant lock-up and disconnect on one system in the house.
This system had a modem and video card that were built into the motherboard.
It was explained to me that this was a problem because they draw power from
the motherboard instead of having their own power supply.  It was
recommended that we replace these items with independently functioning ones.

Might be something to check into.
