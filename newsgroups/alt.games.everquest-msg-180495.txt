Well on the newbie trolls having a new city, I'd think not, just like
the Coldain city was not a new one for Dwarfs.... all the surrounding
zones are 35 plus... so where would the newbie troll go a hunting.

It has the feel of the Velious add on.  New features only for the
buyers of the add on. (I could be wrong but wasn't the new interface
for velious owners only).

I to agree the voodoo/pirate theme looks rather spooky and cool.
