Ahhh... yeah, that's clearer now...

So you want SoW on the page in your spellbook containing all the spells you
use to solo...
And you want another copy of SoW on the page in your spellbook containing
all the spells you use to powerlevel... etc

Well... as there are only 250 slots in a spellbook... and I think Mages are
already pretty close to filling that (I could be wrong, but I think I read
that mages at level 60 have well over 200 spells they can cast already)...
then dupe spellbook slots are going to make things even worse.

Get familiar with the layout of your spellbook... and get into the habit of
using the '/book page#' command to swap your most used spells... for
example, SoW and Lev are both on page 8 in my Druids' book... been there
since I got them at 14... and various ports are pages 44-50 (right at the
back) except for Gate (page 3).

If all else fails, program a bank of 'socials' with the pages your spells
are on and lable the buttons by spell name... using a different social bank
for each situation

For example...
Social key lable = SoW
macro = /book 8

Hit that button and you sit down with the spellbook open at the page with
SoW on it :o)
