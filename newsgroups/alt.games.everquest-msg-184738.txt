Am using Win2k, 512MB PC2700, GeForce GTS 64MBddr, xp 2100+, blah, blah,

No, it's not a bogus install....I've seen plenty of those.  Just error upon
error upon error...yes, the VIA chipset drivers do seem to be an issue, as I
had stated my work-around was to avoid certain drivers.  Considering this is
the driver set supplied by the mobo manufacturer, then yes, I consider this
to be a hardware problem.  If the software powering the hardware sucks, then
ultimately the hardware sucks (can you say "ati"? LOL!) in my opinion.

I'm glad you didn't have the issues that I did.  Some games ran with a few
"glitches", but EQ just plain wouldn't run.  Sony tech support went
something like this:

Them:"Your soundcard isn't supported"
Me:"It's the first one listed as supported on your site!"
Them:"Disable it."
Me:"F*** you."

Why do I even bother calling *anywhere* for tech support.  Always passing
the buck.  I would assume that most of us that learn about fixing our
systems learn as a result of this, hehe.  Can't depend on vendors, so fix it
yourself!

Don't get me wrong...my system runs smooth now, but given what I've had to
deal with, I personally wouldn't buy another one.
