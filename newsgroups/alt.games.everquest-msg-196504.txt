Highpass hold was built for exactly this purpose, but they never got around
to doing it. Go look at the gambling tables up there. I recall Brad stating
the idea was for in game 'mini-games' there.

Its kind of sad... there are lots of good little features in EQ that
never made it that arent based around killing everything in sight... another
is the noticeboards in pubs and bars that , if better implemented, could have
been a focal point for finding groups, letting friends know whats up, etc,
far better than the 'oh so immersive' LFG tool.
