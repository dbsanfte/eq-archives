And that is my one big, huge, obscene problem with the whole boat system.
I dont have a problem with sitting on a boat going from place to place,
its quite fun and in many situations advantageous...alllows me to med my
mana back up, praccy off a few skills etc etc etc. But why oh why do the
zone lines have to be impossible to cross by swimming etc.

I dont want to be able to bounce anywhere at anytime, otherwise the whole
expanse of the world loses any interest and you might as well just make
one big zone....but I would like to be able to do something if I fall off
a boat (all too easy to do on the FV boat as I found out....at least that
has a prow you can sit on.
