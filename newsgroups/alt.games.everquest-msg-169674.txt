<snip a bunch of stuff>
:
: The message does clearly state you need both your model on and horses on.
When you attempt, as logic
: might suggest, horses off and your model on, you get the message.  And you
get it with horses off and
: your model off both.  No message with both on, but I'd have burned my
bridle the day I bought it if I'd
: had to put up with that horse another minute.  Fortunately, the message
lies, your model off, horses on
: works fine.
:
: Eventually, I'm sure, they'll fix that.  Pity.

So does the horse show up in the buff bar when you do this?  I had bone this
and it gave me the race / horse error.  Every time i clicked the bridle it
pulled up the 3 second casting bar insted of doing a .1 second like when you
are on a horse and you use the bridle as a insta click to refresh your gems.
Mayby I am just going to have to go back and try it some more.


Thanks for the info.
