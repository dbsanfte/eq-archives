You drop a symbol on everybody?  Only on the MT and even then, I will 
say something in a pick-up group.

A great way of handling idiots is to disband and never group with them 
again.

Clerics are much more than that.  It just takes time to play one well 
and get to know the capabilities and limitations of the class.  Yes, you 
spend a lot of time on your butt.  Yes, you can be the bottleneck for 
the group that want to pull constantly.  Your response should always be 
along the lines of, "You can pull, I can't heal you if it goes bad,  
Luckily I have enough mana left to gate if it does, so you won't be able 
to kill me."
