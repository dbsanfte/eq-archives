The easiest way, the way that worked for me, is to do the invis trick
on every hand-in.
You could also do it by raising truespirit faction, you need the help
of an enchanter for it initially. Goes like this:
Kill Pegleg, let enchanter charm the lesser spirit. You can now get
the gem from the spirit. Go to Bondl Felligan, open trade window and
then let someone else invis you and hit trade. Rinse, repeat.

Good luck.
