Yup I hear ya,

Two years 3 accounts 5 or 6 characters in low 50s and 2 over 55. My
pride and joy is my 58 Warrior (Human no less and the oldest toon).
Yes, I have no life. Yes I got bored. The ultimate solution to my
problem was a great guild. I never new they were great until I joined
though sadly, otherwise my EQ experience would have been GREATLY
enhanced mUCh earlier.

The thing that keeps me comming back is my devotion and loyalty to
this great bunch of friends, achieving things that were a pipe dream
to us 3 months ago (like killing Trak) as a group is a great feeling.

Oh, and yes we are a smallish guild, Trak (well any dragon) takes a
full turn out.

If I didnt have these challenges to face, both from an organisation
standpoint and from a social standpoint, there is no way I would still
be playing.

The idea of facing level 1-30 again horrifies me.

In short. Raid like a madman. See the sites you NEVER thought you
COULD see. Like Gorenieare (sp) dieing to your blade, just before
sunset, on a cold winters day in the snow.
