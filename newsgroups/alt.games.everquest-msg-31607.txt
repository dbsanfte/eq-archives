Sorry, but that goes way back, long before Austin Powers. Here's but one
example:


 English Teeth, English Teeth!
 Shining in the sun
 A part of British heritage
 Aye, each and every one.

 English Teeth, Happy Teeth!
 Always having fun
 Champing down on bits of fish
 And sausages half done.

 English Teeth, HEROES' Teeth!
 Here them click! and clack!
 Let's sing a song of praise to them -
 Three Cheers for the Brown Grey and Black.

     -- Spike Milligan, 1959, "Silly Verse for Kids".
