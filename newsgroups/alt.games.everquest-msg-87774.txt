Definately worth a try - even if you can't get him for KSing, because he 
doesn't admit it in tells, *harassment* is an offence too, and multiple 
reports of him deliberately trying to get your back up may get him looked 
at by the GMs. The only problem is you'll have to be extremely restrained 
in your replies to him so he doesn't use the same trick on you.

Other than that, you may have better luck convincing his guild to black-
ball him unless they are comprised of a bunch of equally annoying assholes.
