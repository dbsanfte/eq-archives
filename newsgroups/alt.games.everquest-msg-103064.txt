    I don't have a key, thank Brell. The other clerics get to go farm that
hellhole when the exploratory monk reports something has a one hander - I
can go work XP, tradeskills, twinks, anything while they waste time. If none
of the golems has a one hander on him, we leave the zone alone - the local
newly-reformed former power guild apparently needs every primal they can
get, and will clear it for us. Either that or they still haven't figured out
how to tell if a golem has a one hander.

    And actually farming ST isn't the biggest pain. It's getting a ST key
for every new melee recruit that doesn't have primal. With the Nexus it's
easy to assemble in EW, but going to WW is just as big a pain in the ass as
it ever was.

    Having something like a "ghost of X the Warder", dropping one or two of
those Essence items each, would have been nice. But the larger guilds that
woke the Sleeper in the first place would have been opposed, seeing as how
they don't even like the prismatic scale thing now. "It rewards guilds that
never woke the Sleeper!!!"

    People keep saying those Essence items are OK, but really, what is in
game now that replaces things like the ring and earring? Remember, right now
as far as anyone knows the Ring of Vulak is still broken, so don't count
Vulak drops.

    You forgot to mention how Zland, the easiest one, is popped for his
EC-sellable Heart by any guild big enough to kill him (and there's lots). So
farming him for keys isn't really an option as you're always racing to get
him. The best bet if you want keys is Sont - and all you get from him is the
key (and a few spells).
