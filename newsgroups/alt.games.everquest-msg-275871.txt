   I wasn't around for this, or else I was so comatose that I simply
didn't notice it. But given the fact that most people can killfile
idiots, I can't really see how members of one newsgroup could reasonably
hope to destroy another.  I guess "reasonably" is the key word here. 
The Fight Ace newsgroup crowd don't sound as if they were a real
reasonable bunch.

    Maybe I'll try googling Fight Ace Everquest this weekend and see if
I get any interesting hits.
