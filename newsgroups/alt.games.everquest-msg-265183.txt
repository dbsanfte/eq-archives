For me, though, that's not what's happening. I used to scroll down 
through the posts and check to see if there were any discussions I
was interested in. For the past however long, more often than not,
I just make all new posts 'All read' because I *know* I'm not inter-
ested in the majority of them.

It's kinda like what's going on with our guild right now. Our guild
leader and a chunk of the officers are going to EQ2. The new guild
leader and some of the officers remaining are seeming to be heading
towards taking the guild in a different direction than the guild
that I *joined* was going. I didn't join the guild they seem to
be trying to make it into so, it seems highly likely that I'll be
leaving it in the near future. Just like this newsgroup right now
isn't the one I started reading.

Of course, this doesn't mean that I expect anyone to change anything
they're doing or not doing. It's just the way I'm leaning now.
