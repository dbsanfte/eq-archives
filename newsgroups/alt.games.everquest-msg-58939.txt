  Good AC and melee?  Of all the healer classes, they have the WORST AC and
melee, between their limited weapon selection and inability to wear chain or
plate armor.  Their melee skill caps are relatively low, the only real melee
skill they learn is Dodge (which casters learn eventually too) and druids
can't be large races so they can't even bash.  Only intelligence casters are
worse in melee.

  I suppose it would depend on the weapon the druid is using.  Generally
speaking, my druid character (above level 20) could never do significantly
more damage in melee than he could do by spending that time meditating
instead, and throwing in a well-placed nuke here or there.

  To me it would seem the main reason a druid would melee above level 20 or
so would be to build Defense skill to boost their somewhat dismal AC, but in
a group scenario, as you noted, you're probably not going to get aggro'd on
too much so you won't have as much an opportunity for skill boosts.
