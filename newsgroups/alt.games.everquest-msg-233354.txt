Their chat handle was prefaced with "GM".  I dunno what the structure
is now (just started playing again after over a year off), but guides
in chat were distinguished by having a different color only, no "GM"
label back when I played.  i.e. "GM-DarkTyger" vs "DarkTyger".  Ah
whatever, it could've a senior guide for all I know.  Anyway, I'm not
expecting anything to happen until GoD/next patch comes out.
