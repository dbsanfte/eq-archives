Yeah, that was my bitch as well...I mean, there already is PLing and
twinking going on (I just twinked my new bard-to-be with orange con armor
and a friend twinked it with an orange mace)...why doesn't loot rot?  They
took EQs somewhat negative (depending on opinion) and swung it way the hell
the other way, making it just as much a negative.   A compromise situation
would be much better.
