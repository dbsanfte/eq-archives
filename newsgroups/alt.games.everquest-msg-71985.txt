OK, you have convinced me against using "trash basic"

How about this...

;
(defun Mob_aggro ( / dmg_taken dmg_recieved mob_health player_heath)
 ;runs mob aggro function
 (setq dmg_taken (* rnd_damage mob_level))
 (load attack_graphics)
);defun
;;;
(defun LIST-TO-STRING (lisst)
  (setq strng "" indx -1)
  (foreach n lisst
    (setq indx (1+ indx))
   (if (< indx (length lisst))
    (setq strng (strcat (nth indx lisst) "," strng))
   );if
  );foreach
  (setq strng (substr strng 1 (1- (strlen strng))))
);defun LIST-TO-STRING

this a little more up to date?  :-)

anyone recognize this moronic language?
