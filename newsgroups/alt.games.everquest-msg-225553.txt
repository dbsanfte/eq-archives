It's one of the best examples of a free market around, but people still 
try and pressure you into selling at their price, especially tradeskill 
made items.

My 250 gnome tinker sells stuff at a price he feels is 1) worth his time 
and 2) still a good profit.  I got accused by the tinker item price 
fixing cartel on my server, of crashing the prices and market for 
collapsible containers.  Weird, but there you go.

What is annoying, but unavoidable, is the act of selling tradeskill made 
items for well under the cost to make, because you power skilled by 
chucking cash at it and just want to get rid of the stuff as quickly as 
possible.

For some items, that can kill the market quickly.

Nothing that can really be done about it - but it's still frustrating. 
Someone on our server is selling Gauz presses for less than the cost of 
the mana battery it takes to make them.
