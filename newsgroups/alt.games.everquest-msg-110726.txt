I for one would give a rats arse if they turfed eq and went with just eq2.
Sure I play eq right now and have an array of characters from little n00bs
to the higher levels, but I think I'd scrap them all and just start fresh in
eq2.  Even with the expansions, new characters etc I find the game gets
stale... .especially in the high end game.

eq2 would be a pleasant start again.  my 2 cents.
