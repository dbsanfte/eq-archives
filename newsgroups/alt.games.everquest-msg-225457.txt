Probably because the guild officer who changed it knew you just 
had to do three things to make life hard for them:

Step one - scroll the chat box to the tell telling you the new MOTD
was to tell you as soon as players got on

Step two - Report <asswipe>

Step three - petition for being harassed. 

See how funny they think it is when they're warned for harrassment.


Of course, I'm vindictive as hell, YMMV.
