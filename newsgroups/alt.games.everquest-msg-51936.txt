That's Immolate, level 29. Expect to see a lot of resists on it, though.
At level 29, when I was hunting mobs at or near my own level, the 
Immolate resist rate was ridiculous. However, by the upper 40s, 
versus mobs 5-10 levels below me, resists became uncommon.

Immolate doesn't get an upgrade until level 52, btw. Root/dotting
at level 51 was a drag. Some mid-blue mobs require four applications 
of Drifting Death + Immolate. Glad I have a necro partner most of 
the time.

At 52, Breath of Ro is a breath of fresh air indeed.
