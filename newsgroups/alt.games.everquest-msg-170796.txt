See, now, I'd support conservative snipping... :)

I think both pairs of terms have that problem.  I think part of the reason 
for it is that they tend to be portrayed as a binary opposition more than 
a continuum.  Ie, the Democratic party is definitely more left-wing and 
more liberal than the Republicans, but they're still all very conservative 
from my point of view.

Eh, I think that radicals come in many stripes, and there are definitely 
right-wing radicals, whose views are definitely better served by more 
conservative associations, and left-wing radicals that will agree more 
with liberals.  And then there are those who are off the map entirely.  
And then there are people whose notions are not all that radical, but 
still don't fit well in either the left-wing or right-wing category, like, 
say, Libertarians.

}> Conservatives have our share of those, as well.  They're what Limbaugh (hah,
}> I saw you twitch involuntarily) refers to as Republicans in Name Only.
}> Think Jim Jeffords, Lincoln Chafee, or John McCain.
}Yeah, get those damned conservatives out of the party!  We want only
}lock-step reactionaries who know how to follow orders here!

See, now, 'reactionary' is a term I'd use to describe a right-wing 
radical...  I dunno who those first two you listed are, but McCain I'd put 
on the left end of the conservative spectrum, with a bit of a nudge up 
toward libertarian.  As conservatives go, I find him pretty agreeable.

}I don't see either party providing a home for a truly conservative 
}person.

Yeh, they don't provide much of a home for a true liberal, either.  Who 
are these fools, and why do we keep electing them? :)

Well said. :)

}>>Xenophobic behavior is morally wrong.

Sanjian looks tranquil.

I don't see what needs clarifying there... he's saying that acting out of 
an unreasonable fear of someone being different from you isn't something 
he approves of.  Personally, I agree.

You're both right.  Now the only remaining challenge is making sure the 
current government doesn't lose sight of that.

I thought this was funny as all get out, but kinda scary too:

}Condemning people for "wrong" thinking, whatever the words used.

Unfortunately, college professors end up having to assign grades a lot, 
whether they're liberal or conservative.  That's part of why I'm not 
likely to ever be a teacher.
