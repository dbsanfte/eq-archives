First, it hasn't been VI for some time now, it's Sony Online
Entertainment.  I mention this because the association with who you
think is screwing you would be incorrect since the majority of the
original core design team is no longer with the company.

Second, it's called capitalism.  This is not something you need to
function in daily life like gas or food, it's recreation.  There's
nothing in the constitution about life, liberty, and the persuit of
happiness while getting EQ add-ons for free.

The second point is mostly tongue in cheek for those with thin
skins...
