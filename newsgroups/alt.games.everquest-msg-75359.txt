I have a monk character and during a battle I cant see whats going on. Most
people would hit attack and see their character swing weapons and kicking
the mob. I see what amounts to distored colors of flashing light and some
type of movement going on. When the fight is over there is no problem and I
see everything fine. This is very strang ---- any ideas?
