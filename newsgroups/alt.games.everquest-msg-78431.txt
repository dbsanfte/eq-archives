That's net.  With all 56 rezzes.  In level 59.  Pretty painful, but not as 
bad as the yellow bubble plus our pullers lost learning ToV.  (Of course 
they were in 60, but it's still a lot of exp.)

Depending on the level range of your guild Mistmoore is good, Sol A is 
also.  There are a number of places in Kunark, Velious may be a bit high 
level.  The nice thing about Mistmoore is that it's fairly open, and you 
can work your way in and start with the easy mobs.  I know that I was 
soloing Mistmoore yard trash at 30, and getting great EXP duoing with a 
warrior.  A full raid force can be lots of fun there, but some of the 
stuff is just too damn tough for even a raid of level 30 playes.
