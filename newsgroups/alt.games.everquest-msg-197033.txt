EQ was originally only 50 levels deep (someone said 45 recently).  Before ROK
release, you had only Antonica, Fadwer, and as an afterthought, Erud.

Imagine if you can a world that small.  Vox and Nafalgen the big targets.  Only
Paladins had an epic quest.  Transportation consisted of wizard and druid ports
or walking and taking the boats, and no gate potions or TL's either.

Nowadays, many players don't even see levels 1 to 50 as more than a speed bump,
50 to 60 are gearing up a bit, and 61 to 65 are finishing the leveling so you
can get down to serious raiding.  Even then, there are hundreds more AA to get
so that exp continues to have a point to it.

EQ has seriously evolved, not just in player attitude, but in scope and breadth
as well; you can't really spend too much time worrying about what the game was
originally intended as, when it underwent massive changes structurally, balance
wise, and so forth, plus the underlying mission statement has changed, the guy
at the hem has changed, the controlling company has changed...

If people were playing EQ now the same way they were when it was first released,
I'd frankly be astonished.
