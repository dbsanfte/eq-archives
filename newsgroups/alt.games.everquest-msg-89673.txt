Hi, I to have had exactly the same trouble. I got the initial game a month
or so ago free with PC Zone. I loved it so much that I decided to buy
Trilogy. It arrived yesterday but when I tried to install it I too got stuck
at the same point. I was still able to access the Original Everquest I had
installed from PC Zone as Trilogy installed to a different directory. I
logged on a "shouted" my problem to the other players. Someone advised me to
uninstall Trilogy and logged into the Original everquest and click on the
"register expansion" option. I am not sure whether this was the right thing
to do but everything seems to work fine. I assume I will be asked to install
"Ruins of Kunark" & "Scars of Velious when my character reaches those areas.
If that is not the case can someone let me know please.

Val
