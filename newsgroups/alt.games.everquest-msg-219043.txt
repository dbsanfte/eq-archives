I'd say the same thing, and its always stuck in my craw that
people running around in chain and leather are taking less damage
than those of us clad in wall to wall sheet metal.   Clerics
ought (in my opinion) to be able to off sponge mobs the same way
shamans do... but really since they take about the same damage
and have a far more practical heal line for the purpose, thats
not the case.  And bards... well their damage output sucks, their
damage mitigation sucks, hands down the worst of all the melee
classes... if you want to think of them as a melee class at all.
