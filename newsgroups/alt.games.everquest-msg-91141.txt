Most of the posts that get that sort of response (can't say I've seen fag
used in here for a while) are along the lines of can't get on, this sucks,
Verant sucks, we should get 1 mnth free, Verant sucks, this sucks, my Dyson
sucks etc (feel free to add a "fucking" before any of the afore mentioned
"sucks") these are now actually posted as flamebait but used to be genuine
posts, I think. So if that person who suffering from such a vacuum in their
EQ gaming feels so, why not suggest they don't play...seems reasonable to
me, maybe the way it is suggested isn't reasonable but the sentiment is.

So to sum up, if you don't like the posts here then fuck off, fag.

I can't login, verant sucks, they should pay my laundry bill for all this
downtime.

CF
Is it fixed?
