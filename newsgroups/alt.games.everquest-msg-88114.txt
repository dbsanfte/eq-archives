Were you logging in on a character in the bazaar?  I had the same
problem, and turned off human models (actually, I only had human
models on - so all of them are off) and got in fine.  I can turn
the models back on and log into the character in the Nexus, but 
any attempt to enter the bazaar crashes me to desktop, until I turn
the human models back off.
