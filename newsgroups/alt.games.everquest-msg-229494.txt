A) They didn't, were rated as one of the lower DPS classes, useless for 
most purposes, and relegated to soloing, which was a process of quadding 
a round of blue mobs, then sitting around forever, and repeating.  To 
level, a good book and a safe place to sit were required tools.  OR, 
rarely, a wizard could find an AE group, which meant killing 70 mobs at 
at time instead of just 4... but sitting just as long after.

B) Back then melee classes were also much less well equipped, 
"effective" is a relative thing; if you are doing 90DPS and the rogue is 
doing 100DPS, no problem.  But if the same level rogue is now doing 
150DPS, the wizard needs more mana flow, less mana spent, and more 
damage per cast, in order to also do 150 DPS, just to keep up; you have 
the same spells at the same level as ever, "balance" is set with the 
assumption that focus items and mana regen are available.
