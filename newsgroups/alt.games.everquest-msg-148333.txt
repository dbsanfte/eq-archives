}Umm yeah but 500pp is friggn steep for just that, maybe like 30-50pp.

No, 500pp is a very reasonable price.  I don't usually charge for less 
than ten blocks either... Larger orders it's a matter of, if you already 
have it in the same zone as me and I'm not actually doing anything, I'll 
do it for a donation.  (And yes, I do mean donation... although if the 
donation is zero, I'm likely to get bored halfway through and run off. :) 

I think it's come up twice so far that someone wanted more than ten 
bricksish.  One time, The window popped up with 300pp without me even 
saying anything, the other time, 500pp.  And both times, I made a friend. 
:)

CG, I think you may be underestimating what 29 bricks of Brellium cost. :)
