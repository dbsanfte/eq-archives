I wandered into Najena at level 52 to get an item for my baby monk and
proceeded to fall into a jail cell near Rathyl's room.  I didn't
remember how to get out and the one other person there couldn't figure
it out either.  I ended up using a Thurg. potion and got out but now I
am wondering what I should loot to be able to leave the cell on my own?
I don't plan to fall in again but...
Also, how rare is Ekeros ?
