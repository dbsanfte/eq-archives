It doesn't make sense because it's not stable. All it takes is for one
necro to lose his faith in Cazic (or whatever) and discover that being an
agnostic heretic has no impact on one's necromantic abilities and then
announce it to the world. At that point, the cat's out of the bag. And
agnostic folk (or even good!) folk interested in necromancy will make their
own schools.

As for being hunted by the 'True Necromancers of Cazic Thule', you can see
that it hasn't really put a crimp in the numbers of human Rodcet Nife
clerics, necromancers of Bertoxxulous, Tribunal shamans, or anyone else
who starts off KOS to CT necros. In fact, all a newly-agnostic necro would
have to do is bop to Plane of Knowledge or Plane of Tranquility and there's
*nothing* they could do about it!
