cancel magic gives the mob a very small pass-on-its-agro-to-another-mob
radius. probably siphon str does to i havent tried it.
also u can pull with cancel magic and you wont get summoned ( i think -not
sure)

if you can pull them with SS let us know because it is a cheaper
faster-casting spell.

its up to you really. do u have jboots, if not then i would deffo get at
least 1 point in run speed asap.
im getting all 3 in run speed now at lvl54 even though i have jboots. i will
leave them in bank just in case of a nerf.

all the rest i will wait till im lvl 60, or maybe do a 90 xp 10 aa on the
regen one.
