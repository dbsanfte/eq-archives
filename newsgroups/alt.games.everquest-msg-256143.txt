It is a p.i.t.a. quest, but the result was ever so worth it - in my
opinion.  The ability to click and rez a fallen tank without having to
worry about mana (and spell slot) is nice.  To do it on the fly in the
midst of an event is priceless.

I'd wager that most raiding guilds certainly DO have it as a
requirement for reasons already mentioned by others.  Even non-raiding
guild it sure is useful though.  Got a small raid going on with 3
groups that wiped?  Do you really want to cast/med/cast/med for way
too long?  Or would you rather click 18 times and still have a full
mana bar?

I did the Bergurgle camp with an assortment of druids.  They needed
the corrupted drop there anyways, and they helped with EB and the
fights.  The camp itself is very very easy (just swim up to the top
floor and keep it clear [except for one mob that you don't want to
ever touch!]).  The temple piece is trivial to one group now.  The Sol
A camp is tedious as hell, but at least easy.  That's the part I
didn't enjoy too much until I just started wantonly killing everything
around the area /rawr!

Ixi is fun.
Chardok can be fun if led by someone who knows what they're doing.
Ragefire is trivial these days.

Worst part?  All the runs back to the quest folks on that stupid
little island...  and shard camping.  Try and do shard camping with 40
- 50-something chars so someone at least gets some experience. =)
