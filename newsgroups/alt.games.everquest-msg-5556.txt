I've done a fair amount of charming with relatively low CHA on my druid,
75 if I recall.  Since I try to keep pets snared and I go into it with
low expectations as to charm lasting I'm tactically prepared when it

sending them against, heh.  Pretty useful in the right place either as
an actual pet or just to use as crowd control on an add if it happens to
be an animal.
