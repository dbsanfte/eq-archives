I'm with Lokari on this, as you already know.  If you want to post
the commandments, or for that matter the Magna Carta (it is after
all relevant to U.S. "common law" since it is British and predates
the Declaration of Independence), in an exhibit hall (or education
wing or what have you) that is part of a court building that'd be
fine.  But they simply don't belong in the courtroom itself.
