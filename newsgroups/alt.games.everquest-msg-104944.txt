there are some router issues apparently, all of a sudden like 100
people (inclding me) showed up in chat, all from different servers,
all just had lagged out.  i just quit out, rather than listen to
everyone wonder whats going on.  The GM that was in there said it
seems to be a routing issue at first glance.

p.s. web page loads fine for me
