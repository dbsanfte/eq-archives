Yep, the character of the server is having a low population I guess.
Won't be playing there again now after all. The odd thing is they made
FV only one but SZ 3, seems like it should be reversed since you have
no PVP abuseable advantage on FV ( Your level 6 character irritates me
so my level 9 twinked to the gills SK is going to put it down, etc.)

I really liked the alignment restriction, it made it more fun with a
barbarian shaman because they can be neutral (group/buff anyone) so
there was  a real reason to learn other languages.
