Nope, you're not alone.

Erudites look weird with the new foreheads.  Their women used to be
the best-looking.  Now...

My Dwarven paladin looks like he dropped about half his weight; looks
like a stocky Halfling now.  No longer is he a Dwarf.

Ogres used to look decidedly non-human.  Now, they just look like fat
men.

My Halfling / Dark Elf Rogue used to look great in his Ry'Gorr.  It
looked all sparkly and bright (Halfling) or had that great flame
pattern on it (Dark Elf).  Now, it looks a lot more like chainmail,
and a lot less interesting.

Despite the ruination of my armour, I do think Halflings still look
good.

Dark Elves aren't quite as sexy as they were, but they're still
good-looking.


The only ones I have turned on are Dwarves and Halflings.
