When you poison you are *not* poisoning the weapon, no matter what any other
player will tell you.  You are basically adding a proc to your *next*
piercing attack.  This can be done with either hand or throwing a piercing
weapon (ie dagger, but not throwing dagger).  Backstab, in this context,
does not count as a piercing attack even though it does require a piercer.

Thus, you can apply poison and wield non-piercers to prevent that proc, but
you'll lose any backstab attacks.

Incidentally, the thrown option has a very limited range (usually 30'-50'
max)

Rumour has it that VI is throwing around ideas for multiple procs from one
poison, stacking poison vials, etc.

There are dozens of poisons, some specifically for the undead (Liquid Silver
series) and these ones do the most DD damage of any.  Also, vs. Animals and
vs. Summoned (pets)
Remember, Shammy's usually get resisted as Magic, we get resisted as Poison.
That has an advantage in higher-level encounters since so many tough mobs
have really high MR (but not always PR) so we can get a 'vulnerable to
magic' poison on them before the shammy can do the same effect.

There are reasons to go into Neriak or other 'dark' cities.  With my mask, I
can bank in Grobb, Oggok, or the Overthere as I wish.  Toxdil in the tunnels
will respond to non-DEs.  The mask also allows Barbs to fit into rooms they
can't duck into, and allows Ultravision to the wearer (when activated).
Know when *not* to use it, too.  Currently, if I am using the mask I
*become* KoS in Erudin.

Indigo Brotherhood faction is veeeeery hard to gather.  I believe that
killing the elven slaves in Crushbone will get some, but I'm not sure if I'm
remembering right.
