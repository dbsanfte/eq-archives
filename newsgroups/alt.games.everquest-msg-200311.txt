What I found annoying was the drop rate, it was closer to one in 100 mobs 
for me for the drops I have gotten so far.  I do understand that it was 
intended for a lower level spell, but, they introduced it after I was well 
above being level appropriate for the mobs in question.

Maybe I was just unlucky, or maybe you were just lucky, don't know.
