It is true.  Some healing spells can 'Drain Into' a Improved
healing device.  There was a small discussion on this about
6 months ago.
I personally didn't see it take away any health potential when
draining, but the other person I was talking with said they saw
that.
What I did notice was it had nothing to do with the item, just
the spell.  So my Zaharn's Coronet would sometimes absorb
mana into it, as would my Book of Obulus.  I didn't notice
it at first because I was always casting Healing & Greater
Healing with my Obulus.  When I went to spam cast minor
heal (to get specialize up to 51) I noticed sometimes the
Book would also be drained into.
So from my experience its a Improved Healing item and
the light / minor healing spells that cause this effect.
