If you're looking for droppable items, Fishbone Earring is the cheapest
item 
with unlimited charges of enduring breath on it. Next up from that
would
probably be a Knotted Turtlebone Ring.

If you're looking for something you dont have to spend pp on, there
are
no-drop EB items you can get as well. If you're a high enough level,
you
can kill undead Shissar in The Grey for organs, and turn 3 of them into
a
quest NPC in Katta for an EB necklace (note: if you're KoS in Katta,
you
can't do this). The second place you could get a no-drop EB item is in
Siren's Grotto. The seahorses and swordfish rarely drop a primary slot
only
fishing pole with EB, and the sirens can rarely drop an EB necklace.
