There is a gnome, i think magician with no faction hits,
that some guildies used to solo through 44-46.  She spawns
by the merchants that are close to the zone between lesser
faydark and steamfont, IN lesser faydark.  They said
occasionally they had one of the others join in, but was
fairly easy to single pull.  The guildies who soloed her
with a cleric and a shaman respectively, so the ability to
heal might be necessary, not sure.
