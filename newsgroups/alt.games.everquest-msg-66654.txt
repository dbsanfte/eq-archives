Yes, you won't have the velious inventory or transparency features.
Velious is 14.99 now in a mini box at the station store though.

The enhanced GUI which abolishes the old switch to 640x 480 interface
was supposed to come with luclin but did not make it in time. They are
still working on it though and said they will post more info as to
when its coming out when its done. It will still be a feature of
Luclin. At that point everything you do will be at the same res you
regularly use including the bank, your inventory, buying from vendors,
giving quest items to npcs, etc.
