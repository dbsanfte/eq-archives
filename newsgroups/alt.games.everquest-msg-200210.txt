Well, I'm not sure that it's even *possible* to aggro NPCs in PoK...  As
a test case, I've turned on DDD and stood next to guards without aggroing
them. Don't get any "winces" messages from them either.

It always seemed to risky to try in Nexus. And practicing songs in Bazaar
might be construed as a griefing tactic :)

My personal favorite training zones are PoK (if I'm feeling lazy and
inconsiderate) or Arena (off Lake Rathetear).
