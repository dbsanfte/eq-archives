Ok.  I have a question.  Just to get back to the original one, which has
since been long lost.

Why is it so much more dangerous for you to run an ActiveX app prodcued by
Sony than it is for you to install software provided by the exact same
company?  It would seem that any kind of malicious code they wanted to
install on your system, would be easier to hide in the beta program than on
the website... yet you have no qualms about installing it, and major ones
about turning ActiveX on to visit one site?

It would seem to me that either you trust Sony or you don't?
