Warriors, clerics and rogues do NOT have it easy "the whole way through"
unless they are very outgoing and make lots of friends.  Up until level 39 a
druid or shaman heals just as well (or well enough) as a cleric.  ANY melee
class does just as good a job (or good enough) tanking.  Rogues?  What the
hell are they good for beyond being "just another melee class...one you
can't quite trust" until level 50?

Unless you mean "the whole way through [the 50s]."

But yeah, enchanters have it easy starting at level 16.
