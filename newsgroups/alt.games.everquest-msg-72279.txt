I admit it--I'm a total novice when it comes to computers.  But, I installed
2 256MB RAM chips (computer came with one 128MB chip which I took out, not
knowing if I could leave it in--there's room for 3 total).  And, what's
more, everything booted up afterwards.  But how can I tell if all 512MB is
being used?

The "online support" says that there's nothing to change with any settings,
and that the computer will automatically be able to tell how much RAM is
being used.  But one of the sensors on Norton Utilities tends to say that
only 100MB RAM is currently free.  Which seems to be a little less than half
the diagram of the sensor.

I'm not even sure if that made sense.  But if someone could tell me how I
check how much RAM I have in Windows Me, I'd much appreciate it.

Thanks
