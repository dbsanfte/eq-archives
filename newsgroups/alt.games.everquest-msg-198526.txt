I have a 20/34 sword, a 17/20 hammer, and have been in situations where I
have been oom more than I can count. I'd say there are fights so close druid
melee counts. The ones where the alternative is being beaten to death
without striking back, for example. You can't always run away, some mobs
don't run no matter how injured, some mobs summon for example, and dying
because the enemy has 200 hits left but you can't land a final few blows is
frustrating.

This is the first I have heard that a weapon doesn't need to be used to
proc? I assumed that proc was checked every time a hit occurred? Can anyone
occur that procs can occur when a weapon isn't even swung? Or do you mean
the rogue riposted and the weapon procced?
