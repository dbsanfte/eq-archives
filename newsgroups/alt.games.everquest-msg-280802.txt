I've seen the "fix the boats, fix the quests, fix xyz" stuff.  It
sounds like "more of the same".  Doesn't seem like it would keep
people involved.

As far as dynamic zones, that sounds similar to PvP play in WoW (even
on the PvE servers): as a result of a Horde raid, you might end up
with whatever town you are in decimated for awhile.  It's interesting
and fun when people raid,  but it can be pretty annoying, even though
the NPCs repop in a few minutes.  If you are saying that it might be
days or weeks when you can't enter your home city to do quests, etc, I
think you've come up with a new way to get rid of people.
