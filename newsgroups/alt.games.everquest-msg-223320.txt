I believe that the mob is no-aggro anyway.  He will stop if a side passage
has a mob that is too close to his path, but in the (admittedly few) times
this has happened he has never helped us kill those mobs or been attacked.

SOE *did* mention that they have been studying the problem with collection
drop rates, and it is rumored to be fixed in the last patch.  I agree that
the >27 thing was probably bs.  This is the only type that I have on my
do-not-take list.  If I wanted to test betaware I'd log into Test.
