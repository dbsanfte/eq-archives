I want to visit the east wing of Charasis tonight, for the first time
ever, to try to get my husband his 4 glowing iksar skulls and 1 dusty
iksar skull.  From all I read, the east and south wings are the place to
go to get these fast, specifically because they contain the highest level
mobs.

How will a 60 ranger/shaman pair fair in this wing with it's HTing mobs?  
I'm tempted, for the first time ever, to get Virtue before I go somewhere,
just because I am freaked out by the "can't zone out" bit...but without
any buffs other than ours, I have about 3500 hp.  Shaman does not have
malo or torpor :(, but has epic.


P.S. Does anyone know details about what the improvements/changes to
Charasis will be?
