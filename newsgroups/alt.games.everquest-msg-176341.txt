Hail and well met!

I am looking for someone who can create a great looking layout for a
new MMORPG trading website. The site has been in the works for over 2
years and everyone who has seen it has no doubt on its success.
Unfortunately, the current layout is boring. If you have experience in
creating gaming site layouts and are interested in this, please please
email me at angel@xev.net. I would prefer if you included a sample url
of your work.

Thank you,
Ken
