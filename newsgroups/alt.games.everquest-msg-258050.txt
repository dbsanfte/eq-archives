Subject: Add EQ to another comp without disks?

If I already have an EQ account but don't think that I know where my original
disks are is there any way I can easily add it to a laptop I'd like to play
from for a while?  I went to eqlive site and was gonna download original
trilogy but it wouldn't let me do it if I'm an existing customer.  Can I just
download it as if I'm a new account and then change names?
