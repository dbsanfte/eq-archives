    This is the Order Of Things, before PoP:

    Get Tash and OOS on the mob. They cannot be resisted. Also get Malo on,
which cannot be resisted. Mala is a weaker version of Malo, so if you have
someone with Malo that's what you use. Once these three are on, you attempt
to get Malosini on. It can be resisted (which is why the others come first),
but reduces resists more than Malo and will overwrite it once it lands.
