Agreed, and some other thoughts from the "lessons learned" category in our guild
and things I've seen with other guilds we run into:

First, *Never* ... *Ever* do any active "random" recruiting. If you have people
running around various zones /shouting "The Order of Ancient Dragon Biscuit
Stompers is looking for new members. Send tells!" you'll just look like a bunch of
fucking idiots.
Second, sponsors. Anybody who is either expressing an interest in joining, or has
been targeted by a member as a potential recruit, should have to have a member
sponsor them, and only after (as Stan said) they spend some time grouping with
members and/or officers to get a feel for their play style.
Third, Standards. You should have minum level requirements (ours happens to be 20
unless you're an alt) but make it at least high enough that you know it's somebody
who's fairly serious about playing and will stick around.
Fourth, Reputation.  Have your officers/GL ask around in guild chat during your
consideration period, and with other non-guild friends. Is this person actually a
KSing loser who's just putting on a good face right now to try to get in? If they
have a bad enough rep, it won't be hard to find that out.
Fifth, Needs of the Guild.  If you already have forty druids and twenty warriors,
but you have two clerics and one wizard, you may want to lower the minimum level
requirement on a case by case basis and/or tell officers to be more active in
keeping an eye out for unguilded members of those classes. You can get a really
big, good group of friends built into a very nice "family style" guild, but if you
get up to higher levels where you are inclined to start tackling the harder, more
complex stuff, and you have serious holes in your lineup, your'e going to have
problems. You should be able to field a good number of *well rounded* groups for a
guild raid, outing, etc.

Just a few thoughts to consider.
