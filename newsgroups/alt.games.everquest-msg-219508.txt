Because it's all but killed my guild, something which has pretty much
clinched my decision to quit when my current billing period ends. And
instead of finding people in the old usual haunts or spread out here
and there, they're all scurried away doing some dungeons over and over
and over and over again.
Note the difference between shark jumping and coffin nailing, btw.

Yes, that would be the shark jumping. LoY has left me underwhelmed,
especially with all the neon pink ogres it introduced.
