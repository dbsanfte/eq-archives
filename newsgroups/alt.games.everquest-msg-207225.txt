One very useful thing about SCM/SCRM you haven't mentioned... DA. DA
lasts 3 ticks, 18 seconds. With SCRM (50% increase) that's 27 seconds.
While focus effects don't affect DA, SCM/SCRM does.

Normally if you DA/sit/camp you'll be summoned after the 27 seconds
and killed, of course... but it means that a cleric that can sit and
hit camp and remain unmolested for only three seconds can be BDA'ed
and camp out safely. (Her own DA will probably not help, of course, as
as soon as it runs out she'll likely be summoned and killed.)

Also, what you say is generally true of *raiding* clerics. SCM
translates directly to a saving in peridots and mana when grouping
for experience. BoR is useful for speeding up SL (for clerics) and
slows and buffs for other classes - buffs aren't as big an issue, but
you probably want that slow hitting ASAP. Oh, and evac of course.

Otherwise no argument, mainly just pointing out the thing with DA...
