The United States: Iraq is developing weapons of mass destruction, is =
failing to cooperate with weapons inspectors and is violating its =
obligations under U.N resolutions. Washington says it already has =
Security Council authorization to use military force to disarm Iraq.

is rearming. Russia wants economic sanctions, imposed after Iraq invaded =
Kuwait in 1990, to eventually be lifted and says the council must =
authorize any use of force.

China: Supports continued inspections.

Britain: Prefers a second Security Council resolution authorizing any =
military action, but is expected to join U.S.-led action without one. =
Says Iraq is not cooperating or disarming and that time is running out =
for it to do so through weapons inspections.

France: Says inspections are starting to work and sees no justification =
for military action now. Paris has hinted it could use its veto to block =
council authorization for military action at this stage.

Angola: Supports continued inspections in Iraq.

Bulgaria: Indicated it would support U.S.-led military intervention =
without a Security Council authorization.

Cameroon: Supports continued inspections and has not taken a position =
regarding military action.

Chile: Supports continued inspections and has not taken a position =
regarding military action.

Guinea: Supports continued inspections and has not taken a position =
regarding military action.

Germany: Insists Iraq must be disarmed peacefully and has said it will =
not participate in any military intervention, even if the Security =
Council authorizes such action.

Mexico: Supports continued weapons inspections and could support =
military intervention authorized by the Security Council.

Pakistan: Supports continued weapons inspections and a diplomatic =
resolution of the conflict.

Syria: Damascus says Iraq is cooperating with its obligations under U.N. =
resolutions and has called for U.N. sanctions to be lifted.
