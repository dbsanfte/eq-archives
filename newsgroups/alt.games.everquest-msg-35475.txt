When this question has been asked in the past, some people have anwered that
if you are moving on the X, Y, or Z axis, you get interrupted.  I cast while
moving on the Z axis all the time, and it isn't a situation where I "recover
and continue to cast."  I will jump off a boat, with as minimal X/Y axis
movement as possible and cast Lev while sinking in the water and it works
just fine.
