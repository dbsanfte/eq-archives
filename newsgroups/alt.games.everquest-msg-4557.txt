It won't work.

In my long experience (20+ years) in online discussions, I've learned
that the ill individuals who act this way do so because they
know deep down that they can never make a name for themselves
via any real achievements or strength of character, so their
consolation prize will be to gain notoriety as the biggest
asshole around.

At least it's SOME sort of attention, which is "better" than
being a total nobody, right Avenger?

Yes, it's sick and ultimately self-destructive, but it helps
them get through the day.  At least they have a "purpose" to
dedicate themselves to, instead of having nothing but time
to dwell on their lack of any real accomplishment.  If they
can't impress people who have real lives, at least they can
annoy them, which is at least a tiny form of revenge.

What's even more pathetic is that these same people would
be cowed into speechlessness if they were around normal people
face-to-face.  Only when they are totally safe behind an
anonymous computer keyboard do they crawl out from under
their psychological rocks and start their "see how big of
a jerk I can be" dances.

Note that you'll NEVER see these attention-seeking trolls
posting under their real names.

And not only is it common for them to switch names when
they've thoroughly discredited themselves under their
old names, but it's also very very common for them to
post simultaneously under multiple names, in order to
manufacture the illusion of like-minded sickos helping
them out and applauding their behavior (ask yourself --
what are the odds of 2-3 similarly twisted trolls all
popping in here at the same time?).  Just sit down
for a moment and think about how sick that is, a
troll actually getting an ego boost by pretending to be
his own fan club...

Avenger is here entirely for the attention (no matter
what sort it might be).  Ignore him, and he'll cry
himself to sleep, then move on to fresh pastures.
But if you give him what he craves so desperately,
replies, he'll be here forever -- this sort of
deranged individual never tires of his quest
for being noticed, instead of being the nobody
that he really is.
