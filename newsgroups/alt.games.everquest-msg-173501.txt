The GMs should have some fun in these situations and use them to teach the 
idiots to listen instead of just attacking mindlessly.

They should go into Invulnerable mode and deathtouch anyone who attacks 
them ( before it is time ).  Script it so they don't have to manually do 
it.  If the final goal is to eventually have the players kill something, 
when it dies, hand out some turn-in type items to the ones that role-played 
the best instead of letting Mr. Shortterm DSP loot the item.  Have a =real= 
event set up that requires the PCs to cross several zone, etc.

It doesn't take that much intelligence to think up a minor quest for an 
event that doesn't require killing the GM, and punishing those who do 
attack the GM.

There are ways the GMs can thwart the fuckheads who enjoy just killing.  If 
the GMs _choose_ not to thwart them, then the GMs are as much to blame 
because they are going into the situation KNOWING the assholes are there 
and will be doing their best to ruin it.
