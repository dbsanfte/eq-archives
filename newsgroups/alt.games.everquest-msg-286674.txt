Yes it is :P  "You don't have a brain, so you play WoW" is a bash.
"EQ is a lot harder than WoW" is a statement of fact (though I may
disagree for the most part).

> WoW is an easier game, which the majority of people seem to prefer.

To be honest, I think it's mostly the fact that they learned a lot of
lessons from previous MMOs and made the game accessible.  In my
opinion, it's not popular because it's easy. It's popular because it
is a fluid, well-designed game that has a good company, pre-existing
fanbase  and IP behind it, and it came out with sane hardware
requirements.

It's not perfect by any means, and I personally really didn't like the
game at 70 (and quit), but that might be different if I was still 19
with 16 free hours a day instead of a few hours on the weekend.

That's great.  Just accept that most people consider the phrase "I
don't care what others play" doesn't come with tired insults.  It's
like if every person who ever mentioned EQ in WoW immediately followed
it up with personal insults aimed at its players (hrm...what would a
good one be?  I don't think being called old and stubborn is all that
insulting...).

Yeah, I was just lamenting the fact that it's so negative.  I got kind
of excited that there was activity, but was disappointed when it all
turned out to be flames.  Bad example.  I've been witness to some
extremely nasty arguments in in-game chat channels which usually focus
on bashing people who play games other than EQ.
