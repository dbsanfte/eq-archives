You are not alone.  I sent them my info for both my Win2k and WinXP
"machines" and
they never got back to me.  All the problems started right after the DX9
patch.  I was
running the game on a Geforce 4 4200 card.  I thought maybe if I buy a
different card
I'll have better luck.  I run out and buy a Radeon 7600 Pro.  Nope, same
thing.  So
maybe it's my OS.  I install WinXP on a different hard drive.  Update the
service pack,
update to DX9.  Latest video drivers.  Brand new EQ installation.  Hmm,
okay, this is
a little better.  Only crashes once in a while, not 50% of the time I zone,
or in PoK.  A
week later, Sony releases another patch.  Now my XP EQ installation is
crashing as much as
my Win2k one.  Ridiculous.  They need to work on this crashing issue before
they move on
to more expansions.

Before the DX9 patch, my game experience was rock solid.  I remember a while
back
EQ released a major patch and the same thing happened, crashing a lot.  But
within a week
or so, they patched it up and fixed it 100%.  Not sure why they are not
doing so now.
Maybe this problem is only happening to a small portion of the EQ population
?
