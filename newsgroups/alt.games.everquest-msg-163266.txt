Yup. In fact, I was in an argument on Tuanre in GFay once with my
druid. Someone claimed their alt HAD a lore CLS. I told him to show
me, and offered 2k that I had on me at the time just to see it.
Someone else chimed in offering another 10k.

He said the character was a ranger and in KC, too far away to bring
all the way to GFay over a silly argument. I told him I had guildies
who would add another 10k just to look the thing. I would port to DL
and meet him at KC, he could show me the sword, and if indeed his CLS
had a lore tag on it, I would port him around for free to collect on
all the offers to see it.

He suddenly shut up. Of course, he continued to auction his "pre-nerf"
CLS for an absurd price, but refused to respond to anyone else on the
matter. ;-)
