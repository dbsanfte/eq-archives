You can find me back a few more years if you look at my older email
addresses. Once apon a time I didn't use my real name as my handle,
and for a while my email changed twice a year. Makes it hard to track
my earlier stuff down, but it is out there.

Considering you're wrong and it was Annie who began flinging monkey
poop, and that you haven't successfully found any definition of
insinuation that isn't in some form an accusation, I'd say you're
wrong on both counts.

 the village, "now the Old Bear wants them talking as well? No good will
 come of *that*, I'll warrant. And who's to say the bones wouldn't lie?
 Why should death make a man truthful, or even clever? The dead are likely
 dull fellows, full of tedious complaints - 'the ground's too cold, my
 gravestone should be larger, why does *he* get more worms than I do....'"
