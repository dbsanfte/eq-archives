Besides, DAoC already did this.  They have semi-permanent buffs.  But
the caster can only keep a finite number of buffs up at once.  I actually
prefer that method - removes the need for a the caster to swap out and
recast buffs all the time, but they have to be around (no selling buffs
here) and have to make a strategic decision on which buffs to keep on 
which player.
