	There is no way to trigger her spawn.  She is a random spawn on a long
timer.

	Enchanter postulants typically create a mule and leave it camped at her
spawn point, checking periodically.  When she spawns you will have to call in
forces immediately to kill her, as you will almost certainly have competition.

	Good luck.
