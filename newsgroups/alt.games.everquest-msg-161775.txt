This *might* be a breakdown in communications, but not sure. We break
Fear with one group, but it's one group of our definite "A List". (Level
57 to 60, now 62/3, and the right spread of classes.) So with that in
mind, once you clear the breakin area and make it to the wall, they
could "clear" most of the zone of the trash mobs if the puller avoided
aggro. No way in hell they are taking down the minis or Dracho.
