when your family and life are oppressed (and killed) in the way the
Palestinians have been....
you'd risk your own life for a step closer to true freedom... especially
when your state has no comparable support.
"give me freedom or give me death"
think i got that quote right....

a realist?  realists deal with the truth... and are truly unbiased.
you have yet to list an unbiased, independant resource!
don't think of yourself as a "realist" when you have done very little
"realist" work.
you're a child who refuses to take part in real research and analysis.
have fun with that "realist" label.. becuase that's all you have.. a label.

then quit writing bullshit and list the sources!!!

the Saudi are finacially dependant on the U.S. as the U.S. is on them (U.S.
politicians anyway).
many countries have already made their support of Palestine and condemnation
of Isreal public, but they lack the financial/military support required to
do anyting more.  Reverse-imbargos require a strong economy that is capable
of breaking those ties.

> Sh-uuuuuuure it is, suuuure it is....  Go back and tell Historians of
WWII.

i'm sorry you don't believe in Social evolution... go back to your jungle
you ape.
times are changing... too bad some refuse to change.

> Missplaced "empathy" without proportinate rational thought is useless.

misplaced empathy?  how can you justify the killing of 1000+ palestinians?!
this sentence of your's was absolute bullshit with no real basis.

don't waste my time with the trivial... or did you simply run out of
bullshit to write?

> So why arn't the A-rab "brethern" coming to the rescue of the Pali's ?

refer to what i said earlier in this post.
