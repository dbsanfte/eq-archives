Well, whether you like them or not Mcdonalds fries always win best
french fry in yearly taste tests. But it looks like my asiatic
brothers are on the right track.


French Fries 
Author/s: Catherine C. Galley & Briavel Holcomb 


America's love affair with french fries started in 1789 when Thomas
Jefferson, fancier of French cuisine and especially of pommes frites,
introduced the delicacies to his fellow citizens when he returned home
after serving as American ambassador to France. Two centuries later,
french fries, those thin strips of potato cut lengthwise that have
been deep-fried until crisp, are internationally associated with
hamburgers and fast-food meals. Their popular success benefitted from
advances in food processing and the growth of the fast-food trade.
They became a fetish of the McDonald's corporation: "The french fry
would become almost sacrosanct for me, its preparation a ritual to be
followed religiously" wrote Ray Kroc in his book Grinding It Out: The
Making of McDonald's. Famous for their high quality, McDonald's french
fries are essential to the chain's success, with more than 6.8 million
pounds prepared every day in 1998. On the eve of the twenty-first
century, french fries changed national identity as fast-food ventures
in Japan and Southeast Asia promote them as "American fries."
