All tradeskills skillups are based on whichever stat, INT or WIS, is the
highest, or in the case of Smithing, STR is also considered.  Stats are
important for calculating the possibility of gaining a skill increase
(please don't ask the formula, I don't think anyone knows and it varies from
item to item) but do not affect the possibility of a successful combine.
Some people argue that it does, because you gain more increases on
successful combines, but this has not been proved.
