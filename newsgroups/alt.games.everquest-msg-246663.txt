But what can it do? I really don't know.

Could an activeX application set itself to run at start up? Could it set 
itself to lurk in the background and do whatever it wants to? Could it 
spread itself via messenger (disabled on my system until a malicious 
activeX from sony turns it back on *wink*) to other computers?

Once it's been run and the browser closed and computer turned off, what 
is the threat level to me next time I turn on the computer from an 
activeX component.
