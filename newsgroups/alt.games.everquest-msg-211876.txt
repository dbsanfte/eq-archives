You maybe right.  I have not hit the tier three POP zones yet.  A 62 Shaman
friend of mine has and said that most groups want 65 tanks.  But I have
Tanked the 63s that are in Veksar.  The named Highborns and nobles there.
Without any dificulty.  I started this at level 56.

And again.  For those who say Defense is only for raids.  I have been in
groups MTing when the healer went LD.  Defense has saved groups in this
situation.
