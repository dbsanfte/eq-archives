    A Barbarian Shaman couldn't hit like that, although I believe they could
nuke for that. In terms of what I've seen, I've seen Manaburn (wizard AA
ability) hit for 22000 damage, paladins using all their tricks and AA skills
hit for over 5000 against undead, and a warrior in my guild score a
crippling blow for just over 1800 damage.

    That same warrior recently impressed a friend of mine that was camping
Captain in KC with a full group. Warrior came in, asked if camp was taken,
then turned around and killed a Drolvarg Guardian in four combat rounds. His
first swing alone was a triple attack for 1160, 1160, 690.

    Depends. You cannot find 10000 plat in coin on a mob. You can find items
that players will pay 10000 plat or more for, however. You can also find
horses on some mobs, that if you do the "refund" quest in The Bazaar would
net you tens of thousands of pp.
