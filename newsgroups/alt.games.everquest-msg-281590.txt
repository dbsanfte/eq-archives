I really dislike what they've done. It is straight out of 
EQ2 and fancy corners to a target box or the chat screen 
means nothing at all. The horizontal button bar sucks. I 
hope there is a way to change it back, but haven't found it 
if indeed it does exist.

Mine changed and continues to change every time I log in...

I agree the new icons are very silly. They look very similar 
unless you look very close and distract you from what you're 
doing. This may change in time, I hope....

BTW, does your mouse work in full screen mode?
