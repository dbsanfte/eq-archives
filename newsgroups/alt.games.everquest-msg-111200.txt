 Probably. I regularly solo the Hands room in Karnors. I remember in my
earlier days many a times having most of our group wiped out trying to
get up there. Now I can clear it by myself. Well, for the most part.
Construct of Sathirs still give me a hard time.

 Exactly. The main focus on XP camps is XP. You want to grind through as
many mobs as possible to maximize time spent. This is a reason why, when
upper Sebilis is camped to hell, you can still find the Shrooms down
below uncamped. The XP just isn't worth it for time spent.

 This isn't to say I don't try new mobs and unconventional camps, but
that's not normally done when I'm in 'xp mode'.
