 It's not that unreliable. You have to know how to use it properly. You
don't just mash it everytime it ungreys. For it to "connect" your
special attack keys (Tiger claw, flying kick, etc) have to be ungreyed
at the end of the ID cycle. That's how it is with kick attacks anyway.
I'm not sure it applies to punches or not.
