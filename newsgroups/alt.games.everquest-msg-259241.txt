Sounds, I know, like some annoying learn spanish at home in your spare 
time phrase.

But.

I was browsing thru one of the web forums, where I saw someone mention 
that Berserkers are on the Plate Tank table.

I've heard before that there are several different defensive tables, and 
that which one you are on matters a great deal.

For example, I've heard (and even repeated) that Clerics and perhaps 
bards, despite wearing in some cases the very same pieces of plate armor 
as "real" tanks, despite having the same AC figure, seem to take hits a 
lot more like a post nerf monk, supposedly because they are on a 
different table.

This is, I think, supposed to be in addition to avoidance, (which is to 
say the various dodge, parry, riposte, block skills,) and all the AA out 
there to affect sponging.

Now A) I don't know what the tables even -are-.  Are they

I) Warrior/Knight
II) Ranger/Rogue/Beastlord
III) Monk/Bard/Cleric
IV) Int Caster

and B) How do they relate?

and C) Is this the same as soft cap, or is that yet another factor?

and D) Does this have anything to do with offense, or is it merely about 
defense?

and E) Is this about avoidance, mitigation, both, niether, or... what?

and F) Where do Berserkers land on that list above; I assumed given that 
they are wearing chain they'd be on table II), but from the one post I 
saw mentioning them it seems like they may be on table I), just as 
clerics and bards, who wear plate, should be on table I) but are on 
table II) instead (unless I'm wrong about that)
