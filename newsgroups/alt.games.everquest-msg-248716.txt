I have never served in the military nor am I a military type, I don't
like getting up early.  However, I do have several friends in the
Marines and they were much relieved that Bush won and not Gore.  Also
happy that Clinton is out.  They still are happy that Bush is in
power.

Yes people have died, yes more will.  I don't like it anymore than the
next but I, and my military friends, believe it's a justified
war/conflict/police action (whatever you want to call it).
