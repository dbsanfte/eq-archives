The place where it usually happens in PoK is the elevator.  It is bugged, 
and sometimes you fall through the elevator.  The other spot where there 
have been problems in the past, is zone in spots when they are crowded.  
One other factor is how much weight you are carrying, this affects the 
amount of damage you take from falling.
