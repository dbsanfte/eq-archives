Depends on my mood. Tirra tends to be formal and minds her thees and
thous. She is from Everfrost, and her demeanor is not warm. 

Tiru tends to use ye, yer, and y'all, but his accent is actually more
hick than scottish.

Sadly, I'm not all that consistent. So I use whatever accent infects me
at the time, and varies on the accent of whom I am addressing.

I see a lot of it, and I enjoy it. Hearing an accent encourages me to
roleplay in response.
