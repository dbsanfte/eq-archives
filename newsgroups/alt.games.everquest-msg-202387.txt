You don't want EQ in the new registry. Its better to have no enteries
for EQ at all, or a subsequent expansion tries to do some real stupid
crap for some weird reason. With no EQ registry info, you are always
politely asked what DIR EQ is in.

The crashing has nothing to do with it not being in the registry.
