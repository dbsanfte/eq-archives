Iksar can't wear Jaundiced armor, including the JBB.  You probably meant "non
iksar shaman" or perhaps just "shaman".  Otherwise, aye, I'll bet your iksar
shaman buddies are getting rid of their JBB, can't be upping their damage output
much at all to be carrying them around in their backpacks.

Going from 30DPS to 80DPS doesn't sound trivial.  You'd have to demonstrate that
he's going to do something reasonably impressive with that mana he's canni-ing
during the fight; depending on his group, he may be casting slow and then
nothing else of consequence (I see shaman grouped with clerics quite often).
And if he has a mount, then the JBB isn't eating meditation, just the canni part
of the mana flow, plus he can canni as needed either between fights or heck,
during, just the JBB part of his damage output will drop off.

Mind you, I'm not saying that the JBB either is or isn't worthwhile at high
levels, I'm just saying that what you post here isn't enough information to put
the question to bed.
