It's worse than that. Sony has tons of very distinctive IP that it created
(Short Sword of Ykesha, Color Flux, quest text for a zillion quests) that
show up on alla's, eqtrader, caster's realm, gu comics, wtf comics, magelo,
guild magic, class/guild/server boards, that Sony demonstrably knows about,
has known about for years, and has done nothing to curb. That Sony finds
them helpful for its EQ franchise is irrelevant to whether or not they are
violating copyright laws. A Yantis lawyer could make very convincing
arguments that, by not vigorously defending their IP laws against much
more egregious cases of copyright infringement, they've effectively ceded
it to public domain.
