I wonder how well the voice recognition works nowadays (or do they even
still support that?).  I tried it when they first added it, and it was way
too slow to be useful.  It had a lot of potential, though...and now
processors are faster, and the EQ engine is more efficient, so *maybe* there
is enough power left over for it.
