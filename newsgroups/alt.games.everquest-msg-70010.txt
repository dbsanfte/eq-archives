Hunt bears, sell HQ bear pelts. They generally go for 20-35pp,
depending on server. Hunt wisps, collect Greater Lightstones, and turn
them in for the Concordance of Research, sell CoR for 7-9pp back to
the merchant, depending on cha. Wisps are a tad out of your range at
lvl 8, though...barely, though.

Anyway, at lvl 8, it doesn't take "hundreds" of pp to buy the spells
and items you NEED, it doesn't even take one hundred.
