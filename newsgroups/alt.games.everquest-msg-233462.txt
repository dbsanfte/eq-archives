I almost wish I had made my mage an Erudite instead of High Elf.  People
will say stats don't matter because you can always get gear.  For raiders
I'm sure that's true, but I've struggled to max my int and there were a
bunch of times as I leveled up that the extra int would have been
appreciated.  That said, I can't complain much about being a High Elf mage -
it's worked well enough so far and every Tom, Dick, and Harry int caster I
run into these days is an Erudite.
