There are a few reasons for this:

A lot of people don't have html capable newsreader (most of these by choice)
Html posts are larger than plain text and therefore take up more bandwidth
without adding anything more to the message
Some ISP's don't allow html posts in non-binary groups (thanks for the info
biz)
And a few other reasons that I might have missed.

Its rude to post in html in a newsgroup because:

It costs people who don't get flat-rate net connections more money.
It slows down download for everyone on the group.
Most people won't be able to read it.
And even if we can read it, seeing a flashing lime green large point text on
a black field saying "Woot, I just finished X quest..." would probably
aggravate my migraine to the point of explosion.

So, how much is it worth for you to post in html?
