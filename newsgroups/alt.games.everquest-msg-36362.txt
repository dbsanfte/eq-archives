Level 3?  Wow.  That level is hell too, that sucks he KS'd you like that.

Again.  TROLL.  Its obvious you contain some kind of intelligence by the
cleanly compose message WITH use of punctuation.  With that said, its
extemely difficult for me to believe that you would get so upset over a
snake, bat or whatever else a level 3 hunts (sorry been awhile and I have a
druid to PL me through the irrelevant levels).

However, if I were to give you the benefit of the doubt, then I would be
seriously curious about something.  Are you going to bitch and put your
tanks on ignore when they are asking for heals?  Seeing as you are the
Cleric. <grin>

He was probably trying to break the ice, move on to some other subject, etc.
Though, I can understand how you would have realized this, reading your
message.

My suggestion is, should you not be just trolling around, keep  an open
mind, leave work at work, dont carry any bad attitudes about your pissy life
or real life transgressions into the game, flick that chip off your
shoulder, wow, nevermind, it appears you may be hopeless. :(
