Hmm, just noticed the effect of this adjusted respawn rate.

The day before I was farming snakes for eggs for dough for pies and it
took a few hours to put together a stack, with quiet a few dead times
waiting for the snakes to respawn. I was actually feeling guilty that
perhaps I taking kill stock away from a few newbies then operating.
However, a quick shout for joy from the newbie that he had finally
killed something else relieved that feeling. Little blighter level from
1 to 3 in the time it took me to collect a stack of eggs. 

Side benefit, someone ooc'd that they wanted a couple of snake skins and
offerred 2pp for them, so I quikcly handed over my side results and
scored 20pp. Which would have been very good for a newbie doing it.


Anyway, after the patch, I was able to farm a stack of snake eggs,
almost 3 stacks of snake skins, plus 2+ stacks of snake fans in an hour.
The slow part was waiting for the "slow"song to cast, then the DoT to
cast, then target another snake and repeat and don't forget to collect
the other corpses some time before they start disappearing.

With so many snake skins, I produced bog juice galore amd "hey, it
alcoholic, bugger selling it, lets work on alcohol tolerance" Hey great
stuff. Lets try mead. Oh, 8 bottles does awful things to the vision. Oh
well, it was almost all cleared up by the time I entered Innothule
Swamp.


So with snake eggs and snake skins so easy to farm now, I expect that
the price is going to drop a fair bit comparatively.

Is they any use for bulk snake fangs.
