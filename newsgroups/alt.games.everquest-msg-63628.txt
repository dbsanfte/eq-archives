You can begin the druid epic at any level, especially the foraging parts.

I believe that you cannot finish the druid epic below level 50, as some NPC's
required for it will not respond until you are that level.

As for what level you can complete the fights...  well, whatever level you can
get around 4 to 6 level 50 plus groups (depending on level) to kill the dragon
Faydear for you.
