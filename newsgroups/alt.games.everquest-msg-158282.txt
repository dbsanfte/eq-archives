Oh, I bet EQ is around for a LONG LONG while yet. I know a lot of ppl will
leave when EQ2 is out, and new games for the holidays come around to
entertain us all. People still play older games, and EQ is no different. I
know I for one switch around a lot. I leave EQ for a month, maybe 2, then I
return. I still play Quake 2, and half-life, and AOK, and a lot of other
games myself. I never leave EQ for to long. but again I bet 2-3 years from
now people will be playin' EQ still and finding enjoyment lvling.. (
soloing, and with new groups of ppl, and old friends alike. but a lot of
people will also be playin' EQ2, Earth & Beyond, and UO. May they never die!
