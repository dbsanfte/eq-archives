Go to bazaar and select Ranger, Hit Points and go through slot by slot
where you don't currently have raw HPs in and see what is available
and at what prices.  You should be looking to have 35 raw HPs in every
slot at a minimum (not including STA).  See what Kylong Darkmail
pieces are available, you never know MIGHT find some cheaply.

Soooo much stuff available in the bazaar these days at reasonable
prices, 13/20 1HS from LDoN for example for peanuts to go with your
Scion blade:

But honestly I'd recommend getting Swiftwind any way you can.  Can
mainhand the Scion Axe then and ditch the SCHW.
