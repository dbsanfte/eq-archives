Personally, and I know many here will disagree with me, I think
the best thing to do would have been to just put the guy on /ignore,
and *not* petition his name.

IMNSHO, names should only be petitioned for being patently offensive
(and no, I'm not talking about Trolls named "Nozepicker", that's
roleplaying if you ask me).  In 14 months of playing, the only
name I've ever seen that I felt truly *ought* to be petitioned
was "Wifebeater" -- and I did.  There are undoubtedly many
abused or formerly-abused women who play Everquest, and the
last thing they need when they go into a game is to be slapped
in the face with a reminder of that sort of attitude.

But for names that only rise to the level of "stupid or annoying",
I've never seen the point of petitioning them, especially since
a name that may be "annoying" to one person may be entertaining
to another.  I know I always get a smile when I see "Wini Dapoo",
whereas other people might be irritated by it.

Sure, some names are "against the rules".  Well so is driving
a mile or two over the speed limit, smoking pot, picking wildflowers
in Texas, or having oral sex with your spouse in at least a dozen
different states, but I know what most people would call someone
who jumped to phone the police every time he became aware of
a violation, and it would *not* be complimentary.

In the phrase of Thomas Jefferson, "it neither breaks my leg
nor picks my pocket" if someone has a name that's in violation
of the rules.  Most of the time, in fact, it amuses me.

You didn't like the guy's begging, so rather than use the
tool put into the game to help you avoid such things (/ignore),
you chose to vindictively cause him some grief by petitioning
his name.  Perhaps karma is a real thing after all, because lo
and behold, that started a chain of events which caused you
some grief in return.  What goes around comes around, and all
that.  When you take a shot at someone, expect some
incoming rounds yourself.

Personally, I seldom feel self-righteous enough to take it
upon myself to try to ruin someone's day, especially since
I know I don't like it when someone tries to do the same to me.
It wasn't like "Mrnicegy" was specifically trying to cause
you grief by begging, nor by his choice of name.  If you had
/ignored the begging (or just mentally ignored it, like I
do), odds are you'd never even "see" his "bad" name again
after that one time.  So when you go, "ah ha, I know how
to screw him", don't be surprised when some people (including
him) think you were being offensive yourself, and believe
that you had more of a motive than simply altruistically
improving the game environment.

"Mrnicegy" probably enjoyed his name, or else he wouldn't
have chosen it, and felt rightly peeved that you took
it upon yourself to ruin *his* gaming fun.  Consider
how you'd feel if the situation had been reversed.

The older I get, the more I learn that starting a war
over trivialities just isn't worth the trouble -- and
the more I learn just how many things I used to think
were Really Important turn out to *be* trivialities
after all.
