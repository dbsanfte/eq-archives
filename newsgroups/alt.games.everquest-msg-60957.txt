(Level - 15) X 5.  At 20 your max is 25.  Also, your first research poimt
acts just like all other skils and brings the skill to your level.  At level
16, add first research point and you have a 16 skill (and no ability to
raise the skill until level 19).  In your example, if you add your first
research point, your skill would be 20 with a max skill of 25, so 5 more
points may be added at the trainer.

As many as you want.  I have yet to gain a research skill point "in the
field".  I have never used the Concordance of Research as anything other
than a pack.

No.  They trivial at a higher level than the spell, usually, though not much
higher.  Generally they trivial within one or 2 levels of being able to use
the spell.
