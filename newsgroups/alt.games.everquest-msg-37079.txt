Oh. I *was* going to say that the PERL CGI server status scanner I wrote
worked fine - until I just checked it. Must have been a very recent change
to the status server.

Having taken only but a moment to look at the debugging info I built into
the software, it doesn't look like a change in the protocol, just in the
reply content (all the data appears to still be on the proper byte
boundaries...). As you say, the number of players returned seems to always
be 1. Sony's FAQ on the server status protocol appears to not have changed.

Which is really too bad, as the status protocol is poorly documented (the
LOCKED state isn't mentioned - it appears to be a reply where the number of
players is "FFFF", BTW). And a UDP reply that you can't tell in advance how
long it is, or isn't uniquely terminated, is kinda lame IMNSHO.
