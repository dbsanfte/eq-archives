I had a hill giant do that to me once. It was in the midst of his falling 
animation and I was hit for 88 damage by him. One could suggest it was a lag 
issue, but my ping wasn't high enough for that much of a delay. Also the giant 
would have been fleeing at that point so he shouldn't have been swinging at me 
anyway.
