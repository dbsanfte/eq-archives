Cobalt Scar is my favorite fishing spot so far. The cod for Cod oil for my
tailoring, the snapper is great for brewing (Trivial is 150 and you just
need to bring water). The Othmars love me and buy all my rusty daggers and
old sandels. I could retire on that beach if it wasn't for the
quad-kiters...
