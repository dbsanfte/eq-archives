Well, I happen to agree with you. I like history as much as the next person
(maybe more than some), and I loved the King Arthur Legend, but gimmee a
break, this game comes nowhere close to being as challenging as EQ. And hey,
if I want to immerse myself in history (or myth/legend, rather). I can
certainly do so at my local library. I'd much rather play a game because it
catches me, drags me in, and won't let me get away! And I am constantly
trying to figure things out in EQ (as everyone knows, who have read my
posts!) Put as simply as it can be -- I LOVE EQ.

And I hated DAoC.

Whatever that says... well, it says.
