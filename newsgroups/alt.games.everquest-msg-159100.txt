Its really a question of the tanks' HP, not the cleric's level.  Tank has to
have so many HP that when the heal hits, you are really getting your mana's
worth.  At 61 I still find myself using faster heals on 55 rangers... and at 40
I used Cheal grouped with a 60 paladin.  I draw a line at about 3000hp or so
for effective Cheal use, below that, you might see more HP healed for the mana
spent but its just going to be scary to use with that 10 second delay, and
trying to let the tank get hurt enough for full effect.

One thing to consider is using CHeal as a "between fights" heal, now you can
very accurately gauge whether you are getting more HP per mana spent with it or
your other best heal, and time isn't an issue.

Your "real MT" plan is something that works with any kind of healing, its
almost always better to pick the guy who takes the least damage from the mobs
and has the most HP, and have him take all the damage.  Only in a really tough
fight would it make sense to have the tanks take turns, and in that case the
idea is not to heal them, but use the couple thousand HP each drops as if it
were a heal in the bank; four tanks down 2000 hp each is 8000 hp of healing you
didn't have to do..... hmm, another angle on this is group heals, but its quite
tricky to get them up to full effectiveness, unless of course you are using
cleric Velious quest legs with the clicky 105 group heal.
