Because its not an English newsgroup is the short answer. People can post
in any language they so choose especially if there is no on topic
specific language newsgroup for them to use. English is merely the
language that will get them the largest body of readership and the highest
chance of a reply because its a language the majority of us posting here
can or do use...howver it may not be a language which the poster is
confident in using, or has mastered beyond, say basics of EQ
communication...or they have a very specific point or question they need
to raise and their mastery of English simply doesnt cover the nuances that
their native tongue makes trivial.
