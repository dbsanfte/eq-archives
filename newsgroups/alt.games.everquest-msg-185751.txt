Do you mean with the variable below in the eqclient.ini file?  I had to dig
around to find this, but apparently I had set that long ago when it first
came out and forgot about it.  So, I have already got the server filter on.

 ServerFilter=1
Description of ServerFilter from the Sony Library:

ServerFilter=[0-1] - 0=No, 1=Yes. If this line is set to 1, then Server side
filtering is occurring. Default is 0. If you are having problems with lag in
a raid situation, or when many other players are in the same general area in
Everquest, it is best to have this set to 1.


/serverfilter on
is not a valid game command BTW
