Now that's just lame.

I grant that the tutorial is worth doing; the FAQ even recommends it.
However, just glancing down the list of questions covered by the FAQ,
I have trouble identifying even ONE question that is "covered in the
tutorial".  The FAQ doesn't explain how to navigate, how basic combat
works, how to interact with various types of NPC (merchants, bankers,
quests), how tradeskills work, etc.  Yes, you should do the tutorial
if you need to learn any of that.  (You should do it anyway for the
Kobold Charm, unless you're being PLed immediately to a point where
you can get a better charm.)

Oh, and just to cap off how lame Fawnii's complaint is, it's
strikingly obvious that he/she has not actually read the FAQ, because
the FAQ actually INCLUDES an explanation of "plonk":

PLONK
   Please Leave Our Newsgroup - Killfiled; a claim that your
   posts will be ignored from now on

My thanks to Annie for sticking up for my taking on the public
service of maintaining (and posting) the FAQ.
