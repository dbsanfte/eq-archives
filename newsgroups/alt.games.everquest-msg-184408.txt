I got flamed in this newsgroup for suggesting that EQ actually helps *
prevent* suicide. :)

It would increase sales.

When I lost my job in the US (not my fault, company was downsizing), the 
time I should have spent cutting a new demo reel and shopping around for 
a new job went mostly into EQ. By the time I finally got around to it, 
my grace period had nearly expired, and I had to leave the country 
before I lost faction with the INS (this was in early '00, when my EQ 
addiction was at a peak). This led to me finding a job in a different 
industry, which I enjoy a lot more. It's funny, but EQ seems to have had 
an enormous influence in the direction my life has taken. :)

Same here, but for different reasons. I *do* have an addictive 
personality, so I cannot afford to drink, smoke or gamble, as I would 
probably end up abusing it.

The problem is that EQ is a lot better than real life in a number of 
ways, mainly that in spite of jerks and server crashes, your own 
development is in your hands. You have a degree of control over your EQ 
life you could only dream of in RL.

Girlfriends are the best reason to play a Gate-capable class. :)
