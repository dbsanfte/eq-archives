Fair enough, however, as I said, in EQ2, their primary goal is to make all 
priests, for example, heal equally effectively. In that scenario, there 
really isn't much need to play one priest sub-class over another, beyond 
your own particular tastes. What else does each offer that is really all 
that useful/desired that the other priest classes don't?

I'm all for a large number of different classes to play, but duplicating 
the primary role equally on several is a bad idea, IMO.
