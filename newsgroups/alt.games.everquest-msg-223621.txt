Well - that's tough to say because he's a bit different.  Our morning
PU raids run 12-20 people.  We can take him with no deaths with 18, we
can take BoT Ice boss with 13 and Wind with 17 and IV in AR with 17 -
to give you an idea.

He puts out a lot of damage fast (triples for 980 before mitigation) and
can only be slowed with a disease slow.  He has 2 companion gargoyles, 
apparently clerics.  They are unsplittable, mezzable, snareable, or 
rootable.

Our last kill (yesterday) had
4 mages
2 clerics
2 druids
1 ranger
1 shaman
3 warriors
1 wizard
1 SK
1 enchanter

and 2 others who escape me atm.

Now that I think on it, we weren't 18 - there were only 5 in my group.

We went with a an off-tank strategy.  Our weakes 2 tanks on the gargs
and our strongest on the Guardian.  The Garg tanks are healed by druids,
the gargs slowed by the enchanter.  First assist is the garg with the
weakest tank, then the 2nd garg then the Guardian.

The MT, 2 clerics and Shaman are responsible for keeping the Guardian
occupied - the shaman switches to healing the MT after he lands slow.

Our early attempts on him resulted in us killing 1 or 2 of the gargs 
before the MT dropped and the Guardian summoned and ate us - not the end
of the world because the dead gargs don't re-pop.  So, as long as you
drop a garg each time you make progress until you just have the Guardian
to kill.

He's VERY MR, but not so FR.  At 30% health he starts with this knockback/
shrapnel AE - no problems for casters at long range, you don't take much
damage (damage is by range), but a PITA for melee to stay on him.  Mages
work well here - fire hits and pets have no problem getting back on target.
DPS is the key at that point - knock him down quick.

My pets (I often take my 54 BL) survive with no healing and no buffs beyond
summoned gear with no problems.

Yesterday he finally dropped his FT2 int caster gloves - which I didn't
get, but the shoulders in my magelo are from him.

1 time in the 8 times we've killed him now we got regular garg adds from
the tunnel - not much of a problem.
