Found one in Velious in the Great Divid, near North zone boundary near
Thurg.  It was in the safe spot we were using to pull giants too.  I am
suspicious.  It seemed to be entirely too convenient of a location.
   Anyone find one in Kunark near either Firiona Vie or the Overthere
Outpost?

yesterday.  
           Felt it might be actually worth it when she saw the Thurg
pedestal.
