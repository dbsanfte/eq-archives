 Dwarves don't require as high of faction as giants/dragons. I've
started on the Rings myself and I am maxed KoS to dwarves. I also
mentioned that there are KoS people in my guild who have completed the
9th ring while being KoS. They used sneak so I'm guessing at least for
the ring quest that's good enough.

 I'm sure they do. But killing the big bosses gets you huge faction
adjustments.
