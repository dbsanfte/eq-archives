I once enabled texture caching and have since gotten more memory and
turned texture caching off.  My everquest folder remained the same
size.  I am experiencing short pauses and hard drive activity often.
Which files can I delete to get rid of all the stuff it cached so it
does not use the cached file anymore.   My drive is completely
defragged.

Thank you in advance!
