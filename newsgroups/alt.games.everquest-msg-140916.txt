And now we have DoT stacking on the test server as we speak.
I think we are going to see 6 necro teams like was see 6 wizard teams
now.

Think about it. 6 necros, all dots stacking, 6 pets. OMG /shudder X 10.
Think about them with 6 direcharmed undead pets. Wow.

I recently had my mage group with a necro and an enchanter.
OMG! I was pulling non-stop. I literally ran out of mobs to pull
after a while. hehe
