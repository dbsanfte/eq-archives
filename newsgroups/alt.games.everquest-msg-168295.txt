}In this case, no.  His exception contradicts your rule.

In 'exception proves the rule' cases, the exception generally does 
contradict the rule.  The point is that, in absence of other evidence that 
there is a rule, if you have to make an exception to it, that implies that 
the rule holds in all other cases.  For example, a sign saying 'No Parking 
4pm-6pm' suggests, by specifying a 4pm-6pm exception, that it is alright 
to park there at other times.
