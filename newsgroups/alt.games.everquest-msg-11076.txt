yes i play her all the time.  mostly RP than anything else now a days, since
my warrior feeds my disire to just kill things, and effectivly.

man, what i posted was a personal view point, nothing more..   And i will
dismiss my pallys spells.  At 22 the healing i can do to myself a little
cleric can do, and though it helps I spent a great deal of time healing
myself when i could just sit and bind wound which i do, and all that good
stuff. and as for my pally she is at level 23. much good root did on those
sarnaks...*grin*  and I still prefer my warrior.  plain and simple.  Could
care less about double attack on a pally when i got duel wield and double
attack on my warrior.

Don't get so defesive.  I said i didn't like my pally much compared to my
warrior.  And she is a high elf pally to.  should of made a dwarf.

*grin*
