um, so your saying if you have 340 K plat, your worth roughly $3,400 US?  I
find this hard to believe.  And even if it were so, most people who work
that hard to get the money in EQ wouldn't trade it for "real stuff".  I know
I spent way more time than it would of taken me to make $3,400 in real life.
It makes absolutely no sense to play EQ on an economic stand point.  Its
just a game for pete's sake.  and if you know pete, (which one friend comes
to mind), tell him hi.  : )  My bro was like why don't you just sell all
that valuable "plat" and do something more productive.  Even if it was worth
20 K US, I wouldn't sell it.  It took me way longer to develop the char in
the universe of everquest, and when he is buried, all his stuff is going
with him.  GL trying to rob his grave.  ROFL
Its against the policies to sell anything in RL in EQ, and breaking it could
easily get you suspended.  I'm sure you can bend the rules if your a nobody,
but my char isn't.  ROFL

okay, beyond a few of my bad jokes, another comment.  Had a huge sale with
someone else I knew who could move the merchandise I had bought big time off
of someone who should of known better when gambling with me in game and I
warned repeatly to just walk away.  Appearantly he thought I would just be a
nice guy like I had done so previously and he was in a win / win situation.
Eventually I realized I had to treat the gambling like business, and not be
so nice.  I tried to warn him that I wouldn't just be able to change the
rules on the fly just because he was losing so badly, but he disillusioned
himself ( my enchanter skills progressing beyond the game, perhaps? ) and
ended up losing alot of valuable equipment that was actually questionable on
how much he actually got it.  Appearantly he didn't mind causing trouble to
get nice equipment, like if someone dropped it or gave it to him to hold, he
would just keep it.  many who heard about it where happy he was basically
stripped of his stolen equipment.  I came close to giving him something back
like a big casino would do, like 10 percent of it, just so he would of built
up more again and come back, giving me even more profit.  But ethically him
leaving was probably better for him.  Hopefully he learned a lesson about
gambling.  Its better to be the house, than the gambler.  Anyhows, I
digress.  I had to sell off this equipment he gambled in my game, and
decided in this case I just wanted to dump it fast, so found another shaman
who would love this stuff and be reasonable about what it was worth.  Also I
needed someone with enough plat to actually be able to afford it.  doing
alot of time in EC, I knew just the person.  and while we were negotiating
(actually he decided he wanted all the stuff, I showed him what I had and he
wanted it all).  I gave him a good group discount, and negotiations on both
ends was very tough.  overall we both won, because he got items he could use
and sold off the rest and got a good deal overall, and I got rid of the
items faster than if I had sold them slowly, because it would of taken so
much time.  while we were talking, someone came along offering real money
for plat.  both of us weren't interested.  your going to have a hard time
just offering someone something for "reasonable rates" if they just don't
want to. My experiences in EQ have been priceless.



Kevin Smolnick - Ermin Sivarch - 57th enchanter on bristlebane.  died in
jail in the universe of Gemstone 3 due to evil cleric and evil GM.  might
eventually go back there and rezz himself to exact revenge against both of
them, as he had promised before.  ( necro skills, he had in that universe,
being slightly evil himself).
