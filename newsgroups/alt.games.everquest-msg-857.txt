>2.1    Q: What is Everquest?

>A: EverQuest is a real 3D massively multiplayer online RPG. Another equally
>accurate way of describing EverQuest is to call it a graphical MUD.

Made by Verant Interactive, a division of Sony Inc etc...
>3.1    Q: What is the best race/class combo to play

>A: To answer this question you have to ask yourself what is important to
>you. If you're familiar with other RPGs and games of this nature, you
>probably know that each character will have his or her strengths and
>weaknesses, and that no single class/race combo will give you all the good

>race/class combo is the best, but to ask which is best for YOU.  The best
>way to answer this question is to learn about all of the classes and races,
>and make your decision based on that knowledge.

Also note that Allakazam has an EXCELLENT page describing all the
classes.

>A: Destroy it immediately.  If you give this book to the Priest of

>3.4    Q: Well, what if I want to be a player killer?

Prolly best to call this PVP rather than PK

Opinion.  State that 'The general consensus is that..."


>A: No, sorry.  Verant does not allow this, partially to discourage from
>selling their characters using services such as eBay.

Alsos note that if you let a spouse or other relative start a
character on your account Verant will not EVER split that to a new,
paid account.  Ever.

>3.12    Q: How do I make a social?

Consider describing how to use /pause in detail, since Verant has this
somewhat backwards, pauses occur AFTER the next command sometimes.

....

Good start.  Consider adding info about Guilds, Planes (lvl 46 entry
requirement) Corpse Recovery Strategies, use of the /assist command in
groups, pet commands.  Will think of more.
