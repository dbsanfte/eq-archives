    Same with us, same with our competition. Fewer people online and overall
(our total numbers have shrunk by about one-eighth).

    We've lost two people to this, and could lose a third (submarine
engineer). Not big for us, anyways.

    I think this reduces how often people play rather than if they continue
to play. As I mentioned once during a flagging debate, my alts have all
risen quite a bit in level during PoP. And they only get played when I
cannot do anything else with the guild. PoP is a major shift - before, if
you were online X hours per week you progressed about as fast as anyone else
in the guild who was on X hours per week. Now, if you aren't on every day a
flag raid is done, you fall behind. And you never catch up.

    I just recently got my final HoH trial kill. Now I still need Mith Marr
to be on par with the guild and enter Sol Ro's Tower. But the guild has
already killed all the trials in Sol Ro's Tower, and wants to either kill
Sol Ro or kill Agnarr today and get flagged for the elemental planes. And
once they can go there, they won't want to kill Mith Marr again. So why was
I so late killing that trial? Because I missed the first two Aerin'Dar
raids, which flagged most of the guild for HoH. Missing those two raids is
also why I'm still missing some 63-64 spells, and why my alts aren't decked
out in finery bought with Girdles of Mithaniel and Windblades.

    We've lost two people recently to economic hardship. As a
family-oriented guild, we don't lose people often due to rising
requirements - they can afford to upgrade the computer if they can afford to
play EQ. It's the "if they can afford to play EQ" part that is the hang-up,
and given what the account of a raid-guild member is worth.... For example,
here's a tank from my guild that had financial difficulties, and was forced
to sell. He'd been forced to scale back his full-time status before we
really hit VT, too - he could have had much better gear had that not
happened:

http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=494803

  He sold for nearly $1000 US. When you're in difficulty, and your wife is
asking how you're going to put food on the table, tell me how you're going
to resist that.

    That's one of the big ones, for sure. One ranger in the guild flat out
said it was all the LFG he had to do. People don't like being "behind"
others, and with more levels and flags on top, you have exactly that.
