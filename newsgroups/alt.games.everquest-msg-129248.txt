Good info man. The only thing is that pets and experience were recently
overhauled. You get  75% maximum if you don't do any damage. If you do 1
point you get full exp. So things aren't as bad as all that. The only things
that doesn't work like that now is Dire-Charmed pets, which can take more
exp, but never more than 50%. But since we don't get than anyway, it's no
biggie.
