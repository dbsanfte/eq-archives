    Yup. At level 30, my enchanter can get about six vials off before
needing to med, and while maintaining only Clarity on herself can get out
about 4 vials every three minutes tops. So far, I've used 260 or so vials
getting tailoring up to 149 - so you can imagine how much time I spent just
medding, casting now and then, and reading.

    You get "lucky" once you hit 151. At that point, you need three swatches
per attempt and the swatches start to be the limiting factor. Even with my
WAR gathering swatches for me (either clearing the Heart Spiders while
soloing the AC in Upper Guk, or looting silks in the BR/SR in Lower when
grouped), they're still the limiting factor.
