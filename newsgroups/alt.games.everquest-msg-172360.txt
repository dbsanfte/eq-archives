Not only that, but he/she doesn't have one single character that would
justify spending 300 bucks (even those wall papering Canadian type
dollars) say nothing of more than that.

A 55 monk and a 58 BL with "epic"? (If they had primal or better you can
bet they'd mention it. These characters have likely never seen a raiding
guild.)

Please.

e-bayers are enough of a bane to the game. Stupidly unrealistic ones are
even worse.
