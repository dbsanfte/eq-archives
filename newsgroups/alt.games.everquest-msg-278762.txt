Coming into this thread a little late, but...

Your gear doesn't all of a sudden stop working when you go into 
a higher level zone.  Yes, some of your weapon procs might mitigate
or be resisted.  But for spells, some of those totally stop
working on mobs higher than level X.  Can't harmony/paci/mez, etc...
I'm guessing all your discs still function pretty much as they always
have.  But casting on a mob and seeing "your target is unaffected"
repeatly really bites, because that spell you have is now worthless
at that level.  For gear, you are still getting those stat and hp 
upgrades, and that sword you have will still do some damage.
