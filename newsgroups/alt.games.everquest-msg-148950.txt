Killing Qeynos guards will not get you positive faction in Neriak, or any
other evil city.

What you need to do is look up the factions on Illia's Beastiary (a
subsidiary of Allkhazam's website), and see there what sort of faction work
you can do. As a wonderfully evil Dark Elf Necromancer, I have convinced the
fools in Qeynos and Freeport that I am harmless. Only the casters with their
spells can penetrate the truth of my dark heart, and those annoying
do-do-gooders in the Temple of Marr in Freeport still desire my head. I did
the research, and figured out what I needed to do to get them to like me. It
is possible to be adored in Evil towns as well as Good. They still like me
in Grobb, Oggok and my hometown of Neriak. So you need not switch back and
forth.

If you want to be loved in Neriak, Invis is your friend, and so are several
stacks of red wine. There's a gent in the Neriak Library who would love to
share a drink with you. Most of your spells are also sold in Ak'Anon.... and
smellie humies and other lighties are welcome in there.

However, getting an alt or a friend, or promising to make a newbie very
rich, to buy for you are all viable alternatives.
