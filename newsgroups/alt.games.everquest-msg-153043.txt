Well, the Norrath explanation would be that you damaged the head so badly in
the fight that it was not useful for whatever it is that the heads are used
for.

Still, in real life terms, it does indeed suck, especially for things like
Phiney, where killing the mob generally involves a small raid for guild in
the low 50's.

I think we've got a Bard whose been at 30 Phiney kills, and no spine.

Besides being annoying in real life terms, it is annoying in game terms,
too.  When I'm on a quest to get item X from named mob Y, if I have to kill
Y 10 times, it takes away the specialness of the named mobs.
