I experienced this myself when I was thinking of a reroll and I went to 
test to see how the classes were at level 25.  It was fun making a druid 
and going wolfform and porting myself to Stonebrunt, but I realized very 
quickly that I had little clue about my spells or how to properly use them, 
and I died to a dark blue snow leopard.  Oops.

And I was just soloing in an empty zone, basically hurting nobody but 
myself.
