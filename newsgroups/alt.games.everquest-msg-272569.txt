And your point is ?

Fact eh ? Got any thing to back up that claim?

LMFAO... Illegal ?!?!?!?!?  I almost hesitate to ask but what statute is SOE 
breaking by denying service to some one that posted somthing they didnt like 
in a forum ? ( Heres a hint.. They arent. )

As far as EQ is concerned SOE  DOES have the final say. There is no law 
dictating that they must provide the service, and there are no laws 
dictating to them who they must provide that service to. All decisions are 
made by SOE.

Your ignorance really knows no bound doesnt it ? The EULA isnt law in any 
way at all. Its a contract that you willingly agree to every time you log 
into the game. A contract I might add that is subject to change at any time 
by SOE. You arent being coerced into agreeing to this contract.

So.. you fail on all 3 points.

Care to try again ?
