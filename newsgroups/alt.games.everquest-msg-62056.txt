It should be the same.. the only thing I heard verant say is they are
doing away with the 640x480 change view inventory thing altogether so
that now for the first time you will do everything in the same res you
are in instead of switching view at such times and having it shrink.

In case you don't know, part of the reason is probably to prevent alt
tabbing. You may have missed this but with some graphics cards and
drivers you could actually alt tab by switching "screen same size
view" to off and being at any res in EQ besides 640 x 480, at tabbing
so eq minimizes then clicking on eq on the desktop bar later, hitting
the eq change to other view function key (which will send you to 640 x
480, voila back in EQ.

So no more of that, even for people who can now.
