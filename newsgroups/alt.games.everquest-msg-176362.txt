Anyone else getting annoyed with the constant GM spam last night
advertising LoY? It started as a general advertisement to be followed
with an explanation (over and over) about the bug in the ordering
process on an hourly basis. Umm... We KNOW about the damn expansion
everytime we log in. Why do we have to get constant advertisements?
Whats next, a popup window with a obnoxious flash animation in the
middle of play?

I can see it now... you finally get that 96 rez and when you go to
click "Yes" i want to be rezzed, a multicolored in your face flashy ad
pops up for LoY. You grumble, close it, and 5 new ad windows pop up
all over the screen ranging from other SOE games to sony TV's and
electronics ads and "other" sponsors.

This is when i delete all my equipment/plat... log... delete all my
characters and press "unsubscribe" (notice i delete everything to
avoid the CIHYS's)
