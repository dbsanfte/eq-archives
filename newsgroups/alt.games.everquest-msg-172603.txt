Depends on how they do the math.  If they modify the modifiers (i.e. do
it as in your example) it is inferior.  But if they modify the the
result of the modifiers it would be 1.15 * 1.67 = 1.92 or 92% net haste,
which would be substantially superior.  It should be pretty easy to
tell the difference by testing it (easiest of all would be to have zero
haste on the subject and use Battlecry, which would give zero haste if
computed as in your example and 15% if it is additive or done as in my
example).
