Most merchants have a price guarantee policy that if a product goes on sale
within (typically) 30 days, you can go back and get the price difference. 
Check with the merchant you bought from.  Hope you kept your receipt.

That applies to local merchants (Best Buy, etc), but I couldn't tell you about
online shops like amazon.com, although they should be able to accomidate that
too.

When Velious came out last year, I bought it for $19.99 at EB.  The next week,
Best Buy had it on sale for $9.99.  I went back to EB and they gave me $10 back
painlessly.

And now for something else...

People crying lawsuits... what is this the 1980s?  :p  Honestly, if anyone
cries lawsuit without a logical backing for it, it makes the poster look less
intelligent.  Do some research first please.  When something happens, first
thing people think of is lawsuit first, logic later.

(No, Eddie, that is not aimed at you, but people in general.  I've seen lots of
lawsuit threats here lately.)
