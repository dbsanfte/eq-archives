Ten minutes?  TEN MINUTES?  OK, dude, as a soloing cleric before the 
existence of KEI and FT items, one who -wanted- the downtime so I could 
do household chores in between kills, I still had no more than 4 minutes 
between kills, more likely two minutes.

If you're taking 10 minutes, you A) have an outlandishly large mana pool 
and must have deliberately taken AAs and gear to raise that pool while 
eschewing FT or B) you're really going out of your way to hunt things 
that are inefficient for you.

B1) could be ignorance, you think that killing bigger mobs means more 
exp, which is true per kill but not necessarily per hour

B2) or it could be greed, you may be killing mobs that are technically 
inefficient, but which are dropping some kind of valuable loot.

B2a) however its likely that you'd be better off leveling up a bit more, 
or gearing up a bit better, before taking on those mobs, so you can 
clear them more efficiently.

B2ai) Sadly, taking this to its logical conclusion leads to people 
killing deeply green mobs for money making purposes

Lance

ps yes, you can now buy potions which give KEI like effects, and use 
tribute for FTlike effects.  And the situation is even more dramatically 
improved for soloing melee types, because their sitting hp regen rate is 
better and gets dramatically better as they continue to sit, and they 
can sit while bandaging, which works up to 70% or more, on top of using 
regen potions and regen tribute/devices... a melee can regen his HP in a 
way that rivals casters regening mana (while back in the day, you'd get 
to 50% and then give up)
