Don't think I did. 

Whenever I use allakhazam, or any site really, I make sure
 I click on popupstopper first:

www.panicware.com

I put for it to stop popups and for aggressive popup
control in the prefrerences. it is FREEWARE (no nags even, 
can turn off splash screen etc)

I think some of those need to pop up to put things on your computer.
I use zonealarm, adware and pop up stopper and pretty much have
nothing ever go wrong because something stops it.
