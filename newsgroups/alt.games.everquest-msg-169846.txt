Malachi 4:5-6 "Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming

As the conservatives shun govenrmental authority for the increase of
individual freedom.

He also insisted on no welfare payment to support Him.

More interesting, however, is your choice of words:  'your precious
"conservative movement".'  Could you please try to make your blind disdain
for conservatives a bit less apparent?  That way,  I could at least pretend
that I'm not arguing with a rabid partisan.  Really, between this, and your
insistance that I could not possibly disagree with you without being
Limbaugh's mind-numbed zombie, it's a wonder why you lower yourself to
debate with such a base form of life.  -_-

And I'll stand by my conviction that those who would forcably re-distribute
the wealth of others' (I never was sure, does "others" need to take an
apostrophy, or does "of" satisfy the possesive form???) are trampling the
free agency which was granted to us by God.  I won't go as far as comparing
them with the sons of Perdition, however.

You have yet to make a convincing case that Christ was talking about money,
and not pride.
