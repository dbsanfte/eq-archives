That's what ticks me off about expansions in MMORPGs.  Let's assume that EQ
is profitable, so that they have been making money off me for the 3.5 years
I've played.  Now consider a total newbie starting today.  They are willing
to let that newbie get in for whatever EQ Gold costs ($60)?  I, on the other
hand, have paid (approximately) $50 (original EQ) + 4 * $40 (RoK, SoV, SoL,
PoP) + $22 (LoY) for the same software.  That's $232.  Sure, I got 3.5 years
of play before Mr. Newbie bought EQ Gold...but that's what my monthly fee was
paying for.  The $232 is for the account itself and the software, which is
the same thing the newbie is getting for $60.

It seems to me there should be a point where they say "You've been playing
long enough and bought enough expansions that you've put enough up front
money in....from now on for you, it's just the monthly fee.  For any new
expansions, we'll only charge you enough to cover download costs, or CD
duplication/shipping costs".
