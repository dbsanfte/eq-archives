Oh excuse-me Berg, I did not understand you were just talking about 
paddings. Yes I know this recipe too but I still not use it. ;-)
But I do like making my own silk bandages in West Commonlands 
hunting spiders, quite useful for a chanter that is often wounded 
(at least to let the pet engage melee fight) and get no heal spell 
at all. As I have a very few HP, Binding Wounds allow me to survive  
much longer and not to beg some heal from a druid, cleric or other 
healing-able class player.

I DO know I won't solo for a long time yet, but as I like to make 
some solo I spend this sweet time to train the skills that will 
allow me to stay quite independent.
