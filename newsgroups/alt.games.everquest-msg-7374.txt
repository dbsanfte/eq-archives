    In Kunark, spells are in specific places. For example, Tunare's Request
(or whatever the 55 Charm Animal spell is) drops off of 'Shrooms, and
nowhere else. Note that this is only for the 55 plus spells - there's a
large number of places where the 51-54 quest spells drop.

    In Velious, this isn't as true. Certain low-level mobs can drop the
spells appropriate to their levels, and are the only such mobs. For example,
those two guardian wurms in Great Divide that drop spells. However, it seems
that all the high-level mobs have chances to drop spells, with certain mobs
dropping a specific number. For example, Lodizal drops four level 60 spells,
every time. I was like you at first - I heard Stun Command (55 CLR AoE stun)
dropped in PoG and I felt screwed, since I wanted to keep elf faction. Since
I've heard it drops all over the place. ;-)
