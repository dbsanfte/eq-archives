You say you're mid-level and your WIS is already 182?  What number were you
HOPING for by your level?  My 51 just hit 193 WIS...I think I didn't hit 182
until 45+.

But, in answer to your question the only thing I noticed that's easily
gotten all by yourself is a black alloy medallion to give you 2 more WIS.
Since I know nothing about buying gear I'll leave that to others.
