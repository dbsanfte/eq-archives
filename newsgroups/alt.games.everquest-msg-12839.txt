Oh, that's true about 1/2 of the time.  Most things need more than one dose.
Actually, I have better luck with mem blur when I mez 'em...even my new
level 8 enchanter on The Rathe.

And yes, charm usually (more than 50% of the time) breaks within about a
dozen seconds of casting it...so yes, you usually have to recharm or run.

LOL, if you think that charming stuff is the enchanter's class defining
ability you're going to be very disappointed when you start hitting the
dungeons.  Especially if you group with a wizard who believes that AE damage
is THEIR class defining ability (wizards who use AE don't get re-claritied).

Charming is a sideline...that's all it is.  It's not reliable to use and
should not EVER be counted on, even to gain you xp.  I mean, it's cool that
it worked for you in limited ways, but it's something you use to keep your
ass alive or to have fun impressing newbies or pulling jokes on people or
amuse people, pretty much like the vast majority of our illusions.   It's
not something you should base your character on.  You'll find that out
probably the 5th or 6th time charming gets you killed...I don't expect you
to believe me right now.  Hell, using a pet is probably better...at least it
doesn't take a lot of mana to cast, like Charm does.

True, an enchanter that plays on auto-pilot is useless.   Even above my
level of 52 there are enchanters that are useless except for buffs.  They
can't be counted on to do their class defining ability (that's crowd
control, btw, in case you were wondering).  A group can't be RUDE to their
enchanter (never be rude to an enchanter unless you're a necro and don't
need any buff from them) but if they could they'd tell these folks, "just
keep us claritied, sped up and sit your worthless ass over in the corner
until we call you again...root parking is preferable to you."
