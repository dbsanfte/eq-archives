And one other thing that I stress over and over again: You will almost always
earn brownie points (no, they are not redeemable in the Brownie Village in LFay)
if you ask IN CHARACTER for buffs like SoW, especially if the person you are
asking has a purple name (ie is either anonymous or roleplaying.) A few examples
that I have used myself:

/bow say bows low before %t.
Wise One, I will gladly donate to your order for the spirit of wolf.

/em looks down on %t with mild distaste and sighs.
Even a dark elf needs the spirit of wolf some times.
I won't demean myself by begging, I will pay.

And one I haven't used, but made me nearly die laughing when an ogre used this
(or something pretty close) on my barb shaman:

/em picks his butt and looks bashfully at %t.
Um, me trade you shiny tings for fast run. Please?

Needless to say, the ogre got SoW and every other buff I had available.

That depends on level. When my newbie alts first relocate, I *always* offer a
plat; with a bit of work you should have that much by the time you are on the
move anyway. The only time I've asked for a freebie was when I moved a 1st level
Erudite to Qeynos (I *HATE* Toxxulia as a newbie zone); a symathetic Erudite was
only too happy to help.

As far as what I expect, I expect more from a higher level character (or one
that looks higher level. Don't expect me to believe that someone wearing lambent
armor is broke!) Whether or not I will accept it... be nice to me and I will
return the favor.
