34 is the main lvl although i have read its possible from when ever it is
druids get first ae (4 i think but could be wrong) but have yet to see a
lvl4 druid quadding wasps lol.
but druids dont need to snare the mobs all at once if they are in a pack
just harmony first then pick them up one by one.
