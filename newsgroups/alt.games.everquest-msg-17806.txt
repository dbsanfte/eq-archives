Yeah, hope your level 16 mage thinks 'itz' cool to die repeatedly...
This is hardly the first time something like this has happened (granted
not on this scale, but there have been wars etc before). I remember when
my enchanter was 16, back before the Plane of Hate was opened on that
crazy Halloween, they had an army of Dark Elves invading the commons. I
ran in, watched some high level warrior attacking a dark elf. From max
distance, I cast Quickness on the warrior and started on my way. The mob
he was attacking *immediately* broke off from him, ran up to me and
killed me in like 2 hits. Yeah, those wars are a ton of fun for the
under 45+ crowd alright...
