At 22, with reasonable gear, your role is just about anything you want it to
be.  You can still tank (for about another ten levels or so), you can do
damage with songs, you can melee, you can buff the group, you can haste...
and you can do all of it at once if it pleases you.

Now, what SHOULD you do?

I'd encourage you to melee and tank as much as possible.  Get the dual-weild
and defense skillups while you can!  Soon the mobs will be too smacky for
you to do that with a bard's lesser defensive abilities.  Play with your
various songs, learn which ones you like, which ones work for you - every
bard has a different style.  Yes, everyone will harp on you for manasong,
and manasong is FINE for downtime.  It's a total waste during a fight,
though.  Experiment with damage shields if you don't have a slower; your DS
will stack with anyone else's and the damage it can cause is astounding.
Last night, my 52 bard was grouped with a 53 paladin and 55 mage; between th
e mage and I, the paladin was wearing 41 points of damage shield.  It was
like adding a monk to the group, without the complaints about autosplit
being on!  (/tease monks)

Most importantly, have FUN!  Bards are too much work to be played if you
don't love it!
