Not a flame, just a comment.

Back when they changed it so that coin could no longer be dropped, someone
mentioned to the devs that this would make money transfers more difficult
between characters on the same account.  The dev responded that something
that makes twinking more difficult isn't something the developers are going
to be too worried about.

So don't expect Sony to ever ever put any priority on stuff like this.  They
simply have no motivation to do stuff like you're suggesting.
