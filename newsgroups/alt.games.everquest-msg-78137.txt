Oh, I get it. Heck, I have difficulty getting to Shar Val myself, at 35 
(through getting lost in the Paludal Caves)... But getting to the moon 
itself isn't hard if you are near a porting spire. ;)

Erudites and Wood/High Elves have a Luclin spire pretty much on their 
backyards. Freeport-based humans, have it pretty hard, although for 
Qeynos humans it's a long, but not particularly dangerous run. Trolls and 
Ogres have a pretty dangerous, multi-zone run, and Dark Elves have it as 
bad as Freeport Humans (worse, in fact, because for them taking the boat 
to BB and porting from GFay is a no-no). Barbarians have a pretty long 
run, as well as having to run the Blackburrow gauntlet. Gnomes... Hm. Not 
too hard, if they survive the LFay crossing, but then again, LFay is 
almost equally deadly at lvl 1 as it is alt lvl 20.

Well, as long as the same applies to lowbie furballs in the Old World, 
fine with me =P
