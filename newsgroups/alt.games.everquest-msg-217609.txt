Yep. You're so right in everything you say here.

It really has. The old feeling of being in a world is mostly gone.

I hate instanced dungeons. If you don't want to play in a game with
hundreds or thousands of other people, then *don't play mmorpgs*. Very
tired of all the whining about the "other players" when the whole
point of the game is your interaction with them and how that
translates into what you do and what you accomplish.

As noted before, there is *zero* content in ldon. The dungeons are
very poor in comparison with any previous - almost completely linear
and devoid of character beyond what shows in the textures. Random
dungeons suck.

And EQ2 is full of the same crud as ldon. Its as if EQ was done with
ldon style dungeons from the beginning. :-(

Bring back the vision.
