Yep. I only pay 50 plat when people are doing it for donations, or I
offer to pay 50 plat for it in /ooc and someone always asks me to come
to them (in the nexus)

For my 38 sk troll, in okay gear but no HP regen or mana regen, its
fantastic for 50 plat. Its probably better than if I instead had a
fungal tunic. She goes to butcher and kills those 35 level dwarf
citizens that no one else does now, the always empty spawn by those
highly priced goblin camps (don't really understand those.. ahaha)

Being an sk she can do the first one then easily seperate the other
two with FD. At the end of a fight she may have used all of her mana
sometimes and be at about half health. A quick sit down and
lifetapping a nearby single goblin and the skells around the druid
ring and she is at full health. Then she meds up very fast due to the
C3.

In about 6 dwarves or less, the 50 plat I spent on C3 is paid for
from selling their axes and fine steel, runes, etc. to the nearby
beta neutral druid vendor using my 2 very cheap bazaar player made
charisma steins. So for me right now, this beats
luclin/velious/grouping or whatever. I'm surprised more people don't
do it since with POP I can go from the nexus to these dwarves pretty
darn fast (already have jboots so dont' even need an sow)

KEI for my sk is the same as if there was a spell greater than the
effect of a fungal tunic, that someone could cast on your warrior
which would last over two hours. My 45 hp lifetap and rapidly
regenerating mana via C3 make it so the downtime is very small.

So yes, 50 or even 100 plat will more than pay for itself. Its
fantastic.
