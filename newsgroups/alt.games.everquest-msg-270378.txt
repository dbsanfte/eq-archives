Here's another oddity; early on my download rate was about half my 
upload rate, but now the two are about even (sadly, because my upload 
rate slowed down to meet my download rate, not the reverse)

Now if I understand things right, the upload is me sending out to other 
users, while the download is me getting from other users.

Since I now have 93% of the packets, I'd think I'd have a lot more 
chance of having what any given user needs then back when I had 3% of 
the packets.

But instead of starting out with little upload and lots of download, and 
then gradually swapping places, it looks like the reverse happened, the 
more I have, the less people want of what I have.

I saw somewhere that throttling upload wouldn't work because sharing is 
on a peer to peer basis, so the less upload I allow, the less download 
I'm allowed.  That seems like a good idea to me, preventing freeloaders, 
but I can also see where I'd still want to throttle upload down a bit, 
if my total upload+download is fixed; throttling to 1/4th my total would 
mean I'd get matching dowload of only 1/4th, but if upload uses up 
3/4ths  my total then all the room I have left for download is also 
1/4th the total.  By throttling upload to 1/2 the total, I'd maximize my 
download speed to 1/2 the total.

If that analysis is correct, then it looks like my upload was at around 
2/3rds my total yesterday, so I only had room for 1/3rd.  And now this 
morning, I'm only uploading 1/3rd my total, so I'm limited to 1/3rd my 
total for download as well.  I'd go faster if only there was more demand?
