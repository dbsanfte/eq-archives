Thanks for the info... although I may be a little bit tired of Druids by 
now. I think that, if I do try WoW, I'll lean towards whichever class 
can more easily explore, through invis/illusions/whatever.

Still, in the case of EQ, I've always enjoyed the metagame more than the 
game, and somehow I doubt that whatever turns out to be the official WoW 
newsgroup will be as interesting as this one.
