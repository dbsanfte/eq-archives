Actually, I don't think bards have been nerfed that much, other than
the AE mez song.  The charm song change is offset by the fact that the
charm song now lasts for 18 seconds instead of 12, and it resisted
less.  I also don't think they ever raised the mana cost on the song,
instead the didn't lower it from 20mana to 5mana per use.  That sounds
cheap until you realized that I have about 800mana at level 56 and no
way to regen it any faster than natural regen, but bard mana has
alwasy been that messed up.  
I think the only real nerf I can remember was when they put level
limits on the bard charms.  Seems that some bard charmed Innoruuk on a
raid and had one hell of a pet.  Wish that had been me, no matter how
quickly I died, just to have Innoruuk call me master would be worth
it.
