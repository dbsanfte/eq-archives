No, it's been changed.  Now the only characters that have exp penalties are
iksar, troll, ogre, and a minor one for barbarians, and halflings have a
small bonus.  Comments such as yours below, and many other complaints, led
to Sony getting rid of class-based exp penalties, smoothing out the "hell
levels", and changing the way exp is divided in a group.  Feel free to
complain about iksar/troll/ogre warriors complete inability to solo
efficiently compared to a halfling druid, though, as there is still a rather
large gap there.  =)
