There is a recent group of them that started up on Brell. They were sniping
people trying to get to Capt Tillin to turn in gnoll teeth.

It presented a great dilema to me. I didn't know if I should take park my
magician pet outside and supprise them or dangle some bait in front of them.
After listening to their kewl dewd banter with victims for a minute I
decided they wouldn't take the bait on a magician double their level and
logged out.

I had a low level ranger in the area. Only ~level 10, at 50% health and
rabies. Exact type of challenge I knew these PvP gods were looking for.
Picked a non obvious spot that looked like it was in the PvP area and
started talking to an NPC.
"An imbecile tries to cast a spell on you but you are magically protected"
"You see an imbecile get punched for 300 damage!"
"You see an imbecile get punched for 300 damage!"

Didn't hear anything else after that. I left the area and logged out at the
bank since their witty conversation in /shout had dried up.

Still there, still not very useful.

No, just got to wait until someone in double digits does something stupid,
then systems normal.
