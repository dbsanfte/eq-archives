Daniel,

This should be RADEON compatible, whether or not its EQ compatible is
entirely up to the VI gods.  This card as I can tell by comparison of
features is nothing more than a RADEON 32MB DDR with built on hardward TV
tuner and capturing.   If you are having issues with EQ stating there are no
3D devices after upgrading to DirectX 8.1 (which I suggest you do IF you are
not running Windows 95) is reinstall the drivers for this card.   Please
note I'm by far a video card expert, just making helpful suggestions to
problems I had either experienced or heard of through trial and error. :)
