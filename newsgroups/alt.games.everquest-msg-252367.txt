I'd rather have a good group than solo, but, soloing the warrior is not 
bad at all now.  With a good group, I'm sure I could get more xp in the 
same time period, but, with a bad group, I could probably do better 
soloing.  Being as I don't know too many people to group with at my 
warriors level, I'd be stuck with pickup groups for the most part, so, 
when the few friends I have in that level range are not around, I solo.
