Nah, I kept an eye on the buyers for awhile to see who they were and 
what they were selling.  I try and set a healthy balance between 
"cheaper than everybody else to give people a break, but not so cheap 
that others are tempted to buy up all of mine and sell it at their 
price."

Well, except the mephit meat thing.  I saw *one* guy selling it, for 
100pp each, so I marked mine at 50pp each, and joked in the tradeskill 
channel that if I was lucky, he'd buy me out.  Somebody else came along 
and bought the entire stack.  I still dunno if it's actually valuable, 
or the buyer was completely mad.  Not that I'm complaining, mind you.  
It probably cost me somewhere between 9 silver to 1 plat per piece 
during a vendor dive. ;p
