No Quest (other than getting to Twilight Seas and having a PC that can
handle the zone)
Drops off of Groaning Shadow in Twilight seas.

Mid 30's mob
Classed as undead but not all shadows see invis.
Is not no drop, is lore.
off the top of my head is 23/44 +5str and wis +40 mana 2hb. Usable by all
the normal 2hb classes (no int casters) except Paladins.

The shadows proc spirit tap, 150 pnt life tap, not many people hunt them due
to this (more work than is worth the effort)
Other Named
Dark Shadow (drops Darkedged Dirk 6/23 +3 str int and 10mana range as well
as melee)
Lithe Shadow (Drops Blackened Mace 7/24 +3wis/str +10mana/health 1hb)
Frenzied Shadow (Drops Darkedged Twohander 23/40 +6 str/int +20 mana 2hs)

There are others.
Malicious, Sinister to name a couple who drop items for Twilight armour
quests.

All the named shadows can also drop Twilight Cloth items which are nice for
int casters (Cloak, cord, veil and shroud all I know of and allakhazams
seems to have a problem so can't check)

Sells for about 300pp, maybe less. The groaning shadow is pretty common.
