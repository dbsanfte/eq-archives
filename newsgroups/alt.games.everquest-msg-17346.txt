The part i find annoying is when they don't understand "no".  I was going to
go into MM with a friend and just kill some inkies with my pally, well this
27 level pally ( i am 22) sends me an invite to his group along with a tell.
I inform him that i am grouped already and just here to get a little exp
without dieing.  He sends me another tell, informing of his group dynamics
and say, "just leave your partner I need to hit level 28".  Well warning
lights went off with that comment and i refused again a few more invites
that kept finding thier way to me.  My partner was considering joining in
with them, but we held off and when we say the trains they were causing and
the death toll we were rather glad to hold off on the "invite".

Though i still got an invite again.
