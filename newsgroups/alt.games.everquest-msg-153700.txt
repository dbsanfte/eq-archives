Which would be fine if they were the only ones playing the game
or if there was a infinite supply of all mobs at all times.
But there are other people that play the game to ya know. When
a manaburn team of wizards that can teleport quickly around the
world after a patch and kill several mobs in quick succession and
time lock them down, sorry that's just plain wrong. Especially when
those mobs don't respawn for others to kill for days or a week.
