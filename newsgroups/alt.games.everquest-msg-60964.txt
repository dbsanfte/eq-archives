You can't train to more than your current maximum skill level (obviously).
Also, you can't train above 165 (might have been 160, been a while) at a
trainer regardless of your level - you get a message saying you are more
skilled than they are :).

I think the L16 spells trivial at 20 skill. I'm not sure what the
progression is, but the L44 spells are trivial at 168 skill, the L49 ones
aren't. Might be (L-12) * 5, but that's just an educated guess.
