So? They screwed up and fixed stuff. /shrug. Happens every day
all over the world. You never screw up at your job?

Many of the fixes occurred because the players used the
items/spells/abilities different than what they were intended for.

CoH is for getting people to a raid because they showed up late
due to RL commitments. A nice handy feature that lets people have
a life. Not to call in the whole raid to the end boss and bypass
the whole dungeon.

Summon corpse is for getting your body back from a nasty wipe
out in a deep dungeon, to avoid a second raid to get your stuff
back. Also, not for bypassing a whole dungeon.

Rubicite was just short sightedness on Verant's part. They
had no idea this game was going to be this popular, or
this crowded.

Ok the mana burn thing was a little obvious how that could be
abused. However, if the wizards that had it just had a little self
control they would have avoided the nerf bat. Tough shit they
brought that on themselves.

And again the corpse looting/locking was done because of
bad players. Also, the coin drop thing, done because of player
scams.

I am sure a lot more of this will happen. PoP will bring even more
'mistakes.' Even games like DAoC, UO, AO have been hit with
the nerf bat, and I am sure future MMOGs will not be immune either.
It goes with the territory.

The only thing you can fault Verant for is the time they take to
fix things. A lot of shit stays broken for a long time before they
get to it.
