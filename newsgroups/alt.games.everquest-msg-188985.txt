Hmmm... in UT2003 with ansiotropic and AA: 100% over GF4 4200.
http://www.anandtech.com/video/showdoc.html?i=1756&p=9

Other comparisons from other games available in that review also.

Their conclusion (note this review is from November '02 also,
meaning that ATI/Nvidia has revised their drivers for extra
speed since then):

"ATI is very concerned about making sure the Radeon 9500 Pro
is a success, as it targets a much larger volume price point.
Thanks to an improved driver, new board design with an optimized
layout and a full 128MB of memory the card is able to compete
with the GeForce4 Ti 4600 instead of being just barely faster
than the Ti 4200. "

Note the 4600 vs. 4200 portion...

As you mentioned, from pricewatch.com for 128Mb cards:

ATI Radeon 9500 Pro from allstarshop.com (shipped): $175
GF4 Ti4200 (cheapest - "Eagle" brand - who's heard of
that???): $123.25 shipped.

Don't know where you're getting your "under 100" figure from,
but I can only guess that you're looking at no-name 64Mb
cards.

For the extra performance and a real brand, I'll take the
9500 Pro.  I'm not an ATI fanboy -- I don't even currently
own any Radeons, but face reality - ATI holds the performance
crown at that price level and higher.
