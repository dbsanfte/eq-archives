Morning Final
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

He cast a grim shadow
Through the busy street
Said he was a junkie
And he punctuated his walk with a gun

Motiveless murder
The papers scream
The cops all said
The crowd was iced by the sight

Oh baby don't it make you feel so bad
Dark clouds are over the street
After what I read, I can hardly feel my heart...
My heart beat

Down the subway stairs
After him they leapt
An echo snap and scream of fire
The hot pursuit was done

For the last time he felt the light
And gave up his last fight

Oh baby don't it make you feel so bad
Dark clouds are over the street
After what I read, I can hardly feel my heart...
My heart beat
