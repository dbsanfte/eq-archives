My level 15 troll use a FBSS and a Glowing Black Sword and a Yak for 1hs, and
Fellhammer for 2hs.
I can see a difference from before i got FBSS, and wouldn trade it for a TTB.
(of course i have 188 str), but even if i only had the starting str i would not
trade it, i deal out a good bit more damage with FBSS, and will evne more after
20, where the BEEP damage cap are removed *s*
