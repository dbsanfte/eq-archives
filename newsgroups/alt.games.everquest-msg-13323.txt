Part of the problem is that these idiots have no idea what the
difference is between root and snare, other than the speed (or lack
thereof) effects. Not only does Snare slow/stop the MOB but, as opposed
to root, when a MOB is snared, it WILL NOT attack you unless you have
just all of a sudden moved to the top of it's hate list and it's not so
low on health that it automatically runs. The only time that this has
really happened to me was when my Warrior was hunting with his Druid
buddy and we were fighting bandits. He nuked and snared, Mob started
running, I started hacking away and taunting and it turned to face me,
giving me one of those, "I'll teach you to interfere with me, Soandso!"
messages. That's really the only time, though, that a snared MOB will
turn and fight. Glad you were able to take them on nevertheless. Just
keep that in mind if you're ever playing with a caster who can snare.
