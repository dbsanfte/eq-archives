Setup:

44 Enchanter
39 Druid (two-boxed by the enchanter, me)
41 Monk (likes to socialize more than pull so I pull with the enchanter a 
lot)

I think I have about 100k invested between the 3, with the monk and 
enchanter getting most of that, to give an idea of the level of gear we're 
in.

Suggested so far:
Dreadlands - XP didn't suck too bad, but it certainly wasn't going as fast 
as I'd like.
Lower Guk - I don't know much about this zone.  Which camps could/should I 
look at?

Also tried gunthak, and it was alright when I had a charmed and hasted 
drogmor tearing through the caves.  Fighting in the fort was okay too, but 
the monkie was complaining (then again, she's complained since paludal).

Anybody have any other zones/camps that yield some nice xp around this 
level and for a group with this composition?

Thanks in advance,
