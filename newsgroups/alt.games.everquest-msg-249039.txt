I did not mean to imply or insinuate that you copied.  I was merely
asking for a definition in-your-own-words as opposed to a copy from
dictionary.  Further, I have nothing against reliance on dictionary
definition as long as it is accompanied by personal understanding (the
in-your-own-words part).  I apologize if my meaning was not clear.

Now here is some meat.  I accept your definition that an insinuation
is a hidden accusation.  However I maintain that a hidden accusation
is still an accusation, just as a red car is still a car.
So:
if an insinuation is a hidden accusation
and a hidden accusation is an accusation
then an insinuation is an accusation.  QED
