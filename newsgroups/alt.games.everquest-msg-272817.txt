Or they might use the mechanism they already have, and say that
if 85% of the raid is in guild X, then the other 15% can enter
the otherwise-restricted "guild hall for guild X" as well.

Although we can all point to examples of good ideas done poorly
in the past, I am willing to wait and see how they handled this
one.  (Though I admit I'll be surprised if anyone can enter a
guild hall without having bought the expansion.)

At least it sounds as though this expansion might have enough to
entice me into buying it.  I still haven't bothered buying OOW,
since my highest character is 51 and I have plenty of things to do
without the OOW "Tasks".
