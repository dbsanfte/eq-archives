    You want a really, really messed up charm bug introduced in the patch?
Guild is doing Fennin Ro. Necromancer casts Wake The Dead on the dead tash
enchanter. The Wake The Dead pet enchanter CHARMS FENNIN RO. After a few
ticks of "WTF?" and "ROFL", Fennin breaks charm, goes nuts because his hate
list order wasn't preset (he broke charm in camp), and kills everyone.
