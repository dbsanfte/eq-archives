Never ceases to amaze me at all the whining going on when EQ gets patched.
Take a minute to think about people like myself who live in countries on the
other side of the world (Australia in my case) that get this during our
prime playing time. At least most patches are during your downtime.

You really do need to take a step back and say hey, at least they're TRYING
to minimise the impact for us. Either that or quit complaining that this is
buggered or that needs to be nerfed or that needs to be changed. Play the
game as it is and it won't get patched. If you want a "better" game, then
live with the consequences.

By the time this is finished and taking into account work obligations and
everything else, it'll be two FULL days before I can play again.

So to all those that think they're world is over 'cause they can't PL their
latest twinkie, lighten up, get a life and make some RL friends, you never
know, you may actually like it. ;)

Sorry for the vent... at least I feel better now. ;)

Flames expected but not necessary...
