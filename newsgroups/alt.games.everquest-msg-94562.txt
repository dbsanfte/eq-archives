If it "tanks" someone else will come up with something similar. Or
several people will take on niche parts of the failed site which is a
much more sound model (like one item site and one quest site)

I'd only pay for it if they paid me and the other people who submit
the info to the site such as screenshots of items. Otherwise you have
a pay for site which is nearly totally updated by users for free,
something just seems wrong with that. Its the users sending in the new
items and quests which make the site work.

It ceased being a community site and became instead a commercial site
the moment they offered a pay for value utility outside of what the
normal users can enjoy. If it is a commercial site it follows that I
have no responsibility as far as it continuing to exist.
