My typical spell lineup:

1. Heal
2. Jolt
3. Eagle Eye
4. Nuke
5. Nuke
6. Varies*
7. Root
8. Tangling Weeds

Entrap and innate camo are hotkeyed

For 6, I will put a disease cure if I expect to need to cure a slow,
Burst of Fire for breaking roots on me and mobs, Camo if I will need
to invis people, Regeneration if soloing or grouped with a necro and
no one else can regen, Flame Lick if tanking and having trouble with
aggro, SoE if nothing else.

Since 4 and 5 really make no difference in DPS, they are just kinda
fun with critical nukes, I have 2 more spell slots available to fill
with regen, cures, SoE, Camo, Flame Lick, Bind Sight, whatever.

Now I can understand if you don't have entrap, that you will need to
add that to this lineup.  (I recommend getting it BTW, great for
saving a spell slot).  But before I had it, I still always kept jolt
up, no problem.  The only way I can think that you could not keep it
up is if you permanently kept group buffs up (they last an hour or
more each) or found that nuking for 600 or 700 damage was more
important.
