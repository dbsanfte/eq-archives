 Calefaction isn't the only nuke Druids get. Starfire. Scoriae.
Moonfire. I don't remember exact numbers but I'm pretty sure they do
more damage and have a quicker recast than Calefaction. Of course I
think Clerics get better nukes as well so I don't know if you were just
listing <50 or what.

 Free damage never gets outdated. Sure, you wont be using them on most
raid encounters but for everyday use they are just fine.

 Forage > Summon. I haven't summoned food since level 10 or whatever it
was.

 I believe so. Limited to what zones it can be used in though.

 That the summoned version? There's always Quillmane...

>Rezzes... even Pallies can Rez, Druids can't

 I'll give you that one.

>Stuns... Druids don't get any

 Uh. Yes they do. Not as good as clerics but there are some that work
even indoors.

 Then why are they always whining for ports?

>Snare?... doh, Crystaline Silk Net

 LOL.

>Wolfform?... only if you want to be KoS in almost every zone released since

 The only reason I go wolfform is for the increased mana regen.
Otherwise I'm happy enough with regular form.
