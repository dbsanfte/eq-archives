Thanks for the response.  My PC is a Pentium III 1Ghz.  The EQ trilogy
was running fine on my pc, then I installed Luclin and ran into all
kinds of video lag.  I upgraded my video drivers to the latest from
Nvidia, fixed the lag, but now I'm having all kinds of flacky startup
problems with the OS, and as I try different back level drivers for
the TNT2 pro, the problems vary.....so rather than mess with this
anymore, I thought it might be time to upgrade.  Think I'll stop by
Best Buy on the way home and have a look.   From yours, and others
advise, sounds like the Geforce 3 might be a good choice for me,
whether a Ti200 or Ti500 will depend on the dif in cost.  Sounds like
either would be preferable over what I currently have.  Thanks again!
