Apart from the vendoring system, everything so far is very good. However,
that's a big issue. cf
http://eqiiforums.station.sony.com/eq2/board/message?board.id=Newbie&message.id=1427

 Also, I'm not too keen on the fact that they have lots of extra features
available to you if you pay more money. I'm not quite sure if they'll grant
a certain amount of xp per dollar as some people have suggested but it
worries me. Not letting you take screenshots unless you pay extra is just
weird. Maybe that'll change.

It all reminds me of SWG. SWG had a better vendoring system and the crafting
was more relaxed, but it was a bummer to come back from holidays and find
your house and possessions had rotted away, and i hear your vendor npc's
could be murdered by players, although i never saw that. I didn't like the
way tough npc's used to spawn right next to player housing. It didn't make
any sense and was downright dangerous if you focused on crafting. I like
crafting but so far it doesn't seem important in EQ2. Perhaps I will feel
differently if i find out my iksar monk can make some decent monk robes or
weapons.

Unlike EQ1, where crafting was heavily weighted to the casters, which again,
made no sense. Smiths, tailors, chefs, and so on do not need to be brilliant
in academic matters, or aware of the number of angels found dancing on the
average pin; they need to be hardworking and creative, and a monk, rogue,
warrior type should have the same opportunities in crafting as the caster
types.

It's fun playing and having things not quite make sense. I confess to
missing the eq1 death-port (even low level chars have a death penalty, not
much so far) and being able to twink myself out, and am worried about item
wear and tear, but as a newbie in this, i've fought a huge variety of mobs,
that have been separated nicely and not mixed up (no griiffin in the orc
camp, or hill giant in the orc camp for that matter like the old
commonlands).

I'm also perplexed that there are 2 moons visible. I thought there was only
luclin and that had been wrecked? One of them seems just like ours except
nearer.

Anyway, it's my first day with this game and i hope this feeling of general
satisfaction remains with me.
