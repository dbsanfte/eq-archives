They turned in thier book to the Priest of Discord, and became PVP flagged.

It's generally not a good idea on a non-PVP server.  If thats what he's
looking for he should try one of the Zeks.

Some GM events also require that the (newly created) characters become PVP
flagged, since that will prevent any normal character from buffing them or
healing them, or otherwise helping them win whatever event it is in an
unfair way.
