I was thinking of something a little more, um, roguely.  Like the community
agreeing that "Lurking" would be the term ascribed to the combo :)  I like
the term "cloaked", since it has a nice feel, but I'd prefer the feel of
something that's more of a verb by itself.

"I cloaked up and moved through to the depths of MM"
"I lurked my way down to the Hand room."

Hmmm....   other ideas?
