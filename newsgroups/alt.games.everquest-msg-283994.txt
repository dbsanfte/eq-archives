	I think it depends on how you FD.  When you fall down
make sure you put all four feet up in the air, like a roadkilled
possum, and add a convincing death rattle.

	In my experience, I can load up the dots until I *do*
draw aggro then just FD to give it back to the tank so I can get
on with twitching the cleric...  The one trick might be that you 
*do* have to stay down for a bit and not bounce right back up.  It 
might be as simple as waiting until the rest of the group catches 
up to your damage.
