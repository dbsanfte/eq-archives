I had to turn down an invite to a Naggy raid last night because I knew my 
resists were too low ( MR 67(?), FR 27 ).  After I get a few more levels, I 
will be going on Fear raids, and need to get whatever resists are needed 
there up, too.

What resist gear do you recommend for a 45 Warrior or a 51 Ranger to 
purchase?  The Warrior is mine, and I only have about 6k banked between all 
my characters.  I'd rather not spend it all, but I will if I have to.  I 
have an Enchanter who is maxxed in Jewelry skill and will attempt any 
jewelry for me for free.

Our group is going to start hunting for resist stuff soon.  Group is 
something like this: 45 War, 45 Monk, 47 Shm, 50 War, 51 CLC, 52 Brd.  Any 
suggestions on what resist crap we can hunt would be great, too.
