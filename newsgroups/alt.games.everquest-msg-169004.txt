I saw a similar thing just the other night on Test when we took our
lowbies into the Warrens.  I was tanking so I'd Taunt and Assist to
check whether Taunt worked.  A few times, after Taunt failed more
than once I'd get sick of waiting and attack the mob anyways (most
of the crew had Aego and Brell's, I joked that they only let me tank
out of sympathy since they had 2k hp vs. my 380 or so) and each time
the mezzed mob went for me even though it still had the Enchanter
targetted while it was mezzed.  Also, at least twice mez wore off
before I attacked, and those mobs also attacked me.

My theory is that the mob checks for agro when mez breaks, but does
not check while mezzed.  So the mob's target does not change while
it is mezzed unless it is MemBlurred/Atoned (loses target) or Taunt
works.  This means (if I'm right) that the mob's target while mezzed
is not necessarily the PC at the top of the hate list and it can
change the moment mez drops.  Those kobolds in the Warrens have
noticeable proximity agro, which would explain the two that switched
to me when mez wore off even tho Taunt had not worked.  And your
result above is explained if the hate from being mezzed is not
considered in an agro check by the mob until mez breaks.  Those JP
gnolls have very little proximity agro, you can pull them past other
folks pretty darned easily, so have your Ranger resnare after you
mez or something to make sure somebody else is at the top of the hate
list (or have somebody else Taunt, or memblur, or ...) just don't
trust the target to represent the top of the Hate list unless it is
you or it has changed.

Kaev <--- who recommends you get a Paladin with a one-hander plus shield
into your group to make sure no gnoll caster gets off anything slower
than Root, it's one of the few things Paladins actually shine at.
