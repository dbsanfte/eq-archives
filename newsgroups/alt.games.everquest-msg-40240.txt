News bulletin, Einstein -- in this age of the internet, many
computer games are available via an online download (some
free, some after entering your credit card information to
purchase it).

Clive was clearly asking whether Everquest was obtainable
this way, and if so, where.

Even if it *had* been a stupid question (and it was not),
it was an inoffensive one, and thus your belligerent tone
was completely uncalled for.

I have a lot more tolerance for the truly ignorant than I
do for those who take a bullying glee in a cheap excuse
to spew their hostility.
