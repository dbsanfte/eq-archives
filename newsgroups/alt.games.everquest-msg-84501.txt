We got the shaft when it comes  to quests.

But if you worship Tunare, check out the Initiate/Disciple/Warden Symbol of
Tunare quest line.  Final quest result gives you a necklace with FREE CLICKS
OF ROOT!  Check out the first quest at
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1252 , the rest of them
link off that page.

If you don't worship Tunare, um. woot for you.

Oh, and you can start on doing bits and pieces of your epic, such as the
forages, the platinum speckled powder and the ancient pattern, as well as
the corrupted mammoth, and while you could do the bit with running back and
forth to Burning woods, I'd recommend waiting til 39 when you get your
Skyfire port, makes that bit a WHOLE lot easier.
