I disagree, the de prefix (which is not capitalized) means "of" or "from", and is
an accepted, legitimate prefix, as is le, which means "the". For a first name, it
is stretching acceptability, but surnames came about by associating jobs, places of
residence, etc. with personal (first) names. For example: Jack the Smith, Jack the
White, and Jack of Burleigh would become Jack Smith, Jacques LeBlanc, and Jack
DeBurleigh. Who is to say that a different world would not use such prefixes on
first names? Or that the positioning of personal and family names wouldn't be
reversed, as they are in japan and other countries here on this world?
