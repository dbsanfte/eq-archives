Barely even noticeably, though.

With the recent "fixes", nightblind races aren't as bad off. Even
without a light source in the dark, I can navigate well enough.

Hunt the gnoll guards just outside BB on the Halas side. No clue why
you put a 12 min on tundra, I was doing great out there at 8. Also run
the other quests in the Halas/Qeynos area for more xp, as mentioned.

I rarely hunt BB, anyway. The plains are better, really.

You kidding? Innothule and Feerrott are possibly the worst newbie
zones out there as far as I can tell. A pain to navigate unless you
stick to paths/walls

And I very strongly disagree. Iksar, Ogres, and Trolls all have a
nasty KOS issue, which, IMO, far outweighs the disadvantages
Barbarians have. Ogres and trolls have horrid newbie zones in my
experiences.
