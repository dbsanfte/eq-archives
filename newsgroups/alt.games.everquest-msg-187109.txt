Is this what you've currently decided to use as your spin? Do you
remember what I said in the first place? I marvelled at the idea of DL
having a POSITIVE exp modifier in the mistaken belief it had one.

Get your head out of your ass. I wasn't claiming any knowledge I
didn't have anywhere at all. I knew a zone experience modifier was
something that made mobs give more experience, and that's all I ever
claimed. At no time did I claim I knew the formula, nor can any of my
comments be taken that way unless one is deliberately being an ASSHOLE
over it. That's you, punk.

Frankly, since you were NOT the one I was talking to before, and it
has been explained to you that I was NOT dissing Ben Haddick, you can
take your unprovoked, unnecessary, and pointless sanctimonous blather
and shove it up your ass.

Bullshit. I always knew what it meant for EQ. I didn't know the math
formula for it.

How long have I been on this newsgroup? How many posts have I seen
asking about zone experience modifiers? Give your head a shake,
something inside it isn't working.


> You thought you knew, but you were
>*wrong*

No, I *asked*, and jumped to the wrong conclusion. Look again. And
again, and again, however many times it takes for you to get it and
get off my ass for your own mistake.

Which it was, and has been admitted to have been.


> In the above quote, you continue to try and defend your ignorance.

Defend my ignorance? Are you senile? Since I was asking a question
from the very start, my ignorance was a GIVEN! Not of what a ZEM was,
but what the formula was! 


>Note how you draw attention to how the OP's response included a "math

Because (besides the precise numbers) the math formula was the only
thing I didn't know? Duh.


> Well, it matters if the point of your response is to belittle
>the form of his.

So you have nominated yourself the guardian of all things good and
pure in age?

Congratulations. I'm sure Ben Haddick really needed the help defending
himself when the person doing the defending appears to have a problem
with common Enlgish and refuses to admit when he was wrong even when
it's pointed out to him.


> Your second sentence, "Not everyone...", continues to
>belittle the form of his response to you.

The fact that not everyone chooses to get into the grit of the machine
and know the precise numbers for everything is undeniable fact. That
doesn't mean this person doesn't know when there are changes to those
numbers.

And at no time was I belittling anyone. What part of that don't you
get?

I never attacked it at all. I pointed out that I didn't so it was
unreasonable to call someone a "fool" because they didn't.


> Attacking the form of the response,
>and not the points it makes, is attacking the poster.

Take your own advice, hypocrite.
