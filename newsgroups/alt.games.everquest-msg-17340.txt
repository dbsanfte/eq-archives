}Come on, did you read the original post? It�s so farfetched that the author
}must be
}a) A troll. Don�t answer trolls, except to point out their trollness.
}or b) A fool. Same as for trolls.

Personally, I think answering a troll or fool to point out that quality to 
them is about the only reason you _shouldn't_ follow up, because it's a 
bloody waste.  If it's a true troll/fool, 95% of the group's readership 
knows that from the original post.  On the other hand, following up to 
make fun of the troll in a generally entertaining manner may be 
worthwhile.  But then it's a good idea to take other newsgroups out of the 
header, unless you know how your sense of humor plays in their groups...

}or c) Someone out to discredit SPLC and anti-hate movement in general. Don�t
}give them the satisfaction of an answer.

Ain't giving them nothing.  Note: they crossposted.  They posted the same 
thing multiple times.  They're probably using spamming/autoposting 
software (badly).  They probably never read any of the groups they're 
posting to. 

}or d) Someone with a weird sense of humor. Same as c.

Then what am I supposed to do with _my_ weird sense of humor?

}Also, it�s not only off-topic, it�s way off-topic. That is enough reason not
}to answer, except to try to put an end to the thread.

Good luck!
