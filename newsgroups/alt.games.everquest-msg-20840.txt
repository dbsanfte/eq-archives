Ahhhhhh darn.  And here I was hoping I *wouldn't* have to keep switching 
slots. Even the 3 second mem time annoys me :)

Hah!  I can deal with that.  It's when I've got 3 mobs on me and a group 
member is going "Sow plz." *3 seconds* "SOW plz!" that I scream (and cast 
drowsy >:) )

This is another thing that gets me. I have no idea how you people keep 
EVERYTHING straight.  Who gets what spells, what spells overwrite each 
other, which stack, who's going to be very pissed if I cast such and such 
on them...

Bwa ha ha.  Been there done that.  Had a guy spamming gibberish in the 
middle of battles (he explained that this was because he was 'going LD'.  
Oh good, so you're dragging the rest of us with you. THANKS!) AND 
screaming "GETITOFFMEhealmeGETITOFFMEhealmeGETITOFFme
GODDAMMITISAIDHEALMEWHEREAREYOUPEOPLEWHENINEEDYOU?"  It was that last bit 
that got me and the other healer (can't remember her class but both our 
heal spells were so weak as to require us to use basically all our mana 
if we wanted to heal anything) and basically, we both said nothing, and 
just stopped healing.  I also stopped casting SoW.  So yes, I've figured 
out that trick. :)

Heh. Have tried this.  Basically, with a group of six, SoW no longer 
drains me, but turtle skin does.  Should I use resist cold AND resist 
heat AND resist disease AND resist poison when we're fighting caster 
classes?  I can see where it would help, but that's a lot of time and 
mana casting on six people (plus one or two pets sometimes).

Have you noticed that?  I think someone's watching us through orcish 
eyes.  And I ALSO question how much mana the typical mob caster has.  
Long after SIX of us are oom, s/he's still casting.  Bastards... *jealous 
mutter*
