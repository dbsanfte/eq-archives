The Warrior Class is both balanced and broken.
In the grand scheme of things, it's fine, nothing wrong...after 55 there is
no better damage sponge, the Warrior's place on a raid, albeit in limited
quantity, is firmly taken.
In the lesser, RPG, fantasy realm the class is, to coin the phrase, Gimp. No
one that creates a Warrior as one of their initial characters thinks "I
know, I'll make a damage sponge class, someone that is good at sucking up
punishment and nothing else" No, they make the class believing it is a no
compromise fighting machine, sacraficing versatility to be the ultimate
master of all things melee. Unfortunately that is but a pipe dream and you
soon find that classes with versatility, ones that can heal themselves,
scare, snare, dot, feign death can also outdamage you in melee...
If the armour a Warrior (or Knight) wore actually protected them properly
then maybe this lack of damage output would be easier to swallow but
unfortunately this really can never be, if the Warrior could solo due to not
taking the damage then the Mobs would have to be made tougher for raids and
even groups and so then again we have a Warrior who can't solo

The Warrior class is not broken, it's just a one trick horse that is only
suited to groups in a limited quantity...I think all classes were meant to
be like this, it just doesn't work out that way.

Anyway, you get Defensive at 55, what more do you want?
