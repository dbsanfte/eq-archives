I don't think anybody here is saying it's the "only" reason, it's just 
the most important reason by far. If it were not, I would expect the US 
would be far more aggressive towards North Korea (which *does* possess 
weapons of mass destruction, by their own admission, and unlike Iraq, is 
not cooperating with the UN) than towards Iraq. Alas, North Korea 
doesn't appear to have any significant oil reserves.

On the other hand, I do agree that the Iraqi population at large will be 
better off without Saddam, that's why I'm not opposed to military action. 
I'm simply not blind as to what the actual motivation for that action is.
