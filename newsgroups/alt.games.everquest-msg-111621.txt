That's a logical assumption, but I don't think it's correct.

I used to have a zoning problem where whenever I zoned, I would be
bumped back to the server selection screen. When traveling by boat,
say going from freeport to bb, I would take this time to have a smoke,
make a sandwich, whatever and when I logged back in, I would be on the
boat in the middle of OOT - exactly where I would have been had I not
been bumped.
