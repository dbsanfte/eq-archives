Yep, I had my rockstar moment and decided that I really only needed a 
single moniker, but the quote is still valid.  My little bit of immorality 
I guess.  I have been told that on our next Fear raid I get to pull and 
try to break the bardic pull record.  It currently stands at 24 mobs on a 
single pull.  I think I can beat that, especially now with my long-lasting 
selos allowing me to twist resist songs so casters can't gank me.  The 
trick is to pull 25 mobs and not wipe the party out though, AE groups in 
Fear are fun, but they tend to scare the crap out of the guests.

Arolpin
still pulling trains
