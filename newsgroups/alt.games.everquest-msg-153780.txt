Yes, about two hours.

Actually this more cancels out the above limitation, rather than further
enhancing it.  By the time the wizard is ready to burn agian, another dragon
is ready to pop again.  They don't have to be there when it spawns, they
just have to hear about it within a reasonable time.  For a Kunark leve
guild (the kind that should really be the ones going after these dragons),
unless the guild finds out a half hour before a member of the MB team does,
thier vast mobility advantage (only 6 people, and they can all port
themselves to the location, no need to buff, etc) means they'll be ready to
pull first.

Yes, sometimes they'll spawn too close together, or after "Team Manaburn"
has had thier parents tuck them into bed, but this still doesn't mean too
many missed.  And you have to consider you're not talking about just 6
people per server... you're really talking about any bored level 60 wizard
that can find a few minutes to spare for a one in six shot at 50k worth of
loot.
