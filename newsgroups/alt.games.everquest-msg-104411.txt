Sadly, no. In fact, at this point, her cleric isn't getting much play at
all. She's pretty much lost interest and has been spending 90% of her
time on her suddenly level 27 necro. (And I mean *suddenly*). She still
dust's off the cleric when I really need her for a raid, but as in the
case of our last DN raid last weekend, if three other clerics show up,
she just buffs folks, wishes everyone luck, gates, and logs out.

Of course, now that I'm going nuts with my wizard, there's even less
times that she needs to. We're both getting a tad burned out on the post
55 game at the moment. Sometimes it's nice to take a break and go try
other things. I'm currently showing up for the raids people request that
I schedule for the guild and leading them, but aside from that, I'm
running my wizard around. :-)
