Well im hazy myself until I can properly test it.

I can't answer yet.  But what I can say is having 5 minis + SolRo, and
having 0-4 minis+ SolRo reports IDENTICAL text with the seer and named
drake.

Maybe the seer just doesn't mention some missing stuff, or maybe the solro
flag overwrites the minis flag..  as far as her text is concerned tho, there
is no difference at all
