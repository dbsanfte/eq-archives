My fault for not turning lfg off quickly enough, but twice now I've been
surprised at getting a second invite to a group and telling them I already
have one and how they get pissed off and try to talk me into leaving the
first one.  A couple of good invites have come and gone with people I knew
and respected just because I had committed to previous groups.  Those people
understood, for the most part, and appreciated the thought.  I guess LDN is
just such a hurry, hurry, hurry thing that people are going overboard.

Cacoph 56 Bard Povar

now mainly 27 Warrior Kraeton Povar

btw.  It's absurd how {relatively} easy dungeons are at this level compared
to upper 50's.  I know they should be harder at higher levels, but we have
cleared the dungeon each time on my lowbie and are lucky if we only have 2-3
corpses and a partial on the higher ones.
