Not so much elitist (though it is easy to be elitist at level 60, no doubt). 
It's more just the natural break points in the game.  Level 1 to 45, not
much changes.  Thus, that's "low" level.  45+ to 50, more changes.  Thus,
"mid" level.  51+ to 54, more changes.  I call this category "shaking out
the perma-low levels" but that's probably fairly elitist of me.  :)  Then
you have 55+, which is "high" level.  And level 60, "endgame" level.
