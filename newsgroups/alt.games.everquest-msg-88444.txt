	I have both.  It took me five months of joining every Hate raid I could to
get the LP...and I know Rangers who went twice that long and came up empty.

	I would not call the quest "interesting", even aside from the insane
rarity of the LP.  It's got no storyline to speak of, and while maybe someone
thought it was cute to make the Druid and Ranger quests the same up to a fork
near the end, it actually looks like they were rushed and used the same quest
for two classes to save time.
