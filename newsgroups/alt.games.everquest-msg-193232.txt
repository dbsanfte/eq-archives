You do need two CD sets if you want to go anywhere interesting.

Those are highgly neutered accounts. If I want to do anything useful with a 
second account (my number one thought, trader mule) I need to buy more 
software that I already bought.

Yes, the software costs money to distribute, market, burn, etc. I am not 
saying the *software* should be free, just that adding a second account 
should be. I already bought Luclin and PoP and LoY and Kunark and Velious, 
why in hell should I have to buy them again? They could just hook me up 
with a new account with the same upgrade flags as my main one for free, 
accepting the $150+ annual recurring income from me in lieu of charging me 
out the ass for software I don't need to by from a functionality 
standpoint. Or at least offer a "Bring Your Own Software" package, so I can 
get a deep discount buying the keys and they don't have to print/ship/etc 
yet another set of CDs.
