Yes, the Dread Wolves are there a lot. If you get one, keep running.

Worth repeating. 

HINT: In the corner, between RV and HP, there is always a cleric or a
knight there. IMHO thats the worst part.

At about 9AM gametime there is not any undead in Kith. They depop
sometime before then. On Test, I have never seen any with sense undead
at 9AM, and there are few people there to kill them.

Rogues has nothing much to fear there, as long as sneak and hide are
working. Sneak and hide works against everything, undead and regular
mobs. There are a FEW that may have a see invis, so I usually con. I
have not been caught in Kith day or night, and I still get nervous
when I see the commander pass me at close range.
