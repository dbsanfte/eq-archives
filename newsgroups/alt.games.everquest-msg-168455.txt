What he said.  Rotations only work when there are maybe half a dozen or so
guilds that can drop the target, and there is a clear and consistent way to
get on the rotation.  Much beyond that, and people start deciding that they
don't want to wait two months for their chance and kill it the next time
it's up.  

I'd go for it if I were you.  Just making the attempt may be enough to make
whoever manages the rotation put you on it.

For the last several months, my guild had been gearing up for NToV, which is
on a rotation on our server.  The person managing the list kept waffling
about what we needed to do to get a chance at killing Aary, which would
secure us a place.

Finally, about three weeks ago, we decided to just go for it, and headed in. 
As we were clearing our way up, our GL gets contacted by the list holder,
who suddenly decided that we were ready to get on the rotation, and our turn
would be up as soon as the current rotation cycle was complete.  So we
backed off.

Our turn came up last week.  Aary dropped on first pull.  We cleared NToV in
two weekday evenings, without a single wipeout.
