    I have good knowledge of one level 60 being sold on my server - the 60
in question posted his goodbye on a public forum, with link to the auction,
and the person who purchased him posted later to the same forums asking
about being guilded. This is what that transaction looked like:

    The price was well over $1000 U.S., as that's what it was at last time I
looked at the auction. The person who purchased the account had a 54 rogue
and 57 druid on another server, and wanted to see the end game up close on a
60 rogue. As conditions of the purchase, the original owner had all
pertinent information either provided to the purchaser, or changed with a
call to customer service to match the purchaser's information. The purchaser
already knew how to play a high level rogue, so no instruction was required
there. The original owner also spent a good deal of time informing the
purchaser about the politics of his new server, how he was regarded, faction
issues, etc.

    The purchaser was motivated to get all these items in place as he KNEW
what was required to keep the account secure after purchase, and because he
was paying a great deal of money for it. The seller, in addition to wanting
to get the money for the sale, may be motivated by pride - a part of him is
in that character, and I'm sure he didn't want the character to be wiped
away so quickly. It still boggles my mind that people would (a) drop that
kind of cash on a character, and (b) would NOT get that kind of
instruction/assurances with the deal.

    James
