Hiya,

We're looking into raiding Grieg shortly, and I was hoping to find
some direct information here from people that have raided him
recently. (since the revamp) We're a 60+ guild, with most people near
65. I've read up a bit about him, but have heard some conflicting
stories. Here's the questions I have.

1) What are approx hp? Is he slowable? What does he hit for?

2) AoE. How nasty is it? I know casters can be kept out of range for
it.

3) Does he still Curse? Will Greater Remove Curse be needed?

4) Do we need to clear guardians (or something like that) before we
can target him?

Any other help with him would be greatly appreciated.

Thankies!
