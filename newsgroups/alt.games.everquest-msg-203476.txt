I've also seen this defined as Monster or Beast.  Actually nether
definition really fits the term, since people will call static spawns,
even spawn-rooted things "MoB"s.  In other words, they aren't
necessarily mobile.  Meanwhile, not all things you kill are Monsters
or Beasts.  Some are PC races.  Some are bugs.

Also see:

Fear kiting - Snare it, fear it, do damage to it while it runs away.

Quad Kiting - Snare 4 MOBs and cast AoE's (a spell that does damage to
things within an area of the one you cast on--called area of effect
spells) on all four of them while you stay out of melee range.

Aggro kiting - This is a loosely used term which generally means one
person maintains aggro (meaning he is the one that the MOB wants to
kill the most) and leads the target around while others do damage to
it from behind.  Some people can aggro kite by themselves, for example
a necromancer or shadowknight can snare something, DOT it, and really
piss it off, then send their pets in to do damage while they just lead
the thing around in a circle.
