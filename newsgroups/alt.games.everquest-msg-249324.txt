Greater Faydark is pretty populated with new players on most servers,
I think.  It's the only newbie zone where you can go into town without
zoning, and it also has Crushbone next to it, which is a good zone for
getting experience.  There are two PoK stones to there, either to
Kelethin or Felwithe; take the Kelethin one to be closer to the Wood
Elf city where most of the people will be fighting (to run to the
guards for safety, of course).

Game on,
