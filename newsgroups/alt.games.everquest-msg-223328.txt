F8 sucks rocks atm (and for a while now).  I can be standing
straight in front of the grimling that spawns in the entrance
of AC and f8 won't target him.  However, I can stand a the end

spot with it.

/target a grimling bloodguard's corpse

Even for someone who is as keyboard centric as I am that's usually
for mobs in walls.
