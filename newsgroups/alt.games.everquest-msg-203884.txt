  The solo classes are always gonna have trouble getting a pickup
group at high levels. If you were putting together a pickup group,
would you choose a class where there's a good chance that the person
has been soloing for the last 2 years if you have a choice? 

Also, solo classes tend to be generalists, which makes it a lot harder
for that class to fill a specialist slot. A druid playing main healer
for a PoP group has to be a better player than a cleric filling that
same role. The druid doesn't have all of the tools a cleric does and
never will. There's a reason the grouping druids and necros with a
good rep don't have trouble (no more than anyone else) finding groups.
It's a bias built into the class that I don't think can or should be
fixed since the only way to fix it is to make them as good as the
specialists in their respective areas.
