Weeeee, don't have we a collection of bright and kind people in here.
To repeat what I already said: not everyone can install a newsreader.
Not because they are dumb idiots, like you assumed, but for example
when the administrator has disabled installation of software on their
computer at work. There are also plenty of dialup users or people at
work that are using ISP's which don't offer a news carrying server, to
name a second example.
