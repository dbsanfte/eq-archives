Hey all,
My Monk's 1hb and 2hb skills have been hurting lately, and as my Druid just
dinged 29 I have a new influx of cash flow. Anyways, I was wondering if
anyone in the great wisdom could assist me by letting me know a general
price on a few items. I am on Veeshan server, if that can help narrow it
down a bit.
Fighting Baton (Eqprices says it is around 600p, but that seems high to me,
am I wrong?)
Bamboo Bo Stick (Eqprices says around 130, too low?)
Admantite Bo Stick (630p from Eqprices, seems reasonable due to high damage)
I think that is all for now, oh, one final question, what does PC actually
stand for (assuming Price Check but not sure)?

Thanks all for your help, I really appreciate it!
Chaos
