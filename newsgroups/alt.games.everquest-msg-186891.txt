See, the odd thing is, the lounge/coffeshop is built *right* into the 
bookstore.  The only change is the flooring material. ;p  But they've 
got a couple signs around the edge of the lobby asking you to buy the 
books before you step over the invisible line. :)

And I know what you mean about bookstores.  I LOVE Chapters just for the 
fact that they've got the right idea about style - at least around here.  
There's also a used bookstore nearby that sells coffee.  Sadly, they 
have the 'new fangled' approach - ie make *money* from used books, so 
they're still 3 bucks apiece :/ still, when I'm broke, I can buy a $3 
book instead of a $10 book ;p
