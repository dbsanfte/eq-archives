Not true.

I'm in a smallish guild, and have been since level 9 (now 56), but 
can't imagine what a drag it would have been without my guild.

Guilds (well, good ones) add *far* more to your gaming than
just "raiding ability".  Here's something I wrote a while back
in response to someone who asked, "I mostly solo, why would
I want/need a guild?"

#### Repost starts here

Guilds provide a lot more than just ready-made raid groups:

1.  Companionship.  It helps pass the downtime during soloing.

2.  Entertainment.  Even if you aren't in the mood to gab yourself,
watching the conversations in guildchat can be pretty amusing.

3.  Reference.  Odds are, someone in the guild will know the
answer to that oddball question you've got, such as where
exactly to start a given quest, etc.

4.  Mentoring.  Most guilds have one or more folks who are
heavily steeped in the arcane knowledge of the game, and
can teach you about tactics, quests, items, hunting spots,
and so on that you might never have learned about otherwise.

5.  Twinking.  A_highlevel_guildmate_00 tells the guild, "I
just looted a nice Druid item, who needs it?"

6.  Discounts:  Most guilds have blacksmiths/tailors/jewelmakers
who will sell their wares to guildmates at cost, or close to it.

7.  Rescues/rezzes.  Sooner or later, you're going to die in
a really nasty or inconvenient place.  Guildmates are much more
likely to volunteer to help get you out of a messy spot than
passing strangers.

8.  Moral support.  When times get tough, having a "family"
in the form a guild can help you get through the bad times.

And who knows, once you have a guild full of people that you've
come to know well and trust, you might even enjoy hunting
in groups after all.  Hunting with guildmates is a much
better experience than trying it with pick-up groups of
unknown competence.

##### End repost

And I just thought of:

9.  Continuity.  Hunting partners in the game come and
go, as they hook up with other people, outlevel you,
you outlevel them, etc., but a stable guild is a bunch
of day-to-day friends that will be there for years,
sharing your triumphs and tragedies.
