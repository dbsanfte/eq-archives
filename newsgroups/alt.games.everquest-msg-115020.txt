FYI, the best cheap monk equipment I can think of is Polished Steel Ulaks. I
often see them auctioned for 100p in EC(vazaelle)... immediately followed by
someone auctioning them for 50p... I contact that second person and have
gotten them down to 25p before. They are very nice for a new monk with lots
of benefits.
