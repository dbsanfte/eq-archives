Yeah, I can agree with that one.  1500 damage AE, fires it off frequently,
unresistable (or at least I've never gotten even a partial resist).   Every
Agnarr raid I've been on so far has done him as ranged.

This was the actual Agnarr fight.

Maybe they got confused about what he actually did or something.   It would
not be the first screwup they did that night...  More than once we had three
different people shouting three different sets of contradictory instructions
into the raid channel.   Raid leader gave one set of instructions, the main
tank gave a second, and a wizard from the host guild (which all three
shared) gave the third.
