If for some reason you *can't* do the newbie armor (iksars still don't
have much along those lines), banded, plate, and various silk armors are
still possibilities.

I wouldn't use the adventuring level of a crafter as any guide as to whether
anything they can make would be level appropriate. I would however, suggest
taking into account that if there is some minimum level for *any* component
of what you're trying to commission, the final product should be considered
at least that high. This would include components created by spells or level
capped tradeskills. So no level 1 characters with Wu's (mana vials), enchanted
diamond velium earrings (mana vials again), Grobb liquidized meats (corking
device (isn't Tinkering level capped?)), or Robe of Abrogation (research).

That would pretty much cover the lion's share of the items with easy mob
drops or vendor components. Other than Misty Thicket Picnics, what else
is there?
