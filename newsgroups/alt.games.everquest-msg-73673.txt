Shrug. My main is a 57ish ranger (it has upsz and downs ;) ), but
when I get bored I pootle around on my 21 druid. I met a 60
druid recently who I get on withb *famously* and she wanted to try
rangering, so as a role reversal we decided she would be the ranger
and I the druid.

I lent her my druids (yeah, I know...) fungi tunic and FBSS (ranger
instincts, I mlee a lot, what can I say? ;) ) and in the course of
2 afternoons her ranger is now 21 too with all important skills
maxed.

This is having been powerlevelled by a level 21 druid and 56 ranger.

I am sure with a *real* powerleveller behind her that knew what they
were doing ( I dont, never done it before) it could have been done much
much faster. Hell, she didnt even train meditate and dodge till about
level 19 because it wasnt convienient.

Now, of course, levelling is much slower 'cause we're having a ball
exploring the midlevel luclin zones with our alts that would be
slaughter-fests with our mains. No hassle, no worries, die? so what,
its only the alts, etc. Lots of fun.
