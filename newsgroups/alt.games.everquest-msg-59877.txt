No, you trigger them by saying a phrase while standing near the throne. 
It's common to clear the room, do a cycle, then clear the room before
starting another cycle.  It's also common to come in there with overwhelming
force and do the cycle two or three times before the room pops, and with
such a force you don't even worry that the room popped, you just kill them
as they pop.  The regular spawns in that room aren't all that hard (I've
been known to solo them, though it hurts quite a bit).

And I think it's just a 2-hour wait if the dwarf gets away.
