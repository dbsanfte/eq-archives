 Oh come on. Were you around 20 years ago? Back in 1981 there were plenty of
extremely additive electronic games. My boss became a millionaire on them.
However, not one of them is around today. Sure, they weren't as good as EQ
but I would guess far more people were playing those games worldwide that 
there are people playing EQ today. Add to that the nature of gaming today. 
Games simply do not last very long anymore. How about Quake? Hundreds of 
thousands of people used to play Quake over the internet everyday. It used 
to be a daily habit for me for several years. Do you know of anyone playing
quake today? Nope.
 
 EQ will have a much longer run than those examples I cited above but seriously,
don't plan on it being around in 2021. Perhaps there will be some sort of
variation of it being played but it won't be like we know it today. You can
count on it. 
 
 I'll give EQ 5 years of life max before either Verant changes it or people
gradually migrate to the "next new thing to play". I bet the computers we 
will be using in 20 years won't even run EQ. Heck, I got games that are only
5 years old that work run on what I have now because the hardware has changed
so much. What was developed for P5s (the first pentiums also know as 586s) 
will not run on PIIIs now.
