Awww that sad :( makes me want to toss in any help I can, even if it may
not be much on this one.  I'd suggest trying the laptop from outside the
ICS, either loading it up with your public connection info and inserting
it in place of the ICS machine or just using a dial up connection.  The
idea is to see if its the ICS thats an issue or if the laptop itself has
a problem.  I'd previously heard of folks dropping on zone who used ICS
to proxy out their connection.  If you still have the problem with a
direct connect then you've got a bigger problem then finding a new proxy
platform.  I'd start with simplest, looking for IRQ issues, diabling
built in hardware features that are made redundant by add in hardware
(some MBs have built in sound/video hardware that may cause an issue in
EQ if not disabled when you add in other devices.  I have one PC that
crashed on every zone attempt until I disabled its built in sound in
CMOS even though I was not using it for sound, as an example).  If you
don't find anything along those lines I'd be looking at nic
driver/settings since you only have the issue on zoning.

Welp thats the best I can do, hopefully that either helps or someone
with better comes along.  Can't be much fun relogging after every zone
attempt.
