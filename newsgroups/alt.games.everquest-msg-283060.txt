But can you do that without the gear you have now? Can you do that with all 
of the other players and their brothers also there trying to do the same? 
Will you be able to do that in pre-Kunark zones? Pre-Velious?

remember being a cleric and still wearing banded mail well into my 30's - 
probably would have been longer had I not scrapped that character at that 
point for other reasons.
