What does that mean? As far as I can tell, it means that I will have control
of the mass media someday after obtaining the required training to do that
job. Might have some limited power over it now for all I know. I was reading
an interesting book last night about how there are two seperate entities
that existed to influence a population in the middle ages, the king and the
church. Seems like the church was always really in power since they could
say pretty much anything they wanted and say that God had inspired them to
say that and interpret the Bible in whatever manner they wanted.
