All the stuff in the Grey has obscene fire resists, I get about 3/4 resists
even after Ro's sundering (minus 40 fr, lure based), even get about 1/10
resists on Ro's, and that's a lure check; I've never had any major problems
landing anything off magic, except for when the rockfiends were buffed to
near 100% MR for a while and the worms always being immune to root/snare.
Then again, I don't have any disease or poison based spells like most shaman
dots, so I don't know how those work out, and I've never bothered with my
cold resist nuke there.

As far as I know, the necro that I was duoing with for a while was only
limited in that he wasn't using the Pyrocruor/Ignite Blood line, fun duo
too, I pull with snare and then bracer dot, keep him regen/skin (more
regen), he non-stop liches, fears, dots, /pet attacks (mmm...rogue pet...),
and taps judiciously; nearly zero downtime with that pairing, and incredible
exp.

Druid MR dots (Stinging Swarm/Creeping Crud/Drones of Doom/Drifting Death
line and Winged Death) seem to have a much lower resist rate than any other
MR spells such as nukes or snare, even though the dots don't have a lure mod
in the spdat.  I think it might be that the way resists are checked on
non-dd containing dots works out that partial resists (if it had been a
nuke) still allow the spell to land, but since there's no resist checks per
tick after the dot lands, it does full damage once it sticks.

Plus, the DD component on shm dots has a factor in resist rates, if the DD
is resisted, the dot doesn't stick; I checked Ebolt, Plague and all the
other shm dots back to level 24 or so, they all have the DD component (as do
all the dots that my level 11 shm has access to)
