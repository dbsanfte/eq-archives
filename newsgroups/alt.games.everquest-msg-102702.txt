Check the front page of castersrealm. They beat you to this post. They
have nerfs in place on test which limit a whole *bunch* of stuff.
Limiting the top damage of manaburn, limiting the top crit heals, some
other stuff. Basically doing just what you predicted, but to more
classes than just wizards.

That said, even with a limit, manaburn is still a pretty damn cool
ability.
