There is also the case of certain races that want to raise their
faction somewhere and kill greenies to do so (sure, PoP makes it
easier for people to get around as well as trainers in PoK so it's not
as much of an issue as it used to be,  but I imagine some players
still want to be able to not have to watch their backs all the time
and are willing to do faction work).
