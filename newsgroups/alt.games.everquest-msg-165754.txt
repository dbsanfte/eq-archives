Some time ago, a friend of mine expressed dismay on finding out
that the Mental Clarity AA does not stack with Flowing Thought,
after she'd invested some time in buying the AA.

Today, someone was asking about which AA to buy next, one pick
being MC... and I replied that I'd heard FT didn't stack with it.

Well, this was hotly debated in guild chat.  Personally, I've
only got an FT 1 item and no AA into MC, so its hard for me to
say.

Anyone with concrete evidence one way or the other?

Easy test would be to take off all FT items, and time mana regen
a bit, then put on as much FT as you have MC, and time it again.
If it doesn't stack, then you'll regen mana at the same rate each
way.

I'd do so while standing with no mana regen buffs on, so that the
effect from FT/MC will be a significant portion of your mana
regen rate.
