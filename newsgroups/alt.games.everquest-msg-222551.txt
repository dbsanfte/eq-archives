Yeah, felwithe guards are tough but good drop. Of course there's another
faction waster, HighHold Keep and their Guards (nobles will still give you
XP, if not kill you). Lesser drop per mob (aver. 7pp, including weapon), but
much easier to kill then Fw guards and less drastic faction change.
As for me, and my enchanter, who got his lizard at 44, I was charm-soloing
Rockhoppers since 39. And that took me 4,5 levels since I wasn't doing it
religiously. Plus on Lanys, hoppers are mostly left unharmed so you can
always have the whole cave to yourself, and hides are in high demand
(strange, but Lanys has unusual economy IMO)
