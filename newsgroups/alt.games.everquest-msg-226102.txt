On Test there is an ingame command:  /testbuff
This raises your character to L25, maxes his skills for L25, gives him
some nodrop gear that varies wildly in quality from one class to the
next, and puts most of a spellcasters spells into their spellbook
(always leaves at least one crucial spell out, for example Shaman do
not get Cannibalize when they /testbuff).  At least, that's how the
command worked months ago when they put it in, I assume it's still the
same as I've seen no comments to the contrary.
