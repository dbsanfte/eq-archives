I should mention explicitly that *if* a group member does not have a
better buff, the Valor line is more mana-efficient than (for example)
GHeal for healing. Personally I gave up on this almost as soon as I
started as the druid Skin line gives more HP and therefore Valor will
not overwrite it. Tracking who had which buffs got to be a major pain.
This is doubly so when Temperance, Aegolism and Virtue are figured in.

It's a neat idea to keep in mind when yours are the only HP buffs being
used however.
