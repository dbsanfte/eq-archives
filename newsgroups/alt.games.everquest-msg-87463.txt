My old isp had a status service that - shock! - not only told you
you couldnt log in to a particular service, but the ETA to fix.

I couldnt log in yesterday, as I went LD. My groupmates were waiting
for me. Instead of sitting trying for 10 minutes so they weren't left
wasting their time it would have been nice if the network status
page actually had said "this isnt gonna come back any time soon, go
do something else".

Equally, if trying to assess the stability of the game, etc, the lack
of updates screws you. Of course, this may be one reason they dont
update it, if you're on the conspiracist side of the group.
