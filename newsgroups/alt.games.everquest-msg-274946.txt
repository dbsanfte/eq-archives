That's about 2 degrees too much separation to be truly valuable, but any
tidbit helps, I guess :)

That's a very large number of facelifts.  I might even say an unbelievable
number.  Either these will be incredibly cookie-cutter jobs, with a designer
spending no more than a few days on each, or most "facelifts" will be
near-trivial changes.

I hope this means texture and overall quality, not in any specific of
bubble-faced cartoon sameness.

That's more than any source I've seen, by a factor of 3.  I'd believe 1.3
million characters, or 1.3 million accounts ever created (including the
freebie friend/phisher accounts).  

Whoever said 1.3M subscribers is misinformed, or the statistic has been
mangled in the retelling.
