PoJ has also emptied out a bit since they made everything unfearable. 
Some other bits of information for low-50's groups camping in the GY:

-You are not KOS to anything near the entrance and exit.  Unlike other
planes, the exit is inside just a bit, but not hard to find.

-Get someone level 56 or higher to pull if at all possible. 
Everything in there is social, however nothing near the entrance will
add after level 55.  You can pull right through MOBs and they just go
about their business.  If you don't have someone this high, be very
careful with your pull; do not pull any guards (they run around and
get friends unlike other MOBs).  If the puller gets a train, he can
easily zone out and zone back in.

-Kill, or keep track of when Sralm Noramir goes down.  This is the
only baddy that will aggro to the GY no matter what you do, at your
level.  (others aggro if you get too close to their cells while
fighting, which are positioned around the courtyard zone-in area)  He
is on a 19 - 20 minute timer.  Do not be in the middle of a fight when
he pops if you dont have a chanter or someone who can off tank him. 
Among the entrance MOBs, he hits harder than the rest and is probably
higher level.  He seems to resist more often as well.

55+ rangers can even tank these things, so a 52 SK should be golden.
