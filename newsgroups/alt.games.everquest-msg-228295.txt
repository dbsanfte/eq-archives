yeah. I feel your pain.

Mine is 
/gsay Helping - %T -
/assist 
/pause 2
/gsat Die  you - %T -

I target the main tank while waiting on the pull, and then hit my all
purpose attack key. I often use f8, but either on themelle side or the
chanter side I do different things.

(a poor acsii drawing of a pillow)

Hey I use assist because I am lazy, I get back there and whack, or
mez.

One thing you may not be considering is that I often Group mez, I use
it to get the mobs sorted out. Your methond may not work unless the
melee breaks mez quick. When the melee breaks the group mez on the mob
he is currently whacking I yell pull back so I can identify the mezzed
mobs properly and apply the correct mez/memwipe combination.
