I'm not laughing...  I'm dead serious.  There are people who are beyond
clueless.  Somewhere, out there... There is a list of actual Tech support
calls floating around.  One where someone didn't know there was a power
button to a computer, another who refered to the Mouse as the 'foot pedal'.
The most infamous one is the 'My coffee holder broke...'

There is even a little program with the Coca-cola sign, saying, "Christmas
Gift From Coca-cola", which opens up your CD Rom drive if you have a tray
loading CD-Rom.
