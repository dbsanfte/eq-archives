I never even attempted the "workaround" as you choose to call it. (Fact
is, let's face it, it was an exploit, but not a serious enough one for
them to bust anyone's balls over.) But can you honestly say you were
surprised? Every positive has a balancing negative in this game. You
want to med incredibly faster without sitting down and avoiding sit
aggro? You get the annoyances that go with the horse. (Slower movement,
non-immediate start/stop, no ducking). I've just been using the horse
with the models turned on all along. I think they look pretty sharp. If
you're surprised to see that particular bug fixed, you're pretty naive.

What I'm waiting for now are the cries of righteous indignation from the
unwashed masses.

"Waaaaaaaaaaaa! If I can't cheat and abuse the horse thing for free fast
mana regen with none of the horse effects, I'm selling my horse back and
quitting the game! Waaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"
