I guess I keep approaching this as if you will care about this
character after level 10.  If you wont at all, then choose whatever is
most convenient for the single purpose of tracking your quest items. 
Heck, choose the race that appears--upon creation--closest to a PoK
book.  =)

I can take a melee in these levels and kill things, with Temperence
up, that I could never kill with SLN.  The higher HP allow me to
survive the fight and the higher AC mean I have less hp to heal back. 
Killing yellows and reds is faster experience.  I love getting temp on
a noob.  And the difference in experience gained between a blue and a
red or yellow at these levels is also much more noticable than it is
at higher levels.  Killing a level 2 may well give you twice as much
experience as a level 1, just speculating based on experience.  So
killing higher level mobs is very advantages early on.

Maybe for the first 2 or 3 levels.  I seriously doubt this is true
beyond that.

...yet since you also have 32 more AC, you will have less damage to
recover...at a time when your unbuffed AC will be incredibly low.

Once again, if you want to choose the buff that will let you win
tougher fights, Temperence is the clear choice.  More HP and more AC
means you will survive when the guy who had SLN is running for the
zone.

You can also /autoinv everything you forage.  It can be annoying to
have those roots or foraged vegetables on your cursor.  Targeting
people will tell them you want to trade, or will even place you as
their target if you are in close range...which could even be lethal in
certain instances.  It is also impossible to mem spells, change out
gear, etc...
