I don't think they meant for the typical level 32 to get the top end
horse.  At very high levels, money is easier to come by.  I asked a
friend who is in one of the best guilds in the game (Legacy of Steel)
how long it would take him to go from 0 to 100k, and he said that a
group from LoS could farm enough in about a week to get 100k for
everyone in the group.  The bastard wouldn't tell me exactly what they
would farm, though.  Grrrr!

The funny thing is, it's not clear that horses would be useful to
them.  Go read www.legacyofsteel.com, and Tigole's complaints about
his horse.  Basically, you can't use the horse if you don't use the
new model for your race.  Using the new model for his race makes
things too slow on raids.  Switching models requires exiting and
restarting, which takes a long time.  Tigole doesn't do anything
except raids.  Net result: horse is completely useless to him. :-)
