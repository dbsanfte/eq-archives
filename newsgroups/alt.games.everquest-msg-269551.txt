slrn.  Yeah, there's a windows console version as well.  It's tough to top
the clarity of display of a simple console when dealing with text.  Been
using it for years, and I don't see a change looming.  =)

I also use it for binaries, sometimes in combo with nget (which I'm not sure
there's a windows version of).
