Basic question is this, is there a difference?

Ok, I've killed a bunch of white coning werewolves in EverFrost Peaks
during Gm events. Not too bad, I mean I take some damage but it's a
safe thing as long as I don't get greedy and not take the time to heal
and rest between fights. Now there is this damned werewolf that has
killed me more then a few times in WK. I want to bite this werewolfs
ear off and feed it to him, very badly. I just hit level 20 and he now
cons white. I have enough exp so if I go down I won't lose my level, I
hope. However, I've read this is a level 25 wolfy, I'd rather not die
if it can be helped. Advise please.
