Erm...no sadder than actually playing the game in the first place, how you
do it is upto you. I refuse to use certain weapons due to the way they look
and I used to try and keep my armour coordinated, this has fallen by the
wayside a bit recently with me wearing a mixture of crafted, rygorr,
treeweave, cobalt and some mithril but you get to a point where you have to
compromise looks for usefulness, still not going to wield any weapon that
resembles an experiment in artistic weilding gone wrong.

CF
I have a full suit of shiny FS Plate in case I ever need to attend an EQ
Wedding, doubt I'll ever wear it tho, these always a fight at weddings and I
don't want to be wearing a suit of FS plate incase I get involved ;ï¿½)
