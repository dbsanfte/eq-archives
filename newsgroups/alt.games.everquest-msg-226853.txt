Basically if you are in a pick-up group, you need to find out what the
loot rules are, if you dont, you have done yourself a dis-service. 
When you group, simply ask, 'What are loot rules'.  If you dont like
them you have the choice of staying or leaving.  Lotsa times the ML
will have to sell to split since depending on where you are (PoJ is a
good example) very little drops if anything.  And if something does,
it needs to be sold for the split.

Its just something you need to work out when you join the group.
