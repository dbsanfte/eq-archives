I don't think class makes a big difference in "real" money making...  druids
and wizards would be an obvious choice here, but honestly, I can kill junk
mobs and make double what you make from ports in the same period.. or make
similar money + exp..

I went from 1-60 with no money, ever.. my gear sucked, I couldn't buy
upgrades cuz I had nada for the longest time.

Now tho, I have too much money to realistically spend (I could buy 4 bard
speed horses and still have pp left).. but thats just me, I don't spend shit
on my monks, bots or twinks.  Sure I could of outfitted my twinks better by
spending money at the start of their life, but the final outcome (gear at
the level they are now) would still be the same.. its just how you chose to
level your chars I guess

I think if I'd been any class instead of a monk, I'd have had the same
progression.. id have the same kind of gear and money as I do now.. just
with different stats and names.  Its just the player/person I am, not the
character I made

Yeah.. thats about the best way of summing it up.

If bards were as common as druids or warriors I think they'd be raped with
the nerf bat 100x worse than monks got...

They aren't an obviously powerfull class.. so 99% of "i wanna be a badass
uber mofo" people will ignore a bard.. group DA needs to go though, and
group FD?  ....

Druids.. well they can do a lot.. too much?  Doesn't matter to me, because
they aren't an optimal class in my groups (my groups consist of
tank+healer+monks/rogues/rangers.. thats it) and I know other people who
think like I do.  I see druids whine "lfg still...  3 hours..." and I guess
desire for them offsets all their skills to make some kind of balance

Rogues.. well their damage is streets ahead of everybody.. too far?  maybe
so. but a lot, if not all of their skills are group dependent.. they aren't
uber damage dealers solo, and sure they can solo but not great.. having to
rely on a group kinda balances them

I don't think any class is totally overpowered at raid, solo and grouping,
I'd add bards as the exception, but they are too unique and rare to really
be a problem.

I DO think some skills are way way over powered though..
Rogues shroud is just too over powering
Bards escape (why is it 1/3 the refresh time that rogues is??), bards group
DA, and Bard group FD all need to go.
Bards/Enchanters/Clerics lull line of spell.. it used to be a joke spell
you'd never use, now its a godly spell that beats harmony (which was over
powering, and got nerfed).

I don't understand lull, btw...  they decided harmony was too powerful, and
it got nerfed (I don't disagree with that), but remember harmony is an
outdoor only spell.

In the same breath though, they took a worthless spell, and made it better
than harmony (works in dungeons).. none of the classes who received it are
under powered in the slightest either (chanter bard and cleric may well be
the strongest 3 classes in eq) and they sure as hell didn't need the upgrade

Clerics getting a spell haste buff.. didn't seem to make much sense either..
surely it would have been better suited to an enchanters lineup?  Oh well,
not overpowering so it doesn't really matter..

Oh and 1 more overpowered thing - cleric summoned hammer!  Its an absolute
joke that a common as hell spell makes a weapon that is >>> 99.99% of cleric
weapons, including weapons from the highest level mobs and zones.
