Personally I like the plain dictionary definition:

Evil:
Anything which impairs the happiness of a being or deprives a
being of any good; anything which causes suffering of any kind
to sentient beings; injury; mischief; harm

Source: Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary, ï¿½ 1996, 1998 MICRA, Inc.

Seems pretty clear to me.

This has to go along with intent of any person
committing any action of course.
