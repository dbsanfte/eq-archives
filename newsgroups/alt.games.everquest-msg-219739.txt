I want to thank everyone who gave their advice about my friend making a
Pally, and his chances of being the MT for our guild. :)  He told me later
that he didn't mind making a warrior as well if necessary, but he prefers
a paladin as his main because he is accustomed to having some casting
power.

As luck would have it, his RL brother who may be returning to EQ has a 41
warrior already, so that might not even be necessary.  And as I said,
we're not, nor ever will be, a raiding guild. :)  Nor just a grouping and
chatting guild. More like a chatting and exploring.  We're all the sort
that like to challenge ourselves, but our idea of a fun challenge is more
dungeon crawling than raiding.  Loots aren't as good, but it can be just
as rewarding. :) (Not even referring to LDoN here...I still don't have
it.)  And two things that make every dungeon crawl 100% more fun...a
rezzer and a corpse summoner!  Our other officer is a necro, so I'm very
very fond of the idea of having a pally as our MT.
