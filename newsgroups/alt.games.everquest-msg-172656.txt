Dear Reader:

As you may be aware, cellular phones are beginning to offer features
such as larger color screens, built-in digital cameras, downloadable
games and location-based information among other things.  I am
investigating the potential demand of such features and how consumers
will use those features.

Within this message is a URL to a short survey that should take less
than five minutes to complete.  The information will be used to
understand which of the advanced features offer wireless users the
most value.  Survey responses are anonymous and will be kept
completely confidential.  You will not be solicited by any means as a
result of completing this survey.

Please take a few minutes to complete the short survey.  Your input
and feedback is very valuable in determining what features will be
placed in next generation wireless phones.  Any feedback you provide
would be greatly appreciated.

Please go to the following URL to complete the survey, if the URL does
not appear as a link, please copy and paste it to your address bar to
get to the survey:

Thank you for your time and cooperation!
