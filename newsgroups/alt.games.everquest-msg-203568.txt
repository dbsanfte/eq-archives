I'm in a guild that can't really and doesn't raid anything other than Kael
and Epic mobs.  Even then it's usually in alliance with other guilds.  And
that's fine by me, because I'm not in it for that anyway.

The dungeons sound superb.  Virtually all of my game time doing stuff other
than tradeskills is spent in groups of 5 or 6, and we rarely do dungeons
because it's easier to work around other people in open outdoor zones.

Looking forward greatly to this expansion - and I don't mind if all the
high-end players quit the game over it.
