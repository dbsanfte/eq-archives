Actually, I'm not convinced that Root/Snare/DoT is more mana efficient than
Snare/DD. Of course you end up with more mana left using Root/Snare/DoT
AFTER THE KILL, but it also takes much longer to make the kill than does
Snare/DD. In other words, you're medding DURING the battle when you
Root/Snare/DoT, but when you use Snare/DD, you can med AFTER the battle.

Here's an example (using sample numbers...not real data): Say you take 3
minutes to kill a mob using Snare/Root/DoT, and you're medding for 2 minutes
out of those 3 minutes. Now say you take only 1 minute to kill a mob using
Snare/DD, you can then med for 2 minutes following the kill to see how your
mana level compares with Snare/Root.

I'm not advocating one method over the other, but I think many people see
higher mana levels immediately after the kill using Snare/Root/DoT and
automatically think it is more mana-efficient. It is definitely not that
simple.

I plan on running a little test later tonight. I'll post the results for
those of you who are interested. I'd also like to see your opinions in the
mean time.

Thanks.
