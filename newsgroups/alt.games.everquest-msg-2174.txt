  Agree 100% play a character before going on about how under nerfed it is.
I don't have a high level anything but I made lvl 19 on my druid and now I'm
bored.  Yea it's great to SOW and self TP but so what, I pull out my low
level necro and I can fear things (not just animals) or I can pull out my
level 15 mage and blow things up with the help of a tank that always wants
to group with me (my pet for those that didn't get it).
  You anti druid people need to get on with your life or play one!  If you
don't want to be one of the many wood elf druids then be a female human one
(*gasp*) and be different!! Or better yet why not stop paying Verant your
$10 a month and go away.
  Every character is fun if you think it is, any character is the most
powerful in the game if you play your character right.  What does that mean?
If your a cleric you heal and rez, you can't run fast you can't TP but you
can heal and rez like no other.  If your a warrior you can get beat up and
keep going, I sure as hell can't do that. If you want to be an enchanter
then you mezz and debuff and buff you don't get to TP.  These are the things
you know about each character, don't be jealous of what he can do and you
can't look at what you do better than them (whoever they are?).

If any of this didn't make sense blame it on the fact that I have only
played about 5 hours of EQ since Sunday morning and I am going through
withdraw.

Fubr lvl 19 Druid
Fizbun lvl 15 Mage
Raiguy lvl 7 Necro*
Nubzuf lvl 7 Warrior
The Tribunal


* watch him he's going places!!!
