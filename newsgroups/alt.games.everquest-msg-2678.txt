Generally, specialization does next to nothing for you. When capped, it 
redices the amount of mana used by 6%.
If you still want the answer, the most common pick for a shaman is 
alteration. That includes all the useful buffs (except guardian series), 
heals and debuffs.
Second choice is conjuration, which includes all the DoTs and some of 
the best nukes (as far as nukes go that is)
