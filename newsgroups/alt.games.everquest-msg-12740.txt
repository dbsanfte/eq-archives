I was just reading the review article in Computer Gaming World about the EQ
expansion "The Shadows of Luclin" and I was wondering why the expansion
wasn't called EQ2.  The article said that Shadows will be a major overhaul
of the game, add a whole new world (the moon), and even include a new game
engine.  Why isn't this considered EQ2 then?  What more would EQ2 be?  I
assume EQ2 wouldn't just scrap the entire universe of EQ and put in a new
one, but build off of EQ.
