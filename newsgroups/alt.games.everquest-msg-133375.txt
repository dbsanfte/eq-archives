EQ,

Nope, sorry.  I was very clear on the fact that it wasn't attributed to me.
See, I take time to read what's in front of me, think about it, and reason
the steps through.

I did, however, feel that it was an opportunity in which to attempt to make
a point, which I had hoped that you might acutally follow through on reading
and take time to reason through.  Again, you have shown that you either
cannot, or will not do this.
