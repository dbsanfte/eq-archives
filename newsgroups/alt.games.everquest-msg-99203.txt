This is a level 48 bard.  It would have to be a HUGE damage shield to power 
level this way.  Bards are rather wimpy compared to mobs post level 20.  :)

This is a very good idea...though the timing might be tough, and would probably 
require very good knowledge of exactly how powerful each nuke is to do it 
reliably.  I get the idea that the poster is not tha familiar with the druid 
though.
