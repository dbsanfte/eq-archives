Used to farm the HELL out of the AC and sell MQ rights back when I
played alot.  Two keys to getting the AC.  

1) Kill the oddly named spawns....meaning instead of "A desert madman"
look out for "A madman".  Instead of "A Desert Rattlesnake"...look for
"A rattlesnake"..You'll see a shit load of crypt mummies....then
you'll see A Sand Mummy....hmmm he just doesn't belong.....after a
while you'll notice the mobs that are named oddly.  Also kill all sand
giants, Hussein, Terrorantula, Young Ronin and the other named mobs
that spawn.  If you can, use a tracker.  You notice as soon as you pop
one of the aforementioned oddly named spawns..another odd one with pop
up.  

2)  Turn your speakers up LOUD.  When the AC spawns he starts to walk.
If you have your speakers up LOUD, you can hear him walking just about
any place on the desert sand no matter where on the sand you are.
This is the single best thing you can do to ensure you get to the AC
first.  I've gotten to AC's(without using track) that I did not see in
the far north east corner in a canyon simply because I could hear him
walking from the my location at the merchants.


Of course, there are probably a million different theories on how to
spawn him(and I'm sure someone will mention the tower spawn that I
never bothered to kill).....but in my day I probably killed the AC
close to 40 times and the above two things worked great for me.
