    A SHM, DRU, MAG, BST could also all solo camps in there, just not as
many at once. We used to have a druid in guild that would go to Droga on
server-up, hit tracking, and kill any named in the place that was up. It's
tough to design content that level-appropriate people can duo but which
cannot be soloed by someone of higher level. Far better to keep the higher
levels out, and the best system for that is LDoN.
