Would go for either an SSB or Rygorr Coif. both AC13 (coif has no graphic)

> Face-> Cold Iron Mask    (5ac)
Antlered mask AC7 +3str +5agil +2dex or Sarnak Hide mask AC6 +5str

> Neck-> Orc Fang Necklace (3str/sta/agi)
For stamina, Clattering Bone Necklace AC8 +6str +6sta +30hp Drops in Grey
off Heirophant Grazan, this I believe is the booby prize so often sold, his
other drops are nice items (bone handled scimitar and bone braced buckler)
so he's prolly perma camped. Spider Fur Collar AC10 +7str +7pois/cold

> Chest-> Ry'Gorr Battle Mail (18ac 10str)
If you want to spend cash, Barbed Ring Mail, otherwise just look for more
AC, as a Wood elf, you can wear a Dusty BP (22AC +5sta +20hps) drops off
Dustback in FM but a bitch of a spawn, especially alone PH's in 4 corners,
could maybe buy one for 200pp.

> Waist->Troll Hide Belt (5ac 5str 5sta)
Would go for Black Alloy girdle for the extra AC (lose strength tho) Spider
fur belt if you want more AC (10ac +5 dex/agil +40hp)

> Legs-> Ry'Gorr Leggings (13ac 2sta/dex)
I like these legs for this level. Can't recommend anything easily
affordable, obtainable.
Crystal Chitin Legs, AC15 +5 stamina, from velks.

> Feet-> Singing Steel Boots (21ac)

> Arms->Ry'Gorr Armgaurds (11ac 3agi)
CC arms AC18 +5str/sta seen them for 3k, drop in Velks.

> Hands->Gnome Skin Gloves (5ac 5agi 5dex)
Anything with more AC, Ry'gorr, lambent etc.

> Wrist->Scavenger Bracer (9ac 5str/dex)
> Wrist->Blackened Alloy Bracer (8ac)
Hero or Crusty bracer, the lambent Bracers aren't bad (crusty has 4stam but
at the cost of 5 cha)

> Finger->Platinum Fire Wedding Ring (5ac 55hp)
> Finger->Velium Fire Wadding Ring (6ac 65hp)

> Ear->Orc Fang Earing (3ac 3 str 15hp)
> Ear->Orc fang Earing (3ac 3 str 15hp)
Sonic Wolf Claw earings AC3 +2str  +3sta +3agi +2dex, drop off Ski'etcha or
something like that, Sonic Wolf caves near Kitty City in Hollow shade.

> Primary->Di'zok Wristsnapper (10/18)
> Secondary->Centi Short Sword (12/25)

> Ranged->Orb of Echo Ore (20hp 20 mana)
Goranga Idol, drop off Goranga Gatherers and Hunters in Maidens Eye. AC8
+3sta +4dex +25hp

If you play off hours and on a quiet server (is legends quiet) try farming
the elementals in Twilight Seas (this zone is, maybe, second only to Shar
Vahl for FPS hits) bit of a pain with out a tracker but the named and even
titled can drop some nice items, expect to spend 3 - 4 hours killing greens
tho, and even then no guarantees.
