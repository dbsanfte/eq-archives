Starting stats dont matter a bit for an enchanter. You can play a high elf
and put 25 points into dx and its really not going to harm you a bit . Pick
a race for the inherent advantages of the race. Faction or special
abilities. Be agnostic unless you realy WANT to roleplay a religious
chanter.

Hps and mana are important. Flowing thought and focus effects are very
important, spend all your twink money here.
