Ok, I'd agree that it's hypocrisy, all right, but I'd say it's a heck of a 
long way from 'biggest' or 'height'.  In comparison to a murderous doctor 
or a Jewish pig farmer, it's simply nowhere near the league.

I'm suprised you didn't also recognize 'Plugh', then, since it served much 
the same purpse in the same game. :)

}I would think about that one... Tempted to Petition If I saw it live.

Well, Snafou was created in a fit of upsetness over bad things that 
happened with Trud's faction that weren't his fault, and I think the name 
perfectly reflects that. :)  I've since decided, however, that those same 
 events and my reactions to him have added great depth to Trud's 
character... He's now angry at the world since he lost access to his 
primary hometown, Neriak, and will take it out on any stinking little NPC 
that looks at him funny.  He's still, deep inside, a big, poor, 
misunderstood creature, but now he simply doesn't care about the 
consequences as much.  It was a lot of fun to be on a total 
uncontrolled rampage for a while. :)

As a result, Snafou has pretty much become a spare bank space character, 
although I might use him to hunt up a passel of lizard tails sometime 
soon.  And I'm therefore really not that attached to the name anymore, so 
if petitioned, I'd probably change it without much hesitation... other 
than that necessary to think up another name. :)

But despite all that, it _really_ doesn't seem obscene in the least to me, 
so I have difficulty grasping the concept of other's offense by it.

Apparently so. :)
