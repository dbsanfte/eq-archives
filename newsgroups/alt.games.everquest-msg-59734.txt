Celerity I believe.
As for sufficient, the exp grind mobs die so fast given the stupid
mudiflation of items, anything past 50% effective haste is what I
would call sufficient.  You can get that with FBSS and a low level
haste.

Remember, we're talking about mobs that's on par with old world mobs.
Back when the "best" weapons most tanks had were a pair of Yaks
(8/24).  These days, I don't think I've seen a warrior in Velks
without at least a Lam--most have frostbringers and velium stuff from
DN.
