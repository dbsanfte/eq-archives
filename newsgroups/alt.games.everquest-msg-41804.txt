Fear, for a cleric, is not a solo activity.  Need a snaring partner for fear
to work as anything but a life preserver.  However, I suggest that over
the life of a cleric up to 52, at any rate, cleric is probably better at
fear than any class out there.  Sure was better at fear than my necro
by 18, at any rate.

I do think though, that causing a mob to not attack, not cast spells,
not parry or otherwise defend itself in any way, would be the most
powerful debuff in the game.  Ferbrellsake don't Root my feared mob!

Fear kiting is, to be sure, an art, and one best practiced out of doors
in an area you know well.  Done properly, though, it is one of the
most mana efficicient, safest hunting practices in the game.

Soloed at least half of each level 45 to 52... not using Fear to
do so at all, though.
