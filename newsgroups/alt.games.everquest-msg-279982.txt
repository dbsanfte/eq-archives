Yes,GoD better,because no senseless leveling needed.When I said worst
it was refered to the raising of the level cap,for me it made the game
less enjoyable,for one as mentioned I need to do the xp tread mill
again instead of becoming stronger with making AAs,other point 
being that there are now a lot of under equipped with no AAs to
speak of level 70s,who are remarkable weaker than my 66 and 67 chars,
but hey they can enter RSS.  :p
