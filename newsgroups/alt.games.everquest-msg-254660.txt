No, true, but then NOTHING has been able to shrink them for quite some
time.  Used to, mind you...

No, I was just experimenting with Shrink and noticed it enlarged the
pet to full size again - odd.

Another odd thing was the size of mage pets that I got with Monster
Summoning I - in one zone, I got a Cyclops the size of a halfling, and
in another I got a tiny griffon.  In PoK the pet became a tiny earth
elemental. Next night, when I travelled through PoK, the earth
elemental was full-size, heh.

Lord knows what the situation will be tonight :D
