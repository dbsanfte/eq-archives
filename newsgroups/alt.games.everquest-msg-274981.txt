Just a word from my guild member who knows GMs and programmer:

The dreaded Skeleton even will be coming back.  They were around to
celebrate EQ's 5th anniversary, and terrorized us again last
Halloween.  The Skeleton event is likely to come back again every
Halloween and they also will be back this April.

Should this pan out, I wouldn't bind my soul in any of the skelly
zones.  I don't like this and not many people does but it is a chance
for new people who missed the first 2 times around to get some decent
low level items.

I would have prefered a different event.  The one a few years ago in
Rathe Mountain was fun. =)
