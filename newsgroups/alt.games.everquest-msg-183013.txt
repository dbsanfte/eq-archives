    Stop right there. The new pet buffs are just combinations of two spells
that the class in question already has. Take the magician one, Elemental
Empathy (level 52 spell). The pet buff part is 60% haste, +60 STR, +18 AC.
At level 49 the mage got Burnout III, a pet buff which is 60% haste, +50
STR, +13 AC. The "recourse" part of Elemental Empathy gives the mage
70+3xlevel HPs, 13+0.3xlevel AC, and 10+level/3 MR. At level 54 mages get
Shield of the Magi, which gives 70+3xlevel HPs (capped at level 60),
13+0.3xlevel AC (capped at level 60), and 4+level/3 MR (capped at level 60).
So two levels after getting Elemental Empathy, the mage is getting almost
nothing they don't already have. Three levels after getting EE, mages get a
new pet buff with 65% haste (Burnout IV), so now they have to choose maximum
pet ability or mana efficiency with EE.

    I think the mana efficiency is worth it, at least in the . Not all mages
have Velious leggings (right-clickable Burnout III), after all. But it's
hardly what one would call a "powerful" spell.
