I was grouped with a lvl 30 cleric who preferred to use celestial
remedy on the tanks to heal them.  When my cleric was lvl 20, I ran a
test on myself and found that celestial remedy healed for 200ish
points.  Since this cleric was using celestial remedy, I figured I
should test it again since maybe the healing power increases as the
cleric levels (my cleric is now level 32).  

I nuked myself to 370 HP and cast celestial remedy.  Afterwards, my HP
was 630, where my max HP at the time was in the 700s.  So I healed
myself for 260 points, shrugged, and wondered why the cleric was so
insistant on using this spell. 

Later, I was grouped with the same cleric and she mentioned it healed
for 460 points!  I about fell out of my chair, and asked if she was
sure.  She had no idea why my cleric couldn't heal as well.

Then, I look at  castersrealm and everlore and they say it heals for
260 points.  

So, are there any other clerics that can heal for 460 points using
celestial remedy?  I haven't been using this spell since I got greater
healing, since greater healing heals for 315 points at a cost of 150
mana, versus celestial remedy which for me heals 260 points at a cost
of 190 mana.
