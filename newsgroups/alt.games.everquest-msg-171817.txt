Source for making flasks of water cheap (4 pods plus one bottle gives a
flask), that can then be used in smthing direct (OK trivialities for high
levellers but at low level is significantly reduced the cost on my
starting smithing)...also can then be combined with excess berries and
fruit that have been foraged for fruit and berry juices (I think one flask
plus 2 of one type of the foraged stuff for 5 juices)....

So overall 4 foraged water, 1 purchased bottles, plus 2 foraged berries
would give you 5 juices....and they are better than standard drinks
IIRC...I think you a) end up ahead once it all trivials, b) the juices can
be sold...all for the outlay of a few copper for the bottle.

Its moderatly cosmetic but for a forager its a useful way to blast up the
start of brewing, gives something you can hand to others that aint too
bad, the cosmetic changes are interesting to some degree....
