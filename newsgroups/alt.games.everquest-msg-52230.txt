   I managed to have pain and sufferin take out my level 4
earth pet last night by taking on a giant spider while 
I was at level 6.  I know it was poison that did the little
bugger in because he bit it after the spider had turned to
flee.  It was sort of an epic battle, as far as these things
go for that low a level.  My pet tanked, I nuked (if you can
call 14 damage a "nuke") and my pet would thoughtfully root
it just before dying.  I would cast another pet, rinse, and
repeat.  Final score: spider- 4, Me- 1 ....barely.
