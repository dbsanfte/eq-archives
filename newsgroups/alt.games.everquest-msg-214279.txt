I have the same problem, and same solution.  Sometimes, though, it bites me in
the ass; I do it so regularly that I tend to do it with game commands.
Usually no problem, but for some reason some commands are coded so they do
nothing if you put a space after; for example I was convinced for quite some
time that /pet report didn't work.  Really I was typing "/pet report  "
instead of "/pet report", and the game was ignoring me because of the
gratuitous space.
