It's true as far as it goes but Tim Smith in his haste to label Mythic
as doing everything right while everyone else is doing everything
wrong neglected to mention a few things not covered by that - like how
much of DAoC's code was lifted wholesale from earlier projects (and
therefore not counted as part of development costs), how many corners
were cut (massive repetition of mob models and dungeon layouts among
other thigns), an abbreviated beta sequence (that left much of the
game's content either missing or untested), stuff like that.

Of course if you see setting your sights low enough that you can
easily hit it as being "well managed" then Mythic is quite the success
story. Try to do nothing innovative, take no risks, and aim for "good"
rather than "great" and you won't have any "growing pains" like so
many other mmorpgs. It also explains why, despite perfect launch
placement, a massive playerbase that was eager to dump the three
mmorpgs currently in release, no significant opposition of the same
generation, DAoC managed to completely fail in drawing the numbers a
more ambitious game should have gotten (and will now get with WoW and
probably EQ2).

It's like professional sports in a way. Some teams seem to be content
in playing .500, making the playoffs but going out early, doing their
best, not making waves. They sign the favorite players back but don't
go after the big names. Think the Washington Capitals (before Jagr).
But then you get other teams that really try to build something
special. They go out, take risks, look for diamonds in the rough and
sometimes they get burned. Say Quebec/Colorado.

Personally, though no offense to fans of the Capitals, I am more
impressed with teams that take risks, even if they are burned, and
therefore I reject the idea that Mythic is somehow better at managing
their game than everyone else. They're just less ambitious.
