I don't use AIM, but if it is like some of the other instant message
services, such as ICQ, you can probably get the IP address of the person you
are talking to.  The bad guy sounds well prepared and organized, so I'd not
be surprised if he was set up to quickly check a given IP address for
several known backdoors or other security holes and exploit them.
