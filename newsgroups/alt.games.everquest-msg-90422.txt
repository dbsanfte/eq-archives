Perhaps that goes to show that Druids were unbalanced to start with... 
Not that I'm complaining. =)

Anyway, considering the amount of epic-wielding Druids I've seen (a lot 
more than any other epic except perhaps the rogue one, which I wouldn't 
know if I've seen or not, since it's not flashy), they can't be all that 
screwed in the end game... At least their guilds care enough about them 
to go to the trouble of getting them their epics.
