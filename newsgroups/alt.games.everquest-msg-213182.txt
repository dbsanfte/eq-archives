Annie,

The media has always been hot to paint ANYTHING with the color of evil
when it suits them, especially when it can be sensational.

I don't know if you are old enough to remember the anti-Dungeons and
Dragons furvor of the 80's -- I am, because I actually was playing
then :)  The media behaved the same way then as they do now.  Someone
would kill themselves, or someone else, and among their effects would
be some D&D books -- WHAM!  The media would immediately begin drawing
parallels between roleplaying and being an unstable threat to society.

Of course, Jaffe's "Mazes and Monsters" book and movie (with Tom
Hanks, btw) didn't help matters any.

The US in general as a society has been edging farther and farther
away from personal responsibility for decades now, and it is only
getting worse.  No one, or very few, will actually cite personal
responsibility, because that involves personal change and work.  Far,
far easier to cite some external threat or influence, one that can be
labeled "evil" and lobbied against in some fashion.  It makes people
feel better because they can say "It's not my fault, it was item X." 
Now they feel better about themselves -- no reason to change, no
responsibility to alter their habits.

It's like the legislation against cigarettes, or alcohol, or proposed
legislation against gun manufacturers or fast food producers.  Far,
far easier to blame someone else than to look into the mirror and
blame yourself.  Especially since for some thirty years now (or more),
the detrimental effects of cigarettes and alcohol have been well known
and widely circulated (when I was in kindergarten, the items we were
told about cigarettes had me in tears when I got home -- almost
everyone in my family used to smoke, I guess I thought they were going
to drop dead on the spot :) -- they all quit in short order for my and
my brother's sake, but the information was already there to be
taught).

Hell, I'm pretty overweight.  Always have been, always probably will
be (it's also in the family), but not once have I considered it to be
McDonalds' fault, or Frito-Lay, or anyone else.  Sure, maybe there's a
little bad genetics in there, but sueing someone, or blaming them
isn't going to change it.  I work as I can to cut down, because at the
end of the day, it's MY problem -- sure, maybe not 100% my fault, but
still, the buck stops in front of me, no one else.

No one put a gun to this woman's head and made her play Everquest
anymore than Ronald McDonald jammed French Fries down my throat :)

But in today's easy fix, litigious society, far easier to blame the
faceless corporations than to look in the mirror and accept blame.

I apologize for the rant.  It's just something that always gets me --
the GAME/BOOK/FOOD made me do it!

And for all that?  I love Everquest.

And McDonalds food -- but not enough to leave a child in a car, or
ignore the house burning around me.

Take it and run.
