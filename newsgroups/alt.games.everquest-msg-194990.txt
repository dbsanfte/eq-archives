Aha, first confirmation of where in Cab they really are.  I explored this
possibility some, even found a spell vendor down in there, but he didn't seem to
have Sicken which is what I was looking for.  I probably gave up too soon.

Others just said "in the shaman guild" or "in the grotto" (which is the little band
of necro spell salesmen near the arena)

I'll have to look this guy up, since I imagine there are going to be more spells as
I level up that can't be found anywhere normal

Forssake
