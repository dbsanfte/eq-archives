Did you do your citizen quest? there are special quests that you have to do,
I think you can't get your epic unless you do them,  all starts at level 1.
Some new kitties don't have to fight anything at level 1, they ding 2 just
on the handins for the citizen quest.  My cat BL only had to kill one thing
to ding 2, it was cool.
Many things in pit and shadeweaver and hollowshade are for the class
specific quests.  Good luck.
