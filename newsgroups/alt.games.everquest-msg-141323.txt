First, buy yourself a mini-fridge to go next to the computer.  Then pick 
up a nice high-quality catheter.  Buy the best chair money can buy.  
Sounds expensive, sure, but you can sell your bed and couch and chairs 
to afford it, you won't be needing those anymore.  Oh, and if your 
computer desk doesn't have room to fit meals at it, get yourself a new 
one.  If you don't have a phone near the computer, get one.  Not a 
cordless, they start to go dead every so often and you end up having to 
go put them back in the holder, then go grab it every time it rings (you 
could just ignore the phone if it weren't for things like Ragefire, but 
noooo...)  If you have a girlfriend (or boyfriend of course), bribe 
someone to 'steal' her (him) from you.  Trust me, she'll (he'll) only 
cause problems later.  Finally, phone up your boss and tell him or her 
you quit.  You only need $12 per month to play, so selling blood will 
more than cover the cost, and if you grow your hair reeeeeeally long, 
you can sometimes sell that, too.  Try and arrange to have them pick it 
up at your house.  If you live in a small, superstitious town, convince 
them you're a witch.  You'll find small foodstuffs as presents lying on 
your doorstep, and no small children will play around your house and 
distract you at the crucial moment.  Buy yourself two or three female 
cats capable of breeding and install a pet door.  Cats are *always* 
getting knocked up, so you'll have a fairly constant food supply.  I 
suggest making a dark place with a nice nest fairly close to the 
computer for easy access.  Oh, and if you do find the odd child playing 
around your house, you can always trap it and lock it in a room to make 
wallets.  This means you have to get up every so often though, and if 
you plan on making it a long-term operation, you'll have to share your 
kittens.  You can also cut a hole in your roof, insert a drain, and 
connect it to a rainwater barrel by your computer.  Tap it with a brita 
and you've got your drink (although beer, if attainable, is always a 
good addition).

At the moment I'm trying to get the guys from the Red Green Show hooked 
on EQ.  After that, this guide should expand considerably.

Until then, remember that you'll also need to buy EQ (take my advice and 
just buy the trilogy deal straight off) and, if you don't have a credit 
card available to pay the monthly fee with, you'll need to find a place 
that sells the time cards.
