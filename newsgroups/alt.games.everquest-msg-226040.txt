We did a 20 fang collection from Butcherblock last night and had finished
with 25 mins to spare, went on to clear way to 2 more bosses and probably
saw another 8 fangs drop on the way. This was with a group of avg level 52.
( As a side note, be sure who you have as a main looter, ours conveniently
went LD 2 mins after completing collection and never made it back, probably
carrying 1500 plats worth of gems alone )
