I never said it wasnt a viable solution, hey biz, heres another viable
solution : do the damn ports.  Its not my fault hes bound in some esoteric
location on the moon and doesnt want to change his bind just like its not
his fault every melee doesnt have a thurg gate potion.  Id like to see a
raid where every melee had a gate potion, show me one please? Your living in
candyland.

Let's see, make all melee master a trade skill to make a gate potion so some
loser druid can feel good about abandoning a raid because he doesn't want to
change his bind location?  Thats funny, I mean really funny.

> You're the "idiot melee" he's talking about.

Oh wow, my ego is crushed.  Sorry but I know my role on a raid, I know my
part in the whole, I tank, I taunt I die.  He needs to realize that one of
his reasons for being on a raid is to help with ports out, evacs, etc.
Cause you know druids are the best healers, the best buffers, have the best
resists, can nuke the hardest. Screw that transport ability, that cant
possibly be one of the reasons for having a druid or a wizard on a raid.

Maybe in the future this druid should announce at the beginning of the raid
to the entire raid party that they will not be changing their bind point and
helping get anyone else but the 5 others he can take out.  hmm.. wonder if
that would have changed his inclusion in the raid?

Server Reputation > Bind point.  Pull an ass more like this, and you'll get
a repution of being an asshole.  This entire forum is lip service for
anonymous, post your character name, guild and level and lets discuss this
topic in EQ druids and see what the real druid community thinks about it.
