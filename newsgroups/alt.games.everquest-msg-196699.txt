Yep.  When you're right, you're right.

: You're right. It's every 10 seconds, I believe.

And situational.  i.e., Rogues wouldn't be pounding Backstab and
Evade outside of battle.  Nor would they be pounding Pick Pocket
without, well, some target to pickpocket.

You're right again.

: Obvious sarcasm representing opinion responded to obvious sarcasm 
: reflecting feigned ignorance. Productive.

And again.

Right.  And SOE keeps the bard class "in check" by making sure it
requires more attention, stamina, and dexterity compared to many
other classes.

So, in the right hands, a bard is god-like, or at least that's the
impression I'm getting.

Of course.  I think better examples could have been given, though.
But I understand the spirit of the message (and said so).

Any class that's too good can be bad.  For example, you see the
non-stop druid envy in alt.games.everquest almost daily.

I don't play a bard, and don't plan to, so it doesn't really bother
me.  It just seemed like an odd UI choice.  But I do understand the
arguments people are putting forth: bards would be too powerful and/or
too popular if songs could be "auto-twisted".

You'd be wrong.  I'm interested in the mechanics of lots of classes
I've never played and don't intend to play.  Is there something wrong
with that?

As a software engineer, I'm also generically interested in user
interface designs.  Chaulk it up to curiosity and interest.
