The best way to deny port beggars is not to reply "sorry busy" or "no, I
can't right now"; but to simply ignore them, not /ignore the player, but
just pay no attention to their tells.  Saying that you're busy only opens up
avenues of abuse, most commonly the  "You're too ubber to care about us
newbies" type argument, of course my personal favorite is the  "I have a
level 59 monk and I get what I want" type argument, mostly I just tell them,
"yay, would you like a cookie?" at which point they get confused and give
up.

And believe me I get my share of port requests as a (rarely anon) 51 druid.

Then there's the guild things and you're picking up people (who you tell to
get to a druid ring)3 to drop them somewhere, and you have mr. dipshit
sitting in EC selling who tells you "come pick me up at shady, I need to go
to misty to bank first"  those people I just want to port to skyfire (unless
doing something in that area, then do WL and hope dragon is up)

And on a side note, when I do (rarely) port, I never ask for money, which
isn't to say I deny it if offered since my Jade Reaver / hopefully
soon-to-be-nerfed fungi tunic fund says: "feed me sir".
