Maybe I picked an odd combo, I don't know, but I'm currently twoboxing a
pair of Iksars as a Necro and Monk.  It's working out very well.

The idea was minimal down time and so far it's worked.  The Necro heals plus
a safty Mend are good enough to handle the lower HP damage Monks tend to
take and use no real mana.  Iksar regen keeps it from killing the Necro, and
the skeleton can take quite well if the Monk gets too low and needs to
FD/bandage for a bit.  If I keep everything balanced well (which isn't too
hard) I have effectively zero downtime.  The dots and pet can finish off the
last mob(s) of a pull while the Monk goes off to grab more.

I don't get any real buffs (Impart Str and Spirt Armor), but necros get some
very nice debuffs and debuff-dots.  I actually however, consider lack of
buffs to be a plus... There is nothing I hate more about computer RPGs, and
especially in EQ, then buffing.  In even small groups, it's nearly a full
time job just keeping all buffs up...by the time you've all got your buffs
up, the first buffs cast are about to end and the wicked cycle repeats.

Intimidation means fear kiting the living takes less mana.  Sneek means I
can sell most anywhere.  FD and Screaming Terror means I can pull from
pretty much anything.  Both chars able to FD means death is extremely rare,
even from trains and over pulls. -The pet makes a great distraction while
both chars get off solid FDs.  If I do somehow die, the necro can easily
grab the corpses.

So far I like it a lot.  Necros are probably second only to Enchanter so far
as interesting tactical play goes, and Monks are pretty high on the list of
tactical tank classes (Warriors are nice dressup dolls, but my god they are
boring to actually play), and between the two there's a ton of ways I can
play any given situation.

I will say however, that the few times a shaman has passed by and buffed us
it's been insane...  I can really see why shaman/monk is often stated.  If I
was to add a 3rd to my group, I'd make a shaman in a second...even if I do
hate buffing. :-)
