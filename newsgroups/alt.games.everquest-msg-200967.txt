Norm;

Thanks very much for that info. I kept mulling it over in my mind, like, if
I put more memory in, just HOW would it help EQ, if any. Unless EQ was
written to always use all available memory, I couldn't come up with
anything, hence, posting here.

Thanks Norm for saving me some money and frustration.
