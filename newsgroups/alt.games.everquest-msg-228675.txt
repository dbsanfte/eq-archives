Heh, SOE/Verant has never been known for an soft approach when it
comes to nerfs. ... see monks.

Not sure Rangers are a good comparison, at least what I've seen on my
lvl 50 ranger and he's reasonably twinked. His damage just isn't that
impressive <shrug>. Rogues and monks otoh, seem to be a different
story. I pulled a 53 lvl monk out of retirement the other day to group
with some friends, including a 56 rogue. Even without epics, those two
put out an amazing amount of damage but I don't think that most other
melees have access to relatively cheap (12k) 14/20 weapons.

Raids bore me so I rarely do any, it's not something I feel qualified
to discuss.
