Actually, the one time we did this the final quest rewards we
got were all/all, not class-specific.  But they were indeed No Drop.
What's interesting is that the "RNG" quest piece resulted in a
one-charge item that cast Firefist, a Ranger spell.  This is
useless for a Ranger (they can cast it themselves easily enough),
but might be amusing for a *non*Ranger to acquire.  Perhaps some
of the rewards might allow a non-XXX class character to acquire
an ability (albeit *once*) which would not otherwise be possible
for them.

But since most of the town got wiped out, we may have gotten
the booby-prizes.  I'm not sure if the higher-level rewards
might be class-specific or not.
