From the shadows, the mysterious Shrom <Shrom@baenom.com> (if that IS
his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

This is pretty much right. What you decide to do or don't do reflects
on your character, but no one is obligated to do anything they don't
want to, period. Just make your decisions on how you regard people's
behavior, don't insist they are wrong to act in a way differently than
you prefer.

I'd rez someone in group if they died in the interest of the group no
matter how big an asshole they were. If they seemed to be acting
against the group, though, I might consider refusing. I'm not here to
coddle babies.
