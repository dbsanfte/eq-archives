Crown of King Tranix is popular (Infravision.)  And the
Stained Cloth Mask (Ultravision, 10 charges) is okay.
A Glowing Stone Band is a handy choice for lower levels
or for a bank item so they can get back to their corpse.
Or it's okay for, as you mention, simply getting through
the DL tunnel.

Then there's items which are light sources, of course.
Foreman's Skull Cap is okay for that and passable, if a
bit heavy, if you're not willing to invest in a Crown of
King Tranix.

Or simply carry a Greater Lightstone in inventory.
