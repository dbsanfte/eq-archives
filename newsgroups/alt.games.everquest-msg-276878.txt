my feelings and memories of EQ1.....wow...a lot has changed over the years.
i started playing a bit after kunark came out.  some RL friends played, and 
they got me into it.  for probably the 1st year at least, probably more, i 
knew next to nothing about the game i was playing. i was having fun, but i 
had no concept of class strategy, game goals, etc etc.  it was all about 
leveling and gear to me.  still fun, but if i knew then what i know now, i 
probably would have had a much better time.
as i said, i was playing with real life friends in our guild until about lvl 
30, still having fun, but slowly getting more and more addicted to the game.
the guild disbanded, i kept leveling, tried some small guilds, made more 
friends.  finally learned how to play my class well.  by the 40s and 50s i 
was very addicted, spending long hours grinding, still having fun, but not 
as much.
took a break and came back.
joined a large raiding family guild.  continued leveling up, back to more 
fun now that i had lots of people around to group with.
the PoP came out.  flagged zones ruined that expansion, and for me the game. 
it took forever to get flagged.  spent frustrating hours trying to help 
friends get flagged, trying to play catchup.  raids turned from fun 
adventures to all day clusterf*cks.  for soem reason we lost the ability 
form up in any reasonable amount of time, people refused to shor up on time, 
etc etc.  it just didnt seem fun to spend literally hours to go thru a zone 
just to kill 1 mob.
ended up quitting.
came back about 8 months later at the request of a friend who wanted help 
getting his epic.  came back, bought LDoN, and having some fun with that. 
but the high level game just burned me out quickly again.  LDoNs after lvl 
66 just sucked.  the exp was horrible, and the adventure points per session 
dropped way down.  and since the items i was saving points far just seemed 
further and further out of reach now, and the exp sucked, there wasnt much 
incentive.  i would log in, sit LFG for over an hour, an then log off just 
straigh pissed off.  at that point there was virtually no solo content for a 
ranger, there were items id sit and camp (if i could get the group), and the 
straw that broke my back was when a guildie cock blocked my group, and ended 
up getting the item i wanted in like 20 minutes  (i.e. if they had not set 
up shop 10 feet in front of us and pulled the mob, my...who knows how many 
hours wasted in that zone would actually have paid off).
frustation in time wasted camping, frustration that raids we no longer fun, 
and frustration that there werent groups to be had finally drove me away for 
good.  i tried creating alts, but it was similar problems.  at least on 
prexus, it just seemed that people created alts only to power level them up 
as quickly as possible, which is not what i wanted to do the 2nd time 
around.
so for about 6 months i was totally done with online games, until a friend 
(yes one of the original group that go me into EQ1) bought me a copy of EQ2, 
and most of hte original group set aside time on the weekends to play.  its 
a lot of fun, and its fixed a lot of the problems of the original, but im 
already tiring a bit.

not sure if thats what you wanted, but thats my story!  :)
