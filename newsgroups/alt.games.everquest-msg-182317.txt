Also something noone yet has mentioned is what spells to use for snaring.
As you said you are a Wizard you will get a snare spell at lvl 29 called
Bonds of Force
and at lvl 51 one called Atol Spectral Shackles which are both EA (Area
Effect) spells.

Use those for making the MOB (Mobile OBject, or monster if you like to call
it that) walk slower.
And then cast away with, as you put it, you biggest baddest nuke spells.

Druids and Rangers get a series of snaring spells of their own that have a
little clearer name that actually tells you it is a spell for snaring
something, IE: Snare, Ensnare etc.
