You mean this plasma TV can show more than 500 or so lines ?

I'd rather play EQ with 1600*1200 resolution on my 19 inches monitor than
640*480 on my 32 inches TV.
How would you scramble all the windows in a 640*480 resolution ? Think of
the text !

TV is great for action games, like car races, but really sucks for text
intensive games, like EQ.
