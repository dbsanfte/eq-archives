    I definitely meant "shaman". Wonder what I was on. For the record the 65
is a barbarian, and the other is a frog.

    Actually having looked the damn thing up [this is what I get for not
having a shammy character and commenting on it ;)] it's more like +25 DPS.

    I can see how it might depend on the group, with the small groups I'm
usually in, I rarely see a cleric - so shammy tends to be main healer. They
also tend to be melee heavy, as most groups seem to be these days, which
means shammies spend an inordinate amount of mana on buffs. The third thing
that springs to mind is dotting. Shammy dots could easily eat into 25 DPS
and leave time for canni-ing and other shammy functions. In that group
situation I can see the JBB achieving very little and creating downtime.
Maybe it's very different for soloing, but I can't comment on that.

    For a larger group of 60's +25DPS will go unnoticed, and the odds are
you're working with say 4 melees plus pets, and short fights. You probably
wont have mana to dot even if there was time. In that sort of group shammies
seem to spend all their time buffing, slowing, rooting adds or canni-ing up
the mana to keep those things going.

    I'm not sure I was trying to put it to bed, as such, especially
considering I don't actually HAVE a shaman character, just offering what
information I had. Having said that now I've waded in with figures and
opinions etc <sigh> can't help myself.
