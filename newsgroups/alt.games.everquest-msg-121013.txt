Eh, didn't bother me *that* much since I can port myself to either IC or
GD in the time it takes to mem the spell. The bard sitting on the docks
with me who found out the same thing was a bit less amused, of course.
Fortunately for him, I showed up having run into the exact same
horsehockey (so I knew it wasn't a BS story to get a free port) and I
took him to GD with me.
