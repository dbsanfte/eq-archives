Umm, the start of a well thought out post?

> low frame rates, crappy looking character models

Yeah, buggy as well but these will be fixed. Models are too cartoon like for
me, I turned the Erudite one off, they used to look dignified now they look
like freaks. The graphics themselves are great but they haven't been very
conservative, Plate breastplates actually sit over chain vests, realistic?
Yes. Nice to look at? Great. Economical, erm...nope. Still you can turn them
all off if you don't like them and the frame rates and loading times improve
dramatically.

> why did they have to change anything, i liked my EQ just the way it was.

Because the engine needed it. It ran like shit on my PC, until the DX8.1
patch anyway. My PC pulls 120fps on timedemo on Q3 with everything cranked
up but in some places in EQ it seemed to struggle, now, when it is
struggling I know why and know that I may need to turn something down.
Least it looks good (objectively) for the loss of frame rate, except in
lower guk the other night but that got fixed :ï¿½).

> now the game runs like a pile of fecal matter.

Now the game needs a powerful PC to run, this has hurt a lot of the player
base. Not everyone can afford a new PC of the spec required and a lot of
good people will be lost to other games. DAoC for example has a lower spec
than SoL and looks just as good (graphics aren't as fancy, textures aren't
as detailed but everything is better drawn and not so cartoon like)

Well I guess we'll be losing you too (maybe SoL has more good points than I
thought)

Missing you already,
