Not really a waste. Its just a game. What difference does it make
what level you are playing as long as you are playing. Personally
I have fun with all my characters.

Its not like the game is a race or you get a prize at the end. Its all
just electrons moving around and magnetic signatures. All the characters
are going to be gone some day anyway.

You said it, if you're not having fun you are doing it wrong. =)
