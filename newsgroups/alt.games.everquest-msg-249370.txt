I'm not sure I know what Ben means but there is a thing that hopefully
will bring people back into towns. And this is two fold. For one
blizzard utilized fatigue. :) No, not you but your avatar. It will
become tired when not rested and this has a direct impact on the
experience gained. So a well rested char will gain experience faster
then a fatigued one. To actually rest you have to be in an inn if I
understand the faq correctly. Don't get me wrong. You still can grind
exp if you want. Your char won't keel over. ;) But experience gained
will be reduced. 
The second thing is the heartstone. It is free and will be given to a
char by the bar keeper at an inn. Activating it is like a gate to
nearest town. It can only be activated once per hour realtime. And has a
rather long casting time. So it can not be used as escape or short cut
for shopping.
Both added together should keep towns as meeting place. Be it in the
start of a session when you log in or be it in the end when people
return to town and just chill out. At least in theory I find this a
fantastic concept. :)
