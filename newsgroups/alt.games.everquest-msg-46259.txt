While I'm not disagreeing with your assessment that we will be attacked
again, and possibly by chemical and/or biological agents I have to ask one
thing.  Where do you live?

You are dispensing this advice as if every man, woman, and child in the
United States is vulnerable. That is, in fact, far from true.

This is especially true for chemical attacks. If you don't live in DC, New
York, Boston, Chicago, Atlanta, or Los Angeles. (i.e. a major city) I
wouldn't be too concerned with a chemical attack.  The chance of Sioux City,
Iowa getting chem'd are pretty low I'd say.

Biological vectors can of course spread much farther, but again, major
cities will be the initial targets, though the vector can migrate to smaller
areas quickly. This is clearly more of a risk, but again, people living in
Nantucket Falls, Wisconsin, should they go buy NBC suits and biochem gear? I
doubt it...

There is a difference between being prepared and being alarmist. You are
leaning toward the latter.

Also, one thing I'd like to point out, not that it would help the poor
bastards who were victims of the attack. But if the United States was
attacked with a weapon of mass destruction like chemical or biological
agents, I can say with almost 100% certainty that the gloves would come off
and you'd see nuclear hellfire unleashed on whoever we decided was the
perpetrator of the act.  I do not think the US would roll over and die
without returning the favor by an order of magnitude.
