Before anyone takes up an offer to buy or sell a character or equipment
from these people, ask yourself if you feel confident that these people
are not trying to scam you in some way.

They have already proven that they are prepared to just ignore the
terms and conditions of agreements they make - So you'd have to be
pretty stupid to risk that they wouldn't do the same to you. My feeling
is that someone who would break a legally binding agreement just
so they can cheat in a *game* is likely to be even less honest
when it comes to a fair deal on *real money*.
