Giggling maniacally and surrounded by armed hamsters,

conspiratorially whispered:

How many ages exactly? Seriously though porting into WL is not the
best way to test your CoV faction. Go to CS, see if the monsters there
on CoV like you or not.

Really easy. Once you do it once you won't forget the way, and its not
all that far. There aren't any see invis giants along the way.


>Anyone know of any GOOD guide to playing there? 

I spent a lot of time there, first when leveling my druid to 60 many
many moons ago, and later when picking up panther pelts. But neither
would be much use to you. The armors are poor experience for people in
your level range, I would think... you would be run dry trying to kite
them unless you had KEI (maybe C2) and you sure wouldn't want the
ranger tanking them.

There's animals here. Some would even be dark blue to you. But believe
me panther fighting is kinda rowdy. First of all, they're fast.
Secondly, they're bloody hard to see. Thirdly, the haze panthers
aren't just hard to see, sometimes they're literally invisible. They
also have some insanely high MR; even my L60 had some tough times
pushing snare through on them, though that was before the MR changes.
Both kinds of panthers are universal KOS. Fourth, most of them are
hanging fairly near the center of the zone. When you looked at Alla's,
did you notice the Corrputed mobs listed there? That's where several
of THOSE hang out too, and they are way out of your league. The
corrupted faun or panther aggro was an automatic zoneout for me at 60.

There's another animal option - tigeraptors. You could pulverize them
with your ranger friend, but I don't know if they'd still be blue or
not. At least they hang out along the edge of the zone (near
Skyshrine), so you don't have the problems you do with in the middle.

What else? Lots of giants. You could probably kill those all day but
there's not much point to killing these over those elsewhere when you
don't have any healing around to kill the stronger ones. Watch out for
named, some of them are high enough to summon.

Holgreshes are another wandering universal KOS that are hard to see.
Unlike the panthers they are casters; some even have pets. Some people
like to kill em, I found them to just be nuisances. They have jack for
hp though, and go down hard.

There's geonids here. I never killed them.

Other than that, just remember to keep an eye open. The forest
restricts visibility and there's some real nasty baddies out there,
like the Corrupted unicorn (and others), Rolandal or something along
the wall (a dragon though, so you might be okay), three wandering
named giants, etc etc.
