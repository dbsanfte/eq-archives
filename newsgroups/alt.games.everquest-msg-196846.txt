It's situational with a bard as well. The difference is that the bard has 
more situations. It is very much a support class in addition to 
everything else. There is always something to do if you *want* to stay 
busy. Some bards end a fight, fire up their mana song and leave it at 
that. The ones that want to go the extra mile and make the biggest 
contribution possible will twist during most downtime as well.

It is certainly different from all other classes, to be sure.

Nope. It was just a notion that occurred to me as I wrote, that's all.
