Once you make the final decision on alignment (at 20?)
that's it.   You can't change your mind after that and you
can't work faction up to beyond KOS.   EQ2 also has

city are closed to non-citizens.  There ARE guards in
there so I'm not sure the "lock" applies to citizens of
the other city, but...
