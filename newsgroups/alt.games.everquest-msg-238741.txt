Is that an actual method to get down there?  Never thought of that.. does
divine aura last through zoning?  I mean, it's a buff, so I would assume it
does, but the hole auto-strips levitation, so I thought it would do that to
other buffs as well.  Interesting idea.

On a side note, what server are you on, Merlin?  If you haven't gotten your
body back, I'm on Tarew Marr.. on the off chance that you are on my server,
let me know and I'll help you get it.
