   No, they shouldn't be.  But being able to say 
"bind my soul" to the right NPC?  Righteous.
     Ok, I admit, I never under the binding thing.
I don't see why melees and hybrids can't be bound
anywhere casters can be.  I'm sure that there are
plenty of good argument for, game balance, or
something, but to me, it just seems like a pain in 
the ass.  Especially since casters are generally
more powerful than the other types are.

Annie  <--- Does think that the death exp penalty
            is a GOOD idea, though.
