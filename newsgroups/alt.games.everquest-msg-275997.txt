So, what does the panel think of the first adventure pack? Can't say
I'm too impressed. That's probably because the website doesn't do
a very good job in selling it. Just seems like every other instance to
me. Might have new creatures, items and lore but there's tons of
content I've not done yet so I don't fell the need to get this.

But the real blocker is that it's for 30-45 and my highest level char
is 23. So, there's not much point in getting it anyway!
