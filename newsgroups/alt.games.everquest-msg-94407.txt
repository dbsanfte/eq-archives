You could try Kith > HHP > EK.  It's a bit shorter in terms of zone times,
but I suppose you might need an escort through HHP as it's a bit confusing
the first dozen or so times through :)

At level 4 it is a bit risky to try make that run, though.  I'd leave
everything in the bank just in case you die.  Also try to get bound in any
suitable zones (i.e. anywhere in Rivervale or HHP, depending on the route
you take).   That way, you don't have to restart the entire journey should a
crag spider or gorge hound take a shine to your level 4 booty :)

If you're on the Seventh Hammer, gimme a tell.  I'll bring you some of the
way.
