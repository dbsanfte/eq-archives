I declined to allow a transaction that wasn't authorized to go through. 
If they'd bothered to ask for authorization perhaps I wouldn't have 
disputed it.

When I pay for groceries I take the currency out of my wallet and hand 
it to the cashier, they don't pickpocket my wallet for whats owed to 
them. The end result is the same, but the distinction is not slight at 
all.

Because the cashier who undercharged me for groceries by mistake should 
ask for the balance not pick my pocket for it. Its not the number of 
transactions its the way they are conducted. Ditto SOE.

Yes. I've received bills for smaller amounts from government, from 
banks, from online retailers. All of them had the sense to ask for money 
owed them instead of just helping themselves to it.

> For $2.00?

If that's what they feel I owe them. If the loss is so minor as to not 
be worth asking for, its not worth taking from me either.

Then don't do it.

The only time this sort of surreptitious billing is remotely acceptable 
is when dealing with deadbeats (e.g. the guy who rents a movie, fails to 
return it, doesn't respond to a letter in the mail, can't be reached or 
is beligerent by phone... ie a customer you no longer want!! Then, and 
only then, is it ok to ding the card for the amount owed, and deal with 
the potential risk and hassle of having him dispute it.)

You seem much too happy to let SOE take money from you at their 
convenience. Suppose your CC happens to get declined for this little 
surcharge for any reason (maxxed out, cancelled, expired, whatever). 
Would you be comfortable with SOE just withdrawing the funds directly 
from your bank account? Or perhaps just use some other credit card of 
yours which you might have used at some point in time on another Sony 
product somewhere... perhaps you bought a cable at the sony store...

If you're ok with that... Wow...
