Your idea is very intriguing but has one serious business flaw, as I see
it.  SOE boosts its bottom line by designing brand new content and
selling expansions.  The profit to be gained from revamping existing
content that is not sold as new expansions has a less obvious positive
effect (if any) on the bottom line.  The bean counters would not approve.

Of course it could be argued that expanion-itis is in part responsible
for the subscription rate drop (if indeed there is one, there *does*
however seem to be some anecdotal evidence for it).  It could also be
argued that revamping existing content would boost the bottom line in a
round-about sort of way.  Good luck convincing the bean counters of that
though.

I think almost everyone would agree with this.
