I've met some athiests who are passionate about their belief that there is
no god (a stance that has always baffled me... in the name of science, they
believe in something science cannot prove to be true).  I'm not sure it's
possible to be passionately agnostic (a stance that has always seemed much
more in line with science than atheism).
