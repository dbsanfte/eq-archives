If you're really that stuck, I have a level 29 enchanter on AB, Memnon, who 
has the spell (since I started the character to be my Wu Goo Bitch).

Send me a tell in game and I'm sure I can work something out with you. 
You're most likely to find me online as Elidar or Tiddles (my new 
Beastlord).

This would be as a favour - the sort of markup I could charge on something 
like that doesn't justify the hassle of casting the spell 80 times or 
whatever, given that I can only manage about 4 on a full bar of mana, so 
don't expect a fast turnaround. I do have him on a second account though, 
so I could just leave him sat in town and hit the cast hotkey every so 
often while I'm playing my main on my other PC...
