Damn It Feels Good To Be A Ranger


Inspired by the finest SFHE Ranger--Inion Buro, Terris Thule

With a few apologies to the Geto Boys



Damn it feels good to be a ranger 
A real ranger ass half-elf plays her cards right 
A real ranger ass half-elf never runs her fucking mouth 
Cause real ranger ass half-elfs dont start fights. 

And half-elfs don't always got a high stat 
Showing all his boys how we shot him 
But real ranger ass half-elfs dont flex nuts 
Cause real ranger ass half-elfs knows she's got 'em 

And everything's cool in the mind of a ranger 
Cause ranger ass half-elfs think deep 
Up 3-65 a yo 24-7 
Cause real ranger ass half-elfs dont sleep. 

And all I gotta say to you 
Wanna be, gonna be, fear-kiting, necromancing Dark Elves 
Is when the fire dies down 
what the fuck you going to do? 
Damn it feels good to be a ranger 

Damn it feels good to be a ranger 
Feeding newbies and helping out with their heals 
Although I was born in Kelethin 
Now I'm in the nexus making deals 

Damn it feels good to be a ranger 
I mean one that you dont really know 
Riding around town on a High-end Horse 
or Kiting mammies with my Trueshot Bow. 

Now ranger ass half-elfs come in all shapes and colors 
Some got killed in the past 
But this ranger here was a smart one 
Started living for Tunare and I last 

Now all I gotta say to you 
Wanna be, gonna be, fear-kiting, necromancing Dark Elves 
When the shit jumps off what the fuck you gonna do 
Damn it feels good to be a ranger 

Damn it feels good to be a ranger 
A real ranger ass half-elf knows the play 
The real ranger ass half-elfs get the fliest of the Armor 
Ask that ranger ass half-elf, Robenstiel 

Druids look at ranger ass half-elfs like a stop-sign 
And play the role of little Ms. Sweet 
But catch the wench all alone, get the digits, take her out 
And end up tanking for her ass like some lame meat. 

Cause ranger ass half-elfs be the game players 
And everything's quiet in the clique 
A ranger ass half-elf flexes her bow 
And members of the guild aint talkin no shit 

Real ranger ass half-elfs dont talk much 
All you hear is a twanged strung bow
And real ranger ass half-elfs dont run from shit 
Because real ranger ass half-elfs ain't all show. 

Now when you and the Goon are talking shit, you the shit 
Try to run and let the motherfucker shank ya 
But half-elfs like myself just know to fucking stay away 
Damn it feels good to be a ranger. 

Now a word from Inion Buro: 

Damn it feels good to be a ranger 
Would like to get into Sister's Seraphim, boss. 
Everything looking good for the ladies of the world 
Having no guys in there sho ain't no loss.

So every now and then I owe a favor getting there 
Like getting a big new uber shipment through 
And stash them away in an empty newbie town 
So we can twink another you know who. 

So Clerics of the world keep on buffing me 
And I promise I'll track for you fair and far 
Other half-elfs better not upset me 
Or I'll pretend they're just another Iksar.

So all you Wood-Elf Druids that helped me to win 
I'd sincerely like to thank you 
Cause now I got the world swinging from my bow
Damn it feels good to be a ranger.


--Cirocco Jones, Druid and Robenstiel, Ranger


ps.... if you can't figure out how you can cut someone down with the same 
word you use for yourself..... ahmmm, listen to the song or don't worry 
about it! hehe.

and please, collaborate and make it better if you can!
