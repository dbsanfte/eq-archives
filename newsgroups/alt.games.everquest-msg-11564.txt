Also you need the high Int of a Enchanter to learn the skill quickly so lose
less on fails. I dont charge to enchant silver or electrum as it takes
hardly any mana, just a little time, gold takes a lot of mana and
platnium/velium takes a few medding sessions to enchant a stack so you pay
for the time of the enchanter.
