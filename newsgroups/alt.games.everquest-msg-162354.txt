locust1m@bellsouth.net (Mark A. Rimer) done spake :

>their body back yet ("Yes, out of
>41 people your corpse is at the

*shifts the universe 2 ticks to port*

While we are on the subject...

I had been playing my warrior all day, when I got a tell from some fun 
guildies.  They wanted to check out a zone they didn't know.  I'm always up for 
that, of course.

We decided the try The Hole.  41 Chanter, 53 Ranger, 51 Druid.  Had a blast, 
then added 53 Pally and 49 Cleric and went to town on all the mobs down to the 
bridg-guarding Golem.

We moved down to the Golem and pulled the 2 at the bridge, the wanderer, and 
the 2 guards behind us for a few rotations.  After we knew we had that down, we 
decided to start grabbing some of the ones closer the the front.  We pulled the 
2 that guard the first set of stairs down past the second set of stairs into 
that corner.  We were doing fine, I was able to mez the reds ( amen ), and then 
I notice the Pally has his back turned to the one they are currently bashing 
on.  Then, the Druid says the Ranger is going LD ( they were in the same house 
).  3 seconds later, the druid, ranger, and pally all go LD, while the Cleric 
and I are fine.  I tell the cleric I have one mezzed and am mezzing the other 
( while the LD guys are beating on it ).  It mezzes, I tell the cleric "It's 
mezzed, I'm running out", hoping I can make it by the 6 guys up at the front.

I take off, and almost make it - about 3 ft from the zone line.  I end up in 
PoK and then it hits me "Uh, dumbass, why didn't you gate?"  Yeah, real 
genious, here.  Played the warrior too much that day.

I send a gsay to the cleric telling him I'm OMW, and tell him about the non-
gate.  He tells me he sat down to Mem gate as soon as they went LD, but after I 
told him the 2nd was mezzedand I'm running out, he hit DA and ran out too, 
forgetting about his gate.  Must have been in the air that night.

Anyway, my goal was to have the 2 guys mezzed long enough that the LD guys 
would get logged out but we weren't sure if they made it.  I ran to The Hole, 
camped, and made a Brell worshipping Halfling Rogue and ran him there.  I went 
in and used Sneak/Hide and saw that there were no corpses ( at least THAT part 
of the plan worked ).

Here's my question: Did I need to use Sneak/Hide in The Hole or is being a 
Brell worshipper enough to get by?

It was also interesting that the LD guys didn't keep fighting the guy after I 
mezzed him.  Has this always been the case, or was that changed when they 
stopped pets from attacking Mezzed opponants?

Got two loam items while I was in there, and one was a decent upgrade for me.  
Woohoo!

More questions.  It was past time to log, but I snuck/sneaked my Brell-lover 
around The Hole for about 10 minutes.  What's the story on this place?  Is it a 
town that sunk into the ground or something?
