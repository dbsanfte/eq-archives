Why do you feel that a "need for recognition" is somehow pathological? I 
think it's a perfectly natural thing, and a consequence of how our brains 
are wired. Of course, taken too far, it can be pathological, but I don't 
think that shouting Ding! is nuthouse material, exactly.

From the Nobel prizes to the "employee of the month" awards, the need for 
recognition is pretty much one of the things that keeps society moving...
