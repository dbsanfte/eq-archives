There's something else in this that you're missing - CBM didn't
invent the Amiga.  The developers of the Amiga originally went
to Jack Tramiel (the founder of CBM who was then running Atari)
to try and sell it to him.  With no joy there, that's when they
went to CBM to sell it.

The A1000 shared nothing besides a parent company with CBM.
