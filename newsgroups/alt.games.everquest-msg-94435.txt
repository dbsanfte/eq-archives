Well

I suppose I better thank some of you for you ignorant replies.

Yes I am a new EQ player , and didnt know about the PATCH day problems
or that the server info could be found on the website  (I looked and found
nothing)

Not everyone has been playing this game since day one  (mores the pity)
so how about a little more tact from some of you OLD hands ???
