This is correct.  I spent a very frustrating hour explaining to
someone how to use the Magus and going through all the possible
explanations of why it wasn't working for him only to discover he
didn't have the stone (and had no clue how to get one) and this was
why the Magus was blanking him.

He'd been on a dozen LDoN missions which was why it didn't occur to us
straight away this was the problem.
