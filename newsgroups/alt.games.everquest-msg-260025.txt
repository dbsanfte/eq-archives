CoH does #3. XP earned is based on % of damage done, and "credit" for a 
kill goes to whoever does at least 25% of the target's total HP (teams 
are considered one person for these kinds of calculations). Yes, this 
means more than one party can get credit for a kill, but it's not like 
that breaks the game.

It's very difficult to actually KS in CoH. At most you can snag some XP 
for the kill, but only in proportion to your contribution to the kill.
