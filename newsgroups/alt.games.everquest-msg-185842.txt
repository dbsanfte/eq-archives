Only gets you a rez if you fell for 20K due to a BUG, Einstein.

>Because I'm in a small guild where the

See above.

Did you inform the GM of WHY you fell for 20k? Were you talking to a
GM or a *GUIDE*?

Read the fucking rules of the game, jackass, and stop wasting the GMs'
time on your own stupidity.
