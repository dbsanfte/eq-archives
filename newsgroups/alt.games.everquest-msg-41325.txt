And this from a fool who said quit posting about the terrorists.

I found some quatrains!

"In the year of the new century and nine months and one day
From the suburbs will come a great King of Trolls
The NG will burn at 45 degrees C
fire approaches the great newsgroup in the A.G.EQ there will be great complaining
An Orclike one torn apart by top posting
While the sarnak fortress endures
The great troller will hit puberty
The giant flame was will engulf him and make him wish he had a girlfriend"
 ~Nostradumbass (2001
