I have an easy way out when a lowbie runs up with a (green to me)(red to
them) mob and begs for help.

I charm it.

It's now off of them, guaranteed or your money back.  And when charm breaks,
I can usually finish it with a single nuke - even an enchanter nuke.  Of
course, since charm wipes all memory and takes everyone off the hatelist
but the enchanter, they get no XP and I loot the corpse.

If they complain - you needed a rescue, right?  One rescue, hot off the
grill - beggars can't cavil at the manner of the rescue.

It seldom takes more than one or two of these episodes for lowbies to go
find someone else to beg.
