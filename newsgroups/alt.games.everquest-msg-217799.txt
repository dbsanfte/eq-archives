I'm hope I don't sound too self-congratulating, but... I did it, all by
myself, with my 49 paladin and no one else, with Phinny and his guards up.

What I did was to buy a bunch of invis potions and a couple of
water-breathing potions.  I also studied the maps on eqatlas.com, since I
had only been in the zone a couple of times before and had always been
CotH'd to Phinny's room.  I had the maps up in one window and kept
alt-tabbing back and forth between the map and EQ.

So I invis'd myself and made my way to Phinny's room, managing to get lost
only once.  Nothing sees invis until you get to Phinny's room.  I hugged the
walls until I was right above where the bone spawns, then crept forward
until I could see the drop-down.  Perhaps I just got lucky, but the guard
below me also did not see invis.  So I dropped down, again hugging the wall
and staying as far away from the center of the room as possible.  I snuck up
on the bone and grabbed it.  Then, not wanting to risk trying to get back, I
hugged the wall and used a gate potion.

It worked.  With just a little prep and a little luck, I was able to get the
finger bone in ten minutes, all by my lonesome.  And there was a bit of luck
involved - no inconvenient dropping of invis anywhere along the way.  It did
drop while I was in Phinny's room while I was hugging the wall above the
drop-off, but I had another invis potion in an open inventory slot and
right-clicked it to get invis back right away.

Admittedly, I felt somewhat safe doing all this because I had Monual
available to go on a Corpse Run for me - he's done it before, dragging
Marrtuk's corpse out of Dulak's Harbor.  If a failed run is going to cause
you too many problems, then safest is to get a good group to escort you down
there, or wait for a Phinny raid and try to tag along.

But if you're adventurous and willing to take a bit of a risk, you *can* do
it by yourself with the help of a few potions.
