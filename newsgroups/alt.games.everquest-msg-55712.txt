The thing is, even Earthlink/Mindspring does everything AOL does
better, faster, and cheaper. ~$28/month for AOL's half-assed service
is unacceptable when other, better ISPs offer the same for ~$20 or
less. EVERYTHING, all the neat little corners, info boards, etc can be
found on the web without AOL, and the ones on the web tend to be more
informative than AOHell's. Problem is, you actually have to *GASP!*
think instead of just click a single button or type in a single word
and be whisked there. Need a chat room? IRC. Need a news site?
CNN.com. Need a message board? Usenet. Countless web boards. Need a
place to shop online? Enter "shopping" in www.yahoo.com.

You see, if AOL designed their software and configured their service
RIGHT, then they wouldn't have to design it specially to work with
every single program out there. It would work with them by default.
Again, it's not the "eq boys"'s job to fix *AOL*'s fuck-ups.
