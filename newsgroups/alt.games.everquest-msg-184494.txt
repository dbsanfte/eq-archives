Probably several different ways.

Damage shield.

If a mob hits you while you have a damage shield up, you have a chance to
gain an offence point.   For at least a part of his PL'ing, a druid (or
possibly magebot) was giving him a damage shield while he killed things.
It meshes pretty well with the high defense skill as well.   Defense goes up
fast with multiple things beating on you.

He wouldn't gain offense once it ended...  at 177, thats pretty damn close
to 40 for a cleric, I believe.    At 40 you could group with 60, and just
have the 60 annilate things.

He only needs to do 1 point of damage.

At the end, I'm sure this was the case.   Someone said that by the low to
mid 50's, the cleric was "exping" in Crypt of Decay.  From the moment he was
able to enter there, the fastest exp would be to just park him afk in the
corner, while a full group (other than him) did exp killing there.   It's
one of the best zones for that (I hear)...   even in a group, with a Tier 2
exp bonus, with the level bonus from killing level 6X mobs, a low 50's
cleric would make an insane amount of experience.
