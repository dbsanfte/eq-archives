Before I ask this I'd just like to say that I understand the evils of
powerleveling, the impact on offensive and defensive skills, and the fact
that I won't be able to play this class to the best of my ability. All that
aside, our small guild is in dire need of a rez capable cleric, and my
second account got volunteered for the job. Since it's only going to be used
in guild groups with people that understand the situation, my play style
shouldn't hurt anyone that doesn't know what they're getting into.

So, I guess I'm asking for advice on how the PL her to about 30, at which
time she can get into XP groups with other guild members. She's level 12
right now, and Najena is about ot outlive it's usefullness as far as
powerleveling with FD is concerned. What I've been doing so far is this: Get
a mob that doesn't run, beat the crap out of it within an inch of it's life,
FD, pop up, re-aggro with disarm (so no damage), and let it beat on my back
while the cleric nukes it (so no ripost).

Here's the problem I see myself running into: Any mob that her nuke will
stick on is going to be green to me. If the mob runs like greens normally
do, it will not see my FD, my cleric will not get XP, and she will have a
half to three quarter life red conning mob beating her down.

Are there any places with an abundance of level 15 to 20 skellies? What are
the other mobs that don't run? Any information or helpful hints would be
appreciated.
