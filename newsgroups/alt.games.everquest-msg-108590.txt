	Same damage table, but Rangers have an innate ATK bonus which gives them a
small advantage until level 60 (when Warrior's triple attack gives them the
same statistical bonus).  Rangers also have a variety of proc and ATK buffs,
including one on the easier of the two epic blades, which also gives better
haste than the average Warrior has.  We used to have better weapons than the
other fighters, but that got eroded in Velious and completely tossed out in
Luclin.  (I want to find the guy who thinks Rangers need or want weapons that
proc Snare.)

	A Ranger who isn't tanking will be behind the mob, and thus avoid the 20%
loss in output due to mob parry/dodge/riposte.  Finally, on raids we deal more
damage than Warriors because we tend to live longer....
