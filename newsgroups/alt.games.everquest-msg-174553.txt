: While ZAP is a pain after a patch, it does
: not seem to lag me.

Here is the fix for ZAP and Patches causing problems.  Open ZAP go to
"program Control", then click the 'Program' tab
right click on Everquest.exe and click on  Changes Frequently.  Do the same
for eqgame.exe.

Now you will never have top Ctrl+alt+del to bring the premision box up to
say yes its ok I cnow what has changed and do it or I'll but you in the
trash can.

  Hope that helped the 3 or 4 people that didn't know about that little
trick.

Omiin
