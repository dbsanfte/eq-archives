Keep doing what you're doing.  There's all kind of anecdotal and subjective
talk about things "seeming" to go up faster by attempting higher-skill
combines, but I don't put any stock in them.

The very best thing you could do is to get your INT as high as possible,
preferably 255.

The second best thing you could do is to pick up a tinkered Geerlok Gem
Setter from a friendly gnome, to reduce your failures while skilling up.
