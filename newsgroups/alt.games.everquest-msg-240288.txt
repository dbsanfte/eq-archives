Amen to that! I just want them to tell me up front and stick to it - is 
this going to be an immersive fantasy adventure MMORPG or is going to be 
some sort of dressed up social circle? The stupid names have long been a 
sore spot for me. Hell, I deleted my main some time back (Rumbledor) not 
too long after I realized that his name sounded way too much like a 
certain wizard character from the Harry Potter books my wife and kids 
were reading. 

I've also since read all those books and really like them, btw. :)
