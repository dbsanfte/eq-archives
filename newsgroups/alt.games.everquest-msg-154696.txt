No, at least not any kind of way a person can reasonably expect to
ever do. They are venril sathir faction. You'd have to be in a guild
of career kunark dragon killers, 24/7, to even start to make a dent.

Just forget it, for all practical purpsoses its a closed door.

Sort of straight out along the path towards the zone to FM, but then
they scatter around after the odd NPC mob or a player they see.



>Three, are there ANY merchants an iksar can trade with outside of Cabilis?

Yes. Most druid rings have a beta neutral merchant. Innitially safe
ones are Butcherblock, lavastorm, toxula and steamfont. North ro has
quite a few druids on jagged pine residents faction, as does east k,
while the two druid/ranger types in West Commons behind the vendor are
on kithikor residents faction. You can actually raise these by killing
orcs in high hold pass. People often get confused by these druid type
factions because they all lower each other for the most part, like
you'll lose jaggedpine tree folk by killing the kithikor resident
faction ones (as well as kith residents)

The east freeport sewers has a group of npc vendors and such which are
on dismal rage and easy to raise via a bone chip quest to Xelha. You
should be dubious to them to start. I believe opal darkbriar and the
priestess of neriak will still be kos to you, the priestess you won't
be able to ever raise. Opal is raised by the bone chip quest or
killing Rephas in Qey hills (nice thing to do when bored and camping
hadden ;)  ) My wood elf druid discovered it could do the bone chip
quest in wolf form, while threaten in wood elf. I was max allied
FOREVER in wood elf form before I finally got opal darkbriar to
dubious. The priestess from neriak is scowl, but since she is still a
light blue con I kill her for fun when ever I'm down there. She is XP
and some VERY good factions while only lowering priests of innoruuk
(or neriak or something) The dismal rage people don't assist her on
me.

Murrissa sandwicher in nro just in from east freep and another lady in
EC as you leave west freep, are both on dervish faction I think. You
should only be apprehensive so can buy and sell there. Due to that,
killing dervishes is not a good idea for you. As you leave west
freeport the vendor is in the hut on your RIGHT in EC, in the hut on
your LEFT is a priestess of rodcet nife from qeynos. She will visit
the beat down upon you ; )

In the overthere zone, off to the right as you face the city and
somewhere near the zone to warsilks woods, is a beta neutral or
otherwise friendly faction Iksar vendror.

Oh and the whole of Shar Vahl is friendly to you, indiff in fact so
its your home away from home.
What I'd do as a 22 beastlord is go to kitty land. Do some adventuring
there and group in paludral. You can first get bound in shadowhaven by
the soulbinder, then later in shar vahl. 

Since you have luclin I'd sure not be hanging around in old eq areas
trying to raise vendor factions all day long. Around 30 or 35 you can
start to explore velious if you want, never had a beastlord there but
should do okay on the cougars and things. As with everyone else the
coldain dwarves will be apprehensive so you can use that city.

So the whole of Thurg and Shar Vahl are open to you, as far as
merchants. Shar Vahl even has a trainer. Many vendors in shadowhaven
and such will also be okay. Me, I'd go nuts in kittyland over in
Luclin with a beastlord.
