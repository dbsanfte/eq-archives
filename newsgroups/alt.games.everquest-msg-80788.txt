I'm not aware of any NPCs that will protect you from Gix.  The best solution is
run to zone while warning others of your Gix train.

Just a word of warning if you haven't already met him - Gix has a buddy named
Dragoon Zytl that roams a fair portion of the zone (around the lake and the
south and central area of the zone as far east as Befallen).  He's much higher
level and has a pet skeleton in tow.  He looks like a dark elf in shiny silver
plate.  Usually by the time you see him, he has seen you and it's too late.  He
likes to fear kite you to death so if you see him be prepared to hit /loc so you
can find your body.

Hate them DEs )  I still kill Zytl when I see him on track.  I've yet to pay him
back for all the deaths he has brought on my characters.
