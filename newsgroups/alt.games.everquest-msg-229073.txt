I was goofing around with my 27 necromancer last night and had the WEIRDEST
problem - I think it may be a new bug.

I'm leveling my necro fearkiting splitpaw gnolls.  Snare, Fear, Flutter,
Heat Blood, sit, fear wears off, stand, re-fear, re-snare, reapply dots,
repeat.  No problem, been doing it since 25.

But last night was different.  I pulled a wandering gnoll with the usual
combination, gnoll ran away slowly dying, fear wore off, I stood up, he came
in, I cast Fear - and he vanished.  I was still targeted on him, the DoTs
were still running, he was nowhere to be found.  Assuming he had warped to
his bind point,  I quickly sat and camped to clear aggro, then came back in.

Logged back in, went right to the spawn point, pulled another gnoll. Same
problem - the second time Fear hit, the mob vanished.  I ran back to the
spawn point, he wasn't there.  Again I camped.

Came back in, I was getting low-ish on health (since I'd been burning health
for mana).  Saw a nice green elephant, snared it, lifetapped, ran a bit,
didn't feel like fighting with it so I hit it with fear, it ran for a ways,
fear wore off, it came back, I stood and feared it again - poof.  I /bugged
it while camping.

Seems like the second time I hit anything with a Fear last night, it
vanished - not to spawn point, nowhere in the area, just gone.  Anyone else
see anything of the sort?
