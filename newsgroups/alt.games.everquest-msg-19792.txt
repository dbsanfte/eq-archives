The TBB is probably one of the most overpriced and overhyped items in
the game. Simple fact is, you will NEVER, and I mean NEVER come close
to the damage output that the FBSS's haste gives over the 15 str on
the TBB.  In all honestly, the only thing that TBB is ever going to do
for you is increase your carrying weight.

And while the effects of haste are subjective and vary from subject to
subject, the effects of haste are most definatly not.  Take a look at
log parsers comparing your FBSS damage compared to non-fbss damage..
there won't be any comparison.

If your'e honestly that worried over the AC in your belt slot, save
yourself several thousand plat and pick up a Straw Spun Belt instead.
