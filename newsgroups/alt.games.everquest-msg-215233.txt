I've done 2 LDON groups, really like it.  Could they put a single vendor at the
dungeon entrance?  That way once you've completed your task you can sell loot
and those who want to continue playing in the dungeon can, those who need to go
can.
My first group one guy got lost trying to get back to camp, and, of course, he
was the master looter.  We had to log off before he ever got there - no loot
for us.  The second group it was really HELL keeping up with the master looter,
(a bard), and there wasn't a *chance* I was going to let him get away from
us....
