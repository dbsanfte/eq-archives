I'm not a lady but I can speak in falsetto if you want. :)

The movie was boring in parts...but then again, so was the book.  I enjoyed
Bilbo's birthday party as much in the movie as I did the book...that is, not
at all. BORING.  But most of the rest of the trilogy was great.

What I really liked about the movie was that they did a pretty damned fine
job of recreating my imagination.  A lot of stuff looked exactly like I
thought it did.

A local place was playing LotR in their IMAX theater...I wish I was able to
go at the time. :)
