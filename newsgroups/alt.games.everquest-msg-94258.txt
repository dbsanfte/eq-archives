I can't answer for how others go through the newsgroup, personally, I read
the new messages as I encounter them, and respond to them as I read them.  I
don't read all the new posts, then go back and post replies.  It is very
likely you will be getting crap from people about old posts for many days to
come, if not weeks in some cases, that's just the things happen.
Eventually, it will settle down.  The one trend I am seeing lately in your
posts is a complete failure to keep any of the post you are replying to in
your response.  This has probably been pointed out by others, and probably
will still be pointed out for a while.  If you do not keep any of the
message you are replying to, many people will have no idea at all what you
are responding to.  The way usenet works, it is quite possible for responses
to arrive before the post they are responses to, it is possible for posts to
never arrive.  Do not assume that just because it looks easy to follow in
your newsreader that it will be for everyone else.  You should always leave
in as much of the post you are replying to as is necessary to show what it
is your are responding to.  You should not always just blindly leave the
entire post, unless it is necessary for your response to make sense.  You
should always leave in any attributions that show who you are responding to.
