I see what you're saying.  the /shout channel is a zone-wide channel, and in
roleplaying it makes no sense that someone on one side of Stonebrunt to hear
a shout on the other side.  For that matter, many zones are "too big" to
expect that.  But that's a problem with the shout channel itself.  Gameplay
puts certain constraints on roleplay.  It's hard to roleplay your
peace-loving dungeon crawler, I'm sure.  :-)

If a character is running for his life with several monsters on his tail, it
makes sense from a roleplaying perspective to shout out to warn the people
you know you're leading the monsters to in your escape.  I suspect I'd be
screaming bloody murder if something similar happened to me in life.
Thankfully, that's never happened to me outside of Norrath.   :-)

P.S.  I like the quote after your usual signature!
