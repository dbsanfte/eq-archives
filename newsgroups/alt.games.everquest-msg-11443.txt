The Antonican Times in Qeynos mentioned that some merchants were asking
for assistance in providing food during this time of famine. Being in
Qeynos, I immediately hied myself over to Voleen's and spoke with Karn
Tassen.

You say, 'Hail Karn Tassen'

Karn Tassen says 'Bah, I told Voleen it would happen and it finally did!
Food is becoming so scarce that I'm starting to run out of stock. You
wouldn't happen to [be a baker] yourself or maybe you [know] someone who
bakes?

You say, 'I am a baker'

(Note: 'I know a baker' and variations provoked no response.)

Karn Tassen says 'Well good! Maybe you can help me restock. If you are a
baker you could help me out by restocking my [muffin supply]. Or if you
don't mind a little travel, you can pick up a [shipment of bread] for
me.

'What muffin supply?'

'Thanks, you're a pal. Take this crate and fill it with muffins, then
seal it up and bring the Full Muffin Crate back to me. Don't go trying
to pass off that store bought stuff on me either, I need fresh baked
muffins. The ones in the stores are already too old and will get moldy
too fast, so I don't want those.

(Note: There IS apparently a difference between player made and store
bought.)

Take the Muffin Crate (it is Lore, No Drop, weighs 2.0, 10 slots and
holds small for those newbies looking for a free box) and fill it with
10 UNSTACKED baked muffins and combine. 10 muffins with some stacked
will not combine; 12 muffins with some stacked will combine if all 10
slots are filled. Careful or you might loose muffins you'd want to keep.

Give the combined box back to Karn for some gold (I got 2gp, 3gp and 4gp
the three times I did this) and the following faction adjustments:

Your faction standing with MerchantsofQeynos got better.
Your faction standing with CircleOfUnseenHands got worse.
Your faction standing with AntoniusBayle got better.
Your faction standing with CoalitionofTradefolk got better.
Your faction standing with GuardsofQeynos got better.

The conversation with Voleen is similar and results in the identical
quest.

The quest about the shipment of bread sends you to the Centaur camp in
South Karana to pick up a Bag of Bread Loaves (Lore, No Drop, not a
container and non-edible) from Jarlen Meadowgreen, brother of the
crafted armor quest NPCs who has just moved here because of the great
baking opportunities :-) Wait around a bit and watch him fuss over his
loaves rising next to the fire pit, its a hoot. Say to him 'I am here to
pick up some bread loaves' and pay him 2 gp to get them. Return them to
Karn or Voleen for the same faction adjustments and some cash... the one
time I did this, I got 1pp 3gp.
