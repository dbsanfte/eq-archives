And given there are only 4 class types, you can have all of them in 
every group.

In general yes, in particular encounters: No. 

ie There should be encounters that do favour a particular class over all 
others. And such encounters should exist and be relevant for each class.

Not much to make druids feel special in that model.

I agree that EQ got it wrong with its ridiculous weighting on clerics.
(although THAT is primarily exacerbated by denying the alternative 
healers rezzes...a druid can just say 'sorry you all lost the evenings 
xp gain guys' and that is stupid, particularly as the cleric, being the 
best healer in the game is the least likely to run dry in a fight in the 
first place and is thus least likely to actually need the rez.) 

So druids/shamen are double curse... they aren't the best healers in the 
game, and if that shortcoming is made manifest they can't even repair 
the damage after the fact. That's just bad design.

To top off the insult there are no zones/encounters where druids or 
shamen are the favoured healers. So yeah, EQ is totally out of balance 
there.

But EQ2s genericness was the wrong way to fix the problem. Giving the 
alt healers rez was a good move, but then they failed to preserve their 
uniqueness -- the differences are just tactical flavour -- you never 
really need a druid, or even prefer one, any healer-class will fill the 
healer-slot in any/every situation.

That is disappointing.

No, actually its not different at all.

But if you can still take the mobs equally effectively with any 
reasonable group composition these 'tactical differences' are largely 
irrelevant.
