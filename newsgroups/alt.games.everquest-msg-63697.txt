Monks hardly got screwed with their epic. Its by FAR one of the easiest to
complete, and the item is extremely useful!

Necro epic is crap. Why bother!

Chanter epic not useful??? What are you guys....level 20?? Shissar speed is
awesome, and manaless short cast time haste as a click effect? Have you guys
EVER raided?? VoG may be faster, but not by very much! And I get no AC buff with
VoG! Gimme snake luvvin!!

Warrior gets my vote for the most worthless epic!! I can spend WAY under 100K
and get weapons that blow the warrior epic out of the water for damage and
taunt. The reward you get for the difficulty of the quest is a slap to the face
for warriors, IMO.
