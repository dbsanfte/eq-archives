Trooper Vaurk is the guy who accepts the explorer knives. FWIW, turning in
4 explorer knives gets you 100 points of faction with Legion of Cabilis and
25 points with Greenmist, Cabilis Residents, and Swifttails. You'll also
get Pirates of Gunthak faction for killing explorers, if it's worth anything
to you...
