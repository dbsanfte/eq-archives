Yeah, and it was incredibly effective -- a 200K download and you're
back in business.  I hope that Verant is not so retarded as to think
that this crap is going to stop anyone even minorly serious about
hacking the game...  IMO, it's just pure lame-ass for them to monopolize
my machine with a game that they have designed to have incredibly long
camps, horribly long levels, etc. and expect me not to keep myself
entertained by surfing the web, reading e-mail, etc.
