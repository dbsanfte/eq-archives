I am NOWHERE near getting AA abilities, but this regeneration nerfing in the
patch certainly is WRONG IMNSHO.
We Iksar and the Trolls get some bse-level regen, to offset the HUGE
experience penalty, (or vice versa...;-))
To get an AA ability will cost us 20% more exp, (1 AA pt is based on
levelling 50-51, or 51-52 IIRC)
We need to buy the first point to get our standard rate of regen. i.e. we
get to spend 120% of the exp for an AA point for NOTHING.
Then to improve on this, we do the same as anyione else, but STILL with the
exp penalty.
So, For a human and an iksar warrior with 1 AApt, both would have the sasme
level of regen. BUT the cost to the Iksar would be an extra level worth of
exp at the cost of levelling 51-52=20%, for something they ALREADY had!
Then we get to spend extra for the next level of AA regen, at the same 20%
penalty, without the advantage we had before to offset the penalty...

Or am I missing something obvious?
This is truly unfair- but then Regen isn't going to help much unless you are
soloing or without healer support.
Even then it only affects downtime, but this leads to further slowing of the
experience...
