Actually, it is... You are given *many* options to scale back the
graphics if your computer isn't up to it, or if you just can't afford
the upgrade at this time. Holding off on the new *models* (you still
will have access to all other graphics with ony 128MB) until you have
the hardware for it won't kill you (and in fact some people seem to
prefer it).

The original poster was arguing that the requirements were unjustified,
and I argued in return that they could very well be, depending on the
amount of custom models, including not only players, but all weapons and
armor.
