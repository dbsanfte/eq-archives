Big discussion getting underway in the Ultima Online group about an
announcement today that players will be able to buy, for 29.95, pre
skilled-up characters from one of several templates.

So what about EQ?  I mean unlike UO, EQ is still takes time and much monitor
watching to make it to the high levels.

Would you pay for that ready to roll, all spells(if applicable) scribed,
character/class you've always wanted to play?  From the company itself and
perhaps at a substantial savings over characters on say playerauc/ebay???
I'd imagine in a game like EQ they could, at extra charge, equip you with
any realm items of your choice...
