Real tag is fun. Playing tag over the internet isn't.

I've never been killstolen in EQ that I can ever recall. Nor have I ever
had someone train giants onto me (well, there was one time, but boy was he
surprised when I killed all 3) I HAVE been ambushed and killed in UO...a
lot. I've played on PK-oriented text-muds where when you got attacked you
ran or died, because you never won if someone else started it. Maybe I'm
just no good at it...*shrug* How is your opinion that PK is fun any more
valid than my opinion that it isn't?

Trust me, I don't.

And yet every EQ related webboard I've read has stated one thing quite
clearly: People who left EQ for DAoC are coming back in HUGE numbers. So
obviously a good time is not being had by all.
