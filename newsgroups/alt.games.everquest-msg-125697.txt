My experience has been identical to Dan's (including the several
bubble apparent mana drain for a low cost spell).  But, after reading
your post and Lance's, I'd venture to guess that perhaps Dan and I
never managed to synchronize with the server when we tried it.  Looks
like some experimentation is in order, gonna have to figure out how to
tell when the server is updating actual mana, as opposed to when the
client is updating "presumed" mana.  Actually, it's been so long since
I tried it that they may have fixed the manabar to not be able to be
so ridiculously wrong, that would make it a lot easier to get the
timing right I'm sure.
