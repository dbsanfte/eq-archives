I'm looking for an area that is open and relatively safe.  The best place
I've ever found was the Paw spires.  Lots of open area and could zone into
Paw if I got in trouble.  I was only able to kite in the wee hours of the
nite/morn when they weren't camped, but it was still very successful.
Anyone know of any places similar?  Thanks!

Rom
