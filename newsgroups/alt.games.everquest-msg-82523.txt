Mm...well, RZ is pretty much open PvP. There are times when it's
considered rude to PK someone, such as banking or when they have the
AFK or LD flag up, but there's no actual rules against it. Attacking
someone while they're engaged with a mob, especially with intent to
cause xp loss (Rooting the PC, dispelling debuffs/snares/etc on the
mob, so on), is against the rules, as is attacking someone while they
loot their corpse, or at their spawn point or zone line before they
have any obvious control over their character (While they're obviously
still loading).

However, all of these "greif" PvP tactics that are "illegal" are
difficult to prove. The GM has to catch the offending player in the
act to be able to do anything about it. Most of the greif players know
this, and will only do it once or twice and leave before a GM has time
to show up.

As for the "legal" PK tactics...well, if you don't want to be PKed,
you should play on a non-PvP server. Just because you feel PvP should
only be used to solve problems such as KSing and ninja looting doesn't
mean everyone else should or does.
