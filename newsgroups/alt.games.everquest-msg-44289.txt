Statement at the very web page you posted a link to:

W95/CIH viruses are able to split up the body of the virus code and place it
within unused parts of the infected file

Your statement:

 the file run32dll.exe isn't an actual system file, the virus as renamed your
actual run32.dll file
and replaced it with the exe

Hmm...not much in common.

If he had done what that page says in the first place, it is likely that his
system could be fixed without a reformat. Whether it can be now remains to be
seen.
