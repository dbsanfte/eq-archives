Plenty. It's called "sharing loot in a group"...

Incidently, I never paid for breeze being cast on me before and never
asked for it. The mana regen boost is too small to be worth paying
anything worth giving for it... If someone casts a drive by, great. If
they demand pay for the drive-by, I tell them where they can shove it.

Clarity/C2, on the other hand, I'll gladly pay for.
