What server?  If it's on the Raithe, I've got my Paladin sitting around in
Freeport who can walk around freely down there (in a few more levels,
Befallen will be safer for her than East and West Freeport).

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
