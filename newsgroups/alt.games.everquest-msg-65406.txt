Others have already corrected you on what "DDR" means, but I can help you
with the fans.

Go right now to <http://www.pcpowerandcooling.com>.  They sell ultra-quiet
power supplies and cooling fans.

I replaced 4 power supplies in our computer room, and the ambient noise
dropped considerably. The only noise left was coming from a single old-style
AT power supply (which is going away soon), and the cooling fan on my wife's
Athlon, which had an amazingly loud annoying buzz that had hitherto been
masked by the power supply.  I just replaced the Athlon fan, and now all you
can hear is that old system in the corner.

Highly recommended.
