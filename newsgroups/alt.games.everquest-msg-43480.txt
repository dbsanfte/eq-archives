I can't really get back into EQ due to downtime and long travel times.  I want
my whompa and medical supplies.

I logged on to hunt near the Sarnak Fort with a guildmate.  My character was in
Rivervale, however, and it took a little over 2 hours to get to LoIO (I
couldn't find a teleport that evening).  The next character I logged on was
wounded and out of mana and required a 20 minute wait before I could play.  For
these two reasons alone I will probably drop my EQ subscription later this
year.

Him.
