Totally and completely legitimate $$$$
Read this and you will make tons of money guaranteed!

NETWORK TOGETHER AND MAKE MONEY USING PAYPAL

Dear Friend,

These are not scams. And no one is forcing you to do it. It is providing a service to you if you wish to participate...adding you to a list.  Chill out people! Open your mind. Big companies scam us all the time (adding a $1 or $3 fee here or there), charging us 39.95 or more on useless work at home crap and we pay it mindlessly. Why not try to network together as regular people? Have you ever thought that rich people want us to think that these are scams and we can't make money like this so that we stay poor or middle class? Or that other companies or programs are jealous of this because everyone could possibly flock to this program, leaving their program a failure and the owners of them flat broke?

Read on if your interested, if not I'm sorry for wasting your time.


SUGGESTION:  Read this entire message carefully! (Print it out or download it.)


Follow the simple directions and watch the money come in! It�s that easy. It's legal. And, your investment is only $6.00.

IMPORTANT: This is not a rip-off; it is not indecent; it is not illegal; and it is virtually no risk-it really works! If all of the following instructions are adhered to, you will receive extraordinary dividends.

AGAIN, PLEASE NOTE: Follow these directions EXACTLY, and $20,000 or more can possibly be yours in 4 to 6 weeks. This program remains successful because of the honesty and integrity of the participants.
Please continue its success by carefully adhering to the instructions. 

In this business your product is not solid and tangible, it's a service. You are in the business of developing Mailing Lists.  Many large corporations are happy to pay big bucks for quality lists. However, the money made from the mailing lists is secondary to the income which is made from people like you and me asking to be included in that list. Here are the 4 easy steps to success:

STEP 1:
Take a few minutes to join Paypal:
https://www.paypal.com
The Internet's most trusted Internet banking system for your future income. When creating your Paypal account make sure you use the same Email address as your user name in the list below so people can send money to your account.


STEP 2
Once you have a Paypal account running, use Paypal to post $1.00 to each person on the list, with a message that says "ADD ME TO YOUR MAILING LIST". To do this you may need to use a credit card, which is very easy, and secure so nobody but Paypal may see it. If you don't have a credit card show this great lucrative offer to someone that has one and get them to help you pay the $6.

What you are doing is creating a service. This is absolutely legal! You are requesting a legitimate service and you are paying for it! Like most of us I was a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all. But I looked around and did some homework and found it was perfectly legal.

#3) ryukentank@yahoo.com
#4) erwinwolffnl@hotmail.com
#5) kurtengel05@yahoo.com.au
#6) ceg4018@yahoo.com 

STEP 3
After sending the money to the first 6 people on the list, you can remove the name next to the #1 on the list and move the rest of the names up one position (#2 becomes #1, #3 becomes #2, etc?) Then place your name in the #6 position.


STEP 4 
Change anything you need to,but try to keep this article as close to the original as possible. Now, post your amended article to at least 200 newsgroups (there are thousands of groups). And email your message to as many people you can. But remember, the more you post and email the more money you make! This is perfectly legal!
If you have any doubts, refer to Title 18 Sec. 1302 & 1241 of the Postal Lottery laws. Keep a copy of these steps for yourself and, whenever you need money, you can use it again and again. 

PLEASE REMEMBER that this program remains successful because of the honesty and integrity of the participants and by their carefully adhering to the directions. You are simply paying into a money making chain of participants and if the chain is broken you are screwing someone else out of their fair share. What an opportunity for only a total of $6.00 !! What have you got to lose! To begin with, please send your joining fee now and then add your own Email Address to the list and you�re in business!


HOW TO POST TO NEWS GROUPS?
Use Netscape or Internet Explorer and try searching for various newsgroups(on-line forums, message boards, chat sites, discussions.) Log on any search engine like yahoo.com,google.com,altavista.com, excite.com, etc., then search with the subject ''millionaire message board'' or ''money making message board'' or ''employment message board'' or ''money making discussions'' or ''money making forum'' or ''business message board'' etc. You will find thousands & thousands of message boards. Click on them one by one and you will find the option 'post a new message'. Then Post this article as a 'new message' by highlighting the text of this letter and selecting copy then paste from the edit menu. Fill in the Subject, this will be the header that everyone sees as they scroll through the list of postings in a particular group, click the post message button.
You're done with your first one! It only takes about 60 seconds to complete postings on message boards after you catch on. 
REMEMBER, THE MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU POST IN, THE MORE MONEY YOU WILL MAKE!! BUT YOU HAVE TO POST A MINIMUM OF 200! That is it You will begin receiving money in your account from around the world within days! When your name is no longer on the list, you just take the latest posting in the newsgroups, and send out another $6.00 to Email Addresses using Paypal on the list, putting your name at number 6 again. And start posting again. The thing to remember is that thousands of people all over the world are joining the Internet and reading these articles everyday. JUST LIKE YOU ARE NOW!! So, can you afford $6.00 to see if it really works?? I think so! 

People have said, "what if the plan is played out and no one sends you the money? So what! What are the chances of that happening when there are tons of new honest users and new honest people who are joining the
internet & newsgroups everyday and are willing to give it a try ?? And besides, you are only spending 6 dollars one time. The only thing you have to do afterwards is to send it to as many places as possible. Good Luck !!
