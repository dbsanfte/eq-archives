Kind of amusing, eh?  We have this exchange here and the next day
we're sharing the OC/IC mobs.  :-)

BTW - EQW is working well for me, does all that I'd ask.  Even got a
3box session (all 3 running on one machine) the other day.  I didn't
think I'd need it with EQ's built in windowing support, but the gamma
piece was the clincher.

If there's anything I see as a potential downside, it is the lack of
being able to toggle full screen when using EQW.  Sometimes, it is
nice just to get a bigger picture.  But it ain't the end of the world.
