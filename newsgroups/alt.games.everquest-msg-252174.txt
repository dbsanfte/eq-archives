Ugh.  :(  I hadn't even considered this as a potential issue until your post
(never played an Eye of Zomm capable toon hehe)  

Sorry to hear about finding out the hard way.  If you do find a counter
measure, please let us know...  

The only option I see is to always make sure you are seated, facing/abutting a
wall when you cast the Eye.  However, with the falling through the Geometry,
getting stuck, Aggro through walls, and everything else that can go wrong I
don't know how reasonable a solution that would be.

I almost bought another 3 month card yesterday because I'm starting to miss the
game a bit now that I'm about 2 months out from the game but for whatever
reason, I forgot to pick one up while at Wal Mart.  I wonder if that was
Freudian or just old age. =P
