No, I never said that I wanted it on.  I dont read the group, so what
happens to it doesnt bother me.
However, you actually wanting it taken down IS selfish, because others want
it on.  If you dont like what is going on in that group, then dont read it.
It is the same as the person who rallies for a violent programme on TV to be
banned, because THEY dont like it.

Sorry, but someone being a racist in their own 'group' does no harm.  You
have no right telling people what they can and cant say in their own group,
and wether that group is allowed to exist.
In that respect yes, you are 'just as bad'.

That makes no sense.
People dont think 'Ok I am a clueless idiot, and AOL is considered to be the
worst ISP available - therefore, I will sign up for it.'.
Someone will join AOL because they know no better, they see the adverts on
TV and decide to use one of those nice 'AOL Platinum' CD's that come in
their Sunday papers.
