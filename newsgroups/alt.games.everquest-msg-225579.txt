Mostly you have to kill the boss of one plane or finish some quest to gain
access to the next plane. The "flag" isnt a item you carry in inventory. It
is character information which you can check out at the seer in POK by
saying "guided meditation"

You dont need flags for justice, innovation, disease or nightmare. (or
knowledge or tranquility)
Valor and storms require flags, unless your over lvl 55. You get flagged for
this by doing the mavuin quest in justice, and this involves finishing one
of the trials (usually execution, tho torture was pretty easy).
Decay requires a flag, or a level limit. You get the flag by defeating
Grummus in decay and hailing the projection that spawns on his death.
Thunder is level 62 or 63 (cant remember) or flag, and you get the flag by
doing a quest in storms which involves collecting pieces that the various
giants drop there. You really need a raid for some parts of it (or a VERY
uber group)
Torment is level or flag, I think its killing terris thule in nightmare
B.... and to get to nightmare B you need to finish the hedge maze in
nightmare.
...
and so on it goes
Check up "planar progression" quest on allakhazam if you want more info.

Also most of the planes can be entered without flag if you have enough (35?)
flagged people in raid already. This was a recent change by sony, presumably
to keep guilds together. Sucks not being able to raid because your not
flagged.
