They suck ass for the effort involved. The ones that don't suck ass
just suck very much. Really even on a new server at the appropriate
levels they suck since it would be pretty impossible to kill some of
the stuff in the area it is in unless you had a couple 35th level or
so groups and it would take forever to do the mobs everyone had to do 
for the rare spawns that dropped this stuff. 

I thought the cleric legs were okay and had all but one piece. The one
piece came off some rare thought horror thing in mons letalis but I
never got the dumb thing to spawn. She bought seb scale legs which
were as good or better for like 1500 plat a bargain compared to those
horrible quests.

I think the weapons especially suck.

Just crap design, basically. You'll need to be high enough level to do
most of it that your time would be better spent getting the drops you
could all get instead and later hitting the planes or something.
