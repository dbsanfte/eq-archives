And to the suprise of the crowd, Bizbee immediately gets the "Get's the
Picture" Oscar award in only one post. They took it upon themselves and
were not directed by any GM to "enforce the rules" when any Senior Guide
or GM could have done it in about three seconds.

For the record, and in shocking agreement to James' followup post, I
know of no member of that guild that actually working on the baking
tradeskill for that vendor's exchange rate. Then again, they don't need
to in most cases.
