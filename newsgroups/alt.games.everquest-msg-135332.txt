Wow! Thanks for all the replies. What a range! Anything from 5K to 40K
depending on the server. Sadly, on ours, it's towards the lower end. I
already saw one in the bazaar last night on Xev for 10K. I'm not
undercutting that. Cash is always nice, but it's not worth it to dump
part of the warrior epic for 8K or so.
