Snip, yeah etc etc.

I wished back in the day when I was doing really stupid things
on Usenet that I'd thought up a fictional 13 year old daughter to 
blame it on. 

"Why no, my 13 year old daughter was posting to 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.rpg with the huge ass ren and stimpy asci sig,

That would have worked out nicely. Instead I just had to admit I was
ignorant.
