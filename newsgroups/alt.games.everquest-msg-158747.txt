Rats, Tsetsian flys (not sure about other flys) and the multitudinous goo
types are all fairly normal, though they do hit in the 250+ range, so don't
get hit, and everything has a LOT of hp, somewhere in the 15-20k hp range.
FWIW, only the Pestilence rat types were ever giving me a "too high level to
charm" (making them over 53.)

Spiders are all casters, and NASTY, the little ones (arachnidae crawlers)
are necros, the big ones (arachnae terranis) are clerics.

The larvae things have even more HP than rats/goos/flys, straight melee and
don't summon though.

From what I hear the Diseased Malarians are also nasty (summon, cast
spells), and most other malarian types cast also, however malarian pests are
straight melee, not sure if they summon.

From what I've heard the puslings cast, no idea on hp or summoning.

Haven't found anything in PoD immune to snare yet, I'd expect the higher
level stuff around and past the fat bastard to be immune though, but then
you won't be exping off those guys.

Mr. Snookums (my charmed rat in PoD) and me went from 65% into 57 to 60%
into 58 over the weekend, with brief excursions to do some kobold
slaughtering in Velks (won CC arms that I'm wearing, yay), and a stint at
soloing in the Deep (fun!) and some duoing in Kael (/hug Tunare's Renewal).
Rats that hit for 288 double, and with my 70% pet haste on them are the own
in PoD, I could've killed a lightcrawler, but the pathing in that area blows
asschunks and I trained myself.

I was getting slightly higher than average resists on root, but that doesn't
really surprise me anymore, snare resisted maybe 1/10 the time (unless you
need it to snare first time, in which case it will resist 4).  No idea on
nuke resists, I never bothered since it was a waste of mana compared to
either charming and hasting a rat, or healing my current rat (once again,
/hug Tunare's Renewal, even if it does only heal 23% of Mr. Snookums)
