Not too difficult with the old UI.

I dread rearranging my entire spell book now.  I finally got it organized.
I like having the 8 spells per page, but wish they would have spread the
spells out and kept them on the same page they used to be on.

Sounds awesome, haven't gotten around to it yet though.

Nice.

Agreed, it's a pain in the butt right now, but I'm sure I'll aclimate.

I always used the full screen one in the old UI.  I loved it, now I have to
start all over with customizing.

Been there for as long as I've been playing.  You could even use them in the
skanky old windowed view, just had to set them up in the full screen mode.

I'm looking forward to that too.

Bags have been movable for a long time now.  Agreed that being able to open
more than two containers is nice.

I really need to switch over to the new UI, just been hesitant until the the
/who bug is fixed.  Looking forward to it overall, but not the work involved
in getting everything setup the way I want it.
