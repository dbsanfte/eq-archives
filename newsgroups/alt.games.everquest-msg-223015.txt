    My memory was "they scored lowest possible in that aspect". My mistake
was writing down that this was zero, and not 5% (which is the minimum
possible on this test).

    Sounds like someone that has no clue what his scores actually mean, even
though the person making the test posted what it meant, is getting crabby
that the test didn't say what he wanted it to say.

    Seeing as I'm not them, I can't answer that. I also can't imagine what
the motivation would be for someone to re-do a test until they got an answer
they thought was good, then to post that answer on a private message board
when they could just as easily NOT do the test or NOT post the results. I'm
sure you have a good conspiracy theory for it, though. As for absolutes,
have you ever had to scrutinize "sliding scale" scores before?

    Chrysler sends out satisfaction surveys to people who have just bought a
new car or had a car serviced for a warranty issue. They then derive scores
from the surveys, and dealerships are required to maintain a certain score
to stay "Five Star Certified". Important point: Chrysler uses "top box"
scoring, where even though each question is on a 5 point sliding scale, a
dealership only gets credit for a response if the response was best
possible. I get to see the surveys when they come back in (dealerships get a
photocopy), including the "comments" section. Some people that, from their
comments, only sounded mildly pleased with their experiences tick off all
top-box scores. Others, who sound much more pleased by their buying
experiences from their comments, must spend an hour on their survey,
carefully deciding if the cleanliness of the waiting area really was a "5"
or a "4". Still others refuse to give any top scores no matter how pleased
they are, since they believe top scores are only for people that go well
beyond the norm (I bet you had a humanities teacher in high school that
thought the same silly way). Different people look at sliding scales and see
different things.

    Funny related story: a friend of a friend was recently applying for a
job that would have given him a significant raise over what he was earning
elsewhere, and had to fill out a sliding scale test as part of the
application process. Sadly for him, he didn't believe in absolutes and
overthought his responses. Example: on the question, "There are good reasons
for being late to work," he put "slightly agree". As he said afterwards,
"Well, what if you had car troubles? Or came down with a serious illness?
Those would be good reasons!" He didn't get called back for a second
interview.
