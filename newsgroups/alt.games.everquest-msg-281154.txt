DoD is no problem here... but I'm trying to pick up a copy of Dragons of 
Norrath. I've pretty much exhausted the local retailers. Anyone know 
where I can order it Online ideally in Canda? But even somehwere in the 
states that will ship it to Canada would be alright.

Its not for me so I don't really want to go with digital DL. (And I'm 
not exactly impressed that the digital version costs as much or more 
than the boxed version when you get absolutely nothing physical... but 
that's a separate issue.)

Tia for any links/suggestions.
-regards,
