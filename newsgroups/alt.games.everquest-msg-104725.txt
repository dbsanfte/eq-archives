Right and no changes are being or have even been done
to the game. Its been static the whole time.

Ah there it is! The war cry of the defeated.
Play another class! Quit the game if you hate it so much!
I can counter with: If you think the druid class is so powerful why
don't you play one? Why doesn't everyone?

BTW I do play other classes, several in fact. Doesn't mean I
would not like my druid to be viable as well.

You'd think the druids are asking for death touch and plate armor.
Sheesh.

What is wrong with discussing issues with the classes
and suggesting some changes to Verant? They ARE doing caster
balancing now, they know there is a problem. Just like they did
Melee re-balancing months ago before Luclin came out.
