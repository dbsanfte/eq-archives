Take a run to Stonebrunt through the warrens.  On the coast is a ship
with a pair of doors facing the dock - click the doors.  You're in the
Gulf of Gunthak.  At the lighthouse is a soulbinder and a bank.

Dulak always seems to have people in that range in it - still a lot of
DB mobs to low 50's and decent cash drops.

4 kinds - Assassinate the boss, Rescue the hostage, collect X number of
something, Kill Y number of mobs.

Of them all, Kill Y number is the easiest, as you don't have to worry about
taking a wrong turn or the RNG making it hard to get your drops.

Lots of other info on LDoN in the newsgroup - I'd do a google search

Welcome back, and have fun.
