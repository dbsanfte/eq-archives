Compare SCM level 1 versus SCM level 3.
Compare healing gift 1 to HG3/Advanced gift3

He could of maxed really usful skills instead of putting a point everywhere,
cuz IMO the difference between level 1 and 3 is huge.

CS3/LR 5 versus every arch ability at level 1, hmm?
Same for adept/gift/scm and reinforcement.
