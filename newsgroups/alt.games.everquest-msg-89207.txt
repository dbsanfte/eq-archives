Personally, I'd say that Rogues are more like ninjas than
Monks are.

Ninjas are stealthy, sneaky, and masters of the short,
devastating attack, rather than being able to sustain
a toe-to-toe fight.  Rogues all the way.

Samurai, on the other hand, are more "monk-ish", in that
they have mastered many kinds of attack, and can fight
well and long, and take a pretty good beating too.
