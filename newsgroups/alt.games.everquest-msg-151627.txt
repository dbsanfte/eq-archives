Where exactly are you exp hunting that you need /discipline Defensive to
stay alive?

I use it maybe once a night, at most... and generally wish that I hadn't, as
I would have survived anyways, and the 3 minutes of damage output reduction
was for nothing.  (or I died despite using it, so it didn't matter.)

And as far as a "The shit is hitting the fan so hard that the tank isn't
being healed." thing....  Lay Hands will beat defensive any day of the week.
Defensive will extend my life for 30% longer.  (unless casters are nuking
me, in which case it does nothing.)  Lay hands gives you back what...  70?
80 percent of your life, every time.  Also, Lay Hands can be used in a far
greater variety of situations, since it can save other people.   Using
Defensive, I can only protect myself.

A_paladin_01's holy blade clenses his target! (3564)
An elementalbone skeleton is hit for 3564 points of damage!

*shrug*

I prefer some pretty decent  healing ability and haste to feign death and
invisibility.  (as I said, this was my opinion.)
