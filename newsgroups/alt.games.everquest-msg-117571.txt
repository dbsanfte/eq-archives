Druid's lightest root does 10 damage.  As long as the alt does 11 then
you're gtg.

Druids have that argument covered, sorry. :)

Level 1-3, very weak DS
Level 4-40, strong DS.  If a critter is running (snared) and your PLee can't
even do 11pts damage, then they NEED to just stand there and beat on the
critter for "5 minutes."  Once 11 points is done, cast Grasping Roots and
let the DS finish the critter off.

My druid has snare, Grasping Roots and Drones of Doom (34 dot, whatever the
name is) clothing items, so he doesn't have to do a whole lot involving
mana. :)
