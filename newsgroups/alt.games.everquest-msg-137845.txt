No, indeed. Clients are more interested in if the end product works
well, not if you did something brilliant along the way. Having spent
nine years doing customer support for software, I have a strong
interest in ensuring that what I write needs minimal or no support.
This is good for me, and it keeps my customer happy as well.

Next time I pick up a new client I'll probably be raising my rates to
the $75 range, but my primary client right now has tossed enough work
my way (and they pay on time, too!) that I'm happy to keep them at my
current rate.

Yep. You may not get rich, but it pays the bills.

I'm working on a commercial package now (just started preliminary work
this past week) that I hope will make me rich :)
