It will work, eventually, it just takes a loong time... And that may not 
fix *all* of the relevant factions. Just bear very much in mind that you 
are doing it for roleplaying or simply "fun" reasons... The Luclin and 
PoP expansions have rendered old-world factions pretty much meaningless. 
For purely practical reasons, you may be better off with a deity.
