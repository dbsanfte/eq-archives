Im just as happy to hear jaZZ do a %t at 30% on a first brood, as I am to
hear Cel do it on aary, to Davian on AoW, to Monual on Agnarr, to Sui on
Diabo xxxixixixi sisisisisxj xixixixixix.

I like hearing of my friends and associates accomplishments, WHATEVER level
of the game they are at.

I remember when I finished my epic, I remember the first time I killed aary,
first time I killed AoW, Zland, Emp etc, and I like sharing with others
excitement when they too repeat feats.

And as for the "dick waving" with loot...  I've gotten 2 items between
december 10th and now,  so 1% of my links even relate to me...   fuck me,
I've linked my rogues 2 illusion masks after he got them, so happy was I
they finally dropped.  Thats as many non-uber items as "uber" personal items
linked..

I have a r/l + great online friends channel, it has people in different
guilds, when they get something cool drop they will link it to me, when my
guild gets something cool I link it for them, not to dick wave, but because
were curious and take an interest in mobs/loot

Sometimes its "OMFG look at this!!!"  (/drool..) sometimes its "omg.. can
you believe ubermob_01 dropped this" (crap).. either way, mobs, loot and
peoples advancement interests me.
