To the best of my knowledge, when two identical (i.e. same name) spells are
cast on one target, only the stronger one has any effect.  This is why you
can't SoW yourself, then SoW yourself again, and so on, until you break the
sound barrier.  However, if you have two <i> different </i> spells that both
produce a slowing effect, you should be able to combine their effects.
