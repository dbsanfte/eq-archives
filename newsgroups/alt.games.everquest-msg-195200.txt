I haven't had any such problems. I will admit that I haven't played much 
in the last couple months though. Still, a couple months does not the 
whole picture paint.

If you've ever worked on a large scale network-based software 
infrustructure you would understand the incredible number of variables 
involved - not the least of which is the possibility of human error. 
There is often a good bit of finger crossing going on when the servers 
are brought back up.

I guess that's another area where we just disagree. I don't see any of 
the recent nerfs as particularly "unbalancing".

Well, I'll just say that *I* haven't really found it necessary to get 
used to anything of the sort. I don't think I'm an exception either by 
any means.
