Ok, now we're getting somewhere.

A quick look at ATI's site shows that
they provide cards for many of the 
manufacturers that produce NLX formfactor
systems, so I fired off an email to their
support department asking if the Radeon
is available in NLX formfactor.  I'll
let you know what they say.

If none of that pans out, I see no reason
why you shouldn't be able to remove it
and use a pci GF2 instead.  When I built
my most recent system, I had purchased
a bad video card.  In order to verify that
it was the card, I swapped in the old
Banshee card I had sitting around, and it
worked fine.  As NLX agp appears to differ
from standard AGP in the formfactor only,
this should hold true for your machine 
as well.
