No its not. The prices are more or less arbitrary and voted on. You
can get the same thing at:

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/

They just don't let you list equipment by zone at alla unless you pay.
You can use the site just was well without doing it though by going to
equipment, slot, head, picking a character type, looking at the items,
etc.

Eqatlas.com and allakhazams are all I need and both are mostly free. I
was never impressed with EQmaps or prices when they WERE free. I just
don't go for the "you pay for content you and other players submit"
thing. I figure if they can't afford to keep a site up without doing
that, take the damn thing down and let someone else fill the niche.
