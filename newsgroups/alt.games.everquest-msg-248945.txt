Population density across the USA is quite a bit lower than that of
Europe or the Pacific rim, I'll bet. Broadband deployment costs scale
in large part by geographic coverage area. Low population density 
areas (read: low revenue potential per square mile) get left out 
of the broadband pie. Just simple economics.
