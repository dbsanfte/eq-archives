The fact is that quirky little personal nuances have a direct impact
on how much fun one has when playing the game.

>Telling someone to go melee because <you> enjoy it

I didn't tell anyone to do it because *I* enjoy it - I said that they
should play the way that they enjoy, and not let anyone else tell them
otherwise.

That's swell, and I'll keep it in mind in the event that someone
actually asks what they need to be doing. But looking at the chain of
the thread that I posted in, no one asked that - several people gave
their unsolicited opinion, and so did I.

Thanks for the stunning insight. As soon as I have a few free minutes
I'll make sure to post a response that meets your criteria about how
to answer questions that no one actually asked.

Meanwhile, go have a seat in the corner. Just ask Ben to scoot over a
bit.
