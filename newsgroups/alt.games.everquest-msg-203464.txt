I AM playing it. BUt they are screwing it up as much as SOE is
scrrewing this up. Eliteists one and all. If you ain't a senior player
you aren;t going to get to be one without sucking up the crap the
senior players want to let you have. Old Whiners. That's what all you
higher level players are. Whining about how hard life was when YOU
came up.......

It get's old. That's all.
