Hmm, I had forgotten about the Temple of Cazic-Thule. I'll definately have
to check it out when I get my next pet. I had been at the entrance a couple
of times with my rogue helping people get Tae Ew blood. (It sells really
well in the Bazaar too!) I doubt that my 49 warrior pet can tank them long
enough for me to dot them properly, and I know my rogue pet can't handle it.
:)
The Hole isn't a place I had considered as of yet. Should be fun to go
explore the Ruins of Old Paineel, as my necromancer is an Erudite. I've had
a notoriously difficult time in dungeons up to this point, but I guess I
could always get an HoV before heading it.

I've been on the boats of Dulak a bit. Easy fear kiting, and having a rogue
pet is nice. Experience isn't all that bad either. JPF is a pretty nifty
zone. I just need to avoid those tree-hugging druids and militant hippy
rangers at the zone-in. ;) (I spent 3 levels beating up the druids and
rangers in EC and WC. I don't know how found they'll be do see me.)
