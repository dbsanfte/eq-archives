I'd love to see magelos of the ranger Beal has.  My kitty's is pretty
up to date - With the exception of 10lb halas pies and Grobb Liquidized 
meat as food.

The only skill that is correct on the kitty is defense - and the ac is
still low for some reason.  Premium Magelo is sounding like a good plan
for the auto updating.  But I already have premium Alla - Is there a tool
there that automatically updates your profile?  If so I'll just use that
I think.
