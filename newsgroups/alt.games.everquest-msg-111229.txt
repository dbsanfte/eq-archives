30 should be fine here. I kited in SBM, here's a couple of things to watch
out for:

1st, kiting in the middle of the zone is asking for adds. lots of adds. Did
I mention adds?

2nd, Kerrans are KoS to wolfform (not a problem for you but druids beware).

3rd lots of green kitties aggro, so you really aren't safe from even those.

I tried to kite in several places and best place I found was as you enter
the zone, turn left, go past the Kobold camps on the left wall and there is
an open strip of land. I had good luck kiting along that wall. Yeah it isn't
100% safe, but heck, at least you are near the zone :)
