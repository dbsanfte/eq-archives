At 31 you should be able to solo Gnolls at Split Paw. If you are in need of
Plat in a full group you can work HGs in Rathe Mts. Kunark has some good
spots OT is decent exp also Dalnir 25-35 zone (been told 33% exp bonus) will
take you to 35 insane exp my 28 warrior soloing gets blue bub per kill.
Warning stay close to zone soloing casters are very deadly. Velious Iceclad
and the Tower of Frozen Shadow would be very good in groups. In GD you
should be able to solo Tazmaks or group for Kodiaks.
