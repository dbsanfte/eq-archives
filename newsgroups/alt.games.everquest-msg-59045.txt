How do you do the two rezzes on one corpse, thing? Are you doing a
ressucitate (sp?) first time, then a full rez later? I know we just had
a thread here on rez stacking, but I didn't really follow it.

Oh, and I agree on the key. I think all the higher level keys, say...
Seb and higher should be soulbound. Getting them is enough of a pain in
the ass. You can make a stupid portal tooth soulbound, and the Seb key
soulbound, they should all be up in that range.
