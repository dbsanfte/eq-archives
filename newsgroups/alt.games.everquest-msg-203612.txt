Right now, lessee.  I RP on-channel with the guild I'm
applying to join (which is an RP guild, but has a lot
of people who are, right now, too high for me to group
with).  I've RPed in /shout with two other young Iksar
in the Swamp of No Hope (mostly us bitching about the
scummy frogloks and the lazy guards).  I RPed with the
Iksar who was looking for spiderling silks and with the
50s-something shaman who was a member of the guild I
wanted to apply for.

Anyway, on a game like EQ, you're never really alone.
Well.  Not at the low levels anyway.

There is a form of RP, or character-integrity, that keeps
me hunting in the Lake of Ill Omen, because I'm a beastlord
fulfilling the tasks the Prime Patriarch has given me
(currently going after the goblin hunter javelins and
sarnak broodling fangs)... rather than hunting in the
Swamp of No Hope (for the quiet) or the Field of Bone
(for the better mobs) or somewhere like Qeynos Hills or
Shadeweaver's Thicket (for the loot... swirling shadows
still sell pretty well on FV, for example).

I'd welcome the chance to group with RPers, even casual
ones, but given the choice between grouping with people
who'd rather be entirely OOC (who use d00dspeak and
constantly talk about RL stuff) or solo, I'll pick
soloing.
