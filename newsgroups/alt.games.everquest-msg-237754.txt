Whereas me, I was hoping that the unusually-timed downtime meant that
they were fixing the "most quest containers fail to combine" bug, which
has only been around for a few weeks but is at least as rude in its own
way as losing an almost-dead mob.  I really got my hopes up when I ran
my alt at first and did a PoK "collector's box" quest, including the
combine.  But nope, my monk's shackle quest combine is still broken.

I don't really mind the downtime (much).  And I can even deal with "my
pet peeve" bug not being at the top of their fix-it list.  But I really
do wish that SOE would tell us what it is they DID fix.
