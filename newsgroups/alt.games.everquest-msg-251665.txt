I haven't used bolt spells that much (51 mage) but this observation is
new to me. I remember when my mage was starting out and watching the
flame bolt fly out and curve to follow the mob. neat Was a bit
disappointed when improvements meant that there was no longer a
visible bolt flying downrange.

I will have to see for myself. Fighting rockhoppers, I made sure my
pet wasn't in line of fire before casting. Blockage was one reason I
refrained from using my bolt spells. My ranger shot an arrow at a
greyhopper and a guard was walking through LOS and got hit -- uh, he
didn't like that at all. :)
