 Since it normally can't be proven that the mob that is living under the
world is the one that killed someone I doubt someone would get a res
claiming that. I reported it once and the only thing the gm did was to
kill the mob but I didn't get a res.

 Even non-stunnable mobs like dragons can be pushed. This is the primary
tactic against mobs that gate. If you push them while they are casting
gate their spell will be interrupted.

 Agreed. Try the coldain missionaries in Eastern Wastes. They'll
normally get off one complete heal then begin casting less effective
heals. Eventually they'll have no more mana and start to melee before
running off.

 Hmm. If so there aren't many. Green would be 45 and under (maybe 44). I
don't recall seeing many green con mobs in the planes. Just nitpicking
though. At 60 I've encountered some green con mobs I've had to feign
off.
