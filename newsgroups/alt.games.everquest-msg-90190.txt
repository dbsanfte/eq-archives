Please don't post in HTML.

The Tiger Direct dealie is for a GeForce 4 MX440.  The GeForce 4 MXs are
more or less clock-advanced GeForce 2's.  The GeForce 3 Ti200 is a much
better card than these...the 4MX doesn't support pixel shading or any of 
the other DirectX 8 stuff the GeForce 3 series added.  It does have
slightly better antialiasing, but the one you purchased won't have
sufficient performance to use it at any real resolution.

I'd cancel your order, were I you.  It's a bad card, and a bad marketing
move.  You'd be better off spending $150 on the Ti200, or holding out for
the lowest end GF4 proper at $200 which will outperform a GeForce 3
Ti500 in most cases.

Sorry to be the bearer of bad news.  :(
