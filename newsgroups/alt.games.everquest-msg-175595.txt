If its as hard as they say, and you have to focus your energies in a
specific area and considering that you can only have 1 character per
server, Im betting many wont want to mess with it. You cant be a good
bounty hunter and a jedi at the same time. Im sure MANY will start the
path, but give up with frustration (or so i hope). As for Ebay Jedis
(Jedii?), we can only hope that the amount of effort involved in
becoming a jedi will make it not worthwhile to Ebay one, aside from
those that become one and get bored with the game. I seriously hope
that the first person to become a jedi takes months of dedication and
play. Id hate to log in 2 weeks after launch and see even one player
jedi running around (but wouldnt suprise me).
