Welcome to the Ass end of the world =)

Off to the right as you zone in is the prince's way, off to the left is the
king's way (just my names for them)

Most named things down the prince's way are lower level, if you go down the
prince way, following the right hand wall, you'll end up in a room with the
smithy and foodmaster, the pair was doable with a 14 druid and 16 warrior,
maybe if you had a melee friend you could take it, our tactic involved
thorns and HEAL, because harmony doesnt work indoors, you could just mez one
and kill the other, but not likely without a melee class.

Also down the princes way is the pit fighter/ trainer/ jailer/ packmaster
loop, with 2 pit fighters, which are probably too high for  you at the
moment without a group, the PFs are off to the right as you go in the wooden
door that you see on the left as you come down the princes way from paineel,
off to the left as you first come in is some jail cells with just more green
kobolds, if you go a short way towards the PFs, then off to the left, this
leads to the jail cells with some named kejekans in one, a couple captured
erudite and a captured kerran in the other, the captured erudite/kerrans may
be green, but they ARE HOSTILE, do NOT sit to med in that room, the other
room with the named kejek is safe to sit and med.   Continueing around the
loop is a room with a LOT of rats in it, the packmaster spawns here, his
placeholder is a frenzied rat that will attack anyone who comes into the
room (low level rat), farther back in the loop is kind of vague, but there
is the trainer and jailer who you could probably kill, and then you come
back on the PF room, from the back entrance.

And last, but not least, Prince Bragnar himself.  An 18 druid, 23 bard and
19 warrior had a bit of trouble here, he HTs for 191 or so, so have a tank
to suck that up, some of his assistants will probably help him out, they
were about half green to me when we killed him (oh, and a 25 druid can solo
the prince and get loot), he drops a VERY nice int cloak, Cloak of the
Forlorn, 2 AC -3 wis(who cares?)  +3 int, +5 mana, +1 sv magic. (BTW, I have
one for sale on Tarew Marr =D) and a pouch of bone dice for some stonebrunt
quest.

Going the kings way, directions are a bit vague, there's pit fighters in a
room back here, that are on average 1-2 levels higher than the princes PFs,
theres the throne room, with the king and high shaman (king HTs also), a
room off to the side with the lorekeeper and rarely the warlord (and a
secret pit to batling caves, very bad place, you'll get nuked from all sides
by batlings, and have to do a nasty CR).

Past the throne room without entering it is a room full of kobolds that
should still be blue to you, and a big pool of water, in the water the big
guy himself spawns, The Muglwump.  Muglwump is essentially a mini-dragon, he
hits HARD, and has a lot of hit points, but a full group around 19-20 or a
pair around 25 could take him down, he drops a wiz/nec only robe, some
erudite sk only armor, some erudite pally/cleric only armor, a mage only
fishing pole, and an enchanter only hand item, all this stuff is no drop.

Behind Muglwump's pool is a secret tunnel with batlings in it, and farther
back, Krode the Diviner, do NOT go back here without a full group to keep
the batlings from nuking you into ashes.

Past the throne room, after going through it and out the door to the right
as you sit on the throne is the path to Stonebrunt, back here are 3 caves
with, the cave bat lord, mighty bear paw and the huntmaster, these are all
probably too high for you, blue at 25 at least, and bear paw kicks my ass
when he breaks root too much.

Enjoy your stay on the ass end of the world =D
