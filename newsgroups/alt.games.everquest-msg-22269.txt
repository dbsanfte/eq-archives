When I group with an Enchanter I try to arrange for a snare before he mezzes
(make sure you have a hotkey set up to let the Enchanter know that the Mob
has been snared). This allows for a little extra time when Mez breaks to
allow taunting, remezzing or fleeing in terror : > Snare also acts as a
taunt, so sometimes the Mob will come after you when Mez breaks instead of
going for the Enchanter, giving the Enchanter a clear shot at re-mezzing.

Use /assist on the Enchanter to see who is being targeted if there is more
than one extra Mob.

Granted this can be a tricky dance when multiple mobs are pulled, but it's
just one more thing that seperates the Druids from the dr00dz.
