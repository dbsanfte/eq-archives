AND I can wear it on my head and get rid of that silly looking Ivy
helmet.

Thanks, I was curious.  I thought the FBSS was faster, but I was
looking it up and found some contradictory info on the net, which came
as no surprise really.

Been trying to get the Hangman's Noose on and off for the past couple
of weeks, but we've been getting shitty luck on the spawn cycle in TT.
Either no named mobs spawn, or the crappy named ones that don't drop
anything spawn.  Got luck tonight and got not one, but TWO knobbed
warclubs to drop.  

Imagine how happy we were.
