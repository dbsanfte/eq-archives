I'm very new to these games so maybe i'm wrong but is the fighter/warrior 
class veyr boring?

I just finished playing and for the past two hours all I did in the group 
was get all the aggro and get hit. That's it, I might as well have not been 
there in terms of gameplay.

I just stand there, call on enemies with shout and get hit while everyone 
else kills them. Am I doing something wrong here? I thought a warrior would 
be a fighter who can dish out damage with his weapons etc. I don't bother 
attacking as there's no point and I need to keep my power for using shout 
etc.

After playing this character for a week I think I have made a big mistake 
with this class.

I'm very tempted to start a new character and aim to be a wizard, at least 
then I will be able to kill some things.
