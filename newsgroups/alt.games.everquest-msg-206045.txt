Way OT here, but, as I understand it, basically, now all foreign 
companies selling goods and/or services via the internet will be required 
to charge then same VAT that the domestic European companies have been 
paying all along.  This means that if you had a local ISP in the country 
you lived in, you should have had the VAT already included in your fees.  
If you used a nonlocal ISP, such as AOL UK from France, then you did not.  
The VAT applies to electronically delivered products, such as ebooks, and 
music downloads, and services such as ISP, probably EQ, etc.

As to the exact percentage of the tax, that depends on several factors.  
Any company doing ebusiness in the EU from outside the EU can register in 
any one EU nation, Luxembourg for example, and then pay the VAT rate of 
the nation, 15% in that case.  Alternatively, they can register 
electronically, and pay the VAT for the customers home nation, which will 
vary from 15% (in Luxembourg to 25% (in Sweden and Denmark)

Physical good sold via the internet were already being taxed as they 
entered the destination country, that tax paid by the recipient as I 
understand it.

How exactly EQ fits into all this, I don't know.  I would assume that it 
will be subject to the same VAT, and the percentage will be based on how 
SoE registers in the EU.
