I just started hunting in PoJ recently. The people I've grouped with each 
time consisted primarily of members of one particular guild. They seem to 
be decent and capable folk, making it an enjoyable experience.

One thing that I find strange though, is that each time I have joined them, 
one of their number has been the ML for the group. Cool, I thought, until 
it turned out that I had to leave before them on each occasion, not getting 
any of loot at all. Granted, once I was only able to stay for an hour or 
hour and a half, but the other time I was there easily for a couple or 
three hours.

How is this normally handled? If I have to leave too soon after joining, I 
feel kind of bad leaving them temporarily one short and don't really feel I 
*should* share in the loot, but other than that, shouldn't a /split happen 
when someone leaves the group? What's the commonly accepted protocol there?
