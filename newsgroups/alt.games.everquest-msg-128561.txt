Random like the /random command ingame. Sometimes it seems like you're
winning every roll and another time you lose rolls even on cloth caps.

Summoned pets can be between 5 levels and the stats per level are set. The
conning of your pet is only remotely efficient. Green/Lichtblue pets are
just balancing at the lower end levels of exp-giving mobs to you. A mage at
level 4 can summon pets from lvl 2-6 (not sure, will have to look up) so 2/5
of your casts are yellow cons, 1 is white and 2/5 are blue.

What disrupts perception is that when you have a yellow pet you kill so
fast, and level fast with it, that you only need 1 or 2 pets to finish lvls
4 and 5 and probably even 6. Having had only a yellow con makes you think
you're only summoning yellows.

Anyway, pets work differently then normal players. My lvl 60 water pet is
around lvl 47 or so normally but still manages to outdamage most 50+
warriors and knights in my guild (and maybe even non-epic monks). Quad 68
hits and 208 dam backstabs go a long way :)
