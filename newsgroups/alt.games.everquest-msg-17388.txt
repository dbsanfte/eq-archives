For some of their customers, yes, it's frustrating.  But I for one am glad 
that it is not -easy- to recover a mislaid username and password.  That 
makes it much harder for someone to impersonate me and say 'oh, I just 
lost my password, can you tell it to me, please?  Thanks.'

You brought this difficulty on yourself.  Don't blame Verant for taking 
reasonable security precautions.

After all, wouldn't it be much simpler if we just didn't _have_ passwords?  
Then you couldn't have lost it.  We should implement that right away.  
Not!
