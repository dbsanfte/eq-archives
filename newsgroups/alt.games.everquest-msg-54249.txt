I'd like to have you come over and check out all my Windows books sometime. 
It's just as involved as Linux, just a lot of it is hidden away from even 
the most knowledgable user. At least in Linux, you have the option of 
learning C and C++ to really learn about the OS, in Windows that option is 
totally unavailable to you.

Dishonest? Huh! Who's more dishonest? A company that *never, ever* releases 
it's source code, or a group of programmers that include the source in 
every distribution? And I don't know about you, but I know several Linux 
boxes that have run for *years* without a reboot. Show me a Windows box 
that can go more than a month. Foriegn to use? Perhaps, to someone that has 
little computer knowledge. More on this later...

Not that I'm calling you a liar, but I've never seen any windowsbox not 
lock up  or BSOD. You're either incredibly lucky or only used computers for 
3 weeks.

But never on Windows? Pardon me, but b*llshit.

Really? The person with a GEForce 3 and a TNT 2 have the same installation? 
People with Asus MBs versus Abit MBs have the same installation?

Funny that. I've had programs install new DLL's that trashed working ones 
and screwed up other programs in Windows too. Why have you never had one? 
Or more to the point, why do you *claim* to have never had one? Case in 
point... I installed High Heat 2001 and it insisted on installing DirectX8. 
Well, EQ doesnt' seem to like DirectX8 right now, cause since I installed 
HH 2001, EQ will occasionally crash to the desktop, something that it never 
did in 2 1/2 years. More later...

And whatever "anti-piracy" fixes they want to send you too. And since you 
can't ever see the source code, you'll never know, will you? Not only that, 
but ME hasn't had a decent fix from WU since it was released. That's cause 
they don't really want to fix your existing OS, they want to sell you a new 
one.

If you can use RPM to install it, there's not a problem, is there? 
Compliling it is something that casual users shouldn't have to do, I agree, 
but what Linux program that you REALLY want to use needed to be compiled?

Just like in Windows, one needn't upgrade unless one is having problems, 
right? So why bother?

And you've never had one insist on installing a newer version of DirectX or 
some other DLL that trashed your system?

Ye of small patience! :) At least in Linux, you can have two (or more) 
different versions of libraries on your system. And that's only an issue 
for programs you need to compile. Ever try to downgrade DirectX? Hint : You 
can't do it. The only way is to wipe your drive and reinstall Windows. Is 
that a good solution? I think not.

And 90% of the time, those programs install flawlessly. And to top it off, 
most commercial Linux programs install with no problems either.

So it's getting better. Good. And it seems to be getting better faster than 
Windows is.

As I said before, don't upgrade if you don't need to. My router/firewall is 
runinng Redhat 6.1 and I don't plan to upgrade for a while. It runs and 
runs, and only ever comes down when there's a power outage. Yeah, I should 
put a 2.4.x kernel on it for iptables to get the stateful firewall, but I'm 
too lazy, and it works fine right now for my purposes. 

And most commercial Linux progras *are* runthisthinghereblah.exe.

Hmm. Porting a game to Linux at this point might be a sort of non-profit 
endeavor, but it's a move that will endear certain companies to the new 
users of Linux.

If you don't have to pay ~$100 for the OS, that saves you enough to buy 2 
games at $49.

Any game manufacturer that makes a good game for Linux will see his sales 
going up steadily for the next few years, as more people start to realize 
that the best OS *isn't* the one they've been using.

Oh, please! The only reason that DOS and then Windows became so prevalent 
in the PC world is because IBM released the specs to make a PC, and let MS 
sell DOS to other manufacturers.

Had IBM bought out MS when they could have, Compaq wouldn't have had an OS 
to compete with IBM. Not to mention that IBM published the specs. Compaq 
did not "reverse engineer" the IBM PC.

Since Linux didn't exist in 1984, your point is moot. And if it had existed 
back then, you wouldn't even know the name Bill Gates.

So you say. Any evidence for this? I've seen 45 year old men crying over 
Windows problems. (Me).

Please... A federal court has already convicted MS of predatory 
monopolistic practices. When you tell computer manufacturers that they can 
have Windows for $5 a copy if they put in on *all* of their computers, but 
it'll cost them $98 if they leave it off *one*, that's using your power as 
a monopoly to *force* people to use your software. And I'm sure you're 
aware of their tactics in the browser war.
