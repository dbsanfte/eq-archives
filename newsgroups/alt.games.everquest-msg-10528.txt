Step one: get a high level character willing to waste his time
helping you.

Step two: Ask him how he can best do so.

Step three: follow orders.

you are really dependant on his whim here.

================================
Cleric PL

System one.  I buff you up and go on about my business,
you kill yellows and light reds till your mega HP wear
down, come find me and repeat.

System two: I almost kill something, then atone and you
follow it and beat it to death.

System three: I stand around and heal you while you
fight....or even just in between fights.

Oddly, system three does not require a higher level
cleric, one many levels lower than you may more than
suffice to drastically extend the rate at which you can
make exp flow

Ssystem four (not really PL) Group with a significantly
lower level cleric.  You get almost the same effect as
with the system three above, as the cleric eats only
a tiny fraction of your exp.

======================================
Enchanters have memory blur and can function
similarly to system two.

Other classes can do system two by pulling over near
a zone line, and zoning out while you kill the target.
