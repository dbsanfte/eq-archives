Now if that isn't that the sweetest little g00ber-t00d I've seen
in a while...

And you miss James' (and SOE's) point.  The fact that one in a thousand
melee twinks has a fungi, a CoF, a pair of better than 0.5 ratio one-
handers, 400+hp worth of gear, plus access to massive buff PLing on
demand, means that:
1) the DoT nerf must be undone, because everybody knows Druids, Necros,
and Shaman are too weak,
2) vast numbers of fairly easy to obtain spell focus items must be
dumped into the game, increasing the net power of all casters who are
not actually brain-dead by 10% to 50% (depending on level, class, play-
style, and in-game wealth/connections),
3) KEI's implementation must include a glaringly obvious hole in the
"can't be cast on low level characters" restriction so that all casters
can dispense with melee support, rather than just Druids and Necros.

SOE has been working "class balance" from the pov of the highest level
and best geared characters since RoK came out.  Because wealthy uber-
guilders like James can create ridiculous melee twinks those same
ridiculous twinks are used as the standard for class balancing.

You might as well just throw in the towel Larry, either that or change
your handle to Don Quixote or something.  ;)
