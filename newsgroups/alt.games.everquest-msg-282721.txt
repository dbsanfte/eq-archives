The UI engine will automatically fall back to the "default" UI for any
missing UI elements, so if you delete everything out of the
"default_old" folder that you don't need, your UI will mostly continue
to function with new updates.

To keep most of the old UI, keep these files (I'm paraphrasing from
memory here since I don't have an EQ install handy):

all the image files
EQUI_Animations.xml
anything with "Hotbar" in the title. (or maybe it's "Hotbutton")

I still get a red UI warning every time I log in, but everything works
as far as I can tell. I got the Auras window, and even though I'm using
a custom buff bar, the buff blocking works fine.
