Of course, he'd have to drop six of everything, in case he's taken
out by a full group and everyone there wants one of everything from
him.  Could be a bit much.  Plus, it violates one of the fundamental
psychological rules underpinning this type of game: random rewards.
Intermittent, unpredictable rewards are the best way to keep a test
subject (i.e., us) pecking away at the keys, hoping that NEXT time
we'll get what we really need.  (Sure, there are some mobs that drop
the desired item every time, but most are intermittent.  And many of
the ones that drop every time, the mob itself is one that spawns
unpredictably as you mow through placeholders.  Indeed, in many
cases it's both: kill PHs until the desired mob randomly appears,
then kill it hoping the right loot randomly appears.  Sometimes it
even adds another layer: you loot and find the right graphic, but
it turns out to be a Damaged X instead of a High Quality X.)

I'll grant that players might like it better if they got all the
rewards on the first successful attempt, but is that really the way
to keep them playing?  Well, it might be, if there's always new
content to explore.  But it's certainly not the way for SOE to get
the most mileage out of the content.
