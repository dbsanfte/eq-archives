I'm not saying it's not "Nature's way", I'm just saying it's not a
good thing when it does.

Some things just are not appropriate for that. Besides, I didn't see
much evidence of either other than a disclaimer thrown in as an
afterthought. "You know, I think your father deserved to die in the
9-11 tragedy. Aw, I was just kidding." It just doesn't fly.

If you can't believe that what you have to say may cause them to think
a little, and maybe even contribute to their re-evaluation of their

discussion is for. Otherwise it's just hot air.
