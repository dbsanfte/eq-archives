Yes, but there's little marginal value to the cleric epic. The raid
recovers in the same amount of time whether it has 2 or 8 clerics with
their epics. Limiting the number doesn't have any effect other than 1:
to piss people off with these horrible conflicts and 2: to slow down
some smaller guilds temporarily. Limitng the numbers does little in
terms of keeping wipeouts as a timesink, because there's probably at
least one epic in reach.

By margnal value, imean how they stack. The more rogue epics you have
on a raid, the better off you are (unless you're uber). Not so with
cleric or enchanter epics, for example. 

For that matter, isn't the rogue epic the one with the most marginal
value and also the easiest? If so, that's really poor design. I guess
maybe shaman or monk is easier than rogue.
