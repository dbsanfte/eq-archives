www.eqatlas has the maps of boat routes...btw Oasis route is for
Darkies...is ur druid a dark class? If not might be worth tping to
Butcherblock. the shuttles to Fironia Vie are easier than Oasis. Only way to
die that way is drowning. I know u cant tp yet and a druid paying for a tp
would suck seriously lol. but beg and plead someone will come always
happens. I got lots on an island on way back from FV to BB, its scary, but
boats will return after about 30 mins. what race is your druid?
