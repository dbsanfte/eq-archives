As part of my ongoing, longterm, carefully calculated plan to fully
ensure that I never have any money and never get a character to level
sixty, I'm shopping around for some gear for my level 25 monk, abandoned
these two long years ago.

(Ok, sersiously, I'm not switching mains again, but we have some lower
level members/alts in our guild that get together for some fun stuff and
I want to gear up my nearly naked monk respectably to go along and have
fun kicking things.)

Anyway, when trying to remember what little I learned about monks, I
contacted a friend with a level sixty monkey in one of our server's tier
two guilds. I asked him, quite simply, what stats I should look for on
items for my monk as being most important. Without a pause he responded,
STA and HP. Everything else is a distance second.

Ok... fine. I went out looking at some gear in the bazaar. Friend had
recommended looking at Black Panther. I looked. I gagged at the price. I
then looked at some reinforced acrylia armor for the same slots. It had
MORE of both STA and Armor Class and was way cheaper! 

So what's up with this? Something about Black Panther I'm not
understanding? What's some fair twink gear for under a few KPP that I
could toss on this guy to go kick around in?
