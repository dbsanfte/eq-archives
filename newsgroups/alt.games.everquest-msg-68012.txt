I'm running with everything on, and it works great in most zones.  It truly
sucks in some Luclin zones though.

I have:

PIII-800
768MB PC133 SDRAM
40GB ATA-100 IBM 7200RPM Drive
Win2k
crappy onboard audio
GeForce 2 MX400 with 64MB

In the kitty city, the frame rate is absolutely awful.  If I turn off most
of the options in the display menu, and bring the clipping plane way in, it
becomes mostly usable, but I would not want to try fighting.

Unless I missed something, my system is above the recommended specs.
