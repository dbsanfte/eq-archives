By all reports as the guild levels up the writs quests level up as well. 
So the system wasn't *that* "fatally flawed".

Good thing I never said that. I merely said if all you get from the grey 
grinding is the ability to display a tag then don't do it. Its certainly 
not something to get worked up about.

Its no chicken and egg. 

They made an -allegedly- stupid system. And you chose to play in it. You 
choosing to play it doesn't make it a stupid system. There is no 
circular dependancy here.

That makes your choice to play in it the more stupid.
