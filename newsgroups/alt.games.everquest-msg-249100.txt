And thats the key. There is a market full of total annhilation and quake 2
games for when you want instant gratification and a twitch fest. Homogonising
a game that had a genuine difference into them is idiotic, especially when
they have a product lifespan of less than half that of EQ. In terms of actual
playtime they become even more insigificant.

Like sometimes I want to ride a horse or go for a walk in the woods
instead. Sometimes theres a destination to be arrived at efficiently,
sometimes the journey is the point. Tell me, how do you feel about
road trips?
