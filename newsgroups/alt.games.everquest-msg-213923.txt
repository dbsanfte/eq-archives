This is a decent enough point, if you are squeezed for spell slots and need a
relatively cheap way to do a very small amount of damage, having a snare that
doubles as a DOT and isn't as expensive as your real damage spells might be a
nice benefit.

I wonder, though, if you had both a druid/ranger snare and a necro/SK snare
which you'd use the most often.  "I need just a tiny bit of damage and I don't
care how inefficient it is really" doesn't sound like all that frequent an
occurance.

"I'd really like this snare to stick" on the other hand, sounds a lot more
likely.  Particulary since necros don't get SOW
