I found a note about this same problem.  The other problem he was having
was, when logging on it would download the eqgame.exe file EVERY single
time.  The tech note I found also mentioned that and it was the CiH virus.
My donkey of a friend has NortonAV sitting on a shelf, collecting dust,
never installed.  Once we installed and quarantined virus (couldn't remove
it) it was ok.

Never seen that one before.  Verant claims it doesn't come from their
updates, that a previous infection does cause this.  Odd....

Thanks to all who responded anyway,
Sean...
