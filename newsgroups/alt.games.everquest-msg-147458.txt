It doesn't matter what *I* have done. ( By the way, I tried to enlist.
Medical history keeps me out, so kindly shut the fuck up on that point
). What the point is is that your attitude is outright disgraceful.

Hell, you'd think America was the only country ever to be hit by
terrorism with the attitude some people have over 9-11. Nevermind that
some countries have to deal with it on a DAILY BASIS.

It's horrible. It needs to be stopped. But can the "poor us" routine.
