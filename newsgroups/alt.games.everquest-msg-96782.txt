What I ment was have they removed the CR but given you res effects ?
Or do you come back fully healed and full of mana ?

If you come back with res effects (or simmilar) but no CR then this
sounds OK to me.

True, however I know at least one person who quit the game due to
multiple lost bodys at low levels, perhap VI did some research and
noticed that a lot of people quit before they even hit level 10.

I agree that people now wont be learning things till they are 10/11, but
with their bodys now lasting a week they should at least have time to
find them, and after a week long CR I guess they won't make that mistake
too many times.

Well it is at least half the issue.
If they just remove them then it is easier to get to 46 / 60
If they spread the load then it is still just as hard to get to 46 / 60

In some dark part of my soul I kind of agree, but in the end hell levels
are really just a PITA. If you still requre the same amount of xp /
effort to get to 60, but it is spread more evenly over the levels then
to me this is a good thing.

I know of people who either quit or started alts due to hell levels.
I'm guessing that VI noticed this trend.

Trust me I don't want it to be easier to get to 60.
I don't want my experience cheapened (I'm no where near 60 yet)

If they make it easier to get to 60 then I agree with you.
If they spread the load so that players level more regularly (not
frequently) then I don not agree that this is a dumbing down. I think
that it is "removing a feature".

I really don't understand your attraction to features that add nothing
to the games realism, fun, functionality, playability or roleplay.

I agree, but does removing the stare at a book for 35 levels make the
game much easier?
How often in 35 levels as a caster do you die cause you don't see a mob
while medding ?
I recon that my Druid (currently 31) has died perhaps 5 times due to
this.
Not that much easier if you ask me.

Snigger. I am trying ! But it has taken me over a year to get to 31 !

Tell me that you don't really think that these changes are more of a
move to monty haul than say AA ?
I'm definatly not for a monty haul game, but changes that make the game
more playable and rational with out removing the difficulty and chalange
seem to me to be good.

I'm still holding out judgement on the hell level removal till I know
just what they are doing. If it is easier to get to 60 sfter this, then
I'm with you, If not then other than some sentimental hang up on "rites
of passage" I really can't see what your problem is.

I have still not seen anything that says this is the case.
Unless you can confirm that you now require less kills to get to 46 on
test ?
If you can then I am alot closer to agreeing with you.
If no one can tell me that it is easier to get to 46 / 60 under the new
rules then the jury is still out IMOSHO.

Is it? 
I do not remember anyone ever saying that Hell levels were part of the
Vision.
I remember them saying that the could not think of a good way to remove
them, but not that they did not want to.

Ok, the no CR before level 10 is a slight dumbing down.
Ok, no more book makes a slight difference.

But I still don't see that any of these changes are primarily dumbing
down EQ OR making it significantly easier.

I can see that you think these changes are going to make EQ easier or
more trivial, but I don't agree. I think that they may make it more
rational and perhaps margenaly easier, but I don't think that the
changes (as currently stated) will turn EQ into Quake, which seems to be
what you are saying.

These are big changes, but until we know the details it is futile to
start shouting about how VI have ruined our land.

I have no fondness for Hell levels or the book, but I do want EQ to
remain a chalange, and if I hit 60 before 2004 I will consider my self
either very lucky, cheated or devorced ;-)
