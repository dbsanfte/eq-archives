What would you recommend I focus on? focus effects? HP?
While for a necro frequently HP=mana, the mana regen from
Dark Pact is low enough that mana is still sometimes an issue.
Much, much less downtime than a cleric of equivalent level, but
low enough that the HP gained from the Harm Touch series is
outweighed by mana consumption.

(Necro to level 12 now...)

You're right about the hunting grounds BTW... and there
are effectively three to choose from (LOIO, FoB, SoNH).

I have to say though, so far I'm deeply unimpressed by
the Iksar necro newbie quests. The apprentice skullcaps
so far are AC-only, and not much AC at that. They do
look nice though. :-)
