Take the boat to Qeynos and start hunting in the sewers. Get a map from
EQAtlas and hunt the area where there are smugglers and bandits.  You can
jump off the boat before it docks and swim down into a sewer entrance in the
water. Make sure you have plenty of food and water before you leave Paineel
and be sure to get a bind at from someone near the sewer entrance.  There is
a necro guild in the sewers so you can get your spells and train there. You
can level to16.
