Nothing you have now will be worth diddly-squat when you come back (if you
do); imagine how thrilled you'd be to come back now with a toon you'd
retired in Kunark - you'd be laughingstock of every person who inspects you
and the mobs will hit FAR harder than your gear will handle.

Sell your stuff and convert it to plat, and leave that on your toon.  If you
decide to come back, you'll be able to hit the baz and re-outfit with
current gear - because platinum never changes.
