Between POJ and POI (the factory mobs are higher level) we got him up to 
51.  Then went and did the POJ executioner trial, and spent about half 
the level in POValor and the other half in Sebelis (getting the key for 
him took much longer than I expected, when I got my own last fall it 
took about 10 minutes with no tracker, but it took us most of an hour to 
find a forager.) down in the jail and the shrooms nearby.  Both areas 
feature mobs that are easy for me to solo at 70, but between DB and 
yellow to him.

I still haven't seen an answer to my question about which zones have 
what level limits though.  I can figure out the POP ones easily enough, 
but running into that Ferubi line completely blindsided me.
