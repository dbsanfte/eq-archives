So where's your bitch here?  High-level guilds, especially guilds built
around raiding, already are packs of ravening demi-gods, leaving a path
of death and destruction in their wake.  Is it not right and proper that
"the gods" arrange to lure them away from the "ordinary mortals"? (or
immortals in the case of EQ, heh).  How much time does any guild that's
experienced with high-end Velious content spend in Antonica or Faydwer
or Kunark?  Hell, the highest end guilds are bored with Velious.  Go to
PoP and bitch about its content, the "old world" <should> be mostly dead
to you, you've been there and done that, it's time to move on.  Where
the hell is the attraction of doing the same damned identical thing over
and over and over and over and over...  Your whine strikes me as absurd
in the extreme, to paraphrase: "we've crushed the old-world beneath our
iron boots and now we don't get exp. there any more!  boo-hoo!".  Just
thinking about the way you (apparently) want to play, killing the same
mobs you've killed a thousand times before, but now you can squish them
even faster and without risk of having to wait 30 seconds for a 96% rez,
reminds me of the old description of a robot masturbating:  "efficient
and joyless".

Go to PoP!  It's been created for you <because> you've grown beyond the
challenges already in the game.
