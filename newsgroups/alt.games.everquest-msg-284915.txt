Getting to 102 tinkering skill was simple enough; I made Spyglasses till 
they capped out, and then Stalking Probes the rest of the way to 102.


Spyglasses were my real goal; equipping everyone in the guild with an 
insta clicky for dispelling mobs should be a big help.

Stalking Probes are less useful, but can still be handy for pullers and 
lullers, or for scouting by people (like me) who lack better means. 
Sadly, they have charges, so they can be a pain in the butt to use on 
any sort of wholesale basis.

Now though, I run into real frustration; I don't see anything truely 
useful for a long time to come; I'm stuck making junk.  Expensive junk 
(relative to my cash flow on a Combine account, where 1000pp is the 
equivalent of 100,000k on a regular server).

Looking around at my options, the cheapest one I could find was the 
Tinkered Catapult; even this little gem requires around 30pp in parts... 
but worse, one of those parts is a Shaped Ashwood Recurve bow, which 
trivials at 148 fletching.

I had a 110 fletching head start, so I decided to go with this instead 
of the more expensive Powered Gloves or something with a much higher 
Trivial... many other options are available but most require drops from 
SOL or later expansions, not yet available on Combine.

Arrows arrows arrows; I make them by the ton.  Fortunately, I can get 
away with the cheapest arrow in each trivial category, since I have no 
interest in the arrows themselves, other than filling up a bag full of 
range 150 ones when I happen to find some in a desirable trivial range. 
    Still, I blow thru quite a sum of money, I don't get back nearly as 
much as I spend on the parts.

Finally I run thru the last of a set of components with my trivial 
higher than that of the bow, so I start making those.  I get about 80% 
success rate on the 15pp part, and combine that part with another 15pp 
worth of tinkering gear to make catapults, which I sell back to the 
vendor at 28pp each.  That would be a 2pp loss per combine if it wasn't 
for the fact that I'm blowing about half of them between the making a 
bow and the making a catapult step.

Got my skill to 114 on this before running flat broke, time to go farm 
some cash.

What struck me funny, though, was a fletching combine I could do; 
fishbone darts.  To do this I'd need a dart making tool, which requirs 
smithing but since I'd only need one I could probably commision it 
rather than have to skill that up.  But then it requires fish bones, 
which are made from caught fish (or from bought fish and foraged stuff, 
but I have no foraging skill) at a higher trivial than the fletching one.

Funny, because I'd have to learn fishing in order to learn fletching in 
order to learn tinkering!

I'm lucky making Firewater is tinkering and not Brewing, I suppose.
