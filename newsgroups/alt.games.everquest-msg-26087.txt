In North Freeport, there is an annoying gnome named Zigg Flin.  My
Shadow Knight can wander all about North Freeport except of course the
Temple of Marr.  Sometimes as I'm passing that blue building he's in,
he'll come out and whack me for ungodly amounts of damage and by the
time i've managed to zone, I'm at 1 bubble of health.  Can anyone tell
me what faction he is aligned with?  I'd like to try to be at least
dubious with him eventually.

Thank you,
