Are they all under 32?  I think that's the actual cutoff point, but from a
level-60 vantage point a nice round "level 35" is easier to remember and
express when they're all green anyway.

If that's *not* the reason for his problems, then he ran into a truly
peculiar bug.  The *only* difference between mobs of different levels, is
the fact that they are different levels.  There are no "anti-feign" mobs
(well, except for those freakin chain-casting mushrooms in Luclin).  The
only time the level makes a difference is when the mobs switch over to the
35+ (32+!!!) scheme of aggro.
