Bah. My quadding is non-existant untill I get two more yellows and ding
51. There's an ugly gap in wizard AoE spells in the lat forties and
fifty where you don't get a usuable new quadding AoE DD.  So for 49 and
fifty I've taken to single pulling wyverns and spirocs and feasters (oh
My!). Plus a lot of grouping and some dungeon work.

But fear not. By tomorrow night I should be back in the saddle and, yes,
quadding at a rate that druids can only dream of.
