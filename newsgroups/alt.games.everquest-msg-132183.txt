Ken, I do disagree with you, and you are a newbie.  OK, maybe not a newbie 
newbie, but come on...  It's the equiv of writing Mayor Bloomber because 
you saw some grafitti you didn't like in the subway.

You sound an aweful lot like one Eugene Charles Doane.  And you're both 
Navy and have spent time in VA and AZ.  Trolling blood brothers it would 
seem.

You are confusing "public" with "free" or those with "technical knowhow".  
Cox distributes the public Usenet groups, because they are more a common
carrier than anything else.  They provide Internet (Usenet), bam, there it
is.  Like it or not, take it or leave it.  If you want to whine about 
something there are far better things to whine about.  Perhaps you could 
spend your time more productively volunteering at a soup kitchen for the 
Church of Jesus Christ, Latter Day Saints?

And what would that be that you think I'm entitled to?  Huh?  You're 
making about as much sense as the Mormons who trespass on my property 
spamming me.
