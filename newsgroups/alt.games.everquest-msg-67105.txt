And in fact, this is what we had to do. Before ripping anything out, I
had to reset the video drivers to "Basic VGA" or somesuch, which of
course totally trashed the appearance of the video, but it worked. Then,
rip out old card, stick in new PCI slot card, stick CD with drivers in
Drive F, and voila'! It worked.
