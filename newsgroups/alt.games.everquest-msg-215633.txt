Here's the thing.  SOE (and Verant before them) have always been vocal about
wanting people to group more.  Nerfs designed to discourage soloing got a large
negative reaction, but two recent ideas have worked better; 1) dramatically
increasing the group bonus, which previously didn't come close to making up for
the inefficiencies and time sinks inherant in grouping, and now 2) making an
entire expansion full of interesting content that for all intents and purposes
requires grouping

Thus, more people group that used to happily solo.  At some point, everyone who
starts grouping does so without previous grouping experience.

What you are seeing, people of all levels that clearly lack any sembalance of
grouping skills joining LDoN groups, is a natural consequence of this change.
SOE finally figured out how to make people group, but they can't go in and
change the whole world retroactively to make it work that way, so that means
that people of all levels are now grouping for the first time.

We get to bear the brunt of that, essentially turning into uncompensated
tutors.

If you don't like the job, what can you do?  1) Stop grouping with anyone you
don't know. After all, they might be grouping virgins.  2) group only with
guildmates, where you can either assume they must have some grouping skills, or
at least in the long run you can expect to benefit from training them.  4)
group only with people from guilds you know, decent ones.  Hopefully they'll
already have done the work for you, at least its a partial screen.  3) you
could look at their win/loss record on the leaderboard (never tried this, might
be wrong how it works) and take only people with at least a 75% win ratio.
This would imply that at least they personally aren't responsible for more that
a 25% fail rate, and heck, probably not for that many, given that there are at
least 3 other people in every group.  But even if they have a high fail rate,
if they've been in lots of missions then you can at least tell that they've
grouped that many times...  5) group with people outside of a LDoN environment,
where you can try them out without it affecting your win/loss record and
without being stuck with them for a full hour if they are really hopeless.
Good group, go take a stab at LDoN.

Just some ideas

Splendid
