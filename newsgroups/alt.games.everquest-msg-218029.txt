So.....a computer-run RNG is not truly random. Simply not possible to
code one that is. Using the same seed for an extended period results
in patterns forming. Re-seeding is needed to keep a closer
approximation to true randomness.

A side note on streakiness, it is entirely possible (though
astronomically unlikely) to roll a d20 100 times and come up with the
same number every time. When thinking on the slim chances of a streak
of x number of fails ( even if the range of results that would cause a
fail is 5 numbers ), also consider the tremendous amounts of figures
being spit out by the RNG every second in EQ.... The streak isn't the
RNG generating that result that many times in a row alone...its that
you happened to catch it at the moment it generated that result among
the thousands that many times in a row. The odds, then, of the streak
aren't nearly as slim (although, still slim) as one might think.
