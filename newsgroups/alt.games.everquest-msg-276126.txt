There is some more variation as you level.  Certain people get rare
drops, others get raid loot, and others get crafted armor from rare
harvests.  There is some differences at the higher levels, but not as
much as EQ1 yet.  There are some things I would kill for though... I've
only seen one pair of Squiggly Hide Pants (level 50 assassin bought
them off a vendor for 5g - almost made me cry), and only know of one
scout (50 ranger) that wears the Robe of the Invoker.

At the lower/mid levels everybody does the same quests, AQs, chest and
legs in RE, boots in RV, etc.  At the upper levels, people tend to
diverge in what they have access to, what they prefer, and what they
can afford.
