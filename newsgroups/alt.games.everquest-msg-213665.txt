While I can't be 100% certain this works for Ogres, my troll shaman was able to
do the epic steps in Freeport quite easily.  Use Invis to get up to the north
end of North Freeport, then lose it in the tunnel, the hand in mob wasn't KOS to
me.  Followed him out, a bit more trepeditious, but he never went near any other
mobs, ran thru his bit of dialog, then invised up and ran to the inn where I
knew he was headed to meet me.  Yes, on that route I did pass a couple mobs that
would have been KOS if they'd seen me.  Then upstairs in the inn, again back on
non KOS faction.

This makes a lot of sense, mind you, the mobs you have to deal with are on the
shaman epic faction ("true spirit"), not on any normal faction at all, and 90%
of the steps you will follow are nothing but a way of generating true spirit
faction hits, this is so true that you can skip most of the epic if you like
simply by doing some of the other steps over and over, your  goal being to max
out true spirit, then you need a drop from Fear and go do your final fight in
COM.

Of course you'll miss out on a pretty crappy shield and one of the greatest
items in the game, a pair of insta click SOW boots, worlds better than JBoots
and at a tenth the effort.
