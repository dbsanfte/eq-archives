Wow, I really must have hit one of your nerves! I haven't had someone
try this kind of silliness with me in weeks.

You'll find, I suspect, that this newsgroup will categorize what kind
of participant you are fairly quickly following this tactic.

Oh, and by the way, your constant harping about how I called myself an
expert is growing really stale - everyone is aware of your invention
in that regard. If you're half as bright as you'd like us to believe,
you'll find a fresher tactic.

Since you're keen on semantic arguments, you might want to give some
thought to what the phrase "this level of publicity" means.

>What did she do? Snip my text and call me names.

Which names were those? "Troll"? "Liar"? If you'll recall, that's what
you're calling me, not what I'm calling you. But with your knack for
inventiveness, it's no wonder you think I called you names.

Now sarcasm, yes, that I used.

>She is a liar and a self-delusional troll.

Whoops, there you go again!

>Come on Lokari--support you stance that the EQ password is so secure...

I did - just not to you. You might check my response to Tim Smith - he
asked a direct question in a polite and reasonable manner, and was
replied to in kind.

Your opening message to me, if you'll recall, was "I pity your
company. Further self-glorification deleted." You could learn a great
deal about civil discourse from Tim. But then, you could learn a lot
about it from a dung beetle.
