heheh and whoosh over your head LOL

Mezzing sometimes fails over and over for no apparent reason on some mobs
even after you lower their MR. Nothing to do with stealth nerfs, it just
happens sometimes that the roll check keeps working against you when trying
to mez. A little worse for this chap being a lower lvl.

Of course the original post could have been in "Irony" mode but I assumed
that this was probably not the case as the majority of posts are from our
American cousins and Irony is just something that they do not comprehend so
posted reply believing that this chap is being serious. Sarcasm yes to a
degree but not Irony )
