Thats the bad thing about AC hunting in SRO, the zone is pretty much accepted as
a FFA.  Even if you did petition him the most that would happen is a GM would
come by to try and witness him KSing, and of course since he already had what he
came for he won't be there.  To be honest tho, what do you really expect when
you are sitting medding and admit the mob may appear to be at full health..givin
the nature of the mob and zone isnt this a bit naive?
Reminds me of my first monk ID encounter.  I had just gotten to Iceclad and
started hunting cougars.  I see a cougar walking across my path in front of me
at full health, I cast......."your spell did not take hold" Thats funny.  Cougar
comes at me, I engage it.  I fear it and start to follow wailing on it. About
ten steps or so I notice a monk sitting on the ground (wasnt close enough to be
in my plane before)  and about that time he starts yelling at me for taking his
cougar, I apologized he didnt want to hear it.  - I realize your case was
different but you have to realize, there are KS'ers, and there are those that
set themselves up to be KS'ed.
