You have to keep in mind that this is a private company offering a 
service. They have EVERY right to make up the rules as THEY see fit. You 
have options about what to do if you don't agree with those rules. You 
can A. Hit the button and play .or. B. NOT hit the button and play. 
Mixing civic laws and rules in a game are pointless and irrelevant. You 
made an argument about "those who create the rules are not bound by 
them". If that is the case then MOST U.S. code would be ignored. An 
example if a private citizen is killed because of an employers shoddy 
safety practices then the company may be sued. If a citizen in the armed 
forces is killed because of shoddy safety practices they may NOT be 
sued. Same situation two very different outcomes.
