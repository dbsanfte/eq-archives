Well your forgetting the small fact that as a hybrid, rangers can cast
spells such as snare, root (best 2 spells in the game?), they can nuke, dot,
they can cast invis, see invis, SoW, regen, damage shields, HP buffs, they
can cast the best by far attack buffs (on themselves and others).. they are
the best trackers by far..

For those reasons alone AM3/EQ shouldn't be dishing out rogue-like DPS..

Or like me, you have a pocket shaman and primal avater (no gem component)
