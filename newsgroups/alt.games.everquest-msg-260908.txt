There was a big conference a while back where all these people like the guy
who writes mobhunter were invited, where it was promised that a new system
for the casual player would be brought in, since so many people had
cancelled their accounts when GoD was released in such a sloppy way. There
would be solo ldon's available. People couldn't see how that could work,
since many classes can't effectively solo, and were designed to be group
dependent very deliberately.

Anyhow, solo ldon's turned out to be so much vaporware. The announcement
from Sony was that tey would be replaced with the task system, which would
allow people who were time-limited to log in, do a few things, and log out;
people like myself, who have to work shifts and deal with real life issues
that don't wait. Star Wars Galaxies had the idea first; you would log in,
run a bit to deliver a package, then if you couldn't do it in the time
available, it would be there for you later.

However Omens for some mad reason decided that the task system would
allocate red mobs to mid level (30-40 is the range i've tested) players,
regardless of class. Unless you are a solo class (and even then in many
cases), red mobs are BAD. I expect some twinked people, especially if they
are being powerlevelled, will fly through these tasks but otherwise they are
irrelevant for the mid range characters sony claimed formed the bulk of the
playerbase. They insist most people are under 65 btw.

Meanwhilst, the task masters allocate blue and even light blue mobs to level
66 necros. The can solo these guys easily. I can see the marketing people
saw those people at the upper end as their real playerbase and the people
like me as expendable. Well, I am never going to get to that level unless
everquest is still around when i retire, and as far as i can see, omens was
sold on false promises, and unless they adjust that task system, i will
never believe them again.

A lot of people left because GoD was so badly done. I'm sorry to see I may
have to join them.
