It's actually far more specific than that, Ralph. But you were very
close to the mark. I called Miss Cleo's Hotline last night with just
this question, and she was able to channel the subconscious being of the
president of Sony Online Entertainment. It turns out that they have
implemented a long range plan to ruin the life of Ralph Henderson and
drive him insane, until he's living in a cardboard box under a bridge
overpass eating dogfood and begging for change to buy generic
cigarettes.

The level of pure unadulterated evil in that company never ceases to
amaze me.
