I think the arguement is not directed at sexuality per se, but
rather to the ability to bond with a mate, regardless of gender
or sexual activity; an asocial slob with the manners of a rabid
wolfhound might be capable of getting all the sex he wants by
frequenting the right sort of dive bar, but maintaining a
"girlfriend/boyfriend" relationship, even one that has no sexual
contact at all, seems to require "living with other humans"
skills.

Presumably DT's social skills, as demonstrated by his hair
trigger and balls to the wall atttack dog posting style would, in
Teckla's opinion prevent his ability to maintain any sort of
lasting relationship; this despite years of reports of abused
women all saying "he never meant to hit me, I drove him to it" in
unison.  

And despite DT's frequent asides noting that in normal EQ play
he's as gentle as a lamb, and only lets his dark side out on us
AGE'rs.  Is there any correlation between conversational
approaches here and in "real life?"   Or is this perhaps his
blowoff valve?  They say Don Rickles and Danny Devito are (were,
in Don's case) the nicest guys you'll ever want to meet IRL.

Then again, perhaps I'm just laying my ever so mature and
unbiased viewpoint on Teckla's rant, and he actually meant to
imply "fag!" as if that was relevant!

life, yet somehow is -still- married after 13 years (and another
3 in Texas)
