My shaman has none of his 64/65 spells, he does just fine.

99.999% of the game has been playing without a full spell book since day 1.
Why don't they bitch and whine about not having Ancient spells?

I mean, wtf be level 60 if you have no ancient spells !!

If you wanna look back in history too, about rare spells, in particular
class making spells, take a look at torpor for shamans.  Even now not
everybody has a copy of it.

Do you have a copy of group cheal?  No?  Quick, time to quit the game in
disgust!
