Guys-- thanks for all of the love last week.  Hope that you liked the
photos and trailers that I sent over.  This week, I've got more goods
than a mod on a PVP server. Just kidding, but there are some
exclusives for you below.  Be warned, however, that others will find
out about them in the middle of next week, so it's only yours until
then.

We also have a PoP contest running with a grand prize of a Sony 17"
flat screen (http://www.sonystyle.com/home/item.jsp?hierc=9683&itemid=51093)
and 2 first prizes of GeForce 4 TI 4600 video cards
(http://www.nvidia.com/view.asp?PAGE=geforce4ti)

I need you to send me the link to your site so that I can send you the
link to host the contest on your site or bb- but here's where we get
to have fun.

If you can put a link and small banner up for the contest, I have an
EQ T-shirt for you.  Easy as pie.  If you know a fellow Norrath
traveler that would be interested, ask them to email me, and the offer
stands for them as well. Ditto for their friends.  And so on. Until,
of course, I run out of shirts.

That said,  please email me if you'd like contest details for your
readers, and I'll get them to you ASAP.

Best,
Jason
