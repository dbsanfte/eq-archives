I solo a lot with ol' Pooch.  Here's our system.

First off, when entering game, immediately tell him to follow me.  :-)
Heh, though that seems to be the default, it doesn't always seem to
happen and I've lost Pooch within 1 minute of starting...

Go to pulling spot, issue a /pet guard here (not ME, but HERE).
Go pull with DoT or throwing item.  
Don't let the critter smack me in sight of the pooch - that's why I
don't pull by getting close and smacking the mob.  If the pooch does
comes running from his spot on the way back, I start smacking 
/pet back off 
repeatedly until we're all back at the pull spot.
By now, Mob is smacking me and pooch will dive in, rarely need to use
/pet attack.  However, if no aggro before reaching pull spot,
sometimes I'll send in the pet before the mob actually reaches me,
stand back and DoT or med for a minute, then wade in.  In soloing, ol'
Pooch is good at keeping aggro.

This method works well when I'm pulling for a group as well.

Hope that helps.
