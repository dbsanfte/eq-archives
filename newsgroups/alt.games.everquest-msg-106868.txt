 If it's an active officer they know who deserves it first. That's their
job.  It's not like KEI is such a rare drop that's the only one you'll
be seeing in the next three months. The spell benefits the guild as a
whole, I don't see the other 2 enchanters getting pissed because they
didn't get it. If they are they can deguild and find a guild they feel
awards loot in a manner they find more fair.
