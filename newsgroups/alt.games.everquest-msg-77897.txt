Basically, those two questions are tied together... eqprices is wildly
innacurate. Allakhazam's is a bit better, but not much. Basically, the
only place to get good price checks is EC, from people who see lots of
the items go by in any given week.

I wouldn't go as far as call it "unethical", but it's cheesy as hell.

> 3. Would you use such a service?

Well, no. Fortunately, I also have two computers.
