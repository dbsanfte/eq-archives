First off find out if your server has a calander for Raids. Many of
the older higher population servers require you to schedule in
advance. You don't want to show up in guild strength only to find out
that another guild is already there or the zone was cleared shortly
before you arrived.

Next, find out when the next Hate raid is being planned, and see if
you can tag along (try to bring a few of your guildmates as well). The
best way to learn about the zone is to experience it with people who
are familiar with it.
