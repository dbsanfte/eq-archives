I'm not sure how a straight roll system can be abused. In the short term 
it could be irritating to see a one-time show walk away with the 'good 
loot'... but statistically overall its fair. If you show up to most 
raids you will win the most rolls... over a long enough period of time. 
(Not that I'm endorsing it as a plan per se, but it *is* fair.)

On the flipside... we know a number of ways dkp bidding can be abused... 
starting with the much discussed price fixing schemes subgroups (classes 
or groups of classes) within the guild will perpretrate...
