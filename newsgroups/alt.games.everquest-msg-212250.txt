This should be an easy one.

If I group two characters who should not be able to group (let's say a 55
necro and 7 wiz), the way I understand the workings of XP is that on a kill
the XP gets split, the wiz's XP gets tossed into the bit bucket (since he's
too low to group with the necro), and the necro gets assigned his split of
the XP.

But .... would the group still get the grouping bonus?  And would it make up
for the percentage tossed aside?

I'm not sure how that works, but I have great faith that someone does.

TIA,
Crash
