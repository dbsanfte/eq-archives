Prices go up, it is a fact of life.  But nearly 30% is quite a large
increase in anyone's book.  I would love to get a 30% increase in my
monthly intake, after all my operating costs are now higher  =).  I
think the last contract at work covered a 5% wage increase.  We were
all happy with that.

Verant wants $3 per month from 420000 accounts (if the numbers are
correct) that is one hell of a monthly cost increase they must have
to cover.    But like I have said before business is out to give you
the least you will accept for the amount you are willing to pay.  I
am still willing to pay this cost increase at the moment, but I am
fortunate I can just raise the rents on my rental property.   Let me
see I have 6 units so everyone gets a .50 rent increase to cover my
costs.  hehe.
