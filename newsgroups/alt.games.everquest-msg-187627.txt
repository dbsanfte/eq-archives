I wholy agree with top posting, if your news server does not have the entire
thread then read below, if it does and you are a dumbass and start reading
in the middle of the thread then I got nothing for you, if you are reading a
thread and can't keep what you are reading about in short term memory, then
you have other problems. Bottom posting just asks for pages of repost with
nothing but "good job" or even worse a complete repost because you hit the
send button and now I scroll to the end to see nothing at all.

Bottom posting would work if news readers did not automatically quote the
message for you and you had to actually copy, paste, and format...........
