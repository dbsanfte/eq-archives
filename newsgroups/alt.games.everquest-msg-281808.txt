15/tick is the cap for mana regen (unless you have the AA that raises it.
you can increase the cap to 20 this way).

I was under the impression that the cap for worn hp regen was much higher.
40hp/tick, maybe?  I could be wrong on that.

This is the max from items.  It's a bit confusing, because tribute counts
as items, and some items have effects that count as spells rather than worn
effects.

Yup, spells are over and above the worn regen cap.  AFAIK, there is no
cap on spell regen.
