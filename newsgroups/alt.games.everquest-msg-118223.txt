I picked up the Luclin expansion this weekend, and it was a bit of a
pain getting eveything tuned. Had to try different texture settings,
turn models on and off, and upgrade my NVidia drivers, but I must
admit it was worth the effort.  Characters, spells, textures all look
really cool now.  Sound effects are much better too.  Thunder, rain,
etc.
