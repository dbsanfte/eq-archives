Or until SoE flips the off-switch on the servers? As i told 42, and
which i'll leave the thread at that, we just think differently. It has
been a marvelous thread imo though :>.

Oh... i said.. i get it :>. But at what point does a 'hobby' cease
being just that? How real does a world have to be before you can no
longer tell the difference from this one? And if you can't tell a
difference, in any type of stimula.. from this world to that.. is
there one? An architect can dream a wonderful house.. sit down, design
it, and have it built somewhere in this world. Its a marvelous mansion
with many rooms.. each with their own distinct theme. Its something
neither you nor 42 would ever call anything but real. Do the same
thing on a computer constructing it with bits and bytes with a 3d
interface into it, and suddenly we start talking about tiaras and
paper wands. Its not like new concepts of how we view things haven't
been pillaged before. The earth not flat? Ridiculous! The earth not
the center of the universe!? Heretic, stone him!

As i told 42 though.. I just view things differently. You can either
sit around making jokes trying to cover your insecurities, or accept
that it is simply my point of view and move on.
