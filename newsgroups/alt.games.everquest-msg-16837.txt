What a small little world we live in.  I have had a run in with him as well.
Not quite the same as yours, but I was new to the server and trying my luck
in BlackBurrow with my new necro.

It was my first time in the dungeon and I didn't have a map of it yet so I
was a little nervous.  Here comes this guy telling me to go into the tree
(the one with the pit trap) because there is a great spot in there.  It just
sounded weird, he was really pushing me to walk in.  I asked an ogre warrior
(he was level 30) if he knew where it went. He didn't, but walked right in
and fell into a tougher room - I wouldn't have survived.

That is one person that I will not forget or have anything to do with!
