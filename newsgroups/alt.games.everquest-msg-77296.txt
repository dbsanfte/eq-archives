Well, actually, it's pretty fucking easy to set up a simple news server 
with local groups if you don't care about propogation.  It's built into 
almost any server OS now (2k, XP, *nix), and has been simplified enough 
that really anyone who is familiar with admining servers should be able to 
make it work.  There are issues with moderators and cleanup and archiving 
that are rather non-trivial though, especially if your guild officers 
aren't all computer folks.  
The real issue though is finding a place to host something your server.  
You'll need your own physical server, and either a hosting facility or a 
good, solid, reliable, high-speed connection.  And no, most cable/DSL 
connections are nowhere near reliable enough for this.  If you have a 
guild member with a real T1 to his house, you might be in business.
If you're seriously interested in doing something like this, find the 
local hosting company that sells Cobalt servers or some other small, 
cheap, 1U server and price it out.  You'll drop about $1000 for the server 
(Cobalt used to start at $999, not sure the pricing now that Sun owns 
them), plus probably $100/month for the hosting and bandwidth.  It's not 
outragously expensive, but a LOT more than what my guild is paying for our 
pop-up free EZBoard site.  (We just had a guild fundraiser to cover site 
costs, in the 12 hours the request has been posted, we've had $245 
donated, should cover us for the next 5-6 months.)
