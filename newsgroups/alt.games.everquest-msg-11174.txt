Ya thats the trade-off for being the best pk'ing class :)

If you've got jboots you can solo from 1-60. I've solo'd my wiz from
1-35 so far, and I know plenty of wizards that have solo'd to much
higher (recently a wiz who got level 60 in skyfire, solo).

It's not that hard if you put your mind to it..

Well you said before that you had trouble...

Yes it was like that for...the first few months of release. DB was a pk
guild for most UO, and when it came to RZ, it tried the roleplay thing
for a few months. Then we got a new leader (old Ever, I believe), and
they started to pk people at treants in sk.

As for they couldn't compete...well they could...because they made
themselves further kos (basically to everyone), and now we are one of
the oldest guilds on RZ, and STILL kos to everyone. And STILL defying
all the sheep predictions....ie DB is gonna be banned...DB will never go
to the planes...DB will never have an epic (we already have someone with
an epic...although they got it with another planar group....but one of
our druids has almost completed his epic being DB the whole time...not
bad when we get trained every time we try to kill any named mob).

Who would have thought pk guild could have become like this? Now we have
a 60 druid, 59 necro, two 57 druids, two 56 wizards, a 56 druid, a 55
mage, a 55 druid, a 55 chanter, three 54 necro's, three 54 druid's, a 54
chanter, a 54 sk, etc etc. But I guess we "couldn't compete" huh?
