Yeah they might have several people using the account or just have
more than one computer to plevel their char. One way of doing it is
pullling max xp critters for the person and nearly killing them then
atoning them or such and then the person finishes them off. A few 55 -
60 level players can do this for anyone if they take the time, you
just need to be friends with them or be controlling all characters
yourself to get them to take the time. Pling in that way is way faster
than having the char played 24/7 which would be insanely slow.
