Been playing EQ for a wee bit too long have we and forgotten most other
games are just about having fun and not sitting down to a deadly serious
second job? Or did someone just piss on your Weetbix this morning?

Delta Force (original) was just a huge zerg rush brainless killfest. You

people would have to that was to laugh. Remember humour?
