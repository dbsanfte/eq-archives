Perhaps they're a big enough ISP network 10 might not be big enough. If 
a major ISP were to NAT their entire userbase they might very well need 
more private address space than has been allocated.

16 million addresses is big... but a Verizon or someone like that could 
use it all and more.

IPv6... the sooner the better.

Its not really hijacked if its NATed. In so far as the legitimate users 
of the public address space will be entirely unaffected by it. However, 
the NATed users will likely have problems reaching servers etc that 
might be hosted at those public addresses.

It might be interesting to challenge the ISP by finding some need to 
reach someone at one of the 'hijacked' addresses (ie his ip address), 
and then when you can't make a stink through tech support.
