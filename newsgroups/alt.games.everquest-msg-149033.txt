I'm not knocking the 8500. It is a great card (mine is in my second
PC). The GF4ti3200 is faster and offers the same image quality for
nearly the same price. That is why I recommended it.

You can buy the GF4ti4200 128mb online for less than $120.00USD.

If DVD playback is important then go ATI all the way. (I only play
games on my PCs)
