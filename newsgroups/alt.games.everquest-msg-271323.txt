Oh, in a group - it's very rare I can find green++ mobs I can solo
(most recent are zombies in Stormhold).

I'm looking forward to the big upcoming patch, as they say they've
added lots of solo quests and content, as like you I find it very hard
to get loot or xp, since level 18 or 19.  In fact, I'd say out of my
last 5 levels, 3 or 4 have come while grouping.

It wouldn't be so bad if there were SOME big quests you could solo,
but it's all little crap, like the Trapper in Thunder Steppes who asks
you to kill 10 animals.  You get about .25% per kill, and less than 1%
for the quest reward.

Most of the quest you get post-15 or so require you to kill ++ mobs.
Or a pair of + mobs, or 4 normal mobs.

I wouldn't mind as much if there was the occasional ordinary mob to
kill, as you can still get it done on your own, just slower.
