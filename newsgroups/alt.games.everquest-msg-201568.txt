Boon adds what, 100 dex?  Its an insanely high figure, and thats what it
requires for you to really notice any procing difference.

Yes they summon.  Been 1 grouped at 60 by shaman, necro and SK.  I don't
know druids to say outright (im sure a skilled 1 could)

I meant the upgrade ones are fine :)

Yeah thats it, my mind was blank at the time.  Spiked seahorse spine is a
good choice.  In the (likely) event you dont find a white dragon helm, you
should be able to find a cowl of mortality for 90-100k.  36% haste, 50HP,
head slot.  Its pretty nice just for the HP in its slow (compare other
droppable head items for HP)

Depending how fast that 600k goes, keep an eye out for stonehide pants.
They are 100HP (like AoW pants) but half the price for some reason.  Pretty
rare to make/see, but they are out there.
The CT ones are 90HP I think.
