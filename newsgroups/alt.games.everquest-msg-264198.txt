As long as you're taking ideas to present to SOE, here's one I thought
of tonight as I fumbled my hotkeys for the umpteenth time:  How about
a slash command that changes which set of hotkeys is selected (the same
effect as typing shift-digit)?  The benefit of this would be that you
could have a hotkey that, in addition to whatever else it does, changes
to a different set of hotkeys.

E.g., I have one set of hotkeys that do /memspellset for various spell
sets.  The problem is, after I mem the spells, I often end up running
off without changing to another set of hotkeys.  So I hit what I think
is my Tracking hotkey, and suddenly I sit down, clear all my gems,
and start memming new spells.  This is awkward and can be fatal.

Similarly, I might switch to my hotkeys for speaking LDON destinations
to the Magus.  Once I invoke one, unless I'm very quick, I don't have
time to switch hotkeys before he ports me.  If I arrive in Everfrost
and get attacked immediately by a passing mob, I might lose track of
the fact that I still have my Magus hotkeys up, and that can cause
trouble in the combat.

Anyway, it's a small thing, but probably pretty easy for them to add,
so I thought I'd bring it up. :-)
