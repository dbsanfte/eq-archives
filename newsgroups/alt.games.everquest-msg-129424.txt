Don't listen to the nonsense that people are telling you that Wizards are
the only ones who can get crits.

Clerics get crit heals AND nukes, druids get both crit heals AND crit nukes,
Necros get Crit lifetaps, Paladins get Crit heals, hell, anyone with mana
can crit, and anyone who uses a weapon can crit.

The caveat is this:

You must be level 55.
You must spend 6 points in "General" Alternative Advancement skills (Run
Speed, Regen, whatever)
Then you must spend points in either spell casting fury (Crit Nukes) or
Healing Gift (Crit Heals), for them to occur in any frequency you should get
to level 3, which is spending 12 points (i.e. 12 levels of exp at the rate
of level 51 progression).

After those have occurred, you indeed can crit nuke or crit heal and not be
a wizard.
