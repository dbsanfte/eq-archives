     I don't know if this has been posted here not, is so, please
forgive the redundancy.
   Even if you're not on Brell, check this out.  This thread is 69 pages
long at last look, and presumably still growing.  People from many
different servers have shown up to see the show.  And it deserves the
fame.
    Read through to at least page 8.  When you read page 8, start paying
attention to the names of who is supposedly posting what.   Do not be
eating or drinking anything when you read page 8.  Do not read page
eight if  you are in a position where laughing out loud, very loud, is
socially inconvenient.  I guess you can skip ahead to page 8, but then
you wouldn't have nearly as much fun.  And it _is_ fun, especially if
you are a fan of scooby dooby do plots.

May wrap.  Worth the trouble of cutting and pasting.
