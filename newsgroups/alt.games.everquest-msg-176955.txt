Go up the stairs and you'll be in a room with four doors.  Don't open any of
the doors.  At the top of the stairs, to your left, there are secret
passages through the wall that will let you back out into the graveyard
area.

If you have an invis potion, use it.  Hopefully you are sowed.  If you get
into trouble, just run out of the graveyard gate and stay to the left until
you come to the pond area. Go around the water and run up the pass to the
zone.
