When I was jerking around with that agnostic enc to see what their faction
would be in Runnyeye, someone twinked an Orc Pawn in the FP newbie area.
"An Orc Pawn hits <?> for 18 damage"
two or 3 times and the cleric I was hanging with was is dead.
"An Orc Pawn hits you for 18 damage"
two or 3 times and the cleric I was with is dead.

Kind of wish we could have killed it.

A low level twinked barbarian that was being PL by two other characters
killed it. Barbarian didn't respond when I asked what weapon he looted from
it.
