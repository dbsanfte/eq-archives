"blue girl with white hair, red eyes, black eyed mascara and a three day
growth" dropped her cheap wine bottle and slurred:

Troll score 2/10. You lose major points for being so obvious. Top posting,
not snipping and being offensive? Tsk Tsk. The trick to trolling well is to
be well spoken, coherent, but offensive. Even better if you throw in some
political incorrectness or rascism.

For example:

"Hmmn, I have always suspected that Blue Girl with White Hair's behavioural
instability may be cocaethylene* driven, but then again, maybe she is just
an American female... "


* - Cocaethylene is formed by the concurrent usage of alcohol and crack
cocaine.
