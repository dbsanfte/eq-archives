Well if that's policy then its time to start a guild and take over the
world via petition.  Simply petitioning is considered a guilty verdict
and so by petitioning everyone in a given zone I can clear it for my
guild?  Insanity.  I'm inclined to believe that the folks hanging about
invis had a documented rep as ninja looters or trouble makers of some
other sort that led the CSR to ask them to leave on an assumption that
they would repeat their offenses.  If in fact it is guilty by accusation
alone then they are enforcing one part of the policy at the expense of
another which says that all players are welcome to enjoy all parts of
the game, no one can claim an area for themselves and exclude others. 
Being able to skirt that policy by claiming to "feel harassed" as
opposed to actually being harassed is so silly it stops being funny.
