Yeah, stuff cut. I think more than "tanking" ability he meant can take
hits. Shaman's in their 50's can have AC that rivals that of the real
melee tanks, as can clerics. Its kind of funny my cleric at level 37
in cast off stuff (nothing I really bought just for her or camped for)
has the same or a bit better AC than my 55 druid. The other day she
was beating down gixx, not getting scratched, while a druid her level
in what looked to be good druid gear got folded by him in nothing
flat.

You are right though about the "hybrid" shaman thing being
exaggerated. I think verant did that long ago sort of while in reality
they melee and have the defensive skills on the same table as all the
priest classes.

The funny thing is people don't learn, now they think that from what
verant said that the beastlord will be inbetween the priest classes
and a hybrid but I'm betting it won't. I mean, it has possibly one of
the buffest pets in the game AND heals for it which meet or exceed the
healing power of a cleric (but for its pet only) That pretty much
means its pet is supposed to be the melee and tanker. Beastlord will
be a wimpy priest class like rest but who might be able to fight with
hands instead of a weapon.. but its melee will still suck it I wager.

Yeah I played a shaman on a server up to 30. What I found was that
from 29 on it was a LONG HAUL where it was nearly impossible or quite
hard to solo effectively. I KNEW that at 34 I'd rock with the pet but
I just could not make it. I started a druid on a new server and never
looked back (the server my shaman on was the since retail Solusek Ro
and it was just horribly crowded at the time so I escaped to tribunal)

Now that I know the game better I'm going to be a kitty shaman, which
could possibly be the best/easiest since supposedly they will have
more good factions like the barbarian, infra like the other shamans
and racial sneak and safe fall which of course NO other shaman races
get. That will be a great combo since on its own a shaman does not get
regular invis until 29.

I'd actually say that DE might be the best cleric, all around. It has
the second highest wis (along with the dwarf, both at 118) but has a
lot more options than people think as far as where it can go and where
its not kos. At level 37 with not a horrible amount of faction work,
I'm allied with north freep pallys (possibly one of the few dark elf
clerics with the paladin guild testimonial), up to glower dubious with
the clerics there (which is why I'm allied with the pallys.. THAN YOU
one use halfling mask!!! ), allied with dismal rage in the east freep
sewers, allied with the qeynos good cleric and pally guilds (and a
trainer from there is in one of the first huts in East commons.. so I
have SO many training options) and now finally indiff with Primordial
malice (started at glower dubious) who are those new dark elves at a
fort in Mtn rathe. I killed gix and dorn until I went from amiable
with them to indiff and app ( I think they are both on indigo brother
hood or one is on the dead) then when I got back to mountains of rathe
I was indiff ;) So now I can also train with primordial malice in mtn
rathe.. bhahha. Very low level with help, or around level 25 without,
the dark elf cleric can get a 7ac 3 wis 10 mana neck item that snares,
at level 37 I still use this regularly and can solo some blues okay
(although its not worth it for downtime.) This cleric also has racial
hide which makes you unseen while medding as long as you have a con to
check (only the halfling has more of an advantage with racial hide and
sneak)

I just always found it ironic that the cleric people think would be
the hardest is really one of the best and has very wide options as to
where it can go and train.

Hmm that reminds me. Verant is changing the ogre model for kunark into
a more evil looking not so dumb model. Or anyway that was their
intention, what you really get is a big giant baby model or retarded
guy that is a laughable joke. It totally ruins the ogre look taking
away all of its charm and humor. They said they are doing it because
ogres are going to have some story thing about coming back into their
roots as a power to be reckoned with that is no longer stupid (they
started that way then were struck down and made dumb by the gods when
they got too much power) So I guess the new models and backstory might
cause some different roleplaying than the big dumb basher, or we may
just hate them.
