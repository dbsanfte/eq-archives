No one can force anything on you bizz.  I know you have your narrowly
defined world that you believe is the one true way, but I assure you
there are many ways, all equally true.  If someone builds a game with a
system that you find odious, do not play it.  I repeat, just don't play
it!  All games should not be forced to follow what you define as being
the sort of game we all should play.   Choice is the key, more choices
mean more folks can choose what they enjoy.  If such a system keeps
those unwilling to make such efforts out of the game I play, then the
game will be better for their abscence.  Aiming for the lowest common
denominator,  only asking what your laziest and stupidest players will
tolerate, means we all are stuck playing lazy and stupid games.  Some of
us are interested in more than that.
