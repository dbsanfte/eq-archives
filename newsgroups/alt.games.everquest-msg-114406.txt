Who's to say this was the only incident that prompted her to leave?  I
think we've all heard horror stories of juvenile guilds where a core
group demands everyone else pay -them- for the privilege of being in
their oh-so-cool and most uber-guild.

You get to a certain point in your life and you have no trouble
walking out on people who just use you over and over for their own
gain.

I'm more concerned that this guy would take an internal guild issue
and make it public.  To his credit, at least he didn't post server and
char names - that would have been really scummy.
