I play a lot with a RL friend of mine who plays a shaman. He has the
first level of spirit call and from what I've seen the damage output
isn't really too impressive but I guess every little bit helps. What he
says he likes most about the ability is that when he's soloing and
something goes wrong (adds or whatever) he can buy a few seconds to run
away by casting his pets since the mobs often stop to chew through them
before coming for him.
