From the first posts of yours I always thought the same thing.  You're a
casual player with hardcore aspirations (At last count, my pocket cleric had
more and better AAs than you, and that's a year old twink).  Honestly, if I
were you I'd consider myself lucky to have seen and done as much as you
have.  And if your guild folds and/or you decide to go in search of another
one, you will have to resign yourself to the fact that the guilds that would
be accepting of your schedule will be several steps back in progression from
where you are currently, unless you wanna change your sleep schedule and
raid with the Koreans.

And there aren't many guilds that aren't currently having issues, or will be
by the end of November.  I predict many consolidations across all servers. 
It will be interesting to see how that all shakes out (I know the #1 guilds
on more than a few servers have been decimated already).
