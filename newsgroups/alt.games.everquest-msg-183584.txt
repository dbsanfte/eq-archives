Living Walls (Very, very creepy... They absorp the life essence of the pc's 
they "eat", and use their weapons and equipment to "attack and absorp" 
other pc's who are unfortunate to come close to it)
Vampires (I havne't seen any, but the quest do UNDO vampirism with some NPC 
*could* be nice, if they wouldn't screw it)


Well thats about it, seems like its been a LONG long time since I've read 
the Monsters manual ;-)
