It's always been a deathtrap up there if you're not prepared for lots of
casters.  This means having decent resists, which most people of level to
get exp on that floor, don't have.

On a sidenote, the sirens in CS are utterly gimp now, I killed about 30 of
them (no hair), never got charmed, got mezzed once, nuked maybe 3 times,
tashed about 8 times, with 94 MR; exception being when one siren nearly
killed me because she opened with a dispel that took my MR buff, then landed
tash.  28 MR = bad, then proceded to nuke the crap out of me.
