Don't compartmentalize yourself into healing/battle cleric stereotypes.

Crystalline Torque until you can find a Mana Pres IV item.  This will take

Crystalline Spider Eyes maybe?

Alternately there's an LDoN BP that's comparable to these that seems to
drop a LOT.

This will do for now, but take a look at the Loyalist Shield of Honor quest.

Not too many choices here.  Eventually you'll want ornate for the IH4, but
that's for later on.  I wouldn't bother looking for an upgrade immediately.

Obulous Death Shroud if you don't get a Crystalline Torque.  Blessed

Whatever BD cultural bracer is appropriate.  The saves on those are nice,
combined with good ac and some wis/hp/mana.

*SHRUG* - no real good ideas here - I still use a BD cultural

If your guild does a lot of BoT groups, have them save you up drops of
pure rain and get your friendly local smith to make you Hurricane Plate
Gauntlets.

Shadel Bandit Ring.  Maybe the wis/ac/hp/mana ring from the revamped CoM
(should be relatively cheap).

Your long-term goal should be ornate boots, but you probably won't see them
soon.

Tae Ew, eventually upgrade to Tacticians Bulwark if your guild does Tactics
regularly (my guild is having trouble finding any more alts to give Bulwarks
to).
