Hehehe, a ranger in our guild reached level 20 the other night... We're an 
evil guild (theoretically), the IGF stands for Innoruuk Guardian Force, so 
he wanted a surname that showed that even if he was an icky goody-goody 
ranger, he still had his evil side.

He shall now forever be known as:  Annuvin Smackrabbit
