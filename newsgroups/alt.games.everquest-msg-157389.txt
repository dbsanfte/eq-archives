There were two level 62's on my server (Veeshan) yesterday where there were
none in the days leading up to PoP. There were also about 35 level 61's. No
63, 64, or 65.

I would say..... make a lvl 1 char and check it out. / all 62 is the command
you need.....

And yes I agree: If people make it to level 62 in ONE day they obviously
play half the day and have nothing better to do with their lives. I had
expected the first 62 to hit before the end of the week..... but in one
day???

I'm too busy to play today I think but I might get on tonight to see if
there is a 63 already :))
