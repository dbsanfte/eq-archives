The reward calcs shouldn't be a big deal.

I do recognize the mass of character saves x 300 characters to be an
issue though. 

They might quarter the traffic by handing 4 tokens at a time. (don't
know ... they might already). 

Other than that, I *want* char saves with each turn in... the last
thing we need is another dupe exploit.

I wonder whether that will peter out as some of the excess cash is
sucked out of the game... it might be viable to rotate the casinos on
the servers until the interest in them dies down a bit.
