If you develop a minimal amount of tailoring skill you can make
yourself much better containers than the BP.  The BP has 10 large
slots with 10% weight reduction and weighs 3.0.  A tailored large
bag has 6 large slots with 10% wt. reduction and weighs 0.8.  A
tailored belt pouch has 6 medium slots with 10% wt. reduction and
weighs 0.6.  Or, if you have a friend who is a skilled tailor, you
can gather the necessary materials and have him/her make you your
containers and sell the extra materials for way too much plat in
the bazaar. The raw materials are 6 spiderling silks and a LQ Bear
Skin for the bag, 6 spiderling silks and a LQ Cat Pelt for the
pouch.  There are 5 total combines required, but 3 are no fail and
the others trivial at or near 36 skill.
