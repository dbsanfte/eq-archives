As far as I know this could have been a glitch in the engine. Before I start
claiming this is also dropped by skeletons and mail it to sites such as
Allakhazam I would like to have 2 or 3 other witnesses who have seen these
items drop on them. Just to make sure I'm not making a fool of myself.

I myself will hunt down some more skels for an hour or two and then maybe
head to CT if the drops aren't going fast enough :)
