Stuff cut

Wow that post is one big giant smoking of the crack pipe.

It was also set to have all responses go to a net abuse email group.
Is this another one of those things just to cause spam in one group?
If it is what exactly is the purpose of that? 
I mean, its the 2000's (or whatever you'd call these years.. ) and
spamming usenet groups hardly accomplishes jack or inconveniences
anyone in this day and age. People act like its 1987 and we are all on
2400 baud modems.
Trance formation goofs have too much time on their hands I guess.

Ah, just checked on their site and its not even them:

"NOTICE: Newsgroups, usenet users, an other victims of spam abuse.
Recently someone has sent spam out in the name of the owners of this
website. The owners sympathize with your being victimized and would
never be the source of any such scheme, themselves being victims of
even more heinous acts than spam. The source of the spam did not
orignate from this website or this server. We're sorry for any
inconvenience you have suffered, but this crime was not perpetrated
here."

So heads up if replying to original post, its redirected to that other
group to cause spam.
