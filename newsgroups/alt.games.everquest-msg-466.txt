You took too long. Items only stay for about 3-5 minutes. Move
both characters to the same spot so you can switch fast.

One method I use is to find an out of the way brew barrel, oven
or kiln and put stuff in that and log in the character. A couple of advantages
to this: 1. the items 'seem' to stay until the server goes down. I left
a bunch stuff in a brew barrel overnight once to see. 2. People will
always investigate a bag laying on the ground but don't normally
check every tradeskill appliance in a town. One downside is that
you can't Twink money or containers this way.

One thing for sure is NEVER twink anything solo like this if its
something you absolutely don't want to lose. If you go linkdead
and can't get back on or the server goes down you are screwed.
