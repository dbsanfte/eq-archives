Or, even better, make it so that a "combine" only consumes one item out of a
stack. Put 20 sheets, 20 water, 20 leather & a bracer mold in the forge and
you end up with 19 sheets, 19 water, 19 leather left in the forge & maybe a
bracer. Since there are no recepies that need more than one item in a slot
anyhow, this shouldn't be too difficult to do (though they might have to do
a little work to allow a container to be something other than empty after a
combine).

I've no objection to VI making craft skills hard to improve by limiting
materials, etc. But making them hard to improve by making the UI difficult
(if not literally painful) is an amazingly bad idea.
