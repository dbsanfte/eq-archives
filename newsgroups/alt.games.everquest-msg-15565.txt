    Isn't that the function of a newsgroup? ;-)

    Let me tell you why *I* would jump to another server in a heartbeat.
When I started, it was because I'd heard so much about EQ from a RL friend.
So I started a TSK on his server. He was several levels above me, so we
couldn't do anything together. Being a TSK is quite lonely at low levels, as
Innothule and SRo are ghost towns. A few weeks after starting, a friend came
over to see the game. To show him how to make a character, I picked a random
server with a goofy name (Quellious) and made a dwarf cleric, something I'd
played a lot of in AD&D. I started playing her as well as my TSK for when
soloing orc camps in SRo got too tedious for words (remember, 40% XP penalty
and no blue line).

    Delores, the cleric, got into a guild first. And it was a guild based on
friendship and light roleplaying (all-Dwarf). Guess who I started playing
more - the cleric. I built up my characters on Quellious, and the last time
I logged on the TSK was to transfer her to Zeb with my buddy so we could
still chat.

    Fast forward to the Velious endgame. My server is almost entirely
pro-Giant, as being Giant is perceived as being the path to the phattest
lewts. What few guilds aren't pro-Giant are small, and don't raid on an
active schedule. Thing is, I still have that small spark of roleplaying left
in me. I won't kill Coldain, period. And the guilds that are pro-Giant not
only kill "snorfs" on a regular basis, but expect you to join them on their
faction.

    What path do you suppose my buddy on Zeb and his guild are on? Yep,
anti-Giant. Raiding with him would be a dream - he's smart about EQ, and has
a personality I could really enjoy being grouped with regularly. They also
raid actively, yet seem to leave plenty of time for individual adventuring.
As for friends on Quellious, well, my two closest in-game friends BOTH just
quit EQ in the past week. I still have a few friends on the server, and I
could see leaving a few low-level characters behind to play with them (or
asking them to switch with me - RL married couple, no real ties to
Quellious). But Delores would move to Zeb, for sure. Unless I was stripped
of items - even though my buddy is flush (300+K at last count - he's part of
a small consortium), I wouldn't want to have to beg stuff off him to join
him.
