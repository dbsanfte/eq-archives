Do you just jump into a thread at the end or do you read them?

Not 2 posts ago I posted a link to a thread on the CoH forums that asked 
what killstealing was. The consensus there was consistent with my 
definition. Lets be clear this is a consensus of CoH players on CoH 
forums.

Further I read through several CoH forums, searching for kill steal, and 
the result was consistently within the scope of the definitions of kill 
stealing that I've been proposing. Head over to the CoH forums and see 
for yourself. Most references to KillStealing are -not- cases of, and I 
quote: 

"a player who CAN RECEIVE NO EXPERIENCE for the mob he kills that was 
being fought by another player."

In fact, none of the mentions of killstealing that I found on the CoH 
forums would fit this definition. But I concede I didn't read -all- of 
them. I'm sure you could find some if you looked hard enough.

No.

I said "No". 

I have never said it was a major problem, nor have I said that the devs 
needed to code fixes for it. I merely said CS should be acknowledging 
it.
