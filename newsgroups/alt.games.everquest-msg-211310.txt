You can get your faction up with paineel then kill the weak skelly guards
for about 7 plat each.  They fixed it so you lose faction with every kill
but you can go raise it up again in warrens.  Not actually sure if you can
melee them cause my cleric was just root blasting when he was there.  But I
think you can.

You could approch a group and ask if you could practice 1hb.  Most wont mind
as long as you arent ks'ing which theres not much chance of.  What I did
though was notice when our guild was raiding AC I wasnt pushed to heal so
much so I just memmed yaulp and 2 low level stuns and stood up and helped
melee.  Dont forget to practice bash too.  You do need to be careful to not
lose track of everyones health.  Helps if you have a backup healer just in
case.  Also watch out you dont take aggro from the MT.  It can happen if you
stun too much.  And remember to use /assist.
