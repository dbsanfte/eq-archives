The entrance to the Plane of Time has been bugged/broken/messed
up/overlooked by those trying to
get in there *delete as appropriate*

The Mithanial Marr guild Afterlife had a serverwide first in getting in
there.
Sony's official stance is that the reason it took so long is that they
didn't speak to a particular
NPC in order to gain access. AFAIK there are still problems there, limiting
the number of
guild members entrance - I think it's about 18 people atm. Current reports
seem to indicate
POTA to be a sort of zone similar to Plane of Tranquility - in other words a
zone where you
gain access to other zones.
I can't see this particular zone as being a quest laden zone - moreover an
explanation perhaps
of many of Everquests puzzles, and perhaps an indication of what to expect
in EQ2 ?

Who know's. As a lore freak, I'm dying to know. Will Kerafyrm make an
appearance ?
Veeshan perhaps ? Will there even be an end mob ? Perhaps it will be a 40ft
Moss Snake.
Now THAT would be sweet.
