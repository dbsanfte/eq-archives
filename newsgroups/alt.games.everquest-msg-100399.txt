Baldur's Gate is on 5 CDs and takes up about 2.2 GB if copied fully to the
hard drive (save time loading...and no swapping disks).  To make that easier
on people who don't want to put 2.2 GB of data on their hard drive, they
released a DVD-ROM version.  Exact same game, but all disks are copied to a
single DVD-ROM disk.  So you only have to load one disk and its all there.

Now that EQ has so many CDs, they should consider the same.

I also believe the old gave Riven (another 5 CD) was eventually released on
DVD-ROM (again, same game, just convenience of all disks copied onto a
single one).
