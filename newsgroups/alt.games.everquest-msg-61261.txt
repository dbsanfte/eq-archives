hey jazz,

I might be able to add some input here as I went through the same thing on
Saturday.   I use Gateways as you do (factory here in town so I buy cheap
remans.) so what I say should work.

There are a few ways to see what your currents system specs are.

1. Press and hold tab or F1 (it will say as its booting) as your system
boots to take you into machine setup.  You can scroll though the information
and see what you want and leave without changing anything.

2. go to start menu > programs > accessories > system tools  and there
should be a system information utility

3. find the GWic? (or similar) directory in your harddrive, this is a
gateway subdirectory and it has a system information txt file that list your
hardware.

4. go to www.gateway.com and under tech support > there is a utility that
will scan your computer and return the current hardware.

I am running win98se and I have an 700mhz athalon Gateway, about 18 months
old, and it had the original 128meg ram and a Nvidia TNT2 pro graphics card.
I bought (2) 256meg dimm modules and added them to the 128meg already
installed for a total of 640meg.   DIDN'T WORK! machine locked up a few
seconds or minutes after getting into norrath.   I suspect the machine is
limited to 512meg OR didn't like the 2 dissimilar sizes/brands/speeds of
DIMM modules. - solution was to remove the original 128meg and settle for
512meg total.  Worked all day Saturday so must be ok.

Next I got a good deal on a new video card - GEFORCE3 from bestbuy for
$89.00 ($150.00 thanksgiving special - $50.00 rebate - $10.00 returned
unopened package discount). Popped it in and ran the install disk, easy!
Ran EQ all day and it worked FAIRLY well.  I had it lock up twice while
zoning which is new for me.   The screen became a half size black box with
my windows desktop underneath and froze.  I could see a portion of an error
box say something like "illegal command".   twice in 100 zones or so over
the weekend.   ANY IDEAS? ANYONE?
