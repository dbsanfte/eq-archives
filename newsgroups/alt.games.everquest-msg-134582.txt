Hey, don't complain, my druid is half green now and the sleeves that
replaced the clashing nathsar are an upgrade... and not all my girls
match. My warrior now has 4 or 5 different shades of plate, my cleric
is a hodgepodge who for some reason looks ok with black plate bp and
nathsar sleeves, and the main reason I got darkforge sleeves is that
chain sleeve and plate bp on a dark elf look horrendous together, and
the df sleeves were easily obtainable and comparable to rygorr so it
was a no-brainer to go with the option that matched - it is quite
possible to choose gear for both looks and stats.

(Let's not go into why I have worn black chitin leggings since they
put in proper skin tinting, mmkay? :p )
