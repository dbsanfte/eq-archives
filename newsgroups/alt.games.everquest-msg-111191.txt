Actually, it's not that tough to get from Gfay to Everfrost now, it just
takes a while.  It's not dangerous for a level 9 anymore.

Take the Gfay spires to Luclin, then the Odus portal down to Toxxulia forest.
That's a level 1-10 zone and a level 9 shouldn't have much trouble
running through it, especially if he has any sort of invis.  Zone into Erudin
and then take the boat to Qeynos, then from there to Everfrost is just a couple of
easy zonings.  The only slighty tricky bit is getting through Blackburrow.
(actually a great zone for a level 9 in a group!), and it's not really a problem so
long as you avoid the rather large, obvious hole in the ground, and avoid the
ever present trains coming up from the dungeon.  The path through is short.

Having an escort to help you through would be an excellent idea.
