I generally deal with hasting as needed, during fights, while pulls are 
happenning, just whenever it wears off of my pup, I start casting, barring 
immediate need for heals or a slow.  I prefer having an enchanter, as that 
covers both hasting and CC.

I love having an SK in my group, as the MA preferably.  I know that I can 
cast slow on the mob as it's coming in, and it won't hit me.  Paladins are 
good too.  With a warrior MA, I have to either expect to get smacked a 
couple times, or wait to slow.
