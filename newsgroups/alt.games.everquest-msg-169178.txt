    Ok, here's a neat test you can run with him. Ask him to strip all buffs,
and tell you what his HPs are. According to that Magelo, he should be in the
low 3100's (food+drink bonus, I have 1 STA less than him from my
food+drink). Now ask him to tell you what his HPs are after each buff he
gets. His HP buffs are going to be Virtue (same as me), Focus-line (same as
me), Brell's/SV (same as me), Boar/Brute (he'll get more HPs than me from
this because I'm STA-capped and I bet he isn't). Even if I got absolutely no
HPs from Boar (which is not the case), he'd get 60x3.3=198 HPs closer to me.
And he's over 300 HPs behind according to Magelo.

    The only other thing I can think of is he's doing the multi-buff thing
and going with Symbol, druid HP/mana regen buff, Focus-line, Brell's/SV,
Boar/Brute. If that's how he's making up the 100 HP difference, then be sure
to bump me up to mid 5800's for HPs. I don't waste an entire buff slot for
100 HPs. ;-)
