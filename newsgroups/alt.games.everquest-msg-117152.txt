My level 29 druid was selling large 10% weight reduction 10 slot handmade
backpacks the other night in EC.  80 PP each.  Some strange guy sends me a
tell.  Wants 3.  (Way cool).  I offer him a discount on quantity.  He says
something about putting them in the bank.  I'm thinking: Oh great, I can't sell
a newb something he really doesn't need.
So I explain to him that although these are great bags he can get boxes in the
Bazarr for 2 PP or giant tool kits from some vendors.  
He says "huh?"
I explain that there are much cheaper bags you can buy if you are just going to
use them for "bank" storage.  
Next thing I know he's standing right in front of me - wearing this incredibly
cool robe. Buys all 4 I have for sale for 100 PP each and gives me something
called "Kodaks Endless Intellect", (I had never gotten Clarity 3 before...
someone had to explain it to me :) and a bunch of other GREAT buffs...
I am now a level 31 druid :)
(Just goes to show The "oldies" are still helping us "newbies" :)
