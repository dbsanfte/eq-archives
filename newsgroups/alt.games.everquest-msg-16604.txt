If it will fit.. yes (see below what I would do)

Transfer your mp3's to your big hard drive, and use the 6 gigger as the
primary drive (assuming it is the same speed as the 20gigger)  Then I would
cleanup the 20gig drive, by deleting whatever is not needed.

or
(my recommendation)
Cram as much as you can on the little 6gigger.  Then fdisk the 20gigger,
partition it 5gigs (primary) and 15gigs, install all your programs on the 15
and just use the 5 as a windows install.

That's how I did it about a year ago, and just recently had to format.
Luckly i didn't lose much because everything is on the bigger partion that
does not host the OS (windows).

This is kind of upper level stuff, so do your research or find a friend with
a cd burner and start burning stuff.

May also want to ask what the important config files are for eq, so you do
not lose your friend lists, macros and such.

Hope this helps you,
Brandon
