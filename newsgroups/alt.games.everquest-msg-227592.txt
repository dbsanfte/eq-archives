Monk?

On a side note, you might want to try channeling all tells into one window,
guild chat into another, chat line chat into a third, etc.  Minimize them
until you have downtime, then catch up.  Some friends of mine throw up AFK
tags when they're hunting if too many people send them tells, with an AFK
message saying, "Dangerous hunting, catch me later :)".

I know the pain, though; it's why I like groups that don't sit in one spot.
If we sit in one spot, I *am* going to get distracted.  LDON has spoiled me.
:D
