> Design2:  Ahhhhhh!!
> Intern1:  Um sir?
> Brad:  Yes, what is it?
> Intern1:  I have this nice new zone for Luclin setup here on my PC to show

> Brad:  <Brad looks> Hmm...not enough trees and terrain near the zone line.

> Intern1:  Yes but sir trees don't grow on a moo...
> <Brad pulls a lever>
> Intern1:  Ahhhhh!!
> Intern2:  Umm Brad?
> Brad: Yes, what now?
> Intern2:  I have this super idea for some new Luclin content involving

> Smed:  Sounds interesting, go on.
> Intern2:  Well, for it to work we'd need to make some changes...
> Brad: What changes?
> Intern2:  Well, we'd need to have an NPC setup there to bind melee types.
> Smed:  Hmm...
> Brad:  Can we do that?
> Intern2:  Yes...erm...but it would mean we are flip-flopping on that issue.
> That could hurt us.
> <meeting room pauses, then everyone bursts into laughter>
> Brad:  <wiping a tear> Oh man that was good...hehe.
> <Brad pulls a lever>
> Intern2:  No wait, Ahhhhhh!!
> Design2:  NooB
> Smed:  OK, no more messing around.  This thing ships in a few months and we

> Design1:  Hmm, how about we make a few buggy zones, add a few broken quests,

> so we can meet our deadline?
> Brad:  I like that.
> Smed:  <jots down some notes> Me too.
> Design1:  I have a suggestion.
> Brad: Go ahead.
> Design1:  Well, it occurs to me that Scars of Luclin makes for a somewhat
> humorous acronym.  Perhaps we should change that?
> Smed:  I'm not following...
> Brad:  You mean the SoL thing?
> Design1:  Yes, I mean, people already know it's Luclin because of all the
> NPCs we're adding.  We could rename it to...Planet of Scars?
> Brad:  Planet of Scars...I like that.  Will people misinterpret PoS as
> anything humorous?
> Smed:  I doubt it.  Let's go with that.
> Brad:  OK, I've heard some good stuff here.  Let's work with this now.
> Design2:  One last thing please?
> Smed:  What's up?
> Design2:  The Gems program is quite popular and we should expand on that.
> Brad:  Gems is important stuff.  Move some of the people who correct bugs
> into your group if you have to...I'm getting tons of emails about that.
> Design2:  Will do.
> Brad:  Meeting adjourned.
