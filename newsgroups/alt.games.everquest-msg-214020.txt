If the choice was between a 2 hour snare and a 1.5 minute snare, which
would you choose?  No one said that people usually need 14 minutes. 
What they said is that you usually need more than darkness spells will
give you.

In our last discussion I ended up mildly insulting you, calling you
clueless IIRC.  But I didn't come to that point because I was angry at
losing an argument.  I came to that point because I grew frustrated
with the way you discussed the issues.  You have a way of making
points that everyone else in the game disagrees with, and then
defending them tooth-and-nail, implying that other people are
ignorant, changing the subject when it suits you, purposefully missing
the point, and using other annoying debating games.  People get
frustrated with you when you do this.

Note that, at least according to the quoted text, he really didn't
insult you.  He certainly didn't call you any name.  He insulted your
point, quite effectively, and you took it as an insult.

No it assumes that people would prefer to be able to cast snare on a
mezzed mob.  This is just one more case of you seemingly purposefully
misunderstanding the point.  No one said would say "I dislike the fact
that when I cast darkness on a mezzed mob, either I or the enchanter
die".  Rather they would say, "I dislike the fact that I am unable to
cast darkness on a mezzed mob unless I want to break mez."

The fact that I have to baby-talk you through this obvious point is
very frustrating.  It leads people to dislike your style of
discussion.  It leads them to either believe that you are truly
ignorant and simply cannot grasp the point that was made to you, or
that you are insulting their intelligence by purposefully
misunderstanding their point.  Note that some people have accused you
of the later, assuming you are not ignorant.  That means they are
giving you the benefit of the doubt when it comes to your knowledge.

> I mean really, just tell the necro not to cast on mezzed mobs and
> use /assist. Kind of a waste of my time trying to educate you with details.

The only alternative reason (alternative to you just purposefully
misunderstanding) that you might post what you just posted is that you
don't understand *why* someone would want to snare a mezzed mob.  Do
you know why someone would want to snare a mezzed mob?

I guess it never happens in game that people might want to snare a
mezzed mob.  Is that it?  Which is it, Cortese?  You are too ignorant
of this game to understand *why* someone would snare a mezzed mob, and
do it ALL THE TIME?  Or are you purposefully miunderstanding the
point?

  It destroys the illusion you know play the game
