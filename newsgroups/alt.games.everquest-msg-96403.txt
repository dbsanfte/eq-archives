Part of the myth of Hell Levels was the fact that at those levels, there
were
no places for mass amounts of players to hunt. If you are lvl 44 going for
45
and you have only 2 mobs on each continent to hunt (or 2 spots to camp) and
you have to share them with 25 other 44's, it's going to take you a long
time to
level. With the additions of all the new zones such as Stonebrunt and the
Luclin
zones, there are more places than ever for hell levels to hunt. It doesn't
make the
experience points raise faster per kill, but at least you don't have to take
turns.
