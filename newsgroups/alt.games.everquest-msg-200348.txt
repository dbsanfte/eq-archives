Well, you'll still need to be lvl 62 to get into BoT  for one thing,
and honestly, a group of lvl 62s probably won't be taking out any of
the named in BoT. Even with Tash and Malo, I couldn't slow a BoT named
at 62 while a 65 enchanter could with a few resists. Plus, the place
is gonna be a madhouse for a few weeks after lvl limits are removed. 

As for CT, 4c still has some nice drops even if you don't head up the
pyramid, plus it's never camped any more. Check out the base and if
your enchanter doesn't have any problems mezzing the brown lizards
(green ones are lower lvl)  there you should be ok for a trip up the
pyramid. Expect to see nothing but the brown variety once you start
heading up though, I think those are around 60th lvl.

I don't know that specific mob but I highly doubt it.
