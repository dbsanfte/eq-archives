Now I know that Jewelcraft is an expensive endevor...  Because I have been
attempting to raise my skill in this craft.

However...  Is there an easier way (more efficient) to raise skill?

I have only been able to raise my skill to the low 30's and am finding that
it is too expensive for me to advance any further in any reasonable amount
of time.  I am only level 14 and find it hard to come by enough money to buy
even one stack of silver yet alone jasper, gold or ~dreaming~ platinum...
And then getting it enchanted is a whole other story.  I've been lucky
enough to find some generous enchanters who have been willing to enchant a
few bars here and there for no charge...  But most want 2-10pp per bar...
Which is plain highway robery.

I am not trying to profit from this craft so much as to be able to make
great jewelery for myself and my party.

Is there a better way to make the craft worthwile.

Any advice?
