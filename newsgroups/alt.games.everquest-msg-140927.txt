Well it is a bit more complex that that to fully explain

Isnt there a +5 in there to clean up the early levels a bit

xp = xp * ((yourlevel+5)/(sum of grouplevels + (5*number in group)))

I *think*

Note however that level 34 needs about 40% more xp to level than the 30
And the 36 needs more than that.

So while the level 30 is getting less raw xp they are leveling the
fastest.
The level 36 getting the most raw xp is leveling the slowest.
(Note ignoring race differences)

If grouped for long enough these 3 chars will end up the same level.
The one who was 36 at the start will be furthest through the level, and
considering the differences it probably wont happen till they all ding
45.
