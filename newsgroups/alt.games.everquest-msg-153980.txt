Most definately.  As a rogue in a small raid (>12 people for an epic mob in
the Hole or something like that...quick in-and-out), it's fallen to me to
off
tank an add for a little bit.  I can do it, but a ranger is MUCH more
effective
at it because of one simple thing...that Taunt button.

My taunt button sometimes hits for minimum damage...and it's not
unknown for me to screw up and Evade when I get aggro, simply from
force of habit.
