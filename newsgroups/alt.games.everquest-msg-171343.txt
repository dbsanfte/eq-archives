>Does any one have any idea??. I have never bin to the Bazar before.

Once you get in the bazaar you may experience terrible lag.  Move north down by
the stables if you do and look down at the floor.  This helps a LOT.
Then type /bazaar.  A screen will pop up where you can make choices of what to
look for.  You can pick druid, wood elf, (or whatever you are), the slot you
want to fill, etc.  The last item is dollar range - you can put in 1 to 50 plat
or whatever you can afford.  Then hit "find".  You can click on the items you
are interested in to get a description.  Once you decide what you want click on
the person's name (over on the right).  You will automatically face the
direction that that person is in.  I always move this screen down and to the
left so I can see the general direction I am moving in.  Then when you find the
person click on them, the stuff they have for sale will pop up.  Be careful to
pick the right item.
Keep in mind that people can price things any way they choose.  The same mace
may be priced by one vendor at 20 plat and another guy will have it for 100
plat.  I often write down the items I'm interested in and check pricing for a
few days before making the purchase, just to see if another vendor will show up
at a lower price.
