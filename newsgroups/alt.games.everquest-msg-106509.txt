Now that my main is into his 50's (almost through 51) I know first hand what
people mean when they say that they think their experience bar is broken.
What would people think of getting Verant to change the experience bar to
show a third line, which would be fractions of a blue bubble.  I don't think
it would be a huge coding change...just move the blue bar up a few pixels,
and draw a green/red/yellow/whatever beneath it representing the fraction of
a blue the player is currently on.  At least for the post 50 players it
*might* move a bit each kill and give some indication of progress...

Is it worth asking to have this done?
