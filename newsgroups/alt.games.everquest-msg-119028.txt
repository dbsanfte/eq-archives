The range of attitudes Druid's see is amazing (I supppose the Cleric's see 
even more than we do) Last night about covered it.   

First the bad

I have been barely playing EQ for the past 8 months but I was bored last 
night and decided to log on with my level 50 druid on Drinal (I'm trying to 
set a record for time spent at 50, LOL).  An old friend told me that Oasis 
was now "crawling with the undead" so I decided to go take a quick look.  
I'm anonymous and my spells were still set up for soloing from the last 
time I had been on.   

I get to the back of oasis and a monk comes running up to me yelling for 
help and feigns death right at my feet.  Ok, maybe he saw the Dark ember I 
was carrying and assumed I could take whatever was chasing.  Look around, 
nothing is coming.   BOOM  a burst of fire hits the monk   OK, a dry bones 
or madman   All I see are crocs.  Where is he?   A madman steps around one 
of the trees.  I hit him with Starfire.    Dead madman.   So I wait a 
second expecting the monk to pop up.   He yells for help   Wasn't expecting 
that!!  Target the monk.  The only healing spell I have up is chloro.  
Start casting chloro but the monk dies before the spell casts.

So I feel bad about being a little slow and not being able to save the guy 
and do a little medding to get back my mana back up with the intention of 
buffing him when he gets back.  A tell comes in, but not from the monk, 
it's from some level 55 warrior in Velious

Warrior "why didn't you heal him?"

Me "I didn't realize that he was that close to death till he yelled"

Warrior  "A guy is on the ground and you think he's ok?"

Me  " In case you hadn't noticed he's a monk and was obviously feigning 
death.  By the time he yelled and I targeted him and started to cast chloro 
on him he was dead"

Warrior "How convienent"

Me (starting to get annoyed) "Exactly what do you mean by convienent?"

Warrior "Never mind"

No thanks for trying, just annoyance that I didn't whirl around and cast 
heal at the monk while in mid-air.

This is one of the reasons my playing has slacked way off

Now the good

So I gate back to FV (I'm bound by the bank) and prepare to camp.

Level 39 Warrior " Will somebody please gate me to NK for a CR"

I check,  I'm the only gater in FV.

"Sigh"

By the time I send him a tell that I'll take him he's offering 50 plat for 
the gate.

Ok I can use the cash 

Group with the guy and he want's to make a trade

100 plat

Me cancel trade "guy that's too much  50 is more than enough"

Him "Dude I am so happy to not have to hunt down someone in my guild to 
come and get me that I want you to take it"

Me  " 50 is plenty"

Him " come on take it"

Me  "you sure?"

Him "yes"

So I SoW him, give him SLN, and gate him to NK

Him "Thanks"

Me  "and thank you"

There are people who are nice even to druids
