Oh, forgot one point (believe it or not, in all that rambling).

We can only mem up 8 spells.  At level 18 that's not a problem yet, but
it'll start being annoying in another few levels.  You gotta forgo certain
defenses...you gotta make choices.  Indoors I rarely bother with root
because I have too many other things to keep up.

Unless I'm hunting in a zone where nothing can be stunned or mezzed (Kael) I
always have 2 stuns and mez up.  If I'm not hunting with a shaman, slow is
always memmed.  That's 4 spells icons used all the time.  If critters are
low MR I don't bother with tash but usually it's up, so that's 5.  Only
leaves 3 slots for misc. stuff, and I am ALWAYS accessing the first 12 pages
(well, 6 if you want to count it that way) of my spell book.   So root often
takes a back seat.

Clarity2 is almost always memmed because it always seems to drop during the
toughest fights where if I don't cast it during the fight ('cause at 55 you
can rarely sit down & mem something 'cause the critters LOVE to hit sitting
enchanters) we may be in big trouble.

Ah, rambling again, sorry. :)
At level 55
