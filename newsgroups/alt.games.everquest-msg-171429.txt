First of all, boost your HP's as a necro.  You will be more mana efficient
converting your HPs than you will trying to up INT and mana.  Do the quest
for the Fine Antique Ring in PoK, that will add HP and Mana (you should be
able to purchase ring for about 250 or so, these days as the quest is so
easy).  I'd try to get one of the +55hp/+5ac rings at half te +65/+6 prices
as the other ring.

What is your current INT and where are the plus INT items?  Can't give good
advice without that.
