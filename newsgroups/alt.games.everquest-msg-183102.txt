I use Netscape Communicator for reading & replying to newsgroups, I much
prefer it over OE or even Outlook, I prefer it to Xnews for this as
well.  Xnews is the best if you want to deal with binaries though.

I just wish I could find a way to get Netscape to keep the newsgroup
stuff instead of deleteing old posts.  Although if I really want to find
something old I can usually go look in google (yuck, worse than OE for
reading & replying).
