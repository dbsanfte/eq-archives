They also appear to have tried bombing and bulldozers, which are
still much along the same line as the tanks.

Or even sending police rather than soldiers after suspects.

Also consider that a Palestinian who has seen a friend, neighbour or
family member killed or nearly been killed themselves. Cannot simply
report the matter to the police and have them persue the killer. With
the chances of any Palestinian being able to identify who did the
killing being effectivly nil. All they know is that it was an Israeli,
in an American, British, German, etc tank or warplane.
