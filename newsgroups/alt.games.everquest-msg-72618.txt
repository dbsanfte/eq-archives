If we can go to cover no longer dropped and possibly prenerf, then it is
Bladestorm, Katana of Steel Sleet.
Proc is an AoE in excess of 900dam (in 3 waves, similar to skyfire) The
weapon no longer drops in game and I had read it was well and truly battered
with the nerf stick (proc was reduced to around 300odd damage, still AoE)
Not sure if it was nerfed so all others dropped were lesser in damage or
whether they nerfed all of them either way, after the nerf the pulled the
weapon, prolly due to the AoE being a liability.
Checked on Allakhazam's and someone there says he still has one and it still
procs for the full damager (he also recons it is DD and I am certain it
isn't)

CF
I know of no one with this weapon, does anyone?
