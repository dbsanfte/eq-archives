As you increase in levels, and especially after level 51, you will probably
become a lot more judgemental about what experience is good and what is not
so good.  Some monsters are just easier to kill than most others their same
level.  To that, add the fact that some zones offer more exp per kill of a
given level monster than others do.  Then "good experience" would be finding
the easiest to kill monsters (not always the same ones from one class to
another if you're soloing) in the zones with the best exp modifier.  Even
this is a bit simplistic, becuase it does you little good if you can kill a
monster in seconds and get a huge bonus for the zone, but if those monsters
are not easy to find in that zone.  But maybe this gives you a bit of an
idea.
