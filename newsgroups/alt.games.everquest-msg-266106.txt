I've never really understood this MMO-industry concept of a "free first 
month" when you just paid $40, $50 or more to buy the game.

If you paid nothing to get the client, and then didn't have to pay anything 
for the first 30 days, THAT would be a free first month.  A case in point 
being the recent Everquest Trilogy offering with a free download of EQ and 
it's first two expansions and 30 days free trial before deciding if you wish 
to continue playing with the monthly fee.

Otherwise, it's technically an issue of the first month included in the 
purchase price of the product.  By the definition of the word, that is not 
"free".

It's a matter of semantics, I guess.
