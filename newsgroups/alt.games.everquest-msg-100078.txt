Well.. the Luclin addon is a must if you have a decent "uber" pc with enough
oompf to run the new textures.. It looks ALOT better.. But it is not a
"musthave" unless you want to create a character based on this pack..

The Kunark, and Velious addons are new worlds.. Kunark have the Iksar, so if
you wanna be an iksar you will need the Kunark addon. the Velious addon is a
new continent..

So the basic conclusion will be like this :

If you are happy running around Odus, Antonica and Faydwer.. you dont "need"
it.. But if you are to become more than lvl 50 you will need the greater xp
these continents give.. (Velious have a lot of High lvl areas, and Luclin
have probably the most..) I also think the Luclin update is what gives you
the possibility to gain AA (Alternate Advancement) ability to build your
charater past lvl 60 (not 61, but 60 + abilities)
