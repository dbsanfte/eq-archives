True -  in a professional sense. I remember the pains we went through doing
the Y2K updates and how badly some wrote it. What I meant was personal code
for yourself that you release for kicks and give away as an afterthought.
For example, I have an obscure piece of hardware for a Linux system and
write myself some drivers and software for my own kicks. It's really a
hurryup job and pretty sloppy. I find out there are a *few* others still
using that hardware and release it to those others. I've of the opinion
that those people who benefited from my own personal work shouldn't bitch. 

However, I *do* agree that a professionally written piece of software
should be just that - professional.
