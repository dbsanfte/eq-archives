I'm still pretty new to EQ (and MMORPGs in general) and I play on Starpyre
as well. I went to that server because it was new, so I figured that's where
I should start. Several of the people I've played with are new to the game
as well. I've also come across plenty of people who've been playing for a
while, some of whom have helped out with advice. I haven't noticed that many
people begging for handouts since I left my newbie area. Part of that could
be that I send OOC chatter to a seperate chat window and ignore it for the
most part.There are always a few rotten eggs in the bunch I guess and those
are the ones that tend to get noticed.

I'm closing in on level 20 (finally) with no begging, no twinking, and no
PLing. The only gear I have that was given to me are a couple of items that
group members looted but asked if I could use (both my recondite bracers).
