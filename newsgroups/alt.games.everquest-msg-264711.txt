When this happened in original EQ's release, Fennin Ro was designated
the unofficial "roleplaying preferred server". It became the server
with the worst reputation for gimps and dewdish behavior, probably
because its designation got it an early population lead, making
everyone joining the game think it was the 'best' server (since thats
where the most people were, if you follow their reasoning).

Without certain ruleset changes a la Firiona Vie I don't see how any
server can manage to be any different from any other in a positive
sense in the long run.

Dollars to donuts there is no significant difference between any
server. There isn't among the regular EQLive servers anymore.
