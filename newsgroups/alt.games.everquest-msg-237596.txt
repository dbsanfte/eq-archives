WOk been reading for a while haven't noticed this addressed anywhere.  When
I play Eq for a long while (usually 6-7 hours) the sound is fine.  Until I
hit the 6-7th hour.  SUddenly the noise will become "broken", best way to
explain this is almost like an echo of the sound.  Take picking up plat for
instance, supposed to here say "ching".  Instead I get something like this
"Ching, ching, ching, ching"  getting progessively quieter.  If I do a /camp
desktop, and then restart the game the noise problem has corrected.

I am running
Asus A7n8X
Athlon XP 2500+
Geforce 4 Mx440 8X
512 Mb Dual Channel Pc2700 Ram
Using on board sound.
I have updated to the latest drivers on all, latest Bios on all, Latest
version of DirectX etc...  not sure what causes this.

TIA
