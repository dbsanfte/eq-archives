Ok, I did have the "Allow Context Menus" turned off.  That fixed the
right-click for spell meming.

Thank you.  I probably turned that off, not knowing what it did.  My
ignorance.

However, I still cannot see the 3d Target ring, and that option is turned
on.  (And always has been, It just quit working)

So, part of the puzzle is solved.  Any other ideas about the 3d target ring?
