Ah, but you see, i dont drink, unless you count cooking with alcohol 
[and i dont think i have ever gotten the slightest buzz of my coq au 
vin...]and a sip of a toast [hm, last one was a year ago November 20th, 
a wedding...] and i am NOT going to knuckle under when it is not the truth.

Yup, If i were an early christian, i would be the toasty end of a 
torture session because i *don't* go against honesty. i am not an 
alcoholic, and I will not claim to be one to make some people happy and 
leave me alone. Burn incense to the gods? Nope...

Not that AA [and its variants, weight, sex, drugs, kids of 
alcoholics...] don't do good, but it des require that the person 
involved recognize their probem and want to deal with it...as a 
nondrinker, AA is about as useful to me as te@ts on my cat. At least on 
my sheep i could make cheese...
