Yes he was, on both scores I'd say!

Yes,

Ok... I can't resist... sorry.  I've played, in order... Wiz to 16, Necro to
24. Pally to 16, Claric to 24,  Mage to 37 and Shammy to currently 3 1/2
yellows into 56 without the aid of any PL'n.  KEI only showed up on the
sceen when my Shammy was in his mid 40's in DL and I resisted using it for
several levels so I've taken the Longggggggggg route and then some
eventhough I got my Shammy to 54 in only a little over 7 days of playing
time (over 168 hrs)!

When Shammy was 55 I opened a second account on another box and used my
Shammy to PL a Wiz to 53 in 33 days (just over 4 days playing time) so I
could have my own personal taxi service...LOL   Just 14 days ago I made a
Barbarian Rogue on second accound (wife also has an account) and have been
able to PL him to 47 as of today.  He will be used to tank for my Shammy,
wifes 56 Druid and work friends 59 Claric so we don't have to play the
idiotic waiting for a group game...  [and please don't tell me Rogues can't
tank like my wifes guildies told her!  My Barbarian Rogues stats at 47 (ZERO
deaths to date too) with Shammy buffs are; 2104HP's, 949AC(around low 960's
with Claric buffs I think) and 989 ATK!  After I add the last 2 upgrades of
gear (new sword and helm) and he hits 50 and goes off to PoP his HP's will
be around 2300's (3200ish with Claric buffs), AC at about 972/973 (about
985ish with Claric buffs) and 990/995 ATK...  not to bad, and in KC (yea I
stared playing him in KC at 45!) he kicks butt and gets hit a lot less
compaired to other tanks.]

Now why shouldn't I be able to tweek and PL a character if I choose to?  I
pay for the accounts, computers and connections after all....  AND I put in
the time and energy leveling and equip'n him didn't I?  According to your
view instead of taking the inative and putting in around 100+ hours
(easy???) when hes PoP ready PL'n my own melee I should just sit waiting for
a reliable group to form up.. then put up with the "Ding, Gratz, Got to log
now, thanks for the group guys", and start all over again LFG OR spend 6
months getting a Rogue up high enough so we can play our mains!  Bullcrap...
and it really burned my butt having to shuffel around my spellbook because I
couldn't use all the same buffs until Rogue was 46!  Boy that really sucked!
Try having to use 2 different sets of buffs, 6 spells (only HOS and AC
shield took on Rogue prior to 46), a slow, a DD spell, a heal, haste, SOW,
root, Revitalize and Chloroplast which are 14 spells in a miserable 8 slots!
Would have been just a little eaiser with 2 less spells to worry about but I
had it "easy" enough now didn't I!

Personally I'm tired of restrictions on how I play "MY" game imposed by
thoes who are suppose to be providing a service/commodity I purchase monthly
not to mention the inital cost of disks and continued expense of a net
connection!  Hey, if I want to use my 200+hrs in playing already shammy to
PL another character of mine, isn't that my business?  If someone objects to
PL'd characters then push SOE to make it so anyone can see your days played
stat when they con you.  That way the so called pureists can avoid
contaminating their character by not grouping with my miserable PL'd guy...
works for me!  Hell, I won't ever be LFG in another 5 or 6 days anyways!  A
Shammy (with pet), Druid, Claric (with hammer.. lol) and Rogue will do quite
well if/when an Enchanter and/or Warrior aren't around to join OUR group!

Just my nickels worth...  Bottom line, EVERYONE has the right to play THEIR
game when and how they want!

Good hunting and be safe out there...  EQ can be a dangerous place...
especially right after a big patch! LOL
