...which is the nature of the job.

It's like cooking in a restaurant- we are the backbone of the business and 
we make the product available. We get no tips or compliments, but boy do we 
get a whippin' when something is wrong.

The point is in a job like this if you are a self-pitying whiner you crack 
quick and leave for a cushier job.
