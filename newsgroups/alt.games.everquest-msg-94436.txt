    On the encounters that have summoning mobs, Root won't land. We did
Burrower last night (owned hard, early). At one point I cast Complete Heal
and got a couple on me. Because of how chaotic it is, nobody was there to
pull them off me. So my health dropped down to two bubs, at which point mobs
frenzy....

You will not evade me Delores!
You will not evade me Delores!
You will not evade me Delores!

    The screen was a blur as I got summoned by every engaged worm in the
place and whirled around the room like a dwarven toy. When the music ended
and I stopped I was one dead dwarf. After a short while, I get a res box.
Guildchat doesn't indicate a wipeout, must be safe, accept the res. Come
back into the room at the standard post-res two bubs of health....

You will not evade me Delores!
You will not evade me Delores!

    At least I only got summoned twice that time before being eaten. Then I
realized the person ressing me the first time was a recruit and had just
ressed anyone he could see down. Sigh. :-( Still, I didn't fall off the
invisible bridge heading there so it wasn't all bad!
