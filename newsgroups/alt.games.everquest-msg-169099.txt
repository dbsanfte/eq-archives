You were talking specifically about high-end zones/people where NBG is
claimed, and then its sold the next day.

Unless your actively hunting in these zones with these people, how would you
know what was NBG and what wasn't, and on what level?

You know, if you ever see me auctioning a CoF it doesn't mean I got it on
NBG and am now trying to make a fast buck... so what you see in auction
zones doesn't really paint a full picture...

How can you have experience in 55+, or even 50+ groups / loot systems when
your main is 47?

The key thing in this topic, imo, is PICKUP group NBG..  NBG should never
come into it where guildies are concerned, so even if your "uber" friends
let you join them, it still wouldn't be the same.

Not at all.. lol.   Remember, im in an uber guild.  Im drop-dead gorgeous,
im filthy rich, oh and my girlfriend is a super model.

One day I will find a way to change that D to a U on the server selection
screen / EQ website !
