Hi all,

I have my Warrior up to level 27 and a guildie gave me a very nice 1HS 
weapon. My only problem is that I went to 2HS very early on in the game 
as I found the damage output much greater.

Now that my 1HS weapon is so good (my 2HS weapon is rather nice too), 
I'd like to skill up my 1HS without being killed easily. Of course, I 
wouldn't want to impose my ineptitude of 1HS in a grouping situation so 
I'd have to do it solo.

Is it too late to do this at level 27 or can I do the soloing with 1HS 
and get skill-ups while I'm farming tailoring supplies for my trade 
skilling high elf?

Thanks,

Matt
