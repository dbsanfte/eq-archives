It is not the same thing.  Noticing someone look at your shoes is not the
same thing as getting a message that So and So is INSPECTING you.  Maybe it
was intended to be the same, but the effect (because of poor choice of
wording) is completely different.  One is annoying and the other isn't.  Why
is it annoying?  Just because it is.  Maybe it's more like people walking up
to you and TELLING you "I'm looking at your shoes now".  Now having said
that, it does not bother me since I turned it off.  However, even though it
does not affect me if someone ASKS me if it is bad form to inspect I will
say it is bad form because most people do not like it.  That's why Verant
added the ability to turn it off.  Because it is annoying.

Now can someone tell me why it is considered good etiquette to ask before
putting someone on your friends list?  That's the one that boggles me.
