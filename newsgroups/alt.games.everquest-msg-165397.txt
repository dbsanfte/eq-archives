I'm sorry to hear that.

I didn't say Rangers were unbalanced.  I just said that they and the
BL are easiest to compare to casters, which makes them easiest to
target.  Monks were, overall, the strongest of the melees.  They still
weren't unbalanced vs. casters tho, especially in everyday group/solo
play.  Hell, SOE's attempts to balance classes seem to be pretty much
solely in terms of the end-game encounters that only few of us ever
participate in.  From the casual player's perspective every caster is
<way> overpowered vs. every melee.  That'll never get fixed.  What's
really sad is that instead of bringing the rest of the melees up close
to casters with the Monks, they trashed the Monks back down to hybrid
level.  Of course, given the way they've built end-game encounters the
end-game balance would've been screwed by boosting the melees, so the
choice was made before the options were even stated, SOE always takes
the easiest path when it's obvious.

Anybody *can* be nerfed.  Next nerf won't hit melees at all (well, if
you count Bards as melees some of them will suffer a little).  I predict
that just as soon as my Druid dings 35 so he can do the "free xp and pp"
quest out of PoK they're gonna nerf the snot out of it.  This will have
no effect worth mentioning on any Warrior or Paladin.  And my 54 Paladin
will ding 55 someday real soon, and he'll still be a horeshit soloer and
only situationally valuable to a group (fortunately stunnable casters
are in plentiful supply in some places), until/unless I finally get me a
Windblade and raise my damage output over 50% of a Rangers (oh wait,
Ranger can get Windblade too, /sigh, back to stunning).
