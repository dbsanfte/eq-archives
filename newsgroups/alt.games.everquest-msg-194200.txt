My erudite necro is now level 15 playing in Paludal so I'll be 16 tomorrow :). 
A few questions:
What is the best website for us?  Not impressed with casters realm...
I always use a pet when not in a group.  Does everyone else? 
My combat skills are lagging behind my casting.  Do I need to focus on them
more?
I find I'm using Dark Pact *all* the time offset by Lifedraw - I have no money
for kei.  Is this the logical thing to do?
Any other advise?
