}Long spawn time with place holders.  All you can do is kill the place
}holders when they pop, and hope the next spawn is the rare mob you want.

The trick with Grizzleknot is more that nobody seems to agree on what the 
placeholder is or where the path is, even.  I camped him a long time, and 
the closest I ever got was getting to see a druid loot him.  Bah!
