My 17th lvl cleric started the betrayal quest (Freeport to Qyenos).
Doing part one was easy enough - then came the run from Freeport
to Qyenos.

I didn't bother reading any hints about the run through Nektulos
forest, nor did I look at a map. I figured I would do a little
exploring while looking for the dock in the forest. Naturally,
I headed the wrong way, but managed to make it a fair ways
into the forest before getting my first aggro. At which point
things got very bad.

A 17th lvl character is so underpowered there that getting aggro
means almost certain death. Hits were doing like 200 hp
damage to me. Many of the mobs cast spells , so even
sprinting from them is useless. If you are aggro'd you almost
always die.

To make a long story short - I died 10 times in the period of
2 hours, and was unable to retrieve the shards since either
1) they were essentially camped by mobs. In one case the
fish that killed me refused to move more then 5 ft from my
corpse, or  2) what little sprinting I was able to do put my
shard smack in the middle of a pack of mobs. That was
mainly a function of my sprinting in the wrong direction - but
its difficult to run in the right direction when you've got about
10 seconds to live, and lightning bolts are raining down on you.

At the end of the session, my guy was naked (you can't wear
armor that has 0% durability), and I had lost so much strength
that I was burdned by the weight I was carrying. That was
incredibly frustrating because I could barely walk.

Finally, I managed to slink my way back to the commonlands
gate ( I died one last time near there and was revived at
the gate). My xp debt is 140% (i.e. I would have debt for the
next 1.5 levels)

I slowly made my way to the mender at the crossroads, and had
my armor fixed, but - my strength is still too low for the stuff
I am carrying. That leaves me running slowly and I find that
incredibly frustrating. So - at this point I can't play the game
for the next 3 days until my shards (all 5 of them) are
auto-recovered. At which point I have to try that damn run through
the forest again.

My advice to anyone doing the quest - look at a map before you
start.
