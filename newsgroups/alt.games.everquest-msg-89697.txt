 I think it's c as well. We had an unfortunate individual up in Sky the
other day. His corpse conned three hours, so he went shopping and stuff
somewhere. When it was time to res his corpse about 20 minutes later, it
was too old. I'm not sure why came of that. Personally I would have
petitioned and said due to a bug my corpse can no longer be ressed. To
me that's a bug. If it says you have a certain amount of time you should
have that amount.
