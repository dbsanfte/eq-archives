Buy about 6 bags full of muffins in N. Freeport.  Take them to W. Freeport
to the inn and find Pandos.  He is upstairs outside the room with Lady Shae.
Give him four stacks of four muffins and you will get 16 positive faction
hits.  Go through your 6 or so bags of muffins and you should be good to
start your epic.
