The last time I had a group that told me to do manasong and nothing else, I
left in disgust.  I'd rather snap all my lutestrings.

At 56, I haven't done too many 'big mobs, gods, and stuff' with my bard, but
I've done my fair share with my enchanter and wizard (both 65).  I can tell
you what I'm always happy to see bards singing:

1)  Resists.  Most mobs of that level have AOEs, and almost all are
resistable if your resists are high enough.  Bards do better resist than
anyone else, bar none.  Find out from someone who's done this mob before
what their AOE is like, and twist in the appropriate resist song.

2)  Overhaste or Rizlona, depending if you're grouped with the melees or the
casters.  You can boost your group's damage output by fifteen percent by
twisting the right song here.  Consider - if you group with four wizards and
a druid, then (depending on level) those five are dropping 1000 point nukes
every five seconds or so (yes, lots of variance here, just using round
numbers).  Rizlona gives you 150 extra damage per caster, so that's 750
damage every nuke sequence you're adding for the cost of one song!  (Five
seconds of manasong would give each group member 50 or 60 mana, not enough
to wipe your nose with.)  Overhaste will do similarly good things for a
melee-heavy group.

3)  MR reduction (OOS) or mana drain.  Again, gods and dragons are usually
casters and will selfbuff, and anything you can do to make them easier to
hit or keep them from casting is golden.

IF and only IF I'm grouped with no healer would I do manasong during fights;
I'd be using the manasong/healsong combo to keep the group regenning health.
And if there were no casters in the group, it'd be straight healsong -
equipping my lute, I can regen 35 points plus per tick, which adds up.
(It's more than 35 / tick, but I haven't checked in a few levels).

Raivenn,
56 Bard
