Part of the group I was in in Marus Seru TOLD me (my cleric) to go get a KEI -
nexus being only 2 zones over.  Part of the group, (leader included),  said it
was just wasting more time.  No one offered to pay for it, I might add, and as
a cleric I was sitting on my butt most of the time, not looting.  I finally
said I'd go get one.  
Got to nexus, no one was casting it at that time.  So I did the logical thing. 
I logged on my ranger and went solo.  Sometimes a group is more aggravation
than it's worth....
