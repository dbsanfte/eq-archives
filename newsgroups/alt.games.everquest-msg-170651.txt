I've seen something... see if I can dig it up in the dev section of
MircoSoft's web site.

Court battles cost money, so I imagine SoE just dropped the alt-tab
restriction. (I don't care about windowed mode, but I really want Alt-tab to
not crash the program in win2k, because in win2k they can't stop alt-tab, or
the windows keys, from working as intended(TM). They just have to have EQ
die when minimized.) That and DAoC did it. Can't let the competition get a
leg up now can we?
