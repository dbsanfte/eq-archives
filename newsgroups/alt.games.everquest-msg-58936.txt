Sounds like my Druid unless he's pulling...

Group buffs, healing, DOTs, Nukes...  ugh.  lots of down time...

I'd just like to know what groups he is in where he gets to end a fight good
fight with 80% mana.  I'm usually pushing down there a bit...  (makes me
envy Wizards.  No buffs worth talking about, just 1 primary job -- THE big
gun that ends the fight <grin>)

Side Note:
You have to love it when the 2 most versatile classes in the game start
arguing who is better at 1 skill or another.  Leads to some really funny
debates :)
