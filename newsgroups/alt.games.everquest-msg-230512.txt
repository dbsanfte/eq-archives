Yep thats a run all right... and a wait more than likely.

Till then, try waiting in place a while before looting, every time.  I 
often pull, sic pet, maybe nuke, and only get around to looting after 
that, even though I've been standing over the body the whole time.

Well, the boats are pretty good, easy to single pull and kill, and its 
good cash in the form of diamonds and blue diamonds and the like.  The 
exp is pretty bad on most of them, and the one thats decent exp is too 
hard for me to solo well, with caster mobs on it and such, but I'm 
mostly on the Dandolak because I'm with a shaman partner and she's 
looking for the regen chest piece that drops there rarely.

I wouldn't know how it is at 59, only been that level for ten minutes.
