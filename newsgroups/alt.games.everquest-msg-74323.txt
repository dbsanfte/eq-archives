I believe the original documentation from Verant said humans got a
bonus, and didn't say anything about halflings getting one.  The
widespread belief is that this is what Verant intended.  It makes no
sense for halflings to have a bonus.  It would make sense to have one
for humans to compensate for their lack of anything else worthwhile.

Rumor is that they accidently swapped the human and halfling
experience tables, and didn't discover it until after the game had
been released, and couldn't think of a good way to fix it without
having to go and adjust everyone's experience.  They are very
reluctant to do things that involve making changes to existing
characters like that, so the swapped table was left in.

Of course, the way they removed the class-based penalties would have
worked for fixing the human/halfling swap without having to change
existing characters, but by the time they thought of that clever
solution, the swapped tables had been in use for a couple of years,
and everyone was used to humans having no bonus and halflings having a
bonus.
