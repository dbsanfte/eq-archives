That must have changed.  I was a Fighter lvl 9 at the time so definitely had 
access to the city, but only Artisan 6.  I answered as a scholar to his 
query, but after reading your post I went back to see if he would let me 
change it, and he just responded that I was already registered.

So I guess I'll be a scholar when I get to tradeskill 10.  Hehe.
