I wouldn't want to be critical of the way other people play, because
everyone deserves to get out of EQ what the want, but is ZEM really
such a big factor in deciding what zone people play in?

Personally I love LOIO, I spent so long in there with my bard, that I
can now wander safely into the Evil Outpost in Overthere (I assume due
to the 700+ Sarnak shaped notches on my Sabre). It now feels more like
home in there than Freeport.

I have only once wandered into Paludual Caverns, and after seeing all
the bitching and moaning from what was clearly too many people for the
zone to hold, I turned round and went back to the Lake, where I
generally had the zone to myself.

For me, the reason to get the expansions isnt to get the uber gear, or
the huge ZEM, its to explore. While I know these zones have been
played to death, the fact that I can wander into a zone, and be the
only person in there gives the illusion that I really am exploring a
new area.

I could spent 30 levels in PC, but I really wouldn't want to.

As I lay me down to sleep, 
I pray the Lord my soul to keep. 
If I die before I wake, 
I pray I have a recent saved game to go back to.
