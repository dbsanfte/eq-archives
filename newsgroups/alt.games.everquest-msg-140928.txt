Try to tag a dragon, then invis and run back through another 20 dragons to
get that single dragon back to your raid force.  Now try it with an
instant-cast invis item.  Neat how you lived on that second try.

Try to FD underneath a dragon's feet in a total wipe of a raid.  Now stand
up and pull corpses away without dying...

Should I go on?  Instant invis is a powerful thing.  I wouldn't go so far as
to call it overpowering, but it's very very handy.

There's plenty of places that you won't be able to find a non-aggro range
spot.

If monks could use it, it'd cost 200k.  I'd pay it too.

Good thing for me, I have a pre-nerf circlet.  Now one of these days I may
start a SK or necro twink to give it to.  :)  Until then it sits on my
bazaar mule selling at 50k.  I have no real desire to sell it, but it's
gotta sit on a mule anyway.

Of course I had no real desire to sell my gold inlaid ulak either, until
some sucker paid the utterly outrageous price I had on it.  Oh well, now I
can buy a dozen circlets.  :)
