LOL-My first port-I remember buying the spells from Tox then porting around
the few places I could get to thinking "Shit how far am I from home???I can
remember being particularly scared when I first arrived in Lavastorm(a few
lvls later IIRC)-no clue what zones I was adjacent to-furthest Id been was E
Karana.Of course that was waay before Kunark and the worst trains Id ever
seen were in Blackburrow and the nastiest dungeon I knew was Splitpaw-before
it changed:P
The Uberest items were glowing black stones and the Kedge totems for casters
at the time-I had no clue where/what Kedge was,nm what u got the totem from.
