Taken from the 'headline news' at Casters Realm
(http://eq.castersrealm.com):

*** Begin quote***

Our next patch is planned for May 30th, probably
some time in the wee morning hours here on the
West Coast. The important part of the message is
not that, though. It's this:

Due to some of the things we are going to be
doing, there is a small chance that some corpses
might disappear during the patch. GMs will have
the ability to verify any corpses that are lost.
That means that they can help you get them back if
you do indeed lose one. It also means that I
should remind everyone that attempting to scam a
GM about a lost corpse could mean banning.

So please make certain that you have as many of
your corpses cleaned up as possible before the
next patch. We're not expecting a lot of corpses
to disappear, but the fewer lying around, the less
chance of them disappearing.

Thanks.

- The EverQuest Team

Typical that they can't be bothered to ANNOUNCE
what they are doing that would result in a lost
corpse, choosing instead only to threaten us.
