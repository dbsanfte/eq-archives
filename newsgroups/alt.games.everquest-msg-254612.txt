Another question; Last night I tried to set a hot key I left click and held
it there and nothing happened. I have not looked to see if there's a setting
to lock this or not.

I wanted to have a hot key for /loc and /con




Any help is appreciated




PS

This game is so great! I was never sure about playing a MMORPG before but
after playing for about 4 days I am so hooked. I got tired of playing NWN,
Morrowind and Gothic 1 & 2 over and over again. When I saw the 30 day trial.
I said why not. My wife is not to happy about it.
