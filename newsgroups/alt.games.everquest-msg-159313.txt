Aggro management is a concern, but its something you are going to have to learn;
when you can heal, when you can't, whats going to happen when you do... this
stuff changes with your group composition, your targets, your play style and
that of your groupmates.  Its a very serious part of your job, and you are going
to be glad you are wearing plate armor and have great HP buffs.  Note that
number one on the eqclerics.com wish list is "move us to the plate armor
table"... by more than double any other item, and there are over 50 items on the
list.

That said, note that I mentioned the play style of your group mates.  Running
off to pull when the cleric is not ready for them to do so is poor play style on
the part of the tank.  I'd have a conversation with said tank, and there's every
chance I'd leave the group if he can't work with me... even larger is the chance
that I won't invite him to join groups I form in the future, or be eager to join
groups when he's inviting.  Cleric readiness is something that a good puller
keeps in mind, to a large extent, you control the pace, more and more so as you
level up.  You have to start the pullers forming good habits now.

Your job is to conserve mana.  Death is merely the biggest waste of mana on the
block; now you have to rez the guy and put all his buffs back up.  If you flurry
off a bunch of small heals instead of carefully using the most mana efficient
approach you can find, then your group might as well have a druid or shaman as
healer; clerics are the best healers only because they are the most mana
efficient healers.  Since the pace of the group often centers around your mana
flow, the better your mana flow, the faster your group can kill stuff, or the
harder the  targets they can take on.

That said, Chealing smallish tanks on a regular basis may very well NOT be the
most efficient approach.  While Cheal tactics do rely on getting your tank down
to about 20% health at any level, if damage is fast or chunky (spell caster
mobs, for example, tend to do relatively slow damage punctuated by massive
leaps) this can easily lead to unexpected deaths.  And deaths are bad, not only
is there a loss of exp for the dead guy, there's loss of face for the healer,
and there's a strong possibility of more deaths, as you just lost the main
tank.  You need to look at how much more efficient CHeal really is... if its
only buying you a little more HP per mana its probably not worth the risk.

As you level up, though, its going to be more and more worth the risk, as that
80% becomes harder and harder to take care of by any other means; right now a
SHeal might mean 40% heal, but soon its only going to mean 20%, then 10%...
would you try and keep a 44 tank alive using Greater Healing?  How about just
Healing?  While its possible to do so, your mana flow is going to go down the
toilet, and your group is going to be sitting around waiting for you to get it
back far more often than they will find amusing.  With tanks in the 50s and good
gear, CHeal becomes the "must have" solution for hard fights, which is why they
eventually gave a CHeal substitute to high level druids and shaman

If you have the HP, then you will want to CHeal while soloing... but there's no
need to keep it memmed; after the fight, get to a safe spot, swap it in, get
back to full health, and swap it back out.  Of course you'll only bother if you
ended the fight quite low on HP.

Your valor/skin troubles require some research on your part.  Find out what the
skin spells various level druids near your level do, exactly, and figure out
whether your buff is better or not.  If the HP totals are similar and there
aren't any very nice alternative effects packaged in, Valor is better even if
its less HP, because it is probably your most efficient small heal; skin line
buffs do not function as heals, while cleric HP buffs do.  Now, armed with the
facts, converse with the druid, or perhaps with the tank you are healing, these
buffs can be clicked off so yours will land, and you can thus keep your buff on
the people you want it on, or on everyone.  The druid is unlikely to cast skin
repeatedly, since it isn't a heal, so even if you never manage to convince him
not to cast it, you only have to deal with getting it clicked off targets once
every now and then.

Thats a problem you need to solve, though.  A simple solution is a hotkey that
says "Cheal coming for %t in ten seconds, stay near me" is the usual solution,
but at your level you may very well have to converse directly with the target to
arrive at a consensus as to when this is a good idea.  Pullers want to pull the
next mob as fast as possible, because they understand that its kills per hour
that drive the exp bar up and line your pockets with loot.  Your counter is that
landing that heal when they get back with the mob means putting you up high on
the aggro list, while with no mobs in camp, there are no consequences at all to
a heal.  Oh, and if he's mostly dead and runs into trouble, he's all dead....
while if he's fully healed, his chances of surviving are much better.

Yes, its usually not the best plan.

Several plans.  One, make sure you count your peridot use carefully, and get
paid back out of the loot before the remaining loot is split.  This is easiest
if you are also master looter.  Two, insist that anyone who wants a symbol
provide his own peridot.  Better tell people in advance though, because many
people don't carry peridot.  Heck, carry a stack and offer to sell them, that
should take care of that concern.  Three, various plans whereby the cleric gets
the lion's share of the trash loot; this stuff adds up to a pretty penny if you
get it all.  Four, guild supplies all peridot.  If you are always in guild
groups, then just drawing a stack of peridot out of the guild bank whenever
needed should take care of things.  Five, "cleric gets all gems"  this ludicrous
plan means you get nothing in many zones, and then get thousands of PP in some
other zones.  Oddly, clerics on servers with this sort of plan seem to prefer
hunting in zones where gems drop.  Seems silly to me, but different strokes for
different folks.

Cleric can certainly solo, its just that they don't solo Well.  This isn't
because they can't kill a target, its because their kills per hour tend to
suck.  Its about efficiency, not capability.  This said, I soloed from 44 to 54
about half of each level, and did a fair amount of soloing at lower levels and
since.  Soloing means you don't have to worry about finding a group, don't have
to worry that you are only on for a short time, and for me, the very fact that
soloing meant sitting and medding for five minutes between each fight worked in
my favor, I had a great many chores to do, and could kill, do chore, kill, do
chore.... since I had no group to worry about keeping entertained, I could go
AFK for as long as it took, which meant effectively  I was FM every time I sat
down, with no "down time" visible to me.
