Hmm im not sure which robe your refering to... I don't actively keep tabs on
mage gear tho, as he's a long way from ever being my main.

I remember a guildies robe when we first raided Umbral, it was like a cross
between the monks second epic robe (whistling) and a velious quest one, but
it was bright purple.   It looked awesome

I thought it looked really good in that screen shot you posted - is that
before or after the change that you didn't like?
