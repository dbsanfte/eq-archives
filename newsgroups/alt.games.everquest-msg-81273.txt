Regarding the bonus for grouping, I have always heard of this but am
still a bit unclear. On, say, a full group, would the bonus be such
that members end up getting more xp than the larger split they would
get for fewer members?

Iow, let's say a 5-person group kills a 600xp mob. All things being
equal, everyone gets 120xp. However, a full group kills the same mob
and the split is reduced to 100xp. Would the bonus more than make up
for that 20xp loss FOR EVERYONE (in effect adding more than 120xp)? If
not, it would make more sense to keep the group as small as possible
to stay alive and maximize everyone's share of the xp. If however it
simply makes up the difference (adds 120xp and no more) you would at
least have the advantage of being able to kill mobs more quickly.

Then again, even if it didn't add a full 120xp, maybe it adds enough
that keeping the group full maximizes the kill rate/xp ratio.

I don't know - just looking for clarification from anyone who truly
understands the issue.
