This peanut says:

I know what you mean. If it gets too bad, and I am only soloing, or my group
isn't looking for more members, I turn it off. Sadly Guides won't do
anything about it. There is however a new trend that is getting somewhat
annoying:

My server has set up a Market Channel with the new chat system. People sell
and buy there all day long. Fine, great! I sometimes go and have a look at
what is for sale. Then you have the 0ober peeps (Sorry, my l3wt d3wd speek
isn't very good) who INSIST on having stupid conversations on this channel.
Myself, and a few others, suggest, that with this fantasitc new system, they
set up a channel called... *GASP* "CHAT"?! (Would you believe it!!!)
However, Mr and Mrs Annoying decides to turn to Mr and Mrs Nasty and just
flame everyone who suggest this, saying that there are no rules for these
chats... Good thing there is such a thing as a moderator to these chats ;o)
Oh, and the ever popular /leave market :o)

Solitude Dawn :o)
