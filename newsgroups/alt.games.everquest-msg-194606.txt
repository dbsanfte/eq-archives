Today's edition of the Asbury Park Press has an article about EQ
titled "Hot computer game: It's virtually addicting".  It begins with
the following:

====================


By day, Pat Melli owns an auto repair business in Neptune. But at
night, this father of three daughters becomes a barbarian warrior
named "Conanz Deztroyer," fighting beasts in the computer game hit
EverQuest.

"It's basically an escape," said Melli, 36, Eatontown. "It is an
alternate reality. You are assuming the reality of a person, and it's
a whole other world."

====================
