Other stuff cut

Yeah, but thats because you are 29 and mobs are not bad assed yet.
When you get drones of doom at 34 (or something like that) the dwarf
axe ladies in butcherblock pretty much never resist it while they do
often TOTALLY resist your nuke or it only does partial damage. I
started them at 34 on my druid though it was hard until 35 when you
could sit to med and see them coming. 

So it becomes MUCH more mana efficient when mobs can resist your nuke
more. Plus, when you root with an ensnaring you do damage also which
is nothing to sneeze at for not a whole lot mana than lower roots. An
added benefit is that you GAIN mana medding while you are sitting
waiting for the root and dot to wear off. Its just far more efficient.

The alternative is tri or quad kiting but I never found it that
efficient. For one thing, you have to depend on other players not
doing an area and the limited number of spawns if they are. An example
is going way out to timorous only to find someone else is already
claiming lots of raptor spots like a selfish bastard because they want
to quad kite. 

With rooting and doting its much easier to follow the verant rule that
no one owns a spawn and its the first to get aggro who gets it. I
found that doing drakes that way in cobolt scar one at a time, pulling
them off the ridge if they were just standing there down to the sand
below, using ES vambs in addition to my 53 dot and in mana wolf form
that I could be fully medded up and ready for a new one when the other
one dies. I found that much more efficient and fun than doing 4 spawns
at once then having huge downtime medding up. I love using the 49
level root also, it does like 160 damage per reapply so is worth the
100 mana easily.
