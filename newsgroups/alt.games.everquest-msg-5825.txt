Oh, please.

In my two years of playig my wizard, I've never run up to some random
tank type yelling for him to take something off me.  I'm pretty sure
i'm not the only one here who never has.  Where the hell do you hang
out at all day, East commons tunnel?

But, hey, those same tanks that are waiting for me at every damned
wizard spire, typing in "Can u plz port or tl me" before I can even
load in the zone are the same people who will gladly charge me 10k to
get a copy of this exact same spell.

Personally, I'm probably never going to bother picking upthe spell.
Just because I've been burned before by selfish asshole like that, who
think they are entitled to my time simply because "it's only mana".
Fuck you.  If your class don't get it, or your group don't have it,
then dont' come crying to me because I won't TL your sorry ass back to
Firiona.  Enjoy the boat.
