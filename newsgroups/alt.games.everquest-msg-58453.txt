Smithing isn't even remotely the same thing.
You can get to 200+ smithing skill by dumping about 5kpp into it (at
most).

Try getting tailoring past 130.  I can garantee you, the annoyance
factor of tailoring is several orders of magnitude higher than
smithing.

Hell, with Thrug, the biggest annoyance of smithing (having to buy the
components in one zone and get to the forge in another) is removed.

Here's the problem with tailoring:  To raise it, you have to sit
through stupidly boring camps for green crap that you can barely solo
or sit and auction for components that others have collected doing the
same.

There's little time for interaction.  It's not like smithing or
jewelcraft where you just pour money into it and raise the skill by
brute force.  Tailoring actually requires you to hunt since every
recipe requires a mob dropped component.  And once you get past a
certain skill level, it requires RARE mob dropped components and
sometime those mobs can't be killed even with a full group!
