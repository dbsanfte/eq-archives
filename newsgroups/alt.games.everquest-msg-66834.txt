    They could have stayed the way that they were but over time people would
want something better, something with greater appeal for the eye.  One of
Everquest's greatest mistakes is having the game at a position where some of
the lowest pc's can play it.  Like people with not a lot of funds for a new
pc.  This is a step that had to be made.  On newer computers it looks great
but on old ones it is choppy.  Remember that change must happen, like with
everything else in life, it also applies to games.
