Funny how things seem to stop being relevant to you once they're 
clarified in a factual light.

Funny is subjective, I suppose. The OP was wondering which of the two 
games in question to play, and you answered, "RUN ... RUN LIKE HELL. Do 
not pay either of these companies."

I only have a problem with the magnitude of one's venting when it 
amounts to a bunch of opinionated (and aparently not too strongly so) 
hot air. You shouted such a desperate warning in one breath, yet in the 
next you state you will continue to pay for the service and just hope it 
gets better.

I say it was a whole bunch of drama, nothing more. Slander? That was how 
it first struck me. I suppose that may be a bit harsh, but if so, not by 
much.

Whatever. Yeah, I was an AOL subscriber for a year or two in the mid-
90's. Yeah, the service left quite a bit to be desired. Perhaps the 
meaning of your initial reference to AOL wasn't quite clear to me.

Only on the grounds that they sold "unlimited" access and couldn't 
deliver. As you've described it here, it is an even less appropriate 
comparison to SoE. SoE never made any particular uptime guarantee. You 
take it or you leave it. 

I'd be curious to know how the uptime compares on the Legends server in 
EQLive.
