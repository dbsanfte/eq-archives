Make Money Fast & Easy @ Home Using PayPal
 MAKE UNLIMITED MONEY USING PAYPAL!!! $6.00 ONE TIME FEE!!! Can you
really make
money so easily? I thought it was impossible. Just read this. I don't
even
have to convince you that this is not a scam...because it makes logical
sense
how you can earn money through paypal. A little while back, I was
browsing
through a newsgroup, just like you are now and came across an article
similar
to this that said you could make thousands dollars within weeks with
only an
initial investment of $6.00! PayPal is the simplest method of making
and
receiving payments online anyone has ever seen! Anyone with an email
address
can join, for FREE! Please read further before you go there... You can
complete
this whole process in less than one hour and you will never forget the
day you
decided to do so!!! Anyway, it said that you send $1.00 through paypal
to each
of the emails stated in the article. You then place your own email
address in
the bottom of the list at .5, and post the article in at least 200
newsgroups.
(There are thousands) No catch, that was it. So after thinking it over,
and
talking to few people first, I thought about trying it. I figured what
have I
got to lose except $6.00, right? Like most of us I was a little
skeptical and a
little worried about the legal aspects of it: It follows the same
regulations
as the mailed chain letters, which according to the U.S. Post Office
(1-800-
725-2161) is indeed legal! Then I invested the measly $6.00. Well GUESS

WHAT!!?. Within 7 days, I started getting money in my PayPal account! I
was
shocked! I figured it would end soon, but the money just kept coming
in. In my
first week, I made about $20.00. By the end second week I had made a
total over
$1,200.00! In the third week I had over $10,000.00 and it's still
growing. This
is now my fourth week and I have made a total of just over $36,000.00
and it's
still coming in rapidly. Its Certainly worth $10.00., I have spent more
than
that on the lottery!! : Let me tell you how this works and most
importantly,
why it works? Also, make sure you print a copy of this article NOW, so
you can
get the information off of it as you need it. REQUIREMENTS: You must
have a
verified PayPal account. If you do not have an account you can go to
www.paypal.com and follow the instructions to set up a free account. In
order
to place the initial $6 into your account, you will have to verify your
bank
account with PayPal (which may take a few days). Or if you want to
start right
away, use your credit or debit card to make the $6 deposit to Paypal.
Paypal
guarantees your security when using personal information. They do not
release
your information to third parties. Very, very, very, secure! Paypal is
100%
secure and is used my millions of people world wide. STEP 1: Send,
though
PayPal, $1.00 to each email on the below list. Make the subject of the
payment
"Email List" and in the comments, write "PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR EMAIL
LIST."
What you are doing is creating a service by this and best of all you
are not
giving your address to anyone you do not know. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY
LEGAL!
The email list:
..1) whimsical7@excite.com
..2) gamecreator1227@aol.com
..3) capricious1982@yahoo.com
..4) believer_99@netzero.net
..5) ryan1241@excite.com
..6) joughbagh@yahoo.com
STEP 2: Now take the .1 email off the list that you see above, move the
other
addresses up (6 becomes 5, 5 becomes 4, etc?.) and add YOUR email
address (the
one used on the paypal account) as number 6 on the list. STEP 3: Change

anything you need to like the date and spelling, but try to keep this
article
as close to original as possible. Now, post your amended article to at
least
200 newsgroups, message board. (I think there are close to 32,000
groups) All
you need is 200, but remember, the more you post, the more money you
make - as
well as everyone else on the list!
DIRECTIONS: Copy this list to notepad and move the emails up 1 putting
yours at
5. Paste into as many forums as possible, the more people that see, the
more
money you make.
How It Works You receive money on 5 levels. If 10 people respond to
your posts,
you will receive $20. If 10 people reply to each of their posts you
will
receive another $200. Your name is now number 3. If 10 people reply to
each of
those 100 posts you receive another $2000 etc.. Then $20000, then
$200,000.
They more people that see, the more money you make.
A - M - A - Z - I - N - G - !! NOTE: It works much faster without
soliciting or
spamming trying to get higher responses*** !!! With warm wishes, bless
you and 
your loved ones!
