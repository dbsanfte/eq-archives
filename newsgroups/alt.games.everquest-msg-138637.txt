You're making this too hard.  No one says we need to be either
comprehensive or accurate about this.  We make the theory sound good,
package it in a lot of meaningless hype, defend it with
pseudo-science, and  the average consumer will fee right at home.

scientist: one who makes no money while making amazing discoveries
which would change the world if anyone could be bothered to look at
them
entrepreneur: one who makes millions marketing hyped-up nothings which
would be ridiculed if anyone bothered to look at them
