That's correct.  It's wieldable, but does nothing.  It's not a weapon, it's
not a bow.

Well, it did do one thing for me.  The catapult, useless as it is, is the
cheapest way to get your tinkering skill from 122 to 135.  To make the
catapult, you need a shaped ash recurve bow, which trivials in the 140s.

So I spent some spare time in GFay over a couple of evenings getting my
fletching up so I could make the bows to be able to make the catapults to
get my tinkering up.  182 points in fletching to be able to gain 13 points
in tinkering.

And now I see that I need to get my fletching up for the shawl quest.  So I
guess you can say that the catapult helped with that.
