With a group I would think you could start the quests in your mid-20s.
You will most likely need to be in your early 30s (in a group) before
you could finish all the quests.

The quests themselves require gems that will run you 90p-130p on
average, and a lot of time and travel. Some crafted items require more
than 1 gem. 

You are better off hanging out in your servers auction zone and
picking up the pieces you want cheaply from people upgrading, or
running the quests for exp.

At level 30 you could hunt mobs that drop Fine Steel weapons, and make
enough cash to buy the armor faster than you could quest it. You would
also make better exp overall.

Cheers
