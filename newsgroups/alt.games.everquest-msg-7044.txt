Heh... I gained a new appreciation for wizards while camping the evil eyes in
Beholder's maze.  Now *there* are some mobs you really need to finish off quickly.
While the wizard was in our group, we were toasting them like marshmellows.  The 30th
level named EE actually completely healed himself *three* times while we fought him.
We were missing the wizard bad at that point, I assure you.
