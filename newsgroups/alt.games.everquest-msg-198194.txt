I never claimed to know full formula, just what I've seen as the
effect of STA changes.  But I have observed the Warrior thing
you mention, at either 30 or 31 (forget which) I noticed one of
my Warriors gained an extra 75 or 80 hp above his normal per level
increase.  Also, there is some sort of one-off for everybody
under L10 including Clerics, possibly STA-based, your HP at L10
is less than your HP at L1 * 10.  Just observed this for the
umpteenth time with my baby Druid on Stromm.
