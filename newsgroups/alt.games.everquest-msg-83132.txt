Woman's bail cut in half in dog case
Knoller no more risk than Noel, judge says

Jaxon Van Derbeken, Chronicle Staff Writer    Saturday, September 1, 2001


San Francisco -- In a surprise move, a San Francisco judge cut bail in half yesterday for
a woman facing second-degree murder charges in the dog-mauling death of her neighbor.

Superior Court Judge James Warren reduced Marjorie Knoller's bail to $1 million from the
$2 million originally set when she was jailed in March along with her husband, Robert
Noel.

Warren said that while Knoller may be facing more serious charges than Noel -- who is
still being held on $1 million bond on manslaughter charges -- she is no more of a risk to
jump bail.

The ruling followed a daylong, often heated hearing in which prosecutors argued that the
accused couple had strong ties to the "vile, vicious, murderous" Aryan Brotherhood prison
gang. Warren kept details of prosecutors' accusations secret to avoid adding to pretrial
publicity surrounding the case.

In arguing against cutting Knoller's bail, the prosecution also said that the couple are
flight risks and that Knoller had done nothing to help Diane Whipple as she lay dying in
her Pacific Heights apartment building after the dog attack.

The defense countered that the prosecution was "cruel" for suggesting that Knoller let
Whipple die after the Jan. 26 attack by the Presa Canario dog that Noel and Knoller had
been keeping.

The defense stressed that both defendants had an unblemished reputation and strong ties to
the community. Far from letting Whipple die, they said, Knoller had acted heroically.

In the end, Warren acknowledged prosecution arguments about the risks involved but ordered
the bail reduced based on his theory of equal flight risk.

Prosecutors had no comment on the ruling, citing Warren's gag order in the case. But a
private attorney suing the couple for wrongful death was puzzled by the decision.

"It doesn't make sense. . . . I don't understand it," said Michael Cardoza, who along with
his client, Sharon Smith, attended the first part of the hearing.

It is unclear whether Knoller can raise even the reduced bail sum.

"I hope so," said Knoller's attorney, Nedra Ruiz, who added that she disagreed with the
judge and said that bail of $1 million is "unnecessary" because of no flight risk.

"She's stunned; she feels she deserves release on her own recognizance," Ruiz said about
her client's reaction.

At the hearing, Ruiz described Knoller as a "nice Jewish girl from Brooklyn" with ties to
the community and no criminal record.

"There's nothing in this evidence to show she was anything but brave in the face of a
tragedy that would strike most people speechless, that might dement a person," Ruiz told
Warren.

Later she said Knoller "put her body on (Whipple) to protect her from this crazed, damned
dog."

Prosecutor James Hammer bristled at the suggestion that Knoller valiantly fought to
protect Whipple's life.

"If Marjorie Knoller's such a hero, why didn't she give first aid to Diane Whipple while
she was dying?" Hammer said. "If Marjorie Knoller's such a hero, why didn't she call 911?
And if Marjorie Knoller's such a hero, why did she go on national television and blame
Diane Whipple for her own death?"

When he again stressed Knoller's failure to help Whipple, Knoller shouted, "I did too, you
son of a bitch!" That brought a threat from the judge to remove her from court.

Much of the testimony in the hearing concerned the alleged ties the accused may have to
the Aryan Brotherhood, in part through a Pelican Bay State Prison inmate they adopted.

The judge appeared to agree with the prosecution that there was cause for concern, saying,
"The court does find that Aryan Brotherhood is a danger, that people are in danger and
that witnesses in this case are in danger. . . . The Aryan Brotherhood is potentially a
resource of some value to the defense."

He also noted prosecutors' argument on the couple's alleged flight risk. Prosecutors
pointed out that the couple drove at high speeds while being followed by police after
testifying before a grand jury that would later indict them.

That was not enough, however, for Warren to order Knoller's bail kept at $2 million.
