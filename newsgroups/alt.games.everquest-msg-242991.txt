Note this is NOT a good thing to do against high level mobs that repost. The
reason that the tanks go to the back/sides etc. is to avoid repost damage
so the healer only has one person taking damage, sometimes those reposts
hurt, also when the mob RAMPAGES the side/back people can continue to
attack as again it only reposts the front people.
Yes as a rogue I know it sucks to have the mob turn, but if it is turning
find out who it is turning to and either make them MT or tell them to stop
taunting etc.
