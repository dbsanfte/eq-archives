Hi,

If anyone reads from Australia, especially Melbourne, and uses game 
cards can you *please* tell me where you can buy them from?

My friend that I have an agreement with- "I give you $25-30 [whatever 
the exchange rate at the time]" and he'll give me his card details has 
gone interstate and I need to be able to get into the game.

I've searched the internet and been unable to come up with anything. If 
anyone can help here I'd appreciate it.

Matt
