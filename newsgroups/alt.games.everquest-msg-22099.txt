Okay, if "kitty" is an adjective and thus a word on its own...what
does it mean?

I do stand corrected, however, kitty is a word on its own:

kit�ty2 (kt)
n. pl. kit�ties 
A cat, especially a kitten 

However, it is still not a phrase when combined with "cat". Both words
mean the same thing. It is most _definately_ not an adjective. It is a
noun. "Kitty" is a "cute" form of cat or kitten.
