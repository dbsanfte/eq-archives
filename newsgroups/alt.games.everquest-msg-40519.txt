Yep, and I've never heard of a way around it either. My partner has only just
now gotten her skill up to where she's making her first cultural plate. Did
regular plate before that.  I'd guesstimate that she's already got between 5
and 7 KPP into the effort. You want to make cultural, just be prepared to
flush a crapload of plat into it. I don't think there's any way around it, and
it also explains the distinct lack of characters running around in Culteral.
By the time you an afford to make it, you're probably close to getting planar
armor.  And nobody of a reasonable level can likely afford to buy it for the
rediculous prices you'd have to charge to attempt to make up for what you
invested in it.
