There is another way to get to OT, but you really do need a SoW and a good
map to do it.  Actually there are several ways, this one involves running
through the Goblin tunnels to Warsilk Woods, and then from there to OT.  I
did that, the other way, as I was a good race fighting in OT, and wanted to
to some banking.  I was bound in OT, being a Shaman, I could bind anywhere
(just about), but the rest of our party bound just inside the wall near the
water in OT.  I zoned to WW, ran through the tunnels (Iksar in the WW zone,
Goblin in the LoIO zone), to LoIO, ran on across to FV, did my banking,
buying, selling, then Gated back.  Good luck,
