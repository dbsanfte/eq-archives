Finding myself on for an hour here or there a lot these days, and I've 
outgrown my old solo spots.  I've also found that the wait for LFG can 
run over an hour sometimes, so a spot I could make use of that LFG time 
in would be handy even if I'm on for a longer period.

I'm a poorly equipped 62 mage, with Run 3 and a really cheap drogmar.

Recently my favorite soloing spot was Velks, as I could roam around 
finding spiders, which my pet could eat with me providing fire support 
and healing.  I went back there a couple days ago when I only had half a 
blue left in 61, and managed to crank that half a blue out, but almost 
every spider I saw was Cyan.

I'm looking for somewhere with dark blue to level 62 mobs which I can 
get mostly in singles without any pulling tool worth the name (mages not 
only don't get harmony/lull, but don't even get Root!), which don't 
summon, and which I can kill in a reasonable amount of time for the exp.

They'd also have to be located near a POP book since the whole point is 
to do this while I have short playing times; I wouldn't want to travel 
acrosss 5 zones and thread my way deep into a dungeon before starting, 
if that takes half my play time!

I'm also not clear on the latest status of pets and exp, having been 
away for several months;

1) I do all damage, I get all exp
2) Pet does all damage, I get ? exp
3) Pet does 99% damage, I do 1% damage, I get ? exp
4) Pet does 51% damage, I do 49% damage, I get ? exp
5) Pet does 49% damage, I do 51% damage, I get ? exp
6) Pet does 1% damage, I do 9% damage, I get ? exp

I believe that 5) and 6) result in "I get all exp" as well, and that 3) 
and 4) are both the same thing as each other... but not sure what that 
thing is.  And I think 2) is a different answer than 3) and 4), but also 
not sure what that is.

If all I have to do to get the lion's share of the exp is to do at least 
a little, then I can pull with a nuke and then run in circles while my 
pet does the killing, only stopping to renuke if my pet gets aggro.

If I have to outdamage the little guy, though, seems like that will be 
difficult while kiting, as Run 3 isn't -that- much faster than the mobs, 
and I need a pretty good lead to get a nuke off before the mob reaches me.

Also, doing 51% of the damage to each mob can be pretty expensive in 
mana terms.

Depending on how the percentages break out, it might be better for me to 
take the reduced exp and let the pet do almost all the work, if I can 
kill proportionally more mobs sufficient to make up for the lost percent 
of exp.

I've been kiting mobs in a group in the HOH graveyard recently, and that 
looks like its easy to pull (might get several mobs) and has a lot of 
simple flat running room, but the mobs have a fair amount of HP and hit 
hard enough to polish off my pet fairly quickly if they turn on him. 
Considering trying my luck there, but it sure won't be the head to head 
pet on mob fights I'm used to from Velks.

Splendid One, 62 Gnomage, Firiona Vie
