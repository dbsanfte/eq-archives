OK, first thing is to start a character on any server OTHER than Fironia 
Vie.  That is the LEAST populated server, and for a number of reasons 
rather tough to play on.

Hmmm, not sure if your cousin is in Freeport or Qeynos; neither are really 
great newbie areas, but not bad either.  Starting with a warrior isn't a 
bad idea, since it's simple, but it may not be the playstyle your cousin 
wants.  I would recommend that your cousin create a character on your 
server, and you show your cousin around for 30-45 minutes.  Show how to 
turn in the guild-note, how to zone, where the newbie area is, how to 
sell, etc.

Hmmm, might explain that swimming is tough until you get some skills up, 
but this is one everyone learns on their own.

Teach your cousin the /rude command.  It seems to be the best response to 
jerks, and it makes me giggle watching some characters do it.  Especially 
gnomes.

Now here is where you need to explain that the best way to move up is to 
kill stuff.  This is a combat oriented game, and you will be doing tons 
and tons of killing.  Maybe drop a twinkie weapon or something on the 
character, explain the /con system, pull a couple mobs to demonstrate.

One of the things you might want to do if your cousin really needs the 
backstory to get interested is to send him to www.everquest.com and have 
him run through some of the backstory info.  There is a HUGE backstory, 
but due to the nature of the game, a single character can't do much to 
change it.

Everquest is a tough game to get into, especially if you haven't played 
massively-multiplay, persistant games before.  I know that I probably 
would have given up after a couple hours if I didn't have a friend who was 
very into it who showed me around a bit.  Of course he was only level 17 
or something, and had never been to Greater Faydark before, and knew 
nothing about a bard, but just him showing me how to shop and fight and 
recover my corpse got me over that first frustating block.

bard of waaayyyy to many days /played
