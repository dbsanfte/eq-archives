I have been told by a friend that I could one / both of these as the 
loot is reasonable.

I have been to Katta, everything indifferent.  Whilst there did the 
foraging machete quest for the heck of it - now to see if it sells for 
500pp!  If so, then it's an easy quest and reasonable source of income. 
That quest got me a faction hit against Seru, which encourages me to 
target Sanctus Seru and leave Katta friendly.

Part of the reasoning behind this is a to find a source of income, 
preferably with XP too.  I have been hunting Wyverns in Cobalt Scar (are 
there any druids who don't??), but obviously when busy this becomes less 
profitable and the XP has dropped off.  I have been hunting PoN and got 
to grips with it now and am getting good XP (a couple of kills netted me 
almost 3%!), even if I am just Root/DoT since I am almost unable to 
charm ravens.  Did charm one, finally and used it to kill a Treant then 
killed the Raven, but I just cannot get charm to stick - snare/glamour. 
Call of karana is what I was trying.


So, is this a reasonable idea?  Will I live to regret the faction hits 
against Seru?  I haven't actually been there yet, perhaps they already 
hate me :)
