Ok. Here's my situation. I play nearly every weeknight for at least a
couple of hours after the kids go to bed. I also normally play several
hours over the weekends. You would think that getting guilded and
raking in the xp would be the logical thing to do, right? Wrong. Let
me throw in a monkey wrench here...

I have 16 characters. So many that when someone asks me what my main
is, I have trouble giving a definitive answer. I like to play several
different class/race combinations on a couple different servers (one
being FV and then one blue server).

Now, since I spread my time out among them, I don't level any one up
too quickly. Therefore, I normally have trouble finding anyone of
similar level to group with - get to know for any length of time - get
a guild invite from. I'm a bit of a transient of sorts. I responded
once to a recruiting shout and joined that guild briefly (yeah, I
know, never works out) and kind of felt like I was at a party where I
didn't know anyone - make that a slumber party. I soon /guildremoved.

/uh, ramble on...late...

I don't know. Maybe I should level them up one at a time until they
are all high enough to group with a wider range of levels. It's just
nice to be able to take a break from a particular class whenever you
feel like it.
