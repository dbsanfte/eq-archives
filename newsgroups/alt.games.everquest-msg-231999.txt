Yeah. The hobbit was a bedtime story for his kid, for the most part.
He liked to tell tales like that. It is kind of simple in parts,
though still a good read. For instance, in the Hobbit the wizard is
hanging around with the dwarves for some reason. This is not really
explained. It is interesting that the appendix at the end of Return of
the King does state the reason, though Tolkien probably had not
thought of it when he wrote The Hobbit. 

It states in the ROK appendix that Gandalf was in the bar in Bree, or
somewhere, thinking about how horrible it would be if the Dragon Smaug
came under the power of Sauron. Then he saw Thorin there, whom he knew
as one of the dwarves who was ran off... I'd love it if Jackson did
make a film version of the Hobbit, if  he put in things like that
which tied it in with the Lord of the Rings.

Lord of the Rings was a story he made around some languages he was
playing with. They wanted a sequel to the hobbit, while I think he
wanted something else. I even wonder if he meant for the ring to be
anything more than a magic invisibility ring in The Hobbit; its just
nutty how the sequel took such a thing and made it the focus of an
Epic.
