No, you know that is not the case from the previous parts of our
conversation.  I only ridicule the ridiculous.

Did I ever claim to be tolerant?  Please control these flights of
fancy of yours, they make rational discourse impossible.

That should be no problem, since you are making no effort at
"discussion", adult or otherwise.  To "discuss" takes two or more
people, and you are too busy talking with yourself.  You debate your
points against what you want to read into my posts, and my meaning
conveniently escapes you.  This habit of yours got noticeably worse
once you realised that I would not be sidetracked and that you had
failed to defend your premise re: "special rights".
