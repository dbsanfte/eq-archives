Oh man, it was like Christmas when someone came to Halas selling bronze
armor.  I was rich enough to buy a couple of pieces even though it was one
plat per ac.  I had just completed upgrading from cloth and various to all
rawhide too.  Wasn't bad for mid teens, heh.  Those were the days...  Not
even going to start the story on saving up till level 30 for the
executioners axe and showing it off to everyone in the zone.  Course this
was Rallos Zek, and in the old days when you could attack level ones, plat
was a might scarce to come by.

Reorth mid 30's Warrior Rallos Zek

btw, he's camped in KC hoping for some of that no drop trash armor we all
ignore on other servers.
