Perhaps you don't quite understand the role of the GM. They are not meant 
to give hints on quests, bugged or otherwise. If the NPC were, in fact, 
merely moved, they wouldn't be able to tell you one way or the other.

That's part of it. If you search and fail to find the necessary NPC, your 
choice is to keep searching, put it off until later or give up. GM 
assistance is not meant to be available for that.
