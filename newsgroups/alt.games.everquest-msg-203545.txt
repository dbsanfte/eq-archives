I read through the interview and the resulting player comments. It seems
that a lot of folks are seeing this as detrimental to the guys (like me) who
can only be on a short time and thus feel pretty much forced to solo. I take
the opposite view because of one point stated in the interview.

It seems that these dungeon crawls are designed to take less than one hour.
As you may remember from my previous ramblings, the primary reason I don't
group is that most groups get po'ed if you have to split after an hour or
two. It look to me like this content would actually make it *easier* for the
casual player to group up for an hour or so.

It also seems that with the dungeons ending after around an hour, some
people might leave, and others would be wanting to regroup and try another.
I suspect that finding a pick-up group would be fairly easy.

The only drawback I see is that it would not be as attractive for those
classes that function best outdoors.

Other thoughts?
