(just

Not really, the best druid nuke is even slightly stronger then a mage nuke
(not counting ancient spells). And the mage's is a bolt which means a harder
time targetting (7 second casting and need a line of sight? Just try it) and
in raids practically useless.

Druid:
60: Moonfire   - Cold Based Direct Damage (Max: 1100)
60: Ancient: Starfire of Ro  - Fire Based Direct Damage (Max: 1125)

Mage:
59: Seeking Flame of Seukor  - Fire Projectile Direct Damage (max: 1024)
60: Ancient: Shock of the Sun  - Single Target Fire Based Direct Damage
(Max: 1125)


And that stings for my char that was supposed to be the No 2 nuker in the
game.
