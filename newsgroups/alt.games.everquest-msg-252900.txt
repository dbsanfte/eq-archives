Um, no, sir.  I kindly disagree.  In order for a contract to exist, their
must be adequate consideration on both sides of the deal.  In our little
hypothetical we've decided that the pebble's worthless, hence it is not
adequate consideration, and no contract exists between us.

Now in my initial post I was a little overzealous.  The two sides do not
have to trade items of roughly equivalent value.  Instead, in a substantive
transaction, each of us must feel that what we've given up in the
transaction is the price of what we've received.  Hence, if I pay $500 for
an ounce of gold that will be a valid transaction, but you can't show it in
a case where someone has agreed to pay $1000 for a worthless item.  And
remember, in our hypothetical, the pebble's worthless.

Who gives a shit why someone entered into an agreement like that in the
first place?  The court's not going to force someone to pay a thousand
dollars in exchange for an item of no value.  It's unconscionable.

This is pretty basic contract law.  You ought to look it up sometime.

The only question that remains in this larger discussion is whether the
platinum in question is worthless.  Nobody seems to have taken issue with my
comments on that particular question.
