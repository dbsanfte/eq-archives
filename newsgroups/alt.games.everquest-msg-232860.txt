I don't consider "on Cartoon Network" to be released.  DVD, baby, DVD.

Still not as bad as what they did to Escaflowne and Cardcaptor Sakura.  I
mean, cut out the opening episodes (in the case of CCS, everything before
the arrival of Li-kun, so that they could make him the lead instead of
Sakura), changes in genre, and changes in name.  Madison????  What the
hell??  To-mo-yo.  Six letters, three syalbles... not that tough to say.
