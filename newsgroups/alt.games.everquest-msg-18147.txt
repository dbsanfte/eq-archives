I'd certainly *like* more spell gems - what caster wouldn't? However,
this isn't an interface problem, it's a conscious design decision on
the part of Verant. They've stated in the past that this is how they
want it, and it won't be changing.

It just means that you have to actually give some thought to which
spells to memorize for different situations.

An annoyance, yes, but a very very minor one.

The game seeks a level of immersion. To provide auto-mapping would
dramatically reduce the immersion level. You are *in* the world, not
watching it from cloud level. Learn the way around.

It goes away when you hit 35.
