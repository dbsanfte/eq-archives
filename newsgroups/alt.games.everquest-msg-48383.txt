I noticed something interesting with this last night: apparently,
playing a character that can't speak the 'set' language won't reset it
to common; the only thing that changes it appears to be the /lang
command, or making a character on Firiona Vie...
When I logged in last night, I created a FV halfling druid in case I
ever feel like playing there, got the third of the three name
alternatives I wanted to try to get, didn't log in (not a fan of level
1 zergling rushes), switched to EMarr, logged in my gnome to check
something, talked to someone, logged in my dark elf to change some
hotkeys, talked to someone, logged in my wood elf druid, talked to
someone and was met with puzzlement. Turned out my druid was trying to
use her below average skill in Halfling to communicate with the world,
while my gnome and dark elf, who have no knowledge of halfling, had
been happily using common.

Personally, I think the language in eqclient.ini should be reset to
common when you're playing a character that can't speak the requested
language.
