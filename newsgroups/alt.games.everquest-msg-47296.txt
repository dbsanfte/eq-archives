Yes, you are the person sitting in the government intelligence office
hearing that there will be a major attack on US soil and chose to ignore it.

You are the government in the cribean who had written testimony that arab
extremists were going to hijack jets in the USA and use them for the worst
and simpyl ignored it.

You are the person continues to think that the worst has passed and that
nothing like this will happen again...

I have news for you, the rest of our lives will be considering this. Proper
and reasonable plans and defenses for you and your family are not being
paranoid. If something happens in your area requiring a qaurintine, you are
ON YOUR OWN.
