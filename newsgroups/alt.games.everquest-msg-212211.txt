Certainly, and when I wasn't taunting continuously the paladin would
turn the mob pretty much every time she proc'd.

True, but then you'd have to assume that one of us was positioning
differently all the time when I wasn't pressing taunt as soon as it
cycled. It was the difference between loosing agro maybe once every 2
or 3 fights due to a string of procs and loosing agro every time the
pally had a proc (several times per fight). I wasn't using proccing
weapons (LSoEE and Defender's Lightblade) so that didn't affect things
in any way.

I was thinking high end because at lvl 60 I get an unresistable spell
that always adds one point of hate when it lands (Malo). Assuming a
warrior taunts with his back turned so he doesn't riposte, popular
wisdom says that I should be able to take agro back from a successful
taunt with two casts of Malo. What I saw tells me that won't be the
case. I'm convinced there's something else factoring into the equation
and a successful taunt isn't just highest hate + 1. 

... not that I have any idea what! <g>
