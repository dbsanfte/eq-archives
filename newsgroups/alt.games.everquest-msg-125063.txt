hehe, thanks for sharing this link.  Some of us do appreciate sick
humor..Some of his stuff is very funny.

One comment on the RL Girl playing EQ.  His webpage makes fun of that, but
it happens.  Had this guy telling our whole guild about this 23 year RL
Female Dark Elf he met.. LOL

btw, for the noobs who are starting eq or the 24/7 Beggars at East Commons.
I highly suggest you make a Female alt and make some common female emotes
like /giggle /smile and such.  A friend and I did this and within a few
weeks we came out with some nice gear, particularly low to mid levels.

Your acting skill has gone up (55) !
