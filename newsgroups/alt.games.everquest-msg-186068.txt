Something similar happened to a friend of mine about a year ago.  He 
went LD while zoning ahead of a train and didn't realize until too late 
that the server had declared him dead.  The GMs said they couldn't get 
the corpse back but they gave him some nodrop armor to use until he 
could get some new stuff.  The guild pooled resources and got him some 
decent equipment.  This kind of thing happens, but you do eventually 
recover.  Hopefully someone will be able to help you at least a little. 
  If so, treat anything you are given as the gift it is.  Good luck!
