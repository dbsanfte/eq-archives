I am not sure if this has been posted.

Putting containers into other containers seems like it may be a little
hard to code. I would think an easier code is to have either a
separate weight when items are in the trade container versus when no
items are in the container or simply a weight penalty when items are
in it. That way a monk could carry the bag iwithout worrying about
excess weight and do his/her trade skill stuff. The only thing he
would have to do is monitor looting stuff to make sure his wt doesn't
jump up 2 or so units of weight due to a trade container containing
items.

Just a thought.
