Big thumbs up, but don't do it to the exclusion of other ways
to play the game.  Some people LIKE xping, some like tradeskills,
etc.  Of course, many of these can be part of quests.  (I'm not
sure how to make "stand around and gab in PoK" be a quest, though. :-)

These two would be very useful and obviously mesh together well.

Oh yes, please!!  I often put someone on Friends after meeting them
in a particularly good pickup group, and then three weeks later I
get a hail or tell from such a friend and I have trouble remembering
just where it is I know them from.  (E.g., does this other person
I'm already grouped with remember them also, or was he not with me
that night?)

Please NO.  If I want you to know who my alts are, I'll tell you,
and you can add them to your Friends and/or in the above-mentioned
"notes" field for my main.

Messages to off line characters is an interesting issue.  Is there
the potential for spam?  In theory Sony could always track down an
abuser since the sender's account is known, but I'm still worried
about a spammer getting a 30-day free trial, going around adding
everyone he sees to his Friends list, sending his spam, and then
dumping the account.

What are people's experiences with those games that do offer character
mailboxes?  (I think CoH is one?)

This is tricky.  CoH pulls it off okay.  The high-level can take on
the lowbie as a "sidekick", in which case the lowbie's stats and powers
improve (while sidekicked) as though they were the mentor's level minus 1,
but they don't get any of the new powers they'd normally acquire en route
to that level.  Or the high one can be an "exemplar" to the lowbie, in
which case the high level's stats and powers are reduced as if they were
one level below the lowbie.  In either case, the pair can then operate in
an area against mobs suited to their now-similar levels.  But in EQ there
are a lot more things that come into play: equipment (including required
levels), spells (much more so than CoH powers, I think), lots of
different level-based skill caps, etc.  I do think what you suggest is
possible, but it's a much harder problem than it was in CoH.

Agreed.

What?  They need more?  The tutorial is great, though as someone else
remarked recently it does tend to keep many newbies from ever exploring
their newbie yard or doing early quests.

Ick.  Isn't there already a channel for The Newbie Zone?  But I'd
dread what such a channel would look like if people were automatically
added to it.  Half the messages in it would be from people telling the
other half to stop filling the channel with crap.

Don't auto-learn skills.  Some of us think part of the excitement
of gaining levels is that sometimes it's time to go find a trainer
and learn new skills.  As long as I don't have to do it too often,
it's a nice break and sense of accomplishment.

Actually, the awkward part for me is the hotkeys.  When I want to
make an ability PART of a hotkey, I have to figure out which ability
number the key is, and what's worse, I have to dedicate the ability
key forever to that skill or the hotkey changes.  E.g., my "feign
death" hotkey is: /attack off, /doability #, /loc.  This requires
that one of my 10 settable action or combat buttons be set to feign
death, and never change.  And some skills can go on either combat
or action buttons, while others are only action buttons, etc.  It's
a pain to organise.  Why can't the hotkey just say "/doability feign
death"?  (Note: I do keep the action window up, because I use it to
see when the abilities reset.)
