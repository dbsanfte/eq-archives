Ah, good to know, thanks.

In any case, I was thinking further about the "vendor survey" idea,
and realized that since every PC probably has a different mix of
factions, the best solution is for each PC to do what the smart
ones do anyway -- just check all the vendors in their favorite
"shopping area" and note which one gives the best prices for
that particular PC, then use that vendor in the future when
selling loot.

Hehe.  I'm currently working on kissing up to the Neriak Clerics
and the Oggok residents, both of which are a bear to work with
if you're starting out KoS.  And I need to get back to Cabilis
one of these days and make friends with the Necros, so I'll
have a clean sweep of lizardland.
