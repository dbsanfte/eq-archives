- The server selection screen now only gives information on whether or
not a server is up instead of providing player counts.  In addition,
the "count" option on the /who command has been restricted to internal
personnel.  Servers on the server selection screen are still ordered
from least-populated to most populated in order to assist players in
choosing the least populated server.-

Why change this? Too much bitching about needed server splits?
