Not at all. Zeppo got his own service revoked by breaking the terms of
service that his provider required. All DT did was bring the breach to
the attention of the service provider.

Airnews is positively rabid about enforcing their TOS, as a couple of
your FAg buddies could no doubt attest, having had their Airnews
accounts closed in an amusingly public way.

I see you're happy to attack DT over his actions in this, but that you
apparently have no comments about the behavior of Zeppo. This
demonstrates a clear bias on your part, as far as I can see.

Not a particularly clever dramatization, and meaningless anyway as we
actually have the text of the message DT wrote.

Anyone who has a reasonably solid history in this newsgroup can tell
you that we handle pretty scathing flames regularly. We're not
thin-skinned. On the contrary, our 'problem' is that we have very
little patience for stupidity.

Norrath is a make-believe world. A.G.E. is a real community.
