You've been rather unlucky it seems, I've rarely been /anon or /role and
I've *NEVER* had anything like that happen (except a couple RL friends who
like to harass me at times).

Worst experience with persistent morons was the guy who argued against the
ENTIRE auction channel that fungi's were 90k, then when I looked  back at
the channel an hour later it had digressed into him and "Barney" raping
women by using Rohypnol that they pick up while "cruising" in "Barney's"
van.  I hope that guy finally got banned.

Or if you want 'personal' harassment, it would probably be the guy who asked
me to "help and earn 100pp", I asked him what he wanted and he just said "nm
you're busy", I was like "wtf, I don't just say YES MASSA! to some nebulous
"help plz"
