If by "wrong" you mean illegal, then yes, it is wrong to drive 85 through a
school zone whether or not there's a cop around.  But if by "wrong" you mean
immoral, well, it will be harder to prove that either way since what is
immoral has been debated for thousands of years.  However I can say that it
seems to be wrong to drive 85 in a school zone because there is a large
probablity that you will cause destruction or loss of life.

As for ShowEQ, the moral reason it should not be used is because it gives a
significant advantage over someone who does not have it.  The ShowEQ user
knows when rare mobs pop and where the choice mobs are.  They are at a clear
advantage over the rest of us.  Since the players in EQ do compete against
each other, the ShowEQ user can level faster and make more money which
lessens the normal player's experience.  When normal people make 1000 plat
or hit level 50, they want to it to mean something. That they did a
significant amount of work.  Not just that they zero'ed in on some rares and
found the choicest blues with ShowEQ.

But one thing to consider is that any information gathered outside of the
game can be considered cheating.  The fact that you are reading an eq
newsgroup means that you have an advantage over someone who doesn't.  Or you
might read websites to find out equipment or quests that are great.  I think
this website is at the low end of the cheating scale while ShowEQ is at the
high end.  The final arbitor is Verant and if you do something they don't
want you to do you are cheating.

I've noticed how people don't like to consider anything they do as being
"wrong." They will come up with any type of justification so that it is
right.  It's like if you went over to someone's house and they asked you not
to smoke but you lit up anyway and said "There's no law against smoking and
I'm addicted so I'm going to smoke blah blah blah."  If you're doing
something wrong, leave it at that. You're doing something wrong. But don't
come up with wacky arguments to justify your bad behavior hoping we'll
salute you or something. (By "you" I don't mean Dan. I'm talking in general
about people who try to justify their actions even though Verant has asked
them not to do something.)
