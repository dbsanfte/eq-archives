Interesting, was he slowed that much? [1] When you hear of mobs being
immune to slow, I always thought that meant "By all means". We could
always sacrifice a few Shamans for a lau^W^W^ comparison.

What he said. [2]

Good luck Orlun, personally I went from an Eyerazzia and an FBSS back
when I got mine. The all-around improvement was nothing short of
astonishing, and now I need an even bigger stick to beat off inspectors.
