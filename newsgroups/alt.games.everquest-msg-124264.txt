Hello,
I am trying to do some Necro quests.
The book I meantioned earlier is the "Writ of the Fallen"
Fairly easy for a lvl 10-12 and great stats.
Now, for another quest I need 2 DF scout scalps and a bottle of red wine.
I am guessing the wine is available at a vendor???
As for the scout scalps... where do you find them?
I heard this was broken. Any info?
Thanks!
