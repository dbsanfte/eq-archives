As a barbarian shaman, I ended up making a few odds and ends of my cultural
armor to fill in gaps in my armor that had no wis stats.  Since then I have
replaced some of those pieces, but I am still wearing some of it.  I would
definately not suggest running out and making a full set, but a few pieces
are handy.  Of course, my smithing was already in the 140s, as I became a
smith in order to be able to make banded armor for myself, my twinks, and
friends.  I was fortunate to not know how bad banded armor really is when I
started, compared to stuff I could have been hunting/shopping for.  I say
fortunate, because without that lack of knowledge, I would not have taken up
smithing, and my wisdom would be a bit lower.  My smithing has actually come
close to paying for itself, as I have not made any FS, and banded is
relatively cheap to make, and I have managed to sell a few sets.  I also
have the added benefit of being able to make SoW potions, which have paid
for all of my tradeskill habits.  I would not recomend picking up a
tradeskill with the idea of making yourself great armor, pick it up because
you will have fun with it.  If you find you need to fill in a few spots, you
should be able to find someone who can make it for you.
