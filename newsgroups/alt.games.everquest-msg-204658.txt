Generally agree, but for a cleric Combat Agility is often preferable
to Natural Durability. Reason being that if the MOB doesn't hit you, your
spell casting isn't interrupted. (And taking 10% less damage is
functionally about the same as having 10% more HP.) (*)

ND is preferable if you're hit by spells a lot, but in PoP I find I take
a lot more melee damage than spell damage.

        ...Ronny

(*) Technically it's marginally better (roughly equivalent to HP+11%) but
casters skew this the other way since CA doesn't affect spells.
