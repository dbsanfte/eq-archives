The weapon
eg. 10/25 You roll a slash, it connects and dmg is calculated on the roll of
1 - 10
eg. 10/25 +3 Fire Dmg. On attack roll it calculates the 3dmg against the
resist rate of that modifier against the mob. so you will get either 10/25
ot 13/25 depending on the resistance of that mob to the modifier (Fire in
this case) doesnt mean you hitting 10 - 13 every attack roll as the 10 can
be 1 - 10 to start with.
