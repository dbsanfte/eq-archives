Because a hungry dwarf is a grumpy (-ier) dwarf..
And if he is grumpy the missus he is guarding in the inn will be miserable
and if she is miserable the whole elven tribe suffers.
So keep the dwarf well fed, the princess (cause that's what she is, right?)
will be happy and the people of elfdom will like you alot.

There, mysetery solved!
