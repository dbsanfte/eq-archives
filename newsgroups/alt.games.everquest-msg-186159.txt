    Right about now is when I remind you about my estimate that Plane of
Time would first be entered sometime around mid-March, 2003. You know, the
guess that you actually made fun of on Graffe's as being way, way too long?
One elemental god (or in this case, group of gods) to go, it's March 10th.

    I was always good with those jars of jelly beans, too, where you had to
guess the number of beans. ;-)
