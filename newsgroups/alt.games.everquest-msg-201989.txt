I was going to purchase a ATI 9100 128 MB card but then I was told its
"nothing more than a 8500 with a fancy name" and its not worth the
money. I was then advised to purchase a TI4200 and I was then told by
someone else to "go buy a FX5200" as it kicks both of their asses...
in his own words.

Which card is good for Everquest?

My system specs are:

Celeron 466 Mhz
384 MB RAM
and I believe it's a 250W Power Supply. Not sure though.
