Group,

I decided to try the Mage Armor quests to add interest to my EQ
experience.  I started in Felwithe, and got the Curing Kit, Glove form
and ingredients list.  Once I had all the ingredients, I hit combine
and it worked fine.  One problem: I'm Human, and the item, gloves,
were HIE (High-Elf?) only.  DOH!!

I journeyed to Freeport to see Shana Liskia on the 2nd floor of the
Mage tower and got the Human equivalent, with the exception that I
received an 8 slot Enchanted Sewing Kit instead of the Curing Kit.
Again, I gathered all the ingredients and hit combine.  This time,
nothing but the wrong container type message.  I went back to repeat
all the messages to recheck items and instructions but seem to be
doing everything correctly.  I also tried it with another item,
sleeves, but had the same problems.  Shana did mention a loom, but a
couple shouts yielded no help.

Can anyone give me some help with this?  I've spent a couple hours on
it, so I figure it's time for some tips.  

Thanks,
Julie
