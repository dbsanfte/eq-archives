Actually, the romans killed Him.  Hey, let's sack Rome to take revenge!
Anyways, the funny thing is, anyone who blames the Jews for killing Christ
completely misses the point.  If He is who He says He is, than no one can
_kill_ Him.  On top of that, it was neccessary that He die, as outlined in
Romans.  How can we blame the Jews for helping Christ fulfill His mission?
Intent?  Is that all it comes down to?  By Christian beliefs, had they not
killed the Savior, none of us would be redeemed.

I don't buy that.  If a judge can't separate his religious beliefs from his
jurisprudance, than he's not qualified to do the job, whether he displays
them prominantly or not.

Agreed
