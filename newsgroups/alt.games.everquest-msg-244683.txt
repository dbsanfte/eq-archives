Don't know what class you are but, if you are a melee type, just keep
fighting while you are blinded.
Don't move. The mob will stay in front of you unless you get it down to
where it runs.
Don't worry, it will come back (heheh).
But, it is nice to have a non-melee friend with some spells to help out.
