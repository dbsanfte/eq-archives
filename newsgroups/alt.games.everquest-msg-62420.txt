I don't think you are correct here.  I'll have to test it out tonight if I
remember.  I'm PRETTY sure that ALL creatures in SolB see through invis/camo
by default.  Now, in Sol *A* what you said is true for sure (for goblins
anyway).

They may see thru hide as well...I get the feeling that what makes rogue
invis so much better is the sneak component.  Hide lowers the chance of
being seen a little...sneak lowers it a hell of a lot more.  Add them
together and....
