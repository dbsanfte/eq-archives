Allow me to give my own experience.

I created a Wood Elf Warrior last night. I played for several hours and
found it to be very nice. People weren't all power gamers, nor was anyone an
extreme role-player. I had several light role-play sessions with different
people, nothing real exciting but better then the normal servers with all
you get is a blank stare.

There was one girl, Tabitha. After she announced she was ganna log for the
night (close down her little tailor shop) I then said /shout Say thanks to
Tabitha the kind hearted!

I got some pretty positive role-playing responses, she was a nice chick gave
out some free clothes...

A halfling was in Gfay, a halfling!! I shouted how queer a thing it was and
others seemed to be puzzled to see such a person there as well.

Yes, it was horribly over camped  with 100+ people there but around 12/1 AM
it got lighter and became better.

Remember I believe this is Role-Playing encouraged, not enforced.

Also give it a few days, let some of the people leave and see what's left.

Its still pretty new, also give it a week or so after it goes live in order
to have a fair time on it.

Enojoy.
