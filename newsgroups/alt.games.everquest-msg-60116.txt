	EQ has a lot more PvE content to work with.  More zones, more types of
mobs, etc.

	2.5 years of play, and there is still a lot to EQ I've haven't seen, some
of which I probably will never see.  (My guild isn't particularly interested
in Veeshan's Peak, for instance, and I won't be taking part in any of our
fights against Claws of Veeshan mobs for RP reasons.)
