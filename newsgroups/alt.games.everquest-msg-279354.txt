Its in SOEs best interests to have you buy the expansion; they want your 
money... so... if you feel like your getting handouts, gaurd your 
wallet. :p

Its a big demographic. You because you don't play much. Others because 
they play lots but very off peak, still others playing as often as 5 
times a week during peak may not be 'raid-eligible' due to the fact that 
they have to leave within moments of the baby waking up... who won't 
(and shouldn't) leave it screaming hungry in its filthy diaper for an 
hour or two until the raid winds down... and then still others who 
simply don't like 'being a cog in someone elses army' or 'having a 2nd 
job' which is how many raid guilds can feel.

Lots of people don't raid at all. And even more people don't raid often.
