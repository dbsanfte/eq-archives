No. Actually house cats like the big cats are straight predators.
Given to their own devices they can go "wild" and some do anyway. My
friend had a house cat who was normally quite passive inside but
outside it was "the hunter." It would regularly drag a dead baby rabit
or a bird or something it had killed up on to the porch after done
eating it. So really its more fitting that the vah shir is a rogue
instead of a monk, real cats kill with stealth in a rapid attack..
they don't jump out and buffet you with lots of blows and kicks.

Really no reason why kitties should be able to be monks anymore than
any other race and actually less. Think of it this way, cats use their
teeth and claws in combat while monks in eq use blunt weapons or their
fists but never anything stabbing.
