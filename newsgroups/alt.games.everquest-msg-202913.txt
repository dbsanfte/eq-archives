Agreed. However ... I wish a few things could be changed.

As much as enjoy being able to walk around dangerous areas with impudence,
it takes some of the realism out of the game being able to see a MoB a long
time before it can see me (I played on a Zek server for a little while, and
I enjoyed having to be aware of my surroundings i.e. what's that coming over
the hill ... it's an ogre ... oh feck, it's a player and he's red!).

And I hate MoBs agroing through walls. And their auto tracking thing -
wouldn't it be great to be able to dodge round a corner and hide somewhere,
hoping that big nasty giant wasn't going to be able to see (and squash!) me
when he lumbers round the corner!

I'm well aware of the technical issues here, but I can dream
