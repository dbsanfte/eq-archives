Then sir, you are doing something wrong.  My druid is pretty damned
easy to hunt with, particularly since they made snare and root stack.
And that's not even taking into account quadding.  And if you're
trying to hunt someplace that's a little to busy, just port off to the
other side of the planet and see what's up there.

And if you like grouping, you are still contribute plenty to a group.
DS, Heals, Nukes, ghetto crowd control, taxi service, and even a
puller if you're good.

I think you just need to look at the class closer.

Um, no.  75% cleric?  A druid with CH?  They why would you need a
cleric ever?  Druids can't handle healing of a MT on a raid level mob?
Well damn.  I guess they'll just have to be content to be able play
healer for the other 95% of the game.  And yes, I've had my druid play
healer before.  Last week as a matter of fact, on a level 55 warrior.
It wasn't horribly efficient, but it was very doable.

>Everyone despises druids because they are sorta easy from 15-29. 

They are more than 'sorta' easy.  'Sorta' easy doesn't qualify for a
class that can easily solo through all 60 levels of the game.

Ok, are you talking out of your ass, or do you have any actual
evidence to back such a, pardon the term, moronic statement?  Druids
are CAKE to level.  Particularly after level 14.  SoW and snare are a
devastating combination alone.  Add really nice DoT's and nudes and
there's very few blues that a druid can't take pre level 45.  And if
we can't kill it, we can almost certainly run away from it so we don't
die.  

I'm sorry.  Druids are fine just the way they are.
