    At least at 17, that's not the case.  Of course, with a scale that runs
to 40, that may not be "higher".

    But the trend is showing - it takes more attacks to kill things now
than it did at the beginning, and so you start to risk tiring out - so you
have to de-slot damage enhancements for endurance instead, which lowers the
dps a bit more - which means that fights are lasting longer.  But by level
18, you take a *lot* less damage in a lot of tanker builds so it's probably
ok for the fights to last longer from a survivability perspective; your
xp-per-minute probably just goes down a notch.
