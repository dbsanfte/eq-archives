The joys of public libraries.  :-)

Since two of you cited the Hughes book, I'll look it up.

A totally anecdotal piece of evidence to support my point: I swear on
a pretty regular basis  (Not every other word out of my mouth, but I
probably use the word "fuck" at least once a day in some context) and
the last time I was in a fight I was in 8th grade.  That was seventeen
years ago.

Sweet merciful crap.  1985 was seventeen years ago.  

A bit of information that might support you point: I believe I read
somewhere that the part of the brain that controls swearing is
separate from the part of the brain that controls normal speech.  I
need to look that up again.

I don't have a problem with people who simply dislike profanity.  I
just don't think people should or can EVER be 'hurt' by mere words.
The ideas behind those words might cause a situation that might hurt
somebody, but the words themselves are nothing.  I think that changing
the idea that people can, or should be offended by speech needs to be
changed.  Just the word fuck shouldn't be considered obscene, IMHO.

Or, using big words to look impressive.  I understood what you said,
it just seemed like a bit of intellectually dick waving.  That could
just be me though.

It's pompous and presumptuous to infer that much about a person simply
because you disagree with how the use language.
