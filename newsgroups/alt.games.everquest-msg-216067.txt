If you are using Outlook Express (frowned on my many newsgroup users) like I
do, simply go into <Tools>, <Accounts>, Click your newsgroup account,
<Properties>, <General> and change the email address on this, probably
similar if you are using a different reader.  Definately worth doing, I have
just closed my first email account leaving 3000+ junk mail messages mounting
up.

I assume antonious bayle has it's own website, and forum, so if you put a
post there saying you are new to the game and your characters name, you will
probably get various tells from high lvl characters willing to help you out.

good luck
cheers
