Probably not related, but what the heck...

I was getting a lot of those a few weeks ago on my win2k system.
Finally realized that it only happened when I had been using
Dreamweaver 4 before I tried starting EQ.  If I rebooted first, no
problems.

I patched Dreamweaer 4 to 4.01(?) early last week and have not had any
problems since....  dunno.  Maybe just 'voodoo tech' but I'm happy.
