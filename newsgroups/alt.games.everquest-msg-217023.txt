No, it doesn't suck when people say please.  It *does* suck when people put
the minimum possible effort into it.  If you want my help, you'll type all 6
letters, not just 2 and a tack-on.

Saying "plz" is, to many of us here, semantically equal to "I have to be
polite to get what I want, but nobody said I had to put any effort into it,
so minimum possible's good enough".  Nobody expects you to say "please"
while you're fighting for your life (or running for it), but when you're
asking for services, you've got the time to type those 3 extra characters.
