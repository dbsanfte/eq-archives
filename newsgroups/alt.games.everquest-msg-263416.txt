	hehe, I don't need to buy this game, I see now that I can 
experience it vicariously through Bob. =>  Keep telling us 
about it, you'll save us money.  =>
	In fact, if I were to play the game and go thorugh that 
area, I think I'd feel like I experienced it once already. 
But this way, I experienced it in a much more efficient 
manner, in a much shorter amount of time, and for free to 
boot.  =>  Takes up no space on my HDD, no having yet 
another cd adding even more clutter to my desk, and leaves 
more time for DAOC (which doesn't require a cd in the drive, 
and thus - no clutter).  hehe  Its great!  They shouldn't 
have lifted their NDA.  More Bob more!
	Its so much the case in fact, that now that I've read bob's 
post, I've lost my desire to go play daoc tonight, the urge 
having been satisified as if I had already done it, and now 
I think I'll go spend some time w/friends face to face 
instead w/teh remainder of my evening. =>
	The scary part of it all is, now that I've been playing 
daoc, to my horror, I understand some of the terms being 
thrown around in these threads that I had to figure out from 
context before, but that I now understand through experience 
and their actual definition like - LFG, mobs, aggro, 
pulling, etc...  Does that make me even more of a nerd? 
Have I gained 10 points in nerdness?  Am I starting to spec 
away from computer geek and towards nerd?  Or have I merely 
dinged and those points only count if I 'train' and actually 
use those 10 points by spending them in the nerd line? 
Perhaps I can spend them on musician instead?  Or dork? 
Nah, I'd need way more than 10 points to go up a level in 
dork.
