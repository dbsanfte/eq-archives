DA has an 18 second duration.  To get TO HS you need to cross the path of dozens
of HT scorpiki, including 6 or so at the entrance glob itself.  So, to do this you
really want invis to get to the entrance room, and then hope DA goes off fast
enough to prevent the Scorpiki HTs landing before you zone in.

For that matter, I've had it suggested that the DA timer continues to run while
you are zoning.  Never tried it myself, but if this is true, a slow zoner is going
to be in some trouble, with his DA already worn off by the time he arrives, or
else arriving without DA on and trying to cast it after arrival but before taking
the HTs.

Fun either way, eh?
