Had me confused for a moment there. You replied to my post with a top-
posted reply to someone else's. 

HINT: Represent yourself in a manner depicting some level of experience 
in the medium you are utilizing, following well-established protocol, if 
you want to be given any semblance of credibility.

QUESTION: If they "fell for" the other guide, what reason in the world 
would they have to "fall for" yours, the inability to avoid getting bent 
over?

POINT OF FACT: Cabbaging onto someone else's success ("SOE & Everquest") 
by providing a ridiculously inferior version the same product or service 
already abundantly available and highly accessible (um, see all the EQ 
websites on the internet) in an attempt to line your own pockets will 
invariably be looked upon with contempt and disdain. Likely, you will be 
viewed as just another self-important uber-l337 d00d trying to make a 
quick buck. You're the equivalent of a pencil salesman at a PDA 
convention.
