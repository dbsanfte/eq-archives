I don't really see how it could really be that much of a problem they way 
they were doing it. 

They placed you on a random low level mob in a random zone and you couldn't 
communicate with anyone, or zone for that matter.

I was a rat in qeynos I think, and a flame gob in lavastorm. But I don't 
believe I did it on test, seems like it was available on normal servers (or 
maybe just pvp) for a very small period of time and they took out the 
button on the char select screen, but you could still click in the same 
place and get in for a while.
