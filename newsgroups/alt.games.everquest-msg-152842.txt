Not real sure here but I have read on a lot of boards people saying junk any GF
MX card. Funny, I had one till recently, running XP Home and EQ ran fine. Now I
upgraded to a GF 4 Ti 4400 for the upcoming games but I never had a problem
running anything I wanted to install. Most definitely, check for new drivers.
Always.
