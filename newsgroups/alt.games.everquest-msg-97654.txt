I seem to recall seeing a plain moon, a  crescent moon, and a ringed
planet in the sky in PoA - I have a screenshot of the regular and the
crescent moon together in the sky, and the crescent looks *nothing*
like the ringed gas planet. I believe the crescent is Luclin, the
plain moon Drinal, and the gas planet is something further out in the
bizarre Norrathian solar system.
