See my reply to Richard Lawsonn for my suggestion. I strongly recommend that
you uninstall your existing Classic installation, delete all of the folders
and simply install the Gold edition fresh on your system. Don't worry about
your character or your account, both will continue to exist on the Sony
servers and neither reside on your local machine. For your information, I
stopped playing EverQuest for a couple of years and completely wiped
everything from my hard disk many times. When I ultimately returned I bought
the Gold edition and installed everything fresh and both my account and all
my characters were fine and intact. What does reside on your machine is
incidental configuration information that will be easy enough to
re-configure once you're logged in to your chacter with the Gold edition.
Some will argue that a better approach is to save some of your existing
configuration files and move them over to the new installation. You can do
that, but the approach II'm suggesting I consider slightly safer in that it
helps you avoid some of the problems that arise out of multiple directories
and conflicting versions of Classic files, etc. It's worth it to me to
reconfigure from scratch in order to avoid these potential conflicts.

When it comes time to enter your registration, enter the single CD key that
comes with your Gold edition and choose to upgrade your existing account.
You'll be in business with your existing character and a clean fresh
install.

Have fun!

Bob
