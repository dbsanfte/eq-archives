Absolutely agree.  But a big thumbs-down to Sony for taking over a year to
fix this bug.  During that time KEI had become such a staple for low-level
characters that fixing this bug *feels* like a nerf.  If only they'd fixed
this right away, like they should have, then the playerbase would not be
feeling the pain it is now.

Well, as a counter-argument... as a paladin leveling up with KEI, I managed
my mana just fine.  I probably used 40 mana per fight give or take root
being resisted / breaking.  For me, KEI helped speed up my downtime -
y'know, healing and buffing myself, then medding and recovering mana, that
stuff.  Sitting and staring at the walls is no one's idea of fun; KEI
reduced this tremendously.

You gotta find a better argument than "so what".  =)  Waiting doing nothing
for five minutes is a big deal, especially when you consider that you spend
much more time medding than fighting.  This shouldn't be hard to
understand - few soloers enjoy downtime at all.

I think a more effective argument against soloing is that Sony intends for
Everquest to be played by groups.  If you don't want downtime, go find a
group!  If you want to solo as a low-level character, the price is downtime.

This argument is unstructured and difficult to follow and seems to address
larger issues than KEI.

I am a thirtysomething male with plenty of patience who still doesn't enjoy
downtime and doesn't necessarily enjoy leveling slowly.  That doesn't mean
getting XP as fast as I can is my primary goal - I've done my share of
exploring with my Pally alt, including a foray into Dulak that was a
complete disaster.  =)  Sometimes I like doing silly things, but when I
actually settle down and do the XP grind, I find no great intrinsic value to
levling up more slowly.

My only other argument - capital letters, neh?  My 32-year-old sister with a
doctorate in Planetary Sciences sends me emails without capital letters -
drives me bonkers.  =)
