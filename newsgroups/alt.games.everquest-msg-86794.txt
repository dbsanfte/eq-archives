>Maybe you're over fishing the hole.

I didn't know that they might be counting the fish!  Besides I don't see lots
of angler in the world of EQ, you know.  In real life one would be looking for
a school of fish.  If you find the school you will be pulling fish out as soon
as you cast.  But in EQ it does seem to help to move casting location after
catching multiple fish in a row.  Other thing is to concentrate when fishing. 
In the past I use to play with direction finding ability during fishing to get
that skill up.  It seems now if I try multi tasking like that, I loose the
fish!   I caught more fish by just fishing lately.
