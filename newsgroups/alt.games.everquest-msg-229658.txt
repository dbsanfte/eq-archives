My guess would be that recipies will be flaggable as to whether or not they
show up in the list.  If they are not flagged, you'll have to do them the
old way.  I'd expect them to flag all the well-known recipies, not flag the
undiscovered ones, and when a new expansion introduces new recipie books,
leave them unflagged for a few weeks, then flag them.
