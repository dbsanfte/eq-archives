Of course I do, I see no reason to be dishonest.  I'm a pretty blunt
person.

Speaking of immature fun....

Inasmuch as one can "win" or "lose" a debate, it is necessary to
actually defend one's points... something you failed to do.  While a
single example can be effectively used to make a point, it fails to
prove the general case.  Yet, other than your one concrete example,
you mounted no defence whatsoever to your "special rights" claims.
You have not denied this, I notice.

If you approached this an a debate in philosophy, however, there need
not be a loser.  I would consider myself a winner on that score in
that I achieved my gaol-- adding to my previous observations of those
who falsely believe that anti-discrimination laws are "special rights"
laws, and giving me some insight as to why.   Thanks for making it
easy.
