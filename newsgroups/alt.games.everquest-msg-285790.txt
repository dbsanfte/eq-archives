Don't know of any site.

Once you understand what counters are being applied, and know what kind of
counters and how many a spell removes, you can work out it though.

Tash applies poison counters, so you need cure poison spells to remove it
etc.

Malo doesn't apply any counters, so you need the radiant cure line or
similar effects to remove it (or dispell magic)
