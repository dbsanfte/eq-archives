Far from it I'd say. EQ still has a massive amount of subscribers. The only
potential problem that I tend to see is that with most people now having
high level characters, the majority of the low levels tend to be well
equipped alts soloing or being powerlevelled so the grouping experience at
low level is relatively uncommon compared to how it used to be. The newbie
zones I see tend to be very quiet these days compared to a couple of years
back. Places like Crushbone, Paludal Caverns etc seem to be the preferred
levelling path for a number of people so your mileage may vary there.

At moderate to high levels it seems to be progressively easier and easier to
find groups though in my experience. I started playing post Velious, left
for 11 months and came back about 3 or 4 months ago to give you an idea of
where I'm getting my comparisons from anyway. Others may have different
takes on it. I guess you haven't got a lot to lose by activating your
account for a month or two and checking it out. Hope this is of some use!
