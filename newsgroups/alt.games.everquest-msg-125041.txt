haha.. ouch.

just a question...   when your invited to pickup groups (be it juggs, VS,
king in Sebilis) can you honestly say loot drops there doesn't influence
your decision ONE SINGLE BIT?
And it doesn't influence a SINGLE member of your group?

See, you don't even need to join an uber guild, to be surrounded by assholes
wanting "phat lewt" :)

Loot is a major part of the game... I mean I bet your cleric doesn't run
around naked, with zero cash in the bank does he?
