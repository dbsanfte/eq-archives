Sit at the South Gate in Freeport sometime.
/shout Need a bind at South Gate
/shout Need a SoW for CR at South Gate
/shout Need Breeze or Clarity at South Gate

ad nauseum.

As far as it being those who will give free buffs - I don't think so. My 30
Ranger & my 21 Druid have both given out free buffs ( drive by buffings )
especially SoW & Skin like Rock. But I rarely get tells asking for buffs.
And since I try to stay away from cities unless needed I rarely get binding
requests. I really think it those same kids who want to PL to level 50 in 2
weeks. They think if they ask - even semi nicely - the DESERVE to get what
they ask for.
Damn PS players
