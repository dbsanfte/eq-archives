Well thats an improvement, and its what I'd thought before looking it up.

Armed with a printout list of shaman and mage spells and components, I 
did a little looking around in the bazaar.  Spells where there were 
several copies in the bazaar tended to have components for sale for 
about as much as the spells themselves; given that there's a failure 
rate, this wouldn't be a good deal.  But the rarer spells I looked at, 
where there was only one or two copies of the spell for sale, were going 
for about half again what the components were going for.

Funny thing to me is, this still implies one of three things is happening.

1) components drop off mobs that aren't commonly farmed.  This is what 
makes me question Sean's statement that they drop off 50+ mobs.  People 
kill 50+ mobs in enourmous quantities for exp

2) people are all great at finding prices on every single little piece 
of junk they loot, so they can tell instantly that a Yaeth's 50 left is 
worth 100 times what a Yaeths 50 right is worth

3) people who don't care about looking all this up don't bother looting 
the junk, or sell it to vendors, so only the people who -do- care are 
selling, which is why they seem to know the prices

4) people are actively looking for the valuable components in the 
bazaar, and when they do show up underpriced, they buy em up and either 
reprice up where the market is, or make the spells and sell them for 
even more profit.

Or some combination of the above.

3) would indicate my plan of vendor mining might be a very profitable 
one.  1), on the other hand, would indicate that the vendors won't have 
a thing, because anyone killing the few mobs who drop the components is 
doing so specifically for those drops, and wouldn't be so silly as to 
vendor them.
