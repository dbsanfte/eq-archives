You are both missing the point here, plat sellers money also comes from
highly used macro sploits and bugs, generating many times the plat they
could via farming and bazaaring.

So no they aren't "legit" in any sense of the word.. and talking about what
they do and don't kill.. in most cases it has nothing to do with PA /shrug

Btw the "want a mob, beat them to it" argument is pretty weak.  There is a
PoP flag progression mob, killable in 30 minutes by 2 people, that can bring
a guilds flag progression to a crashing halt.  So is it tough shit that a
guild can't log on, raid and kill this mob faster than 2 people can casually
run in?

In a general "random zone trash mob" sense.. sure, whoever gets there first.
But I don't really think rat_01 is the source of plat sellers income, do
you?
