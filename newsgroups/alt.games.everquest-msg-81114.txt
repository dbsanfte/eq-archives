Hi...I would recommend you try a shaman (pretty sure you can play ogre
shaman--i've never played evil characters myself).  That way you can buff
him with great spells to enhance his warrior performance, you can heal him
(shamans get heal spells), etc.  Most tanks (slang for warriors) beg for
shamans in the group because of the benefits they can offer.  You might try
the web site castersrealm to see explanations of the spells (plus great
guides for creating characters well the first time)...hope this helps....
