once i met a fella who played day and night, and as if that weren't enough,
he had a son and wife who played too

he would keep their accounts logged on so our group would get free lvl 60
enc and clr buffs

it got us to talking, and he told a very very sad story about a terrible
accident he was in


he was crippled


he said that eq made him feel like he could walk again


since then i have made a point to initiate conversations in long-term
(several hour) groups (wherever people are comfortable chatting), just to
see why other people play eq, when it was obvious they were not a "d00d i
pwn joo, i ubah lvl 60" type

i'd like to thank you for your assumptions and your blindness to the tiny
parry of "no offense intended" (but i'm being sarcastic toward you now,
because if no one else respects you, i certianly won't)

everyone is offended by something, everyone laughs at something, so just try
to find a better way to sustain your trolling than assuming one can't joke
about something that one also takes seriously

i am an asshole: i fed the troll !
