Welcome, Kanliegh! I hail from the Northern climes, meself, it's good to see
you and that good Barbarian stock. Yes, people are quite friendly in our
little community and I think you'll find a very supportive environment for
your new adventures. The lingua franca of Firiona Vie is Elvish, so find
yourself a pointy-eared friend willing to sit down and teach you that
strange tongue and join the fun.
