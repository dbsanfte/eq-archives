My hotkey just has:

Attack off
Sense Traps
Hide

Sense traps is my current skill I am building. If I want BS I hit "0"
where my backstab is. If I wan't attack I hit "Q" where my atack is
mapped to. I control when I reattack or BS. Sometimes I hide and
poison if I need to gain aggro.

99 percent of the time I don't want any aggro. I die fast. I want
aggro when my Wizard friend is evacing or my Chanter friend is trying
to mez with a mob on them. I can get aggro faster with poison than I
can with seven seconds of attacks.
