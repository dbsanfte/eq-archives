The more than one pet thing is a POP ability.

What I have done so far:
General - need 6 to go to next level:
Run 1-3
Regen 1-3

Archetype - need 12 to go next level:
Spell Casting Mastery 1-3 (which decreases mana cost for every spells)

Class:
working on Pet Discipline, which means my pet will not attack unless 
ordered to. This is incredibly useful on raids.

Planning to work on:
Dire Charm - which allows me to charm an NPC (as long as it's undead and 
a certain level) and keep him charmed until I invis, die, or leave the zone.

Lifeburn - converts all of my hitpoints into damage cast on the enemy, 
and has a lifetap component that will give me some health back (assuming 
that I don't get hit before the next tick).

Conjure Corpse - a componentless conjure corpse- Ideal for summoning 
myself, and then I can summon the raid with the coffins stored on my 
corpse... so I don't need to run and buy one.

Natural Durability - to increase my hit points, as hit points ARE mana 
to a necro.

Innate Stamina - to raise Stamina and therefore hitpoints.

POP AAs:
Increase Int limit
Feigned Minion - lets the pet feign death.
Suspended Minion - tuck the pet in stasis for a moment, so you can charm 
another NPC to make a pet.
Wake the Dead - use an NPC or PC's corpse, revitalize it, and use THAT 
as a pet. Why yes, you can have Sontalak's corpse as your pet for as 
long as the spell lasts.
Not sure of the name for the one skill that raises lots of little pets.

And some day, when I have all of these AAs, I'll go for GMing all the 
tradeskills. But I'm weird like that.
