LOL!  I love this.

The very first time I posted in this group, It was something to do with
patch day, and how I thought it sucked, I got flamed to hell LOL. Since then
I have sat back, participated infrequently and waited for someone to make a
comment I could jump on.

Well, you made the comment Lance, and no, I didn't take it seriously.  I
don't take a great deal seriously, except for alcohol, of course! Very
serious about that, no one messes with my drink! What happened was I have
turned into newsgroup dork, waiting for my pathetic chance to have a go at
someone I have never met before, just like a lot of other people here do.

Well no more I say!  I shall be myself, and If noone likes it, tough shit.

So as from this line down, consider this to be my reply to your original
posting.

Nah, won't have been bloody euro's, it'll have been them inbred, no good
yanks! (throw away comment, of course)
