Note:  it does NOT always cost a character nothing to cast a buff. 
Attend me:

If I cast HoV on someone who has come asking (or begging) for it, it
costs me 2 peridots (about 23 plat) and about 56% of my mana bar.  The
mana, yes, I will regenerate it (though it DOES take a long time, even
with AotZ and a horse, if I go otherwise manabuff-less) but the
peridots are a serious cost over time.

As I am not the stereotypical cleric who hoards gems in his groups and
charges for rezzes and buffs (not even HoV), I am almost always broke.
 I do not ask for donations when buffing (though I will sometimes take
a donation if it's offered); however, with a spell that costs me as
much as HoV does, I would not think less of any cleric who does so -
nor of anyone who casts a buff/spell requiring an expensive reagent
(such as a necro summon for a high-level character).
