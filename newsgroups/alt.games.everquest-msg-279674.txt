I don't think self-twinking should be allowed, dependng on how the plat is 
gotten. Farming for money would not be allowed. However, should a higher 
character drop a nice piece of equipment on you and you sell it, that 
should be allowed. In City of Heroes, I quite freqently do drive-by gifting 
to lower level heroes.

Receiving drive-bys are part of what makes a MMORPG great. Begging for 
buffs would be, IMO, out of the question. Using one that happens to be 
dropped on you out of the goodness of someone's heart is always allowed. 
Hell, you ceould even pay someone to buff your team for you, as long as you 
get the plat by "legit" means.
