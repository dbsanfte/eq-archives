Even before the current incarnation of the UI, there was a stage that
went in shortly after Velious that didn't require bouncing back to
640x480 for the inventory. It did, unfortunately, still require it for
opening the spellbook.

Nope, shortly after SoL. It was meant to go in with SoL, but wasn't
ready in time. It was a "global" upgrade, too, meaning you didn't need
an expansion for it.
