Anyone know how the drop rates for the keys has been changed?
I've spent the last week off and on in Befallen trying to get the keys.
I've timed the spawn to about 19 minutes to 19 minutes 43 seconds. I spent
an entire evening killing the Dark Follower in his room and not once key. I
mean, it would be one thing if I was getting xp, but for a l25 pally, forget
it.
From everything I have heard, it used to drop pretty commonly, now pffft.
Is this yet another method Verant is trying to get people to group together?
Make you find someone with a key?
Thanks in advance.
