As a fellow wood-elf ranger, I would suggest collecting Crushbone belts and
handing them in to Canloe Nusback in the warriors guild in Kaladim. But if
it is Freeport faction you are after then keep trying with the Deathfist
belt quest. I don't know why it doesn't work for you. I did the quest once a
long time ago and it worked. Maybe you need better faction with the warriors
guild before they will reward you.

Did you buy these belts or kill Deathfist orcs to get them?
