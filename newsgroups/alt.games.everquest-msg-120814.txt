I have had the same in Dreadlands.  But being a 50+ Ranger that Bow Hunts,
not kites mind you, A 60 monk couldn't break my agro, and he did try.

It was my Drolvarg Rager, I pulled it, ensnared it, Dotted the piss out of
it and Pin cushioned it.  Then he had the nerve to be mad at me because it
ignored him, even when rooted.   hehe.
