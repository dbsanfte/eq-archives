What few farmers exist will not be stopped by a TLC. In fact, TLC does not stop
any farming what so ever. The existance of farmers is soly because of
in-appropiate loot on mobs. We all talk about this concept of "appropriate level
players killing appropiate level mobs". That is a falacy. If the loot on a mob is
not appropriate for that level, then the mob that drops it is not appropriate
level for that player. What needs to be done to stop farming is place items are
the correct level of mob. Past history shows that this is a difficult thing to
achieve. Rune Bone Fork, Fish Bone Earring, Idol of Thorn, Gator sleeves and legs
are example of both old and new items that clearly show that in-appropriate loot
is going to be placed on in-approprate mobs. TLC will not stop the farming of
these items by high levels.

Yet, are we not trying to saw that a low level has the RIGHT to camp whatever
loot they want with this justification of the TLC? I mean, that is exactly what
we are stating. "Mr. High_level, you are not allowed to camp a loot because we
deam this loot belonging to Mr. Low_level that is why we are placing the TLC on
this zone." What is the difference? Furthermore, we are stating that Mr.
High_level has to be forced to buy the medallion from Mr Low_level. How is that
any different from the current case that Mr. Low_level has to buy it from Mr.
High_level?

In fact, I believe the second way would be better (ie. low_level buying from
high_level) because the price would be cheaper. The value of items are based on
the supply of the items. Lower the supply and you increase the cost. Increase the
difficulty to obtain the items, you decrease the supply and thereby increase the
cost. Currently, you can get a thing like the Rune Bone Fork for about 400pp.
Make something like that only be obtained by groups of lower levels, the value
will sky rocket to 10kpp. And guilds will go into the area and farm the items
with twinks. That means your newbies will still not be able to camp that item but
now will also not be able to buy the item.
