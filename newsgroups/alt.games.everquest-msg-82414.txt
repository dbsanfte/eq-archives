I beg to differ.  I have never died going between FV and LOIO (came 
close a few times due to being "snared" by lag), even when I had neither 
SOW nor Invis/Camo.  The Warrens on the other hand have proved quite 
lethal to a SOW'd L17 Ranger when camo dropped without warning.  Once 
you've gotten a feel for the pathing between FV and LOIO you can make 
the trip just by excercising reasonable care, even without SOW.  The 
mobs for the last third of the trip thru the Warrens are not similarly 
avoidable.  I can solo LOIO for decent xp with most any L17+ char (I've 
done it with several).  The Warrens and Stonebrunt require me to bring a 
group, and since none of my characters has a "regular" group they are 
useless to me, as they appear to be to very nearly the entire EQ player 
population.
