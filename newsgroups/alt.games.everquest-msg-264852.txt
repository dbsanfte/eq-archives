Hello,
     Was thinking about starting this quest, but I have read multiple
posts that say the Saquine Tome no longer drops. Most of the items can
be bought in the Bazaar, but my guild raids most of these places on a
regular basis. That does not include CT however. I saw the thread that
CT might have reverted on test, but not sure if this book dropped
before the revamp.
     Does this book still drop? Can it be done with a single group, or
does it require more? If CT is revamped would the book still drop? I
guess I'm asking if its worth trying this quest.

Ken
