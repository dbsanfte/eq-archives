....I've been thinking about buying Everquest.  Though I know graphics on it
are somewhat "aged" people STILL to this day rave about how fun it is.  A
game that has been out for 2 years and STILL has millions of people raving
kind of has me sold.  I can honestly say that I was REALLY into DAoC,
Dungeon Siege, and Diablo II for a while but I never have even played
Everquest.  I think now is the time because my computer isn't exactly a
speed demon (Athlon 850MHz, 256MB PC133, GeForce2 64MB) and I kind of want a
game with great gameplay to tide me over until I build my new computer in
January.  By then I'll be ready for games like SWG, EQ2, and AC2.  Thanks!

Peace,
Kyle
