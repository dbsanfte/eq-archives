Hm. If you are talking about Jeffrey Katzenberg, he wasn't headhunted, 
he *funded* DreamWorks, alongside Spielberg and David Geffen (in fact, 
he is the "K" in DreamWorks SKG). I met him several times before and 
during the development of The Prince of Egypt and The Road to El Dorado, 
as he was much more involved in the day-to-day of the productions than 
the other two.
