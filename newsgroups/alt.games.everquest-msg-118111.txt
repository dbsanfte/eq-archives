I would have assumed Bulthar skin, with them being enemies and all that. 
Anyway, I did end up buying one for 400pp (200, after selling the

Necropotence and a white horse instead. Are there any Druid-useable 
scythes?

as the ES Vambraces are otherwise. :)

Strange... I could have sworn that AC is calculated automatically, but then 
again, I may be wrong, I never look at my AC.
