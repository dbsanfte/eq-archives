    If you aren't using Evasive on those low DI mobs I'd be surprised. And
your class isn't the only one that gets the short end of the stick when it
comes to /discs. Ever seen an SK do anything other than the unholy aura one?

    Bah. I'll trade you the cleric Class-level skills for the Warrior
class-level skills. We both get one useful one (AoE Taunt vs. MGB), and a
whole bunch of situational trash. The good stuff is in Archetype skills,
where warriors should have at least 36 points spent. Once I get past the
first 12 points for SCM, the remaining skills start looking a little weak
(although I'm cheerfully trying to max ND!)
