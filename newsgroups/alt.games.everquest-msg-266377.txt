The money part seems an unneccasary step, why not just put the powder 
right on the box?  Put the box inside a paper bag so innocent bystanders 
don't end up touching it.

I love the powder to hands to time card angle, though, that answers 
Annie's question regarding my UV idea, of how she's supposed to go thru 
the whole company checking hands with a UV light.

Question, though, where can she get this UV powder?
