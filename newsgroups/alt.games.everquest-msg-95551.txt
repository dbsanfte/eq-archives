I don't know about that. Remember, he conned them and he was glaring,
not scowling. If you move fast, that's not an automatic attack in the
first moment. He said he "ran past the guards". Might have just gotten
lucky on the first go. As so swimming past the other NPC, might have
been outside aggro range, or again, dashed by too fast. Spent his whole
early career in the FP area, so had no idea if he was KOS or not before
this encounter. If he worships Rallos Zek, I think Religion may be the
issue here.
