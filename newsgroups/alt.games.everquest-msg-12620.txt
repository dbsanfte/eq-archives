you dont just drop support for a popular product (i never said it was a
spectacular product ;)

it falls within specs on the box, and if they're selling the game without
stating what chipsets arent supported, they're screwing over alot of
potential customers

they supported it last Tuesday, so all of sudden they wont support it from
Wednesday on?
