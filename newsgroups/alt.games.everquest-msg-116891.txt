Are you serious?  Summoned stuff doesn't despawn in tradeskill containers?
As a monk with Dimensional Packets given to me by a mage friend, that would
be AMAZINGLY helpful.  Wouldn't leave anything in them, but just have them
there so I could actually loot stuff.  I had two of them today fighting and
made around 70pp as a 23 Monk in just a few hours.  If I could have them all
the time, god that would be helpful.  I'm gonna try this out.  Thanks for
the suggestion.
