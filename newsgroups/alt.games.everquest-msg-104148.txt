Lol....one day my druid was on the shore of the lake in loio passing
the time while mana regenned (im genning) and someone in OOC said they
wanted to test a theory. Then he said "What is the airspeed velocity
of an unladen swallow?" So i replied "What do you mean? African or
European swallow?" All he said was "Theory proven." Seems a lot of
people like british comedy. I grew up with it on sunday nights on
public television.
