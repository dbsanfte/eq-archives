By default, if they do nothing else but those quests, yes. Personally, I've 
always had different equipment dropped from mobs that was superior to any of 
my AQ'd items. In fact, several of my AQ'd items were never attuned because 
I had better already and I just sold them. EQ2 provides the ability to get 
what you need via standard quests, but also the option to differentiate 
yourself with exotic drops off challenging mobs, if you prefer. Not as much 
as any of us would like, probably, but it's there and the most recent patch 
indicates that more is coming all the time. Last night we found several very 
interesting new set pieces off nightbloods in EL. A pair of boots with +11 
WIS, for example (contrast this to Dwarven Working Boots and Legendary 
Journeyman Boots, neither of which have WIS).
