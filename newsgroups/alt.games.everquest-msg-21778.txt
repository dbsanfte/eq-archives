Well now, that isn't *too* bad.  I was thinking all *eight* were just 
going to have to keep being swapped...

Hum and here the first thing someone told me was "Hotkey your spells, it 
makes it faster."  Casting the wrong spell, that's *because* of the 
hotkey thing - I forget I've changed a spell for something else, I hit 
the hotkey I'm used to hitting, and - oops.  Minor healing.  No, that 
wasn't what I meant to do, not at all...
