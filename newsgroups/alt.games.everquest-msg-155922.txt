}I have a clock. I forget to look at it.  I suppose I could go out and
}buy myself a new alarm clock, but seeing as I already have to go out
}and buy a new one for my bedroom tomorrow, and I'm barely eking out
}enough to pay for EQ atm (and hey, without EQ, I wouldn't need a
}reminder ;p) and have an over the limit credit card bill and a
}mother's birthday gift to buy still... *shrug* not complaining, just
}pointing out why that won't be happening.  Besides, I didn't whine at
}them to put an alarm in, never even thought about an alarm right in EQ
}itself.  I never would have thought of it, but since it's in there,
}why the heck not do it some useful way?

Hmm, you know... Now that I think about it, I believe I did ask for an 
alarm feature once.  About a year and a half ago.  I can't believe how 
annoyingly they impemented it though.  Where's the freakin' snooze button?
