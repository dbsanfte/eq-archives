Fair enough...you may be right in that regard, although I have faith in 
our legal system to also pull some pretty weird shit.  

Two thoughts though:

1) If it is rampantly unconstitutional, why should it even be passed in 
the first place?  Is it so wrong to want to stop it before it is passed?

2) The S-DMCA covers a lot more than just the oft-mentioned-here 
firewall example.  For example, the S-DMCA gives them the right to say 
what you can and cannot connect to your cable television line.  It gives 
them full authorization to say "we only allow Sony brand televisions to 
be used with our cable lines".  If the DMCA can be, and has been, used 
to drive out competition along these lines, what stops the S-DMCA from 
being used in this fashion as well?

If there is one thing you can trust in our legal system, it is this:  If 
a law _can_ be interpreted in one way, it _will_ be.  If there is any 
ambiguity, it _will_ be exploited.  This has been proven time and time 
again in our legal system.

I need to make this clear...the criminalization of VPN, firewalls, 
encryption development, etc. is more than "remotely true".  I've begun 
to read enough information all over the Internet that confirms that this 
is not alarmism of a small group.  

By the letter of this law, these things ARE NOW ILLEGAL in certain 
states.  Period.  The spirit of the law may be another matter, but we 
are no longer talking about "some people's interpretations".  If you 
don't think it will hold up in court, that's one thing, but there is no 
longer any reason to doubt what the law can cover.   

I'm sorry I'm getting prickly, but all the comments of "if this is 
true" and "supposedly broad language" are starting to frustrate me.  
I've been treading softly because I like to keep an open mind (and maybe 
those comments were just the words of other soft-treaders), but I'm 95% 
sure of the validity of the interpretation.  In a newsgroup where folks 
will start to flame when they are only 25% sure, I think that's enough 
to stand behind.
