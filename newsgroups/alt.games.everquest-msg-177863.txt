Oh yeah. I love focus effects. I don't know how I survived without them. I'm
'wasting' perfectly good stat slots for items that do nothing but give me
focus effects (I desperatly want a Crystalline Torque, but they are sooo
expensive).

rude awakening that...

I usually quit at that point.

Gratz on the nice loot btw...

btw: neat trick if you know how to type: esdf for movement keeps your
fingers on the home keys.
let me see... z for autoattack, w to sit down, v for crouch...
anyway.

Once I woke up to see congratulations of a good job of crowd control..
apparently what happened was this:

4 pull, charm 1, assist it on MT, dazzle 2 (one resists and bashes me a
bit), tash the two dazzled ones, put my slow for the shaman to overwrite
later (didn't have him trained to slow my mezzed stuff yet), root with my
long lasting root x2, dazzle x2...
I fall asleep.
Fight ends, tank breaks first dazzle, root breaks due to DD proc on first
swing, mob charges me, hits my berserker's str Damage absorb, my pet and the
tank get it taunted off of me.
shaman slows the still dazzled mob by mistake
Dazzle wears off, I'm standing close enough to get hit, I apparently get
knocked back out of melee range just as my rune drops (I took one hit for
like 15 points).
second mob drops, tank and pet get on next one.
he goes down, tank calls for charm break, charm breaks on it's own, he
taunts my former pet off me, group kills it.

I wake up.
Reclaritied, rehasted, said my farewells, and gated.


Anyway, please keep it up, love to see these glimpses into the life of the
uber. Even the Uber's that fall asleep at the wheel.
