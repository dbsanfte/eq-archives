Much higher would be good, it's expensive to fail at FP armor.  Trivial
levels for FP armor are between 182 and 242, so a good idea would be to max
out your smithing on banded first.  The banded cloak will take you up to
175.  After that you can try Ornate Chain, but I'm not sure if that is
really much if any cheaper to do than FP.
