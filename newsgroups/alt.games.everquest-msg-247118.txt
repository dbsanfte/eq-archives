/sigh

Its *NOT* I repeat *NOT* the piece of Sony code that is the problem.

With IE and ActiveX enabled, it is possible for a malicious site (*NOT* 
Sony) to trigger it something to be downloaded and installed...

With a regular program, you have to download them. There is no risk of 
FireFox downloading and installing software on your PC. With IE and 
ActiveX there is.

*IF* you only go to the sony website, and only download their activeX 
component and never use IE again you'll be fine. But *if* you've secured 
your IE browser ... you have to unsecure it to apply for the beta... 
while its unsecured it is at risk... if you surf elsewhere... or if you 
forget to resecure it immediately after you apply it... etc etc etc.
