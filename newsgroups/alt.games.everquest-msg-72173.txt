  The FBI NIPC recommends measures beyond just patching your system
with Windows Update.  They seem to think that even patched, there is
some sort of security threat unless you turn off UPnP.  I have to
wonder if that's really true, or if they're just trying to appear
"hard, tough and vigilant" given the heightened sensitivity the media
recently has had towards security issues of all varieties.

  Windows Me supports the feature that is supposedly vulnerable
(Universal Plug and Play) but is not turned on by default.  Windows XP
supports the feature and has it on by default.  So I get the
impression that this security flaw alone is no reason to avoid XP,
since either you're using it already with an earlier version of
Windows and are still "vulnerable", or you could upgrade to XP and
turn it off and not lose any functionality that you had with Windows
Me/98.
