Alas no. But the good news is that this doesn't represent a failing of 
the maxim, but rather is the result that in the finer details things get 
  really complicated, and its impossible to see the big picture.

Its easy to see and agree that random murder is wrong with this maxim.

Its much harder to decide whether a child born with serious defects that 
might be rectified with risky and expensive procedures with a minimal 
chance of success is worth doing, especially when the family is very 
poor and will be unable to cope with a handicapped child well anyways, 
and in the next room is another baby who needs a kidney and won't last 
the night... unless the first child is allowed to die... and ... so on.

Its much harder to formulate a maxim that applies well to such a fine 
case. That doesn't mean their isn't a best answer... but its inevitable 
that people will balance the various agreed upon maxims (right to life, 
etc) slightly differently (due to differences in perceived definitions, 
perceived circumstances, etc... necessarily coming up with different 
results.

This doesn't make the axioms useless. But its just as knowing the laws 
of physics doesn't allow us to predict the weather very well. Its too 
complicated and subtle to make very specific predictions terribly far 
into the future.

"Economics are responsible for a good deal more of the trade than 
anything else,"

So the women are choosing prostitution because they're desperate to make 
ends meet? I call that an unfortunate circumstance. If they were 
choosing it because they love making it with random strangers not of 
their choosing, or they derived some sort of satisfaction in a job well 
done... then maybe... but "I'm doing it because I'm desperate for cash" 
is just slavery with its face washed in capitalism.

We all need to 'work'; we're all a slave to the mighty dollar. But its 
tragic when we're driven into jobs we despise and loathe, that rob of us 
of our dignity.

Its really no different than patronizing a sweatshop... they're their 
because its the 'best pay in town'. That doesn't make it right.

To apply the axiom I don't want my daughter to be in a position where 
she feels compelled to prostitute herself to make ends meet. Thus I do 
not want prostitution to be on the table as an approved of option.

And here is a great example of perceived definitions. The prostitutes 
I've encountered ply their trade in front of one of my clients labs, due 
to the part of town its in. These women are bruised, beaten, junkies who 
are escorted to their corners by their pimps and left to fend for 
themselves. They have the plastered on smile of someone who's high, 
their barely conscious of what they're revealing, and when nature calls 
they do it in the street.

These women will likely die of an overdose or worse, and will never see 
the inside of a college. Naturally that's going to draw me to a 
different conclusion when we talk about 'prostitutes'.

What exactly has he considered? That using women driven to ply their 
bodies 'because they are broke' amounts to real consent?

One can be negligent in assessing the situation. That is a moral fault 
in itself.
