Rogues do more damage in a typical fight than any other class.  More
than warriors.  More than monks.  More than druids or necros or shaman
with their DOTs and or pets.  More than wizards nuking (wizards can do
more damage over 30 seconds to a minute...but any fight that lasts
longer, and the rogue will do more, without causing downtime).

Rogues can move if they are hiding and sneaking.  No one else can move
while hidden.  Rogues get a success/failure message when they try to
hide and sneak.  No one else does.  I believe rogues also have higher
skill caps in one or both of these than anyone else.

Why is this so good?  Because rogue hide is the best invisibility in
the game.  It works against both living and undead.  In the old world,
there are only three places, I believe, where a hiding/sneaking rogue
cannot explore safetly (parts of LGuk and SolB, and part of the Hole
if not a worshiper of Brell) (and maybe the planes?).  The situation
in Kunark and Velious is similar.  

This makes rogues the masters of corpse recovery (dragging a corpse
does not break hiding), unless you want to shell out a lot of plat to
have a necro summon corpses.

It also makes rogues excellent scouts.  A rogue can go ahead and find
out exactly what the situation is, without aggroing the mobs.
