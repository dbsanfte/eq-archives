My (abandoned) Paladin on Lanys got his Steel Warrior faction up (for
Hero Bracers quest) by killing Dorn at every opportunity.  When he was
too young to solo kill him I would offer to tank for a group whenever
he was up, later I'd just kill him.  Even when NRo was out of the way
I've often stopped in with several of my characters just just to see
if Dorn's up to be killed.  Kizdean Gix is another favorite target, but
I don't kill Gix unless I'm ready to track and kill Zytl as well.
