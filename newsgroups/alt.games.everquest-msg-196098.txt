Sadly, I heard more than one person in the Nektulos Forest begging. One for 
2pp to buy their spells. The nerve. *No one* had any money. What made them 
think they were so special that we would pass around a hat for them?

I despise beggars. They cheapen and taint everything they touch, and I wish 
them banned.
