But to get 6kpp worth of belts...hmm that's about 2000 belts at 3pp each,
and belts drop off say 1 in 4 orcs - I'm sketchy on the details here  ;) -
so that's something like 8000 orcs slain and you still managed to stay at
low level.

I think for 8000 slain mobs you might have more levels to show for that sort
of time investment.
