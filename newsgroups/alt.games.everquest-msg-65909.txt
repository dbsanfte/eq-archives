You should follow the whole story.  He got hosed
originally by getting a slimline IBM box, which
is NLX form factor.  NLX boards require NLX AGP
cards, they have a short bracket and a notch
cut out of the PCB to go over the onboard sound.

The only NLX AGP boards out there seem to be
Matrox G200/G400 and TnT based cards.  Hence,
the PCI card, much better than any other choice
he had.
