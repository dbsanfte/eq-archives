alternate title

"A Humorous tale of Blunder, Death and Rescue"

My tale starts as I zone into Lower Guk. I do a OOC "camp check" and as
always, find everything of value camped. The player camping the "Arch
Magnus" is a friend however and I send him a tell. Because of the nature of
this post and what happened, I won't give you his name or the name of his
"uber" guild *cough* Grey Concil. Suffice to say, he is a level 56 Pali with
3 times as many days played then my poor newbie butt. I sent him a tell and
he replied , "come on down, we can do the Lord camp as well as the Magnus
camp now.

So down into the bowels of Lguk I went. I met him at the Magnus camp area
and was surprised to see him all alone. "You think we can do both camps with
just ourselves?" I ask, skeptically. "Sure, easy" was the reply. <nervous
sigh>

We waited for the Magnus camp to spawn, killed the PH and the other frogs in
the area, and then buffed to start killing our way to the Ghoul Lord's room.
We made surprisingly good progress and soon found ourselves near the Lord
room. The lord was not up so the Pali pulled 3 out of the room. By using
root park, we were able to kill them all. We then went into the Lord room to
med. The pali said, "See, no problem.... Go sit on the throne and take a
picture." I moved to the throne and the Pali jumped behind me to get in the
shot.

"uh oh"  I heard...

"what?"  I replied...

"I'm stuck behind the Throne!" the Palidan answered.

He tried for 5 minutes to duck, jump and squat is way out...with no luck. He
even camped and logged back in to see if he would appear above the throne. I
even jumped back there to see if he could jump out using me as a stool. No
luck, sigh.

I ask him "I have thurg gate potion, do you?"

"um, no... " he answered.

I told him I would go get some help and he tried petitioning.  I was able to
jump out from around the throne and was telling him I would be back when...
The room popped!

I was sneak/hid and the Bok frogs couldn't see me when... The Ghoul Lord
popped!

 Guess what, he CAN see invis and I was pulped. "LOADING, PLEASE WAIT"...
I arrived in Misty naked and sent a tell to the Pali. He was just fine as
the throne hid him from the room full of frogs. sigh...


I told the guild of my plight, a rescue party was formed. A Druid, Shaman,
Vicar and Champion soon met up with me and we headed back to LGUK. We snuck
and fought our way to the Lord's room, killing all the frogs in the way. We
easily managed to kill the Lord and his 2 friends and I was soon rezzed. The
shaman shrank the Pali and he was finally able to move enough to jump out.
After a good laugh, we headed to the safe hall. About then, the GM decided
to respond to the pali...figures.

So, Moral of the story is... Don't jump behind the Throne in LGUK!
