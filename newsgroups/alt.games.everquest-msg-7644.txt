Quite alright.  If you want we can take this to e-mail as Vengy isn't
participating.  We are used to him pushing this too hard.

I've seen in a handful of books references to dex, and Go pills by

OK, I have tremendous admiration for someone who goes to the trouble of
learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
