I read the trilogy before seeing the movie. The movie played the scene on
the bridge exactly as it was written in the book: Gandalf intended only to
shatter the bridge to prevent the balrog's passage, but as the balrog
fell, his whip ensnared Gandalf's legs, dragging him down too. Gandalf
expended a great deal of his power in that blow and knew that he might
become effectively useless for a time afterwards or even die (hence his
instructions to Aragorn) but he did not set out to sacrifice himself.

In "The Two Towers", Gandalf says that he contended with the balrog as
they fell in to the depths of the earth. When they hit bottom, the balrog
went off running but Gandalf pursued. Eventually, he followed the demon up
hidden stairways to the highest peaks of the Misty Mountains and there
finally vanquished it.

Gandalf says that he was "as dead" and that he lay there, naked and
expended of power, until Gwaihar, Lord of the Eagles, spies him and comes
to his aid. Gwaihar brings him to Lorien soon after the Fellowship
departs, and there he is gradually healed. According to official canon,
the wizards were immortal powers (maiar) and Gandalf's condition after the
battle indicated that he had been forced to shed all pretentions of human
form -- thus, his being naked and, as the Eagle Lord noted, exceptionally
light, no burden at all. He was *not* certain of survival; the balrog was
also a maia, a potent spirit that once served Morgoth, who was Sauron's
master before his destruction at the end of the First Age (of the Sun;
there were several Ages before the First.) and the battle could have gone
either way. In the story, it was the balrog who was vanquished, but it
could just as easily have been Gandalf (putting the necessities of the
tale aside.)

If you want to find a "timeless message" in this sub plot (a practice
which Tolkien abhorred), Gandalf did NOT sacrifice himself knowing that he
would evolve. He expended himself to the edge of death, with the very real
possibility of a very real and permanent death, for the sake of the world.
He descended to the very depths and then ascended to the very heights
where he was saved by a servant of the Most High (Manwe, King of the
Valar, was served by eagles; the great friendship between between Gandalf
and Gwaihir has led to speculation that Gandalf had been sent to Middle
Earth specifically by Manwe.) Gandalf is a Christ figure (or Obi Wan, if
you prefer) not because he died in the knowledge of evolution, but because
he died (or effectively died) *without* such assurances in order to make a
difference between exceptionally little hope and no hope at all.
