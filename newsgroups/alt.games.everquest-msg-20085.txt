this line alone is a deal killer

**For moving Characters from one server to a different server,
Characters will only be moved without ITEMS AND COINS. (IMPORTANT:
Coins and all items must be removed from characters before the
characters are moved (This includes all items located in the
character's bank. All scribed spells will transfer with the
character). Any items or coins that you fail to remove prior to
transfer will be permanently deleted upon transfer. You are solely
responsible for removing any and all coins and items from your
character(s) prior to moving your character(s). **

I can understand how they want to avoid somebody moving to a new
server where he can get "better prices" on the piles of items they've
grabbed up. But I think you could stop that by just allowing a
character to move with items equipped in body slots minus coins. I'd
entertain paying the $50 dollars to get my warrior on my main playing
server as long as he has the warrior equipment he uses, but 50 dollars
for a naked character? Pass.
