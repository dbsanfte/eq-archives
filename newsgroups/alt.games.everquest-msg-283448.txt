As a track class, I for one don't give a damn and am very happy to see
this added.

Originally, I'm pretty sure, it was 1 for both corpse recovery and
experience loss.  I know for a fact that I was chasing down my corpse
in my first few levels.  But that was 2002 when I started.

Veksar is the only one.  The idea that there was a "dungeon bonus" was
always an over-simplification of the ZEM.  SolB, for example, hands out
quite crappy experience, but is most certainly a dungeon.  For anyone
wondering, I browsed through some thread the other day on hotzones, on
the sony boards.  Just an FYI for those that were wondering as I was:
Hot Spots are zones where the base ZEM has been increased.  All
experience is therefore modified, not just for those in a level range
or in a group or anything like that.

Yes and they did that on purpose from what I read.

What percentage of the population doesn't have kunark?  0.5%?  You
cannot have even bought the game (other than aftermarket) without
getting Kunark in the last several years.  They don't even sell just
original EQ do they?

Good motivation to buy the discipline AAs.

Nice for raids anyway.

This is one I am happy to see.  Monks and Bards probably even more so.

They added this with PoR didnt they?  Or was it DoDH?

I am very happy to see my Ranger getting a bump here.  Though it may
not have been as critical to them, Ranger taunt has always been
horrible.

I see this having zero effect on anyone.
