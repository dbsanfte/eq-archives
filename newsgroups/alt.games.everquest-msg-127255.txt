Well, personally, I think if life forms were designed by some omnipotent, 
omniscient, being, he could have done a much better job.  What the heck 
was he thinking, putting the windpipe in front of the esophagous?  It's 
much more likely to get crushed there, and I'd survive a lot better with a 
crushed esophagous.  Only two hands?  Four would be much more efficient.  
And I could seriously do with a memory upgrade.  Can't even hold two phone 
numbers in short term memory at the same time... How lame is that?

The watchmaker argument cuts both ways.  You look at the huge, complicated 
universe ticking over, you think, "wow, a mechanism this clever must have 
had a creator!"  I look at the huge glonky thing and think "sheesh, if it 
was created, it was started at 4:30pm on a Friday, wasn't it?  Couldn't 
even get the planets to fly about in perfect circles..."
