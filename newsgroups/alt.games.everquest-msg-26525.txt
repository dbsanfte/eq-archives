A friend with a L35 paladin has suggested that I (L30 druid) and my
constant companion (L30 Ranger) should go to Velious and hunt in the
Crystal caverns.

I am dubious as to the wisdom of this. Older posts in this Ng suggest
that the journey there is a nightmare and the nearest bind point is
Thurgadin. Personaly i think we are too low to be venturing here maybe
another 5 levels to make it viable. Maybe trying Icelad Ocean or
Eastern Wastes but CC too ambitious IMHO.

Any advice appreciated.

At the moment the ranger and I are in LOIO and we can have up to 4
blues on the go at the same time, root and creeping crud any wanderers
and take them one at a time when the root breaks and the XP to me
appears to be as good a the Giants in FM, without the annoyance of
Goblin chanters jumping you, these are NASTY NASTY :)
