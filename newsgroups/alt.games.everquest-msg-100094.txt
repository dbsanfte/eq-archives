I have noticed the same thing and more at 52 and 53.
In addtion consider this:
I was grouped at 52 (Druid) with two 52 Pallys in DL. Of course we
were killing the skells and I noticed I was getting very little xp out
of cyans and blues. I asked the others and they remarked the xp was
excellent. I was getting about 1/4 the xp they were receiving. Now my
job was to do prime healing, DS, snare, crowd control with getto mez,
and once in a while when bored nuke. Camping and returning made no
difference. 

I have also noticed one of my alts, a Warrior, Im getting better xp
than the casters even though Im Barb and do get hit with a penalty.

So something else is afoot Watson and it may be fouling up the game.
