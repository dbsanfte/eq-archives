Speaking only about the lowbie game (and I do mean lowbie here, sub-20)
there is <no> damage producer who comes close to the BL.  I doubt it's
anywhere near as absurd at higher levels, but it is simply incredible
how much damage they do at low levels.  It's like having a Mage chain
casting bolts alongside his pet but without the need to med mana back
(assuming the BL has a tank partner).  I suppose if you twinked a Rogue
with a high-end piercer he could get similar results once BS skill is
up, but a BL can do it with ordinary crap newbie gear.  Actually, it
must balance out quite a bit by level 30 or so or BLs would outnumber
Druids and Necros combined by 5:1.

Lowbie BL = Bard-like power without the carpal tunnel.
