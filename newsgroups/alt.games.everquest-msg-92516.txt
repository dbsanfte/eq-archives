Two times in the past week I have been camping Village (upper dogs) in 
Velk's Lab and have had a castle train come barreling through.  The first 
was completely out of the blue, and nobody owned up to it, so we just CR'd 
and shrugged it off.
The second one was last night, and occured about 1 minute after a paly 
wanting to join our group get very upset when we explained that we were 
already waiting 5 minutes on the respawn, but thanks for asking.  He died 
in the train, my wizard saved everyone but me, and it seemed pretty clear 
that he trained us because we wouldn't let him join us.
The paly is a member of the server Zergling guild, but I've had decent 
interactions with several members, so I contacted one, got the GM name and 
attempted to contact the GM and two other officers.  None of them 
responded, which was what I expected, so I again contacted the helpful 
member, explained the situaion, and his response was that it's a bug and 
trains just happen there.  I responded that I doubted that, and explained 
exactly how easy it is to pull that particular train.  I figured that as a 
cleric, he never pulled there, and wouldn't have ever thought to pull the 
castle mobs from the Frenzy ramps.  He admitted that he didn't realize 
that it was so easy to do, and then said something that made me think the 
paly really had trained us, but I was logging so I just thanked him for 
his time.
My real question is this:  Do the castle mobs randomly just start rushing 
through the village due to a bug?  I had never heard this excuse before, 
but the person I was talking to is a good guy, and he at least believed it 
initially.  Has anyone else heard that, or is just this the excuse of the 
week for idiots who like to train?
