Graffe's is the wizard website, they did extensive testing with Concusion
to demonstrate that even when fully resisted, you could still drop aggro on
a mob by a constant amount, vs. when not resisted.

The hate component of a spell is applied regardless of whether the spell is
resisted or not, and the hate component of Concussion is negative.

The assumption was that Jolt behaves in the same way.  I don't know if it's
been tested.

However, Jolt and Concussion are hate reducers, you still have hate at the
end, and no spell can reduce your hate to 0 other than those which memwipe
the target.

Dispell is an excellent way to pull mobs, especially in DoN missions with
enchanter drakes around, or places like Tipt and Vxed where the mobs are
brutal enough, never mind when hasted by a 'friendly' Ikaav or Mastruq.
