I'm not terribly familiar with Kunark, but it seems LOIO is good through the
20's and early 30's, Frontier Mts. is also good for soloing carefully at
30+. OT isn't quite worth it until mid-30's or so without a group.

Solo well, but group when you can as well, you'll learn group skills that
you will NEED in the high level game..experiment around and you'll
eventually find a group that you can depend on. Sometimes the only way to do
that though, is to play with pickup groups, or join a guild.

Your mana will run out fast; your DOTs as well as your lifetap spell take
quite a bit of it, and that won't change.. It's not uncommon for me, at 36,
to spend at least half a bar on a blue con, more if the fight doesn't go as
planned. Or, if it's a white or yellow con we're talking a full bar. Use
Allure of Death all the time, and then of course Lifetap to regain that lost
health.

+INT items are better, by and large, than +mana items.

You might also try coming over to Antonica and hunting Lake Rathetear, South
Karana, Rathe Mts., etc. All are good zones for your level, The problem
being that you essentially have nowhere to sell or bank, and will need to
make friends..
