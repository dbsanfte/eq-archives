It's more then just that.

If you go to the Bazaar you will find there is a shortage of good affordable
ranger equipment ~level 30 relative to other classes. The situation is
*MUCH* better for warrior, paladins, SKs, and even bards get some great
choices.

I've also run across some great SK and Paladin weapons that can be had early
and cheap. Just got a SK only Spirit Reaver which is 13 damage, 27 delay,
processes life spike, only .4 weight, with a level 30 druid I started on FV.
As far as I know, there is nothing you can get for a ranger that is close to
that.
