Timorous Deep -

Go to the Oasis of Marr, take the raft to Timorous Deep,
run around the island you land on, there is an aviak tree
village - that's where he's talking about.

Of course, given the new grouping bonuses that are going
in on wednesday, June 11,  you might be
better off finding groups in the new Legacy of Ykesha
zones and develop good group skills while getting decent
loot.  From my experience in Nadox, it looks like 
there is a random chance for some pretty decent loot
to drop off any mob in the zone, not just named mobs.

For instance, I poked my nose in there and knocked off
a few guys that were green to me at 63, and one of them
dropped a pair of 6int, 15hp int caster sandals, which 
I underpriced at 500pp and sold within minutes of going
into trader mode.  We also had random mobs drop a Coral
ring (5wis, 40mana) twice yesterday, plus gems.  Now, this
isn't stuff you can fight at 44, but definitely try to
group there at 50 and solo stuff at 53+ (you can get past
the temple area with just invis and the stuff in the
hallways right there is VERY far apart, you should be
able to single pull the low level stuff.  The second
entrance has some elementals and a couple of troll 
miner guys that you can probably take at 50+, and there
is lots of stuff past the lava (just stay on the wall,
you only take a few hits of lava damage). I Saw a 54
ranger and a healer duoing at the bridge.

Dulak harbor is the cash camp spot for many folks, the
mobs there drop several PP a shot - and you can probably solo
there at 44 with ease - but I can't be sure of the
mob level there, as they were all green and I was just
killing time waiting for a buddy who wanted to go to
Nadox (a 54 warrior) and my other friend (65 ranger
and a 65 cleric bot) and I were going to escort him
and check out where the undead weaponsmith spawns.

A group of low to high 50's can hunt this stuff (same
HP and max hits as stuff in Umbral Plains - Mobs that
were under level 50 (I think, LB at 63) had <10k hp
and hit for around 120 - Mobs that were DB at 63 and
still Blue to our 54 warrior (so 51-53) had 12k hp and
hit for 130's - Mobs above level 55 enrage, hit for up
to 160 and have 12kish HP (Animated Mercenaries and
War Torn Spirits), and the Named hit for 189 max and
had 20k ish HP.

Speaking of Umbral Plains, it has one of the best outdoor
Zone Experience Modifiers short of the Planes of Power
(90) and the mobs there have some REALLY nice drops, and
we used to have a low 50's necro with us in our groups
(with a 58 ranger at the time as the highest level).

Also, a classic place to group at 44-50 and solo at
51+ is the entrance to the Hole - VERY good xp, occasional
nice drops.

Granted this stuff is a few levels away for you, but you 
really owe it to yourself to try to get away from the
the classic "Hunt here to level x, hunt there to level
y, hunt this other place to level z" strategy that all
too many other people are going to try and follow.
