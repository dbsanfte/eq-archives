What can I say, I guess the boards I frequent are populated with people who
have similar feelings to me about the whole issue.  I have yet to see one
post where someone claimed to be quitting EQ over the changes.  I don't have
a lot of extra time to spend ready dozens of boards, so mostly, it's here,
my guilds board, an alliance board, and eqtraders.  I sometimes visit the E
Marr board, but rarely read much there.
