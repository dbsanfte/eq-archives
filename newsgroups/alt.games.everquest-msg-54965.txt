Looking through the resist gear tables I found on the net, it seems
most resist gear things that aren't jewellry are either no or low
AC or total uber and hard to get. Now, unlike a caster, a tank can
not simply give up AC for resist. Assuming I'll hit 50, what resist
gear that is more or less available would you suggest? It could go
as far as more or less easy to get planar items (but not dragon BP's
and such). Thanks in advance!
