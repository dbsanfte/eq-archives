The way that I see it is that the problem with these adverts is that
they are not related to the site.  For example, I am living in the
United Kingdom half way up a mountainside.  I have no gas supply to
the house for the simple reason that it's not possible. 

So, the adverts that I get popping up for US credit cards and UK gas
supplies, amongst others, irritates.

On the other hand I run a specialised web site here in the UK.   I
have no pop-ups on my site (other than links to other sites) and the
adverts are in the page and are pertinent to my readers and I do get
quite a response from the affiliate programs.

People here have suggested that they should pay Allakhazam and, I
suppose, the other sites to stop these pop-ups.  But this smacks of
blackmail to me and for this reason I refuse to subscribe to these
services.   If I could subscribe to get additional services without
having my arm twisted about my back then I would do.

Just my two penny worth.
