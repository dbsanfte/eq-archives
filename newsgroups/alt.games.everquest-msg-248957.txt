Yeah, the manual is misleading on this one. It also states that Vengeance
works if "you" die, but I believe in fact that it only works when someone in
the party *other than you* dies. Notice also that Recovery Aura is described
as working on "nearby heroes" and that this includes the person casting it.

This kind of ambiguity really makes me wonder about other powers that I've
considered getting but didnt because of the various descriptions on
limitations of applicability. I'm going to have to get verification on every
one of them.
