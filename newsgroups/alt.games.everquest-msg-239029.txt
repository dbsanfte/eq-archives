Yep - my current combo of WLK+Lesser whatever of Serenity (I can never
remember the name of that) cost me 10k.  As of the time I wrote the
message above, WLK was 10-18k (there were 5) in the bazaar on Lanys.

The amusing one, to me anyway, is people asking 20k for the Lesser
whathcamacallit of Serenity now.  16/25, 25hp, 6 sta and some AC.

Ornate silk bracer patterns are back down to 110k (from 250k during the
serious plat dupe period).
