Ok - i do admit to liking some of it at some point - but have turned
it off long ago. The music is often not atmospheric. Heck - i LOVE
computer game music. It really adds to the ambiance and sometimes is
over looked.

I DO like the theme in Freeport at the temple of Marr - and at the
bank. However, theres a theme in Kaladim that sounds like an old car i
had once - backfires and wheezes, id much rather listen to a Canned
Heat song played out by scratching on a chalkboard. I think my beef is
that the quality has been so lacking for so long. Even when EQ first
came out, the music was sub par.

Or did you ever play Unreal? The music was very stirring and also
changed to fit the circumstances.
