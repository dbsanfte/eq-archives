    Reading the website, you find that the zones in GoD are for levels 50+.
Historically, "high level" expansions have been raid expansions - Velious
and PoP. Not saying that there won't be XP areas for the whole family, but
as with PoP and Velious, the focus seems to be the raid. I'd also consider
the new leadership XP system to be further support of that.
