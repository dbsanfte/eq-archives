If you are a GOOD cleric, then you will be welcome in a group.

There are two camps.
The GR/LR group is the top one and is two levels below the bank. This is
usually for "lower" levels.

The WR/RR group is one level further down and for higher levels. 

In the Peak times (USA evenings), there are usually two groups and both
can have waiting lists with another 6 players. This is the worst case,
but many times it is easier to get into a group.

At most other times, there is one group operating that pulls all levels
to bottom of GR steps.  

Loot is highly variable throughout the day. Lowest is 1pp/hour to
20pp/hour often.

Occassionally you get an arsehole that tries to solo a room to
themselves, but this is usually lower levels, who get wiped pretty
quickly if they get trained. Higher levels are generally looking for
Amstar's scroll and will often do the pulling for your group as a trade.
/ooc when it pops is a polite thing to do. Arsehole higher levels steal
the RR from WR group, which is weird as there is better pp from killing
nobles, bards and guards upstairs. Most high levels are great and often
offer buffs, heals and pulling out of boredom.

Training by players leaving the WR is a major problem for GR/LR group at
times. Likewise, don't go down to the WR/RR unless you go invis, else
you are liable to train stuff back up stairs onto GR/LR group and/or be
accussed of camp stealing by WR/RR group. People whining on and on about
camp stealing are often the ones doing just that. 

If gobbies go up to Miner Horton level, or guards come down stairs, just
pull off and let the guards kill them. You loose a few, but the guards
soon leave. Whatever you do, do not charm anything when guards are
about. If it is a gobbie or KOs to guards, then you are cactus.

You can not rely on the guards being there if your group is getting
overloaded either. I have often seen no guards on lower levels, which
means you have to run to zone to survive.

When you arrive, get bound at band, get prepared with everything for
fighting, then /ooc looking for a group in ??/??. A /w will give you an
idea of numbers of groups. You will piss off a group if you are not
ready to roll when you are told to come down.

Whilst waiting for a group, following the guard killers and collecting
high keep flask (only 9cp) is a very good way to learn the castle
layout. If you do this, you will also find an occassional jackpot. I
also went smithing with rusties I collected as well whilst waiting for a
group. 

Also spend time running from GR/LR group position to zone just in case
you need it {:-).

Fighting in the WR/RR with different groups can teach you a lot about
tactics. Good clerics often get complimented.
