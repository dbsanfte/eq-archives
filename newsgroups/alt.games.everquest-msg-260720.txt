I stand corrected. Its only 4x150+ 600+, not as bad as 900... but still 
a CTS inducer to do all at once :)

Wasted? Leather padding sells for a pretty penny too, last time I 
checked.

Jewelcrafting at 54 however...heck ... even up to 70 its less than 
3pp/attemp. (electrum + malachite)

The point is... if you can get ~10 skillups per stack, which is what was 
claimed with a twinked int/wis. Getting to 54 would require <7 stacks, 
and could probably be done for a total of 180pp and 140 combines. This 
is way way less effort than ~600 combines.

And the 180pp doesn't factor in any sellback on success (yes I know its 
nerfed, and i know its not profitable, but you might make a 1/5th  (??) 
of the money back? Just selling to merchants.

At any rate were talking less than 150pp when all is said and done. If 
that's a big expense... you can make it back selling need 10 lousy 
spider silks sold @15pp, which even a lowbie can farm in under 10 
minutes.

I recall it taking quite a bit longer. Hell, if you figure a 3 second 
cycle time just on the Tradeskill Window (I'm guessing on that one) 
that's 3x600 seconds = 20 minutes, and that's not counting the time 
handing 400 successes in 4 at a time. 

I figure its probably -at least- 40 minutes of constant clicking effort.

Possibly I'm more negative than I should be. But I found them dreary and 
numbing. I was hoping for something a little more ... interesting when I 
heard about them, since I simply wanderered over and tried them. Imagine 
my disappointment when he have me some crap pointed accross the room and 
said start clicking. At least you knew how pointless they were before 
you got there. :)
