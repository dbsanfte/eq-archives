It does seem that way... and if the tank is experienced and the rogue is
experienced, and both are paying good attention, (you know, in a perfect
world) it does work that way.   And, also in a perfect world, the tank would
be closest to the mob and the rogue farthest, to aid "hate" aggro even
without the root.

Sadly, it doesn't often work out that way.  Tanks, especially inexperienced
ones, don't always get right up on the mob.   It can be uncomfortable
meleeing when you're standing so close that the graphics screw up as your
head lunges into the spot the mob is still occupying with each swing.  You
also run the risk of crowding too close, such that you're standing on top of
the mob.   At that point the mob can literally start to spin in place, as it
determines that you're fractionally in front of it, or fractionally behind
it, sending the rouge in a fit of circle strafing.

It also takes constant attention to maintain this positioning.   Rogues have
very little push, so as the tank(s) and pets are kicking and bashing away,
the mob starts moving backwards more and more on top of the rogue, at the
same time as the tank gets farther and farther away from the mob, unless
both are constantly adjusting thier position by increments.  Maybe 1 kick
won't be enough to make it closer to the rogue than the tank, but what about
the second or the third?    Add in a random proc root, and sooner or later
the rogue starts taking hits that he doesn't want, and perhaps losing
backstabs, even if he's watching his positioning.   Because the root came
just as the tank bashed it a bit closer.  The smaller the hit box (You can
hit a giant or dragon from across a room.  No difficulties at all
maintaining max distance there.   On a skeleton mob you have to be within
half a step.) the harder it is, and the more adjustments you have to be
making.

Even if it can be made to work, all in all it's a much more stressful way to
play a rogue instead of just hitting evade every so often.   And why add
stress to the game, unless you're getting some real benefit out of it?
Unless I'm mistaken, the earth pet isn't significantly better damagewise
than any of the others.
