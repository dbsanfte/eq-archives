If I were stupid enough to give you my login info, and you stripped
my character bare, could I pursue criminal charges for theft?  I
really doubt it.  In fact, you already agree that Sony has the best
claim "Now if Sony had removed the plats ..."  In other words, you
believe that Sony has the right to destroy that plat, regardless of
who's account it's in.  Therefore, the data that represents that plat
is Sony's.  If courts decide that players own the plat and items on
their account, we just opened up a HUGE can of worms.  

1.  Can you ban a player without compensating him for the value of
the items/plat he has?
2.  If a hardware failure causes you to restore from backup, do players
have the right to sue for the lost items?
3.  When EQ becomes unprofitable, can you just shut down the servers
without compensating players for their items/plat?
