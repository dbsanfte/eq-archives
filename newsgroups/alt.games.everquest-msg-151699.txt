Haha I wish.   I haven't actually spent a single penny on him with my monks
money (monk has a lot of plat.. but thats cuz I never spend it.. ever)

I got him some decent/nice nodrop stuff from skyshrine (by killing with the
monk), the eboots I killed for myself, and the bonecaster robe I took off my
mage (my monk won it on a pickup group random xxx months ago)

I am gonna buy him a direct damage 3 item and Ft3 boots soon though :)
