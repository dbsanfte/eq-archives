Oh, I might put that stuff up for sale for a high price.  Lately all my 
vendor's been doing is just being a chat logger for my friend's channel. 
Just so my vendor has something to sell I bumped the 5 bones for like 10p 
each.  I don't expect to sell them but if someone wants to buy it for that, 
cool.

I used to sell summoned items as well, but quite frankly it's a pain in the 
ass to summon all that stuff.  Sure, it's virtually pure profit but it's 
still a pain. :p  I doubt I'd put a price of 95p on them, but 50...yeah, 
maybe, just to keep the sales nice & slow so I don't have to re-supply any 
time soon. <g>

In answer to your usual question, Biz, work's been really busy these last 
couple months and I've had barely any time to goof off here.  I just refuse 
to work the last half hour of a Friday if I can help it, and that's why I'm 
here now. :)  I'm MOSTLY playing EQ2 no Everfrost but I am newly in a guild 
in EQ on Zebgony (Xegony/Zebuxoruk) and I'm having some fun playing there. 
EQ2 is still my first pick though.

Anyway, it's time to go home!
