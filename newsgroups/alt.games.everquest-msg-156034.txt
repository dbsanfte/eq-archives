 Just curious as to where. We fight him on his perch where we've always
fought him. I guess some people used to pull him up into the tunnel but
we never saw the reason for that other than CR if necessary.

 Being snared sucks. At least it wasn't snare with a knockback. Annoying
thing about these guys is the hit-box is rather small.

 Yes, this one was tricky. A little adjustment on our part and he
dropped without a problem. Like you we were pretty light on casters
since our force was keyed up based on the zone pre-revamp.

>Number 4 - this dude had a 1500 dmg ae and (iirc) a dispell.

 Yes, a dispell on him as well as the 1500.

 I think we got some of those boots too. There was no effect or focus
which was a bit lame. I think if they added something like that they'd
be more desirable.

 Yes, way better than it was with the three named that were there
previously. Since I was never there pre-awakening I'm not able to
compare it to that.
