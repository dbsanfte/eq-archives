This person probably hasnt grouped much in pop. Id sooner have a sk or pally
over a warrior any day, cos they can get agro fast and keep it. (Im an
enchanter) Necros and to a lesser degree wizards, also realy need that high
agro MT if they are to do their job properly. Sadly I still meet palies in
POV who wont stun, even when told why its needed. Trials keeps out most of
the ebayers, but I suppose some ebayed accoutns are already POV flagged.
