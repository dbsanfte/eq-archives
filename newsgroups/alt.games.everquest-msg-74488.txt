Gix is a pain in the ass:
Was about to get this lowbie his corpse from the middle of the lake,
and we were standing at that single hut (Maula Fishcatcher) when he
got jumped by Gix.
Send my pet on him, to save the lowbie, and before I could fear Gix
off and /pet back off, he was dead.
Ugly faction hit again :(
