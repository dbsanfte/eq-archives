The other thing those guides to 'making thousands of plat an hour!' tell you
to do is go to the bank in Freeport and beg.  No kidding, back in pre-Luclin
days, I saw a guy hanging out in NFP begging everyone who walked by for
money, and feeling both disgusted and chatty asked him why he was demeaning
himself so.  His response was that he'd bought one of the guides and this
was the suggestion on how to make a fortune...

I suppose they've updated it to begging in PoK, now.

Sad. Truly sad.
