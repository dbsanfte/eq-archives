When you die you lose only "real" exp, when you get a rez you gain only
"real" exp points.

The simple solution to staying level 52 is to get high into the level (heck,
one
kill from 53 is still 52) and then turn AA to 100% and leave it there.

This is a godsend for the people who need drops of Vox and Naggy for
their epics; once upon a time they were forced to waste any exp they might
have pulled in during the several weeks they would spend hovering under
53.  Now all that exp is useful, offering positive advancement.  While the
really cool abilities aren't available till post 55, getting 6 points in the
first tier
will mean being ready to get second tier stuff the moment you level up,
and you can bank points if you are so prolific at AA leveling that you've
built up more than that while still too low to take full advantage.

There should be no danger of losing level 52 from deaths, as there wasn't
any reason to stop getting Real exp till you were almost to 53, but if this
is a concern its simple enough to turn your Real exp back on for a while.
