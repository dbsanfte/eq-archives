The problem is you don't appear to have actually accomplished anything
by switching weapons. The amount of dps you took away from the mobs
isn't enough to save you if you were otherwise going to die; the only
real effect is on how often the healers have to heal you. That is
insubstantial compared to how much damage was lost from you using a
weapon that doesn't even reach primal level. You also lose some aggro
from the lesser dps that you may have to get back with snare lowering
even more dps.

In the end, what have you gained? You may well have *cost* the healers
mana by switching weapons even though your defense was better, by
allowing the mobs to hit you over a longer period of time. That, of
course, depends on who else with you was doing damage. And the fact it
takes longer to kill is itself a negative.

So, my own advice would be, for the same people who you just advised -
don't go to a significantly lower quality weapon for nebulous AC/skill
bonuses; unless its truly significant (say, sword of sshraesha level
AC boost over no AC at all and you're not near the caps) you probably
aren't gaining anything unless the healers are constantly on the verge
of losing you otherwise - in other words, unless you absolutely have
to have the additional ac/skill bonus to survive.

Yes. You're right. Use all the tools in your arsenal. Just don't use a
recoilless hammer when you need a Phillips screwdriver.
