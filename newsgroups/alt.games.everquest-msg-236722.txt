From what I gather (haven't done them yet), if you do the instanced
dungeons you will, at best, have to run through 2 zones (Qinimi and
Barundi) where mobs can see invis and will hit for up to 700. Even if
you have a necro-sk along to summon once you get there, it's still
gonna be a pain. 

Having a necro/sk along will surely help (especially a necro who can
potentially FD and rez in a cleric) but I hate having to bug one to
summon corpses if we don't happen to have one along to start with.
