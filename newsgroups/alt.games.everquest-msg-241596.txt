Thanks, Jazz.  I know it sucks for you, and I really do empathize, but
I am feeling a LOT better about cancelling my account Wednesday.

I might come back, but if they don't get things fixed up prior to the
launch of some serious competition, then I'm likely not to bother.

The weather is nice, the su  is shining, and WoW and Doom3 aren't
coming out before fall.  I won't miss it much right now.
