You are using hide and sneak not because you are a druid, but because you
are a halfling. It is a racial ability for all halflings. As far as I know,
unless you are a halfling rogue, you will not be able to train these and
they will never go up. However, they should work occasionally. Look to the
messages you receive when using the skill.

Remember though, you can only use one at a time, meaning you can't hide AND
sneak at the same time - only rogues can do that.
