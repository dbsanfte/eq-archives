 Ok. Fine. But if Verant will not restore passwords to people simply because
they cannot produce an account key number, that is harm. If I lost all the
time and work I have done with the characters on my year and a half old
account I would certainly call that harm.
 
 Do you really think losing your account key number is grounds for losing
the entire account? I certainly do not.
