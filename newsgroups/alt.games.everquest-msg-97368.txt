I agree with you Lokari.  When I was a true newbie, (first days/weeks with
the game, learning to walk and communicate) it took me some time to to learn
how to find my corpse, make macro keys and all that.  Many higher levels
were very patient with me and coached me along--by the time I was lvl 10 I
felt like I had the *very basics* down, and was able to learn some of the
more intermediate skills needed to both advance and to have fun
(tradeskills, checking out guilds).
     It takes time to learn even the most basic of things, and by lessening
the time it takes to reach lvl 10, it could quite possibly send even more
people who don't have the basics down out into the big wide world, more so
than now.  How would this help GMs and guides save time or what ever in the
case of *true* newbies?  It just seems to me that the faster leveling would
foist spoon feeding on them instead of leaving it up to the players
themselves to network with others and learn things on their own.  For people
with alts this is a sweet little change, but for those who are brand new to
the game it might be problematic for everyone in the long run.
    As for the rest of the changes, I kinda like the no book thing (please
see my wee post in the Krist on a Kraker thread:))
