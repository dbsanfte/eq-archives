I began playing EQ two and a half months ago.  I still consider myself a
poor druid.  (only 100pp in the bank right now, and I'm level 29).  A while
back I posted a question to this forum on how to earn some money in this
game with my level 19 druid, and I received one excellent response.  One
individual suggested binding to Gornit's isle in OOT, hunting Captain
Surestout for the Bracers of Erollisi, and porting back to WC to sell them
for 50pp.  This has worked pretty well for me these past ten levels.  (got
some slightly better gear and my lvl 24 and lvl 29 spells).  However,
sitting in EC, I see items being auctioned off at prices unfathomable for
this druid.  10kpp, 20kpp, 30kpp...  That's a lot of Bracers to sell...  So
my question is this:  Being level 29, are there any other methods of
obtaining plat which would be more effective at this stage in the game?  I
know all about selling ports, etc, but I'm curious about other items that
can be obtained relatively easily and fetch a higher price than 50pp.
