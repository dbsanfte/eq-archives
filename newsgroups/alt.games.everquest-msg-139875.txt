Clearly you're interested, but the only answers you're likely to get
will be vague at best. Clerical melee damage simply isn't of enough
interest to enough people, for them to put the time into parsing to
decode the equations and tables.

Probably the only way you'll get a definitive answer, is if you parse
yourself. Go to Wakening Lands, and toe-to-toe with a_haze_panther while
logging all hits for several hours with each weapon. You won't get
accurate results on regular exp mobs because their levels vary -
a_haze_panther is generally chosen because it's an exp level mob with a
fixed level.

The only other option is to take anecdotal results of what 'seems' to be
doing more damage over time. For that you'll need someone with both
weapons, and a penchant for clerical melee. I doubt there's more than a
handful of people across all servers in such a position, so I doubt
anyone has posted such specifically unique results. 

If you want to know, your only option is to try it yourself.
