 FFA in the sense that when someone yells 'Camp check' you can't respond
back with "Ancient Cyclops!". Since AC is a random spawn he can be
considered FFA. However, I would expect standard rules of engagement to
apply once he does pop, which they oftentimes don't. Meaning first to
engage gets the mob.
