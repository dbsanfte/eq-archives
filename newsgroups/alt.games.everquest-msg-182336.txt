OT: Personally, I've never been a big believer in the benefits of the 
full group xp bonus. It's all well and good if there are more mobs than 
your party of four or five can keep cleared, but too many people think 
it's this fountain of xp that starts to flow once that sixth person is 
added to the group. I hate it when i'm in a group of five, waiting while 
the puller runs around the various spawn points ready to tag the next 
pop, and someone suggests that we invite a sixth for the full group 
bonus. Your share of xp/mob with a full group is still smaller than it 
would be with a group of five, even with the bonus, and if you can't kill 
enough of a greater number of mobs, you wind up worse off.

If you know of a way to accomplish that in PC or BB, please let me know.
