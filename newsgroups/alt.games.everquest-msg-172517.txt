How you guys and gals were able to get the Ring of Fire (which is what I was
looking for!) from that incredibly nebulous description I have no idea, but
thanks very much!!!! I am constantly amazed by what this board is capable
of. Wowzers! The Callers thing in Fungus grove sounded cool too. What kind
of force do you need for it?

Apikoros 50th Shaman on Drinal who isn't quite high enough to do the Ring of
Fire just yet but might be able to do the Caller's Quest
