Okay, so I'll admit to not following this thread too closely.  I just want to
clarify something for my own curiosity.  Is 'il128' = 'Paul Phillips'?
Because, if this is the case, Paul Phillips has certainly posted here within
the last year, not *Years*.

If course, not of this may apply or matter.  It may just be that I haven't
had enough caffeine yet this morning.
