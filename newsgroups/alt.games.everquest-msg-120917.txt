Well, I have to say, I disagree. First they've said more level III stuff is
to come. Second, they've said some items got the wrong effects and are going to
be changed.

But even still.... Enhanced healing on a +Int item that drops easily. WOOP.
Ok, so you have an item thats good nwo, but you have to give sopmething up for
it - maybe when the new III items come the NToV drops will have healing AND
wis.... in other words, if you want the easy focus's its a tradeoff. Still
available to all, but as always the best gear requires more work.

What if all the easy to get stuff thats in now had focus effects AND
great stats how would they create high level loot without being totally
overpowering for PoP and the further Focus III items still to be added?

And hoorah. It helps the ubers too - I'm not in a top tier guild,
Sontalak and CT are about the top of our range right now, but thank
fuck for this... The number of guilds contesting the top end make it
miserable even for those who CAN do it. Alternative routes can only
help reduce the pressure too, and frankly more commoners in the pool
sounds great if the pool gets made 20 times larger too.
