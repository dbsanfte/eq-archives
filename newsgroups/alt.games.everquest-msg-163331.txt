LOL.

Anyone that's two boxing a bard is a masochist. The only thing I could see
two boxing bard with would be a cleric since they have more genuine down
time than most other classes (at least, from the 8 classes I've played any
of so far). Since there would only be one toon to worry about heals for
(clerics can and do get busy in full group situations, and can get downright
crazy when they have to do cross-group support), it might be managable.
