Nope.
It has everything to do with  Haste.
The quivers that have weight reduction also have a haste value. It supposed to
be equivalent to the reduction value, not sure if its been tested and
confirmed, but that would give the fleeting quiver a 60% haste value -
something most people would consider parting with 4k for.

Don't think of it as being outnumbered,
think of it as unlimited target selection.
