Well, if the buyer and seller both have SoL, the Nexus
could become a good trading place. If they are on other
sides of the world, they can bind, run to a Nexus gate and
gate back to where they were.

See above. Unless you are somewhere totally away from
it all, you should have no more than 3 zones to a Nexus
gate.  The worst would be if you are in ill omen (or there
abouts) and cannot run thru DT. Then you have to take the
boat to go to Gfay. The boat is fast, but the wait in FV is LONG.
