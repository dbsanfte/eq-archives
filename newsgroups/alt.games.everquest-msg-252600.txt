And your point is?  The statement I responded to qualifies the
mobs in no way, rather obviously referring to normal speed mobs
who would always gain slightly on you when pursuing, just as you
would always gain slightly on them when roles were reversed.

Oh, and btw, terrain like NRo's makes it fairly easy to escape
faster mobs (depending on just how fast the mob is, of course).
If you have the HP left to risk a small amount of falling damage
without slipping into deathmarch mode, properly timed and aimed
jumps can build a substantial enough lead to make it to a guard
or zoneline.  Of course, get your jumps just wrong and you can
do a fair imitation of a new Bard trying out his drum in the
desert for the first time.
