Since your biggest beef here seems to have to do with the iCH that
druids get at 58th lvl, it's kinda hard to ignore the high end spells
for the other classes. 

Druid/Mage always seemed balanced to me. Nukes are about equal, druids
get heals and mages get free DPS from their pet. 

Driud/Wizard, at least pre-50th lvl you probably have a point. Druids
are good enough to fill in the DD and/or healer slot. At those lvls
druids are argueably the most versitile grouping class while Wizards
are probably at the end of the line when it comes to finding groups.
Post 50 I think it's relatively balanced (neither druids or wizards
are particularly looked for in groups) and post 60 it swings back
towards the wizard. 

Druids pay for their early power at the later levels, imo. Some of it
is just perception, a druid is so easy to level that a lot of them
don't really know how to group at higher levels so pickup groups tend
to avoid them if there's a cleric or shaman around. But at 50+, druids
and wizards aren't competing for the same slot anyway. Nobody takes a
druid as a DPS class at those levels and odds are they'll be 3rd in
line to fill a healer slot in any group. 

I'm usually grouped with a druid since two of my best friends ingame
have druid mains, but it certainly isn't due to their being
overpowered.
