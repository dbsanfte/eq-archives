My Ogre Warrior with STR 150 WT 350 did the same thing off of the tallest
tower in Oggok (took near 400HP damage on one jump).  I was in 3rd person
view so got some good screenshots.  One he had his body laying face down on
the ground (the point where you are just hitting or looks like you hit, but
your /loc hasn't been recheckeJZKS see that you are on the ground and need
to be standing up).
