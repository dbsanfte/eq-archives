Offering a contract that violates a law, criminal or civil, is just as
much in violation of that law as actually entering into the contract.

Here are more:

Guy offering to sell drugs, but doesn't actually make the sale.
Guy offering to sell a stolen car, but doesn't actually make the sale.
Guy offering to sell a hacked access card for a DTV system...
Guy offering services to MAKE a hacked access card for a DTV system...
Offering to sell bootlegs of movies...

Probably the last ones are most related.
