"You know, there are few days when you wake up and think, "It's good to be
alive." The first time I ever heard Linkin Park, I thought to myself, "I'm
glad to be alive today so I can hear the shittiest band of all time." And
that is really something, when you think about it. Of all the bands that
have ever been and will ever be, Linkin Park is the shittiest one. Kudos to
them."
