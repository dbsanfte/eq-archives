Harmshield and DA both drop you to the bottom of the hate list.  While 
it might be possible in certain circumstances to use it to position a 
mob, its not possible to tank a mob, or offtank a mob, with it unless 
the mob has absolutely nobody else on its hate list.

As for the frontal arc restriction, if you're tanking a mob and you 
can't keep it in your front arc... well I can't think what you're trying 
to accomplish.

You can, in short, tank, in WS.  Not for log admittedly.
