You'll get no arguement from me that for the money amd is very nice. I just
like the intel name more so I use that.

As far as the new intel line for next year (and please, correct me if i get
something wrong cause im going on memory)

They will be 64bit.. have either 2 or 4 meg caches, intel reps said they
werent sure if the extended cache size would make a difference or not but
when they tried it and tested it it made a noticable difference, now they
are toying with the notion of FSB, increasing it to see what kinda diff that
makes. for the moment though they will all be 800mhz fsb. and will support 8
gb of ram (woohoo!)

One downside however is they will all be hyperthreading.
and my current OS (win2k) doesnt support it. only WinXP.. I guess its not a
big deal since a new mobo/processor/ram usually entails a new install
anyway. but learning the subtle changes from os to os is a hassle.
