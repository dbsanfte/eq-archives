There are many sound problems, I've given up worrying about them. I don't
get the 'ding' either and when I am in wolf form I stop barking sometimes
after casting and it isn't always the same spell cast and it doesn't happen
every melee. To tell you the truth, I went for three months with sound off
and didn't miss it at all, it wasn't until I downloaded EQu and played
around with the text colour settings that I thought I would go back to
having sound and I find that it is still as disappointing (from the number
of problems point of view) as ever.
