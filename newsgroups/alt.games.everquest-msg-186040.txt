It's so true. The average player thinks he knows what he wants and is
frequently wrong.

Another issue not mentioned here is that the type of player happier
without the easy ports may be different from the type of player who is
in love with them. The game without the easy ports might be less fun
for one person and more fun for another.

It is painfully obvious though that the "maximize efficiency for
leveling" lobby group is gaining ascendancy and has been for a long
time. This is, as I mentioned elsewhere, the consequence of a mature
game. No longer is Norrath looked at as a world, but as a collection
of zones one moves around in. Not everyone sees it like this yet but
that's the general direction things are going.

In any event, we already have evidence of game design around player
convenience rather than a world - we call it AC2, and no one likes it
because it's boring, lifeless, and lacks character. You get those
things from the quirks, the inconveniences even.
