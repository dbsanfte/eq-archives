Hoping to get your Spectral Parchments off the Spiders in Nightmare now
the ubers are moving on?  Too late, the nerf is in, good luck getting
those L63 and L64 spells kiddo.

Wanted to help your friends get through the Justice Trials by zoning in
a group with 30 seconds left on the corpse?  No chance kiddo, that was
just so the top guilds could get through quickly now you poor fucks need
to wait.

But don't worry, by the time you get to Valor, we'll have dropped the
ZEM down so you don't get an AAxp every 2 hours at 100% (and similarly
quick regular XP).

You know, I don't understand it.  I genuinely don't.  Verant spend a
majority of their resourcing on the people who actually COST them money
(time played by uberguild members will make them profit negative
resource hungry customers) and they somehow end up ALWAYS letting the
people with the most time to spend actually spend the least time on the
progression.  It boggles the mind.  But that's Verant.  Someone,
*anyone* get a business savvy individual in there to run the development
side (rather than just the commercial side).
