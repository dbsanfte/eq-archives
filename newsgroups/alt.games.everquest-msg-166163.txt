I use a regular chisel for velium and acrylia, and can make bits out of
bricks fine, and use a regular file for boning. It's the essence that's the
real problem. At least it only costs 26 pp each from thurg if you buy it;
combine essence is a nightmare to get unless you have lv 55 + farmers, I'd
say, so that ten mountains was deep deep green.

I go through 3 stacks of coldain essence a night easily just practising
smithing fishbone dart tools ( i found it was cheaper than ornate armor,
which i can't sell for quids). I have gotten my tailoring to the point where
i should be making acrylia, but the ingredients are just sooooo annoying to
farm, and overpriced in the bazaar, that selling decent items for a profit
is impossible (perhaps when they are triv it is economical, but now forget
it) that skipping acrylia and going to arctic wyvern masks actually seems
cheaper. Is this what others found? The only bottleneck seems to be the rate
of cobalt cod fished, which at max fishing skill still seems inadequate...
maybe they need to extend fishing beyond 200 or make it vendor bought.

A side note, the darts you can make have 225 range (ideal for pulling, very
light weight) and seem like a decent way to get to mid level fletching ina
hurry for thsoe with fishing skill, but the market for them is extremely
poor. There's very few trade skill ways to make money and this isn't one of
them.
