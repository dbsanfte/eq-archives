Some quests aren't worth the trouble, but there are many many others that
are worthwhile.
Just to name a few: Practically all mid-level class-specific quests; Lots of
newbie-quests (afaik all caster classes get a quest to gain an additional
spell for a few lvl 1 mob-drops and all cities have newbie-armor quests);
The velious armor quests; The Thurgadin Ring and Shawl quests; The
caster-cloak quest (involving Priest of Najena in Unrest); Ghoulbane; Stein
of Moggok; Lanseax (sp?); Epics...

All in all there are loads of quests. Some are only worth doing for the
faction, but a lot give nice items. Run through the quest databases on the
net and pick some you think yield things you can use, or just seem like fun
to do (Coldain Shawl Quests for instance, don't try until lvl 45-50 though)
