Since your group doesn't include a single DPS class, and is a 4
man group when it appears that the dungeons are just as hard for
4, 5, or 6, its amazing that you managed to pull it off after
all... or perhaps its pathetic, one of the biggest complaints
I've seen about LDoN is that its far too easy.  A group as poorly
put together (for the explicit purpose of chewing up mobs fast...
its actually a charming little group) as yours can -still- take
care of business very reliably?  

But at any rate, my point is that you weren't having trouble with
LDoN because you were two boxing, it was because your group
wasn't designed to kill mobs fast.  Your repairs all went into
that same area; cleric melee, improving SK melee, adding SK pet,
adding chanter pet... more DPS.

You'd have succeeded just as handily by swapping out any
character except the SK for a rogue... or heck, even the SK and
letting the shaman sponge might have done the trick.

Still, I think your victory despite the odds against you is far
more to be savored than doing things the easy way; overcoming a
challenge is the most satisfying thing you can do in EQ.
