I generally only worry about it in groups with my main anyway, none of my 
other characters are going to see anything worth worrying about.

I may have been burned by NBG, don't know, but, that's the way I prefer 
to play.  I have recieved some very nice items that way, and I have seen 
others recieve items that way as well, that I could certainly have sold 
for a decent amount of plat.  I tend to group mostly with friends and 
guildies, so, the issue does not come up much.

As far as tradeskill items in LDoN, it has yet to be a real issue, as I 
have not doen that many adventures.  If multiple people are interested in 
the item, you random between them, if only one person speaks up, then he 
gets it.

Basically, I assume that the people I am playing with are being honest 
until proven otherwise.
