Is it just me or are we starting too see a  major influx of new payers in EQ
here lately?

I am blown away about all the newbie posts and begging I have seen on Bertox
over the past few weeks

Or is it just Bertox?

I have played a bunch of other MMORPs and found that EQ is still far
superior to all the other ones I have played; (DAOC, Shadowbane, EVE, E&B,
AC2, Rubies of Eventide to name the bigger ones.)
