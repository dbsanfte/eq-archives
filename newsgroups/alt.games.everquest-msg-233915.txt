I can relate to this rather well. I created a pally on firiona vie to play
with friends, and found out that I hated playing him when they weren't
around...and often even when they were, so they ended up getting way ahead
of me level-wise. Finally, this weekend I decided to delete him and create a
new character with the same name...this time a cleric. I've enjoyed playing
him, and got him up to lvl 14 over the weekend (with some help from the
friends, but mostly on my own), and although I have 30 more levels to go to
catch up with my friends, I'm enjoying playing this guy a whole lot more
than playing the pally.
