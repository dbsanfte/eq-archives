EQ2's model was similar to this (it may have changed, I stopped playing a
long time ago).  You engaged a mob or group of mobs, and 'locked' the
encounter.  If you ran, the mobs would follow for a time and then break
off, breaking the 'encounter', no one else could engage them until they
made it back to their spawn point, which they did at speed as soon as the
encounter was broken, this includes the original person who engaged them.
So you couldn't exploit it, because as soon as the encounter was broken,
they legged it back and even if you shot at them they ignored you.
