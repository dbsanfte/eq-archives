I still use my old trusty centi warhammer since I got at lvl 1 :)
Oh my hands mostly are full with a Spirit Tome and Testament, so just use
the +2 wis on the weapon and sometime to finish the mob. My 1HB skill is
about 116 and my 1HS is 36. 1HB's are a good choice there are more around
that have wisdom stats on them then 1HS.


PS: Dying at your bind place is BAD :(
