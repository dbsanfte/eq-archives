Certain combines need to be done in the mixing bowl. These are usually
sort of early steps for ingredients for a final product, such as
making dough to bake a cake with. Most final products can be combined
in either a spit or an oven, the advantage of the spit being that it's
portable, but has fewer slots than an oven.
