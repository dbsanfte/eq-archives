Not supporting the Davidians...but I can think of quite a few things done by
accepted religious leaders, founders, saints, etc, that are a little loony
if you tried them today.  Heck...pick out a few pages of the Old Testament
at random to read and chances are you'll find more than a few acts that
would have gotten those guys a little jail time.  Sacrificing sons and
daughters, attempted murder, kidnapping, rape...it's all in there...and it's
not done all by the bad guys.
