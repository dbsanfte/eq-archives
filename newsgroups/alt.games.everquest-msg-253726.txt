Your a fucking asshole self serving fuck like the rest of the SUV owners
out there on the road. If the automobile companies  would just stop
chasing the mighty dollar and cease bulding these huge beasts so asshats
like you couldn't go out and buy them EVERYONE including your precious
kids would be much safer. The idea that people are buying cars that are
too big to fit the standard parking stall or parking ramp is laughable.
When I read that the new SUVs being built need a safety bar under the
front fender to prevent it from driving over another car in a head on
crash like a monster truck we have gotten a little carried away with the
size of these SUVs. 

I guess selfish people like you have no problem wiping out somebody
elses family as long as you and yours are safe huh? Your a piece of shit
and deserve to be shot in the fucking face. 

Not to mention the amount of fuel these things consume but I guess your
safety again is more important right? When gas gets up to $2.00 a gallon
here and morons like you are cruising around in vehicles that get like
15 mpg we again have a problem on our hands as a whole and not just your
safety.

Be a normal person and buy a normal sized car then the debate over which
car will win in an accident won't be an issue.
