I took a couple groups of guildmates into CT last night, just to get 
everyone familiar with the zone and give some of our newer members exp day 
alternatives to Seb/Velks.  (I was amazed at how scared of CT some people 
are, and these are folks who will gladly walk to the bottom of Chardok and 
back with a single group and no enchanter.  I guess the ebayers/griefers 
killing themselves and others at the zone-in scares some folks off.)
Anyway, I ended up ML for the KS group, and while we didn't see a single 
named mob, I have a couple packs full of trash loot.  Stuff like Gooey Goo 
and Unbroken Mosquito Wings.  Is this stuff for trade skills, quests, or 
just vendor junk?  I have maybe 100pp worth if I sell it to the vendors, 
but don't want to be kicking myself in the ass next week when I find out 
that the Gooey Used Snotrag is the rare drop required for the bard Armor 
of Rockstardom and Big Hair.
Anyway, I check the general EQ sites and didn't see anything, but figured 
the tradeskillers would know.
