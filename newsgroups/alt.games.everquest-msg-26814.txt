No. Seems it's a recurring IE bug, where it decides to take security
into its own hands and block everything without the settings ever
being touched. My brother has now fallen in love with Opera, and if he
wants to fix IE, he has to contact Microsoft and get it done for a
fee, or do some nifty registry editing (which might mess up
everything) to get rid of it, or try to hack the password IE made up
for itself.
