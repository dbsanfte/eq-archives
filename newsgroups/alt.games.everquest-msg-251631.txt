Melee :D

In LDON situations I(63 Cleric, 16AA) usually have Yaulp5 and MoK up in my 
two "swappable" slots (my other 6 are pretty static- 1 CH 2 Cele Du Jour 3 
Remedy Du Jour 4 swappable one 5 root du jour 6 swappable two 7 DB 8 DA). 
That way I can stop DSes (which really *can* hurt in an ldon, especially in 
a big room where some kind NPC caster has dsed all the mobs) and melee. I 
usually throw in a nuke or two for good measure also.
