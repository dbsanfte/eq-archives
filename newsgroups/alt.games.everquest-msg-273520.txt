I disagree. Getting your first bag was a big step... but not a difficult 
one. A small box was what 2 gold? Being able to actually afford an 8 
gold backpack... now that was luxury :D

Even if you include LDoNs they are literally holes in the ground. There 
is no reason for anyone to be 'passing thru' anyway. So its sort of a 
moot complaint.

That inevitably was going to end. The trip is not that dangerous for a 
large number of classes even at low levels. An enchanter can safely do 
it at like 4th.. but even a class with no invis/sow/ivu utility can 
reasonably safely make the trip in their teens... provided they know the 
way.


> > The slow boat rides were FOR IMMERSION; you felt it was real. 

Unless the boat got stuck, or you fell into the ocean after zoning, or 
the pad-thing in Erudin didn't come out to meet the boat, or you got 
attacked by a shark through the bottom of the boat.

The boat as concept wasn't bad, when it worked. Unfortunately, too 
often: it didn't work.

And while I didn't mind making the long trek once to explore or meet a 
group. Having my SK die in Trak's Teeth to an add when bound in Oggok 
sucked. Its some 10 zones, and a boat ride, and very difficult to 
shorten the trip... I can't bind my own soul... so have to find someone 
else to do it for me... if no pure casters are around then i don't get 
bound.


> > The dark was for IMMERSION.

And far too video card dependant. Some players couldn't see squat 
running in the commonlands because their lanterns only worked when they 
got close enough to a geometry vertex for the vertex lighting to kick 
in. 

The idea of darkness is great. But if you can't implement properly, 
don't bother. What the point of making it dark, and then giving players 
lanterns that don't work unless they are standing near a junction in the 
geometry. In a flat zone like the commonlands or karanas.

Factor in random gamma correction from manufacturer to manufacturer and 
two humans one running on a VoodooII and one running on a RivaTNT ... 
one couldn't see 3 feet, one could see like it was a bright moonlit 
night.
