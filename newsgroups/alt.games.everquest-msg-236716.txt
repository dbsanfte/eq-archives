Enchanters are also a powerful solo class, especailly at the high end.

I too have a very bitty play time at present so generally solo when
I've just got the odd hour, HoH is a favourite or, if I'm feeling
brave Plane o Fire as root/slow doesnt work as well there.  When mobs
that hit for 700+ are running at you it can be a bit worrying.

At lower levels ole Shiny Bob (your animation) works quite well.  As
you progress charm allows a far greater dps but there are risks.  For
good guides to soloing a chanter check out the forums at therunes.net.

I beleive bards struggle at lower levels until they get a few ae
spells, although I rarely play mine these days so I dont recall what
comes when.

Druids are easy to solo using dot/root method & I beleive that necros
are too but Ive not had one of them.
