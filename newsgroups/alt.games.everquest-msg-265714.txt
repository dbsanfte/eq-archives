Here is the lynch pin of your whole argument. It only works if this is 
accepted as -the definition of Killstealing-.

This is precisely what an argument of semantics boils down to.

Now, a word in a spoken language is defined by how people use it, not 
how its defined by the devs of a particular video game. 

A great many people, including me, including the EQ player base, 
including vast chunks of the MMoG/MUD comunity, including even many CoH 
players, and including KDragon use the word killstealing to descibe 
activity that exceeds your very narrow definition.

Thus your assertion that killstealing be restricted to the definition 
you provide is false, and your whole argument doesn't work.

Now your argument would still have some life in it if people -in- CoH 
primarily used the very narrow defintion you provided, as that would 
suggest a 'regional dialect'... but alas a quick search of the CoH 
forums for kill steal also comes up with no shortage of threads 
describing activity that again exceeds the very narrow definition you've 
held up and calling it kill stealing. 

In fact... here's a delightful thread on the official CoH forums, no 
less, on bless my soul, the very thing we're discussing: The definition 
of kill stealing.

Here's a couple nice consise quotes to spare you the read:

"Well Kill stealing to me is anytime someone engages on of my targets 
that I am clearly fighting and do not need assistance with"

"Kill stealing is exactly as these gents have explained... stealing the 
kill. If it's obvious the mob is being pounded on by a scrap, is held by 
a controller, is on fire from a blaster, etc, etc. And someone runs up 
whips out a sword and cuts him down than it's a stolen kill... "

And there are several more anecdotes along the same lines. So, these are 
CoH players on the CoH forums, discussing their experiences in CoH, and 
describing what they think killstealing is in: CoH. 

And it isn't what you've described at all. Face it, your argument's last 
lease on life has expired. Try not to thrash.

Me too; it wasn't easy, for the same reasons even. But I managed to keep 
at it. Don't worry though, I'm done with you unless you wish to start 
over with a new argument, because there is simply nothing more to say 
about this one.
