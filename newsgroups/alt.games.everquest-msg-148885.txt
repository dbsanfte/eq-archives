So suppose there was a requirement that you already had a high level
character?  I read somewhere that they were considering something like that
in DAoC: if you have a level 50 on your account, you would be allowed to
start new characters at level 20.

What might be interesting would be to give an XP boost if you have a high
level character, based on the difference between your current level and the
level of your highest character on the account.
