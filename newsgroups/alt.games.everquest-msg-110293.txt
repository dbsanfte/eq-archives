I know some of you follow the trade skills closely, and there were lots
of changes on test.  I was wondering if there was any word on the long
awaited Troll Cultural Armor that has been reported as "incoming" on
Eqtraders for a long time.  It occurs to me that this might be an option
for advancing smithing skills past 175 in place of ornate chain or
plate. If it comes out cheaper, even if some stupid tempers are required
that I'd have to go hunt or auction for, I'd certainly look into it.
