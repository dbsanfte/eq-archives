Bard mana song specifically stacks this way, which is why
I mentioned the 5 bards and a wizard group... each bard
is capable of putting out almost C3 so the wizard ( a class
capable of actually -using- this ) has roughly C14 mana flow

For crowd control purposes, its chanter, bard, necro, uh
oh who's got root memmed, in order of capability.  If
you only have four or five mob overpulls to worry about
a bard can do a fine job.  If you only have two or three
mob overpulls a necro can hack it.  If you only have single
mob overpull my freaking cleric can handle that!

Unfortunately the lowbie bard with high level partner plan
means that the bard stops being mezzer, charmer, slower,
snarer... bards have to recast every few tics and their
effects don't last long at all.  While a lowbie shaman will
eventually stick that Slow and it will last the rest of the
fight, the bard will eventually stick that chain, it will
last 18 seconds and you'll be back in the soup.
