It's not about balancing, it's an epic, it's not supposed to be held by 
any cleric that just want it. Its effect is awesome and very useful, it 
would suck if every cleric could get it easily IMO. Maybe they should 
make ragefire a triggered mob , but a lot harder to kill, so the ppl 
whinning about the ragefire camp would be whinning about the fact that 
they have to be in an 'uber' guild  to get it. But then what? the 
clerics from VT raiding guilds are still using it... I think the quest 
is rather easy to finish for such a powerful effect on a weapon.
