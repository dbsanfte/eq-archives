Not yet, but really, really glad I added that last little bit in there, 
now I look like 98% ass, rather than 100%.  I still can't believe it, and 
am anxiously awaiting further info on how they're going to do it.  The 
problem is that I can't think of a solution that doesn't lower the total 
number of kills required to reach 60 that won't cause certain people to 
LOSE a level.  
I wonder if that splash you heard was EQ jumping the shark.
