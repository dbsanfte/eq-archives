"David Monks" <dmon@indigo.ie> the bleeding asshole bled all over his

Here you show what kind of cunt you truly are. Your definition of "law 
abiding citizens" is complacent, compliant fools, the kind that supported 
the nazis, and you betray your agenda with what you define as "law abiding 
citizens"; you equate anyone moral enough to be a "law abiding citizen" to 
be someone who never questions the government and is always ready to obey. 

You also prove the original American spirit right. Of course any man who 
had the integrity to stand up against a fascist government when "law 
enforcement agencies" came to "pick up" the only thing that keeps the 
government in check would "stick out like a sore thumb." In a world with 
cunts like you around, men with the character and decency to stand up for 
what is right is rare.

I would like to thank you, however, for exposing what liberals really want; 
a world where everyone leaves "protection to the forces of the state"; aka, 
like Russia when Stalin ruled, and China of today. A world where there are 
no checks or balances, and nothing preventing the government from doing 
whatever it pleases to the defenseless masses... along with the belief that 
the government has a divine right to murder, torture, and wage genocide 
upon innocents (and those innocents should be forced into defenselessness), 
because the people are only "commoners". A world where those who don't eat 
and breathe obedience and subscribe to a "Big Brother is always right" 
mentality do stick out like a sore thumb, and anyone who would not blindly 
give up their self defense to a government always seeking to erode rights 
and freedoms is looked upon as evil. (I'm sure there would be re-education 
camps for them in this liberal utopia of yours.)

In short; you not only approve of Bloody Sunday, you think the government 
has the DIVINE RIGHT do it with as little inconvenience as possible when 
they decide to do such a thing again. Maybe someone should "pick up" 
yourself and give you the proper check and balance that comes with your 
supporting fascism in this way. A ticket to Ireland won't be hard to come 
by; maybe you should expect a visit soon.

That is because Europeans are good slaves to their masters. Europeans know 
their places as serfs and do not struggle when their freedoms, liberties, 
and basic human rights are destroyed. That is why their is freedom of 
speech in America, and none to speak of in Europe.

Use a Game Boy in Greece, go to jail 
 
Ban on electronic games applies to everyone, even tourists 

Sept. 3 � In Greece, playing a shoot-�em up video game could land you in 
jail. The government there has banned all electronic games across the 
country, including those that run on home computers, on Game Boy-style 
portable consoles, and on mobile phones. Thousands of tourists in Greece 
are unknowingly facing heavy fines or long terms in prison for owning 
mobile phones or portable video games.

GREEK LAW NUMBER 3037, enacted at the end of July, explicitly forbids 
electronic games with �electronic mechanisms and software� from public and 
private places, and people have already been fined tens of thousands of 
dollars for playing or owning games.   

The law applies equally to visitors from abroad: �If you know these things 
are banned, you should not bring them in,� said a commercial attach� at the 
Greek Embassy in London, who declined to give her name.
Internet cafes will be allowed to continue to operate, providing no games-
playing takes place. If a customer is found to be running any sort of game, 
including online chess, the caf� owner will be fined and the place closed. 
        
The Greek government introduced the law in an attempt to prevent illegal 
gambling. According to a report in the Greek newspaper Kathimerini, Greek 
police will be responsible for catching offenders, who will face fines of 
5,000 to 75,000 euros (about $4,980 to $74,650) and imprisonment of one to 
12 months. �The blanket ban was decided in February after the government 
admitted it was incapable of distinguishing innocuous video games from 
illegal gambling machines,� the report said.   
  
The Greek gaming community has reacted with a mixture of shock, disbelief 
and anger. One Web site, www.gameland.gr, has started a news service about 
the ban and opened a petition to protest it. In addition, it is posting 
English translations of the law and messages of support from around the 
world. 
A test case is to come before the Greek courts next week, and the Greek 
gaming community is already planning protests in the event that the 
defendant is convicted. 
�We are trying to organize a protest against this law,� said Petros Tipis 
of Thessaloniki-based gaming company Reload Entertainment, which has had to 
cancel a gaming tournament that was to be held this week.
       
CASE COULD GO TO EUROPEAN COURT
If the prosecution of the defendant next week is successful, said Tipis, 
the Greek gaming industry will take the case to the European Court.   

In the meantime, Tipis told ZDNet UK, a lot of people in Greece are very 
worried about the new law. �They are taking it very seriously,� he said. 
�It even affects the games that come with Windows. This law isn�t the right 
one,� he added. �It is unfair. It was introduced too quickly.� 
 Reload�s tournament, which was to be held on Sept. 6, was a qualifier for 
the CPL Oslo 2002 gaming tournament. �Now we are trying not to lose the two 
slots we were given from CPL for the tournament,� said Tipis. �This was the 
first time for a qualifier (for this tournament) in Greece.�
