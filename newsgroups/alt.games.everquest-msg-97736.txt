No buildable stat can increase your chances of avoiding interruption.  Yeah,
you should work on your WIS, but that's besides the point. :)

Channeling skill is what helps with interruptions.  I can't recall if you
have to put a training point into that, but you might want to zip on over to
Steamfont, run to Kelethin & go visit the trainer to see if maybe you forgot
to train in it.

And like Valien said, sometimes the game is just screwy and hasn't noticed
that you've stopped moving yet.  A lot of the time if I'm running, stopping,
then casting (while kiting or whatever) I'll stop...count to three...then
cast.
