Well both games have been altered a good deal and arguably are 
more alike now than they ever were previously. But anyway to 
answer that we'd need to know more about your likely playing style:

-- how many hours a week are you likely to play?
-- how long do you think you'll typically be able to play at one 
sitting?
-- do you have real-life friends or family who you expect to be 
playing with a lot, or do you expect to mainly play with people 
you meet in the game?
-- what play-style do you think more appealing: exploring the 
gameworld at a leisurely pace, or becoming a powerful character at 
a rapid pace?
-- what's the relative importance to you of the gameplay (variety 
of quests or challenges, etc.) as opposed to the environment (how 
cool the game looks and sounds)?
