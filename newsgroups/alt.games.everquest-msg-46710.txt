As a caution, EJ is fabulous up to 48, still very good at 49. At fifty,
I'm finding that more and more of the mobs are starting to green out.
Don't get me wrong, I'm still finding a good number of blues, and the 48
in our party gets xp off everything, but I'm having to get a lot more
selective on my pulls. I wouls guess that 51/52 is about it for that
zone unless you pull nothing but dinos and flowers, which is not easy
with all the monkeys, leaches, tigers, skeeters, etc. buzzing around.
