HARD on newbies?  My level 9 necro collected some pelts, swirling shadows and
silks in Shadeweavers, sold them in the bazaar and had 300 plat in no time:  

20 plat each for HQ hopper hides 
5 plat each for medium and low quality hides
45 plat each for swirling shadows
3 - 5 plat each for silks

This was on Seventh Hammer, which has been a very nice place to play, BTW.
