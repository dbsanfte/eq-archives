I have a L60 druid and a L56 ranger. Though the druid may be higher
level its the ranger I consider my main nowadays and the one I vastly
prefer playing. (the ranger is Betony for those of you who sit in
serverwide.age btw) The ranger has never been powerleveled, all exp
honestly gained. That's important to mention considering what I'm
about to say. :-)

However now that I'm 56 I've essentially run out of good things to
fear kite. Sure theres animals in WW... sometimes. And the snakes in
JP are still blue... but four rangers can keep the entire zone clean
of non faction animals and there are far more than four rangers in JP
on Xev these days (at least when I play). There's a couple other
places but the animals are in general too light blue or grossly
inconvenient to get to or pull.

So, I've decided to give the ranger some soloing help with my druid
when there isn't a group available (yes I will check for groups first,
nowadays they are far better experience).

Here's the question, though. As I see it I have two soloing options.
Which do you think will be faster? 

1. I can solo normal mobs with the ranger, straight meleeing (at 56
with no AAXP a ranger can't efficiently bowkite solo yet, you do less
damage than you do with melee by a considerable margin) and heal/buff
with the druid as backup. Simple, straightforward, one at a time mob
killing, but I am forced to go for lower dark blues because anything
higher will take a gazillion years to kill and may well run my druid
dry. This seems to be the logical way to go, but....

2. The druid can group with the ranger and then quad. This means
splitting half the experience, but it may well be more than I would
get ranger solo one by one kills anyways. Skills aren't a worry, they
will come in groups and really by 56 its not like I have a whole lot
of skill points to go. This has a couple advantages, my druid can
hammer down low blues for her with FoK very fast, and these are
somewhat higher blues for the ranger. The downside is that quadding
entails some downtime, and half the experience will be going to the
druid who really doesn't need any more.

So, in the opinion of the learned here, which way will be better?
