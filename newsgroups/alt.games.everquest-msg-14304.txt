Speaking of those annoying mean casters. I was selling at the gypsies in
oasis when I heard this funny moan/slash sound. I turn around and come face
to face with a spec! CLOSE!

After running in circles and wetting myself, I find that this spec is just
sitting there and has..... one of the pet'ish names.  DOH!

Someone had parked it next to the gypsy while I was busy doing my selling.
grrrrr!
