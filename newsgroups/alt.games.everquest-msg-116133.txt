    Of course morons are responsible for multi-trains in Karnors. But the
exact same morons are in Sebilis, in Chardok, in Maiden's Eye, in Velk's
later in life. Why do some of those zones have ugly trains and others not,
if the same players are in them all? Zone design.

    Heh. Heh heh. Where do you think those Seb players came from? Karnor's.

    You camp clerics in Sebilis? Not many safe spots, and most overpulls
that would require a camped cleric would beat the snot out of anyone that
sat down. I'm impressed if you can keep aggro long enough to get Tiru out!

    The key requirement on Sebilis is trivial. Howling Stones has a serious
key requirement - that's why it goes empty a lot. I see a LOT of Seb groups
these days go in without evac - people are cocky, and melees assume they can
find an x-loc out at zone-in or make the run to zone-out.

    Right. And they'd do the exact same thing in any other zone if they
could. Only zone design can prevent trains. Let's take Karnor's, for
example. Put a big wall up the middle of the zone-in, and turn it into a
one-way zone in and out (forcing folks to train right). Move the two corner
"safe spots" deeper in, say to halfway to the back of the zone. And
fine-tune the aggro radii so someone fighting in RCY won't aggro a LCY
train, and vice versa. Congrats - you have just reduced the number of trains
in Karnor's significantly, without changing who goes there.
