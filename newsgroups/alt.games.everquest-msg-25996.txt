I tried several variations and it seems that "count" only works in
conjunction with "all" for some reason. You can get a count of the whole
server, broken down if you wish by class, race, level etc.  However,
doing it for the particular zone you are in (i.e. without the "all"
argument) does not seem to work. Wonder if that's a bug, or an
intentional way to protect the anonymity of anonymous players?
