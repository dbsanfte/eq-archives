Okay, you're crossing into troll territory. I said that was a
reasonable definition of roleplaying, and the one that I was going
from when I initially responded. The point, which evidently went over
your head, was that any definition that had people playing something
they weren't in real life is acting.

Your own subject case then proved me right.

Understand it yet? It is getting very difficult to argue with someone
who seems as dense as a brick. You don't seem to understand
*anything*.

And, Koster's comments quite frankly proved my point. The gibbled
point you seem to be trying to make continues to be irrelevant to
anything I said.

I thanked him because he provided context you didn't, showing that he
didn't even remotely believe your definition of roleplaying was
standard or even his. He gave four examples of what could be defined
as roleplaying

>>- living through a story with an alternate identity
>>- merely having an alternate identity
>>- acting as if you were actually that alternate identity
>>- building up statistics that mathematically represent an alternate
identity

All these support the broad definition of roleplaying, not your
idiotixc idea that roleplaying is only roleacting.

Yes. MY point. It reinforces that the broad definition of roleplaying
is not only widespread and commonplace, it is virtually universal. The
rest of my point follows.
