What does one *really* have to do with the other. Donating a chunk of 
time and money to go out there and hands-on help build a school and 
hospital is very noble, and I have the utmost respect for that. But why 
exactly do the 'natives' have to be 'converted as part of the deal'?

And I mean 'converted', not 'saved'. More often than not, these people 
seem to have already got a religion of some sort. Who are Missionaries 
to tamper with their faith?

I lost my faith in "Missionary Work" when a Protestant minister I ran 
into was organizing a Mission to Brazil, (as coincidence would have it) 
expressly to convert *Catholics*.
