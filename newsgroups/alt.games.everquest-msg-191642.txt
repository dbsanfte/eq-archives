It sounds to me as though you need either Microsoft Internet Connection 
Sharing or a router.  I don't know how your DSL connects to your computer, 
so I can't guess whether you need a second network card in one of the 
machines if you're going to use ICS.  

When choosing a router, do a few searches to see all the problems people 
have had with using Linksys routers for EQ.
