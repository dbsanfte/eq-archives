Ok keep seeing a lot of information , some right some not on how to
select an off hand weapon. THis may be more important to high damage
table classes but would still apply to all duel wield classes. First
off have to establish some givens on game play:

Given:

At a Duel wield skill level of 252 the probability of swinging
off-hand is 78% as often as primary under optimal conditions.

If duel wield check passes and weapon delay of secondary passes you
swing off-hand. If either fails no swing till next check. If the
secondary weapon delay is too high you will miss a lot of
opportunities to swing.  

Duel wield is checked each time Primary hand weapon swings, not
independently. Please if you don't agree with this point post a good
source for your view as yet I've found none. My own unscientific in
game testing of using a slower (hands 14/29) primary and fast (jade
mace 9/18) secondary seems to support this, couldn't find any instance
of secondary swing unless proceeded by primary hit or miss, but only
used two mobs. It would seem bad design but have seen worse ). Show
hits and misses, discount reposte and wade though the spam cause
there's a ton of it.

Therefore:

If the above is true then the fastest possible primary (with a good
ratio) should be selected. For instance jade mace at 9/18 would be
preferred over a 11/21 or such. Several reasons come into play for
this but staying on subject it will check for secondary more often.

Now for the kicker, what delay for the secondary weapon? 
It would seem logical to keep that delay within 122% of primary. On an
18 delay primary, 23 or lower delay on secondary would be preferred.
Easy enough so just use 2 jade maces or so it seems. Since you only
will be successful on 78% of checks for duel wield a higher delay is
possible and indeed called for due to the higher damage and better
ratios allowed by the slower weapons. 

I chose for primary the 9/18 with a 13/23 secondary  and was impressed
with the results over 9/18 and 14/27. Damage improved beyond the
slight improvement in ratios I expected to see. 

So kick it around a bit if Im wrong no big deal cant play atm anyway
but would seem to point to a better guide than simply putting the
higher delay in the offhand slot I've seen posted before. Also allow
some tuning of weapon selection based on other than what's hot this
month.

Now excuse me while I put more tape on my glasses )
