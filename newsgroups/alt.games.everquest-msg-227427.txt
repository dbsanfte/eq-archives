emeralds for cash?

Thats not a pp cheat, its an exp cheat, even if you -did- use it to get 
wealth, you didnt use it to create wealth.  It would also fail fairly 
rapidly just because there's not -that- big a market for the darned things!

I know, he said (or seemed to say) that there were other methods and 
most of those have been stopped... but this particular paragraph just 
doesn't cohere.

Splendid
