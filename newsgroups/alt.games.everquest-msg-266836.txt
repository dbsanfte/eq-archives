1. Whether you believe the revenue used came from EQ1 or not, funds that
could have been spent expanding and repairing EQ1, were spent building EQ2
from scratch. Whether you believe EQ1 is ultimately fixable or not, there is
no question it could have benefited in the very least from more developers
devoted to bughunting and testing.
2. Whether you believe the revenue used came from EQ1 or not, funds that
could have been spent marketing EQ1 and obtaining more badly needed newbies
were spent selling EQ2 as a new product.
3. From the very moment it was announced, potential newbies were turning
away from EQ1, concerned they would jump on a dying bandwagon. We had
several posts in here of people asking "hey I was gonna start playing EQ,
but I heard EQ2 is coming - should I wait for 2?"
4. The drain of EQ1's actual players into the beta and now into EQ2 live.
EQ1 was already suffering a lower than normal population from the recent
Gates/Bugs disaster, but it had won a lot of that credibility back with
Omens. Now it undeservedly loses yet more playerbase to the newcomer.
5. The ultimate death of Everquest 1: Exactly how many new players do we
think will want to play EQ1 with a product called EQ2 on the market? I'm
going to take a wild stab in the dark, and guess roughly 0%.

How do I feel about that, I don't hear you ask?

I think EQ1 actually funded EQ2's development and marketing. I think that
while I was paying for one product, Sony was taking my money and making the
next product - which I then have to buy all over again if I want to continue
playing. Without getting too dramatic about it, they basically plundered my
favorite game of all its resources - money, old players, new players,
marketing, and devlopment - to make the new product. I'm not a happy camper.

So what should they have done, I don't hear you ask?

Well, obviously I would have prefered there be no EQ2 whatsoever, and all
those developers and all that marketeers devoted to making EQ1 a more
balanced game and bringing more newbies onboard. The same damn graphics
engine should have been (and probably will be) brought over to EQ1,
modernising the visuals for a second time. I started EQ1 in september 2002,
and had tons of fun from day one - all the game needed from the newbie's
perspective was MORE PLAYERS. It wasn't until about level 30 that mudflation
began to hurt, and not until the 50's [pop] when class balance became a
problem.

However, if they weren't going to do that, they should have either announced
the truth about EQ2 from the outset - that it is a replacement, not a
parallel game at all - and offered EQ1 players incentives to come across.
The way they're doing it now is probably going to make them more money
though, and more fool us.

Kuloth
