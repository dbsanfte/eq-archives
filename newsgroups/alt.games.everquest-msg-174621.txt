After the initial shock, I didn't have problems... but I did have to modify
the way I played, and there was more use for tools like CE, SE when I got it,
DvA when I got that.  Perhaps you'd consider my previous play style
incompetant... but since I could push the envelope further outside POP than in
it, and still live and do well, I can't see how it fits that definition.

Of course I adjusted fairly rapidly, and to be frank, appreciated the
challenge of the higher heal aggro in exp situations.  I've heard, though,
that the same heightened heal awareness on some of the raid level targets made
the game extremely difficult for clerics (oddly, not for other healers)

Good or not, I'm just reporting on what I observed, heal aggro was radically
different last night in POV LC, compared to what it was like several weeks ago
when I was playing... incompetantly?   I've been far more conservative of
late, so the change could have been made before this last patch series and I
might not have noticed.  I can certainly tell you that anywhere, old world or
new, if I land a 4K CHeal on a bow pulling warrior who's put a grand total of
one arrow and no taunts into a target who isn't even in camp yet, I'm going to
expect that mob to come for me.  This was an error on my part (well and on the
part of the warrior, I -told- her to wait the 30 seconds) and I didn't get
punished for it as expected.  POP wouldn't have to be special for this to hold
true, heck, try it  in Kael if you like.

I spent at least an hour deliberately doing all the bad healing I could muster
(without interfering with the exp group I was in), early heals, chained fast
heals, heal and sit (took my horse off), heal from melee range... I was
beginning to think -all- heal aggro was gone.  This was on three different
MAs, 62 warrior, 63 warrior, 65 warrior.  When I finally managed to heal pull
it was by doing so again on incoming, with a pair of chained supernal
remedies, and pulling off a monk (shiruken damage as opposed to arrow
damage?)  Even then, I was only hit for a round or two before the monk (a no
taunt class mind you) got the mob back off me.  Did the monk do 4k damage to
the mob in that 6 seconds?
