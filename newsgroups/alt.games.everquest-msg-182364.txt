They're all reasonably-sized now.  Most of them have been
reasonably-sized since around 2000, in fact.

What, you mean Eyeglazer and Coli?  No, neither of them have posted in
a while.

Oh wait, you mean the two in my .sig.  No, they haven't been here

is too busy doing whatever the hell it is he does.

because Atma's just too damn attractive to get away from.

Gave 7499 Netstalker Points to Cypher because there's no such thing as
a good day on AGFF without JT bashing!
