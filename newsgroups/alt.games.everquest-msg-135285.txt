If by "they" you mean gay people than:

a) No, we don't all prefer that, and
b) We don't all prefer the same thing, and
c) While you'll never get everyone to agree, "GLBT Communities" (note
plural) probably has the biggest acceptance, while "Homosexual
Community" has the least.


Then there are people like a friend of mine- he is gay, but the only
"community" he considers himself part of is the small farming township
in which he lives and works.
