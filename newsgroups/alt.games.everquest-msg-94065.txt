Hehehe. Go for it ).  Has it's ups and downs.  Every level you get a song or
two and they work without instruments.  If an instrument is wielded for the
certain type of song (percussion, brass, stringed, etc.), it makes the
effects of that song much more powerful.

I had to go to http://www.eqdiva.com/ and look at all my songs as being new,
I have no reference as to what they do.  This is a really good Bard site
IMHO.

For the same reasons as you, I guess, I didn't want to play a Bard.
Twisting all the time while fighting or at higer levels just becoming
support.  I used to find Bards useless, until I grouped with one that was
level 32 and max singing skill.  My mana bar stayed at top performance.
Thanks little Bard! /thumbs up!

I say try it out but, give it a good shot.  Not just play until level 2 and
quit.  You start noticing that there is ALOT more to this class after level
5.

Well, just posting my 2cp.

Chris
