All games are repetitive. Perhaps I should have made it clearer....

In Planetside you capture bases for your empire. There are 5( I think
it's 5...they all look so similar there could be more or less
"different" tyes.) different base types. They all use the same
textures inside and out, and the only real difference between them is
how they are laid out. To capture a base you have to fight your way
inside and "hack" into the central command console and hold it until
15-minutes passes. Capture 1 base or 1000, it pretty much all looks
and plays the same. 

That is what I mean by repetitive. 

>pull, kill, pull, kill, pull, kill, pull, kill, level, pull, kill, pull,
>kill, pull, kill, level...um, you don't think that's repetitive?

EQ is repetitive, but you have literally dozens of different zones to
choose from, and hundreds (thousands?) of different mob types to kill.
You can also choose different race/class combos. In EQ you advance in
levels and gain new ablilities. In PS "leveling" gives you access to
more weapons and vehicles, but it doesn't change how the game is
played.

See my explanation of "repetitive" as it applies to PS above. All
games are repetitive. (Baseball, Football, EQ, etc) But "good" games
throw in enough variety to keep the repetitive parts from boring you
to death.
