In groups, I love having a necro around.  At high levels they can group 
lifetap, giving 80hp/tick to each groupmember, taking 80/tick from the 
target mob.  Before I had Canni V, this was awesome, I could canni 
nonstop, without pausing to heal.  They can snare, they can slow (undead 
only), they can mez (one mob only), they can rez, they can FD to assure 
someone lives if you are somewhere deep, they have great pets.  Oh, they 
can twitch too, if the need comes up to reduce downtime.

Mages are a great DPS class, good pets, good casting damage output, cool 
summoned items.  They have cool spells vs summoned mobs.  There are some 
raid targets where pets are unwelcome, but, many where they are.
