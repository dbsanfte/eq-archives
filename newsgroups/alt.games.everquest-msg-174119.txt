Gee, since the Americans are doing this all the time, I guess everyone
else is just stupid for appeasing them. *rolls eyes*

The very attitude that guarantees more terrorism. Didn't you learn
anything from 9/11? Apparently not.

How? You won't go after who you need to, because some of them are
American friends. Some of them are too strong to intimidate. Some of
them are just plain crazy and can't be predicted.

Things are different. The arab world wasn't threatened by the cowing
of a dictator who was asking for it, just one nutcase was. So, the
same could be said for the Taliban, who were asking for it. No one
else is; at least, no one else the US will touch. They will, of
course, go after a few people who *aren't*...

And that's what they feel is threatened. Back a rat into a corner and
see what he does.

That's whats so sadly funny about Bush's private war with Iraq. If
they have weapons of mass destruction, then attacking him will
guarantee he uses them. If he doesn't, then there's no excuse to be
there at all and the arabs will remember that. It's lose/lose. Unless,
of course, there's other reasons for going....

Scary words indeed. Pax Americana thrown in our face. The bigger they
are, the harder they fall. Rome, China, Britain, many others could
tell you that. What makes you think you're any different?

You aren't.
