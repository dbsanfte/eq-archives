 Me and my girlfriend play together in game and use the same cable line but
to two computers. Seems lately we've both been going LD alot but one
difference is she can usually get right back in game. It takes me sometimes
up to 5 to 10 min's to get back in. Last night she actually had time to log
in and watch me finally go LD and then leave game. I've died because of that
lately and was hoping someone would have an answer for me on what to do
about it. I have plenty of computer to handle game and don't think that
would be it. Thanks for any help out there.
