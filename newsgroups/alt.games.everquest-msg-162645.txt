That is true, if you engage first, then, according to Sony, the mob is
yours, and they do view KSing poorly.  You did attempt to work it out with
the person, rather than just barge in and take the spawn, so, I doubt that
too many players would view your actions too poorly either.  All that being
said, doesn't mean that if he does KS you that anything will be done about
it.
