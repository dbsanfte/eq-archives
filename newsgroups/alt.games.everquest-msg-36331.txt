You have a level 57 cleric on the same account as your level 48 warrior.
You have 2 computers
Your 43 warrior is damned tired of being stuck with level 49 rezzes (or
level 39, or none at all) instead of the killer 56 rez that your cleric
could do for you, if they were only on a different account.

At least, that's why I moved my brother's 57 cleric onto a different account
last week.  Just to stop hearing him whine anymore is well worth that 50
bucks. :)
