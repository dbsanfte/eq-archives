Ok, just gotta laugh at this one. From EQCaster's Realm
(http://eq.castersrealm.com):

*Sleeping on the Job*

Person writes to the EQ Developers' Corner: I'm a bard, and sometimes I
get really tired and just want to lay down. How hard would it be to give
everyone a FD of 1 so they could just lay down. Or better yet, when you
are in the middle of the zone and no where to run from a train, just lay
down and die for them. Make the Faint have no practical purpose other
than to amuse /faint or /lay - rather than sitting. On that note, what
about adding some sleeping bags and pillows. Oh and cookies and milk
too.

Absor replies: Not a bad idea, I suppose. I'll mention it to the team.

But, well, milk and cookies are already in game. Pillows would be
unbalancing, though, and we don't have plans to add them in the near
future.

I have to wonder, in what possible way would pillows (1 HB, 1 dmg, 32
delay, procs Suffocation at 30th level) be unbalancing?
