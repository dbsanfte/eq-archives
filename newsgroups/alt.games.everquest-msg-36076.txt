Hehe how did you now that? well i took a trip to the island to get the
kiola nut and guess what i was killed and had to petition to get my
corpse back *argh* died twice on that stinking island, will send my
human druid there instead, i guess that the kiola nut is not a no drop
item, maybe my druid can get the stuff from erudin to since he is
based in qeynos it is not very far.
