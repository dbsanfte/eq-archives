It took me a little while to find these guys.  They're NOT the
Jewelcraft merchants, nor are they called Gemcrafter as their
"category"; the Gemcrafter is part of their NAME (Description).

Anyway, yes, these are relatively modest augs, but for those of
us who haven't made it far into DoN or wherever such augs might
otherwise be available, they're better than nothing.

There are four types: direct heal, direct damage, HoT, DoT.
They range from 31.5pp for augs that work at level 10, up to
504pp for level 50, doubling the price every 10 levels.  The
level 50 versions heal 61 direct or 100 over time; the damage
ones do 70 direct or 100 over time.

They're all limited to slot 4, and only for melee/hybrids.  And
they're No Trade, so don't send an alt to do your shopping!
