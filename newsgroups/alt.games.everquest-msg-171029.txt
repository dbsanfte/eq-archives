Very nice card. I just got one and its great for the $165 or so price
tag. It is right in the middle because its FAR BETTER than an MX card
like the four, better than the geforce 3, while not breaking the bank
since we will eventually all get nvidia FX's anyway.

Reading the EQ tech boards people have problems with ati 9700, I don't
know why.

You won't notice a diff probably going from 2100 to 2700 ram. I don't
know if 2700 would be unstable, though. With good ram its probably
fine.
