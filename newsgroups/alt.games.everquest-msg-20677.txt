I dont think a lot of people notice this, but the "scrunchie" color is
determined by what color leggings you are wearing. Strange hey? I like to
keep taking off and putting on my legs, and the only thing you can see is my
scrunchie flashing. No one ever notices. ::sniff::

But anywho, I'm wearing mammoth hide legs and JBoots. I think. And theyre
both black. There are probably other thing that will change them balck or
other colors, but I'm not sure. I concentrate on getting too many robes.
