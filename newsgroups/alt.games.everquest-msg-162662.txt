Yes. All pets and NPCs never take any evironmental damage, like drowning
lava or falling damage.

No point to it see above.

Yes they can and it helps. They can even wear the focus jewelry that
a mage can summon. You can even give them 2 earrings and 2 rings, since
npcs ignore the LORE tag on items.

Monster summoned pets can't equip weapons and armors, even if they
are monsters that normally can like an orc.

Higher level pets automatically bash, they don't need a shield.

One little tip. Use the fire pet. Hugely underestimated by most mages.
That innate fire shield they have is a HUGE mana saver and its more
damage than the one you can cast. The fire shield is the pet level + 2.
For instance my level 49 fire pet is a level 41 mob so that means its
fire shield does 43 points of damage!! I can only cast a 25 point shield
and that costs a lot of mana to keep casting it over and over. In a typical fight
a pet gets hit at least 10 times, so that's 430 mana free damage.
