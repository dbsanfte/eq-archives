While the pets are different, the real difference is in the necro ability to
keep HP and Mana up.  The necro pet is always a warrior (except the 56? pet,
which is a rogue).  The mage pets are very versatile and have the ability to
root, stun or cause fire damage, and have differing abilities to take
damage.  Both necros and mages are good at soloing, so it really depends on
your play style.
