Never heard "miss con" before, but, to use your example, Dorn is
definitely an "under con".  While it is no doubt true that the xp
award for Dorn is based on his level, as is his "con", the difficulty
of killing him is _way_ beyond that of other mobs of his level.  He
hits maybe a little better than a "standard" warrior type of his level,
but his AC and resists are well beyond anything you would expect.  He
and other similarly deceptive mobs seem rather similar to PC twinks
(too bad they don't drop their "uber" gear when you kill them, heh).

At Dorn's level (low teens) most reasonably equipped characters will
expect to be able to solo an even con.  Probably the most useful thing
he does is to provide players with an early education on the danger of
relying solely on "con" to choose their targets, especially when soloing
a "named" mob.

Rygorr Centurions are pretty much "standard" warrior model mobs, which
are the easiest for a melee to solo, especially a Ranger who can snare,
dot, and bow kite to soften them up before melee.

I haven't fought many Shardwurms, but I once had a green once force me
to root and run.  They're tough for a melee to solo, but then so are
most caster mobs... I would expect a 47 ranger (the OP) to have learned
this lesson a long time ago.
