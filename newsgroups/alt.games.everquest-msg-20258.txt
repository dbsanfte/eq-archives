I knowingly petitioned a fellow guild member by the name of Eddymunster a
few months ago.  I hate cutesy names, and I certainly didn't like the fact
that he was wearing the same guild tag as me.  Unfortunately a GM didn't get
around to my petition, though someone else petitioned him only a few days
ago (changed guilds...unfortunately he came to my new guild <I'm one of 4
guild leaders, I know the other 3 IRL> because I decided that just 'cause
his primary is a halfling druid <too many people playing them have an IQ
under 70> I shouldn't hold it against him) and his name was changed. :)

In my old guild we had an idiot monk by the name of Ssadisst.  When I quit
the guild (because of him) I planned on petitioning his name but never got
around to it.  I mean, I'm not above petty stuff...I never said I was. ;)
His name was changed recently, too.  He posted his letter to Absor calling
the CS folks "nazis" and Absor's response saying the name clearly violated
the naming rules and he didn't appreciate the "nazi" reference, and that he
was close to receiving a suspension.

Ssadisst replied to Absor's mail using the same level of maturity any mail
with the word "nazi" has, and the subject line of his post was "I expect
I'll be on an EQ vacation for a week or so," and I do believe he was.
