At level 5, nowhere. No place in the entire game. Not a single one.

Platinum will not start rolling in for quite a few levels on mob kills
alone. At a mere level 5, you'll have to be more resourceful to make money.
Easiest way is to stack bat wings and bone chips and sell the stacks to high
level casters. You can make a few plat per stack that way.

You can also kill cats, wolves and bears (gasp! But he's a ranger!) and sell
the high quality ones to tailors. Can make some plat that way. You can also
hike to Freeport and make money baking.

Either way, take my word for it ... level 5 is very early to worry about
making plat with your first character. You won't have squat for a long time.
Tattered armor and leather will be the rule, not the exception. I think with
my first, I hit 10 plat in the bank at level 9 or so. Money just does not
come easy early on. Instead, fight, get faction, and most important, learn
the game and your character. Once you hit the double digits, you'll see your
money making increase.

Don't worry, it gets easier as you make more characters because you
understand how to maximize the early levels, even without twinking.
