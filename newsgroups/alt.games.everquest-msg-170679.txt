Info stolen off cleric board, where it was posted as stolen from
bard board.

The bard boards are probably the best place to talk about
specifics on these -- Here are a
                                    few clarifications and some
details about this new box that didn't make the main dev board
                                    post:

                                    * Yes, this *increases* the
total available effects that a person can have to 15 standard
                                    plus 6 short-duration, for a
potential total of 21 buffs.

                                    * These short duration
effects are temporary and are not saved when you zone. Since this

                                    is the case, we're not
putting too many things other than 3 tick bard songs in there at
the
                                    moment. Cleric DA and heals
over time will continue to route to the main box.

                                    The thinking here being that
anything with a potential to be a life-or-death effect should
                                    really last through zoning.

                                    Bard DA routes to the
temporary box for the moment - We may decide to move it back to
                                    the main one, but we'll see
how this plays out first.

                                    (Going to refer to effects
that route to the bard box as "temp effects" for now.)

                                    * Only beneficial songs
qualify as temp effects -- If a DoT is on you, you can't clear it
by
                                    zoning.

                                    * If you have all six temp
slots full, the seventh song to hit you will reroute to the main
                                    effect slots.

                                    One caveat here: If a temp
slot frees up, the seventh song (that now lives in the main
                                    box) will be refreshed in the
main box. The seventh effect will not automatically "pop" into
                                    the temporary effect box.

                                    * From the point of view of
Cancel Magic effects, these are effectively buff slots #16-21.

                                    * Yes, this means that a
single person can now be under the effect of 21 distinct bard
                                    songs at the same time. One
more thing that (for the moment) only bards can do -
                                    Overload someone with
effects. (Granted, it might take quite a few to do it, but hey -
It's
                                    kinda neat.

                                    * Yes, this feature will be
going to everyone. While there may well be features in the
                                    future that will be part of a
given expansion as the Raid window was, we have every
                                    intention of also continuing
a healthy schedule of live enhancements, as we've done a
                                    number of times over the past
year, and continue to do with this one and the new
                                    windowed mode. These will be
there for everyone to enjoy, and part of a person's normal
                                    subscription.

                                    Poxan the Gnomish Padawan
Coder did a really good job on the implementation for this one.
                                    No obvious brokenness
detected in the first run. No bards were harmed in the making of
                                    this window.

                                    Glad we're able to get this
one out where people can see it. Only sorry that it won't be
                                    going live before the new
year. In the meanwhile, please do feel free to check it out on
                                    Test and offer any /bug's and
/feedback's that you like.

                                    Happy Holidays!
