yes.  I liked that aspect of the game.  As I said in my last
follow-up.  I guess it's not for everyone.  It just what I prefer.
I can also see where many wouldn't like it.  I am always being asked
to make spells for other mages because the don't like research.
Maybe that's the real reason.  I'm in the minority on this.
