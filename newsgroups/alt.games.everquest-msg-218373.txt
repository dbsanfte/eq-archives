I'm not qualified to determine which genetic issues are serious and
which aren't.  I don't know you, but I'm fairly certain you're not
qualified to make that determination, either.

I'm not even sure why we've gone down this road; I merely made the
claim that some people with genetic issues have children knowing
fully well there is a good chance (often 50% or higher) that they'll
pass the genetic issue onto their offspring.

If it's a serious genetic issue, I think those parents have acted
irresponsibly.  That was the only point I was ever trying to make.
Do you deny that some parents do this?

Okay, you're talking about random mutations causing offspring to have
genetic issues even though the parents didn't.  First off, I certainly
hold no ill will towards those parents.  Why should I?  I was talking
about parents who *knowingly* act irresponsibly, not those whose children
get unlucky.  Why you've charged off in this direction, I don't know.
It doesn't have anything to do with the point I was making.  If you just
want to argue for the sake of arguing, say so, and I'll bow out of this
thread.

Secondly, your comment was sufficiently vague that your point wasn't
clear at all.  Sorry, but I don't blame myself for not understanding it
the first time.  I think your communication skills are a bit lacking.

My point was simple: parents with serious genetic issues that have
a non-trivial chance of passing it onto their children are acting
irresponsibly.  You want to nail me down on what issues are considered
serious, you want to expand the conversation to include children with
serious genetic issues that happened due to random mutation, you want
me to nail me down on a percentage risk that is acceptable vs. not
acceptable.

Sorry, but I don't want to play your silly games.  Qualified professionals
should make those determinations, not you or me.  All I know is that there
are parents out there with serious genetic issues who know their children
have a non-trivial chance of inheriting those genes, and those parents are
irresponsible for breeding.
