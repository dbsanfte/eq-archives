So does the prohibition of wearing mixed-fabric clothes (Lev.19:19), but 
Christians seem to happily ignore this one. That leads me to believe 
that the issue is not so much one of compliance with the Scriptures, but 
rather of the ineffable pleasure of forcing other people to live the way 
one feels they should.

Fair enough.

Those non-conservative Christians you speak of are allowing their voices 
to be drowned by the fundamentalists. You can't blame people for not 
even being aware of their existence if they won't speak up. Some of them *
are* speaking up now, on the Gene Robinson issue, for example, but the 
vociferous reactionaries much outnumber (or at least out-shout) them.

I can't speak for DT, but I don't think it's an issue with Christ as 
much as with Christians. *He* would be the most appalled by many of the 
people who pretend to follow his teaching.
