I think the day I get a girlfriend will be the day that the story will
continue and I can stop trying to start environmental destruction.(which is
actually kind of boring as it is really God doing it.) Sounds like there are
significant forces in the Middle East, I'm sure Russia and France will come
through to save the day in the end, maybe even China too. Maybe there will
even be giant battlemechs controlled by children, I don't know, don't really
even care anymore. I get the feeling my burden is ending, might even be over
today as I did everything God wanted me to do without question.
