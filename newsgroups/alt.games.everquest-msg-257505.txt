    You know why they put this system in, right? In part because of how
unbalanced PvP was, in part because so few people wanted to PvP on the Zeks
that they needed to give an incentive to do so. That should be the hint to
SOE to end this PvP experiment, wave goodbye to the PvP players, and end PvP
in EQ for good. No arena-flagged areas, no /duel command, no red servers.
Get rid of it all.

    Those are some pretty empty zones they picked. I wish they hadn't picked
Hollowshade Moor, though - no need to pick a wide open outdoor zone as
"underpopulated" when there's dungeons in the same level range that also
qualify. Echo what Lance said about the AE groups in Chardok - that could be
some amazing XP.

    The reason it's getting refunded is as follows. Touch of the Divine is
very much like Divine Intervention: upon death, it gives a (small) chance at
instead keeping the cleric alive, with a Divine Aura-like buff on them that
also acts as a heal over time. When the ability was first released with GoD,
it checked to save the cleric at low health (like DI does), and checked to
save the cleric when the killing blow was struck (unlike DI). Apparently the
low health check was not intended, so well after release it was removed,
drastically reducing the chance of the thing going off. Other complaints
about the AA have been that even after getting all six ticks of healing,
some players were still in low health aggro range when the invulnerability
buff dropped (hence the increased healing), and that if you had a DoT
greater in size than the HoT on you when this ability went off that you were
going to die anyways (hence the "remove detrimental effects" component being
added). For all five levels of the AA, you had to spend 60 AA points.

    I had level 2, for a total cost of 12 AA points. I won't be buying it
back. It's a total waste of points. "Saving" me at the cost of standing
around useless for several seconds, and this only happening at rare
intervals, isn't being "saved" at all. In most cases, it's a form of
torment, watching everyone die while you can do crap-all about it.

> - The necromancer AA Swarm of Decay has been refunded.

    The DPS was nerfed hard some time ago. This is a refund that should have
been done at that time, and is very late. In contrast, this was the first
opportunity to refund points for TotD since it's been changed.

    Here, shamans, have the only END regen effect in the game. Whoops, did
we say END? I doubt any shamans will be buying this back.

    Quality is job 1. How did that one even get through testing, since it's
been this way since release?

    This is actually an old item, but they forgot to mention it with the
last patch that changed the AA structure.

    Hey, my guild is in Tacvii. This is for me!

    This is very cool, and very nice timing. So far only three guilds had
even beat the first boss in the zone and gotten a lockout timer, so this
comes before the lockout timer becomes a huge issue. Nobody has beaten any
boss other than the first one, at least not yet. This is the true instancing
people wanted for Time.

> - Loot in Tacvi has been given a thorough audit.

    Again, almost none of the loot in the zone has dropped yet due to how
few times the first boss has been killed (let alone anything else). There
were some complaints that the bracers that dropped off the first boss didn't
have foci on them that were usefull for every class on them. Personally I
hope they didn't change the foci to blander, general foci - I'm not a fan of
generic items that are made to be OK for a bunch of classes, but not
exceptional for any of them. I hope they didn't change the mask off the
first boss - I'm really, really interested in that!

    And almost none of this will be noticed by anyone, as only the first
boss had been killed. For all we know the rest of the zone was unitemized.
Should be interesting to see if Zun'Muram in Txevu and/or PXK (first boss)
in Tacvii have been changed - this loot review could very well signal the
"opening" of the zone.

    Snip all the generic crap at the end, although the name thing looks
cool. Always hated big models with teeny tiny names.
