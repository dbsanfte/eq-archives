If you get a KVM switch, get good monitor cables.  It's easy to get ghosting
with KVM switches.  I tried cheap cables first, and they sucked.  I then got
a fancy shielded cable from a local store.  That was even WORSE!  Finally, I
said "screw this" and ordered the freaking cables that the manufacturer of
the KVM recommended--and they work great.

It can also help to cut down the refresh rate.  If you are running at, say,
100 Hz, but actually only need, say, 70 Hz to not see flicker, setting it to
75 Hz will look fine, and ghost a lot less.
