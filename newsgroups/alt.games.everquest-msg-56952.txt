Me too man, I know how probs like this can drive you nuts, lets break it
down and I"ll toss in some ideas as if it were my own box:

Nice Dell box, I see you're running ME but further on it looks like you did
update the DirectX layer beyond the 7.0 (or 7.1??) ME comes with.  Good call
=)

Question:  it *looks* like you've installed DirectX 8.0 - how exactly did
you do this upgrade?  I mean, downloaded it from microsoft.com/directx?,
windows update? from a game CD? or what?  Some of the library files seem a
bit old to me for it being 8.0...

For EQ and most games, I would suggest 16 bit color btw.  32 is cool and
all, but I don't even push my card like that and I have a 64MB Geforce2 GTS

I'm almost certain there are newer Nvidia drivers available than 8/2001.  I
know the ones for XP are newer than that I'm fairly sure.  You may want to
check Nvidia.com and see if there isn't something a bit fresher.

I also believe you can, either through Windows Update - get some WHQL
certified *newer* SB Live! drivers as Creative just recently released
drivers for XP and may have updated the other Win platform versions.  Not
sure on that.  I know to me, this looks like the stock MS/SB Live! driver.
Just a thought.  I know you said your display 'stutters' but always keep
that damned SB Live! updated.

No Everquest?  *sniff*  =)

Anyway, in summary, I'm thinking everything looks good, although personally
I would do the following, probably in this order:

1.)  Make sure you have THE LATEST and GREATEST flash/BIOS update for that
mainboard in your 4100.  I know mine shipped with version A04 and I'm at A10
not even a year later.  (support.dell.com)

2.)  Go get the downloadable-self installing DirectX 8.0a layer from
www.microsoft.com/directx/home (should get you to the home user
area/downloads) and install it.  Unless you've installed XP which has about
the freshest version available.

3.)  Get thee to nvidia.com and see if you can't find a WHQL certified (or
not) driver thats fresher than the one you're running.  (Looks like 2000
vintage and probably isn't the freshest from nvidia)

4.)  When you're bored, go get Creative's Liveware and install it (3.0 I
think?)  Remove the Dell Liveware/SB Live! stuff first then install
Creative's.  Plus, if you're doing this under XP, it's a *fact* Creative now
has XP drivers.

5.)  Run your windows update too.  Some little things like the fact that
just after release there was a "Pentium III fix" for XP for my system should
tell you to be sure and run Windows Update *completely* after installing
*any* Microsoft OS.

Good luck, let me know.
