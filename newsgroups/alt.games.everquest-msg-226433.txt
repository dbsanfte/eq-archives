You're using the warrior conversion rate, not the normal melee one.
Warriors get a class based bonus on hit points from stamina.

For a warrior, 1stamina = 6hp at level 60.  (6.5 at 65?  I don't know
exactly, as I had natural durability by then.)


Casters and priests, I believe it's more like 3 hp at 60, and 3.3? at 65.


I'm not sure what the exact rate is for rangers, but (4.5 hit points at 60?)
4.8 hit points at 65 per stamina, which you're now reporting, sounds like
it's in the right ballpark.


If you have any of the Natural Durability AA's, that'll change the
calculation as well, by adding 2, 5 or 10 percent.
