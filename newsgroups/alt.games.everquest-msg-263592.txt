This is in fact how EQ2 works, although I'm not sure how the timescales 
match. Debt decays *on its own* in real time and game time. If you're a 
hardcore player like me you'll want to work it off as soon as possible by 
gaining new experience one way or another. Yesterday we did Vermin's Snye 
and took on a nice little loop I learned a while ago between two named 
spawns with heavy guard. We marched down the sewers to the room on one of 
the zone and took out the PH's until the named popped (to me a double 
up-arrow blue) with his entourage of 3 guards. Challenging fight, but 
eminently doable (he dropped a nice set of chain leggings). Then we marched 
down to the other side of the zone and popped a named double up-arrow yellow 
with five guards. On the first and second attempts we wiped. With shared 
debt, that left all of us with two solid yellow bars of debt, it was pretty 
ugly and painful. I spent the rest of the evening and today grinding it away 
and finally cleared all my debt.

However, I also had the option of simply waiting it out and letting it wear 
off on its own. It's not speedy, it takes some 48-72 hours (even a lost 
shard will return after 72 hours RT), but again it provides that balance 
that works for both classes of players.
