Well , In reality thats a very low amount, you have to figure a lot
into the total cost.

Dir. and Producers. Get a big pay check.( for little work. all they do
is bitch about repairs on their BMW's)
Artist and Outside contrators 
Programmers
3D software
R&D
Coders
Clerical Employees, quite a few I'll tell ya.
Server Support MIS
Computer MIS
Servers
Server Upgrades
Computers
Computer Upgrade
Misc. Computer part i.e. Drives, burners (DVD and CD) ,
monitors,printers , laserphotocopiers etc.
Office Equipment i.e. Desks, lights , chairs, cubicals ( not cheap
mind you) 
Office Building Rent..Very Big CHUNK of cash goes out here every month
a little cheaper if Leased for the Year.
Power Bill..think about that one..
Employee cost..Crap that makes you happy at work like.. Micro wave
Popcorn, cases of soda ,etc.
Office Supplies...Pens, printer paper, legal pads,stick ems  etc.
Cleaning Crew.. let's not forget the guys that clean up the whole
building everynight.
Misc.   Toilet paper, paper towel, but this might be coverd in cost by
cleaning crew
Employee perks...Stupid crap you bring home that cost money like, Mugs
with company logo, pens with logo. t-shirts, hats. waterbottles.and
more stupid crap execs like.

And not to mention high loss due to employee thief. The biggest loss
is Blank CDs people take home for themseleves. They buy these by the
thousands and I mean dollars not  units. Employee thinks to
himself..hmmm I'll take a hundred blank cd's home they won't miss a
100, well about 200 assholes are thinking the same thing.
And Lets not forget security, sec. camera, key cards ( why do you
think they cost so must if you lose it) Parking security.
Busniess Tax, this and that Tax. everything tax.

Do you think this even comes close to under a million or do you think
Way over a million.

Thats why Pirated games cost the company so much money. If you make
one game and are hoping to just break even to make a name for yourself
and get funded for the next game and little Jimmy is making copies for
his friends and we all know Jimmy don't we.

And theres more company costs that I didn't list. But It is quite a
huge amount of $$ when your at the level Verant is at. 
Now just mutiply that cost by 4 ,when SWG, EQ2 and PlanetFall comes
out.
