Actually I did. However 'charmed' pets have never *vanished* when you 
invised so there were two legitimate interpretations:

1) The rules change *only* applied to summoned pets. (Which is in fact 
the case, fortunately.)

or

2) The rule change text was incomplete, and nobody considered charmed 
pets. And the inference is that if summoned pets are no longer 
*affected* by invis, than charmed pets aren't either.

Considering that a likely implementation of the mechanic is something 
along the lines of having an 'invisibled' event on the character that 
amongst other things fires an invisibled event on the pet, that self 
destructs the pet or breaks charm depending on the pet object type.

Obviously there are two ways of resolving this. Modifying the code of 
the invisibled event the of 'summoned pet' objects to not self destruct.

or 

Simply preventing the 'invisibled' event from firing into the pets at 
all, by removing the trigger from the character invisibled event.

Not surprisingly, these two options correspond to the 2 interpretations 
perfectly.

---

Fortunately it looks like they did option 1, the better choice. However, 
historically SOE has on numerous occasions made coding decisions that 
appear to coincide with #2 style practices.
