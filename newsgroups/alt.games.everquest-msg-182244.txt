Depends, are you soloing or grouping? Solo, Marus Seru by the Sanctus
Seru zone, unless you're an evil race. There should be a good pocket
far enough away from the guards there if you are evil, though. The
wanderers are a little more sparse by SS. Stonebrunt is actually
better than most people seem to beleive, just hard to get to. (Will be
easier when LoY comes out with ports directly there)

Grouping, there's Highkeep basement, LOIO and maybe Fronteir Mts.
There are others, just those are some off the top of my head.
