A quote (which I won't bother trying to replicate, due to bad memory) from
The West Wing always sticks out when I hear this kind of thing...

Japan has roughly the same population as the US, and they prohibit guns.
They have fewer shootings in a year than the US does in a day. Is it
because americans are innately more murderous, or is it because we have
access to the guns?
