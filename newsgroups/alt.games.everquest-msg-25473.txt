A little older, a little wiser...

This fur-footed halfling has travelled near and far on the path to
20th season. When last I wrote I had seen only a handful of lands. I
have now ventured onto the lost continent of Kunark and hunted in the
Overthere and Lake of Ill Omen. I have seen sights that have taken my
breath away. I have learned the folly of dying with my bind point four
zones away.

I now have a partner with whom I adventure whenever possible. She left
the Oasis to join me in Kunark and I look forward to exploring the
continent with her.

I have had many memorable moments, including:

(after coming ashore by the dock in Oasis)
"What the hell is that? Looks like a floating grim reaper with a nasty
looking scythe. Who cares...RUN AWAY!!!"

(after doing a favor for someone in OOT)
"You never said anything about a cyclops..."

(in the forest giant fort in Warsliks Woods)
"Please let me gate...please let me gate..."

I have learned many things in my travels, including:

1. Druids are really fun to play.
2. Grouping is MUCH more fun than solo.
3. Necros are really, really fun to group with.
4. Listen to that voice inside that's screaming "BAD IDEA BOSS!"
5. Learn to use the function keys to target your group mates.
6. A good puller is worth his or her weight in platinum.

I have two questions for those who've read this far.

QUESTION THE FIRST: at what point, if any, is it acceptable to scream
RUN! and bolt for the exit/zone/etc. ?

I have RUN! WE ARE IN TROUBLE! hotkeyed and have used it with lukewarm
results. Once I clicked it and started to run with Player A dead,
Player B facing a blue Orc and yours truly at 3 bubbles of health and
2 bubbles of mana, facing 2 mostly healthy orcs (one blue, one red).
Player B said "no". I stayed and died; he lived. Once I clicked RUN
when facing 3 orcs who were eating me for breakfast. I ran to the zone
exit and lived. The comment from the party: "Whittle ran." I feel
horribly guilty, but I was dead if I stayed.

I have Gate, which can sometimes be a get-out-of-death-free card. I am
extremely reluctant to use it because I feel I'm abandoning the party.

Thoughts?

QUESTION THE SECOND: at what point, if any, should I think about
joining a guild?

I have received three offers of guild membership so far. The first was
for a new race-specific guild in my home town. The second was a
drive-by. The third was for a guild that sounded somewhat interesting,
but was also a drive-by. None sounded really appealing.

Should I actively look for a guild? I like the thought of being in a
guild where we can help each other out, group together and have fun.
The friend who got me into EQ suggests I wait 'til higher level.

Comments are appreciated.
