How about considering another option - staying and seeing how it goes. Sure,
politely explain to the GL so-and-so is on your ignore list but unless they
are on the Ignore list for something REALLY objectionable, I doubt many can
remember why many individuals are there. If you can remeber, it may be
polite to warn the GL of your experiences with them eg if they ninja looted
or quit adv half way through with the loot, then request they are not made
ML.
Everyone deserves a second chance. If things go pear shaped because of it,
it just reaffirms your view and also gains the respect of the GL for at
least warning them. You may even be able to give the GL as a reference for
future adv  such as: Sorry but I cannot group with XXX because <insert
reason>. I have given them a chance and they repeated this <action> in a
group led by YYY. That way you have someone that could back you up and make
it less personal.

If the person still maintains to keep the ignored player despite your advice
then you are probably best to leave anyway. I would even make the
announcement in group chat to the effect 'I'm sorry but I cannot group with
XXX. I have explained my reasons to the GL' No one should think bad of it
and I would think it would arouse curiosity from the others, so much so you
may get asked why in /tell so they are aware of possible problems.

Might even be useful to use the EQ /note facility when you add someone to
the ignore list to remind you why you did it. Just thought of this so
haven't tried it yet :)
