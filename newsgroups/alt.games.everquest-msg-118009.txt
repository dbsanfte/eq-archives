I know how you feel there, whenever I return to Qeynos I feel the same
way...which is odd as my main is a Dark Elf.
In comparison to others mentioned (FoB for example) Qeynos area is lacking
but as you say, there is less competition there, a low level dungeon to get
train wise in and and decent money earners (Karana Bandits) on the downside
West Karana is the largest pre Kunark Zone in game and a mighty long run
with out SoW.

I levelled 8 - 22 from Qeynos before changing bind to High Keep.
