Yes it could.

No, here's how it could be read as an affirmative reply even
by people who are entirely familiar with the phrase "when hell
freezes over" -- consider a post like the following which could
have been made back when Verant removed the hybrid experience
penalty, after previously announcing that it would take
"divine intervention" for such a thing to occur:

    Yes, Verant finally decided that the hybrid experience
    penalty was unfair and removed it.

    In other news, hell froze over.

In that case, the "hell froze over" remark would be
a tongue-in-cheek remark about how the impossible had
actually come to pass (the first paragraph), and thus
now other impossible things are coming true as well.

"I now see pigs flying past my window" would be a similar
remark.

*That* is how Alexander's remark could have been read
as an actual "yes it has" response.
