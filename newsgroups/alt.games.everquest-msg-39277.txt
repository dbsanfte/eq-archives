So you're saying that the off hand is operating completely independent of the
primary?  I believe one of the assumptions of the original poster's theory was
that the check for dual wield skill was only made at the completion of the
primary swing. If the seond primary swing occurred before the off hand weapon
recycled, then there would be zero chance of it hitting.

I think you're talking about double attack skill in this part.

I do that a lot, but never noticed. I'll have to watch.

That part certainly makes sense.
