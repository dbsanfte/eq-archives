Correct, the specific example was replacement player tokens, cards, 
houses, hotels, currency from monopoly.

I -never- asserted they were repackaging them and selling them in any 
way that would be misleading. I did assert it was completely legal.

I think you got it right on the mark. If the reseller were to make new 
identical boxes he would be violating the trademarks etc on the boxes. 
However, he could put them in little plastic bags, and sell a 
replacement "Marvin Gardens", a 5-pack of little green plastic houses, 
or whatever. He can't -print- his own Marvin Garden's but he can sell 
any he comes to possess.
