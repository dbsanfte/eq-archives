Ok ok, you are right there, if you choose to do it, then by all means I
suppose it is your choice.

2. Names of religious, occult, or significant historic origin (e.g. Jesus,
Allah, Satan, Stalin).  Or e.g. Lokari a norse god of RELIGIOUS orgin.

4. Copyrighted or trademarked names of products, characters, services, or
concepts (e.g. Drizzt, Marlboro, Sony).

4. is a stretch, but there is a company out there named Lokari, they make
linings for Vehicles, though I am not the type to petition such silly things
I am sure there are people out there who would do so.
