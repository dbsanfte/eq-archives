Have you played a low-level untwinked character since the new changes
went into effect?

For me (after 2.5 years playing) 1-10 took about 5 hours on average
for 3 new untwinked toons. I knew where and what to hunt, and I knew
what items to collect to run newbie quests (repeatedly running some).
I would expect a completely new player to take at least 2-3 times
longer.  My 3 new toons are just as poor and ghetto equiped as my
first characters were at level 10 over 2 years ago. That's not handing
a toon thier epic at creation.

The real meat of EQ is the mid-levels. That is where classes gain
thier defining skills/spells, and when players learn their roles in
groups. Helping true newbies get a faster start (and encouraging
oldbies to start fresh without twinking or PLing) is a great change
for EQ, and will extend the life of the game.
