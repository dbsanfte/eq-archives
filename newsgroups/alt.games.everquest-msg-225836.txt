I disagree.  Take Wizards.  We are good at generating aggro, but we do not
want to get the mob's attention.  This makes it so that part of playing a
Wizard skillfully is making sure we don't generate too much aggro.  By
having Warriors be the best class to have aggro, but making it so the group
has to be careful to keep it there, the game is richer.
