A tank cannot solo very long at all. A Druid, Mage or Necromancer is best
for solo play but they will have a VERY hard time getting onto a group above
50.

I suggest you wait for Dark Age of Camelot (9 Oct) to come out.
They are 3 years newer than AC and seem to have made a very similar product
with 99% of the poor designes/problem areas of EQ fixed.
