I would recommend my own guild, Eldritch Circle, but we have a level 20 
limit for new recruits and don't really organise anything for people of 
your level (the few members that low are alts pretty much). However, you 
might try Wyrd Angles, I know they were started by Brits, have a wide 
spread of levels and organise events for the lower level folk - check out 
their website at wyrdangles.moonfruit.com

Alternatively, go to www.antonius-bayle.com (the AB EZBoard) and have a 
look at the guilds listing there - there are links to most of the AB 
guilds' websites, from where you can check out which may be suitable and 
which are huge uberguilds full of level 60s. The list doesn't say which are 
UK based but it does at least show whether English is their preferred 
language for guildchat, so it should give you some idea.
