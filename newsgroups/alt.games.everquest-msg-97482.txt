Sorry, no. I just wait to hear their arguments. By the way the only

You saying so does not make it so. Another unilateral declaration of
victory that is not supported by the evidence.

A convenient thing to declare. I gave my support as to why what they
said was incorrect. That support is still waiting to be shaken. Lots
of people after that started going "well its my opinion nyaa nyaa" but
that is, sorry to say, not the same as refuting the arguments.

Sorry Jazz. No bite. I haven't contradicted myself once. Nor have I

No, you haven't. You've screamed about leveling becoming too easy
without bothering to show how it will. Not easier, too easy.

If you are devolving to outright lies its starting to get a lot easier
to see who's losing ground here.

Not to break in here or anything but this is complete bullshit. You're
moving to extreme cases to try to prove your case and its yet another
sign of having nothing to stand on.

How does getting your corpse back erase all challenge to get to L11.
Waiting....

Your theory is that two of the dumbest annoyances in the game make it
appealing and addicting.

That is just outright retarded. I suggest you eat more brain food like
fish. If you went to the general population and told them the
spellbook was a great thing because it made the game harder you'd be
laughed out of the building. Hell levels are a bit more of a grey area
but I'll remind you if you have forgotten that the actual amount of
experience to get past them hasn't changed, its just been spread out
better. Easier and harder therefore aren't a part of the equation.

Still waiting on how removing them makes the game *too* easy. I'm
halfway through your post, Jazz, you didn't dodge it *again* did you?

Accomplishments are good. But they don't equal putting in retarded
things like the spellbook.

Sorry, the value of the spellbook is GROSSLY outweighed by its
irritation level. There isn't a soul alive who thinks the spellbook
was a good addition to EQ, beyond you apparently. There are a few who
think because they had to deal with it so should everyone else. I
reference you back to the selfishness part of the original post....

I might ask the same thing myself. I can't believe someone honestly
believes the dumbest decision ever made should be KEPT because THEY
had to go through it.

Welcome back to the selfishness argument. I thought everyone ran away
from that one....

The only answer that backs your statement up is to say you think the
spellbook was always a good idea. Otherwise you are just saying who
gives a crap about the lowbies, I had to deal with it so should they.
No matter how stupid it is.

Sorry. Wrong answer. And a pile of strawmen to boot. First off, the
learning curve doesn't vanish just because the leveling got faster
(and I note you have no idea how much faster it is). How many bugs do
you have to kill before its obvious what's going on? EQ players are
often derided as being dumb but I don't think we're THAT dumb. As for
learning them much later, well, there are other changes coming to
alleviate just those concerns - especially rezzes coming in much
earlier. This will be MUCH more valuable to the players than the
current state - players will learn to protect the cleric much earlier
than before. And in the end they would have learned those lessons the
exact same way anyways. So why not make earlier life easier, since the
current length of it serves no purpose? And remember... its not being
ELIMINATED, just made shorter. That's one of those slippery things
you've tried to dodge several times now....

Your answer has been given, I agree. It's just been refuted.

A clue free of charge. "Because its always been that way" is not a
valid answer. You have to prove that getting rid of them is worse than
having them, and because your rite of passage baloney has already been
cut apart and discarded, you haven't done that yet.

In case you can't remember the feeble rite of passage argument, it
dies when you are reminded that many earlier changes have already done
exactly what this patch will change and you reaped the benefits of it.
Do you miss the rite of passage that was represented by double penalty
deaths? How about pre-exp bonuses and pre-exp penalties?

Or we could dodge the answer once again. Still waiting....

Your *opinion* is duly noted. However since the actual effect does not
change the difficulty of the game as a whole, your opinion does not
support your argument that it makes the game too easy. It just removes
an irritation.


> Have I

Nope, you just keep repeated refuted arguments in the vain hope that
saying them over and over somehow removes the refutations.

Still waiting....

It's not being clearly answered at all. It's just backing up to
arguments that have ALREADY been eliminated. You're doing the usenet
equivalent of "NYAA NYAA I CAN'T HEEEEAAAAR YOU!"

Absurd. The idea that thte changes make things "TOO EASY" is YOUR
argument, and you still haven't shown how they create a negative
beyond "I had to do it as a rite of passage, so should they". Of
course, you think your broken and beaten arguments do just that, but
hey, I can only show you to the water, you have to drink it.

You're becoming tiresome. Your ignorance is starting to show limitless
bounds. If you didn't understand the analogy, admit it, don't try to
twist it into something else.

I'll spell it out for you in simple terms, since you understand little
else. If an annoyance serves no purpose but to annoy people, then any
benefit it could gain from making things harder is rendered useless.
The spellbook is an annoyance that serves no purpose - this is pretty
obvious to everyone but the densest of people (you). That's why they
are changing it. Most likely they know they never should have had it
in the first place. Most people besides the densest (you) could have
told them that; most people did. Some still are here in this thread,
but its not getting through to you.

/sigh

Just admit when you don't understand something. The example was a
clear one showing an annoyance that had no point. It said outright
total blackness, not the current state of the game. Capiche?

You dodged the question, or didn't have the brainspan to figure it
out, one of the two.

Funny, I don't see a lot of people disagreeing with me. Just you and
Lokari, actually. *cue bandwagon jumpers*

Your support for obviously flawed ideas is what kills you. To support
you people have to believe that the spellbook is a good thing. No one
does.

You have yet to show the actual consequences of this hypothetical
"dumbing down", which is of course a gross overreaction considering
the limited gameplay effect the changes give. Losing the spellbook
doesn't dumb down anything outside of your own mind. The L1-10 changes
do dumb it down a bit but not to any significant effect - L1-10
remember, its not like those levels will change the road to 60 any.

Slippery slope. Already shown to be false. If you're not going to
bother listening, its no wonder you still think the questions are
valid. You won't actually bother listening to anyone but yourself.
Closed mind again, eh?

A trend needs some support for the idea the trend will continue into
actual negative territory. None has been given. Still waiting....

It's not my fault you aren't intelligent enough to understand the
refutations. Try educating yourself.

Gee, the fact they're getting rid of it isn't enough for you? Back

That's correct, it was a part of the Vision and there were daily posts
everywhere about how it sucked. When Brad left the Vision went with
him.

But no one and I mean no one thought it was a good idea outside of the
VAK. And most of THEM were smart enough to avoid commenting on it.
Supporting it was just too obvious a way to throw your hat into the
fanboy crowd.

Still is, as a matter of fact.

The person in charge back then still believed in it. OVERWHELMING
hatred of it plus the competition having nothing like it backed him
down partway. It took getting rid of him to get it all the way down.

If you are seriously arguing that people wanted it let me just say
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA and my god get a clue.

Ever hear of correcting a mistake? This patch is all about correcting
the mistakes they have had foisted on them by the Vision. They had to
wait for the top dogs to leave, then Luclin had to be straightened
out. Once that was (mostly), we get the fixes.

Pretty simple concept. You'll probably still miss it though.

Oh there's people out there that like it. But they are the minority
and they are wrong, and they can be shown to be wrong, though of
course someone idiotic enough to like the spellbook isn't likely to
bow to logic.

It is a question of whether or not it affects you directly, or not.

It doesn't, it was merely a curiosity.

So, if we remove your spin, your main is a melee totally unaffected by
this. However you believe because it affects your twinks that gives
you the right to dictate terms of how future people, who have NOT gone
through it, should have to put up with long established to be idiotic
annoyances.

That's a marvelous display of selfishness there. And considering all
the benefits you'll get with your twinks not a lot of self awareness
either.

Because it was becoming obvious you are jealous that others won't have
to deal with the same things leveling up (the rite of passage as you
put it) that you did. This crap about dumbing down the game is just
that - crap. Its all about jealousy that others will have an easier
ride than you.

And it remains ironic that you would do it knowing that there were
exactly the same sort of changes before you started playing. I guess
those changes MUST have dumbed down the game too! After all, look at
the idiots playing it now....
