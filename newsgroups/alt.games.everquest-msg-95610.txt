Ok, bad mage doesn't equal bad pet.  My assist button is the most
used button on my first bank.  I always wait until the pull is in
camp, assist the MA - THEN send spike in.  If you're not sitting
when the pull comes in, and you keep the pet well back until you
send him in.  Chances of him aggroing on something are pretty slim.

Heck, I don't think earth is a good choice to solo either :-P
Now, it they'd just turn the root into a short snare ........
