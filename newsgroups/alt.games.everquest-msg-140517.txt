I don't find this behavior that odd.  He bought up an item that he
considered to be priced too low, and then tried to resell it at a
profit.  Makes sense, unless he is wrong about being able to sell it
at his higher price, in which case he may lose.

Now, what I found odd was the guy who bought out my stock of Lotus
Pies (10 for 200pp each).   This happened sometime when I was AFK, and
I checked the price of pies later and found the same fellow trying to
resell them for 159pp (underpricing somebody else who was selling for
160pp).

My theory there is that he only wanted to buy 1 of my pies, but bought
10 by mistake, and was just trying to get his cash back out.   At
least I hope that's what was going on, because "Buy low, sell lower"
is certainly a losing strategy.

I do the "buy low, sell high" trick occasionally, but I limit it to
certain items that have a high sell-to-vendor price.  Buy a Forest
Loop for 250pp and I know I can't take a loss on it because the vendor
will pay me 285pp.
