That's why I like my Cleric/Mage DB.  61 air gets aggro
fast, and stays with the mob with no intervention.  Only
way this could be better is if I'd had the patience to
complete my epic - they grab and hold aggro in a *HURRY*

Both chars having horses saves a lot of swapping from
comp to comp, since they don't get sit aggro.  Basically
I focus on one character while using a programmable key-
pad to control the other.
