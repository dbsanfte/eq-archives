Take note, everyone here who insists the game is not getting dumbed
down and that players are not getting worse.

THIS FELLOW IS ABOUT TO BE IN BOT!

There was a time when inexperience like this would keep a player from
ever getting out of Oasis.

I don't say this to bash the original poster. I'm sure he will get
better with more practice. But this is a mid50s wizard trying to get
access to a tier 3 zone, and these are newb mistakes you wouldn't see
out of place in Befallen or Unrest.

Scary. And even scarier is that there are people displaying as much
incompetence who are elementally flagged.

The skill level required to advance has gone to hell with mudflation
on equipment and the high level buffs on lowbies along with the vastly
increased leveling speed. Very very sad.
