One more comment. On that not liking somebody's name part. Yes, you
can petition a name just because you don't like it. But, nothing will
be done if the GM doesn't feel the name violates any of the set naming
rules. Also, if you make a habit of petitioning names you know full
well aren't in violation, YOU could end up with a warning for
/petition abuse. 3 warnings on your account, and you get suspended.
Continue to be a problem after a suspension, you risk being banned.
