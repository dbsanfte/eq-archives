oh, the complaining post....


i'm a 32 necro on the newbie server and for the last 20 levels i've had the 
same problem...

necros are too powerful




here's how i'm looking at this - on one hand, i want to be efficient .... i 
want my dot to last for however many ticks it's supposed to last for, i want 
to cast lifetaps in moments when i hurt mobs AND heal myself, and i want to 
never be full mana because that means i'm losing the mana i could be gaining 
if i weren't full mana ...


and on the other hand, if i wait till a mob (talking about in groups) is 90% 
or lower, so that i'm less likely to draw aggro by tick #3 or 4 of my dot, 
the dot won't last until the mob is dead, unless the mob is 4-5 lvls higher 
than my group....also, a lot of people are stupid and don't know how to 
exploit a necro's tricks (but this is an age old concern and i'm sure we 
sang the woes of this many times for many classes, and besides - necros have 
a reputation for soloing, so their song is muted anyway)


here's what i usually do when a mob is inc (talking about in groups) -

-wait for assist, other people to assist, or a time when my actions won't 
bother anyone, like a split second before the puller/tank has a chance to 
position themelf, but the mob is in position
-send pet
-cast biggest dot
-feign


i can't pull aggro because i'm feigned, i can't maximize my dps because i 
have to stay feigned, and the group assumes i'm doing nothing because dot 
damage isn't reported

it's BORING to just lay there feigned, but i do participate more in the 
conversation when i'm not twisting lots of dots onto our pulls

and i will always have enough mana left over to kill every single mob the 
puller can manage, even if the whole group wipes ... it's almost scary what 
can be done with even a premature necro arsenal

however

i'm being very efficient, except for having to blow 50 ish mana (i have a 
mana pres 1 item but i didn't do the math) on feign









am i doing something wrong?

is the issue that i'm used to the endgame where tanks can hold aggro and 
mobs have bunches of hp so we see the necro reapplying dots and all that?

is it that necros really ARE too powerful, that we need to be fighting reds 
to be efficient, and that dots are seriously the best damage "utility" in 
the game?

am i slumming when i group? should a necro be the lowest in his group (kind 
of a repeat of the above point, really), the way people don't flinch at a 
lvl 24 cleric in a group with a 29+ everything else? the tank should be 
above the group's average lvl, the mezzer should be also, and when the dps 
is, it's a good thing - but are necros an exception? it's not like we get 
new dots all the time ... i feel like i'll just switch my bread and butter 
dot spell once every decade up until new expansions are unlocked



so please, give me your thoughts ... i know a lot of classes have a "shock 
value" because we're used to the 60+ (the majority of us 70+) game, and 
seeing itemization, balancing, and non-expansion content effect the game has 
forced us to re-learn the game (a good thing, yes, but rogues really suck 
and wizards reap the benefit of a blatant coding error ... i'm sure you've 
heard of the 17 mana spell that does waves of 46 dmg rain .... and most 
melee is terrible and most casters are amazing)

was that always the way?



thank you, all =)
