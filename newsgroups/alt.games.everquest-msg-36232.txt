The guards have a very small aggro range. There are a couple of higher
level NPCs that will be KOS too though, such as Noclin Saah and Azzar
Habib if he's wandering around near there. Your best bet is to bind in
the entrance to Paineel in case you don't make it, then get a SoW and a
regular invis. Run right between the guards into the newbie garden and
don't stop, just head straight for the Warrens. The guards probably
won't aggro, but if they do, you should be able to zone without them
catching you.

Zone back out and get a bind outside the entrance to the Warrens.
