	He he ever see "The Crying Game" ? 

	Hey, here's a true story about gender bending stuff.


	I put myself through college driving a taxicab.  I used
to work nights both because I thought the tips were better and because
I usually had classes during the day.  I had regular customers, bartenders,
cooks, hookers, and other people who I'd see every night to and from
work or play. 

	One of my regulars was a *gorgeous* black woman, coffee colored
skin, and huge dark eyes...  She was slender and sensual and walked out
to the cab every night like a leopard , if a leopard could wear spike heels
and a strapless red dress.   I was in love or at least lust at first sight.

	And she was always so sweet to me, flirty and sexy without being
blatantly suggestive, joking, telling me about her night...  As we saw
more of each other she started to ask me upstairs to her place when I dropped
her off, but I always refused:  I was working and besides you never know
if it's all for real or a setup for a robbery or if her husband will come
home at 4:30, ya know?  But I sure thought about it.

	Well, one day I was in municipal court, something about failure
to yield or whatever, and who do I see sitting there in city jail orange
but my taxicab angel, only HE had a buzz cut and looked like he was
coming off a 3 day speed run...  There was no doubt though, and now
that I knew I could see HIM on the streets as well as HER.  


	But ya know, SHE was still every bit as sexy.  Reality is after
all a consensus of opinion, and I had no trouble treating them as two
different people, brother and sister maybe.  Would I have freaked if I'd
have accepted her offer ad found something surprising under that litle
red  dress?  Well, no, but it sure would have spoiled the moment.  I had
less trouble refusing her offers of extra special tips though :-)


	Here's a question for you:  if you meet someone online, and talk
and flirt and actually fall in love (which is kind of silly IMHO I mean
really, falling in love with patterns on a screen?  That's where Roxanne
went wrong ya know) but suppose you did.  Now that person turns out to
be living in a body of the "wrong" gender!  But wait!  You fell in love
with the person behind the patterns, right?  It's still the same person!
So...now what?


	It's all illusion, the dance of Maya.  Remember that and you'll never
be dissapointed in reality :-)
