Exactly.  My main is a 52 Druid.  I have to say I have had some nice stuff
given to me by higher ups early on.  I have since given back about 10 times
what I received just to keep the good feeling alive to newbie/lowbies.  The
one thing that really makes me regret helping is when what you give them
isn't enough and you get tells upon tells from them asking for more.  That
is my gripe.  I enjoy helping others..fact is..if I spent more time xp'ing
then helping I would probably be 60 by now..but I don't like to just be an
xp monger..the game is meant to be explored and enjoyed..if xp is your
fix..go for it ...I like to be in Norrath and have fun xp or not . =)  I do
not post much but will quickly say..that through alot of flaming there is
some really good advice here on this board. Thanks to those that I have
learned from. See you in Norrath.
