Since my point has evidently flown right over that thick head of yours *yet
again*, (and I know you're just spoiling for a fight - as usual AND I do
admire that fighting spirit btw) I'll try and aim straight between your
eyes.  YES the info is in the message headers - yes anyone inclined to will
seek it out.  This is alot different than going:

StanMannclone:  Oh! and don't think I don't see you sitting there at
127.0.0.1.  (In Maryland and on @home)

Buttheads who wouldn't have given it a second thought, now have an IP
sitting in front of them to fuck with at their leisure without having to be
bothered to look at some message header.  Not to mention crossposting to a
'hacker' group in the hopes of enlisting yet more *cough* hacking *cough*
help...hmmm?

LOL, you wouldn't admit I ever had a valid point if it jumped up and bit you
on the ass and asked for a doggie biscuit.

Bah, killfiles expire, OS's get reinstalled, read news here and there and at
work and at home.  You guys wear that KF like a badge of honor around
here...to me thats just a sign of someone with a closed mind - thus, whether
you *tried* to convince me of anything ever, or gave up, means all the same
to me - a hot, steamy, cup of jack squat.

Nice close.  Predictable of course but I don't think you've ever hid the
fact you like to close with a zinger.  So anyway kiddo, have you learned
anything in THIS exchange?  Ya know, like why it's fucked up to be posting
peoples' personal info into USENET NEWSGROUPS?  I mean look at this whole
bizbee/il28(whatever) thing thats going on.  That's the kind of garbage that
will ravage an otherwise interesting group to read when people don't say
stfu and enough of that.  Dig?
