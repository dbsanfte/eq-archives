No, of course it isn't. But that is entirely beside the point, unless
you happen to be one of those folks who think it's perfectly okay to
waste someone else's play time in order to save some of yours,
especially if you are a member of an "uber" guild. I am not one of those
people and, frankly, people possessing that attitude are the one thing I
hate most about EQ. The guild in question has a particularly bad
reputation on our server for just this kind of crap. Kill stealing is
against the rules as defined by Verant and is quite specifically listed
as a punishable offense. Period. GMs have an obligation to enforce those
rules, particularly when one of them actually witnesses the offense (as
happened here.) In this case, customer service dropped the ball big time
as far as I am concerned (which was, after all, what the original
discussion concerned.)
