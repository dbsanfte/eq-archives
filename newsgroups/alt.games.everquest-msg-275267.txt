The primary difference there being the fact that the author would be 
content to write his story, successful or not, whereas big business 
lives on the bottom line out of necessity.

Sounds reasonable to me.

I guess that depends on what the revamp entails. If it's just better 
graphics, then no, they are not equivalent.

I like the idea of revamping old content, though within reason. 
Seriously, like I said, how much time do you really expect to spend in 
the "new" Lavastorm Mountains? What effort is going to provide the 
better return on investment while still keeping the playerbase 
entertained as a whole?

I can certainly see why we don't see a lot more of it.
