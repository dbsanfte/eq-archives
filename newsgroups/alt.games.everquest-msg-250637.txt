Ahh, but they were very nice for the charming chanters, particularly for two
events that were pretty popular when I left:

1) BoT tower boss single group runs, clearing all bosses in an hour or two
using charmed mobs; and
2) Charming mountain pookas as primary DPS in vxed and tipt.

I used to do both of these regularly and everytime we went out, our chanters
would hit the Bazaar first to bring along at least three full sets of mage
weapons. I knew chanters who would get to Barindu and realize they didn't
have weapons, and turn around and go back to the Bazaar to pick some up
before continuing.
