It is generally considered common knowledge on any taunt-capable class
website that the taunt skill must be trained with at least one point for it
to begin raising.  I have proven this myself with multiple characters.

Hrm, which side should I believe ... the one that 99.9% of players seem to
agree with AND that matches my personal experience, or the ranting of a few
usenet malcontents (possibly suffering from drug-induced hallucinations)?
Tough call.

This reminds me of an argument a while back that Sense Heading can go up on
failures (it can't).  How some people can pay such little attention to the
advancement of their character is a mystery to me.  That's the only reason I
play.
