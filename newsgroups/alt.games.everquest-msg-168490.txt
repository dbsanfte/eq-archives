Listen, 'sweetheart' -

Many of us have been posting to Usenet groups long before there was such a
thing as HTML...  For your education, "THE INTERNET" is about way more than
web pages and HTML crap.  I can't begin to tell you how many times I've
heard people say "but how do I get on the Internet?!?"  When what they
really mean is "How do I surf the World Wide Web?"

Usenet was and is a place for exchange of knowledge and information.  It was
designed for TEXT messages.  Lots of people in the world have to pay by the
minute or by the byte (look it up) for their downloaded information, be it a
web-page, email, or newsgroup group.

Adding HTML adds a whole bunch of crap that must be downloaded and paid for
when not needed!

Further, many people manage to sucessfully utilize the internet all day
without the aid of a Microsoft product - many of which do not read and
process HTML.  Why?  because HTML messages can contain embedded scripts to
release viruses and because, in general, they believe MS products suck.

In order to read an HTML post, you've got to wade through all the HTML crap
to decipher the original request.

Lastly, standard accepted Netiquette for Usenet says: "Don't post HTML
messages."  yes, you can choose to ignore it, but it is just plain rude.

If you want your posts read and responded to politely, don't use HTML.

Now, climb down off of your Daddy's desk chair, finish your supper, wash
your mouth out with soap, and get to bed.  You've got school tomorrow.
