I linked to your answer since it was the most detailed.

I have a Q. about AA exp.  Will you gain it at the same speed at level 60
with AA exp. at 100% as you would at level 51 with AA exp at 100% for
killing the same mobs.

IE at 51 a Mobe would give say 2% level exp., But at lvl 60 i would have to
kill that mob 5 - 8 times to get the same 2%.  IS AA level dependent, Or
does the same value of exp. give the same AA points all the way through 60.
I ask because If it is level dependent, and YOu arn't realy a guild type
player you could get you AA points faster at 51 than at 60, but if it isn't
level dependent than you would be making AA points much faster at 60 than at
51 because of your new power's.

I hope I explained my Question in a way that everyone can follow.  Hope to
see a reply soon.

Thanks

a year. Hate all the little PK happy Prepubesent kiddies that run around
yelling Power level me" and if you don't they start trying to smack you
