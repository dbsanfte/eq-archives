My level 12 Necromancer did it a few months ago, as a kind of deathmarch 
when I got terminally bored with him (12 to 15 are kind of hell levels for 
a young necro... probably the gimpiest pet they get in their careers). 
Curiously enough, I didn't manage to get him killed, and now he's parked in 
Thurgadin too. No suicide option, though... I binded there. :/
