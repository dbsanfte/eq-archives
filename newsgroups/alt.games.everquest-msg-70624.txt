That's called "BIOS locking".  They have a special version of setup
that checks the BIOS for a string that identifies the computer as a
Dell.

I suspect that there is an easy way to get around it, because one of
the things on the Gateway support site is instructions if you are
trying to reinstall on a particular model and you get an error that
your version of Windows only runs on a Gateway.  They tell you to
start setup with two or three switches that are not mentioned in the
help message when you run "setup /?" to get a list of switches.  I
would not be surprised if one of those undocumented switches is the
"bypass the BIOS locking" switch. :-)
