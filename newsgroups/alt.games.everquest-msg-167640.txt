One of the cleric epic guides says:

"Once Ixiblat is taken care of you need to head into Chardok to kill
Overking Bathezid Di'Zok. "

When I read the descriptions of the epic I don't see any reason why I have
to kill him in order. It looks like I can kill him anytime I can get the
forces to bring him down. Heck, I could probably have done him first.

Is this true? I'd hate to go to all the trouble of killing him and then find
out he doesn't drop the singed scroll unless you've done something else
first.
