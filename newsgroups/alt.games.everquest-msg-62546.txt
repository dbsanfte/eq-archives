it will still be one old world leather graphic but it won't be the
SAME old world leather graphic as is on the old models. But yes, if
you have a shroud of nature, mithril runed tunic, leather bp, it will
STILL be all one graphic.

Is a good example of the SAME dressed models and how their armor looks
different on the new models. That is still an ogre in regular steel
plate but it looks a heck of a lot more detailed on the new model.
