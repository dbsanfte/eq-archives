   Well, we haven't broken out the fingerpaints yet, and I do feel like
it's nap time.  Can we at least have some milk and cookies?

   For my part, I try my very best to not hold grudges from thread to
thread.  For one thing, I simply don't have that good of a memory for that
sort of thing, so it's much easier to forgive and forget then than to try
to keep track of all the slights.  For another, well, I think it is
exceedingly tedious to bring an argument from one flame to another.

   I don't know how Ben feels on the subject however, so I can't really
answer your question fully.
