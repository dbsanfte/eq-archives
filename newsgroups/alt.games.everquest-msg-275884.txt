Ok, me again, another problem.

I can't seem to get the Prntscrn function to work to take a screenshot. I
thought maybe it was a problem with my keyboard so I tried another one and
it doesn't work either. It seems like a pretty simple straightforward way to
get a screenshot, so I don't understand what I could possibly be doing
wrong.

According to instructions you are supposed to hit the Printscreen button on
the keyboard and it's supposed to automatically take a screenshot and drop
the file into your main EQ directory. I understand that to be
ProgramFiles/Sony/EverquestII (right?) I'm looking, and there is nothing
there.

Anyplace else they might be?

I've tried searches, thinking maybe the program did something wierd with
them, but I'm finding no EQ*.jpg's anywhere.

Printscreen function???? The button has two things on it Printscreen/SysRq.
Printscreen is the top function, do I need to push something else to get the
top function? I've tried Alt, Ctrl and Shift, but none of those work.

Any suggestions?

Thanks
