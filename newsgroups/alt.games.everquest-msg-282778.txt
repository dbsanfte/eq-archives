Chanters without their newest mez can still mez in MPG, RCOD, all but
Nest DoN missions, as well as quite a few DoD missions/zones.  You have
limited usefulness only in the highest level zones.

Holy crap, are you serious?  You mean that until you get certain drops
you wont be as useful in some of the highest level content?

Unbelievable.  They do that to people?

I would rather try to get a rune drop for a chanter than try to gear up
a tank so that he can even attempt to tank in the highest level zones.
And in the mean time, you are still gonna get those high level groups
because sooner or later you are going to be the only slower LFG.  The
warrior with 8k unbuffed HP?  He is still going to be LFG in WoS, MPG,
DoN creators, etc.. because he hes less than limited utility.  he has
no utility.  He can't do a thing for those groups because he will be
out-DPSed by a dozen other classes LFG and he cannot tank.

Chanters whining that they aren't special?  Sorry, ya just aren't gonna
draw any tears from me.  You still get one-of-a-kind clarity and haste
spells.  You are the second best slower.  All this not to mention the
fact that you can still mez in good experience zones with good drops
that still sell well in the bazaar.  Dear god if this spell is that
important then just go get it.

Park your butt at any of several camps in RSS where greater runes rot
all the time.  Or by legos in Undershore.  Or hang out in MPG or RCOD
for a few weeks.
