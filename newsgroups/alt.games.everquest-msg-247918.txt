Had a hard time doing this myself.  I'm still working on trying to figure
out how agro kiting is done properly.  Most of my time trying to do this was
in Natimbi, as there's plenty of kiting room there.

Hmm - charming the bats.  Hadn't considered that.  I've mostly been near the
DSP zone-line in ME going after DBs with snare, fear, and rogue pet.

Very good suggestions on your posts here.  Thanks for the insight on the
other zones as well.
