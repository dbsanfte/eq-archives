I started a erudite Necro, and began wandering around Paineel, alot,
and then some more, and finally some more.

I am for the life of me unable to find the way to get to teleporter
'C' from the merchant/temple area. I have been able to get to the
observatory, the palace, and such, but I cannot find a way to use my
key to get to the other teleporter that shows up on the map.

Help!
