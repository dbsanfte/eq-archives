The death takes 100% of its penalty from regular xp, always. It ignores 
lxp, and aaxp completely.

As to losing AAs? No. It doesn't happen. However, I believe you lose the 
ability to -use- a completed AA until you re-ding if you lost a level, 
and the AA requires you have that level. I can't recall for sure... but 
it would seem an exploit to allow you to unding back down to level 20 on 
a pvp server but let you keep your 400 AAs...
