    I must agree with Lance here, friend.  I would still put Druids at a 10
for their travel and (because of your input and take) set Wizards at one
tick below them at 9.  Reason?  They still get to everywhere (except
Hate/Air, of course) faster.  Every Kunark and Velios zones are huge.
Adding that to the fact that you have to do _some_ running to get wherever
you have to go makes the Druids' abilities superior to "getting where you
have to go" --the definition of travel--.

    Whenever traveling with my Druid solo or taking a group, I keep Spirit
of the Wolf, Scale of the Wolf and Spirit of the Cheetah up.  If solo, you
can get anywhere faster than any Wizard can.  Add in their ports, and there
is no contest for any other class.

My 2cp,

-Grim
