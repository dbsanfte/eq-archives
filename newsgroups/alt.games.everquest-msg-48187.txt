I'm looking for a good multiplayer game, now that I've got the
bandwidth...is EQ for me?  What's the bad gamer to good gamer[1] ratio like?
Is it "safe" for a low-level character to walk around in, or are they viewed
largely as small change purses to be opened up, emptied out, and discarded
by high level characters?  Thanks in advance all.



[1] Subjective, I realize, but frankly entering a "game world" where
K1LL3R_DR1ZZT_W0LF, a hacked/cheat 3000th level character waits by the
"respawn" point for newbies to collect whatever belongings they have off of
their corpses while deriding the new players' lack of "SK1LLZ" makes me
wanna vomit...'sone reason I quit online gaming quite a while ago...
