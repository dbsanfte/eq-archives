Frankly, by your logic, the only expansion that's done anything more
than "expand what's already there" is SoL for the BST class. You've
casually dismissed all the new things I've pointed out, when they're
really the only new things that went beyond "expanding existing
content" that Kunark, Velious, and even PoP offered.
So are you saying all of those were disappointing as well?
