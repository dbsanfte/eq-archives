It seems a friend of mine, who plays a 55 rogue, might be quitting the
game and might also be giving his account to a friend. His friend
currently plays a level 13 paladin; I found out about this when his
friend logged in as the rogue briefly last night. My friend is going
to get his ass chewed thoroughly the next time I see him if he intends
to go through with this.
