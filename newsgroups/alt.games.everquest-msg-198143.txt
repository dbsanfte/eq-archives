SOE's initial announcement was no transfersfor 6 months.  Then
after a lot of feedback they changed that to "no transfers, but
we will reevaluate in 12 months".

Wrong.  That is only a small part of the appeal of a fresh server.
Any player with half a brain will realize that some of those people
will be as attracted to the new server as any others are.  Any
player who spends a little time with "/ all ## ##" will quickly
see that there is an enormous guild of punks two-boxing themselves
madly in an attempt to be the most "uber" guild on the server.
Even so the server population remains highest.

Not gonna happen.  And even if it did happen (_after_ 12 months) the
transferees would find all the groundthey hoped to sieze already
occupied by the local assholes.
