Greetings, Calmac:

I sincerely apologize for being so rude myself.  People have been very
insulting to me over this and I took you to be a heckler as well.

I just wanted to know if there's a resource that lists the keys and what
they go to.  I guess i'll just write the keys down, and where i got them,
and what they're for and hope i don't loose the paper.

Thank you,
Raven
