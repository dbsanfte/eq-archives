/ Rant on
  What was Sony thinking when they did the last patch ?
Illusions, why did they change them? all of our non-race illusions are now
worthless.   Don't get me wrong, I enjoy playing an Enchanter.    I used to
use illusions when going someplace with lots of wildlife( bears & wolfs)
,like in JPF.   Used to be able to get ambily with bears and indifferent to
griffs.   I can forget about solo XP'ing there. Best I can get now is
dubious with the bears ,and always threatening with the griffs. It just
makes it so hard to med & rest with everything after you. It just gets my
robe in such a bunch.

 I WANT MY ILLUSIONS BACK THE OLD WAY!!!!!
 so how does any other Enchanters, Druids or Rangers feel about this? maybe
we can start a petition if anyone feels the same that I do.

 Also how's this for a let down . I was testing my illusions outside of
Ak'Anon, my home town. I am a fellow Gnome that cons the guards outside as
Warmly. I cast Spirit Wolf, still con Warmly. Then cast one of the Elemental
Illusions, still Warmly.  Next I cast Orge, ok dubiously. Then I cast
DarkElf illusion. Now I con them at Amble.
WTF? Do Gnomes have a thing for DEs or could this be another patch screw up?

/Rant off
and yes I do know this is just a game. but you don't change the rules in the
middle of the game.
