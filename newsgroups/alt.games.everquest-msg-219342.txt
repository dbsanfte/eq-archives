Was having troubles with /assist hotkey or so I thought.  Turned out that
soe added the ` key as an alternate to F8 target nearest mob.  Since I had `
as attack it was causing me to switch mobs, often breaking mez.   I suppose
they did this to help noobs so they wouldnt have to reach so far for F8 but
I dunno, I wouldn't be reccommending use of target nearest mob myself.
