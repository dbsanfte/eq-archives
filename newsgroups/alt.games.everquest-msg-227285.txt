Once you learn the zone it is incredible and the XP bonus makes it a viable
soloing place for AAs even, if you go for the Ghouls near the Frenzied or
Ghoul Lord. Not great AA experience, but quite easy.

For a 35 Pally (assuming you are not KoS to normal Froggies) just clear the
first area of the undead end, from zone in from Upper Guk down to the bats
just after the bedroom. Just be careful of the wizards there and try to save
LoH for emergencies ;)

From then on you can move deeper as you feel more confident. Ass/sup is a
good place to camp if you can stagger the spawns (use to single pull then
wait) and some nice things drop in there (D.Elf illusion mask for rogues and
bards, a dagger with a nice proc, +15 str belt and a WR bag). Spawn time in
Lower Guk is around 26 minutes so in downtime you can either med or pull
from the corridoor below ass/sup. That is more for 40s though, perhaps.

www.eqatlas.com has a nice map for the zone
