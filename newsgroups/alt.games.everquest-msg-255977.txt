Hopefully you choose a guild that isn't full of assholes and idiots.

I'm probably showing my ignorance here considering I'm new to the game 
but I don't follow you. As a melee, which implies you're a tank, how can 
you really fight any creature in any position except the front? Even if 
you get behind the mob, since it is your job to get aggro, won't he just 
turn around and face you, meaning you're now attacking from the front? 
Or is your point that the melee should initially get behind the mob 
specifically so he can turn it around so its back is to the casters?

Just curious.
