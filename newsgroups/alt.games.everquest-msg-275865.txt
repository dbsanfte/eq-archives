Part of the problem is, unless there has been a change within a this past
year or so on basic spell research, that there was no set of research
combines that could raise the research skill to 200.  The research trade
skiller *must* use training points at the end to get to 200.

The hardest spell research for the Luclin spells capped out at like 180
to my memory.  The PoP research combines capped out at not much higher.
(My necro was a combine bot for a tradeskiller in guild who wanted to make
all kinds of odd crap from PoP that required necro combines for some silly
reason)
