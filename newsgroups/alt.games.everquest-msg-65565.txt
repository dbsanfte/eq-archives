No, you're right...  What I meant was compared to what they used to cost...
Computers nowdays are cheap as dirt...  No, the money we're spending is
certainly nothing to sneeze at and thank god for 4 year financing...  But
compared to just a few years ago, computers on the whole are much less
expensive...  hehe  Didn't mean to say that they were pocket change...  Bad
wording on my part...  :o)
