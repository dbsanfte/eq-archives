And this is more unfair somehow than say my ability to purchase a state of the art
computer with, oh say, a T3 line as opposed to another EQ subscriber having to play the
game with a Voodoo 2 on a Pentium 166 with a 28.8 connection?

Again..if you use this criteria, -everyone - has the same "opportunity" to purchase
these game enhancing items ( and the first computer described above would definitely
qualify as such) however they may not have the same resources which would enable them to
do so.

If you followed the "equality = affordability" argument (which opens a whole other can
of socialistic worms) to it's logical conclusion then Verant would have to ban every
account used by anyone who is running the program on a machine which is better than the
absolute minimum required to make the program run.

A program like EQmacros is no more unfair than using a tweaked out super-computer with
an insane bandwidth connection. What makes the program bannable (and problematic) is
that it helps negate some of the challenge (re: downtime generated) by the game itself,
thus Verant's opposition... and since they are both the owners and providers of the game
this gives them the absolute right to enforce their "Vision" by banning people for using
any program in relation to theirs which has the potential to reduce downtime and thus
Verant's revenues.

The key to this is..VERANT IS NOT FORCING YOU TO USE THEIR SERVICE! You either play the
game the way they want you to or you have 2 options

1. You are free to quit playing.

or

2. Start your own company, hire programmers and build your own system. No one is
stopping you from implementing your own ideas by entering into competition with them. If
you -really- know what you are talking about then you are free to try to prove it by
competing with them and besting their system in the free market.

Otherwise either play the game as they want you to or take option #1.
