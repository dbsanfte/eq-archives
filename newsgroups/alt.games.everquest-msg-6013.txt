I just wanted to find out how prevalent this idea is. I began playing
a month or two ago. I played for two weeks, creating characters and
then discarding them, before I settled on a magician that I wanted to
pursue. I got him to 12th level, before I moved on. I went through
another bout where I would create, play for a level, then discard
before I stuck with a dwarven cleric, which I got up to 7th level.
Another bout, and another character (Ogre warrior), that's up to 4th
level. All three of these are characters that I can already tell I'll
be playing for a long time to come. The Magician is for when I feel
like soloing. The Cleric is for when I feel like grouping, and the
Warrior is for when I really want to roleplay, regardless of what else
I actually do. I'll sometimes play one character for a few days in a
row. Other times I'll play all three in a night, sometimes more than
once. How many people do this? Or do most people get a character up
really high level before moving to another?
