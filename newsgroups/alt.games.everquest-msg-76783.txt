LOL.... DAOC looks like a glorified Diablo2.... can't imagine that EQ
will lose any of it's adult population to it..... Some in my guild play
it at times because it's solo oriented.... but still are very active in
EQ because there is so much more to do in EQ and EQ's so much more
complex.

Some of our members still play D2 now and then.... luckly... because
after 5 months of D2, I met someone in game that told me about EQ and I
left D2 in Dec 2000 for EQ and have never looked back. I'll be playing
EQ for the forseeable future.... I'm so much of an addict that I'm a
hydra in EQ now... LOL.

Last year, my oldest brother had been playing AC for over a year and was
very frustrated with it. I told him to check out EQ but he was
skepticial since he'd heard lots of bad reports about EQ on the AC
boards.... I strongly encouraged him to try it tho and he did.... and
soon found that what he'd heard had been false. Prolly from kids who
hate to group  and find EQ too complex and the higher level grouping
stratigies too complex.

Fact is, in EQ you can solo to around lv 15 with most clases. After that
only a few clases can solo higher, and of those most find soloing
really, really rough.... My 31 Druid can solo... but there's so much
down time that it totally sucks to solo. He can do sooooooooo much
better grouping. Grouping is great. However, if you're not a team
player, are a lone wolf, and hate sharing.... EQ is not for you.
