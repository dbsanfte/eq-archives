Gee and here I was all torqued off because after killing like 20 wisps I
finally got one (1, just 1) Greater Light Stone. Started walking back to my
med spot then WHAM the server crashes. Actually I knew I'd never see that
GLS again, so I wasn't really too upset.

Sorry for your loss.

PS. This is customer service just like everywhere else. If you are unhappy
with the response, you should escalate the issue. Call them and speak to
someone in RL. If the GM is snotty and does not address your concern, get
their name and complain to a supervisor. The squeeky wheel gets the grease
and all that.
