Generaly speaking most players think twice or more before taking a
necro or bard. Necro for obvious reasons, you can die soooo fast, Bard
because they are so dam difficult to kill. Guess SKs would fall into
that as well since so much is shared with a necro plus some very nice
armor. Personally think they should kill every person on PvP even
selling bone chips ). Druids fall into the middle of the pack although
they can be so flexible its hard to pin down a good plan of attack.
Best/Most prepared player will win hands down though unless luck
enters into it. 

Cant see starting anything other than bard, necro , sk on a pvp server
but thats just me, I picked a bard just to be able to bank once in a
while and live long enough to put the battle on my terms. LoL which is
almost always get the heck outa the necros way until hes busy with
some distraction like a random charmed hill giant ) Crude but you
"are" there to kill other players.
