I just think of it as "Sneak the hard way".

I don't think Verant would consider it an exploit -- they specifically
removed this behavior from a few key faction-quest NPCs (notably
Pandos Flintside in W.FP, who people were using to trivialize
faction-hits in Plane of Growth).

The fact that they changed a *few* NPCs to behave otherwise,
when they could have hit them *all*, signals to me that they don't
mind it for most quest NPCs.

And I do appreciate the fact that there's a way, albeit an
awkward one, to "bootstrap" a bad faction instead of being
totally "locked out" from ever gaining faction with certain
groups.
