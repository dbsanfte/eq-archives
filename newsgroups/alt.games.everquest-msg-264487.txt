Very nice and enjoyable write-up, Bob.  I think your posts here have
been more informative than almost anything I've read on the various
and sundry boards.

As for the last part though, if Adept III is so rare, is the
difference it makes noticeable enough to warrant the rarity?  Is it
similar to Training-DO-SO in CoH, or is there another dynamic at work?

And lastly, I take it Adept III is the highest you can make right now.
Do you need to go through the chain, or can I upgrade right to Master
III if I have it, for  example?

Thanks for the info, enjoy the game!
