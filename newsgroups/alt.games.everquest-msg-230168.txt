Sure you could do that, *I* just prefer to keep all skills up so dont have
to waste x amount of hours training a skill if a different type of weapon
drops.  They only need to be maxed once, then never worried about again.

I guess I just like not having to worry about what type of skill a weapon
requires when it drops, having to bag a good weapon in favour of a fast /
poor damage one to work on a neglected skill that should / could of been
raised easily 40-50 when all your skills are maxed (for a ranger that is
usually fear kiting time, so lots of oppotunity to raise all weapon skills).

Not having a 1H skill AND a 2H skill maxed, would be a bad thing, imo.

And I did say he didnt NEED 2hb, but there is no harm in raising it. :)

All I look at these days is the damage / delay of weapons, the type is
unimportant as I know I can use them all (and yes, there are some nice 2hb
out there). I use 2hb tanking, 1hs when using archery (for weapon stats,
vengeance etc).  I use whatever when meleeing (fayguard parrying dagger and
bladecatcher (piercing / 1hs) is a nice combo for the erm, interesting procs
:) ).
