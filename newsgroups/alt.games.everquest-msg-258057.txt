I imagine in cases of XP encounters they won't last more than 10 minutes,
if even that long.  Imagine your biggest overpull in EQ-L, with 5-6 mobs
in camp that you are trying to manage (that is assuming you *can* manage
it), and how long these battles have taken.  I don't think it would be too
much trouble for someone who has to leave to find a spot between these
encounters where they can skeedadle.

For raids, I think Winterfury pretty much said it.  It does seem a bit
harsh to have 2-3 hour long encounters where people cannot leave...and I
have to think that SOE *knows* people can get around it by yanking out
their internet connection. So I have to wonder if what they really means
is that even if you disband, the game behaves as if you haven't...ie, your
group cannot invite anyone to replace you, xp is distributed as if you
were there, and so on and so forth.
