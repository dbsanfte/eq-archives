For a while there, there was a command called /ftell that was SUPPOSE
to send a tell to everybody on your friends list.  It never actually
worked though, and it doesn't seem to be on the commands list anymore,
so I guess it's a moot point.

Or I could just be remembering it all wrong.  I'm old and the memory
isn't what it used to be.
