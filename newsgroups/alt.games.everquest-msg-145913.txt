By the way, the word your looking for I hope is "asocial", not "antisocial".
An anti social person has definate negative feelings and behaviour in their
social behaviour. An social person has a positive feelings and behaviour,
wheras an asocial person is just not interested in socialising at all.

A person who is not social is not automatically classed antisocial.

Besides, solo playing vs grouping preference is not the only indicator that
should be used to measure someones social outlook in the game. A career
soloist can be guilded, be active in various chats and actively contribute
positively to the "social economy" by generally having a friendly demeanour
and being helpful to other players.

Conversley, an entire guild of intricately teamworked active group
participators could all be labelled anti-social based upon their behaviour
displayed to those outside of their guild.

Makes the brain hurt thinking doesn't it? I know I wish I could turn it
off....
