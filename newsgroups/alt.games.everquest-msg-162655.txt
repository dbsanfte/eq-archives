Figure about 100 mobs per level.  So, you need about 800 kills, if you are
soloing.  800 kills in 2 weeks, or 400 kills/week.  So, with your current
playtime, that's 400 kills in about 40 hours of playtime, or 10 kills an
hour, or 1 kill every 6 minutes.

With your extra weekend time, suppose you can get 60 hours/week in.  Then
you only need 1 kill every 9 minutes.

I don't know enough about Monk soloing.  Is that feasible?
