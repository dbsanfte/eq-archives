Errr... When I was young, I didn't need help, or rather, if I needed 
help, I didn't get it. I started my first character on day one of 
release... There was *nobody* around to help. If a piss-poor player like 
me could make it without help back when the game was ten times harder, 
anybody can these days.

As I said in another post, I probably do five ports for karma for every 
one I do for money, and I cast SoW left, right and center, unasked 
(although I've been known to gleefully withhold it from jerks).

Having said that, I won't even contemplate hunting without KEI anymore, 
but I always pay good platinum for it.
