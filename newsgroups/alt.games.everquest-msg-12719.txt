My warrior buys SOW Potions all the time. I'd much rather do that, than
reduce myself to begging for SoWs. If there's a SoW capable guildie with
me, or in a group I am in, then I will definitely ask for one. Usually,
though, I just stick with the good ol' Blood of the Wolf potions. I've
never really bought any others, but I would be interested in buying the
potion that gates you to Halas some time. I'd also want to try the
shrink potion. It'd be nice to be able to get into those hard-to-reach
places. =) What server are you on? I could actually use another 10-dose
right about now.
