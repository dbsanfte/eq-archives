Argh... Don't make it so difficult for me to agree with you, dammit. :P

My point was in response to the assertion that "the US is not an empire 
in any way, shape or form". That poster must have been working under the 
literal definition of Empire as "a territory whose ruler takes the title 
of Emperor", under which neither the US nor the Soviet Union are empires.

Of course I agree that, as described above, both the US and the USSR are 
de facto empires. The core of my argument is that the foreign policies 
of the US and the USSR have been similar enough throughout the Cold War 
and beyond that either both richly deserve to be considered empires, or 
neither does.
