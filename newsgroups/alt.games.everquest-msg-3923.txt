I agree. I don't see why inspecting someone once would be considered rude. I
do not mind if someone inspects me without permission. If they then ask
about the items, I tell them the aren't for sale, and explain to them in
character who they can see or fight in which land to acquire their own. If
they bug me, that's what /ignore is for.

I do ask before inspecting others most of the time, simply because I know
most people see it as rude. I just don't get their point of view.
