Perhaps in your myopic view of the world.  To the rest of us who don't
choose to belabor what *should* be understandable syntax to anyone who
actually plays the game, caster, priest and fighter are the breakdown of
classes.  And when said in that manner, "caster, priest and fighter," if you
seriously do not understand, there is some other problem.  To anyone who has
a fungi tunic or has the ability to look at a fungi tunic (that's everyone
here and in the game), and who has read the thread up to this point, the
meaning was clear.  Your syntax games are quite amusing, totally off the
point, and irrelevant.  Particularly when you make an entire post playing
such a syntax game with the answer and clarifying wording for anyone who
wasn't familiar with the fungi tunic included in the part you quoted.
