When I first started to play EQ I tried a War too, I hated it. So then I
tried a Druid and loved it. Its the casting side witha bit of combat thrown
in that I like. He might just not like the class. Also let him know the
first 4 lvls are just to get used to the game after that ya can start
grouping and start getting better quicker. Have an aim, what do you want to
do today. Look at some quests, explore more.

But get him to try some more classes. And start a char and join in with him.
