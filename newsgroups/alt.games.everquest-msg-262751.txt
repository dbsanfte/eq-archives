	His AOE range is 150.  Have all the healers stand at 175 and
spam the tank with Remedy type fast heals.  If the tank dies you *will*
wipe cause once this guys gets to the casters they go down in a few
clicks, and he only has to move closer than 151 to them :-)

	His AOE can be removed by annul magic etc. but by the time he's
hitting you with it it's over anyway...  It seems like you'd have plenty
of time to run away while he chases down the other folks but he always 
seems to catch up.
