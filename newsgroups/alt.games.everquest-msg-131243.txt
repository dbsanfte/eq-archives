Actually the modern definition is the same. Agnostic means, more or
less, and has always meant as far as I know

"God may or may not exist, it doesn't matter either way."

That is what an agnostic is, someone who believes that. An athiest, by
contrast, means someone who DOES NOT believe that there is a god. I
never got theist straight, I think theist is someone who believes
there is a god but does not label him into the Judeo/Christian/islamic
box? 

Even an athiest might say that it is unproveable whether or not god
exists, however as an athiest HE does not believe that god exists. If
he belives that god MIGHT exist then he instantly is no longer an
athiest but rather an agnostic. There are a lot fewer athiests then
you think and probably a lot of people who think they are athiests but
are actually agnostic.

"Does god exist?" Posed as a question to an athiest and an agnostic:

Athiest:  "no, there is no god"

Agnostic: "I don't know there could possibly be a god but nothing 
different happens if I believe in him or that he is a particular type
of god, even if I'm right in what I might someday come to believe or
if someone else is right in what they believe."
