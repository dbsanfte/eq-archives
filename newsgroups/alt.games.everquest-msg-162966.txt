True...it's possible that food is consumed slower in NRo and Oasis. :-)

Sitting down and timing is not required to see that food/water consumption
is zone dependent.  When I was low level, I used to pretty much always leave
town with two stacks of muffins and two stacks of milk.  If I spent no time
in deserts, when I ran out of one, the other would be pretty low, too.  If I
spent a lot of time in Oasis, I'd run out of milk while I still had a lot of
muffins left.
