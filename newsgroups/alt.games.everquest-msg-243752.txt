Actually, one of the things he mentioned got me wondering (entirely
independent of any point he may have intended, of course.)

How likely to you think it is that SOE has simply looked into the idea of
buying out IGE just to get rid of them?  Think they've ever analyzed the
profit-loss in both monetary terms and in credibility terms of such an
action?

Sony applies certain leverages they have over IGE to lower the value of
their company,  (do they even have subsidiaries selling items in the
individual games or is it one large operation?) then buy them (or their EQ
operation) out and eat the loss.

Extremely doubtful they'd ever do such a thing, because they'd probably lose
millions and a replacement company would probably spring up in under 2
years, but I wonder if they've ever looked into it as a possibility.

As for the original message in this thread, I'd bet it was IGE who
approached SOE about a partnership.  Hell, they've approached every other
Everquest related entity in an attempt to form a partnership.  Why not SOE?
