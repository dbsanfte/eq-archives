That's incorrect.  Bush Sr. didn't "finish the job" for two reasons:

1. There was no viable exit strategy.  This came right from Bush Sr.
   himself.  Or do you think he lies as much as his son Bush Jr.
   does?

2. He expected the Kurds to finish the job, but failed to supply them
   properly to do just that.

The UN had nothing to do with Bush Sr. not "finishing the job" in the
Gulf War.

This whole "democrats do whatever the UN wants" is sheer and utter
nonsense.  Smoke and mirrors.  Hand waving by the republican
propaganda machine to sucker voters into voting republican.  When you
don't have a real record to stand on, you pretend your opposition will
somehow be weak.  Frighten them with "the UN is going to take over!".
The saddest kind of "the sky is falling!" argument there is.  What's
even sadder is people buy that load of nonsense.

That's incorrect.  Allowing the UN another 6 or even 12 months to try
to work something out wouldn't have made beans worth of difference.

You can say the invasion was justified as many times as you like, and
since it's not true, you'll never be able to truly justify it.  There
were bigger fish to fry when Bush Jr. decided to invade Iraq.  It's no
secret that the Bush administration was looking for an excuse to
invade Iraq.  It's an insult to all the innocent lives lost on 9/11
that the Bush administration leveraged such a tragedy in order to wage
their unjustified war on Iraq.  The Bush administration is one of the
most immoral and unethical administrations the United States has ever
seen.

Yes, of course, just wave away any evidence presented to you.  What's
the point of continuing if you won't even acknowledge what's right in
front of your face?

Sorry, but you've got me pegged wrong.  I'm not a Christian.  I just
like to point out to Christians the evil, anti-Christian person
they're going to vote into presidency again.  Sometimes you have to
pound home the evil, anti-Christian things Bush has done again and
again and again to get the point across to them.  I'm not suggesting
you're a Christian, but I'm sure plenty readers of this thread are.
