Wow, thanks for the reply.  Regarding the FSCS, my impression was that SOE
miscalculated badly.  The original idea was that there would only be few
Jedi relative to the character population and most people would be more than
happy to grind away at their professions and if they opened the Force slot,
that was gravy.  Instead,  as you said, opening that slot is the primary
goal of most players.  SOE miscalculated big on the issue and I guess it
makes me wonder whether they did any market research at all.  They seem,
more than ever, a company that builds games but does not play them.  I think
they are trying to introduce the idea of a "Player Crafted" driven economy
in EQ2 and it scares me.
