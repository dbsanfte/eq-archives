I don't know. I don't *have* to know, it's not my day job. The issue is 
how Iraq, which was not a threat, was handled.

I don't have to prove a negative, but the CIA themselves seem certain 
enough...

As for Saddam's relationship with Bin Laden, Rumsfeld himself seems to 
have all but given up on the charade.

> Iraq is now the ultimate terrorist training and recruitment ground?

Where else now do terrorists get combat experience against real American 
troops, *and* a pool of tens of thousands of people who now have a 
grudge against America borne not out of some abstract support for Israel, 
but out of seeing their own loved ones killed? Perhaps in Afghanistan, 
but to a much lesser extent, and besides, nobody here (not me, at any 
rate) questions the legitimacy of the Afghanistan campaign.

> So you say.  The facts do not agree.

I think that the only incontestable fact is that there's some very 
wealthy people in the US and allied countries becoming wealthier every 
day the war in Iraq drags on.
