because if you have 20 clerics but not many happen to be on right now you
happen to be screwed. You take what you can get and if that means a twinky
cleric gets in the cheal rotation you live with it. It is common for each of
us to have several difrent characters on the same or diffrent accounts ,
these secondary characters oddly enough see use even.

And the luck is in catching it when for some reason of lagg or any other
reason it is far past too late for when the cheal should have gone off. This
happpens fairly often. Hell we tend to screw up and let the flurry drakes in
ntov eat 3 or 4 tanks before they get slowed because we are not exactly
paying attention to the small stuff and several key people go afk.
