    As long as they don't stay there. =) Right now HoH is the crowded
hellhole, because Spectral Parchments drop there. I'm not flagged for HoH,
so I couldn't go if I wanted - but I don't want to because I love the plane
I'm in now. I've never seen more than two groups in my current home, there's
the odd named drop (I have the earring and ring I picked up there on my
Magelo), and the XP is as good as anywhere else. A few people from the other
guild that has access have zoned in, but they soon find out there's no
Spectrals and nobody milling around LFG and they go back to HoH. Which is
exactly where I want them, out of my hair.
