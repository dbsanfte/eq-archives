Well first off, having FP at 25 is a very nice accomplishment. However,
it is utter BS that "in order to advance further, you need better
armor". My SK is 35 at the moment, and I am gradually replacing the fine
plate armor with darkforge as I complete the quests. But I certainly got
to 35 in my fine plate just fine...

It's an SK rite of passage to park your butt in Cazic Thule and quest
for your darkforge armor. Plus, it's a great dungeon with great exp and
good loot, if you can get in a good group. I came at 25, and it was
deserted. Came back at 30, still deserted. Finally came back at 35 and
have joined up with a 39 shaman, and we can easily duo the archon temple
(a good place to get the pieces you need for your armor). Hopefully it
is more crowded on your server, or you can bring a group of friends.

probably not.

 Not by a long shot. Hope you have been keeping up your other weapon
skills; if not, get a good shield and some FS piercers and 1hb and try
to get your skill up. There are some nice SK only weapons out there now;
I bought a stalag terror spine (15/34 piercer) cheaply around level 25
that was my main damage dealing weapon for bashing, with dark reaver as
my 2hs. At 33, some kind soul sold me a Mace of the Shadowed Soul (19/29
+10 int 1hb) for 1100pp (all my money) and my dark reaver. I would
recommend keeping all your skills maxed, and try to save up for one
really nice 2-hander and one really nice one-hander, and a good shield.
A small race SK with a stalag terror spear or MoSS and a shield is
dishing out as much if not more damage than a similar SK wielding a
low/mid end 2hs, but can bash and interrupt casters. I can't tell you
how annoying it is to group with a bunch of human/erudite/de/iksar SKs
who only use 2hs, then wonder why the fights against the cleric lizards
are taking so long...
