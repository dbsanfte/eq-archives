I think I've mentioned elsewhere that I'm not really impressed with the TSS 
expansion. Actually, the new zones look great, and I haven't tried any of 
the new quests and such, but I am just completely turned off by the Drakkin 
models. Let's just say that I just find them very un-EQ-like and clumsy - 
not to mention the fact that those facial spikes look like stick-on 
Halloween props.

Anyway, I'm curious why they are trying to funnel everyone into the TSS 
zones from character creation. I can understand that they want people to 
experience the new content, but should that really be at the expense of the 
old? As a new dark elf, I *want* to visit Neriak. As a new barbarian, I 
*want* to visit Halas. Instead, the tutorial sends the new player either to 
the new TSS zone or PoK, the latter only if the player knows to speak to 
Arias again instead of exiting through the tunnel. I just can't fathom why 
they would want to detract from one of their biggest draws - their plethora 
of various game world zones - just to sell people on the new content. It 
almost seems like they are deliberately trying to phase out the old zones.

The home cities are/were great. I just can't imagine someone could possibly 
be sitting in meetings suggesting that they be eliminated or rendered 
obsolete, perhaps just so that EQ is viewed as more current from a 
graphical perspective. Although, I must say, the way so many people belly-
ache everytime they re-vamp an old world zone, I find it increasingly hard 
to blame them.

SoE: "Enjoy the re-vamped Freeport!"
Customer: "OMFG!!1! This suxx0rz!!! It's 2 different. B000!!!1!!1!"
