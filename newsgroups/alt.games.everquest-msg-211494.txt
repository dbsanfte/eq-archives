I'm going to assume you are male.  Do you refuse to accept or give oral sex,
on the grounds that it cannot lead to reproduction?

Do you refuse to wear a condom, and refuse to have sex with women who are
using any form of birth control?  Do you avoid sex at times during the
woman's cycle when you are sure she won't get pregnant?

In fact, we can go further...do you do ANYTHING that is not connected with
either reproduction, or with indirectly aiding reproduction?  For example,
what about EQ.  EQ does not aid reproduction, so how do you justify it.  If
it is OK for you to entertain yourself playing EQ, why is it not OK for
homosexuals to entertain themselves with homosexual sex?

And the basis of this belief is what?  How do you rule out the possibility
that a gene for homosexuality does not have survival value?  (And don't
answer with something stupid, like such a gene would quickly breed
out).
