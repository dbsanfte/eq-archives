Forget price guide sites. The right price is whatever people are willing to 
pay for an item _at your server_. Out of the listed weapons, Tombcarver is 
the best and should be wielded in main hand, with Needlite Stinger at offhand.
If the stats of that mining pick are really only 4 damage at 29 delay, you
should sell it ASAP, and not expect to get 440 pp for it either. Maybe if
you meant 14 damage at 29 delay - then it's a pretty decent 2h weapon for
teen levels, but dual-wielding the others would still get you more benefit.

You can compare weapons by dividing their damage to their delay and see which
weapon gets the better ratio. If equal, then faster weapons are better.
At higher levels (25+), you should put a faster weapon in your main hand and
a better ratio weapon to your offhand, because you'll be getting a damage
bonus added to each hit of your mainhand weapon, and faster-hitting weapons
would be improved more.

: Lastly, what would be a good armor for me at a moderate cost?  Weight is an
: issue because I am not that strong.

Probably banded armor, made by player blacksmiths, sold for 1 pp per ac point.

You *should* be strong, however, since strength affects damage output, which
is what rogues do in groups -- damage.

: PS. In the game last night someone was auctioning one of these picks.  I
: asked about the price because I wanted to know the value of my weapon.  He
: said he was starting the bidding at 600pp.  When I suggested that it was a

: description that says that.  I didn't know there was such a thing as two
: handed piercing.

There are two handed piercing weapons, but they use the same Piercing skill
as 1h piercers, unlike slashing and blunt weapons.

: Also, I have seen a lot of debate over which hand should have the faster
: weapon and I really don't understand the arguments. Help!

Main hand should have the faster weapon.
