I don't know if all the "cyclops" are that way, but they're all pretty
tough.  I do know for a fact that the easiest giant in the OOT, Gornit,
drops every type of giant/cyclops toe, and he's a fast respawn in a
fixed location, so he'd be the best one to go after.  He often drops
a lot of cash, too.
