I would recommend *not* being a bard as a first character.  Bards and
Enchanters can be pretty difficult.  I would recommend being melee or some
type of hybrid like a pally or ranger.  A hybrid of those types will help
you acclimate to both the melee and casting aspects of the game.

Whatever you choose....Have fun!
