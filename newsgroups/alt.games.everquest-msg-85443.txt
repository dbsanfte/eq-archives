Oh, forgot about this one.  My CHA at 56 hovers around 140 without buff, and
that tends to work fine in most situations.  Any time critters hit hard I do
crank that baby up to 200 or more though. <g>  My normal INT is around
210...with CHA gear but no INT buff it drops to about 190.

Not sure why you'd CHA necros unless they were going to charm
undead...doesn't affect Fear at all.
