I'm trying to figure out some facts here. On Morden Rasp, the premium
destination for LDoN adventures seems to be Butcherblock. At any of the
other camps you may see 4 or 5 people or perhaps one full group at a time,
at the Butcher Block location there are as many as 25 to 30 people everytime
I come around.

Now the location of the LDON dungeons have the longest travel time out of
all of them. From the East Commonlands, North Ro and South Ro locations
travel times to the dungeons is much shorther. Everfrost is probably the
easiest to travel to the ldon dungeon as it is in the same zone.

So it isn't travel.

I have asked around on the server as to why people want to do LDoN in
Butcherblock. Most people actually ignore the question. They don't know.
They just go because other ask em to go to BB. No mind of their own :)

Others say things like "Its the easiest out of all of them", or.... "BB
gives best experience" and even "because the loot here is better".

Is there anyone here that has some FACTS about which dungeon is the
best/worst and why? Bottom line is, why does everyone goes to BB?
