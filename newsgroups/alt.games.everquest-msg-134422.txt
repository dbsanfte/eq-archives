You're right, in that it doesn't change to much for a high-end druid.  But
there are a couple of bumps in the road between getting Lightning Strike at
34 and Lightning Blast at 49 where a druid gets a bit stuck ... the Forest
Giants in FV are greening out, but you don't have enough mana in the tank to
effectively quad spirocs yet.  Those are the times to work on root/dotting
(well, I guess it doesn't have to be 'root/dotting' anymore), and those are
the times that this change will affect a soloing druid.

Root/dotting IG's at 44 was pretty stressfull ... if the big blue guy broke
root, you didn't have enough mana for that last Drifting Death it was now
going to take to finish him off with the reduction in damage that came from
him not being rooted. Now that shouldn't be much of an issue.  Just let him
chase your little puppy butt all he wants to once you get that last dot off
... no need to sit and med for that last 'just in case' dot.

Probably has a bigger positive effect on grouping shammies, though.  Full
dots, all the time.
