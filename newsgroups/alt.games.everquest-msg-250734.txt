I started playing City of Heroes because I was not happy with EQ.  The buggy
content of Uqua really made me burn out.  We're not quite there, but we are
almost.  Forsaken Realm got through Uqua on the 10th.  Sadly, I think it was
the departure of Afterlife on my server (mithaniel marr) that prompted the
devs to really look.

I disliked CoH after my little defender (cleric) hit 23.  I just couldn't
stand it anymore.  It was so boring.  Moved on to Lineage 2 w/ my husband
and his friends...i just got sick of that as well and the chat interface is
one of the crappiest interfaces I've ever seen.  The one thing I liked about
CoH was their map system...thank god!  I truly appreciated that I could
customize my character so that no one really looked alike - very cool.  But
I just couldn't get into the whole super hero thing.  oh well.

What did playing CoH and L2 make me do?  Fully appreciate EQ - so much so
that I'm back and raiding with my guild.  I'm fully embracing AAxping and
even *gasp* raiding Uqua.  I'm still pissed at SoE for making me buy LoY for
the lame ass dyes and a shared bank space.  That should have just been
released as a patch and we should not have had to buy it.  But I'm even more
pissed that we just got GoD and now they're releasing OoW?  Great...more
buggy content that we will have to sift through.  But honestly, two
expansions in less than a year that we have to pay for?  Total bullshit.
I'm complaining, yes.  But in the end, when EQ dies, I will go along with
it.  EQ will be my first and last MMORPG.

When they did the EQ summit, they invited Thott and Hobben (the heads of
<Afterlife>) to it...and they both declined, citing it was too little too
late.  How sad that SoE couldn't fix that.

A friend is in WoW beta and is gonna show us that tomorrow, well,
today...he's loving it.  I have heard that WoW beta is great - I'll have to
see for myself.  :)
