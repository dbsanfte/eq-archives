Actually, I think we're up to seven that farm sleepers now, but I'd have
to double check. And yes, Ben is right. It's FFA but the top guilds do
seem to work together (at least for appearances and where possible) to
keep the peace. And the sleeper remaining asleep was a joint decision.

No. Work picke up after that. But I considered it, just for a joke.
Could have been amusing.

Of course, I can't put words in Ben' mouth or read his mind as to what
he meant by "better". I'd say they do fine given the environment. Xev,
even given the fact that it's a split server, is a much younger server
than some of the ancient ones where the huge ubahguilds evolved. It
hasn't had as much time to "gell" at the top levels as servers like
Karana and company. 

Also, while it's hardly unique to ours, or even rare, we seem to watch a
repeated history of the guilds who do manage to make it up to the
highest levels shattering at various points and having to do some
rebuilding. But as I said, that's hardly unusual on any server.

Most of everything that gets accomplished by top guilds on other servers
seems to happen on Xev, just a bit later is all. Also, it may be a
matter of the competitive environment. Because we have so few guilds
(compared to some older servers) capable of the very top end stuff,
there's no feeling of a "race" to get there? That's just speculation, of
course.

Take a look at Harm's site. *shrug*. Judge for yourself. I guess I just
never really noticed because it was part of the world where I "grew up".
Never bothered me one way or the other.

I dont' think you are. Again, and this is only speculation, maybe you
guys are racing the competition and they don't have to?
