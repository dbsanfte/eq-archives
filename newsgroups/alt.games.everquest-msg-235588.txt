What I find interesting is that just before the release of GoD,
someone asked at the dev chat if there were plans to add a new server,
the reply was that there were no new plans to add a new server. Then
not even a week after GoD is released, DING, theres a new server. I
would think that adding a new server would take SOME sort of planning
ahead and its not just a matter of getting a hair up your butt and
running down to CompUSA and picking up a server (especially since a
"server" is actually a server farm with 30+ servers from what I
understand).

Was it a strategic "lie" on their part? If so, why? What would to be
gained by a suprise launch of a server as opposed to telling us ahead
of time?
