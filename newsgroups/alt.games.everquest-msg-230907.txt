I would expect EQ to still be going 3 years from now.  I wouldn't hesitate
to get started in it.  The next wave of games, including WoW and EQ2, will
probably be very EQ like with better or different graphics and
enchancements.  I expect them to be evolutionary, not revolutionary,
products.  Play EQ now and you'll be that much more comfortable if you
choose to go to a newer product in a year or two.  With EQ Evolutions, you
can play buy most of the EQ world for $20-$30 dollars and the monthly charge
is $12-$13 (in the States).  Hopefully that's not a horrible investment to
get up and running and check the world out.  You may want to get started on
the Stromm server if you do pick up EQ.  Last I checked it still had the
best population of low level characters you can group and pal around with.
