Hmm, I have not seen these recipes anywhere. Do you have a reference to
them? I don't think I spotted them on EQTraders.

Aye, many thanks that was indeed helpful. In time I will come to understand
all of this, I just needed a little conceptual overview.

I *am* having fun again. In fact, it's scary how easily I fell back into the
routine. My first night I made spoons and got up to their 74 trivial. The
next night I revisited my old friend Banded and hit the 115 trivial for the
BPs. Last night I made my way through the entire cycle of Ornate Chain and
hit the 162 trivial on the Platinum Tunics (and I thought I was done with
the tedium of metal bits, they don't hold a candle to HQ rings)! I have to
say, I'm not very impressed with this armor, I'm assuming the
quality/effort/cost ratio is going to increase.

It 's a good thing I had a bankroll before I got this going as I can't
imagine having to depend on player sales to recoup the investment required
to get to this point and beyond. If Banded still sells on the order of 1pp
per AC, it's hard for me to imagine why anyone would pay significantly more
for a Platinum Ornate Chainmail Tunic with its modest stats, and a vendor
sale price of 112pp (130 CHA).  And I'm beginning to see your point about
the complexity of setup in the combines (although I'm sure the worst is yet
to come as I start having to farm ingredients and fashion new tempers). This
is far more complex than Blacksmithing 1.0, but also far more interesting. I
can hardly wait to get to the next level. Tonight, Fine Steel Plate (and
hey, my Alchemist Shaman will be able to dye and Imbue his own armors)!

I look forward to the many adventures ahead as I become introduced to the
higher levels of this art. Thanks for your info thus far and for any
additional insight or suggestions you might have!
