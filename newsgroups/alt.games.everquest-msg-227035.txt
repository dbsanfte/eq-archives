So, instead of one healing, snaring, DSing, nuking, harmonying druid, 
you'd rather have a wizard, a cleric, a necro, a shaman, and a bard?  I 
sure hope you are a tank class, otherwise that group is full.  The point 
is that the druid can fill a number of different roles in a group, and is 
pretty damned good at it, not the best generally, but quite good.

We routinely use druids in the CHeal chain.  I routinely group with 
druids as the main healer in any zone I xp group in.

Your friend is at a very tough level grouping wise for a druid, but, it 
does get much better for him.

Druids do quite fine in the 65 game.  Honest.  I can't answer for really 
high end raiding, but, for any xp grouping and raiding that I do druids 
are quite in demand.
