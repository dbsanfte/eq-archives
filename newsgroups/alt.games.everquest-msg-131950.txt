That's how the system DOES work though. What the OP failed to include
was that loots aren't free to the highest total. They cost points,
designed to move you down the ladder each time you loot something, based
on the value of that item. Loot something great you shoot down the
ladder, allowing the people who haven't looted a chance to move ahead of
you
