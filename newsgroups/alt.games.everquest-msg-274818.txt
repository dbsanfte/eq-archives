Nah, you can start on it then but you won't actually ding 10 until you have
the experience behind you.

Likewise you can tuck away experience credit until you are at 220% and then
do the final task to gain your citizenship.
You then jump a couple of levels to 11.  An advantage of this is that xp is
easier to come by when you are 9, so you keep earning at that level.
Once you hit 11 it takes more effort.  (I'm not saying that it is hard to
get xp by any means, just that this is a method some use).
I also gave this a go with tradeskilling - you can put away xp credit before
you select your subclass and gain a couple of levels quickly too.
