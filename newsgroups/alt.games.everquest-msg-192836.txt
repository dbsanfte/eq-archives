Just like Ghoulbane, Journeyboots, many of these items were droppable,
then changed to No Drop; some items evevn went through this change
back and forth. You can still find these items on Bazaar. I saw the
Cloak on my server quite some times.

For your 2nd question, I meant you can use this cloak in the "back"
slot. Even until level 60, the statistics of this cloak is still
pretty good. You do need some help to get this item, but buying them
is safe...

Hope this helps.
