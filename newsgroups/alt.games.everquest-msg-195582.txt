I think its less than 1% play on test, and a DIFFERENT 10% bitch about
anything that Sony does, and whine about the lousy CS they percive
getting.

Even if Sony had a GM follow each player around, they would complain
that thier GM could have PLed them more, or used the new Topless
Barbarian in a Hooters outfit. Nothing would please that 10% and I
think Sony has taken that attitude.
