Oh, a little update on killing him. I dont know if they fixed this 
error, but when i did the quest he had some MAJOR pathing issues.

Do NOT use any kinds of dot to kill him, snare, root and nuke as fast as 
you can.
For me he suddently dissapeared each time, he could stand rooted with 
10% health left, and suddenly he poofs, and by trancking him it reported 
that he saw somewhere inside a wall (yes, ran around the area twice, 
could run all the way around the wall), then suddently he could appear 
again near the fisherman (or what mob is there, at the zone to Qeynos), 
or in a wall beneath him (could hit me, but not visible).

Took me 3 tries to kill him because he kept spawning around, and 
dissapearing. Lost him 1 time due to a dot, where he died after 
dissapearing, and his corpse was in a wall somewhere.

So finish him quickly and do not use dots, and pray he dont poof on you.
