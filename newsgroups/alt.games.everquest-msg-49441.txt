If it's an item with a lot of info you wish to make known then it's a
problem.
No one really needs to know the stats on a RBB, anyone who could afford one
would already know but if it's an item under 1k it might be an idea.
2 ways of providing info. Type it all once and use Shift and Up Arrow to
repeat the post or use a hot key to program in brief info and then another
hotkey with /r and info.

Eg
HK1
/auc Black Alloy Coif  XXXpp give tell for info
HK2
/r AC8 +6str +6 to all saves, all chain wearers, all races

Then when you get a tell asking about it just hit the reply HK.

If it's several items then use the method devised by Conwict.
