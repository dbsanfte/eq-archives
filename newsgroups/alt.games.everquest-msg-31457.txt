<snip extended conversation with nitwit>

Why anyone would want to take the flashing neon sign reading 'Don't group
with me' off of these type of players is beyond me.

Hopefully you won't get too many people killed when they decide to group
with the offending player in question after he has a 'normal' name.

Weigh the alternatives ... you can quite easily ignore the name, or you can
get it forciblychanged and then lose the moron in anonymity.  I prefer the
'Stay away' sign myself, but to each their own.
