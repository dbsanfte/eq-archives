Actually there are a number of places that have the potential to be 
bottlenecks even with several instances of a zone up.  The Ghostly Orcs in 
The Sieglands as well as the Sand Giants come to mind.  These along with 
various other "Quest" mobs are camped steady even now.  Hopefully these are 
the types of wanderers they are talking about.
