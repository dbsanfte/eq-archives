Since my monk started long before the new Tutorial got added,
he's been running around with a wasted Charm slot.  I recently
saw the Tainted Heartstone, which gives bonusses based on how
many uncommon languages you know, so I picked one up for him...
only to notice too late that it's not usable by monks.  Pooh.

So I gave it to my druid instead (and had a language-spamming
session with some guildmates so she learned all the relevant
languages in 4 hours), and then sent the monk shopping again.
This time I tried a Stone of Defiance, which gives stats a bit
better than a Bristlebanes Party Platter, but only if you're
hungry.  (It actually gives the stats before you're told you're
hungry, though you have to be out of food for a while.)

My worry, of course, is that I've seen in many places that
being hungry and/or thirsty will affect my regen of hp/mana/end.
I was hoping to find a relatively flexible procedure that would
leave me with full regen while still leaving the charm active.
(E.g., I thought maybe I could start foraging once I got told
I was hungry, and I'd usually find some food before my regen
vanished.  Or something like that.)

Turns out it pretty darned easy to keep the charm active with
no ill effects other than chat-window spam about being hungry.
I've been going around with no food for several hours now, and
as near as I can tell my hp regen is the same as ever.  I have
no mana, of course, but just to check, I had my druid go around
hungry and thirsty for a while, and I saw no change in regen
for any of hp/mana/end, sitting or standing.

This isn't completely true.  Every once in a while, I notice my
monk's ENDR starts dropping, even when he's not doing anything.
It drops by 3/tick, and doesn't come back.  I don't actually use
endurance for much, so it doesn't bother me, and in any case I
usually find my ENDR is back to full after the next fight!  Last
night I tracked that down: it seems that when my ENDR is dropping
3/tick, if I use "throw stone" (level 1 discipline) to tag a mob
my ENDR bar zips back up to full.  WTF?

So mostly I'm happy because this means I get a pretty nice charm
and all I have to do is put up with chat-spam.  But I'm worried
that it's actually a bug (or, horrors, an exploit!) and I don't
want to grow too attached to it.  I assume that most people don't
go around hungry or thirsty in game, but does anyone have any
solid experience with what the effects are, or were, or are
supposed to be?
