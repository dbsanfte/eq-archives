I agree. I don't want anything to do with people that name themselves
stupidly. I was in a guild, and some folks decided to guildinvite a
guy named "thehatiesknight". I objected on the basis that this guy's
name was not a name, but was in fact a short novel. However, he got
invited anyway over my objection, so I /guildremoved myself.
