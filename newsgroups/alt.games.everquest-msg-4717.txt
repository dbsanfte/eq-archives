To my EQ friends,

     I have been a follower of this group for a very long time. I will admit
that I tend to stay relativetly quiet in regards to my posting habits. I
find that it is much better to gain the information that I need and to put
in my thoughts when they are neccessary. The one thing I can say about this
group is that the majority of the people here are good and knowledgable
people who are always willing to help everyone out. I would hate to see the
good parts of this group go down the drain thanks to useless flame wars and
senseless posting that has nothing to do with EQ at all. I have to agree
with the post named "NEWCOMERS" and say that we all need to ignore the
unintelligent fools and they will go away. Let's keep this newsgroup useful
and fun as it has always been. I hope that people don't feel that I am just
posting this for the fun of it. I truly believe this group to be better than
that. I am sure that I will recieve the usual flames and I want those people
to know that they need not expect any post from me. I have much better
things to do with my time. Thank you all for your time.

                                                         Jim G.
