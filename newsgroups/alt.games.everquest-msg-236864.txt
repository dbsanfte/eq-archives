DAoC is currently in a major state of change.  The released a
half-baked expansion called Trials of Atlantis (ToA) that really shook
up the entire world.  They're currently beating everything with a nerf
bat.  But they're also simultaneously working on a free Realm vs Realm
product that may get everything back in line.  Who knows.  Personally
I would wait and see before devoting any significant time to DAoC. 
Right now I can't say that I'm very impressed with Mythic.

I'll try to answer your other points with respect to DAoC:

Learning Curve:  Moderate.  If you're used to EQ, will be easy.

Interface:  Not bad on big monitors.  Customizable.

Casual Playability:  There's a big debate currently about the
abilities of casual gamers vs power gamers.  Especially after the
release of ToA.  The short answer is that casual gamers can certainly
play, but they may end up significantly less powerful than those that
play a lot.

Solo Playability:  You can level most classes & specs to 50.  It may
be slow, but it's possible.  Note that level is only one of many
factors in this game.

Group Playability:  Highly advisable.

Questing/Quests Quality:  Quests basically boil down to--talk to NPC,
travel long distance, kill mob, travel long distance back, repeat. 
The quests in ToA are a little better, but basically boil down to the
same thing.  After you've done a few, they're just not that fun.  You
either do them for the reward or the xp bonus.

In-game events/story:  Zero in-game events.  The story from the quests
can be interesting if you're new, but after a while you end up
fast-forwarding.  Yada yada yada, go forth young adventurer, save the
world!

Crafting Usefulness/Fun:  Mythic has been continuously struggling with
balance issues across the board.  Including equipment issues such as
crafted vs dropped vs quested vs artifacts.  Six months ago, they
achieved a pretty decent balance point.  But since ToA was released,
just about everything was hands down better.  The only point of
crafting is armorcrafting.  Basically you acquire your uber gear and
spackle in the deficiencies with a couple of crafted pieces.  With
regard to fun, you press a button to make an item and watch a green
line slowly go across your screen.  Maybe you gain skill.  Maybe you
actually make the item.  Repeat ad nauseum.  Get a book or rent a
movie while you do this mindless activity.

Economy in the game:  Varies considerably across servers.

Beauty of gameworld:  Mythic gets high marks in this area with respect
to the realms of Midgard and Albion.

Quality of Dungeons:  In the original game, dungeons are so-so.  I
think the best dungeons are in the first expansion called Shrouded
Isles.  Nice design & fun.

Lore - Depth of backstory and history, continuing story:  The *text*
is there.  I primarily play Midgard and you see a lot of Norse
references.  But you don't ever see any Norse gods or see an impact of
them in the world around you.  Mostly a facade.

Community - Good Fan sites/boards:  Not a lot of happy fans right now,
so I would pass on this.

Age of game:
  Population of servers
  Population of newbies

Do your research.  Look for a server where the population, realm
points, and relics are pretty much equal.  There are a LOT of
imbalanced servers that are just no fun.  Being on the bandwagon is no
more fun than getting the crap kicked out of you.

Server Stability:  Relatively stable.  However when you get a lot of
people in the same area, it gets extremely laggy and link deaths are
common.

Customer Service:  If you've got a simple issue, they're *usually*
pretty good.  But don't push it more than "simple".  And expect to
wait.  Although they prioritize their service, I typically wait about
2-4 hours in-game for help.  I have waited over 24 hours *in-game*.  I
had solved my own problem by then, but I just wanted to see if they
were even going to answer me.

Based on the current game, I give it an overall score of D+. 
Personally I'm biding my time until WoW.  And I'll likely never buy
another Mythic product again (unless they do something amazing in the
next couple of months).
