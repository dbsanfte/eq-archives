OK, I know I'm bragging, but I'm proud of the achievement, so sue me
):oP

Saturday afternoon the combined forces of Dark Horizon and Ytrilynth's
Horde (our sister guild) entered Sleepers Tomb. We'd been umming and
ahing about doing this for over a month now, so finally set a date a few
weeks back for an attempt. That date was 17th November 2001.

2 test runs to gauge agro levels, damage potential, kill time vs.
healing mana, etc

3 Full scale attempts - 1st down to 'Ve', 2nd past enrage to a sliver of
red, then 3rd and final kill as we refined our strategy each time.

WHen the final warder fell, the sleeper awoke and went rampaging through
the zones as the script unfolded flawlessly. Dragon battles raged across
Norrath and Kerafym wreaked his terrible revenge. Jaled Dar cackled in
glee as his underhand plan to trick us into freeing his pal worked as DN
went crazy. Yelinak put up a good fight, but eventually fell to
Kerafym's relentless pummeling. Phara Dar called all his followers to
him to hide behind. Vox and Naggy booked their long overdue honeymoon. 

Grats to Verant for designing such an entertaining show. It's a real
sense of achievement to trigger such a word changing event, and has it's
effects directly seen throughout the world.

An added bonus was the loot. We hit the jackpot: 3 shrouds and 2 hammers
(Grats monkies!), as well as one of those green stones with, 'I woke the
sleeper and all I got was this crappy rock' written on the bottom.

Now we just have to find out how to put him back in his cage. Damn that
Jaled is a wily trickster and no mistake!
