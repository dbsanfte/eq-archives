The usefullness of CA is that it lets you then buy Lightning Reflexes up 
to level 5, which further increases your damage avoidance.  It has made a 
very noticable difference for me.

As I recall, CA3 increases your damage avoidance by 10%, it does not 
allow you to avoid 10% of the damage.  So, if normally, you would avoid 
10 out of 100 hits, now you will avoid 11 out of 100, not all that 
noticable a difference.
