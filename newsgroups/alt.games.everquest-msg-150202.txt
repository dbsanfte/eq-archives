Generally speaking, off of any mobs that are within around 5 levels of the
level of the spell you are interested in researching.  As far as I know,
there are no specific mobs or zones where you will get specific words to
drop.  There are likely a few exceptions to this for some nodrop research
components.  I have seen some specific runes always drop off some specific
mobs, but have never looked into whether or not they are research
components.  Basically, it's a royal pain in the butt to get the components.
You have to check merchants where people are likely to have sold the
components of the level you are looking for.  The vendors in Oasis are good
for components for level 16, and maybe 20, spells for example.  My enchanter
is still trying to get the rest of her level 20 spells.
