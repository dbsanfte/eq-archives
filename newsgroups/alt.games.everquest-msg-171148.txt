Word was on my server, as I spent three levels in FV, that he has a
Drolvarg PH. The ubers cut down as many as they can. He wanders
parallel to the zonewall by Drolvarg camps back and forth between FV
giant camp and sea cliffs unless agro'd and trained.

The only other undead in that zone is Vekis pet and if he shows on
detect undead;  then J isn't up as Vekis's pet is on opposite side of
zone just outside FV outpost.
