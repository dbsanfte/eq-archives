Sebilis was *the* high level zone to hunt in well before the recent
changes making EJ a 'port from anywhere' point. It used to be; either
get a port to Dreadlands and run through DL,FV,SoNH,TT to get there (all
but 1 are zones where you can easily die without SoW/invis), or run from
the DL port, zone into Karnors, get ANOTHER port to EJ, run through EJ
and TT. It also has an annoying one way zone which means once you're in,
you ain't getting out without a port or a LOT of luck during non-
primetime.
