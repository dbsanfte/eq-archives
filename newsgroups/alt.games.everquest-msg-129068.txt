Oh I agree with you there..

There is very little to be proud of..

I simply hold it up as a mirror to those who bleed for the
Palestinians and castigate the Israelis.  

It's an example to show that such things happen.. It is evolution.
Survival of the fittest.

When all those who lamblast the Israelis for their actions are ready
to give back all they own to the American Indian, then and ONLY then
will I believe they are speaking from anything other the bigotry,
prejudice and anti-semitism...
