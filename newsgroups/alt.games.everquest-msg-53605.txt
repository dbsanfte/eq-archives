I have to ask the same thing!!??
I have a 51 Ranger and 52 Mage and my mage is by FAR the best soloer!!
My Ranger can't solo for crap!!
For a example I was  playing around in Najena last night and mage was
wiping up zone  with earth pet, my ranger would have been down to his
last bubble of health and no mana.
Too much down time for him.
My  mage doesn't have any problems finding a place to solo anywhere.
Granted there are some mobs he can't solo and needs a group for.
Also there some mobs he has tried to get to for a camp, but too many
yard trash in the way for him to make and again needs a group to do
it.

But for  just pure Xp hunting where I can pick and choose which mobs I
want, it ain't a problem to solo.

Currently he is hunting in CS and having no problems. I see a lot of
druids there quad-kiting and not always doing so good.
I get really sick of them druids kiting their mobs over the top of me
all the time there, even when I am sitting by the ramp up to zone out
stone.
