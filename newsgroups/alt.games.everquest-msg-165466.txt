Nope don't qualify to be uber since I did finish school. And yes
that's all I want FT3 for my bard so I can swarm kite till my fingers
fall off. :)

Absolutely the most fun in this game. Nothing like kiting 16 mobs
(that's so far is my high but whos counting) knowing that one minor
screw up is a CR. First char I've ever had that could clear the entire
spiroc population solo if I get the place to myself. One Druid that
bragged on his 9 pull (on KEI of course) became suddenly silent and
went else where. Think Raptors are next unless someone has a better
idea.

Peace
