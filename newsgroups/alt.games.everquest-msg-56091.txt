 I mapped every single dungeon in the original Bards Tale. It was
somewhere along that time when I finished the game that I said I would
never map another game again. Mapping out dungeons? Not for this
experienced player. Not anymore. /shiver

 Besides, eq zones/dungeons aren't nearly as symetrical as those you are
referring to.
