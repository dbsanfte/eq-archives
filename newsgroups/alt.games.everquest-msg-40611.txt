Dont know the price range on Tunare, only play on Veeshan, but max i have seen them for are
1300pp, and lowest 200pp. If i had one i would take around 500pp, but i dont think i would get
one as a high level char.
Its more for the low levels, you can probably find better 2hb for the high level ones. (like
Lamentation Rod, 90DD and stun, my level 30 troll use one, cant wait till it start proccing)
