It does lack it and I found that to be very annoying because I used it
a lot in EQ1. When you can't find a group but you have found one other
player you have a choice - group and effectively remove yourself from
the list of people LFG or don't group in the hopes that you can find a
larger group.  If you do the first you have the option of shouting in
OOC every now again to find more but that's not ideal.

Maybe they thought that nobody ever used it.  It was certainly less
used than LFG when I played EQ1.
