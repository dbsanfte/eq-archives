Corrupt guards are on bloodsabers faction.  After a killing umpteen million
gnolls, and handing in more bonechips than Richard Leakey has ever seen,
Qeynos Guards were warm to me, Bloodsabors scowled.  That, and having killed
Robbie Schlister a few times for the Investigator's badge (turn-in failed
first time) also gave me a pretty good faction differential.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
