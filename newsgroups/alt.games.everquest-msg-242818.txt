But you are completely wrong, you never have to buy anything at a camp 
with points earned at that camp to unlock anything.

For example:

I earn 200 points in Mistmoore, and 200 points in Miragul.  I buy 400 
points worth of items in Miragul, never spending any points in Mistmoore.  
Now, I earn another 200 points in Rujarkian, I spend those 200 points in 
Mistmoore.

To unlock items, you need to earn points in a camp, not spend them.
