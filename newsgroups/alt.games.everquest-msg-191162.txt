I went through JPF with my ranger from about 41-51, saw lots of druids in 
there killing griffons and griffawns.  Poachers and gnolls are supposedly 
good XP as well, though I didn't mess with them much.  The zone is a 
lagfest if you don't have a good video card (wasn't too bad if I turned 
down my clip plane with my GeForce 2 GTS).

Happy Hunting.
