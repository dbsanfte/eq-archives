The worst thing you can do is use the vendor as a refence for pricing. Only
Verrant knows what sets the price of vendor items!

For example:

Diamond Encrusted Staff for 30p from a vendor ...(worth about 3k to another
player)
Fine Steel Staff for 65p from a vendor  ...(worthless to a player)

Fine Steel wepons will hit creatures that can only be hit by magic weapons.
Most weapons that drop in the game, except the newb and lowb zone weps, will
hit magical creatures.
