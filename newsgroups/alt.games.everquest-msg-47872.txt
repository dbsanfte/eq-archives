I'm just curious, on a blue server, when a monk/necro/SK successfully
uses FD when a mob attacks, the mob will walk away.  But what happens
when they try using FD on a PvP server when they're being attacked by
another player?  Obviously the other player isn't going to buy it and
will keep attacking, but I'm wondering if the other player would get a
message saying something like "You can't attack this player, he's
already dead", or would it just be that monks/necros/SKs can't use FD
when other players attack them?

Thanks in advance,
