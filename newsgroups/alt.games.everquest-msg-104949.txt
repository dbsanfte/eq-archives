Even if your assertion about level bonuses is true, it does not make
the test "flawed".  What I set out to test was whether your displayed
"AC" is a meaningful "stat".  My results show rather clearly that it
is not.

Also, I have never seen any assertion before this of a hidden level-
based bonus to melee defense, please tell me where you came across
any evidence of this.  I have seen posts by Verant speaking about
hidden level-based modifications to attacks (the "damage tables"),
and of course the well known level-based melee damage bonus that is
now displayed when you examine a weapon, as well as the well known
effect relative level has on resists, but exactly nothing about
hidden melee defense.  If you choose to design and conduct a
repeatable test to support your assertion I will be more than happy
to examine your data and perhaps perform the same test to see if your
results can be duplicated.
