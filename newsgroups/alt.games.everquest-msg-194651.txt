I seem to remember there being a little feature like that that explained 
why some people were getting silly amouts of AAxp.

For level 59 the mofifier would be about 20% (i.e. 20% more xp than you 
should get) for 58 it would be about -10%. So probably notacable, but 
not hugely.

(Did they smooth 60 ? or does it still take much less time than 59 ? If 
they did smooth then you would expect a -50% modifier which would be 
very noticable)

Any one close to the end of 59 want to test it ?

I suspect that if this was happening then someone would have noticed, so 
I expect that the smoothing modifier is only applied to xp and not aaxp.

Hth,
