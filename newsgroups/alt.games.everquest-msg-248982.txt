I think there's some ambiguity in the way the game describes all these
things, so just to clarify:  all players get exactly the same benefit from
an active Leadership power, regardless of their archetype. However, certain
archetypes provide a better bonus to the group than other archetypes.
Defenders, who are regarded as the best buffers in the game, provide the
biggest boost (12.5%), followed by Controllers (10%) and then others (7.5%).
But all players in the group receive the same benefit while the power is
activated.
