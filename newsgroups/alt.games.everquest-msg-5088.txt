No problem, Verant DOES replace forgotten passwords. You have the CD with
the CD-key. Al you need to do is call them in the USA, and ask for a
replacement password. I think you have to give your creditcard number again
too, since that is unique, and is hard to guess by someone that stole your
cd :)

Key generators do not exist. You can only "generate" a key with your
creditcard number :)
