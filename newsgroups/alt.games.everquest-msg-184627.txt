I also use a Dell Inspiron 8000, with a 900Mhz Pentium 3, 32mb Geforce 2,
and 512MB of RAM. I have the graphics set to medium settings, and have about
half of the models turned on. It runs pretty well. I recently upgraded from
256 RAM to 512, and that made a big difference. It used to stop every 5
minutes or so and chunk on the hard drive for 10 seconds, while the screen
was frozen on the enraged mob rushing at me with its claws bared. That was
always nice.

 But now it is all good.
