Oh, please. I said nothing to make the whiney baby feel unwelcome (up
until now). If he felt unwelcome over what I said, it's his own damn
fault for being overly sensitive, not mine.

Who the fuck are you, anyway? SOme newcomer who has decided he's an
expert on all the personalities here and has decided to flame those of
us he doesn't like straight off, far's I can tell. I have no qualms
about making someone like that feel unwelcome...
