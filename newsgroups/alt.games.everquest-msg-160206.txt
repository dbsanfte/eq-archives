I don't see how that keeps you honest, but ok.

I had better luck using the "r" key personally, since /r will talk to the
last person that sent you a tell... here's an example.

Guildleader tells you something
*you start typing response with /r*
Someone else tells you something
*end response, hit enter*
Someone else gets the tell intended for guildleader.
