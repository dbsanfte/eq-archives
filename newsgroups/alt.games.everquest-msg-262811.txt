No.  Not because of the no drop rules but because I don't want to
restart my character.  I'm level 28 and I want to develop my character
more.  I have played the lower game too many time trying to find the
class for me.  Also, I don't have a lot of time to play so it would
be months before I got to 28 again.

Probably.  I'm an Enchanter and so I don't rely on my stuff as much as
other classes do.  It would be hard but I think that it would be ok.

I just destroyed a lot of my no drop gear as I had upgraded it with
gifts from some people I grouped with.  This would have upgraded the
"probably" to a "yes" last week before I did this.  Maybe if they
replaced my stuff with newbie quest stuff so that I wouldn't be
completely naked.


> Discuss

The recent thread that you started on why the stuff you loot is only
ever going to be good enough to sell has led me to believe that the
bazaar has reduced my enjoyment of the game.  I can't stop using it now
otherwise I wouldn't get any upgrades for about 10 - 20 levels.  That
would be removing the enjoyment of upgrades completely for another
6 months or more.  (like I said - I don't have much time to play)

Overall I like the idea but I WOULD need to be able to transfer my
character.
