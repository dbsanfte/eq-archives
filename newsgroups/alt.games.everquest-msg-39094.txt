I don't know. I hear about people holding stuff for other people all the 
time. The reason I can think of for this is twinking another character. 

Now, granted, I've twinked some of my characters a little, but if I came up 
on a stranger and asked, "Could you hold this for me?" and they said yes 
and I came back with my other character and they said "Sorry, tough luck," 
I would figure it's my own fault.

(How's that for a run-on sentence. :)

I don't think I'd have the guts to actually petitition it and admit to a 
Guide/GM that I was an idiot.
