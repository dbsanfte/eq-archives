My first character to get to 20 had a last name.  I spent several levels
before 20 contemplating last names, before settling on one ("Darksmith", for
a Dark Elf...I like it because it indicates that I see bringing evil as my
profession, and since my RL last name is Smith it is a play on words).

Subsequently, both in EQ and in DAoC, it has not been a big deal.  If I
happen to think of a *great* name for one of my characters, I'll probably
take it, but otherwise I'll stay with just a first name.

I've seen the same thing with other people: first time, it is a big deal,
but on subsequent characters they either go for nothing, or something
stupid or silly or funny.  (Funny names can be fun...I saw a Troll Warrior
run by once named something like "Pretty Flowers").
