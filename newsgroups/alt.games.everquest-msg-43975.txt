Fear kite Mammoths in everfrost.  Good experience and good cash from the
tusks.  Snare, fear, dot, melee.  Still decent exp at 30, got two blue
bubs in about 2 hours or so.  At 30, they are all blue to my druid, the
tainted mammoth is blue, the corrupt mammoth is even con, and it drops
the chunk of tundra needed for the druid epic.
