    In the past it was. Dwarves have barbarian-level main tank stats, lack
Slam but do have Infravision. They were competitive with barbarians (which
put them just a rung below trolls and ogres) as twink warriors, and were an
excellent choice if you wanted ease of play (small size, excellent faction,
no sight problems, great 1-20 areas to level with quest support). In the
endgame, all they lacked was Slam. But now they lack Slam and the ability to
get some of the best smithed armour ever created.

    I was talking about the old dwarf cultural here, but the new Underfoot
Plate can be worn by up to four races (DWF GNM HFL HEF) depending on imbue.
Not bad. But (and this is a massive but), Fierce Heraldic plate (the Rallos
Zek imbue) can be worn by HUM, BAR, ELF, DEF, HEF, TRL, OGR, HFL, GNM
followers of Rallos Zek. It gives Kael-level AC, and has better +HPs than
Kael armour. A lot of our warriors wear this stuff, because it's that damn
good, and that includes some of our main tanks. We are the top guild on our
server, and our warriors still wear this stuff! Nobody creating a warrior
twink today should overlook that this stuff exists.

    Yes, they can. Look under "Fierce Heraldic" on EQTraders:

    And look at those HPs. This stuff replaces NToV drops, sadly enough.

    Non-imbued stuff, with the exception of a few pieces (like bracers), is
so-so compared with something like Kael quest armour. Fierce Heraldic allows
a warrior to bypass doing Velious quest armour entirely.
