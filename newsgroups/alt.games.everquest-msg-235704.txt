Not as well as the standard lulling class's...I was responding to:

"Are Monks back to being the
premier pullers?"

Outdoor ranger / druid HoN (seem to be less resists with HoN, that I have
noticed). And bard lull*.

Indoor Cleric / Enchanter Pacify (resists in hard ldon are insane though).
And bard lull.*

"Useful if you only need to lull a single mob,"

I stand by this :)

Monks are still the best in some zones, but in my own opinion I think SK are
a better choice for FD pulling (just because of the snare / FD trick).


Overall, would say the best (read: safest / fastest) pullers are:

Outdoors:

Bard (lull + fm)
Ranger / Druid (HoN + IC)
SK (FD + Snare)
Monk (FD + ghetto lull#)
Cleric / Enchanter (pacify)

Indoors:

Bard (lull + fm)
SK (FD + Snare)
Monk (FD + ghetto lull#)
Cleric / Enchanter (pacify)

This can of course change, depending on situation, hence the 'overall' part
:)

Probably missed something, is early and am half asleep, all corrections
accepted ;p

*Bard lull is LoS as far as I am aware, making it tricky to use in some
dungeons.
#Ghetto lull as it can only be used to pacify / lull one target maximum.
