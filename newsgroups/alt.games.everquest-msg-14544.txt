Three things come to mind from reading both the message from the link and
your statements.

1)  I agree that the punishment was to extreme -- someone took the 'exploit'
personal (look what they did to my masterpiece!).  We're all human and we
tend to take pride in our workmanship.  Watching someone trash what you
spent days, weeks, months, etc... working on can be hard to swallow at
imes  -- slack from and for such 'offenses' is necessary and cool heads
help.

2)  If they have problems with 'big critters' like this then shut them down
until they are fixed -or- shut them down and have them run by the GM's
manually.  Vox, Nag, whatever...  If they are so worried about exploits then
show it by making them manual or shutting them down until they are fixed
fully.

3)  Brad sounds like someone being a good boss.  His folks made a decision
and, right or wrong, he has to back them or he becomes the arbiter for ALL
issues.  Picture 1 person trying to deal with as many whiners, dweebs as
well as the real issue folks how call and you get the idea that, at times,
its better to tick off a lot of folks that to tick off the few (staff).

As for a recommendation to such a situation -- get all parties on-line in a
live chat situation with a participating audience.  Discuss the issue before
users and with staff on-line who made and/or contributed to the decision.

If the staff wishes to recind the decision then it is recinded.  If they
choose to back it up then, in this type of situation, let them defend this
choice to the user community.

Brad simply mediates the flow and bounces the dorks who do the 'spam, spam,
spam -- swear, etc...'.  He does NOT decide the outcome -- rubber stamps
whatever the final is and that decision belongs with his staff -- any way
you look at it, they are the ones who will live with the decision.
