first thing to do is to get that bard bound in Freeport!! Just keep going at
it and stay near the inn in EC, lions don't go that way too often so it
should be safe, I always stay away from spiderlings at low levels because of
poison and mass aggro.  Stick to fire beetles and black bears, soon
skeletons and orcs.  I send my bard over to GFay and hunted CB Orcs till 8
then did bone chips in Kaladim for 9 then back to EC and now I'm 11.
  Buy all your spells and songs, you never know!!
