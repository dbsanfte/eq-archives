As ugly as it sounds, he is right.

I have been involved in the development and beta testing of many games
from the player side of things (mostly flight sims). The more the
developers listened to the players the more the games suffered. Most
players only lobby for changes that will benefit themselves. Few, if
any, offer suggestings that will make the game better overall. It is
just a fact of human nature. 

The games that suffered the most were run by developers that had no
clear vision of where they wanted to take the game, and it showed.
They flounder from one player suggestion to another and in the end
nothing worked right, and most people hated the game.

It's a no-win situation.  

Verant has a solid "vision" of where they want to take EQ. You can
love it or hate it, but so far it has been an amazing cash cow for the
company. They obviously "know" thier market, better than we know
ourselves :)

Cheers
