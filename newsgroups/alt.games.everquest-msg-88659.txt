i had the same problem, maybe you can see my post back on jan 16, i put in 2
pics from the FV boat (not sure how long your news server keeps msgs.)
but for a whoppin 2 whole  days the boat problem on my box was fixed, until
verant came out with a new eqgfx_dx8.dll (which i think is the root of the
prob,but i could be wrong)
verant claims that the file will increase framerate, bah


i too have an ati radeon 64mb ddr vivo and downloaded the beta 6025 drivers
and jacked up anti-aliasing to the max
