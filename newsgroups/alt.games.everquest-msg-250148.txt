Are you honestly trying to make the case that Norrath, its moon, and
its planes aren't in this universe? I could swear that all of them
exist on computers in San Diego in magnetic form on hard drives
connected to servers that send that information out all over the
world. When i said the game world had physicality.. like an island.. i
meant it. And yes.. it exists in this universe, just in a different
form than what you are accustomed to.

And when I type in my credit card #.. and this magical universe
backchecks my account through VISA.. is that a violation?

Since 200kpp doesn't automagically show up on an account.. it really
did have to come from somewhere :>. After all.. its not like a main
doesn't trade 200kpp via the common slot to their twink level 4 broke
ass warrior to gear him up. Is that a deus ex machina? And thats
perfectly acceptable to do in the current game.

Neither does the player chain.. you start from a generated level 1
character out of... nothin. When you accept the reward on a new
expansion the Al'Sapor(sp?) bag or whatever it was.. where does it
come from? Nothin. Simply allowing a player to do a 1-1 transfer of
money to some new currency in game is no more of a stretch than any
other thing they've done. Think of it like a casino where you trade
money for chips to be used in the games and then back again. You are
simply moving the dollar from one economy to another.

Well... if you didn't think that... trying to debate me on something

Assuming of course i conceded the point that Everquest is equivalent
to buying a book, which i certainly do not. A book is a story set in a
singular 'universe' with a beginning, middle, end that cannot change.
Everquest is a 'universe' in which multiple stories can be created..
and in fact most of the point is to create your own story. I use the
'universe' term so you don't get confused and think of it as actually
in something other than our own.

:> Right.. because you would transfer your dollariums to dollars at Bankium
and then send them to New York via Western Union :P.

Nono.. AoW's heart attack.. sorry if i wasn't clear. God interfering
to solve a problem, you wiping to AoW. And yeah.. it would be stupid..
that's why storytellers try to avoid deus ex machina's.
