Now we're talkin'.

Shoot. A person doesn't have to be Jewish to see the Israeli side of this
thing, either.  All people need in order to be good people is to have a huge
place in their hearts for justice, even when its demands are hard.

Tonight I finally had a chance to watch a DVD of  *Boys Don't Cry*.  I am
not a lesbian . . . ahem, obviously,  as in fact, I'm not all that big on
Gay Rights, since it's my view that there's nothing "gay" about such a sad
way of life that deprives a person from enjoyment of the opposite sex.  I
reject the heredity argument not only because there is utterly no genetic
evidence to support it, but because Freud's explanations are so convincing,
so rational, and so easily born out by the case histories, time after time,
and since there are a number of cases on record of these sad, anything but
"gay" folks being turned around by psychoanalysis to happy heterosexual
lives . . . well, like I say, it's my view that for society to promote and
glamorize, make all kind of special allowances for a mere, sad little
personality disorder like that is a big cultural mistake.

Even so, with that said, my heart really bled for Teena Brandon--as it does,
in any case for such sad victims of any kind of abuse--and everything in my
being just wanted to get hands on those two ignorant sadists and that absurd
trailer trash mother from hell that were bashing that girl; every fiber in
my being just so wanted to tear them limb for limb, smash their faces for
every smash they laid on that poor sad girl.  That's justice. One of those
boys is in the Death House for what he did, and that's right where he
belongs headed for that long last gurney ride to hell.

So, in like fashion, there is nothing in the world to stop any person who is
neither an Israeli nor Jewish, from feeling just as Jewish as any Jew when
it comes to finding in his heart the same heart as that of an Israeli Sabra
in an overpowering sense of need for just vengeance against all those big
bullies out there who are always, and forever taking out their weird
frustrations on that valiant little nation and its people.  They've seen
enough of it in this world and may God lay a curse on the head of any person
who would bring more of it upon them.

Unfortunately, for too long the teaching of history, and the telling of news
on the subject of Israel has veered from a clear and objective view, the one
I was treated to growing up in the 50's, sitting in grade school before my
copy of *The Weekly Reader* with photos of those brave Israeli kids growing
up in kibbutzim, this in a nation of Israel not yet even ten years old;
these sons and daughters, brothers and sisters of the death camp survivors
making a proud place for themselves in the world, fighting against huge odds
to finally, after so many centuries of forced exile to return to their place
in the world, finally a place in the world where a Jew might be able to say,
"Nobody can charge that I am an alien in the land; not here, not any more!"

No.  Every people on earth has a land to lay claim to, a place to live in
the tradition of its people.  This must be, or else the pogroms, or else
Nazi Germany. It is either the one or the other and if it's the other then
they start shipping the children off to gas chambers and ovens. That is the
insane result when there is a people who are alien in a strange land.

And in the land of Israel and Judea, the Jews had always lived side by side
with their Arab cousins come of the same blood of Abraham.  They had always
managed pretty well, even after the conquest of Canaan, after the return
from bondage in Egypt, after the war with the Philistines, after the Exile
in Babylon, all through the period of the Maccabees, in times previous to
the coming of Mohammad, and even afterward, depending upon who was
interpreting the potentially deadly verses of the Koran, and after that,
even so, there remained in Turkish Syria, the former Roman Palestine, a
remnant of Jews who had lived there among the Arabs in relative peace ever
since the time of David, down through the centuries right up to the time of
the UN partition. So don't anyone dare say that is not the homeland of the
Jews.

There is a rationality that the heart teaches which has a surety of
conviction that goes far beyond anything the head can teach or talk about.
By hindsight of what had so recently happened in the Third Reich, not even
ten years hence from that, we just knew how well the Jews deserved to have
their homeland, and how justice simply could not be done by the Jews without
it.  Something of gain to the Jews had to come forth from the flames of
those belching smokestacks, some kind of lightening would need to strike the
world in the aftermath of that horrible storm, and that would form into a
rainbow over the Promised Land, by God in heaven and that would be more
important than the opposition that was soon to come from the Arabs living in
that land.  The Jews meant no harm by them or to them.  This was known to
the enlightened ones among them, as for example Emir Feisal, the man who had
ridden beside Lawrence, a true man who was one hundred percent in favor of
reestablishing the ancient homeland of the Jews in a newly partitioned
Palestine.

All the land held by Jews up to the time of partition had been purchased
fair and square from Arab landowners and there was no depredation of any
sort upon the Arabs until the fedayeen got started with their raids, their
cattle and crop stealing, and when the throat cutting of children got going,
so did the Irgun of Menachim Begin, and they returned slit throat for slit
throat, they returned the murder of children for the murder of children,
right down to the toll of whole villages massacred in retribution for the
same--and the rest of Israeli Jewry was scandalized by the actions of the
Irgun.

And what will I say about that?  I say that since I was not living there in
fear for the lives of my wife and children that I have no say, that it is
none of my damned business to judge seeing as how it is not, and I repeat
*not* a rational matter, but an existential one.  You have to be there
feeling the fear and the rage to know what must be done to hold up your end
of the fight.  I know one thing:  until the bombing of the King David Hotel,
the British were determined to stick it out, but after that happened they
got started throwing in their cards and so far as Begin and the boys were
concerned, it works like this:  when a fedayeen comes creeping into the
bedroom of your children to cut their throats, he has cut the throats of his
own children, and when the British were doing all they could to stop Jewish
immigration to appease that fanatic Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, they had lit
the fuse to the dynamite that blew up the King David Hotel and their own
asses into the bargain.

I know this:  When the bombing of Berlin and Dresden got started many, many,
many a German child was burned to death in its bed, right along with all
those children that were marched into the "shower" at Auschwitz, and so who
is anyone to judge what the hard demands of justice are in this world?
