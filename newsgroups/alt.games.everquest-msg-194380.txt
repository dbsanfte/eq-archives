I actually live in the land of eskimoes (PC name for the northern peoples is
Inuit) and very small trees (we're below the treeline here.. barely), where
hoar is actually a type of frost (and very pretty at -40, on a cloudless day
during our 5 hours of daylight) and I laughed pretty hard at the above
comment.

Don't ya just hate it when Dad takes the skidoo to work and you're stuck
with the dog sled...  Or when you forget to get your best pair of mukluks
from the dry-cleaners before they close.. Or gross generalizations...

FYI, In Canada, we're taught to spell it colour, armour and so forth :D
