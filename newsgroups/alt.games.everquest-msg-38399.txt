Hey Whittleberry, Pelrond here.

I can't give you much advice since my highest is 17, my half-elf karana
druid, but I play a lot of characters now.  My druid is still my main but I
only play him for a few hours per week.  I have 7 characters on our server
and 1 on another server.  Make a new character but don't do any twinking
until it's level 10 or something.  No powerlevelling at all.  Make it be
glad for every snake skin it gets.  And jump for joy when you get a cracked
staff!  1pp!  Ah, the joys of youth. ;-)

I started a dwarf warrior recently.  No spells to buy and with kicking butt
you can afford a new piece of banded every 3 or 4 days.  Lot's of quests
too.  It's also fun to walk around beating the crap out of stuff.

Good luck,

Lewis
