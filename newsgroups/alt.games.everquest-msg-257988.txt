I am looking for a good flat panel monitor so I can play two
characters at once, but I don't want to waste my money on a piece of
junk that doesn't look good.  I want at least a 17"+ monitor and don't
mind spending a little extra for quality.

I was wondering if anyone playing EQ had such a monitor they use and
could recommend?
