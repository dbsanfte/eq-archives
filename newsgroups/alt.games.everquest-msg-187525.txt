Unknown illness prompts rare global warning
By Rob Stein
Washington Post

The World Health Organization issued a rare emergency global alert Saturday,
warning that a mysterious, sometimes fatal pneumonia-like illness posed a
worldwide threat after spreading from Asia to Europe and North America.

More than 400 people have been sickened by the disease since the respiratory
illness surfaced in China, including at least 150 new cases in the past week
alone, officials said. At least nine people have died, and dozens more are
seriously ill.

The latest death was a Vietnamese nurse who died Saturday at the Hanoi
French Hospital after having earlier treated an American businessman who
also died of the disease, said Lucien Blanchard, hospital director.

Concern spiked Saturday after the first cases were reported outside Asia. At
least eight people have been stricken in two clusters on each coast of
Canada -- British Columbia and Toronto -- and two have died. In addition,
the first case was reported in Europe: A doctor from Singapore was
hospitalized in Frankfurt after getting off a plane from New York seriously
ill.The unidentified doctor was being treated, and his wife and traveling
companion were being kept in isolation.

No cases have been reported in the United States, but federal and state
health officials are tracing the movements of the Singapore doctor, who had
been attending a medical conference in New York, and one of the Canadian
victims, who had recently returned from Atlanta. Officials are concerned
that the two may have spread the disease before leaving. The illness appears
to have an incubation period of two to seven days.

The advisory did not call for a halt in travel, but it warned travelers and
travel employees to be alert for the symptoms of the disease and to seek
treatment immediately if such symptoms become apparent.

`Worldwide health threat'

The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which dispatched
experts to Hanoi earlier in the week and is analyzing blood samples to try
to identify the cause, Saturday activated its emergency-operations center in
Atlanta. The CDC issued a nationwide alert to hospitals and doctors to be on
the lookout for cases.

Cases have been reported in Canada, Germany, China, Vietnam, Thailand, the
Philippines, Singapore and Indonesia, prompting the WHO to urge nations to
take steps to stem further spread.

``This syndrome . . . is now a worldwide health threat,'' Gro Harlem
Brundtland, the WHO's director general, said in the alert. ``The world needs
to work together to find its cause, cure the sick and stop its spread.''

The disease typically begins with flulike symptoms -- a high fever,
coughing, headache, malaise, shortness of breath or other difficulty
breathing. It often progresses to pneumonia, with some patients
deteriorating to where they require a respirator. So far, the disease has
not responded to antibiotics.

``This is a situation that is evolving very quickly,'' said U.S. Health and
Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson, in a hastily arranged conference
call with reporters. ``Health officials around the world are taking this
situation very seriously.''

Bay Area agents who book travel and vacation packages to Asia were just
hearing of the WHO warning Saturday, but feared it was even more bad news
for an industry already rocked by a sagging economy and war jitters.

At the Travel Desk in San Jose, consultant Mary Bronson said she had
recently booked trips to Singapore and China, but that no one had called to
cancel -- yet.

``I just read about it,'' Bronson said. ``Maybe it will take until Monday''
for people to call.

`One more thing'

The sluggish U.S. economy, worse in California than the rest of the nation,
and particularly bad in the Bay Area, has taken a sizable bite out of
business and vacation travel. And in recent months, fear about a possible
war with Iraq has scared off even more potential travelers, agents said.

``This is a very scary thing,'' Bronson said of the health warning. ``With
everything else going on, this is one more thing for people to worry
about.''

An agent who specializes in trips to the Philippines, and who declined to
give her name, agreed that it was too early to measure the effect of the
health warning, but that other factors already were hurting travel.

``I haven't heard anything,'' said the agent. ``People are canceling their
trips not because of an illness, but because of the war.''

There is no evidence that the illness is the result of terrorism, but
nothing can be ruled out until scientists identify the cause, which has
eluded testing in China, the United States, France and Japan, officials
said.

Officials said they expected that many more cases may have gone undetected
in the Asian countries where the outbreaks began, and still more would
likely be detected there and elsewhere around the world.

``It's spreading fast,'' said WHO official Dick Thompson. ``There are
already cases from Hanoi to Toronto, and we're just two weeks out.''

Where it started

The outbreaks appear to have begun in mid-February in Guangdong province in
China, where at least 305 people developed a pneumonia-like illness. Five
people died before the outbreak subsided.

The first international alert was triggered when the American businessman,
who had been living in China, arrived in Hanoi from Shanghai severely ill
with an unknown respiratory illness. The 48-year-old man, who has not been
identified, was hospitalized. After more than two dozen hospital workers
became ill, the patient was transferred to another hospital in China. He
died there Thursday.

At least 11 more people were admitted to Bach Mai Hospital in Hanoi after
coming down with the same flulike symptoms.

Similar outbreaks were subsequently reported at several hospitals in Hong
Kong.

So far, every test for a known pathogen has come back negative, raising
concern that the disease may be caused by a previously unknown virus or
other infectious microbe.

``It's always worrisome when you can't put a diagnosis on a disease. You
can't predict anything,'' said David Heymann, head of communicable diseases
for the WHO, which has named the disease severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS).
