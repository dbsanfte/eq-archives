I do the exact same thing.

Minimal, perhaps.   But better than nothing, considering its free.  For a
warrior, you use the DPS ones in situations where you are in control, where
you know the temporary dip in your endurance bar is unlikely to spell
disaster.

Defensive disciplines are for when the shit hits the fan.    What you need
to do in a problem is A) keep the mob hitting you and B) keep from dying
while doing A.  Furious (12 sec invulnerability) saves you from adds or late
CH'es.  Defensive (3 minutes) lessens the damage when mobs are just plain
hitting too hard for the available healing.   A dead tank doing double
damage is pretty useless. : p

In a real emergency, it's furious, then defensive...  and if the mob is
still alive at the end of your 3:12... *shrug*  Not having an offensive disc
available to use after that doesn't mean much to me, cause most likely I'm
out of either hit points or stamina at that point.

With the stuff we're fighting now, as a warrior, saving me *is* saving the
group.     Nine times out of ten, I'm the only one there with enough hit
points armor class and defensive AA's to tank mobs that are swinging 2-3
times for 1100 per hit.   If I die the group wipes.  (or evacs if lucky.)

And I can honestly say this is a situation I'm extremely unlikely to ever
run into again.   For the first part, mobs have too many hit points for it
to work like that.  A full run of my offensive disc means over 30 seconds,
I'd do 30 percent of the mobs hit points instead of 15 percent.    Whee?
For the second part... against things that hit this hard, a beastlord pet
won't last long enough for me to run my disc and solo kill something.
Neither would the beastlord, for that matter.

No, pretty much it's up to the casters to either root, mez or otherwise
control the adds.   All I can really do is concentrate on surviving the
targets we're currently killing.


An example of where a defensive discipline will save you when an offensive
wouldn't?   Ok... for whatever reason, an overpull comes in.  3 mobs, all of
which hit for 1000 per swing, double / triple.   AE Taunt + Furious.   Bard
/ Enchanter now has 12 seconds to get 2 of them under control, whereas the
combined damage of all three would have dropped me like third period French.
With the cleric and slower right behind.
