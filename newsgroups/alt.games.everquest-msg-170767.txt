I'd argue that there a lot of people who have never been two-boxed
powerleveled who shouldn't inflict themselves on groups.  I know at least
one player who grouped all the way up to 50, but only did one thing in
groups.  Ask this person to do anything else and he's lost (and soloing is
completely out of the question).  I know another guy who's a hybrid class
and never knows what all the spells for his level are (just can't get him to
read castersrealm).  If this guy PLs a character who doesn't know what to do
in a group (and I don't take that as a given), how do you distinguish him
from all the other crappy groupers out there?
