Whoever tell Zakmuk dat troll in da hand is still dere make bad
joke on Zakmuk.  Now dere be a froggie dere name of Sugan da
Fist.  When Zakmuk look at dis froggie it look like da froggie be
indifferent to Zakmuk.  But he not sell nuttin.  When Zakmuk say
"Hail Sugan," Sugan hit Zakmuk so hard he fly all da way to the
wall around da swamp.  If dat wall not be dere, Zakmuk might
still be flyin'.  Good ting dat froggie not chase Zakmuk, cause
Zakmuk lost half his HP on dat one hit.  Zakmuk never fly like
dat before -- it be a long way from dat hand in da swamp to da
wall and Zakmuk fly all da way.

Now Zakmuk need find a barbarian or sumwon to go to da moon for
him.  Zakmuk cannot go to da moon 'cause his machine is old and
too slow to go to da moon.
