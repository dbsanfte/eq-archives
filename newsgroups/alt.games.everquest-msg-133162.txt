Im sure "ordinary" VT mobs are much much much easier than the SSRA named, in
particular the emporer.  And the loot blows SSra away.

The risk is getting to VT.. once your in, its time to reap the reward for
your hard effort.

How many people would it take to kill Kland, Yeli etc?  Say 30-50 people for
first broods.. the reward is a ST key,

But the hard work is already done (killing the dragon).. ST named mobs are
doable with 1 group.  I Don't see VT being any different
