True.  I've read message boards where clerics would complain about
sometimes having a hard time getting groups in their teens/20s because
druid/shaman heals were still fairly close to cleric heals (they would
get five levels after the cleric) and some groups would chose a druid
or shaman over the cleric because druids/shaman can SoW while clerics
can't.  But once the cleric reaches 34, he/she runs away from the
druid/shaman pack then.
