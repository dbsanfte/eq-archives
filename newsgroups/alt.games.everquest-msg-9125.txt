You should try the exact quote before you make statements about it.  Here it
is:

"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the secruity of a free State,
the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."

Hmm..doesn't mention anything about war or states involvement in raising a
militia.

> 2 - The citizens have the right to keep and bear arms,

You got this part right.

> 3 - And this right cannot be taken away.

Again...no mention of this.

I'll feel free to ignore your #1 because that's not what the amendment says.
And as for #3...the Constitution is a living document...it changes...the
very fact that this is amendment #2 points that out perfectly...the
Constitution was changed and there is nothing that can absolutely prevent
that in the future.  While it says it "shall not be infringed", it can be
amended.
