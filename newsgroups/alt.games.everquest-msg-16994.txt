First one's free, man.  But please, call it clarity.  I'm a respectable 
enchanter with an image to maintain here...

}Forget the
}epics for the moment and pick, say......... the warrior's crafted armor
}quest. Let's assume for a moment that you're an ubertwink with all the
}cash that normally carries, so you can afford a selection of very
}valuable gemstones to turn in to the centaur.  Now, let's go get your
}breastplate. The talon is no drop. Unless you are talking about somebody
}else turning in the talon for you (in which case, you're not really
}"doing" the quest yourself, are you?) how do you propose to loot that
}talon?

For most of the crafted quests, although admittedly I haven't seen it 
happen with breastplate yet, the item in question is easily obtainable by 
going to the zone in question (in this case Mistmoore) and waiting for 
someone to kill that mob who isn't a warrior and doesn't want the drop.  
Many times, such people shout to the zone about this glorious free thing 
for a crafted quest you can come loot.  So then, it's just a matter of 
convincing someone to follow you around and invis or ivu you as necessary.  

I've noticed that for some reason this seems to be a much more frequent 
occurance with crafted drops than any other quest piece.  It's a funny old 
world.

Now, when you actually turn in the pieces to the centaurs, I wonder if 
you'd get any exp?  I've definitely been too low to get exp on quests 
before.  Very depressing.

Alternately, since you're an uber-twink, it shouldn't be hard to convince 
a cadre of 50th level friends from your guild to escort you in there and 
kill the gypsy musician for you. :)
