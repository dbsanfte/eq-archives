Blessing of Aegolism uses 4 dots.
Ancient: Gift of Aegolism is a 2-dot version of BoA. Hideously difficult to
get however.
Group Symbol uses a single dot, I believe.

Is this spell actually useful for anything?

I've been told that the level 61 rune does not use a component, but I don't
know for sure that it's true.

There are a couple of cleric spells that also use a pearl - the "(chance of)
heal upon death" ones, can't remember the correct names offhand, Divine
Intervention is the level 60 spell I think. But they're so rarely used I
gave my stack of pearls to a guild mage.

There are two different corpse summon spells that use two different types
of coffin.

The various necro and SK pet summons use assorted components. I used to
think it was always various quantities of bone chips...

I believe that both of these have high-level versions which do not need a
component.

There's also the various Imbue spells, of course, which technically
speaking use a reagent.
