hmmmm, I dont recall mentioning risk... and yes, green kills afk reds, whats
your point?

and applying warrens type rules on "1" (one) mob wouldnt change a thing,
except insure that the sk's (who are able to kill the crusader) dont have to
compete with farmers (who kill the crusader with one dd)

so how would sk's get screwed? (well, more than they already are that is ;)

I'm not crying for the class, i'm talking about quests getting fouled up
because levels 50+ are too friggin lazy to go camp their efreeti boots and
want to pay for them with plat (holy shit, there *is* mention of risk!) by
killing greens and sitting around the tunnel in ec

Now if a 50+ Shadowknight is slaying crusaders for darkforge, thats
completely different. Why is it differrent? Read up on their epic.
