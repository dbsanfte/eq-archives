A lot of the servers are twink/PL-only, but you could try the Stromm 
server. The Stromm server was just recently set up, so there are lots of 
people just starting from scratch.

Play a bard IMHO. They are nice soloers, and are very useful in a group too.
They are quite hard to play however.

Who knows?
You will have a better general idea of the workings of a 
Massively-Multiplayer RPG.

Quadding is something you wont do until you are a much higher level, 
dont worry about it. When the time comes, you will be familiar enough to 
do it.
Kiting is fairly straight-forward. It is something soloers do to prevent 
being hit. DoT-kiting is when you snare a mob and load it up with spells 
that do damage over time (50 hp damage every 3 seconds for 30 seconds, 
for example) and then just keep running away from the mob until it dies. 
Fear-kiting is when you cast a fear spell on a mob and then hit it with 
a weapon, get your pet to hit it with a weapon, or just load it up with 
DoTs.
Twinking is just giving one of your characters some equipment that they 
couldnt get for themselves, from a higher-level character.
Blinging?!? Dunno.

All world-wide.
There are some servers for Europeans, Antonius Bayle, Kane Bayle and 
others, and while the players on those servers are mostly European, 
there are people from all over the world there too.

Once they are installed, you will be given an option at the 
server-select screen to activated them with the code on the box.
To use them, just travel to one of the zones in the expansion.

Solo, you are limited to certain zones.
Some soloers do better in certain zones.
Most are better off outdoors where they have plenty of room to keep 
running away from the mobs (wussies).

1. Get ressurected by the cleric/paladin in your party (if there is one).
2. Get a rez from someone else in the same zone.
3. Remember how you got to where you were fighting, and go there again :)

Click on the continent on this page, and click on one of the 
zone-connection maps.

If you are starting off there are good and bad points to being on a 
newbie server.

Good 	
	- Lots of people starting with crappy equipment who wont mind you being 
in crappy equipment and will therefore group with you.
	- Tradeskills are worth working on.
	- There should be more people of your level on the server
	- You will actually get loot at lower levels that you can use
	(something that greatly takes away from the game on older
	servers)

Bad
	-Decent equipment is hard to get and expensive.

No.

>

It depends on the server.
