I dont knoe about anyone else but some times I drop some coin in a newbie
area to 1. lighten the load and 2. let a newbie have a chance of 'finding' a
large stack of coin.

I have never heard of any 'scam' as they called it to make people drop their
coins on the ground.  Sounds to me that it should be a 'player beware'
thing.  How can you trick someone in dropping coin?
