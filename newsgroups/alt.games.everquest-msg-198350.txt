I'd like to hear impressions of the upcoming MMORPG's.

For instance, while I enjoyed the Warcraft games, I think I'm losing my
anticipation for World of Warcraft.  It looks a bit too cartoony.

Everquest 2, however, looks to have very nice visuals.  I know the graphics
aren't everything but if SoE can pull off good game mechanics, EQ2 still
looks to be the one to give the most hope.

Star Wars Galaxies was one I had been greatly looking forward to playing but
my interest has waned somewhat recently.  Because of the non-disclosure
agreement by the beta testers I haven't heard a lot of feedback, but the
various classes seem too linear to me.  Can any characters even solo or is
this strictly a grouping game?  At least in the current EQ I can solo, with
varying degrees of success, with just about any class.  I like to group but
there are times when I want to solo a bit.  Also, I think I'm starting to
prefer the fantasy setting over sci-fi for MMORPG's.  There's just something
about spells going off with all the cool effects that I just don't get tired
of.

Any opinions on these and other upcoming games?  I figure if none of these
game fulfill their potential, I'll just keep playing EQ.
