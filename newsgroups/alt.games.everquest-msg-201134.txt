I have seen this comment several times that mana is free.
It makes me wonder why all the stuff being sold in the bazaar is not being
given away.
The last time I looted a corpse I didn't have to pay to do so.

What people pay for is time and effort and the value of what is received in
return.

Not commenting on what is time , effort or value mainly commenting not to
say spells costs nothing and should be given away free and expect to sell
the drops you have which you also looted free.
