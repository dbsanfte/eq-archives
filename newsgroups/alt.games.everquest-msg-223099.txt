Hi gang!

One of my quests requires that i obtain a Shadow Wolf Paw.  I hung out in
East Commons for 4 hours - tons of Shadow Wolves - no paw drops.

Then, some players told me they don't drop in EC, but they drop in West
Karanas.  A ranger and I ran around in West Karanas for 3 hours and only
tracked a single Shadow Wolf that didn't drop anything at all.

We went to South Karanas.....like in EC, tons of wolves, no paw drops.

Any suggestions for a zone that drops the paw?

Thanks in advance!

Lou
