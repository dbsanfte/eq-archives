Well, forget downtime. There isn't much. And if you do your beginner 
quests, you'll be level 5 in no time at all. There is more downtime than 
the usual PS2 game- BUT compared to the PC- there's none.

They've rearranged a lot of furniture so the getting stuck doesn't 
happen as often. Once you get the hang of the controls and the 
limitations, it can be a fun game.

You can group with 4 people. Your hotkeys are in sets of 4. Get used to 
that, and it's not bad. DO spring for a keyboard, unless you are REALLY 
fast with a controller. Talking to other people sucks otherwise.

Ogres in the new expansion- they can be necromancers. To me, that's just 
not right.
