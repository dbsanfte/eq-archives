Losing my body at level 6 was the best thing that ever happened to me.

First - It had been twinked out by my friend, and all the loot stolen (back
in the days when you could give someone permission to loot.)

Second - It motivated me to find this newsgroup for advice.

I started over, worked my way up from zero, learned to appreciate my gear
and learned how to actually PLAY the game. Sure, some strangers gave me
stuff (which inspired me to do drive-by handouts to struggling newbies to
this day).

It also allowed me to experience the immersive quality of the early game,
when everything is new and you are little more than prey for wandering
Griffawns and Lionesses.

Currently, I have 2 Alts. A MEGA-twinked Iksar SK (for when I'm in an
anti-social mood and just want to solo, RP, and kill stuff). And an
untwinked Kitty Rogue, for when I want to be a vulnerable, stealthy,
questing explorer.

My point being, to really enjoy the game, I think everyone should raise one
char from scratch.
