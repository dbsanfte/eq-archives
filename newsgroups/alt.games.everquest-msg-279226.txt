I am mostly raid equipped with a mixture of elemental, pre-elemental, and 
one piece of single groupable OOW armor, along with mostly LDoN free or 
chaep augments, plus two GoD, available to all single group players 
augments, and one quested augment, the key to VP, and one DoN augment 
(burning affliction 5).  I have zero trouble playing in RSS along with 
other who are comparably, or lesser equipped than that.  In fact, if 
instead, I did nothing but DoN, I would actually have better armor in 
many slots, along with far better augments than I currently have.  What 
single group content is it that you think that cannot be done by non raid 
equipped players?  DoN seriously raised the bar on what a non raid player 
can have equipment wise.

I have yet to find single group content that I, along with a similarly 
equipped group, cannot deal with.  This is speaking as a raider who has 
not made it as far as Time yet, no GoD progression at all.

When PoP came out, I was raiding Velious and Kunark content.  When LDoN 
came out, I was busy raiding things like BoT boss mobs, and lots of 
Velious and Kunark content.  When OOW came out, I was making my way to 
gaining elemental access (got fire shortly after OOW, other elementals 
shortly before), along with still hitting lots of lower tier PoP mobs.  
When DoN came out, I was busy hitting elementals, and working towards 
Time access.  That is where I am today, 3 of 4 elemental bosses down, one 
to go for Time access.  In addition to that, we regularly hit raid level 
OOW mobs that drop Time+ gear, as well as level 69 and 70 runes.

During all this time, I have yet to find any significant amount of single 
group content that was inaccessible at my level of play.

When LDoN came out, it gave non raid players the ability to equip in gear 
that was comparable to, or better than what I had as a non end game 
raider.  When DoN came out, it raised that bar even further, again 
bringing non raiders the ability to equip comparably to non end game 
raiders.

So, exactly which single group content is it that nonraiders are locked 
out of playing in?  Or do you mean that they are locked out until the get 
around to gearing up on readily available single group content, that 
might require them to spend an amount of time similar to what raiders 
have to spend in gearing up?

Seriously, I do want to know what single group content is unavaible to 
someone who does not raid?

PoP is the one expansion I can think of where there was signficant single 
group content that required raiding to gain access to.  Not because it 
necessarilly requires raid available only equipment, but because it 
requires raids for the flags.

Other than PoP, how much single group content is there out there that 
requires raiding to actually be able to access or play effectively in?
