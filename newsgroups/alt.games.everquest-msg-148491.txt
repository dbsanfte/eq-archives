An enchanter mule friend of mine has so-so gear at L60 with KEI. Can do
8 ore enchantments on almost a full bar of mana (about 4 bubs) then has
to med up. This guy wanted you to med back nearly 7k mana. I'd pay 500pp
for that in a heartbeat.

Remember, 2 enchanted ores can make the simpler cultural stuff. Each one
also takes a Blue Diamond. If he's asking for 21 bricks, he already
shelled out 15k+ in BDs, so he's not exactly short on cash. One
successful smithing brellium combine nets you a decent profit (10k or
so)

I've done the enchanting myself, and would NEVER impose on a chanter to
waste that amount of boring time for a bulk chanting session, let alone
baulk at a measly 500pp for the work. Ditto for mana vials, I'll often
buy them readymade to save the time making them.
