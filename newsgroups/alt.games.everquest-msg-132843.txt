Your story about the monocots/dicots made me laugh. A couple of years ago my
kids were studying botany.  While we were walking through town one day
waiting for the tire place to rotate/balance the car's tires, they were
analyzing the leaves of the plants we passed theorizing on whether they were
monocot or dicot.  At one home a landscaper was doing some work.  He was
fascinated by the kids discussion and asked them to explain what they were
doing -- which they did very completely.  He then took some time to show
them the roots of some of the plants he was working with to check their
theorizing, and talked to them more about leave and stem structure.  Didn't
talk down to them at all.  Didn't assume that because they were younger they
wouldn't understand.  It was a wonderful experience.
