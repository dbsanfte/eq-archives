If you're in and around crushbone, one good way to make money is save all
the crushbone belts you get.  Players buy them for a fair few plat when you
have quantities of them.  Once you get higher, keep the legionnare
shoulderpads for the same reason.

I know when I started my first character I barely had any money till level
30 or so, mostly because all I did was go for exp.
