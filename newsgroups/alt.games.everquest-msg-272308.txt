Eh?

Alchemy was the big money skill as of a few weeks ago.   People were striking
it rich mass producing chemicals for others to use.   Pretty much every
tradeskill combine needs another wash / resin / oil / temper thrown in.

Not nearly as fun as selling finished products, but big money.    Although I
suppose its possible competition has driven the sales prices down since then.
(Haven't had much time to play in the last little bit.)
