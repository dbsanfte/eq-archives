Along with keeping Invis memed and hotkeyed.

/pet get lost
/target Dark
/cast 5

If you here the "as you wish" message, duck quick
to interrupt your casting of invis, no reason to waste
the mana.  But that pet -Must- die unless you are sure

in which case leaving it alive might buy you time to
zone, gate, or log out.
