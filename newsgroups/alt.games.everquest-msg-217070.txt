Here's the scoop:

If you are going to buy something from an adventure merchant, you can not
spend more at a time than you have earned at that AM's dungeon. So, from
your example, you have earned 47 points at Miragul, therefore you cannot
spend more than 47 points on a single item at Miragul. The fifteen points
you earned in EF can be spent at Miragul, but since you've only earned 47
points at Miragul's you can't buy a 48 point item.  Or perhaps I
misunderstood, and you're trying to buy a 48 point item in EF, in which case
if you've only ever earned 15 points in EF you need to do quite a few more
adventures there to buy a 48 point item, since you can buy 47 point items at
Miraguls, 15 point items at Rujark, and 15 point items at EF - spend as much
as you like but that's the max you can spend on any single item at those
merchants.

Now, if you're saying that the 15 points you earned in EF weren't credited,
then you have a valid petition there and I hope it gets resolved.
