Just had a couple questions I'd thought I'd ask.

The first is somewhat simple (as compared to the second one I'll get into
shortly).  What is the purpose of Alchohol Tolerance and Alchohol in general
besides just a fun little addition to the game?  I hear rumors that it makes
for a "buff" of some type to melee class characters.  I'm wondering if this
is true, and if so, what exactly is the effect?

Second (and much bigger question):  When it comes to grouping and the
experience bonus, how exactly does this work out?  For example, say that Mob
X gives 200 exp points.  If one person soloing kills Mob X they get 200 xp.
If two people kill it, do they *split* the 200 xp plus whatever group bonus
there is?  Or does each get the full exp plus the bonus?  If it is the first
part, does the xp bonus give 105% of a bonus for example so that the total
experience would be 410 xp points split between the two in effect making the
duo gain more exp for being in a group together than each soloing their own
Mob X?  I understand that in a group you can kill faster with less downtime
(hence the fact that I always like grouping, aside from the purely social
aspect of it all), but does grouping add even more exp to *each* kill?  If
so is there an advantage of a group of 3 over 2, or even more importantly 6
over 5 or less?  I hear about the full group bonus, but I'm wondering how
this all works out.  If anyone knows any actual specifics about this, I
would be most interested to know.  Thank you in advance.
