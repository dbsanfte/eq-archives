I dont know what all the fuss is about with the crashing and stuff.  When
Luclin came out I was playing there with my P3 500 and 8 megs video
ram...oh...and only 128 MEGs of Ram.  And if you seen the recomended
stats...you would know that I was WAY under and it worked fine for me.  It
was about as glitchy as it always was which wasnt that bad.  I think in EQ
though compared to most other online games it is more noticable to the
player because you get into the game more and a glitch no matter how small
can kill your toon.  in other games you might not even notice...even if its
bigger a glitch.
