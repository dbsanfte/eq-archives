a big YUP!!
Songs seem to work for awhile, then they kick off and won't activate for up
to a minute.  Bad news when you're a bard!
I got killed in SK when Selo's kicked off after some donkey dropped some
mummies and dry bones' on me.  Couldn't run away...almost got killed doing
CR after too.

New graphics are cool.  Took a spin in a tiger-dude and was bogged down a
bit in tiger-dude zone.  700p3 should be able to pull this off with almost
1GB of RAM and 64DDR GeForce 2 GTS.  Rest of game seemed OK, except when
zoning in all mobs were suspended high up.  They settle down after a bit.
I hope all this is cleared up soon!
