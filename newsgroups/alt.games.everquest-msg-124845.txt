I've known about this for a long time.  You ever want to have fun, go to a
good bookstore and pick up a reprint of Grimm's Fairy Tales.  If you check
through them carefully, you can make sure you get the older, closer to
original stories.

A quick touchstone to see if the stories are the older ones:  check what
happens to Cinderella's stepsisters.  If one sister cuts off her toes to
fit, and the other cuts off her heel, and both sisters later have their eyes
gouged out by birds, then you've got the older version of the story.

Even more fun is to find the early version(s) of Sleeping Beauty, read them
to your kids, then see how long it takes for Child Welfare to come banging
on your door with a court order.
