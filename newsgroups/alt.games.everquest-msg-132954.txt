If knowingly you take in someone who would normally be too low, you're
aware of the risk and can adjust to it. In my low 50s, I was in a
successful Chardok lev tunnel group with a 49 paladin as the only tank
- we knew his weaknesses and adjusted. 
The cleric and rogue I grouped with in DL who both claimed to be 40+
and then announced, respectively, ding 39 and ding 38 were different
matters entirely. That 37 rogue has later become a fixture on my
avoid-like-the-plague list.
