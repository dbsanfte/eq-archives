I was never one to turn down a 90% rez in the hopes of finding a 96% rez.
Two nights ago I accidentally looted my corpse prior to getting rezzed, 
didn't even blink.  Death has become fairly meaningless when you have 
enough padding into level 65.  I keep 10% going to regular xp, and that 
is enough to make up for any rezzed, and the odd unrezzed death.
