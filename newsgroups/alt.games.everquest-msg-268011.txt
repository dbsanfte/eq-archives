Yes.  A simple Packet of Spice sells for more than the cost of
ingredients bought from the same vendor.  You'll not get rich
doing it, but it pays for skillups.   I managed to level from just
below 4 (right off the island) to about 8.5 for about 1s and
that included buying books -- including buying one twice by
mistake.   So I about broke even.

It seems rather effective to me -- a LOT will depend on whether
anything sells to players (other than spells/abilities), of course.
I haven't considered anything yet because it hasn't been needed;
the quests are good enough at least until 16.   I expect that to
change, but who knows?
