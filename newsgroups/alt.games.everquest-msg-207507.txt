Out of those 400000, how many do you think really actively try to figure 
out a quest vs look it up on allakhazam or some such?  Personally, I'd be 
shocked at 10%, I think that would be a high guess.  I would not be in 
the least bit surprised if there are any number of quests in the game 
that have not been figured out.  Quite likely, at least some of them, due 
to the fact that there is no in game information that would lead you to 
think there is such a quest.
