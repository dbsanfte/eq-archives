	In your dreams.

	I'm going to run amok in every TCC zone they publish, just because I can.
I'll kill every damn mob I can solo just to see if I get a TCC message when it
dies.  If I have to be the one to map them, I will.  (Doubt it though; I
expect Stonebrunt has already been mapped by people on Test and will be
published to web sites as soon as it goes live.  I expect all the low-level
Luclin zones to be mapped and published within a week, two tops, of live.)

	Meanwhile, better organized and/or equipped pharmers (ones who can
two-box) will circumvent the TCC and find out what the drops are.

	The TCC *DOES NOT WORK*.  It just pisses people off by forcing them to
cheat to get around it.
