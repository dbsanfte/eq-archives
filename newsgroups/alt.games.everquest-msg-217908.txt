Don't be silly; two warriors would kill things more than twice as
fast as one warrior (second warrior would do 15% extra damage due
to positioning), meaning they'd take only half the damage from
each mob.  There would also be two of them to bind wounds,
halving down time (quartering it when you consider that its
already been halved by faster killing).  In case of a difficult
mob, taunting could be used to change the mob's focus onto the
less damaged of the pair.  In case of overpull, it should be easy
enough to split the damage, then team up to kill the first and
then the add.  Plus you'd have twice the chance of getting
important procs (snare and so forth) to go off.

No, two warriors as a duo would certainly be better off than two
warriors each soloing.

Bards, on the other hand, I'd be more likely to agree with, their
DOTs don't stack (and there are only 5 of them, quite possible
for one bard to sing all 5) and the far more efficient swarm
kiting can be very messy with -any- partner, as it becomes more
difficult to keep the mobs focussed on target.  A partner -can-
be handy, better than "sit over there with Hide on", but it won't
be more than twice as effective as soloing, and a bard partner
would probably be the least likely to add effectiveness.

Another Loser pairing would be two druids or two wizards; both
solo effectively by quadding, and quadding is even more
vulnerable to the distraction problem than swarm kiting.  At
least the druids can stack DOTs for combined root/rot operations,
though, or combine charmed pets for great fast killing; since
druids don't tend to swarm their pet work tends to stack better. 
And Wizards can Ping Pong a mob back and forth between them...
but both are single target strategies, which doesn't play to
their real strengths.

Lets see, what else.  Paladins would be better off than paired
than soloing for the same reasons as warriors, although less so
since their DW hats won't stack... or will they?  SK will stack
fine, fear kiting would be even simpler to pull off with two
fearers.  Rangers could combine bow kiting with hate kiting, one
running away and plugging with arrows while the other chases and
uses melee.  

Monks would stack like warriors, except that monks have a hard
time soloing at all due to poor damage mitigation and low HP
totals, still, being able to bind up to 70% and being able to
share "tank" duties down to much closer to dead due to FD should
make up for that to some extent.

Rogues suck solo, but a second rogue would do a lot more than
double the kill rate, since he'd not only get the 15% positioning
bonus other melee soloers do, but his BS damage as well; if
rogues -can- solo a mob, 2 rogues would be a vast improvement.

Beastlords wouldn't benefit as much from a second beastlord as
warriors from a second warrior; half their damage output is
already behind the mob (pet).  On the other hand, there's still
the "twice as fast, twice as much healing, quarter the time per
kill cycle" thing to consider.  And they could aggro kite much
better, throwing away only a quarter the DPS instead of half the
DPS (which a aggro kiting solo Beastlord loses)

Who's left?  Clerics.  Ah, well, cleric DOTs stack, so they can
root rot undead together, and cleric nuke and scoot will work a
LOT better if they take turns shooting (in sort of an aggro kite
nuclear pact).  Both of these suffer from the fact that mana used
per kill remains the same, though, so its merely a little bit
better than twice as good, split in half.  Melee cleric duo would
mean whichever one isn't getting hit can heal, taking away the
need to stun to get a heal wedged in, plus two pets, and the same
"half the time to kill a mob so half the damage taken" thing
applies, melee'ing clerics would be a good deal better off paired
than two soloing clerics.  

Shaman.  Root rot stacks just fine, same trouble as cleric plan
of course.  Shaman melee though is a good deal better than cleric
melee, or just let the two pets go to town on their own, while
spending less on slows, dots, heals.

Necromancers and mages, again same story.

Nope, Bards do seem the worst off.
