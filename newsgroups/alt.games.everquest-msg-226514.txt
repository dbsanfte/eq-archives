And your point is?

I'm guessing you want this to mean that they are the best.  But all it 
says it that they are good enough, under the right circumstances.  The 
Spirit of St. Louis made it from North America to Europe, non stop, does 
that mean its the best way to get accross the atlantic?  Or would you 
perhaps vote for a 747 (assuming they aren't showing Biodome as the 
inflight movie)?  Lindy found it good enough... but a nice ocean liner 
would have been a lot less risky.

Further, even if it does mean that paladins are the Best tank for raids 
now, the discussed proposal to make warriors best taunt and best damage 
absorption will certainly alter that equation

If there's a cleric and a paladin in your group, which rez do you want? 
  Especially if the cleric has his clicky stick (which are pretty much 
standard issue nowadays), which do you want, paladin blowing substantial 
amount of his (probably relatively small) mana pool doing it, or cleric 
just clicking it?

That said, you're agreeing with me; they are pretty much the same thing, 
and being able to take either a cleric or paladin to fill the rezzer 
role doubles your options.

Splendid
