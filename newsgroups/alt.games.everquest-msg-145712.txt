Priest changes?  These are all cleric changes.  Looks like the
druid/shaman "incomplete heal" spells are getting a rethink?

Bash... aren't all the level 60s who have already put all their skill points
into learning languages going to be pissed if they can't start this one?
Luckily I have 5 points left over.  Training it up to 165 in combat is sure
going to be a pain though!

Hammer... well frankly unless I"m hunting one of the five undead mobs
in the entire world, that thing is probably going to hang on a wall somewhere.
We shall see, they do say "frequent and powerful proc"

Yaulp V.  Doesn't tell me about stacking.  If it stacks with BAOTR, I
may use it.  If it doesn't, well hey, a use for that new spell delete deal!

Ethereal Elixer.  Doesn't seem too bad.

Ethereal Light.  Bah.

Ethereal Remedy hey, that might be just the ticket, I swear I cast
Remedy more than any other heal these days.  Is it still cheap,
fast, and long range?
