Another part of it is the names.  A few people post the names that they use
in game here, and others such as myself make a point of announcing it when
new people join.  But for a great number of the people in there, I just have
no clue who they are.  (Sometimes until I've been told several times.)

I enjoy chatting with most of the people from the newsgroup on there, but I
like to know who I'm talking to.   BS'ing with random people isn't really my
thing, and while I may know them... if they don't say who they are, I'm
going to have to assume that I don't.

And while others may disagree with me, I don't really consider it all that
polite to grill every person who enters on thier identity, so I kind of tend
to ignore them unless they say something.

Perhaps I'll start adding character name to my posts now.
