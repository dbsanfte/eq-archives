Well - here's the answer I was waiting for:

"Someone will let me know if problems occurr" or even "We have operations
staff who keep an eye on this and they know when things go bad". Heck even a
"I have a canary in a cage by my computer and it's still alive".

In the end he ended up giving me the email addy for the ops staff and I was
able to forward my tracert results through to them. I had been seeing an
extra 5 hops in altnet with reassuring host names like
"diagnosticxxx.altnet...." and the connection kept falling over over
periodically. Eventually I did enough tracerts to catch a few when it had
fallen over and sure enough thats where the problem seemed to arise.

Ops staff were real nice - got me to forward my ipconfig details through and
took over the testing in reverse.They even thanked me for the results.
