ACK!
I had a HUGE reponse that my news client lost due to a crash.

I will try to sum up:

Yes, wizards and druids DID lose something.  Just like if you
have $10 in your wallet, and inflation goes way up, you still
have $10, but it's value has gone down.

The only value to the ports to me personally were so I could
teleport my guildmates around.  I re-rolled my mage as a druid
on FV in large part so I could supply my guild with this service.
Now they don't really need it anymore.  Color me bummed out.  I
feel like I wasted many months of my time.  I wish I had re-rolled
as a DE or iksar necro instead.

Even if druids didn't have ANY ports tomorrow, I'd still think
they are powerful enough.  I'm not demanding compensation, I'm
just bummed over ports becoming...well, like air.  Everyone has
them.  I'll get over it.

And, yes, if I ever stop playing EQ, you can have my stuff.

Personally, I think the PoP ports are a disservice to the young
adventurers.  Exploring Norrath (even if forced!) can be a
wonderful experience!  I think porter NPCs that require platinum
to perform teleports would have been better: the ubahs still get
their ports (translation: less tedium), and some of the magic of
the world isn't sucked out for new adventurers.

All in all, I think SOE has crossed the line with these new
expansion features.  I think it's a clear sign of the beginning
of the end of EQ1.  EQ1 is dead, long live EQ1!

         real-life money" expansion.
