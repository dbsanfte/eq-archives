 I've also turned in lots of salts and skins. It's a painfully boring
process which is why I only do a few hours each time. Like someone else
said, the coin isn't that bad. I can easily walk out with 500p or more.
I'm also not in tha tmuch of a hurry since the Urn from Drusella isn't
exactly common.

 I have a right click dispell item but I don't normally use it. I just
stick with 2hb which seems to kill the buggers fast enough. I can kill
continuously and normally by them time I get down a few bubbles on
health, Mend will be available again.
