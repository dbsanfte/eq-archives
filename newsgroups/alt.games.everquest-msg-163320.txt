I don't know the Zek economies at all, but I would say that you just got a
bazaar kinda deal.

On Povar, Centi LS's have actually been going UP in price. When the Bazaar
first opened, they ran as low as 1200 (rare) and were often around 1500.
Then almost never go below 2K now and are usually more like 2400.
