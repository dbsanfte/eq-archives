Must be something new, then...and I will be the first to admit
I hadn't done this in a long time.  I used to do it when I spent
more time in EC selling stuff, just to avoid the CoF wearing
Priceless Spear weilding level 7 rogue commenting on my
gear.

That was at least 5 months ago, though, so like I said,
something could have changed.

Used to be /role, Iksar form, ToV in the off hand and
a Fool's Gold Stein in the other.  Then I could just
auction with no trouble :-).
