Yes.  Originally, there were 3 big spires (Tox, NK, and GFay), and assorted
pyramids that Wizards could port to.  With Kunark, they added the big spires
in DL, and the *HUGE* spires that don't do anything, also in DL.  With
Velious, they added big spires in GD, that did NOT do anything, plus the
dragon circles, that serverd as both Wizard and Druid port locations.

When they added the Translocate line of spells, the TLs to the big spires
did not require a component, whereas the TLs to the pyramids require a small
portal fragment.  The idea, apparently, is that the big spires are more
powerful, and so you don't need to component to use them.

They probably should have made it so that the ports to Luclin used the
*HUGE* spires in DL, rather than the big spires, but that would have been
too annoying to have only one place on Norrath to use for Luclin trips.

I don't know if they've explained in any in-game way why the GD big spire
doesn't have a Wizard port associated with it.

Oasis: yes.  NRo: no, I believe.  NRo got its dock when Velious came out.

Before Kunark, the Oasis dock was just decorative (as far as players
go...who knows if they planned it to be used in an expansion back when they
first designed Oasis?)

Actually, Paineel was also an expansion zone, introduced after the game was
released.  Originally, the evil Erudites were in
whatever-that-stupid-city-is-called, just like the good ones.  The area in
Paineel that goes to the Warrens (and the Hole) was there when Paineel was
introduced.  I don't remember what the area where it goes to the Warrens
looked like.  The place that went to the Hole was basically just a dead end.
(Before the Hole, jumping off the cliff in Paineel took you to Tox).

So, more than half that continent (by zones) has been optional expansions:
it started with the one city, Tox, and that Kerran zone, and then got
Paineel, then the Hole, then the Warrens, and then Stonebrunt.
