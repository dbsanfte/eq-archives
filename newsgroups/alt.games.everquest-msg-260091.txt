Probably was Butterflies, there was a pilot for an American version of it 
made in 1979, description from IMDB is:

"Pilot for a failed sitcom based on the better-known British sitcom 
starring Wendy Craig and Geoffrey Palmer about a bored housewife seeking 
excitement through an extramarital affair."

British series ran from 1978 to 1983, does not appear to be available on 
Netflix, unlike most of the others I've looked for.

Red Dwarf, Are You Being Served, Fawlty Towers, Dr Who, and much more is 
all available on Netflix too.  :b

As you can probably tell, I've become quite the fan of Netflix.
