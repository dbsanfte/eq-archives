You are wrong, it all depends on the person doing the talking.  Not
that I recommend being an ass but it doesn't really matter if you're
willing to keep pushing it up the chain.  Sooner or later you'll get
to someone who can easily solve it and doesn't want to be bothered
anymore; and certainly doesn't want your call to go any higher than it
already has.  Sony is a public company and so has stock holders to
answer to.  If you push a problem high enough I guarentee it will be
solved the way you want whether you are an ass or not.
Customer Service is exactly that, and they have to escalate your call
if you insist on it.  It's people who behave aggressively in the
beginning but don't have the nuts to see it through who get screwed.

Private companies are a whole 'nother story of course.
