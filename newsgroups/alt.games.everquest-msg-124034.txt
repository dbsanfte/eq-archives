GSD just isn't good enough stats-wise, even with the focus effect, at least
in my opinion.  You're right about the Robe of Enshroudment, though, what
graphic does that one have?

The OP got a Crystalline Robe, which is a good choice, even with no effect,
and it does look cool on a Dark Elf.  I hadn't looked at an Oracle or
Advisor robe since the foci went in, it's strange that the Advisor robe
didn't even get an effect.  Also, I think a level II effect would have been
nicer on the Oracle robe, I still see lots of casters wearing one way past
level 20 on my server.
