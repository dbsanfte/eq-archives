Well, in later levels, shamans actually do need decent AC, because our
spells tend to agro.  At level, assuming you are soloing, is slow, tainted
breath, sicken, and melee.  of course you can always stand back and root and
let the DoT's do their damage, but A) it takes longer, and B) your melee
skills don't go up.  I'm sure you know that the initial damage of a DoT and
any DD you cast (spirit strike, say) gives a chance of breaking root, so if
you do want to stand back, pull with slow, DoT while taking a couple hits,
root, then stand back and sit down to med.  Some of the totemic armor you
can start working on, or actually buy very cheap now-a-days.  I remember the
days when totemic was uber. =0P.. spent 9 months saving up for my shaman's
jaundiced bone bracer, such a nice item.  Good luck, I hope you can get some
item suggestions.  If you can get to bazaar, go up there just to look at
what is available item wise, it's a good source of knowledge, and it isn't
like you have to buy anything.. just drool a little.
