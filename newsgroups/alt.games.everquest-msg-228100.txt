I really wish that if people want to have a fruitful conversation on this
topic that they'd drop the insulting acronyms in this discussion.

When you call it "Greed before Need", making anyone who supports it
immediately out to be a selfish, heartless jerk who would take things from
the needy because they just like having stuff, well, it's kind of difficult
to have an open and honest conversation on this issue.

It's like me deciding that full random's going to be called "Fair Loot",
because everyone there has exactly the same chance on each item as everyone
else, and if you don't agree, you support a system of "Unfair Loot".  That's
a nice way to denigrate someone's opinion.

And it may just be my experience, but every single huge loot bitch on a
messageboard I've ever seen came out of someone complaining that a priest
rolled on a haste item against melees, or something along similar lines.

And who's the arbiter of these rules?  Who decided that wanting a charisma
upgrade for merchant prices, or a wisdom/intelligence upgrade for
tradeskills, was not a sufficient "need" to qualify for "need before greed"?
