    Sure but before the patch monks used to drive me batshit tanking as good
or better in groups. And don't get me started on iksar monks, particularly
twinked iksar monks. You can't tell me that wasn't a savage rort :)

    After the patch, monks do their job and generally appreciate me keeping
agro off them, as do the clerics. Hopefully without seeming glib, I think my
experience at the mid levels of post-nerf monks is very likely more accurate
than your own. I would suggest, addmitedly without experience of the high
end game, that your AA and ludicously uber gear, hey possibly even leet
skillz0r i don't know, allowed you to eat the nerf without slowing down too
much. *or* sony have missed the boat and failed to nerf the top end enough.
What I *do* know for certain, because it's their written position on the
matter, is that their intention is not for monks to tank nearly as well as a
knight or warrior.

Cheers,
James
