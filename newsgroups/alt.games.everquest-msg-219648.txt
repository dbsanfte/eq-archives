Wow is that a strawman I see before me?

No one is "deeming" pets as unworthy of parenthood. I don't
spay/neuter my pets because I deemed them unworthy of reproducing. I
do it, because they are driven by instinct to reproduce, and I cannot
gaurantee that they will never get the chance no matter how
responsible I am as a pet owner. The fact is that there are more cats
and dogs being produced than homes to take them in. Spaying/Neutering
is infinately more humane than what is done to cats and dogs every day
in shelters due to overpopulation.

I would rather see state mandated sterilization than millions of
abortions each year. Far too many people are just as "dumb" as animals
when it comes to reproductive habits. People can't control themselves
or their kids, and you expect them to be "responsible" enough to
control their pets? /rollseyes
