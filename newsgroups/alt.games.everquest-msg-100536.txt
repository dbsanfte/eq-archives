See, if the experience grind bothered me, I simply wouldn't do it (and
many times I've gone months without leveling, and still had a ball).
What sort of things do you do for fun, right now, with a level 60

to do those exact same things. Just because a higher level exists
doesn't mean you have to strive for it.
