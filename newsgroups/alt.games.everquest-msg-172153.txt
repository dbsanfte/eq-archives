There are three types of haste: Item haste, Spell haste, and *Song haste.

*song haste is a special category, most haste songs fall in the "spell haste"
category,
and do not stack with chanter/shaman hastes.

Item haste+Spell haste has a cap.

Song haste does not apply towards that cap, nor is it limited by the cap.

Items which proc haste are not proccing "item haste" they are proccing either
"spell haste" or "song haste".

I'm not certain what happens with "whistling fists" but I'm willing to bet it is
"song haste" (ie same line as Melody of E. and Battlecry of Vah Shir etc.).
This would mean it would stack with chanter/shaman/beastlord hastes, and with
normal bard haste.

The top "song haste" is a mere 25%, this is a level 60 song, though, so noone in
that target group (max level 40) is ever going to see this song.  In fact, they
aren't even going to be getting the 5% "song haste" song.  At level 40, the only
best bard derived haste available is a 20%  "spell haste" song.  I'm not sure
what the enchanter would be casting by that point, but I'll wager its better
than a 20% haste, and the bard would be better off singing something else,
unless the group is really hungry for some agility and a tiny boost in AC.

As with any hybrid, bards can provide services if specialists aren't available,
but usually should be doing something else if a "real" haster/slower is
available.  Oddly, though, I've actually found bard slower to be an excellent
plan despite far better slows being available, bard slow is very low aggro, so I
can partially slow a mob and let the MA build up a nice healthy aggro up before
someone casts a real slow.  There's no mana cost to bard slow so there's nothing
wasted really.

I don't know anything about slow stacking.  Bard slows come in two flavors, one
is a combination slow/snare line, another is a combination slow/dot PB AE line.
Since both of these have a feature other than slow, the fact that they are
compatible with spell slows does not mean that the slows themselves stack.  I'd
guess that only the best slow actually affects the target.  Since I very
frequently use the snare/slow on targets which are chanter slowed, I'd think
we'd notice an extra 30% worth of slowness if the slow part stacked.  I've never
used the AE slow line much, not at all in a group, so its Possible that this
would stack, if so it would revolutionize bard desirablilty in the same way that
the "song haste" stacking feature does.
