Thanks to all for their responses.

Perhaps they have made a general change to forage refresh. I have never
actually timed it but I know for sure that it is refreshing a lot quicker
for her now than it used to. In a full med she can forage at least three
times whereas she was lucky if she could do it more than once before and
there is barely any difference in the med time now, if anything it is
shorter than it used to be.
