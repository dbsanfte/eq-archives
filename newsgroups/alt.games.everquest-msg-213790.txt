    My story for today, there I was happily soloing when a low lvl player
ask for a buff.  They asked a few questions about the zone they were in and
I gave a few playing tips.  After an hour sending tells back a forth, I
started to get details about this person.

    First was the fact that it was a girl who was fifteen.  She had lost her
old account and was playing on her brother-in-laws.  Her old account was
frozen because she couldn't pay for her ISPand EQ.  She didn't have the
money because she didn't get paid for work.  Her work wasn't a real job, so
she couldn't complain to anyone about not getting paid.  The work she did
was working in the movies for her brother-in-law.  It was okay that she
didn't get paid because they were x-rated movies and she didn't want anyone
to think of her as a whore.  Now that she had told me about herself, she
wanted to know more about me.

    At this point, I said "lets just play EQ", and surprise, surprise, she
had to logoff soon after that.

    Some days, dealing with elves, trolls and gnomes seems easier than
dealing with people.
