It is, however, she was offering you sound advice.  If it does really bother
you as much as it appears to, you really will be better off to not bother
with the tradeskills.  If, on the other hand, like me, you are willing to
live with a system that you are unhappy with, because it does bring enough
added value to your game, then, by all means go for it, and rant away.  Do
expect others to disagree with you, much as always happens here on just
about any subject.
