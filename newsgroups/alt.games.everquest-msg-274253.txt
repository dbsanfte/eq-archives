As a scout, my primary stat is agility.  Now, I know that agility is
factored into the frequency of giving and receiving hits.  One thing
I'm not sure about is its contribution to damage.

Just looking at the numbers as they float over the target, it seems to
me that I do more damage per hit with higher agility.  We were in a
group in RV and the topic came up, and I said that I thought agility
contributed a lot more to damage than strength did for a scout.  A
couple of the non-scouts disagreed, but the other scouts were split on
it.  A few other higher-level assassins seemed to think that agility
contributed more than strength, but nobody has parsed it.

Does anybody have a feeling on how agility contributes to the damage
per hit (for scouts specifically, but all classes in general)?  I
haven't parsed it because of the difficulty in decoupling agility and
strength in items.  I think my self-buffs only affect agility.  That
would lead me to believe it is primarily agility-based, I haven't
really paid attention to my strength when big hits were taking place
though.
