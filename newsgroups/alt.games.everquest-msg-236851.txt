Last night I was in befallen killing whatever wouldn't kill me
first...
Eventually a ghost popped up and asked me to do him a favor (it's alot
longer than that but you get the point) anyways, I took his note and
his bridle, then decided to explore a little further.  Anyways I got
swarmed and died.

I asked someone to please help me, and lo and behold a lvl 65 shammy
came and cleaned out the dungeon for me, and helped me get my corpse.

I was so excited I decided to stay and explore a little longer.  Just
to be wise I decided to cast invis on myself so they couldn't see me
if they respawned.

About 10 minutes later a mummy starts whacking away at me, he hits me
SO hard I died in no time flat.

My invis didn't drop, it just doesn't work against undead.

Doh!

Anyone else?
