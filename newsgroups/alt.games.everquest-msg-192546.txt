So this morning I was on with my main, Teafang.  I had stocked up
Teasale with dyes, and was looking for some new adventure to
have.  

   I know... I'll go see if I can take the evil eyes in the
Beholder's maze.  So I make the journey there, and the middle eye
is up.  It cons white to me, and I am a bit nervous since it is
an enchanter.  But I decided to give it a go.  

   Big mistake.  It dispells my pet almost immediately *Blink*
They can do that that?  D'oh!  And then keeps me charmed and
mezzed and what not.  After a nice long time of this, I go link
dead.  I try to log on after a suitable wait... and find that the
system thinks I still have an active character on.  I so start
doing /who all teafang with my baraar mule on a different
account...  still seeing me on.   My husband went to go look for
me; neither me or the middle eye are anywhere to be seen in the
maze.  I turned off both computers and took a nap.  Woke up, had
a bite to eat.  It's now six hour laters... and Teafang is still
showing as being online.  I have a petition in queue with my
trader... hopefully that will give some love.

   So any ideas on what is going on?  Could I be alive, under the
world, being forced to give that ghastly thing foot rubs?  Will I
not be able to get my character on till the server goes down? 
And if I did die under the world, however will I get my body? 
Has anyone ever had anything like this happen to them?

Annie
