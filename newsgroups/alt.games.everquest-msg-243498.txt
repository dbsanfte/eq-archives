Decent gear compared to whom?  If you want the same quality of gear as
someone in a  raiding guild, then join a raiding guild, but don't expect to
get it out of the bazzar.  Do you really think that everyone who is wearing
ornate armor went out and bought plat to buy the armor?  If you want ornate,
go out and get it. Do not, however, complain because someone in the bazaar
is selling some mold for 50000k.  Items aren't just conjured up out of the
ether and put up for sale.  Someone killed a mob and got the drop.  That
means you could go kill the same mob and get the same drop.  If you aren't
capable of killing said mob, then you don't really deserve the armor.

I personally do not think that if there were no one selling plat prices
would be dramatically cheaper.  I can earn a few k in vendor trash just
doing solo xp.  So, if I wanted to buy a piece of ornate, I could earn the
money in say 1 months time from just soloing for xp and vendoring the drops.
If I really wanted to get some new armor, I could forgo the xp and focus on
just farming mobs with drops that sell for large sums of cash to vendors and
afford a new piece in say 1.5 -2 weeks.  Thereby I earn enough money to pay
for new armor without haveing to involve myself in anyway with out-of-game
plat sales.    You want the game economy to be divorced from that of the
real world, which I would agree with, however that doesn't mean getting
something for nothing.  Earn the plat or gear in-game and put in the time to
do so.

Exactly.  We all live in the same economy and there are people out there
playing with good gear because they earned it.
