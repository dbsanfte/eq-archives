Just as a suggestion, open your system video properties and try reducing the
hardware accelleration one notch.  I had similar problems with a mouse and
did that and it worked.  When you knock it down a click, it will say "use
this setting when having video problems like mouse pointers" or something to
that effect.

Good luck,
Sean...
