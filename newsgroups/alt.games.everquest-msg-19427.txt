But the fact that bards can (with ease) out-run a druid somewhat makes up
for this.

>I don't think a bard would do to well against a caster. 

Seen the PvP servers recently? Bards dominate. A mediocre bard player can
crush a very talented anything-else. Casters especially. The big problem is
that you just cannot effectively land spells on bards. Their resists are
too good. The big one for druids is magic resist (for the snares)...and
even in the high 20s, with a tiny smidgeon of MR equipment, a bard is
immune to any magic-based spell that a druid can have.

Kiting an un-snared bard is an excersize in futility.

A druid meleeing (with typically horrible druid melee skills) against the
dual wielding, plate wearing, better skilled, superior hitpointed bard is
in a losing battle.

You can't do a war of attrition with a bard, because the bard has infinite
resources, and will wear anyone down.

I've played with bards who could maintain 4 1/2 songs constantly...that's
enough for magic defense, haste, snare-target, and another song of your own
choice....granted most people can only really expect to twist 3.

The only classes with a small chance to beat him are shamans (with a pet,
good melee of their own, resist-lowering spells, and devastating spells in
4 of the 5 resist types, making shaman spells hard to defense), and wizards
(who with luck can lure his way through the bard's resistances before he
gets cut down).
