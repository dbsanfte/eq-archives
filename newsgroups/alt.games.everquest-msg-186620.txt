Given you obviously like Luclin you could try The Grey. Loot is
absolute shit but the exp rolls in nicely. Don't forget your fbe or
some fishscales.

Perhaps ME too? It used to be the natural evolutionary step after
Dawnshroud before PoP.

BW is the right level, but I haven't seriously exped there (besides
with an enchanter soloing, that doesn't count) since before Velious,
can't accurately say if it is good exp anymore or not. You did say you
hated CoM though and the mobs in BW are rather similar to them.

Theres always the bats and bugs in SolB.
