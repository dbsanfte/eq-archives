    Best thing to do for any equipment need is to scan the bazaar. Look for
items your race/class with stat AC. Narrow it by searching once per slot,
you will quickly see items which stand out as being good for your price
range. A few days of doing that and you can pick each item up in its
low-price fluctuation.
