You know... I really do have to appologize.    I shouldn't have said we were
done here.   I should have considered the possiblity that I would be amused
enough by your ignorance to post again.

First of all I've seen a lot of talk about your logs "proving" you right.
Yet I haven't seen any logs.  Just your assertations that they do.
Secondly, I'm not sure exactly what you intend to "prove" with these logs.
You've made the claim repeatedly that you are not mana constrained in these
groups, but rather aggro constrained.   You're making the claim (IMO the
ridiculous claim) that for a significant portion of each battle, you're
sitting there full mana doing nothing.   So at most, your logs will prove
that a melee will do more damage than a caster that doesnt' nuke.
Personally I believe that falls into the "well, duh." catagory.

If you really are that aggro constrained in a normal experience group, then
there is something seriously wrong with your playstyle.   You need to learn
how to manage your aggro better.   (1)


(1) I would have added "Or stop grouping with underequipped tanks that can't
hold aggro"  but according to what you're claiming, they're massively
outdamaging you.   Damage creates aggro, so therefore either they're holding
aggro just fine and you're an idiot for not nuking, or they're not doing
that much damage, and you're purposefully misrepresenting the situation.
