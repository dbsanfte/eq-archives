This isn't at all an uncommon thing. :)

What happened is that an Enchanter used the Minor Illusion spell (which
turns them into a nearby inanimate object) to make themselves look like a
torch, and then proceeded to die. The corpse doesn't revert back to the
Enchanter's original race, so you have torches (or trees/bushes, coins prior
to the last patch, etc) that when clicked on, are actually corpses.

Same thing happens with druids who die while in Treeform - their corpse will
remain behind as a tree.
