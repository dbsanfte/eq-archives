    I dont think so. To haul in the same amount of exxy as a group of nukers
and melee they'd have to be handling several mobs at once, because dots are
slow as a wet week. So what? Well, itd take tactics and group coordination,
two things totally lacking from almost every group I've been in. (minus a
few shining exceptions :)

    Still, I'm definitely sharing your view, that's how I *thought* the game
would end up! But instead its melee dominated and casters largely augment
melee's abilities... that's in the 40's havent got higher yet.
