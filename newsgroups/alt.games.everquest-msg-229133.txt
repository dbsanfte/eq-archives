Yes.  I noted just that, when I posted it.  It's even still in the text you
left quoted.  I never meant to imply any correllation with the ebay debates.
I just thought the article interesting for a worldwide gaming newsgroup.  It
shows that the internet gaming industry is going strong in china.  I had
heard that of korea and of asia in general but never of china.  It also
shows that the chinese courts do have intelligent consideration of the finer
points of property ownership, even to the point of giving consideration to
virtual property.  Seems like they do have much in common with us.  I might
not even expect our own courts to do as well of a job.
