I don't think that's so absurd.  *If* someone says "porting for
donations", i.e. an unspecified amount, it's not unacceptable to offer
a pittance.  It's a donation, not an agreed price.  If you want to
offer your services, be it porting, rezzing, SoW'ing, clarity etc., and
want a good price, then it's not so hard to put that price in your
offer of services.

Sure, it's their option to blow you off, but someone who offers a
service and then changes the deal when the offer is taken up will
eventually build up a reputation as a person not worth doing business
with.

(Personally speaking, I'd never offer less than 20pp for a port, and
sometimes offer 50pp if I need to get somewhere quickly)
