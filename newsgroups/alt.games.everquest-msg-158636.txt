Using /raid with 10 people, I got almost 3 blues in 2 hours at level 56 in
Plane of Disease.  If I had been there in a single group with the group
bonus, and no /raid penalty, it would have moved a lot faster.  This was
just killing regular mobs there, various Underbulks and Lightcrawlers.  Oh,
BTW, the loot sucked.  We got no plat, and sold the crap for around 60 plat
total.
