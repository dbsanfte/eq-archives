If you don't like getting killed horribly, then take a few safeguards. Then,
clueless, stupid ebayers would only be able to group with other clueless,
stupid ebayers.

Death is a risk you take every time you group, in fact it is a risk you take
every time you play. My advice would be, be wary of those people that you
choose to group with. Especially if you don't know them. It is not only
e-bayers that are clueless.

How long does it take to work out that the person you are grouped with, has
no idea what he is supposed to be doing?

If you do know it is a clueless e-bayer, then you can punish them by making
it known, so that no-one groups with them. If they admit they bought the
account, you can petition them.
