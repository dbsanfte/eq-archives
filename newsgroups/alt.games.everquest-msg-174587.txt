Progressed far enough on my epic chase to be at the point where I need
to do Ixiblat.

I don't think I'm gonna solo this one...

Done a little reading and research (ok, not nearly enough) and figured
I'd just ask here for advice or tips on pulling this one off without
getting everyone I know killed.

My guild has a core of folks around my level (early to mid 50s) and
some decent allies, but we don't have any 60+ in guild.  Maybe some
friends we can borrow.  So any guesses on what sort of group count I'm
looking for?

Any strategy tips?  I've heard form the 'ubahs' that this isn't a big
deal... but to us, it still is a big deal indeed!
