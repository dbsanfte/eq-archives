For me, shrouding feels even worse than running an alt.  It's like
running an alt that can't even do everything an alt could (like use
most gear, for starters; or choose which spells to load, etc.).

I think PoR had been out for a while before I caved in and bought
DoDH (and PoR).  The DoDH content was, as usual, too high level for
me (and mostly still is, even at 68, because nobody else is doing
the content now and soloing it at 68 isn't very practical), and the
other Big New Thing in the expansion was the shrouds and monster
missions, which I still find appallingly dull.

Some of them are a fun-once, like the zombie mission in Rivervale.
But mostly, I have the characters I do because I like playing them
and improving their skills (and mine).  I don't *want* to dress up
as a goblin and be a rogue, or a fairy ranger, or whatever. If I
want to play a rogue or ranger, I'd rather start an alt and do it
"for real".  And this is especially true if there are people I
regularly group with and we've gotten good at coordinating our
skills; why would we want to suddenly throw all those skills away
and flail around trying to learn how to play monsters?

I can see how people who've been playing EQ for 8 years might find
the monster forms novel, and I suppose some folks have a mindset
that says "oo, I can play a monster, how cool", but frankly I'm
already playing a lizardman, how much more monstrous can you get? :P

Anyway, I've used the shrouds mostly for rogue-sneaking through
parts of the DoDH and TSS exploration quests, and once or twice to
preserve some buffs (though now that the guild lobby freezes buff
timers there's less reason for unguilded characters to use shrouds
for this purpose) or a pet (but the SK and druid pets are both so
gimp that I don't usually bother to buy them any fancy gear), but
other than that both the shrouds and the MMs are just wasted bucks.

And yes, per later posts in the thread, I'm not at all surprised
that they nerfed shroud xp carrying back to your main.  Otherwise
you'd have people taking level 5 shrouds and PLing them through
what would normally be several levels of xp, and then unshrouding
and expecting to have gone from level 65 to 75.  Sh'yeah right!

What I wish they'd do more of is the instanced missions where you
play your real characters, like Qeynos: Sleeping on the Job or
Unrest: The Curse Begins.  Missions where there's a fixed goal
instead of just killing for xp or camping for a rare spawn or drop,
where the story lines and tactics are more interesting than in
LDONs, and yet the levels of the mobs can be adjusted to suit a
range of character levels.
