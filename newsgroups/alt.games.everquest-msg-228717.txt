... not debating the DPS of a 65 ranger with good AAs and an elemental
bow (at least when they can use archery), I was just pointing out that
I don't think ranger DPS is 'all that' before then.

I had one of those, rotting in the bank because of the recommended lvl
on it. ... then someone pointed out that the rec. lvl for weapon
damage was broken <sigh>. Ah well, never got around to parsing it to
double check. 

Out of curiosity, what weapons is your BL using? I'm debating bringing
my monk out of retirement and could use the insight. He was retired
long before the monk nerf so is gonna need a lot of lovin to get up to
decent gear. Still using things like Froggie crown, azure sleeves, orc
fang earrings... His prized posessions are a flayed Pabaela tunic and
a thurg quest bracer <g>. I'm fixing to hit the road for a couple of
weeks but was planning to look at the monk (and melee changes)
seriously when I got back.

That's always been my problem with raids. The good raid guilds that I
might enjoy want you to be raiding full time when you're online, not
something I want to do. The casual raid guilds just can't seem to get
organized and I hate sitting around waiting.
