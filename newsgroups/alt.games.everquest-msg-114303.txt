I'm only saying that, when applying major patches which could prevent 
customers from playing for days on end, they should rotate the patch 
time to be fair. The way it is now they continually patch at the same 
time, which means a proportion of people are ALWAYS going to bear the 
brunt of their mistakes. This may inconvenience the fewest number of 
people, but it inconveniences one particular group of people who can 
only play at this time each and every single time there is a patch. How 
is this fair?
