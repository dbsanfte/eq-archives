}Me: "You just came by at the right time"
}Him: "Have you got some realy good armor for me?"
}Me: "Ahhh wrong answer"

}Him in tell: "Wait a minute, you can't walk away from me like that"
}Me in tell: "Sir, I am free to do as I please"

Hehe, yep.  That's why, when camping newbies, I usually give them the item 
and click trade before they get the chance to say something stupid and 
piss me off.  Otherwise, I end up encumbered with half a ton of stuff I 
couldn't find a deserving recipient for. :)

Besides, I like the idea of them zoning in from character creation, and 
finding the trade window already open with some freshly-tailored 
reinforced armor in it.  Who knows?  It means they've already been given 
one example of good things happening without them asking the whole zone 
in /shout. :)
