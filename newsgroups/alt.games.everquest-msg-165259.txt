That's just because you approached your Druid from the wrong
perspective.  Having spent over three years playing a hybrid
who still can't solo worth a damn (as far as gaining xp goes)
even after several substantial improvements via patches, all
I've got to say is that playing my Druid on FV is pure fun.
I die way less often, my CRs are far shorter, I can goof around
and not pay much attention at all to how efficient my tactics
are and still gain xp far faster than any melee at equivalent
level.  And as for those Druids who fear dungeons, you guys
just don't know what you're missing, Druids solo and group very
nicely in dungeons too.  Anybody who turns playing a Druid into
"work" is seriously shortchanging themselves.
