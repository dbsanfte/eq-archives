From experience I also believe that a 4th level corpse lasts well over the
30 mins mark. This would make sense as at 4th you start to lose exp on
deaths and also no longer get your starting equipment (tome of discord and
all) upon respawning.
Saying this I still do not twink until 6th (rather be safe than out of
pocket)
