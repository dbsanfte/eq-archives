I don't have a problem with that at all.  So long as the person has the cash
there with them to pay for them.  I still think it's a pain in the hiney.  ML
announces what each gem is worth, adds them all up, trades them to the guy for
plat.  Same with words and whatever else people want.  Now you're talking
another 10 or 20 minutes to divvy up after the adventure is over.  So long as
the group doesn't mind waiting I sure don't have a problem with it.
But I would not be surprised if there was a lot of whining.  Especially in
pickup groups.
