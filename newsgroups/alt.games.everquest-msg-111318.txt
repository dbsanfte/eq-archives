How many remember to the old days of being a New Player on a New Server?
Most everyone running around killing rats, snakes, bats, and such, afraid to
get too far away from the guards. Corpse runs had to be done in 30 minutes
or you lost all your rusty weapons and bone chips. Having to loot everything
you can just to be able to buy food and drink. The first time someone cast a
Sow on you or a damage shield. Being ever so proud of that fine steel weapon
you just looted, silver jewelry was the hot ticket for casters and healers.
Taking forever to get to level 20 because you all you did was group just to
stay alive.
