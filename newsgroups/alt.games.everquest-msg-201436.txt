I'm surprised no-one has replied with this yet, but you DON'T
need to pay anything for the game to get access to the 30 day
trial, the "old-world" (which constitutes about half of the game
you'd be able to get access to in 2 weeks of average play)
is available for download from www.everquest.com . Just
bear in mind that since that version of the game there have been
myriad improvements... it's enough to get a feel for the game
though, and if you decide you like it just buy a copy of EQ and
install it over the top of it.
