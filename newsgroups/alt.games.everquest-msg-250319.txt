Yeh, mobs ignoring z-axis is one of those 'gameplay' things, not a bug.  
If mobs -couldn't- leap tall buildings in a single bound, any class that 
can nuke or otherwise do damage at a distance could get up on a tower and 
kil mobs that could never fight back to their heart's content.  Realistic, 
but kinda ruins the game.

They're across the street from my old lab.  I used to have such a crush on 
their web designer.  *sigh*...
 
It does look like their plan might take a lot of the fun out of flying, 
though.  Everything is on autopilot.

}Tempest was mine. That and Centipede. Used up lots of my quarters.

Ohh, Tempest is good!  Have you heard of MAME?  I've been wanting to get a 
paddle control for my PC just so I can more realistically emulate Tempest.  
Although it ain't so bad with arrow keys either. :)

}] Sure, they could.  I'd even think it would mostly be a good idea.  The

}Well, a delay could be built-in. I just want to be able to do it

Actually... are we talking about actually moving weapons from one slot to 
another, or just switching from melee attack to ranged attack?  Because 
that latter -is- pretty easy, and I don't really see the basis for the 
complaint...  Just move the ranged attack button from your combat button 
window to the hotkey tray.  Hit attack off, switch to the mob you want to 
ranged attack (which is generally -not- the one you were just pounding 
on, since he's too close. :) ), hit ranged attack.  No problem?

}They could stick in a 2 second delay at first level.

Sure, a delay that scales with level maybe.

}] I'll deal with the one that exists.
}And reduce the time slightly, and reduce the chance of dropping the
}weapon... make it a skill level thing.

Erk, another skill to work up?  I can just see characters standing around 
mashing the 'change weapons' button over and over. :)  It's as bad as the 
old monk standing in a corner doing a fancy kick, flopping on his side, 
stand up, repeat. :)

}] }I didn't specify an amount of time for the weapon change. Where you

}] One second?  That's like, practically forever!  That's a good quarter of a

}] heavily-hasted types with fast weapons.  
}Hmm.So we mere non-bards can do it in one second, but a Bard takes
}just 3 notes ? ( Sorry, old 'Name that Tune' game show reference.)

Heheh.  My bard would -love- a change instruments hotkey.  Just absolutely 
love.
