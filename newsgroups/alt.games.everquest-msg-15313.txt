1 is true, absolutely.  HQ bear skins go for 2 or 3 plat to anyone who
has it.  
2 isn't true.  There are many people trying to become the first master
tailor.  On Torv, I was one of the first 3 to be making and selling
Backpacks.  I was also the first and only tailor in the qeynos area.  I
was able to sell Patchwork for 1gp per ac.  Why?? because It was the
best and cheapest stuff out there.
