Well sure, I noted the same sentiment elsewhere; if "near my level" 
means 5 or 10 points above it, then its not useful for skill ups as I 
currently do them; I pick something cheap 50 or 100 points above my 
level and do them over and over till they trivial out.

I -might- however, change that tactic, if it means I can get supplies 
for 20 tries, do 20 clicks, skill up to the next trivial, then switch to 
the new item; spending more pp in order to vastly reduce the number of 
clicks needed may be a worthwhile tradeoff.

This isn't the same question, though, as the one addressed here, which 
was someone saying that limiting things to just a bit above your skill 
level would keep recipies a secret.  250 skill people will be able and 
willing to post every formula out there, so they'll be just as well 
known as all the ones currently out there on EQtraders and the like.

Splendid
