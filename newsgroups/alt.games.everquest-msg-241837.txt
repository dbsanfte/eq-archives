Not entirely true. They have been discussing the shift to DX9 for 
several months....at least 3 that I can think of offhand. If I didn't 
have a houseful of people starting to arrive for brunch in half an hour, 
I would google eqlive for the information. I think it even dates back to 
as early as november. I am pretty certain that someone will also respond 
with the information=)

[and if you are going to continue the discussion, would you consider 
bottom posting in accordance with the FAQ? Even though most people are 
probably ignoring this thread, it would be nice=)]
