Taking that as an assumption, with my experience,  I level
as fast and can solo a lot better.   Of course I solo'd my
cleric in EQ at that time -- my wizard solo'd later, with
KEI, during that level range...

In EQ2, assuming I actually spend time killing things and
not doing quests or harvesting (other than downtime) or
exploring, I can get a level or more a night (~3 hours.)

Any faster and I'd not experience a lot of content.  More
to the point, I think THAT should be the actual "question"
anyway:

Do you level so slow you end up "grinding" on the same mobs
(boring) or so fast you don't experience a lot of content (where
you're "racing" without trying)?

The answer to that -- in my experience -- has been a
bit on the fast side.  There's been quite a few mobs I
didn't fight and areas I didn't explore when they were
challenging simply because I out-leveled them, all without
more than a couple of hours (if that) of full groups.
