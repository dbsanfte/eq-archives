They need to check their clocks at SOE.  For several hours last
night they warned about the servers coming down at 3PST, but
Quellious was given a hard shutdown at 2:55.  Dangit, some of
us were counting on that final five minutes (I was doing an
emergency rez for someone).

I don't mind actually running out of time, but I do mind
being given an actual time and then having them jump the
gun on us.
