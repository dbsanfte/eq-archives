Who gives a flying fuck at a running squirrel's ass?

I wish that *everyone* who ran an EQ information site could do so at a
profit. I guarantee you that those who do make less than minimum wage
for the number of hours they put in.

Here's a suggestion: Take your opinion, write it on sandpaper, fold it
rough side out, and shove it as far up your ass as it will go. That
way, you'll have to think twice before shitting on people with more
worth than yourself.
