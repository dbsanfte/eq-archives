Kill Giants and Drakkal Dire Wolves.  The Drakkal Dire Wolves seem to be
primarily in Great Divide, while you'll find Frost Giants in Iceclad, Eastern
Wastes, Great Divide and Kael Drakkar that would be decent prey in
your level range in a good group.

Thurgadin, Kael Drakkar, and Skyshrine are the principle towns, there
is a small town, complete with bank, down in the bottom of Crystal Caverns
as well.  It doesn't seem to be possible to raise faction with the latter.

Thurgadin is on Coldain (dwarves) faction, Skyshrine is on Claws
of Veeshan  (dragons) faction.  Kael Drakkar is on giants factions,
Kromiff and so forth, there are three in there and I forget the names.
At any rate, killing giants and Drakkal wolves will raise your faction
with both coldain and COV, while getting you ever deeper into KOS
in KD.

Sorry, don't know the tower particularly, only been a few times.  I know
that it gets higher in level as you go up, you need a key for each level,
so hunting there while young enough to get exp in the lower levels
would be a nice investment in your future.

Fourth floor?
