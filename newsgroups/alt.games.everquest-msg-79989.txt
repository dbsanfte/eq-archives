I did too.  Some n00b Ogre was looking for a specific NPC one night as I was
finishing up the Oggok portion of the stein quest.  Being the helpful sort I
am and having the NPC in question on track at the time, I figured I'd go run
him down and give the n00b the loc.

Wandered into the Shaman guild and was promptly jumped by 3 Shaman ogres who
each got about a 300pt whack in on me.  Dead druid.
