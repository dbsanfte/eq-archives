I would like to apply a new ui skin (I am using default now) that shows
percent of level completed (or remaining).
I am a busy boy and cannot afford the time to experiment with several to
find out which ones are good and dependable.

Would anyone care to share the name of their favorites with me?  (include
web source if you have it, but I am sure I can find it if you don't)
