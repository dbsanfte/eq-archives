Hmm.  That wasn't my experience when leveling with it.  I spent a lot of
time in the grassy area of North Ro killing spiderlings for silks and
skellys for bone chips.  When skellies became scarce I would cast Sense The
Dead, at low skill I don't recall being able to sense the undead ruins in
the middle of the desert (I would get the message "No undead in zone" or
whatever).
