Most, if not all, books are safe to use for anyone.  They plop you down 
in a relatively safe spot.  After that, it depends on where you are 
heading.  The most unsafe one that comes to mind is Halas, as you cannot 
get to anywhere outside the newbie area without going by barbarian 
guards.  The FV book can be bad too, as there are wandering guards in the 
tunnels, they just don't wander up to the book.
