I was considering getting a cheap horse for my druid to get
the mana regen, so I camped Befallen for the one-shot bridle
to try it out.  I found out a lot of things I hadn't expected.

First, someone had posted that the one-shot horse was Jboots
speed.  Maybe that's true for the horse you get if you turn in
the bridle in Freeport and get a one-shot-whenever-you-want
bridle, but I decided to just click on the no-rent bridle
itself, and the horse I got was at most 3-4% over unbuffed
running speed, if that.

They seem to have fixed the issue with the horse's head getting
in the way; it wasn't in my view at all unless I angled my view
downward.

The new buff timers turned up the fact that the summoned horse
is good for "only" 6 hours.  Is that the case for other horses
also?  If so, is it affected by enhancement-extension focus
items?  Not that 6 hours isn't normally plenty, of course, but
with the one-shot bridle it's potentially more of an issue.

I knew I wouldn't be able to interrupt spells except by moving.
Even the new shift-S command doesn't do it.  (It does produce a
message saying you can't interrupt a spell while mounted.)  But
I was shocked at how many OTHER things you can't do while mounted.
Apparently you cannot Forage, Hide, Sneak, or Bind Wounds.  Not
being able to Forage is awkward, since a lot of druid quests
involve foraging (and I even recently quested for an item that
adds 10% to foraging skill).  But the inability to Bind Wounds
could literally be fatal.  Since I couldn't resummon this horse
if I dismissed it, I was stuck unable to get sitting regen (since
sitting on the horse doesn't count), unable to bind wounds, and
that meant burning mana on heals.  Toss in the fact that you
don't get the sitting mana regen while moving (not surprising),
and it ended up frankly feeling like more of a handicap than a
benefit.  (Especially since, for some reason, mammoths insisted
on stepping up until they were literally on top of me, and then
I couldn't melee them unless I moved, but then they'd move again,
etc., so I wasn't even getting sitting mana regen during melee.)
Root-rotting worked okay, but the lack of SOW hurt there.

After nearly dying once when oom (luckily my Crucible of Escape
didn't get interrupted), I clicked off the horse and went back
to old-fashioned medding.  I guess it might quite so bad if I
could click off the horse to bind wounds and get sitting HP regen,
then summon a new horse, but wow, being stuck on a one-shot horse
just felt really awkward.  Am I missing something?
