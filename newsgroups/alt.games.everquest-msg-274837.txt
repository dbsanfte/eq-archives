I don't know if it's still true, but it used to be that the targetting
and pathing in SRo adventures was horrendous.  Fortunately I was never
the puller, so I could just assist or use the "next npc" key, but as I
recall using your mouse to click on a mob just didn't work.  You could
have a mob right next to you, filling your screen, and still not be
able to click on it.

Once you got used to it, the zones weren't bad, and it was actually
really good training in using the keyboard rather than the mouse to
target, but it's a royal pain when you aren't used to it.

The pathing also tended to generate adds when you weren't expecting
it.  I had a chanter so we generally didn't have much trouble but it
certainly did keep me awake.
