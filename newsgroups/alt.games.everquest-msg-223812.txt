387.00 dollars to move 3 characters to a new account and server? A few 
database entries (probably largely automated) costs more than the 
monthly payment on my car (used 911).

That ain't right. Maybe it should have been possible to move servers (at 
least between some of them) all along... but transfers should *never* be 
like this!! Look at the situations in other mmrpgs from other vendors, 
most have vastly more favourable transfer policies, not this blatant 
profiteering.
