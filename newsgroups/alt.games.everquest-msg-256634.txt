The excitement was palpable, but omg the game was a punishing temptress. I
remember your scenarios fondly (one of my favorite memories is the first
time I witnessed a group take down an SG in Oasis. Shortly after the spoils
were announced, Lockjaw came sprinting through and tore up a few behinds). I
also remember, however, the corpses all over Najena, Unrest and Cazic Thule
(when I first played CT was a hunting ground for L20's), and players who had
lost *levels* from dying. Those were heady days, I do remember that, it sure
was nice putting that Voodoo card to good use after the lame attempt at 3D
in I'76. And I'll never forget my adventure on foot from Qeynos to Freeport,
back when Highpass was considered Death. Yeah, those were exciting times, in
part because of the tension that was created from the fear of death. It hurt
so much, you screamed out loud when you died and cursed the game for its
harsh reality. I stuck around for a few months before returning to UO and
trading in one game's frustrations for another's.
