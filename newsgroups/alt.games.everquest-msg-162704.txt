First off, trials are limited to 1 group.

You have to hail the tribunal and he ports
your group in, no one else can try a trial
while there's anyone in there.

Trial of execution runs like this - there's
the executioner and 4 waves of 4 beasties
that pop.  As soon as a wave of 4 pops, the
executioner starts walking to the victime,
if he gets there and kills him (30 seconds)
you lose.  If you kill one of the mobs from
the wave, he starts over (new shot clock, so
to speak).

There's a short (10second? 20?) pause between
waves.  After killing all 4 waves without the
condemned being executed, a boss mob shows up,
you kill him.

Because there's almost always multiple mobs in
the room, you can't sit to med, so nukers have
to watch their mana consumption, in order to make
it all 4 waves.

If you kill the boss, you loot something that
is needed to get flagged to go to PoV (and PoS?)

As an example of how much mana you can consume
in one of these.

I'm 61, had 234int and +325 mana from items.
let's see which is (with the 250 from KEI)
3327.  In addition I went in with a mod rod 
- took a shot early, took a shot at the 
beginning of 4th wave (5 min apart) - so 
add 720 more mana - 4047

I also have a horse (med almost constantly 
without sitting that way) and KEI on for 35
mana a tick regen (350 mana per minute).
From beginning to the end was over 5 min, so
call it 5.  5x350 = 1750

I used 5800mana (approx) in that 5 minutes, and
did around 22-24k damage, and still ran dry :(  Next
time I'm looking around for PotG (better, the
PoP upgrade to it) and Spiritual Purity (better
Spiritual Dominion) the 2 lower ones would add
13 per tick more regen, or 650 (5min) more mana
to play with in there. 2 more Shocks of Fiery
blades might have carried the day.
