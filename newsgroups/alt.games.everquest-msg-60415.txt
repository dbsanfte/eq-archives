My cleric dark elf level 34 with jboots and about 10 invis potions ran
from thurg through kael through wakening lands into skyshrine, got a
spare key from someone doing the whisper wing guy and then ran out
invis (all this while very kos to giants and dragons) and picked up
the fang at the ring, ran back inside then gated.

If she can do that a druid of 47 certainly can all alone ;) Stuff like
that is "druid easy."

No, don't wolf form the speed diff from SOW is not worth it and you'll
have to resow at possibly a bad time. Invis on the outside and sow
before entering kael, enter and be ready to invis again if have to.
have a map of the route to get through where the creatures don't see
invis (basically the straightest most direct route through)

Once in WL, be very careful if still kos to dragons. What I did on my
cleric was go to the right along the wall sort of.... then moving out
from it when approaching some giants in a group (their leader sees
invis I guess) Now there is also a quest dragon or something who is
white near that wall.. give it a wide berth. Keep going around and you
come to skyshrine eventually. Another option is just going right
through the middle (any of these while invised of course) dodging
priests or the like who might be Up (never remember if those see
invis.. I never get close enough to find out ;)  )

The other option is come out of kael and head along the left wall..
and give the area that dips down to the Woushi druid ring a  WIDE WIDE
berth (if kos) instead continuing more westerly. This might even be a
bit safter way to go now.

Once in skyshrine at 47 if you don't have the key yet you can probably
solo whisperwing easily (get a map of skyshrine if don't have. Easiest
way to do it without getting the others is:

( whisperwing room) (-----next room with emil--)
-----------hall------- YOU

go to the end of that hall sort of where you can still see whisper,
get at max pull distance and you could even cast harmony on him (this
area is outdoors, FYI) just to be safe, then start a nuking. He'll
merrily come to you and die pretty fast, get the ring and reinvis, run
to fountain, use, run outside invis go to ring get fang gate.
