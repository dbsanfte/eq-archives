But I've read here and there that there will be an EQ2 and that Verant is
currently working on an EQ2.  I guess I'm more wondering what will be in EQ2
that will warrant it being called that when none of these expansions have
warranted such a title.  Then again, is Verant working on an EQ2 or even
thinking about making an EQ2?  Perhaps Verant isn't thinking of making one
thus all there will ever be will be expansions.
