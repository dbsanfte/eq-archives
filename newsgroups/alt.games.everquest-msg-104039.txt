Someone managed to convince Allakhazam that there was a lore version,
and he put it in the site. This is where most people get that a lore
version exists, or where they point for evidence (so they don't have
to put up when challenged to show the lore version they supposedly
have on an alt). However, yesterday, Alla updated the site and removed
to lore flag from the item description. Guess all the scammers will
have to find a new game...
