Yep I had a PB 486 DX 2 66. 4 mg ram onboard. That computer even survived an
electrical storm. My friends all told me that I bought a piece of crap but,
it now sits in my youngest childs room with 36 mg ram a matrox video card an
is great for surfing the web or playing childrens games or for book reports.
I also upgraded the hard drive (it came with a 420 mg HD). It also run Win
98.
