It doesn't work best when damage is focussed, though.  It works best when there's
lots and lots of damage that occurs at a predictable rate.  Can happen slowly, can
happen fast, can happen to one person or be spread out over several people.  The key
is that your target should have few HP left and recieve lots and lots of HP back, and
that he isn't in any danger of dying before the heal lands.  Oh, and that noone else
is in danger of landing before the heal goes off and you can get their's to them.

This situation happens most often with a single MA.  But imagine 2 MA with equal HP
and AC and mitigation/avoidance.  One gets down to as low as he can and still have
the second taunt off him.  Now the cleric CHeals MA one while MA two sponges up the
damage... and when he gets down to his low spot, swap again with that CHeal still
coming.  This might actually be preferable to single MA if you can pull it off, now
you'd be using every bit of the CHeal you can, yet never risking MA death due to a
"too slow" cast.
