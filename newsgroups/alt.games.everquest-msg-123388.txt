Isn't one of the NPCs from the Qeynos tax collection quest in that house,
too?  If so, this would also break that quest.

Unless the new line-of-sight rules have changed this, as a workaround, you
could try getting someone to cast a PB AOE spell right outside the house,
and see if the NPCs will come out to kill that person.  After they are done
with that person (either by killing him, or because he zones), you could try
hailing the NPC to stop them from going back home, and complete the quest.
