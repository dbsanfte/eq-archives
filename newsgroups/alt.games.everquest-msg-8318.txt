Actually, my 38 druid has three different looks now. Regular leather
(foreman's tunic/gatorscale leggins, gingerbread (cured tizmak
surcoat/tizmak leggings), and black (gnome skin tunic/leggings).
I wear gnomeskin boots for the look until I get GE boots (I had
patchwork boots before that, they're in my bank instead of on my feet
as a lucky charm now) and gnomeskin gloves/visible chipped bone bracer
for a black sleeved glove look.

Someone let me try on a wicker tunic the week after the Warrens
opened. I didn't like it too much, on my female wood elf it looks like
a green chiffon drape pulled over my regular leather. Looked better on
the male wood elf I borrowed it from.
