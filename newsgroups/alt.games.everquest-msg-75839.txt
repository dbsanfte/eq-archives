Exactly.  I'm aware of what trolling is; but, being raised in Arizona,
haven't done much of it, and am not a big follower of fishing.  There's no
reason to expect others to know the specifics of your job.  If I were to
make a reference to Hymann Rickover, I would not expect many to know who he
was, even though he was one of the major forces behind our nucler power
industry.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
