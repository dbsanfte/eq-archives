Well, MSN is a news page, and they didnt really give 9/11 any more coverage
than theyd give Valentine's day. I was talking about microsoft.com. But I
suppose parent companies dont count hey? Cuz sony.com has a blurb about
it...

And I respect your opinion also. I dont respect being told that I should be
pissed about things, whatever they are. Too many bad things happen that way,
like 9/11...
