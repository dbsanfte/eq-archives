nVIDIA RIVA TNT2 m64 AGP

Why did you bother buying such an antique?  when you could have bought
for under 100 bucks a geforce-2 mx-400(minimal, dont buy the 200).  or
even gone to someplace like www.newegg.com and picked up the good deal
on the visiontek geforce-2 GTS-v oem card for 70 delivered.  (
excellent performance for anyone playing at 1280x1024 and below).

the card you bought doesnt even match the TNT2 cards that were sold a
couple of years ago in performance, if you could find one of the old
32 meg cards for 20-30 bucks it might fill in.

Just really irritated at the companies that keep flooding the market
with these crappy cards.
