Oh, c'mon.  It isn't even close to being the same thing.

You're welcome!  :-p
Since it takes nothing more than a bit of patience to determine
whether or not a trade is "fair", I think you're venom is way out
of line.  Hell, I've missed a number of good deals taking too long
to figure out whether a deal is fair or not.  And I see far slimier
pricing scams going on in the bazaar than in the old system.

True.  :)

Now that we've disposed of this issue (doubt we'll ever agree),
I feel that I simply must point out your failure to properly
discharge your duties as the "Deputy Inspector General of A.G.E.,
Arrow Sig Division".  You still haven't rendered judgement on the
new sig of Khosh (aka Valien) as was explicitly requested in
Annie's "Jerk" thread yesterday.

Kaev <--- My doctor says it's just a phase I'm going thru  :-p
