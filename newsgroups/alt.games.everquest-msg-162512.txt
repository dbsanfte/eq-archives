Not that I think it's likely to happen, since it obviously opens up the
door to too much rampant abuse and/or unbalancing of the class, but I'll
say that from an in game "logical" perspective, I agree with you 100%.
That would be a good thing for necros and would make sense. Sadly, it
would probably be *too* good of a thing, so it won't happen.
