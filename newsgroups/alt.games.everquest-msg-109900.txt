If by Rathe Mtns, you mean giants... well a 24 druid would get SLAUGHTERED
there esp. without good wis gear.  To make money safely at yer lvl:

Frontier Mtns (group all the way)
Netherian Lair (group all the way)
Puladal Caverns (can do some decent solo work)
Unrest (Wolf-form and solo to yer hearts content)
Bandits in EK (Watch out for the casters - not much exp but okay loot)
Runnyeye (need a couple of melee with ya in there at 24)
Shadeweavers Thicket (closer to the newb side .. but not too close)
Lake of Ill Omen (slow but steady loot and not a whole helluva lot of risk
at 24)
HHP (Good luck getting a group "on demand")
Field of Bone (Don't leave the pit, work the Heartstrings and wipe out
skellies in Kurns- again slow. but steady with a few plat here and there)

Each of the zones has some pluses and minuses... by way of example... in FoB
you'll fill backpacks with skeleton chips, good to auction off in places
where bones are less abundant, same with Unrest, except in Unrest you'll get
some bronze drops and FS which are good to sell)

I lost a corpse around lvl 19 (was an ignorant druid) in Lfay a long time
ago, and by working Unrest I was able to get enough money to start replacing
my gear in a couple of nights playing (and grabbed about 4 levels)

Good luck to ya!
