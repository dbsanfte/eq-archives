(Share your stories, too.)

So, there I was, in North Karanas, hunting my little level 10 Ranger as
a change of pace.  I hear some /anon guy named after a South Park
character asking for a guide from the Gypsy Camp to Splitpaw; people
shout, "Just go south," but to no avail.  He offers 10 plat for a guide,
20, 30...  At 30 plat, I finally give in and let him know I'll guide
him.  I get there and tell him to follow close, etc., and con him--he's
*green.*

Okay, I figure, he's just been exploring.

We make the trip without incident, and along the way, I chat with him
some.  I find out he's level three--and had been FIGHTING at the
spires.  You heard me--grouped and fighting.  "I've got a level 40
Shaman," he says.  I assume he means he was grouped with himself.  He
was--but also with others, who I'm sure were wondering why he fell with
just one hit from a gnoll.

I figured, well, his funeral.  I did advise him that he wouldn't get any
experience doing that, he was far too low, and if he was trying to
powerlevel he'd be better off staying ungrouped and doing gnolls with
the Shaman healing him.  He said "thx," paid me, and I was on my way
back to NK.

I hadn't been in NK five seconds when I hear him shouting, "Paying for a
guide to Splitpaw."

Good lord.

I guided him there again, and after we got into SK, he got lost.  He
didn't TELL me he'd lost me, he just did, and proceeded to run around
until I realized he was no longer behind me and asked where he was.
Duh.  We finally met back up at the bridge, at which time he said he had
to go, but his brother was going to take over the character so he could
loot up.

As we were on our way--with his brother sticking much closer--said
brother t'd me, "My bro says not to pay you.  But that's not right, so I
will, I promise."  Good thing, too, or he would've found himself alone
in the rainy plains of SK.  (While 30pp for guiding him twice is still
worth it, being lied to is not.)  I got bro there, he looted, he paid
me, first guy came back.  I told him, "Get out of here.  Go to
Blackburrow, you'll just keep dying here."

I made 87pp off of him that night.
