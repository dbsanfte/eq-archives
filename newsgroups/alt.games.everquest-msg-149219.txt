Brass is very easy to max out, just like any other song, you find
a nice safe spot with no wandering bad guys, equip instrument,
start song, go to bed.  Next day, when you get up in the morning,
go on about your business, skill maxed out.

Brass is the hardest to max, of course, since you must play an AOE
damage song, which means you need not just a spot with no wandering
bad guys, but one free of wandering good guys as well.  Still ridiculously
simple compared to what any other caster must do to max out their less
used casting skills.
