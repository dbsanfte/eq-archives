I don't have two accounts but I use two computers (both Win2K with
Internet connection sharing) over a 56k line while playing EQ. The
second 'puter is used for price checks, NGs, emailing, eqatlas
consultations etc so it is not as intensive as an EQ connection.  I
still notice a bit of lag on the EQ machine (the one the modem is
attached to) when I load a large(ish) page or file.  I'd say you might
run into lag problems running two full blown EQ connections over one
56K connections but cannot confirm it for sure.  I am also playing
from Ireland which is about 6000 miles and a zillion routers from the
servers so that probably doesnt help me.  YMMV if you are closer to
the servers in California.
