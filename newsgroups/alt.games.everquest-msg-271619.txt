I play D2 to relax... :)

OK. But then I do highly recommend playing at least to the midgame, 
there is a lot of interesting stuff to do. But the first 20 levels are 
pretty lacking. ...

Speaking of which have you done your newbie armor quests. Very good 
armor, and a magic weapon besides. Plus they are soloable, at least the 
one's Ive done have been. And the gear, while not great, will last you 
into your 20s and beyond. (Although its junk by modern standards, its 
very very good compared to what you could get at those levels 
otherwise.)

Not compared to a damage class. Warriors are mediocre at damage. You 
only have to look to your beastlord for a lesson in dps... when you turn 
9th and get your pet at least.

Once you hit your 20s/30s it will be much easier. It takes longer to 
level at that point, and your weapon skills will catch up, provide you 
use them.

I recommend switching to weaker weapon skills, once you know the fight 
is won, or even once the mob is running.

When you go to a car wash by donation with no suggested minimum do you 
really think a donation of a nickel is appropriate? Of course not!

A simple ooc in the pok or here in this ng... "Hi, what is the average 
donation one pays for temperance, what is considered generous? what is 
considered an insult?"

But instead you handed over your nickle, and then were peeved that you 
were scoffed at. If you honestly don't know what the donation should be, 
you should take the initiative to find out.

Except that it gradually stops working. Right now you can usually take 
mobs that con blue, that means they are around your level, but a bit 
lower. You can use web sites to find blue mobs a couple levels lower 
than you, as you've been doing, and it works ok.

Eventually this doesn't really help... even the blue mobs will be able 
to take you. The places you can go to find blue mobs that you can 
prevail against, that don't run, that don't self heal, that aren't 
surrounded by friends, etc, becomes very small.

is only exceeded by the embarrassment of hitting a hotkey that isn't 
actually doing anything useful at all, even when it *is* mapped to 
something??

:p
