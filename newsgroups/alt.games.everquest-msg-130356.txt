Yes, tho 29 isn't too lo for the cleric, you want your tank to be at
least mid-thirties for a duo.  At 34 or so Lenny should be able to dish
it and take it well enough to kill an HG with a healer partner.  If you
want to do it lower get a couple more people (druid is pretty handy for
a low-end HG group:  DS, DoT, extra heals, and SoW for everybody in
case of overpull or train, too bad my druid is too low :( ).

If you're not set on the HG platinum farm, but just looking to watch
that big timber fall, you two should be able to take down Hillocks (and
maybe Tumps) in FM without too much trouble.  And Lenny could have some
fun with a Weighted Axe once you've looted one.
