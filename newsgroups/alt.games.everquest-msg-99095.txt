Figures- 15 minutes after I poseted this, the HoF has changed- a lot. Last
week positions 1-8 and 10 were 8500s.
Not a very meaningful thing, anyhow- I just realized that they use a 1 Gig
CPU for the base system for the HoF- that CPU can't even begin to push ANY
of those cards to their potential. What a waste.
