OK, so I've played both games for over a year each.  AC is a lot less time
consuming as far as getting thing together for leveling and questing.  AC
hardly ever requires you to have to group with other people to level or
complete quests.  AC you really don't have classes like you do in EQ.
Everyone in AC has magic of some sort and can do everything another
character can do and train.  EQ I think has much better creature and
character design and creature AI.  AC has no zones to cross all one big
laggy world.  If I only have an hour or less to play I would probably jump
on AC, but if I have a few hours I'll play EQ.  For me when I accomplish
something in EQ it feels like I've really done something (probably because
accomplishments such as quest can be a pain in the arse to complete).  In AC
it like, OK so I did that what's next kind of attitude.  I'd say it would
really have to do with how much time you have to play.  In the first 10 to
15 levels depending on what class you play, EQ goes along quite fast and
doesn't always take hours to accomplish something or get a level, but after
that you're putting lots of time in to the game.  AC you can always log on
for a half hour raise a few skills and be done for the day or go hunting for
a hour and log.  I like both games for different reasons.  Word of warning
both can be very addictive!
