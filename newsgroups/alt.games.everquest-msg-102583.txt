No kidding.

Is anybody ELSE sick of dumbass parents blaming everything else for their
child's own stupidity?
I sure am...
I'll rest assured tonight that if my daughter is arrested for stealing a car
and going on a joyride, I'll know it must be my own shitty parenting that
led her to do something dumb, not Metallica's "Don't Tread On Me" she was
listening to while in the car.

*rolls eyes*

f'ckin idiots.
