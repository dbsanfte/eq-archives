I did the same and everything was as I'd left it.

BUT in the mean time EQ had moved on.  I only had the base EQ + Kunark
(there wasn't anything else when I left) when I came back Luclin and
Vellious had been added.

So even though my kit was the same it was now soooo old by comparison
with everyone else!  My level 18 monk had been punching mobs in
Befallen ("Weapons?  No I'm a monk I don't need weapons!") and was
wearing a complete set of glorius raw silk.

He now looks back at his younger self and can't imagine how he
survived !

Cheers

52nd Monk, Luclin
