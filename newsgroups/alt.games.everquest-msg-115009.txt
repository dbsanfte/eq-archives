I just wonder how many other wood elves that are non-druid get asked for
sows? Am I the only one? I think it is kinda odd me being a warrior wearing
crafted greaves, crafted bp, crafted gauntlet, and dual wielding and still
people will every now and again come up "Can I have a sow?". It is funny...
I am nice and all about it, kinda cool to get to feel how druids do at
times. "Can I get a sow?" "Sure thing, ask a druid."

(Sorry kinda getting into a rant...)
