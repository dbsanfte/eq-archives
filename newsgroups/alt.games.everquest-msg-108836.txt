But one thing people have always argued for is to be able to do something
that will actually effect the game/world, this is the only one off event in
the game.
I can understand why people wouldn't want it to happen althought it doesn't
really bother me, Fu woke him ages ago on Bristlebane and even if they
hadn't I would never be going there :ï¿½)
This would not stop me from going to Stormhammer as I don't ever expect to
reach that level of the game, to start with I'd have to make an effort and
there is little effort in my EQ playing.
