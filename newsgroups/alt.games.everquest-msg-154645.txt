The other response to this post answered everything
very well, except for the "why" there are different
servers (if you're interested).

Other than the few servers which have "special rules",
the majority of the Everquest world servers are
exactly the same as each other (except for different
player populations, of course).

The reason there are a few dozen independent servers
is to prevent massive overcrowding.  Imagine if all
400,000+ players were in the same "world" -- for every
shop in town, for every good place to hunt monsters,
there would be hundreds and hundreds of players
crowding each other, fighting over the limited
space and resources.

So instead there are a lot of "cloned" worlds,
separate from each other, and as a result there
are a reasonable number of people "living" in each
one.

Having a sane number of people on each server
also enhances the "community" feel, because like
living in a moderately sized town in real life,
you find yourself running into a lot of the same
folks frequently.  If everyone who played EQ
ran on the same server, there would be so many
people it would be like living in Chicago -- every
person you ran into would be a new face, a stranger,
and only very rarely bumping into old friends as
you traveled around.
