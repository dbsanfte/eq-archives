That's just rubbish - everyone can hunt in every zone if they can deal with
the mobs and CS is just paradise when you have allied CoV faction.
But most quad kiters seem to have no idea that the mobs WILL help each
other, IF you get close enough to others. And that's the case when
you pull a train of 4 right over someone elses pet.

Last day I got trained 6 times(!!!) within maybe 10 hours, and those where
just the trains I didn't notice in time cause the others I would evade.

All I ask for is that people lead their quad pack around others at a certain
distance. And in this special case it was an intentional train anyways.
