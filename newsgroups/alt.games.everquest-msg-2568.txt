The ability to wear chain armors, and fighting skills (and I guess tracking
at lvl 1) in no way make up for the inferior spells of the ranger imo.
Druid is arguably got the best choice of spells in the game.
Post 50's you will find that you arnt wanted in groups so much. Your spells
just dont cut it against the other specialized classes, though you can still
solo easily.
Then again, rangers arnt in high demand post 50 (or pre 50 either)
