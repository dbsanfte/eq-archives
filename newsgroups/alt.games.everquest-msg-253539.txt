The front page at www.legacyofsteel.net has some interesting thoughts on the
current state of the game and what is wrong and right with it.  Seanlan's
comments in particular seem well thought out and accurate.  (Warning: not
safe to read while drinking, if you value your keyboard.  I nearly spewed my
soda at this line: "A month or two later, guilds could come back with
thurgadin quest armor, or primal weapons, or the entire population of
taiwan, and try again").
