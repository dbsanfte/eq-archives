But why does 'some effort' need to be 'mind numbingly boring 
RSD-inducing tedium'??

It doesn't... I've said several times now that I'm not looking for it to 
be easy, just fun.  Dieing on a raid may not be 'fun', but that's a 
*risk* you take, and not dying makes the reward sweeter...but 
tradeskilling has no risk... the tedium of it is inevitable and 
unavoidable... good groups and the right tactics don't count for shit in 
tradeskills...your destiny hinges entirely on your ability to stand CTS 
pain while you wait for the RNG to ring in your 250 skill ups.
