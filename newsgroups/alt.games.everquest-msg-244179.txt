They're probably getting filtered if y our news server blocks binaries in
non-binary groups.   The spam he's referring to has a random porn name, and
a file attached.   Reguardless of the name of the current message, the file
is always the same size, and is in .scr format.   So, basicly, a virus or
trojan.

The postings appear to have started around 4/11/04.   In the 5 days since
then a 50kb program has been posted 7 times and a 76kb program has been
posted 8 times.
