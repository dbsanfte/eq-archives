Could someone please give me some suggestions for a good log parser? I
have been using YALP up to now, but I don't like the changes made in
version 2.4. I have been copying the log files to a different name to
minimize the file sizes while in EQ, but recently there must have also
been a change to how some skill up and level changes are shown in the
logs as YALP 2.3 no longer seems to read these in the newer logs.
