It's a game like dodgeball is a game.

All fun and games until somebody gets hurt.

But seriously...

The difference is typically we're used to playing games in short bursts
with people. Unless your a P&P D&D player or really into Risk. But even
then you're with a small group of people for long stretches.

MMORPGs build entire communities that exist within our own real world(tm).
How people act and react in there can and do directly affect our personal
lives. Is it a game? Yes it is ... But it's a game that we've all
devoted a fair amount of our real lives to. It's REAL to us in the sense
that we get hurt when someone is mad at us, we get angry when we die
because of a stupid idiot training us or not listening to the raid leader.

We go and spend DAYS and WEEKS on quests, camping that elusive spawn just
so we can say we've accomplished it. It's a personal best to say "I sat
through and completed my epic."

Some people don't see it that way, however, and say "It's just a game so
whataver I do really has no consequence."

And to them, I say STFU and get out of my face. This isn't QuakeIII or
CS or UT:2K3 .. go back to pulling the wings off of flies and watching
ants burn with a magnifying glass.
