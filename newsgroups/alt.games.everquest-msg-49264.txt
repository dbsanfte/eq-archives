The FBI (Freeport Bureau of Invesetigation) needs YOUR help in
apprehending some of the most Wanted monsters of our time!

What monster in EQ do you think qualifies as Norrath's Most Wanted? As
in the one that people most want dead, for any reason at all.

I limit this to regular mobs of lesser strength than Lodizal to
eliminate the ubermobs.

Doesn't matter what level or how good its loot is in an absolute
sense, its just the one people at the proper level were most keen to
kill.

A few examples:

Ambassador D'Vinn, Crushbone: The scurge of the tower trains made life
miserable for anyone hunting near the zone for many weeks after EQ was
first released, and the chance at a dragoon dirk had everyone
drooling. The only problem is: his attack numbers are so high he
almost constantly maxes his damage (at typical CB levels) making him
miserable to tank....

Kizdean Gix, West Commons: Though he doesn't actually move around a
whole lot, when he is wandering about he's a menace. His shadowknight
dot/slow has caught many a sowed individual completely by surprise....
He has to be the target of more "payback" kills than any other dark
elf in Norrath....

Bouncer Hurd, Feerrott: Besides being an absolute nightmare for people
recovering from the virtually non-stop trains of Cazic before it
became a ghost temple (stupid Ill Omen), he also had the distinction
of dropping a very nice item for enchanters as a common drop.

Reclusive Ghoul Magus, Unrest: Often the very first "named" monster
people try in Faydwer. It was always exciting two and a half years ago
when the puller called the rgm incoming. I'll always think of him as
the reclusive ghoul magi no matter how incorrect grammatically it is!

Gynor Moltok (or was it Gynox?), Befallen: The Paw of Oppala was and
is still considered a very valuable item. It's a lot easier to get
now. Pity the poor fools who almost *had* to camp this guy in a
deadbeat dungeon, with a roaming placeholder of a useless mob that
would take off as soon as it spawns. I don't care HOW good the Paw is,
I never even considered doing it if it meant camping this guy. But on
the other hand, when he appeared....

And many, many others, which hopefully people will mention (like the
GBS dropper near Qeynos who's name escapes me atm)....

But in terms of the history of EQ, I think there can really be only
one famous choice, so here's mine....

Bilge Farfathom, Dagnor's Cauldron. In terms of rarity and
desirability of both of his drops (PKT and reed belt), I think his
fame, especially before Kunark, as the most wanted Mob in Norrath is
well deserved.
