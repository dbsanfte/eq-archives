I'm not trying to bash Bards, but over the course of a week I saw 3
different Bards train Specs to the docks. They would run up and stand
there until the specs arrived, then bellow (or some other damaging
song as seen in the text buffer) and run off. When I nuked the Specs,
in all three instances, the idiots shouted out that they were KS'd.
Maybe it was just a bad week :-). I have also watched purely evil
Druids train SGs and Specs repeatedly down the Orc highway when I was
much lower in level. Needless to say the lowbies (myself included at
the time) took it in the shorts. That is one of the reasons I like to
hang out in Oasis and protect the lowbies. That zone seems to attrack
more jerks than any other. Most likely due to the 35+ Mobs in a zone
more suited for 15-22.

So far I have gotten the exp for root/dotting Slate each time it has
happened to me. I am sure you are right though, because I am very
familiar with the "Run up and /yell" technique of getting free exp
from higher level characters on <50%HP mobs. I'll help them once. The
next time I am "afk" when they come by :-P

Cheers
