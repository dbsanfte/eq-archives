    The argument is valid because it is logical and true. He wants the name,
the rule itself doesn't prevent him from creating a character with that
name, so therefore he uses that name. The argument is wrong because it is
morally wrong to break a ruleset that one must consent to every time one
chooses to play EQ. None of this changes the fact that people who want to
create names that may or may not (depending on the mood and knowledge base
of the GM responding to the petition) break the naming rule will do so
regardless of whether it is moral or not. Just like people named Dark Tyger
that choose to speed "because they want to", regardless of whether it is
moral or not.
