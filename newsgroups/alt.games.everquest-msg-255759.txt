...you guys do know that there are some pretty good reasons to want to
know this dont you?  For one, he may not want his computer-savvy kid
finding it.  For another, he may have lost it in the past and is
looking for a quick way to retrieve it in the future.  I remember when
playing counterstrike, I often had to find my old CD-key (after losing
the CD) when I needed to reinstall.  I had the key handy though,
because I found a way to get it out of the registry.  This could be a
similar situation...

In any case, if he wanted to steal a friend's PW (or for any player
whose computer he has access to), it probably wouldn't be very hard. 
There are lots of ways, from installing a sniffer to finding his
friend's email open.
