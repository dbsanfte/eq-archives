Go read a few volumes of "Meatmen" (it's an excellent anthology of gay
comix) and then look at a human bard.  The human bard fits right in there,
at least with some of the face models.  There's one face in particular that
is straight (no pun intended) out of gay comix.

Of course, if they wanted gay inspiration...they should have modeled humans
after Tom of Finland's artwork.  I'd play a human if I could use those
models.
