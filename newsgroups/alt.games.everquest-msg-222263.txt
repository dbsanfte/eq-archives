Well, you can't do a comprehensive search of their quests by class,
for example...you have to browse them by zone, basically, is the best
way I've found.  And I do remember seeing some 10th level quests for
Blackburrow, getting Ale Casks or something.  The reward was pretty
weak, so I ignored it.  I will look closer.  And yeah, I can't wait to
do the Ivy-etched armor quests, but I need to be in my 20's to have a
chance of surviving them I think.

I actually did walk from Freeport to Qeynos recently, which was an
adventure...I'd just got Cameoflage, and didn't realize that its
duration was almost random.  I was halfway through High Hold Pass when
it expired without me noticing, but fortunately the red-con gnoll that
chased me switched its aggro to one of those citizens.  The recast of
the spell got me all the way to Western Karana!  And by the way, I do
have the PoP expansion, I just wanted to walk to see the sights.  I
didn't bother with the ship from Faydwer though, that would be going
overboard. ;)

Also, I didn't realize that starting a new topic with the same name as
one from 4 years ago would merge those topics on Google...I always
wondered when I saw someone continuing a thread that was so old how
they had the patience to search through the archives to find it.  Now
I know!  Those of you who have newsreaders probably have no idea what
I am talking about here.

Game on,

The Oneiromancer
