I'm sorry bizbee, I took what you said in your earlier post literally.  You
said that you would assume you can't dispel(sic) a buff or spell on one
(mob) either (in addition to being unable to heal or buff).  I just thought
that I would mention that is not correct.  Next time I will try harder to
know what you intended to say.  I keep trying to tell my wife that I can't
read minds, but she insists I try doing so on her as well.
