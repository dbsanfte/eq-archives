sometimes I wonder what the fucking point is to ignoring spammers in this
group. almost every one of them gets replied to, and then chains (little
more rare, but obviously happens) start like this one, and its like.. god
damn.. what was the point of ignoring it. I wish outlook wasnt such a gay
piece of shit and ignore thread would auto delete, but instead all it does
is mark it and everytime I view this group it goes RIGHT TO IT. but im too
lame to change news viewers:(



Oddly this is the only group I visit where people are so compelled to reply
to spammers instead of just kill filing them, a little hypocritical atm to
be bitching about something im currently doing, but I wanted to say
something, and didnt wanna start a new thread over it.


good day..
