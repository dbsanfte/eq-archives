I'm a level 18 monk and I can't beat most mid or high blues solo.
Sometimes I even have troubles with low blues solo.
I fight hand to hand.  All of my skills are maxed.
I only have cloth and netted armor.
I don't have much magic jewelry.  I have 100pp.
I like to vary between groups and soloing

Am I doing something wrong?  Is this a monk problem?
Are my expectations too high?
Will it help much if I beef up my armor and jewelry?
