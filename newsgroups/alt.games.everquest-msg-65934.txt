I don't know about changing the transparency, but you can move
the item window - this is from John Clancy's post in another
thread

Actually there is. But you have to manually go into your eqclient.ini
file and modify the position of the box by hand. What I do is move a window
that you can move to a position where you want the item info to eventually
go (like the target box)  then exit EQ and read the eqclient.ini file for 
the position
of that box, then change the item info box (x,y) position to that 
coordinates.

Look in the eqclient.ini file in the section for the resolution you play 
under.

For instance if you play in 800x600 resolution look for this section:

[Windows800]

Then under that section look for the window coordinates you want to
use. For example if you used the target window find:

TargetWinY=405
TargetWinX=322

Then find and change the item data window ones to those same coordinates:

ItemDataWinY=270
ItemDataWinX=465

to

ItemDataWinY=405
ItemDataWinX=322

Now run EQ and your item data will be where you had
placed your target window. Then just move your target window back to
where you like it and you are done!
