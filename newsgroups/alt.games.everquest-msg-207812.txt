I was fifteen or so, making my first trip to kunark. I fell off the
boat. I just knew I was gonna die in the ocean, and never get my
corpse back. I figured I was done with eq, I'm not gonna start over
now. Swam for almost two hours. Finally one of the smarter guildies
realizes I'm a cleric "gate out" he says. Of course I'm smart enough
to know you can't gate while swimming. "Stop swimming" he says.
And sink to the bottom and drown? Well might as well, I'm tired of
swimming anyway. Sure enough, I stop swimming, sink, mem gate and lo
and behold it casts. On my next try I fell off the boat again, but at
least this time I already had gate memmed :)
