Afternoon All,

After some years (4) of only playing a Paladin (56) and a Druid (55), I 
have decided that it is time to diversify.

So after some deliberation, and advice from friends that I/they need and 
Enchanter, I have decided to take the plunge

So can anyone advise me on the best starting stats and race.

It seems to me that there is 2 routes I could take

a. Boost the standard stats for an enchanter as best I can at character 
set up

OR
b. Boost non-standard stats, given that I can afford to twink the char 
to the value of 10k. This method would allow we to be more balanced at 
higher levels, as the +'s you get on class specific items seems to be 
biased towards the stats required by the class.

Thanks for any advice

TTFN
