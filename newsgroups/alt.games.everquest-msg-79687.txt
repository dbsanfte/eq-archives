The worst train i ever caused was in Kurns.
First one was when my monk managed to hit a skelly with Instill Doubt. A 
running skelly in Kurns pick up a LOT of mobs on the full 18 sec, 
especially when youre the only one in zone, so all mobs out. Didnt even 
stick around to see how many, ran after my ID ran out, and the horde 
came running down.

Saw a picture of a guildies train in Kurns, he was there to get bone 
chips, and made a train from level 4 and down when he left, got over 20 
skellys on him.
