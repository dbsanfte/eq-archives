Bah, if you're of high enough level to need to be in Velious, you should 
be able to safely port in.  If you're really worried, get a SoW from 
someone before you leave Luclin.  It's not like there aren't SoW casters 
waiting with you.  (I don't think I've ever seen a time when there wasn't 
at least one SoW caster in Nexes.)

Oh come on now.  If you're going to be porting to Velious, you're most 
likely mid-30s at least.  Port in, run east, safe zone line.  What's the 
big deal?

The trick to this is to not drop invis until the portal is about to fire.  
Wait until the Scion says that the portal is now active, drop invis, hail, 
say 'journey to luclin' and sit tight for another 10-15 seconds.  Nothing 
that paths through there should kill anyone level-appropriate in that 
amount of time.

I'm not saying that this is completely trivial, just that it isn't as hard 
as people keep saying.  Remember that Velious was designed for characters 
35+, and that any zone is going to be tough if you're at the very low end 
of the level-appropriate range.  I do remember that several folks here did 
run sub-level-5 characters all the way to Kael, so it can be done.
