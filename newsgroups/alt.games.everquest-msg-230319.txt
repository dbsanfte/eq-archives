For what it's worth, personally I can't stand overquoting.  Especially when 
you get to the point where it's reams and reams of disjointed message 
fragments with unruly quotation marks all over the place.

The only thing more annoying is the whining from people about 'selective 
cut-and-paste' when you're hammering them in an argument but they jump on 
the fact that you haven't quoted the full rant of theirs.

Oh, and Kinslayer?  Worth even less, I know, but if you answer like that 
you just look petulant.

It's my opinion, is all.
No, I'm not qualified.  No, I don't know everything.
No, I probably haven't got all the facts.
And yes, you probably *are* better than me.
Believe me, I can live with it.
