EQ could be improved as well to make it more friendly.

1. Better lighting. Surefall Glade & Hallas have tunnels which are
    practically impossible to navigate when naked or using that crappy
    newbie candle. Would a few torches on the walls of these tunnels
    hurt?
2. Better sense heading. Should be 10 or some marginally useful value to
    start with and more prominent in the UI, e.g. added by default to the
    Ability menu.
3. Better starting locations. Newbies should always start by their
    guilds.
4. Online help. EQ has a help button that has said "this help is
    obselete" for a long time now. A simple interactive help system could
    go there.
5. Faster spell memorisation. It needs to be faster, at least for
    the newbie spells because it takes too damned long for no apparant
    reason.

Aside from 4), most of these would be straightforward to implement.

Of course that doesn't stop someone giving a newbie a nice weapon, but 
it might avert a lot of frustration for beginners who start a game when 
no one is willing or available to help (e.g. in Neriak 3rd gate, 1000hrs 
GMT).
