There is no real way to tell. I'm not looking forward to playing all
of them because they will all likely suck ass. I'll probably try as
many betas as I can, out of boredom. 

The horizons beta was really awful, now I'm hearing the final is not
that much different. One of the bigger complaints is you run clear
across the landscape and encounter no creatures in many places.
It sounds like this is another one that was published about a year
before it was finished.

Its worthwhile switching games if you like the game. If you like it,
enough other people will also play it. I'm playing FFXI on the Odin
server, with plenty of other americans to play with whenever I get on.
I'm already a bit bored with the game, though. Its really fun, there
is not as much downtime as in EQ, yet its just really familiar. Its
the old "kill creatures in this area to get experience for long
periods of time until you move on to the next area" treadmill. In a
new game that is exciting for a bit, while things are new, then its
the same old thing again.

Maybe I'm just MMORPG'd out after four and a half years of Everquest,
while waiting for all this stuff that was supposed to be "better." For
example, I saw a post I made to this group in NOVEMBER 2001 it was
about blizzard making world of warcraft mmorpg. That is how long ago
their WOW website popped up with the first screenshots and such. So
two years and six months later, we might be in the beta. Its a bit
late for me.
