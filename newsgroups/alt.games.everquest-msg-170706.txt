NVidia makes the chip (or GPU as they are called). Many different
manufacturers make the video cards. (PNY, MSI, Asus, eVGA, etc).

The Gf4 MX line of cards are a rip-off. They are really nothing more
than glorified GF2 cards or crippled GF4 cards depending on how you
look at it. They will run EQ fine, but it is false advertising on
NVidia's part, leading customers to think they are getting a real GF4
when they are not.
