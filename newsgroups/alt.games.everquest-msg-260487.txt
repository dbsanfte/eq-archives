I switched to the 9800 Pro, and am quite happy with it in comparison to the 
various NVidias I have used.  The only issue I have seen in EQ is when 
switching back to full screen mode, the gamma gets dorked up, and I have to 
go into options, and slide the gamma up or down, then back to it's original 
position to fix it.  For the performance increase, it was well worth it for 
the cost.  The 6800 and the X800 are both far too expensive for the 
performance increase you get, as was the 9800XT.  The 9800 Pro is far 
superior to any NVidia prior to the 6800.
