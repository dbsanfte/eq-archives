    I've been reading this newsgroup since before Everquest went live and I
know a lot of you have been around nearly as long. How long have you guys
been playing EQ as of this December?
    For me, I started in February of 1999 when phase 4 of beta started. :)
That would make 2 years and 10 months. Wow...so, come this February, I'll
break 3 years.
