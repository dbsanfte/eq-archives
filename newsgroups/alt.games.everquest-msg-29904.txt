You will not evade me, "Annie M. Benson-Lennaman"

Probably, if they're all 20. Call it a bunch of brothers married to a
bunch of sisters or something.

One of his to one of yours. I don't think you should be chain marrying
or making him an EQ bigamist for the sake of what is essentially a
family surname :) Tealeef can take the name Benlen even without
getting married.

Never been to one, but here's my thoughts:

Minister of some sort, be it GM, cleric, paladin.
Get a hold of a skilled brewer, you'll want fine wine and good ale.
Also get hold of a skilled cook; at the very least, you'll want one
wedding cake. I'd also consider alternate dishes, both baked and
foraged. (Ice cream would have been wonderful...)
Fruit, berries, foraged nuts and sparkly waters, cookies shaped as the
race of the bride and groom, various steaks (My SK is fond of raw
meat, but that's not exactly wedding food :) )
Try to coordinate your armor as much as possible. If the bride can
wear a robe, I suggest gossimer; ry'gorr would look nice on any of
your non-robed classes (Maybe tizmak leathers for Teashot, since WE
ry'gorr is a little bland) No weapons allowed during the ceremony,
except for dwarves with axes. 

Not sure how EC tunnel is for a location. I presume it is not a
marketplace on Drinal :) I wouldn't hold a ceremony inside - a bit too
stuffy - but the tunnel entrance could be nice.

Oh, and yes, I would like to come if at all possible :)
