I bought it, and while I agree that it's not got the most useful
information, and even has some misinformation, it's cool to read the history
and lore of the areas.  Nice reading material for the can.  plus, it's
better than nothing when you're in game and can't/don't want to tab out to
EQAtlas.  You are correct though, not nearly as detailed as the web atlas.
