: will specify/expand on below:

My opinion is this, the first time you do this it is not an exploit.
Hell you play the game long enough you will see al sorts of pathing
wierdness. The second time you do it using the same tactic, it's
questionable, the nth time you do it you are exploiting.

What is a GM that is wandering by going to do? Well if it was me, and I
did not have anything better to do than watch a high teens character
shoot Minos, I watch you and if you repeatedly did the same thing over
and over to gain experience without risk, I'd convict you and send you 
to the hell of upside down sinners.

In terms of the subject of this thread. I am not rushing to judgement
here. It seems to me both sides acted questionably. Personally, I'd like
to see the complete logs of the guild chat to see how much they seemed
to be consciously "cheating". While I find the snippets posted by Verant
to be damaging, selective editing by the accuser is also tasteless. If
Conquest is innocent, let them post their logs, (unedited of course).
