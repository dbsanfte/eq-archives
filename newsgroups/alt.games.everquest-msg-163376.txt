Best:

Pet aggro changes. No more trains from wayward pets.
Elimination of hybrid penalties.
The Bazaar.
The Beastlord class, their mana/hp regen line that was added later,
and being amiable to most animals.
Beastlord epic upgrade.
Ports for everyone, both through the spires and PoK.
Soulbinders.

Worst:

Gauze press nerf
Post expansion nerfs of stuff they should have caught in beta.
Recent resist changes.
KEI. Not the spell itself, the ability to group cast on those far
below the level required for direct targeting.
Insanely expensive tradeskills.
Giving beastlords only ONE exclusive hand to hand weapon. The rest we
have to compete for with monks.
