It's fun to watch little kids in 3D computer games.  A long time ago at
work, we were doing some work on educational software, and for some reason
wanted to see how kids would handle a 3D computer world, so we had the
daughter of the boss, who was around 5 or 6 at the time (the daughter, not
the boss!), get into a Quake 2 deathmatch level and run around.  She was
having a great time exploring.

Then I got in and she had a lot of fun interacting with me, and she
discovered accidently that she could shoot me.  She had some wimpy gun
equiped so it would take a lot to kill me, so she was having a great time
firing away.

Then I fired back with something like a rocket launcher and blew her to
bits.  She respawned and the next time she found me, she had a better weapon
and killed me.  She was quite happy.

But then I respawned, and she killed me again.  Repeat this a few times, and
she's saying "I killed him...why is he alive?".  So the next time she
fragged me, she got a rocket launcher, and started methodically blowing away
all the fragments of my corpse, to try to make sure there was nothing left
to come back to life.  Her parents swear that she had not watched any horror
movies, so she came up with the "you must destroy every bit of the corpse to
prevent resurrection" theory on her own. :-)
