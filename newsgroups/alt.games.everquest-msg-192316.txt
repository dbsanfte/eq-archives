No I think you can't get xp on greens even if it is AA xp.

Run 3 is almost as fast as jboots.  Mostly it's good for places where you
can't get a sow.  My plan is to get almost to 53 and then turn on AA's 100%
till I feel like giving up on vox/naggy raids.  A lot of my guild is lower
level than me so it'll give them a chance to catch up too.
