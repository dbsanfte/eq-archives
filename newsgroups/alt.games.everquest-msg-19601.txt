/sigh

that was me the other day at fp gate. I just got there and didnt see any
druids or shaman around and sat down to med a bit. Next thing I saw in text
that "so-and-so surrounded by brief lupine aura" blah blah blah, so I saw
(in chat text) who I thought cast it and sent a tell saying "I'd donate for
brief lupine aura" blah blah blah. Well, it was someone who was all too
happy to give me the business about being a nitwit level 35 eBay DE SK and
roleplay "I wouldnt if I could because you're evil" blah blah blah.
