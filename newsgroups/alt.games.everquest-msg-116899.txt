I started at the end of 2000, before the tweak to the engine to make it more
bearable.  I thought the worst part about starting in Halas was that I had
to go through Blackburrow in order to get my Serpent Sight spell.  I had my
gamma corrected all tweaked to hell, and a torch or lantern for light, it
was barely adequate for getting through the tunnel down to Blackburrow.
Once I had the spell, it was not as much of an issue.  I also remember
having trouble zoning from Everfrost to Halas or vice versa, as I could not
see where I was going.
