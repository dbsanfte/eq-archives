>I have recently heard in a couple different places about AMD processors having
>problems with locking up. 

The problems were with the original AMD Athlon Slot A processor. If
you are buying new, you will not run into one of these.

>Right now I'm using an AMD K6-2 500 mhz. I had been thinking of getting an AMD Athlon, 
>but after hearing this, I'm wondering.. would a Pentium be a better choice?

Sony/Verant have recently partnered with Intel to "optimize" EQ for
the Intel Pentium4 line of processors. My guess is that this is all
hype. AMD Athlons are 100% x86 compatible and can run any piece of
software that a P4 can run. "Optimized" could mean a few more frames
per second or even slightly better graphics in EQ if you have a P4. It
does NOT mean that AMD processors will not work with EQ.

Intel P4 chips are more expensive than AMD Athlons running at similar
clock speeds. Motherboards and RAM for P4s are also more expensive if
you go with RDRAM over SDRAM.

> Or do I really need to do this upgrade? 

Only you can answer that question. I can tell you with 100% confidence
that you will notice a MASSIVE improvement if you upgrade. The K6-2
was a decent processor, but the Athlon is amazing fast.

>Would it help to upgrade to WinXP?  Right now I'm using Win 98 SE.

No. Win98SE is still a better gaming platform. If stability is more
important to you than gaming performance then look at XP.

>Sorry for being slightly off topic.

No worries with the launch of SoL Hardware upgrades are very much ON
topic.

Cheers
