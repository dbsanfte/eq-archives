I might add that when looking at the server list, a server may be 10th or 
12th in the list but their population may not be much higher than the 1st 
of the same type (blue, PvP, etc.). The reason I say this is the fact 
that the server I play on fluctuates so much at all times of the day, and 
I can only attribute that to small differences from other servers in 
total number of players online at any given time.

Just don't freak if you pick the lowest populated server, only to log in 
again the same time the next day and see it tenth on the list.

If that made any sense, I hope it helps.
