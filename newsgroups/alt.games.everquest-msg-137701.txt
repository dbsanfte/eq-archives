It's okay, but it may not be accurate.  Prices change wildly between
servers.  Also, someone may give you a price based on what it sold for two
months ago that is quite different from what it sold for before.  Example:
On my server, a year ago a Sarnak Battle Shield was 10k; now it's about
1500pp.  Two months ago, an Obulus Death Shroud was maybe 3K; now it's going
for 10k.

So it's really really difficult to get an accurate answer by asking a
newsgroup or bulletin board.  Your best bet is to go to the Bazaar and use
the search function to see what other people are selling it for.  This will
at least get you a ballpark figure.  If that doesn't work, try using /ooc in
the bazaar for a price check.  You won't always get an answer, but sometimes
you'll get helpful responses.

Many people don't bother to respond to price checks in news groups just
because there are too many variables.  It's nothing personal; perhaps your
best bet is to ask someone who's a merchant prince, well-known for buying
and selling a lot.  We have a couple of folks like that in our guild.
