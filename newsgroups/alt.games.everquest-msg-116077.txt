Yesterday in EC someone asked me to /duel them.  They said to hurry up and
do it quickly.  I was AFK so didn't respond and didn't see the message until
it was too late.  I did a /who on them and they weren't in the zone, but
/who all showed they were still on.
    My question is can you /duel to avoid EXP loss death?  If you're about
to die due to poison or DOT spell or other reason (mob aggroed on you and
you got away but he's going to catch up with you and kill you), can you
/duel to die without the EXP loss (and also to leave the zone before the mob
is killed to avoid faction hits)?
    Is that considered an exploit?
