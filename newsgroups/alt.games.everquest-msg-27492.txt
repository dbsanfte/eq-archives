 This is a bug that has popped up before, until it gets fixed just make sure
that you wait a minute or so after it recycles before you use it. Apparently
feign death is also bugged after this last patch (higher failure rate).
 Monks have to put up with a lot of this kind of thing...Verant neglects
this class. My personal theory is that nobody on the design team really
plays a monk because it's very clear that Verant hasn't got a clue about
what monks need to be a balanced class.
