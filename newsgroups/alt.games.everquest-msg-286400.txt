((((( This is a copy of something I'm trying to submit to email support. 
  I tried to in game petition, which crashed me to desktop, a complaint 
I've heard several times since the recent patch.  I tried Chat support, 
there's nobody there till monday working hours.  Finally I tried email 
support, filled out the form, submitted it, only to be told I was 
missing my email address.  I'm logged on to the web site with my account 
name, and I checked, they have my valid email address.  But thats not 
enough.  Trouble is, I can't find anywhere on the form the place where 
I'd actually put my email address!)))))

Server Select is not the actual problem, but there is no category for my 
problem.


A few days ago, I crashed out of the game, and found that I was unable 
to log back in.  I have more than one machine I play EQ on, and when I 
tried logging in from the laptop, I had no problem.   As a temporary 
fix, I just switched to playing from the laptop.

But today, the same thing happened, to the same character, in a 
completely different zone, now on the new machine.

After several attempts, I tried a different character on the same 
account, no problem.  Tried the first character again, still no luck. 
Tried going back to the desktop, also could not log in, despite it being 
a different zone.

Went to a second laptop, and that one has successfully logged that 
character in with no problems.

Here is what is happenening.  I log in all the way to character select. 
  Select my character, try to log in, the load time goes on much longer 
than usual, then I get a message telling me that I seem to have crashed 
and would I like to submit information to help solve the problem in the 
future.  Whether I say yes or not, I then end up at my desktop with EQ 
not running.

This happens repeatedly, and rebooting the machine doesn't stop it, nor 
does going to the advanced patch.

Logging other characters on the same account works on each machine, just 
logging this one character on this account now doesn't on either.  And 
yet when I started EQ on a third machine, have no trouble logging in 
that character on that account!

Any ideas?


((((( I put this here, both to see if anyone had a workaround for this 
problem, or at least to notify you that its out there, and because since 
I can't actually submit my letter, I wanted to have a copy of it in case 
I could find some other way to get this info to tech support.  So, if 
you happen to know of either, let me know)))))
