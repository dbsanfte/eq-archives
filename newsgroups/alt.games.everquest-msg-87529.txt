Hi,
 Just got off eq because of systemwide message. A few people were
saying deragatory things about VI and such, and someone said they
would not log off because they just tried 1 1/2 hrs. to get on. Then a
couple of people shouted "Nice thing to say when 2 GM's are in the
zone"  What is the difference ? Are people not allowed to criticize
the company? Thanks for any insight (hope I didn't say too much , lol)
