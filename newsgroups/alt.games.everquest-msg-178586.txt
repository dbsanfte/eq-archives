My Iksar Shaman went from dubious to amiable in approximately 65 kills
(from ~40% exp towards level 41 to 0% towards 42, with very near 1% a
kill, plus a few giants in a group at 28 or so).

Of course the fastest way to raise it is probably to help kill the
Avatar of War or King Tormax, but that's a bit more complicated than
just slaughtering giants.
