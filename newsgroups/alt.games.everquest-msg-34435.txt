Totally interested.  Where are you at right now and is it permanent? =)  I'm
on Brell with a level 25 druid who could make getting around a lot easier
for a lower level partner-to-be, and am in now particular hurry to hit 60 as
I.  I've helped kick start several former UO'ers on Brell but only one seems
to have the gumption for the game and is keeping with me level for level.
Problem is, he's really a solo player on Eastern time so we don't connect
much and I've been dying to help get someone up to speed with me to partner
with.  I'm on Pacific time if that matters and can usually be found anytime
after 5:30pm (til around 11) on the weeknights and you can't get rid of me
on the weekends! (must...have...dingy...must...have...)  If you have a high
level or aren't thrilled with moving, I could always go somewhere different
too.
