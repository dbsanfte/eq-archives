That depends entirely on how you count.  PoP had the books, which
everyone could use.  LoY had more bank space, and I think the in-game
maps.  GoD had the Abysmal Sea tradeskill mecca.  DoN had the Guild
Hall and corpse summoners.  I can't recall an expansion since PoP that
did NOT have some little game-enhancing goodie designed to draw in even
someone with a level 15 main.  If nothing else, the latest expansion
will allow anyone to "play as a monster", won't it?  Luclin was the
last expansion that had new monsters for a level 5 to kill, but
everything since then has offered *something* for even the lowbies.
You can form your own opinion whether this constitutes "geared for all
levels", but there is invariably *some* content for everyone.  Can't
miss out on a potential customer just because s/he is low level...  ;)
