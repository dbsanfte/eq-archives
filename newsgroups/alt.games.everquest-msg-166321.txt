It came from necessity rather than trying to impress. The youth of
today are just plain idiots who are passed on to the next grade rather
than being held back. They never learn how to type, spell or even use
the correct versions of "your" or "you're."

They all got in chat channels, or first person shooters, together and
got even more lazy since now one was there to correct them.
