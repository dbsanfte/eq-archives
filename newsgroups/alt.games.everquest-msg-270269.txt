Enjoy!... I just happened to stumble on it today... and it looks like it 
was only announced today. I was a little surprised... and pleased. I've 
wanted to try this game myself. :)

At any rate, if this is to EQ1 what Everquest Classic is, I'd keep my 
expectations in check. After all EQ Classic doesn't have the new models, 
or access to key popular sociable newbie zones like Kurns Tower or 
Paludal Caverns, or features like the lfg tool, the bazaar, shared bank 
slots, etc, etc. I think they just recently enabled PoK access for 
players without PoP.

At any rate I'd be pretty shell-shocked playing "EQ Classic". AO "Free 
Version" might be similiarly limited... but for the price... one can't 
go wrong. :)
