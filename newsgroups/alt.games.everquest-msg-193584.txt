I am a very firm believer in the adage that a leaner is best to ask
someone who has just passed learner stage as that person is most likely
to remember all the little bits that a learner is/was thinking about.

Guides written for newbies for levels 1-10 (say) are of very limited
use, except for general information.

Not to mention the fact that SOE keeps "adjusting" the game.

But, Oh, you were talking about nit pickers weren't you {:-).
