Ahh, but big difference in me insulting a faceless corporation and you
guys personally insulting me.
When I posted my first post I was cussing at the fact Verant hadn't
done anything, and no it didn't need to be in the MotD, just a small
banner on their web site that you wouldn't have even seen.
I have not in any of my post there after attacked anyone with
profanity as you guys have at me.

I have not posted " Tyger your a pathetic piece of crap or shit or
anything else, have I, no, I have not. Why , because I don't even know
you, I don't know what kind of person you are from just your posts.
If I was to assume that you are in person like you are in here ,well,
then I guess I would think you a jerk. But even yourself said you
really are not like this in person, you just tend to get really irate
in here. I guess that's cool, we all need some place to vent.

Well, were have you lived or who do you know that's lives somewhere
"bad" don't be so ambiguous in your answer.
And no, you are not safe are you in the US, But terrorism is not
something you would be worrying about. Before all this happened the
most I would fear would be getting shot by a thief in a robbery, I
wasn't worried about planes falling from the sky, Come to New York and
walk around, everything is cool here, but look around when a plane
flybys a little to low on its way to land. Everybody looks up and
wonders. And you have to feel for them.

I never criticized anyones way of mourning did I. When did I say 
"You must do this", No what I said was Verant could have shown support
with a simple little banner.

Once again the "Un-American Cocksuckers" were Verant. Where does it
say you are one.

i.e. the topic : EQ/Verant are cocksuckers.Seems they don't give a
shit about 9/11.
