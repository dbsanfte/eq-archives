I agree.. the computer is due for an upgrade..

Yes.. I can see your point in having to upgrade a computer just to play EQ..
but anyway..

The problem IS that EQ is VERY memory dependant.. I have the following
(roughly) spec :

P4 2.2GHz (@2.3GHz)
512DDR
MSI 845ARU
ATI Radeon 8500 64MB
10K RPM hdd..

And i can run EQ :) But.. if i run let say Quake3 i get like 100fps+ @
1600x1200x32..I get like 50-75fps in MOHAA (1600x1200x32) That does not
happen by a 1000miles in EQ?!? Why the hell not.. ? The graphics in MOHAA is
really great.. much more effects ++ than in EQ, but the "world" in MOHAA is
much more limited, and you might not have 100+players running around at
once..

So.. as i said i have 512MB ram, and WinXP. When i am done playing, and go
to the desktop, and then start the taskmanager, i see there that my "Peak"
memory usage has been around 660MB! that means over 100MB swapfile.. So i
really think that EQ with all the eyecandy turned on, you would benifit from
having 768-1024MB physical ram... (Btw running 1280x1024x32) And as many
before me.. i too have seriuos lagg when i am inside the city of Shar
Vahl...
