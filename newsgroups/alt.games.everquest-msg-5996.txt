Dell sells the inspirion line and Gateway's 5300 and 9300 series laptops
will handle EQ as will IBM's thinkpad series...

Toshiba sells them as well.  The biggest thing is to make sure he orders one
that has a 3d capable video card.  Just about every make of portable has a
low-end and a high end.  Yer gonna need the high end systems in order to get
3d graphics.

Good luck!
