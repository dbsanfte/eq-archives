I agree completely with previous responses to this article. This is
ridiculous and this grieving mother is simply looking for someone to blame
besides herself for her sons suicide.  What she may not have realized is
that EverQuest may have been the only thing that kept this young man from
seeking suicide earlier.  Mental illness is very difficult to deal with and
unfortunately there are very few recources for parents with adult children
who suffer from a mental illness.  This story says a lot more about the pain
and anguish of mental illness than EQ.   I grieve for this mother, but EQ is
not to blame.
