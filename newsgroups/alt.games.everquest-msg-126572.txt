You can get to the Paladin "new spell" vendor without ever being
in the slightest bit of danger.

1.  Wait at a wizard spire (after asking the Nexus Scion for
a portal gem by saying, "I wish to journey to Luclin").

2.  When it fires (every 15 minutes), you'll be transported
to the Nexus.  There are no hostile mobs in the Nexus.

3.  Go north to zone into Shadowhaven, which is a city
with no hostile mobs.  Go to the Cleric/Paladin guild in
the east end of the city (the Clerics are in the front room,
the Paladins are in the back room).
