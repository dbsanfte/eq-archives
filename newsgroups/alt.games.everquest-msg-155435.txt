Just got to chime in here a bit Rastus. You have picked a SUPERB Class to
just "Goof off" with. Viarra, my druid is 37, and its amaing the amount of
just plain fun stuff I Can do with her in game, and still make decent ( In
my mind ) experience. If You want you can Quad, or snare kite, or Root-n-Rot
( my personal favorite ). You NEVER have to worry about finding a hunting
spot after level 34, as your choices are wide open with all the self ports.
If you want to trade skill we can do that too easily. Easier to get to
places to farm the various bit one may need.

And best of all I Can just BS With friends while picking up a fair bit of
coin porting in the bazaar.

Yup. Druids are my favorite, Lean back kick the shoes off and do Nuttin',
character class.
