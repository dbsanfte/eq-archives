I had been unaware of the change to corpse decay. it has never been an
issue, as i don't leave corpses if I can help it.

From the sound of it, it was a zone timer bug, not EQIM. 

being unaware of the corpse decay change, and having EQIM be the only
change I had made, my original thought made sense. It no longer does...
