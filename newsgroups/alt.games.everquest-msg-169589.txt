Sounds like it was just a bad day for too many people.  Getting to the
Prince, and killing him is not that difficult, but, with enough people just
not paying attention, or just not doing what they should be doing, it is
easy to make it into a disaster.  ANd, of course, as you figured out, if the
Prince was a problem, the King was hopeless.
