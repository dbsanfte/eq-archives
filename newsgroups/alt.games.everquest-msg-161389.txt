Well, the General doesn't AoE, but Fay doesn't have to be split pulled
from a crowd of underconned 56+ dark elves, including casters, either.

On our last General raid for a friend, one of our monks went LD during
some trouble with his ISP.  Splitting the cabin was horrible, ended
with a couple of deaths, and took over an hour to clear down to one
Dark elf.  Turn-in and killing V'Ghera and then the last DE included
about 6 minutes extra with no deaths and a Kedge robe drop.

Fay, on the other hand, took 20 minutes to get to, buff, and trigger,
about 5 to kill with 11 people.  I guess it's like football, anybody can
win on any single night (except Dallas).
