It's hard to say whats "BEST" of something. It all depends on your style of play. Keep in mind that My ranger is only lvl 34 So I'm just offering my point of view. The easiest tactic I have used with the ranger is fear kitting. Find a zone that has "animals". At 24 there are plenty of palces you can go. it's really basic. Just sanre the mob, panic animal and kick A$$. The alternative to that is agro kitting or root/bow. Again it's really basic. Just snare the mob and keep a good distance. Keep hitting it with your bow as you back away or hve the mob rooted till it dies. Not really the best way since you go through arrows really fast but it is an alternative. Hope that helps.
