    It's required for the rogue epic quest.

    Yes, it's level capped. And you want to raise your level because of the
"five level" rule at high levels: the mob has to be five levels beneath you
for Pick Pockets to work. That's why it was such a big thing when the level
cap was raised in PoP - it made a ton of mobs that weren't previously
pickable, like Gorenaire, pickable.

    Yes. They had to install specific code in The Bazaar when it came to
light that rogues could pick the Traders there because of it.

    Fair game.

    This horse has been beaten into horse jerkey on web boards like The
Safehouse. It's not likely to change. Mobs are designed with pick pockets in
mind now (note how many mobs drop items flagged Magic, and thus unpickable,
rather than cash?), and older content is ignored until a rogue finds some
exploit (the rumoured "rogues can pick Fungis" thing).

    Again, been suggested, been ignored, not likely to happen.
