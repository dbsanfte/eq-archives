Oh, so the sponsor got kicked out...   =P

Ignored?  Another person drops in to exhibit a lack of reading
comprehension.  "Only got into the guild based on that lie".

There is "before".

And there is "after".

And it astounds me that people can't actually grasp that...

In a world filled with illiterates, the inane arguments that someone with an
actual grasp of the intricacies of the english language must deal with are
numerous.  I realize the concept that "got into the guild based on that lie"
*must* apply to a lie *before* he got into the guild may be hard to grasp,
but perhaps you can look up those two words and understand the point.  =P

And cat tongues are rough.  Ask your girl.
