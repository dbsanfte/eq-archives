WARNING: THIS POST MAKES LITTLE OR NO SENSE TO ITS AUTHOR! READ AT YOUR
OWN RISK!

Wow, what a weird night tonight's been. It started out just great, when
I logged on a dormant character to find that her guildtag had gone AWOL.
So I did a "/w all [REDACTED]", and found that nobody was in that guild.
At this point, I started to suspect that Something Was Afoot.

I sent a tell to a former guildmate, asking him what had happened in my
absence. He told me that the guildleader, disappointed with the turnout
for a Nagafen raid, disbanded the guild on the spot in a pique of anger!
Wow, I sure was sorry to lose that guild if the leader has the maturity
of a four-year-old!

Sifting through the tells from various people who haven't seen me for a
long time, I came upon a suggestion from an old friend: he wanted to go
to Lower Guk to get himself a FBSS. Much as I hate that place (love the
froggies, though) I agreed to meet him in Innothule swamp, home of just
about nobody (There aren't enough trolls! Start a troll twink today![1])

On my way to Lower Guk, I invited another old friend, since I knew he'd
love to get his hands on an FBSS for his twink ranger. He had to travel
from Freeport, so we decided to zone in ahead of him, to make sure that
the camp was open.

As luck would have it, it was open, and we ITU'd and started heading in.
That's where things went wrong again. Parts of LGuk are a mix of undead
and live mobs, so you can't be invis to the whole zone. And of course a
bat decided that I looked mighty tasty. And of course I fled in a state
of total panic[2]. The silly thing is, the bat was green to me, and was
no real threat, however I decided to flee[3] through the aqueducts, got
distracted by angry tells from the party leader, and drowned.

!gniD

One level poorer, but one experience richer, I ran back, where I hooked
up with our third intrepid adventurer. This time we made it to the camp
without a hitch, and proceeded to whack froggies left, right and center.
The group was a 47 paladin, a 51 magician, and a 47 cleric (me), by the
way. During a med break, the paladin mentioned that he'd killed some 30
Frenzied Ghouls, and that we might be spending some time down there.

That was not to be. On the second spawn cycle, said Frenzied Ghoul made
its appearance. We smacked it down quickly, and when the paladin looted
it, he went absolutely bananas. He'd finally gotten his sash. We'd been
there for like 30 minutes, and half the job was already done.

However, the mage hadn't gotten one for his twink, so we stayed. On the
fourth spawn cycle, Mr. Frenzy paid us his second visit. We joked about
how cool it would be if this one dropped the FBSS too, but we knew that
our chances were slim. Imagine our surprise when the paladin repeatedly
exclaimed "OMFG!" when he looted it. Sure enough, we now had two sashes.
The others asked if I wanted to stay for a third sash ("Hey, it's worth
6k!") but I decided the odds were stacked way against us by now.

So is there a point to this rambling, disjointed tale? Well, I have two
questions for you guys:

1) What's the best stroke of luck you've had on an item camp?

2) Was the paladin misled in thinking that the FBSS is a very rare drop
off a somewhat uncommon mob? I still have trouble believing the luck we
seem to have had...

3) (OK, I can't count) What kind of an infantile child disbands a guild
just because not enough people show up for a raid, anyway? And does the
phrase "pique of anger" make any sense? It looks kinda weird to me, but
that could just be a lack of sleep.

Rune, who's been awake for 29 hours now, and wants to go to sleep.
