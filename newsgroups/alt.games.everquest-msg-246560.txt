   Well, Lenny and picked up a couple of copies of CoH today.  The
installation went without a hitch.  Getting on a server was a bit dicey. 
The logon server seemed flakey, and it took a couple of minutes till we
were finally able to get into the protector server.  We started to roll up
our first servers.  Then we got to the first screen of picking the avatar's
height and size... and could not see our characters.  At all.  
  
 And then we realized that our video card's don't meet the minium
requirements.  /smack selves in the head!  Well, that's just loverly.  Yes,
we're going to get new ones, next week.  But right now all we can do is
listen to the good word about this game, look at the pretty box it came in,
and glare at our computers.

   And when we do finally get in, no doubt we'll be too low to group with
any ager's.  /pout
