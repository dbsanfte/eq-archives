  I think the point (and it's a valid one, if true) is that they were busy
DELETING POSTS asking if the servers are down, why they're down, and when
they'll be back up, while they COULD have been spending that time and energy
replying to the messages or making some sort of update on the situation.

  It makes fine sense to delete the posts after an answer has been given,
though.
