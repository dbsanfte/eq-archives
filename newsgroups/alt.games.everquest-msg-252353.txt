Trouble is -- once the mind is fried, its not capable of making its own 
decisions anymore. If this was "watching TV" then I'd agree with you.

But when you wake up with your brain chemistry tweaked so that the only 
thing you want is another fix... what exactly is going on here?

You are arguing the the individual should be free to choose drugs... but 
once his brain chemistry is knocked out of whack, he becomes a slave to 
them... he's not choosing to get another fix... he's been literally 
rewired to think he needs one, to care for nothing else. Is that 
freedom? Shouldn't society intervene to break the cycle... or should we 
just let him rot in an alley so he can be 'free'?

That's a strawman. I never said anything of the kind. In fact I 
explicitly said that alcoholics ought to be legally restricted from 
access to alcohol.

No. Drugs chemically alter the mind and body in a far more profound and 
signficant way in a larger number of people than an hour or six of 
Friends reruns ever will do any number of people.

My experience is Canadian. But I've never heard of someone spending 
large chunks of their life in prison, even in America, because they got 
caught with a joint in their pocket on multiple occasions. I'd have 
thought that sort of thing would make the news here... but maybe not. 
I'd be interested in a cite.
