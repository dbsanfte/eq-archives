This is what doesn't make any sense to me.  According to people who have 
used ShowEq, Verant no longer passes raw EXP numbers to the client.  
Instead they pass a a ratio from 1/330 to 329/330 or so, basically the 
number of visible pixels in the EXP bar.  

I would be suprised if Verant changed this just in time for the hell level 
change.
