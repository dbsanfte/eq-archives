If you're having a problem logging in and the system is telling you that
your Game Card does not exist, there's a way around the problem.
Find the testeverquest.exe file in your EverQuest directory and run that.
After the Test patcher downloads files to you, click cancel (you don't need
to actually log onto the Test server, just download the files). Then log
into the game as you normally would (you'll probably end up downloading a
few more files).

This should let you in the game again.

We're sorry for the inconvenience.
