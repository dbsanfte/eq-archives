So its still only available every 5th mob in a fast killing xp group (and
who the hell would want to be in a slow killing one :)

The down side of that is that the other damage dealing classes have to
throttle their damage output for the warrior to hold agro which more than
removes any dps advantage a warrior has over a knight.

That would probably be a bit unbalancing, As you've noted Furious is
definitely superior to defensive in most situations. Not to mention it would
negatively effect warriors in raiding situations where defensive is
important, the big fights can last well over 3 minutes in which case 30%
reduction over that period of time is far more advantagious than 10 seconds
of invulnerability.
