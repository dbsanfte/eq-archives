So you spend six hours WAITING in a zone for a particular spawn, then
WAIT 'til you hp and mana come back after the fight, then go to bazaar
and WAIT for someone to buy your old gear.

(Come on Verant, less waiting and more playing please!!!)

If you go to bazaar, and turn yourself into a vendor, do you still use
up food and drink?

I am in EC at the moment, where is Bazaar in relation?
