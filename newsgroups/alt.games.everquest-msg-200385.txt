Most of the first level of Seb will still be light blue at 65 after
the change, except krups/ilis and some crypt mobs. 61s and 62s might
go there for exp again, but don't think too many 65s will, especially
considering how far out in the boonies Seb is.

That said, even now there are a few too many level 60+ types there 
farming cash, items, faction, whatever. On my server the bugs camp 
is pretty much locked up tight by soloers.
