Nah, VSR isn't that tough if you have a good and experienced group, but it
sounded like the person who started the thread is a VSR newbie...gonna need
at least 3 groups if many of the folks that go have never done it, or
anything like it, before.  Most people haven't...hell, I'd wager that most
50+ haven't.  It's just that most of the 50+ regulars here are blessed with
being in raid guilds or group with the same talented people all of the time.
