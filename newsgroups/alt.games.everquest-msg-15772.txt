Hi

Interesting, I have been doing more or less the same thing.  I have 5
chars up to 15-20 now.  It took ages and I did it to find out which I
would prefer, used to be 8, but that was getting really boring.

I am finding also that travelling the world of Norrath and socialising
are what interest me, simply whacking things for hours wears a bit thin
after a while.  Grouping is good but I find it hard to get a group
sometimes (which is a pain with my warrior at 17 as he has to sit and
heal after a couple of blues or a white)

I also play an awful lot and want to reduce this (as does my wife and
kids, rightly so).

I think its about time now to decide who to go with in the main but not
necessarily delete the others as a) I put a lot of effort into them and
b) Which char depends on my mood.  Finally I think it will be easier to
play and get enjoyment over a shorter space of time if I play smarter
and think rather than following the crowd.

Interesting dicussion thanks.

Stephen.
