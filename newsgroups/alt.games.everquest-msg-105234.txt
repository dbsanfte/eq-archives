Petitioned last night to have my surname removed on my Wizard. I gave no
reason other than, "I picked it when I first started playing the game
and I really don't like it anymore."

For the record, the Surname was "Ruinstalker". (I almost went with
Runestalker since I can never find the damned ones I need.) I picked it
early on because it sounded cryptic or some bullshit, but I hated it
almost immediately. But anyway, it didn't violate the naming conventions
in any way, nor did I claim I had "divorced my wife" or any other
bullshit.

Apprentice responded in about two minutes saying it was being forwarded
to a GM. GM showed up in zone about fifteen minutes later. Surname
removed, /salute, "Good hunting", etc. Petition closed.

So yes, Virginia, you *can* change/delete your surname now for no damn
reason at all, providing it doesn't violate the naming conventions.
