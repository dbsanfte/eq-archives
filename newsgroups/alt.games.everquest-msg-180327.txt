    Well, thats a discussion I'll happily have, but not here, as it is Off
Topic. If you want to continue it in email or a more appropriate group let
me know.

    Having wasted a post on it now, I'll admit that was kind of the thrust
of the tongue-in-cheek portion of my original post - I both wanted to
express regret that somebody couldn't just rez them, as well as hint that
horrible though the deaths of 7 people is, its got absolutely nothing to do
with everquest. Three million people (mostly children) die of malaria (a
treatable disease - their deaths almost all preventable) every year and
that's not discussed here either... we needn't go into the list...
