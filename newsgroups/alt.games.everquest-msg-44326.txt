Anyone

Reading further into this thread I know you mean that your gates have been
collapsing more, recently.

Nope, haven't noticed any change.  They still collapse for me fairly
regularly when I'm down to 20% health and have exactly enough mana and head
start on a critter to cast Gate. :)

They have a 5% chance of collapsing, I believe.  It seems to me it's about
right...about 1/20 of the time it fails on me.  But I've also had it fail
twice in a row (this was a few months ago).
