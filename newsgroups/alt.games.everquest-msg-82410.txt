That is a bug.  According to posts from Abashi on the official boards,
there aren't supposed to be any killable NPCs on Beta Neutral.  In
fact, he even said in one post that there wasn't supposed to be *any*
way to lower your Beta Neutral faction.

Anyone who kills that guy and takes a Beta Neutral hit should petition
to get their faction fixed, and submit a bug report.
