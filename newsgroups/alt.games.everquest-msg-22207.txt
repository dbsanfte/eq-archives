It is not that I want "kitty" to be an adjective, it is that I have no
choice in the matter. And, even if it wasn't, it would still be a phrase.

Dictionary.com list these meanings for phrase. Note especially the first
meaning. If you have some other, new meaning, that renders these void,
please list it.

"Blue dog" or "kitty cat", as  phrases, are defined by ALL these meanings,
as far as I can see. And, they only need to be defined by ONE, to be
considered  phrases.

phrase (frz)
n.
1.    A sequence of words intended to have meaning.
2.
    a.    A characteristic way or mode of expression.
    b.    A brief, apt, and cogent expression.

3.    A word or group of words read or spoken as a unit and separated by
pauses or other junctures.

4.    Grammar. Two or more words in sequence that form a syntactic unit that
is less than a complete sentence.
