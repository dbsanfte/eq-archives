Ok. I apologize. I really should know this by now, but can someone
please tell me about gem slots being mapped to hot keys? I see
screenshots all the time that show a gem (or even equipment ftm) on
the hot key bank.

Now, the spell is already accessible right there on the gem bar. What
does mapping it to a hot key do for you (other than the obvious "Hey
I'm mezzing this mob - back off." accompanying message being tacked
on)? I mean, do you just drag the gem to the hot key like you would
from an ability? If so, does it still let you assign a message to go
along with it?

Perhaps someone could just direct me to a complete source of
information for hot keys and their various methods of use.

Thanks.
Rumble
