The only guides I'd ever buy is Prima.  They have guides for each of the
expansions but it seems the ones I use are the Kunark one (good spell
listing in that one) and the Luclin one for all the new stuff added when
Luclin came out.  Keep in mind that the minute something is bound in a book
it's immediately out of date so some of the information is gonna be wrong.
Just gotta write in margins the changes.

The Prima guide to Kunark really helps me alot.  I'm not all that familiar
with other classes so I use that to look up what the class can do and what
spells they have.  Sometimes this gets me some stares in groups, they can't
figure out how I know what they can do so easily.  I put tabs on my book so
I can have easy access to all the classes, and the spells are easy to look
up by first letter.   It has a few typos and some things have been changed
since Kunark came out but I still use it every time I log in.

The recommended websites are great.  I use them all the time too.  Also
check out http://www.eqtraders.com

Good luck
