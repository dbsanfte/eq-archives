OOC is *for* out of character chat. What, you complain about auctions in
/auction too?

The VI PnP rule on "overuse" of channels seems directly targetted at the
idiots who spam the same thing endlessly with the sole purpose of irritating
or flooding folk out... I doubt you'd find any sympathy if you petitioned people
for holding a conversation there....

Shrug. One mans pain, and all that. Why should you be able to tell them to
stop using a function of the game?

I have no problem with OOC chatter... if I want quiet time I turn it off,
or move to another zone. Thing about Multiplayer games is you have to be able
to deal with other people having other ideas than you, or the whole things
going to become a struggle in grief very rapidly.

These are the reasons I dont level in LOIO or Velketors ;) The OOC spam seems
more frequent and more idiotic than elsewhere.
