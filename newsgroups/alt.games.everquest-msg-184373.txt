Up the ram to at least 512. Switch to an Nvidia card (GeForce flavors and
up)
which it should work well because Im guessing your motherboard being p4 is
AGP 2.0 compliant (just guessing).

Your cpu and HD are more than efficient. Your performance problems are due
to your current video and ram setup. Setting the pagefile and a good defrag
would
only make a minimal difference.

If you are looking for some cheap parts I always hit up www.pricewatch.com
Hell, I've built some good computers from there. Prices can be good
sometimes.

Good luck!
