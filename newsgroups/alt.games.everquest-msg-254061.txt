Paladins:
6 - Bash - goes up quickly on its own (requires you use a shield)
10 - Dodge - goes up quickly on its own
17 - Parry - goes up quickly on its own
20 - Double Attack -- goes up quickly enough on its own, and while the 
extra damage is nice, its not a big deal to work it up from 1 point.
30 - Ripost -- goes up very quickly on its own.
40 - Disarm -- virtually pointless, and not worth spending points on, 
and in some cases increases mob damage output if it works, and often 
causes lost cash as people frequently forget to loot the non-magic 
weapons you've left lieing on the ground in group-ML situations.

You are quite right about monks with mend (long recycle time - slow to 
advance), and even feign death (it being such a lifesaver right away) 
being worth some training points, but paladins -- there's nothing 
comparable that's worth it.

Then again... since there is nothing comparable that's worth it, there 
is no harm 'wasting' them on whatever you want either =)

Myself, I'm just sort of holding out for the day Sony adds some new 
skill that goes up interminably slowly but is worth having...but I've 
had those hundreds of points saved up for years now. =)
