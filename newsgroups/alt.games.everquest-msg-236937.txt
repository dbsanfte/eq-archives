STA: +5  CHA: +9  WIS: +9  INT: +9

Recommended level of 60.

Which sells for around 7k lately. It is a LDoN drop.

She is not uber twinked but she is my main so I don't have huge amounts of
plat to throw around :(. Her helm is purely because I hate human helm
graphics, but I will soon be getting a Crown of Goblin Nobles which is no
graphic but much better stats
