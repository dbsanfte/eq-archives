Yea, it does sound as if carpenters were left out in the cold this time. As
a weaponsmith, I have to like the new attune scheme, and I don't see why
something similar couldn't be done with boxes, accompanied by a scheme to
make it necessary or at least very commendable to buy new boxes for each
tier.

Furniture also need somehow to become more desirable to those of us who
don't want a big apartment and never get a visit from someone we care about.
No idea how, though.
