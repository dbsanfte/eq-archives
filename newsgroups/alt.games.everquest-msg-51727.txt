Here's the problem with that: If you play your character to be an
asshole, people are going to assume you are an asshole. RPing can add
enjoyment to the game, but playing a character who as difficult to get
along with is going to make people not want to group with you. Unless
you're looking for an opportunity to role play a cleric who never
advances because people run away screaming rather than deal with you,
I suggest you look for more depth in your character.

I roleplay my characters to a degree. My Iksar necromancer can't tell
mammals apart and believes that they only pretend to have different
genders in order to feel more like Iksar (except for barbarians. All
blue-faced barbarians, he assumes are female.)  My Dark Elf cleric is
always seeking converts for Innoruuk. and has an emote for lesser
heals that reads, "Innoruuk rarely troubles himself with boo boos, but
today he will HEAL you."

None of these things effect game-play or have been particularly
off-putting to other players, but they make the characters more
memorable.
