Playing my young rogue alt in Kurn's Tower, I noticed that I could not keep 
from drawing aggro. Ever. I would wait off to the side for a pull. When the 
puller returned with the mob, I would wait for the puller to build a little 
hate before stepping up. Every time (not some, not most, every) as soon as 
I got within melee range, the mob would turn on me. This happened before I 
ever took a swing. 

I tried to stay at the very edge of melee range, but that didn't help, so 
it wasn't proximity aggro. I was among the higer level members of the 
group, so it wasn't going after the "easy pickings", either. I was well 
over 60% HP about the whole time, so it wasn't going for the kill shot. I 
found that evade, even when it worked, often didn't ditch the aggro. I will 
admit that I'm only in my mid-teens and may not have my evade macro ironed 
out just yet, but it worked pretty well in other circumstances last night.

I'm an agnostic dark elf rogue hunting in a skeleton-infested tower. Where 
is this crazy aggro coming from?
