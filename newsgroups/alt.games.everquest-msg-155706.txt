I didn't mean just Nexus, I meant anywhere.  And again, hybrids don't need
KEI...but I'll go further.  Hybrids don't need mana regen in groups.
SOLOING, it comes in damned handy...but when soloing it's worth the 100p.
There is no necessary hybrid buff.  There's a few "pretty nice" buffs, but
no show-stopping need for them.  If you don't have KEI/C2/C/B just tell your
group you're there to kill stuff, not be a buff whore.
