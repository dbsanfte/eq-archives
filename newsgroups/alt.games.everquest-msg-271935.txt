Grouping in wow is always focused on doing a quest.
People send out a public request for more people to complete xyz quest.
They gather, group up, buff and do the quest.
After that they may do another quest, or go their own ways.

I have experienced no group "grinding" in wow. If you want to grind you dont 
need a group.
Quests are usually better xp and loot, tho perhaps soloing to farm 
tradeskill will show a better cash profit.
