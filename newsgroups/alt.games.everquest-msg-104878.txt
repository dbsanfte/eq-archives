Gem inlaid ones are nice and relatively easy to get.  Try to find a
druid or wizard to port you, or be ready for a lot of running back and
forth.  Iksar scaled gauntlets aren't bad, either, though they are a
bit heavy.

After spending 72 playing hours in the Gorge of Xxorb, including one
hellish 24 hour continuous stint, without the goblin alchemist ever
popping, I would most definitely say to stay far, far away from the
Treants.  If you happen thru the zone and find him up, then by all
means get it and show it off as a badge of honor, or just to make the
other monks cringe and envy you.

Remember that neither are the lightsource that Wu's is, so if you're
human be prepared to be blinded again if you don't have a replacement.
