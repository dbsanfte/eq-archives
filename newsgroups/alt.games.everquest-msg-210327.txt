Outside the castle in Gulf of Gunthak there is a large stairway with 6
Initiates that are level 45, melee, non casters and should be damn easy at
52.  Spawn time is a little slow, but they drop fire jewels and have a rare
chance of dropping a charm (Mammoth Tusk Powder and I think a couple
others).  Each can be pulled single except the top two that sometimes add,
but once the spawn is broken you can pull them single without a problem.
Fair warning pull the top two initiates down the stairway since there are
Shaman behind the doorway in the castle that will heal/buff/sow your
targets.
