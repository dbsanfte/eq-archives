I heard that the Al'Kabor spells where usable in the BETA of EQ. It could
hit unlimited targets in a small area. While the mana cost was too high to
use effectivly, it could help a group who where overswarmed by low lever
MOBs.

These days Al'Kabor spell lines have been nerfed, they limited the targets
to 5, but never changed the mana cost. So in the end, we end up with a spell
line that is unusable because it drains too much mana compared to the damage
it deals. Other AE spells damage 4 mobs, so that 1 MOB extra for nearly
double mana seems silly. Also note that Al'Kabor's do less damage than other
Pillars/Collumns etc.

This spell line isnt really worth using soloing in any case, since it always
cost a fortune to cast, however in the past it could be used in groups with
higher efficiency.

Will this spell line ever get back some glory, or will it always remain
broken?
