Yes www.eqatlas.com/atlas will list all the cities and allow you to look
at the maps - with the alt-tab enabled now you can use that site while
playing.

However IIRC the mapping tool is available to all players now for newbie
yard zones - hit backspace and if a window opens then you have that tool.
Should have most vendors listed on it.
