Ah!  Now we see what I was looking for!  To quote, "they would >>have to<<
shut up and be respectful."  You see, many, perhaps most, of these kids have
parents who can't afford to send them to private schools.  Therefore they
would have no choice but to sit through these religious sessions.  And since
the government has laws that say kids have to go to school... erm... well,
would you think it would be ok for the government to *force* you to take
your kids to one church out of each religion every Sunday (or if you don't
have time, you could just make the rounds -- Christian today, Muslim next
week, Mormon the week after...)?  Not only so, but these schools are there
so that people who can't afford an education can still get one... even if
education wasn't mandatory, the government would in effect be saying, sure,
you can have free education, but only if you sit through these religious
services.  Which, of course, would also be a clear violation of 1st
Amendment rights.

Correction:  It's the whole "freedom from being forced to sit through
religious services you don't agree with" thing.

Yes, but *I* have a problem with forced attendance at religious services,
even if you don't.  And, frankly, you're a jackass if you think everyone
else should sit and listen while you pray to Jesus whether they want to or
not.
