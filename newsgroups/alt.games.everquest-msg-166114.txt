Yeah, I had that problem for a while too.  I had bounced a check then a 
few months later I moved.  Took months for the bill for the bounce to 
catch up to me.  By that time, my bank credit was totally screwed.  In 
the intervening time, I didn't have a bank account.  When I decided I 
was ready to get another checking account, almost a year after I bounced 
that check, I went to the banks in my area.  Not a one would let me 
start a checking account.  I finally was allowed to start a savings 
account at one, a few weeks later, since I was a 'customer of the bank', 
I could open a checking account without the credit check.

BTW, I did pay off the bounced check once I was aware of it.
