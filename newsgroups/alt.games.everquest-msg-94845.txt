  Correct.

  It's still a useful spell for casters to learn, since there are a few areas
(like the gypsy camp in North Karana, and High Keep) where you can get bound but
there aren't any soulbinders.  Also, sometimes soulbinders are located near a
guard or other mob that will kill you on sight.  Plus, it's just a
convenience... you can bind closer to where ever you'll be hunting if you know
the spell, and save yourself a little running if you die.
