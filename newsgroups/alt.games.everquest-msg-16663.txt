You need some kind of file list maker.  I have yet to find one that 
combines ease-of-use with low cost.  Shuffleplay was fairly good:

I keep meaning to check out Where Is It? at http://www.whereisit-soft.com/ 
but the cost is pretty high at $40.

You can also do simple DOS stuff: dir *.mp3 > mp3list.txt

Hope this helps!
