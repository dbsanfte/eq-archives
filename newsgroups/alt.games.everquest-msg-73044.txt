Very good idea...
Maybe I should stop just twinking newbies for nothing and
actually give them something to do :)

I cannot damageshield them, but I can at least keep them healed all the
same...

Farthest I have come in your way was telling some monk to get me
some rebbies rat whiskers for faction and getting her the quest components
for her first 3 sash quests in exchange....
No roleplaying though..

Better get out of here and start playing :)

See you,
