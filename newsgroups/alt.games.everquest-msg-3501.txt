    Okay, I never had this happen in either EQ or Asheron's call.  But a
very amusing episode that happened around me one morning went something like
this:
    I was sitting on the dock of the bay... er, I mean I was on the fishing
pier in Qeynos, fishing, when I heard a shout, "anyone who wants to marry a
cute half elf, come to the gate in South Qeynos."
    Intrigued, I sent the would bride a /tell "What sort of scam is that?
There is no gate in South Qeynos."
    "I meant North Qeynos."
    Now I was still a little curious, so I went to the Qeynos gate to see
what she was upto.  There I saw the 3rd or 4th level half elf, hanging out,
presenting herself.  She immediately thought that I was responding to her
ad.  "So how do we do this?" She asked.
    "Oh, don't get me wrong.  I'm not here to respond to your shout, I'm
just curious what you're about with that sort of thing."
    "I want to get married to someone in-game," She pleaded.
    "Ah, okay.  Good luck."  I sat to med up a gate spell since I suddenly
felt the urge to go to Faydwer.
    "What about you?" She asked.
    "No thanks, you're not my type.  I'm not really into mail order brides."
    "I just want to get married, I'm not a slut!" she exclaimed.
    Rather than laugh in her face, I gated to the Faydark.
