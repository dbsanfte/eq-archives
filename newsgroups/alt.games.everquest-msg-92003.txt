I have no beef with the price at all, and I think for the type of people
(hard core) that will be attracted to the server they will get good value
out of it. It's definately not my cup of tea though, I just don't take EQ
that seriously.

For those that are choking over the 40 dollar price tag - remember that no
self respecting uber-leeter would be without 2 accounts as well.... : O

*coughs*

<<definately>> not my cup of tea...
