They don't have to turn the servers on in the morning either. But that's 
not exactly relevant. If they want to keep the single group players from 
quitting they do have to worry about it. And uberguilds for all their 
posturing -need- fresh recruits to come up the ranks... and they aren't 
benefitting from the current PowerLevel-GearBuying sort of player. Whats 
the game going to look like another 5 years from now? Level 100? And 
nothing to do but ldon3 for 95 levels + 2000AA? After all if they 
'waste' their time in Omens of War content they'll just end up with gimp 
gear that will making them laughing stock of their groups. At which 
point you can apply to a raid guild... or quit and play something else?

Single groups are the bread and butter of EQ, not raiders, and they 
always have been. They should cater to them more than they do.

EQ didn't start out this way, it changed into what it is today. It can 
change again. There is nothing about the way it is now that is 
inherently better than the way it was.

I'd have to say raid gear would make the game harder. After all, time+ 
geared players won't have any edge in single group GoD trials. Not only 
does it level the playing field, but it makes the game harder (more 
interesting) for raiders while not putting it out of reach of the more 
casual crowd. Sounds like a win-win situation to me... except of course 
for your astute observation that you wouldn't be quite as uber when you 
weren't doing one of your raids.

But then I thought you liked the game -hard-.

Try playing the game as a modern untwinked, nonraider without bazaar 
gear. I think many raiders would come to a new appreciation for the word 
"hard". =)
