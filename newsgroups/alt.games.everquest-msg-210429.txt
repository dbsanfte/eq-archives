-- Thanks all, makes sense. I guess I thought LoIO was a newbie zone
also but I guess not.  Back when I first started playing EQ in 2000
there weren't in-game maps at all so to me right now it's still a
luxury. Plus, of course there is still EQAtlas, which is still a great
resource.  I'm used to the old, hit LOC, write it down and if you die
go back using LOC to find your body....
