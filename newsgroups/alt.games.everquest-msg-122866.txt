    One of my guildmates had a circular route he used to run in Nurga, IIRC,
that killed pretty much every goblin in the place. A round trip was 20-odd

    How, as a monk, do you deal with the damage shields? Out-regen them,
2HB, a right-click Annul item? I remember my 50+ rogue leading a rescue team
