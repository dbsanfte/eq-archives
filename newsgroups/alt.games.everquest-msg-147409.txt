Funny, only person I've EVER seen say...

"I don't give a shit about them.
Who cares. Not me, people die. Fuck em'"

...is you.

WE DO CARE, bastard.
We, however, are not insecure enough to need everyone else to tell us
how much they care.

Speaking for myself (and I'm sure many, many others), I care a great deal
when anyone dies. It is a tragic thing. (I would disagree that the death of
many is more tragic, because that implies that the death of one is less
tragic
than the death of many, which I think is an insult to the one, but still).
I do
not, however, run around town screaming that people should remember
and cry forever. And I certainly would not call Verant any of the names you
chose for them because they did not cry as much, or in the same way.

I'm rambling, but you're pissing me off a tad.
