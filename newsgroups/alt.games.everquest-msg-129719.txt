All of which are done better by other classes.

Druids are decent at soloing but suck ass on raids.

Wizards out nuke me, strength buff is useless and over written by Shaman
buffs anyway, Clerics over-write my skin buff, CH is a broken spell
that makes all other heals pale in comparison. DoTs are for soloing,
 uber-mobs resist them and regular grinded mobs are dead befor the
dot is even half over makiing it extremely inefficient mana wise. Damage shields are
nice in grinding but minor on raids, regen is also nice grinding but also minor
on raids. The debuffs are a joke, resisted a lot and draw way too much agro
in some cases.

Been there, done that, ,banged it, smoked it, jumped it and got the T-shirt.

Jack of all trades, master of none. I use my druid to port my other classes
around now. Makes a great taxi, glad I have him.
