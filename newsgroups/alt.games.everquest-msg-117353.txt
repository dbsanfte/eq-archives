In a full group yes, BUT....

Partnered with a Warrior absolutely not.
You will be healer, crowd control, nuker, spotter, and sometimes the
puller. My wife and I play as partners with these classes and she has
a ball and the xp is great. So when you need a change partner with the
warrior and leave it as just you 2.
