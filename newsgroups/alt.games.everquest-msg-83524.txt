How about Dick Weiner.  Fairly high-powered lawyer in Washington DC and 
the father of one of my college friends.  At least Mike Weiner was more 
famous for exposing his weiner all over NYC for photo-shoots.  (All very 
artistic, got him arrested and several talk-show appearances.)
Or my neighbors when I was a child in Mendicino:  Star Flower Flower and 
Flower Star Flower, twins of course.
