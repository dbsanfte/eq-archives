Which is exactly what I said, simply put a different way.  If the
politicians don't do what the constituents want, the constituents will stop
voting for them and will vote for someone else.  So they continue to allow
us our rights, and pass laws we want passed, because if they don't, we'll
vote someone in who will.  The only way this system can fail is in the case
of some massive event that causes large sections of American society to stop
focusing on the welfare of the individual American and begin to focus on
some other major concern.  In a case like that, politicians could quietly
begin to introduce laws that damage our civil liberties, even disguising
these laws in such a way that they appear superficially to be solving the
major problem at hand... so that other politicians couldn't do anything (the
laws are popular because they're supposedly solving the problem, and they
may indeed solve parts of the problem while removing civil liberties by
skillful sleight-of-hand), and the American people don't notice the "side
effects" of these laws until it's too late.

In case you didn't realize, I'm referring to the 9/11 bombing (a major and
tragic event that caused serious security problems for the American people)
and the OHS and other new establishments and laws (laws that reduce the
security problem but, using political "sleight-of-hand", remove large parts
of our civil liberties).

Would you care to give one single example (just one!) of Chirstians getting
less representation that another common American religion?  And I want
specifics, not just "Christians weren't allowed to do such-and-such" but
"Christians were prohibited by such-and-such from doing such-and-such a
thing that Other Religion #1 (substitute Buddhist, Hundi, Muslim, etc.) was
allowed to do, and this problem having been brought to political attention
was not addressed."
