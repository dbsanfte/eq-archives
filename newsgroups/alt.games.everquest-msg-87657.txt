Without even reading the rest of the answers in this thread, I already
know that you're getting flooded with the standard combinations. (e.g.
Warrior, cleric, chanter, wizard).  But if you want to be a little
different and seriously have some fun, try this:
Necro - Necro - Druid - Shaman
or even
Necro - Necro - Necro - Necro

You'll be fucking unstoppable. Not much good for the end game, or
course, but you'll have great fun and sail through the first fifty
levels like a hot knife through soft butter.
