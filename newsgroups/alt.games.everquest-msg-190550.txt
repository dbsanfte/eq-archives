Not familiar with Qeynos, but if you get out your manuals you got with the
game and expansions, in one or more of them you will find a map of Quynos
showing where the bank is.  Of course, you are perfectly safe in town, so
you could just wander around town until you run across it.  It's a good
thing to know your neighborhood.  Try talking to the NPCs.  They may have
quests that will keep you occupied.

Cheers,
Eric
