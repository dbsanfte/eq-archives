If a DC pet doubles his exp per hour at his level, then he can either 
work 9 hours, get MGB, then work 9 more and get DC, or he can work 9 
hours, get DC, then 4 and a half more and get MGB.

Since raids mean almost no exp, few people really only raid; most also 
solo or group; getting things that help you only in a raid situation 
might be useless to someone who never raids, but getting something that 
helps only when not raiding isn't useless even to someone who does spend 
time raiding

Mind you I have no idea whether DC is enough of a bump over normal 
practice to be capable of this dramatic a difference; I suspect actually 
that the best plan would be to duo with a cleric and use regular 
charm... depending on how much you despise a constant state of near 
panic; DC must be relaxing.
