The fall of the combine empire is described in your Luclin manual as far as
I understand it: Katta was the person who set up and organised the Combine
Empire. It was an empire that would include all races of Norrath. When the
deal was being sealed with all the races of Norrath (even the trolls) the
puritan Seru poisoned Katta. The elves put Katta into a stasis, but word
spread that he was dead, and the empire crumbled. This is when the remains
of the empire decided to travel to Luclin and make new beginnings there.
They arrive in what is now Shadowhaven, but many were not happy there, so
ventured out to create Katta Kastellum, which is their new city. Though some
tolerance for other races and religions has faded over the years: My Erudite
Cleric, worshipping Cazic, is KoS in Katta. Now, looking at this, I would
say Sanctus Seru is the place where Seru's worshippers gatherd... where my
cleric is KoS as well ;o)
