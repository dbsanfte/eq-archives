    Solo: clerics, warriors, anything with a damage shield. Most caster mobs 
have low HPs, and it's not hard with good Bazaar gear to be darn-near 
invulnerable to their spells. When my melees solo the exit mobs in Justice, 
they prefer to pick off the casters because of how easy they are.

    Grouped: anything with a damage shield, anything with AE nukes.
