Well, at L60 there is the added factor that the backstab formula raises
substantially, plus at L55 you start getting double backstabs, and they
take a correspondingly larger percentage of your total damage. I mean, look
at with and without stab...in a single minute, backstab on the knife at L60
is responsible for 645 out of 1240 points.

At L14:
Dragoon dirk: 128 DPM no stab, 222 with
Gloomwater harpoon (9/31, close as I could find to 9/32): 134 DPM no stab,
264 with
Tombcarver: 149 DPM no stab, 231 with.

Tombcarver goes to: 611/1140 at L60.

Because of its low damage and fast speed, the tombcarver is generally a
better offhand weapon in the hands of a rogue.
