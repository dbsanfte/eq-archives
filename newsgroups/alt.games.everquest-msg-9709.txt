An assumption on my part...but I figure your speaking of smokers?  The
reason WE send YOU outside is because WE don't want the house or workplace
to STINK!  Yes thats right STINK!  The walls yellow, the drapes yellow, and
I bet if you look at your teeth...yellow.  Why would I want my kid to stand
in a room with a smoker? So he can get cancer at an early age?  No thank
you.  So until you and your kind quit the smoking, outside you go!  No
discussions at my house, thats the rules.  I made them and I don't care if
your God, you don't smoke in my house.
