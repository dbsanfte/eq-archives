Between the bazaar closing the door on trades, and fucktards who want to
trade 3 bags of Unrest loot for an FBSS, or trade thurgadin armor MQ pieces
(hint: the odds of someone having a plate helm AND wanting leather boots AND
willing to make a straight trade of them is less than the odds of you
getting hit by a 3 ton antimatter meteorite within the half-life of a z
boson), the trade has mostly gone the way of the dinosaur.

Not that it bothers me though, since the low level tards that want to trade
their bags of crap for your item tended to not take no for an answer easily.
