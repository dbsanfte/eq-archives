I use a hardware router as firewall and have had no problems whatsoever, no
configuring needed. If a firewall is getting fuzzy about EQ what you can do
is open the ports required for Everquest in your firewall. The ports are
mentioned on the EQ Support Page if I remember correctly. The firewall will
still protect any other ports that way.
