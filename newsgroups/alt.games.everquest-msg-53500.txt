Only fair if you are equally handicapped.  I can laugh freely at
my friend who lost an eye when he bumps into things, as he knows
I also have no depth perception (and do the same thing occaisionally)

I laugh even more freely at people -with- depth perception who
bump into obstacles I can easily avoid.  If I were untwinked,
I could laugh especially hard at the foibles of the heavily twinked out
people out there who are still clueless... even though in many
cases the fact of their twinking has contributed to their cluelessness.

Unfortunately, since this is my second account, I'll never have that
luxury again; all my characters are twinked out, with knowledge
and experience if nothing else.
