I think these should sell for more IIRC.  Try selling to the guy in the
pottery shop who gave you part of your citizenship quest, the merchants
vary in prices...

Also I remember the friendship quest was so easy I bonked myself on the
head a few times for not doing it sooner.  Go pick up a bunch of fruit
just lying on the ground near certain trees in shadeweavers (also good
to eat, free food yea!)  turn in 4 to the female merchant in
shadeweavers, turn in four of the juice she gives you to the first
female merchant in the city - instant ring, I think it has a few cha
IIRC which will increase your selling prices slightly.

Also look for scorpialis (named scorpion) down in the moat around the
city near the south entrance once around lv 5 or so, he drops his tail
which is a fairly nice newb weapon (or you turn it in for one, don't
remember for sure).
