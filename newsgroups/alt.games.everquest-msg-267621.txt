I like it.
It reminds me a lot of older EQ, which I enjoyed. If they could redo the 
interface I'd be happier. It's not a 'kinder, gentler' mmog like, say, 
WoW or EQ2.

Got a friend who said, of switching to WoW/EQ2 like 'the group' is: 
(this is paraphrase)
"No, I might buy it to hang around with them, but I'm *Enjoying* FFXI. I 
didn't really *Enjoy* SWG for more than a month, maybe two. Or DAoC. Or 
EQ, or (insert Loooong list of games). I've been enjoying FFXI for 
nearly a year now, and don't see not enjoying it any time soon. I played 
the first WoW stress test and wasn't enjoying it by the end of the 
stress test. So while I may play WoW, I won't leave Final Fantasy."

(WoW is the 'everybody is drooling over it' game around here. Most of 
them are saying they wouldn't play EQ2 if they were handed the game and 
a year's subscription.)

Major suffering points of the game:
..It needs a new more modern and more responsive interface. Let me make 
chat windows dammit. And Ctrl-2 should not have to be 
Ctrl-2-hold-for-3/4-of-a-sec-till-you-see-the-macro-bar-start to-appear 
for me to use my macros.
..Could use more models. This is primarily a limitation born of 'it's a 
ps2 game'. Also, there are only like 12 faces to choose from (face 
includes face, tattoos, facial hair, hairstyle, etc in one unit). Though 
I seem to have picked a rare one for my Mithra.
..Could use quite a bit more smack laid down on the bots, especialy the 
rare item camp bots and fishbots.
..Auction House should have something like a percentage after the sale 
charge added to it... say 1-5% or something. I'd say based on the last 
year the economy could use a bit of a Gil drain to slow it down some.
..There are a couple of wierd quest blocks... I've got this quest so I 
can't get that quest because dude gives information for this quest sort 
of thing.
..They could use a full length robe and or dress model for the females. 
But I guess that goes along with a lack of pants.
A few other things I can't dredge up at the moment.

There are some real cool things about the game though;
I really like the way it does Jobs. Alt-itis has never been so painless.
Subjobs make for a great variety of effective combinations (if you 
ignore the people saying the only usable subjob for a Monk is warrior, 
etc...)
I've yet to run into a single *major* bug yet. A few minor ones though.
The boats have pirate attacks! Weee! (they are even sensible pirates, 
they come along side, summon undead on the deck of your ship, and start 
broadsiding you with spellcasters)

One of the cute things I noticed a while back, different races have very 
different styles with the same weapons. For example, with one handed 
swords, Elvaan 'fence', Galkan use big sweeping attacks, Mithra use lots 
of  short jabs and chops and vary their attacks a lot more, etc. (alas, 
monks are all about the same).

There's no PvP.. well there is Conflict, but as I don't get involved in 
Conflict (which is kind of like full contact soccer with weapons and 
spells... and a moving goal), it doesn't bother me much.

But they do give you a storyline, in the form of missions, and a reason 
to help out your country (rank, which confers many benefits). The 
storyline is epic. While everyone can go through it, you only get to go 
through it once. (though, in the interest of assisting people, you can 
go back if someone you party up with needs it and help them out.)

I love some of the cutscenes. They are all 'in engine' and very well done.

I like how they maintain the challenge of a lot of the big encounters by 
capping your level for many of the 'boss' type fights. (fought the rank 
3 dragon for someone the other night. It was a challenge, because even 
though I am 32nd level, the game capped me at 25 for the fight, and we 
didn't take a full party.)

The autotranslator is very nice... I've actually grouped with .jp 
players and while it wasn't the smoothest experience, I've grouped with 
less communicative english speakers in my time (either talked less or 
couldn't make me understand what they were saying).

ehh this is getting to long.

There's much more I like. And anyway, this is waay off topic...
