One thing that I personally enjoy now is LDON, but don't get pulled into the
"only do mistmore" groups. Sure MM is fun, but try to spread out to the
others as quickly as you can so you don't see the same thing all the time.

One other thing I did, was move to FV perma, this was the best thing I did.
I am limited to one character, sure I can start over (and have 4 times -
they were quick start overs never over level 15), but in general the people
are nicer, because they know reputation is everything here.

Mudflation is what causes the item issues where you have better than you
should be able to get on your own. But at least with LDON there are some
nice things to shoot for to make that stuff even better.

I recomend a mage personally, but try new things. Maybe play on test a
little to see what you like combo wise if it is not the ranger.............
