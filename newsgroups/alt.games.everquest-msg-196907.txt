Interesting.  You're presumably speaking from personal experience here?

Well, compensate isn't really the right word.  EQ and a.g.e fill the
the entertainment void left in the wake of the demise of my old
gaming crew... too many wives, too many children, too many miles
between our homes to meet regularly anymore.

You're right, I did slightly misstate your whine.  So it goes.

It's so cute the way you misread things in the midst of one of your
little fits.  ;)

Ooooh, I think you've got the makings of a mantra there Ed!

Well, in the spirit of kangaroo courts everywhere, I feel obliged to
point out that I'm not accusing you of anything, simply reporting my
observations and suppositions as if they were genuine fact.

Sean's posts are good reading, I'll agree with that.

Ah, I was wondering when you'd get around to repeating my own words
back to me.

Never!

That's the second time you've posted that absurdity in 24 hours,
here's a suggestion for ya:
(1) look up irony in a handy dictionary,
(2) consider the purpose and focus of this newsgroup, and then
(3) reread all of our posts to this thread.
I do hope you are as entertained by it all as I am!  ;)
