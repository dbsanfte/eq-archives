They changed the way the resists work since then.  It really is more 
difficult than it was back then.  It is still doable with a mage pet, and 
a cleric I think, but it is much more difficult than it was, the pet will 
no longer resist 100%.  Having tried this twice without success, 
including one attempt with 3 mages with fire pets, I can say with 
absolute certainty that it is not as easy as it was.  I would recommend 
the high FR, high level tank and a cleric to heal him.  More DPS beyond 
that would be handy, but not necessary.

We tried all the recommended tricks with the fire pet, getting the mage 
down below 100FR prior to casting the pet, getting the mage with as high 
an FR as we could prior to casting the pet.  Didn't matter, the pet was 
not immune.  They used to be, back when you did it.

It is definitely more trivial to do with a tank than it used to be, 
that's how we ultimately succeeded on mine, and on the other shamans in 
my previous guild.  Had a level 62ish SK to tank, along with a level 65 
ranger to help with DPS, kept everyone else outside the AoE.  We did the 
fight downstairs inside the building, placing Rak at one end, the healers 
at the door, just outside AoE range, but inside healing range.

Of course, all epics have become easier to do post PoP.  I managed to 
solo General V'Deers last night in OT, after pulling him from the fort.
