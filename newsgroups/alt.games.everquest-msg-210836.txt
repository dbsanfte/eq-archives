Yeeek - I thought my Erudite SK was a little on the weedy side but DE
warriors for their calls seem very very outmatched.

Since when did the Salvatore novels introduce an antihero rip off of Elric
- Elric was unusual but in all too mny ways he was very much
Melnibonean....Drizzt Do'Urden was a pretty standard fantasy RPG motif of
'everyone knows this is the bad guy, but actually he isnt he is the
complete opposite'. Elric could be REALLY bad bad if he wanted, Arioch
not being the nicest of chappies, he was an anti hero, DD is a pretty
standard rise above the rest straight hero concept. At least they didnt
let DE's take ranger...
