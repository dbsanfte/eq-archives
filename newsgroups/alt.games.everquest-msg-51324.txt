This sounds like a virus, are you having any problems elsewhere in your
computer.  My suggestion is to zero out your hard drive and reinstall
everything including a good anti-virus program and to then keep it updated.
I know it is a pain to do by have had viruses before and reinstalling
windows and eq may not do the job as the virus can hide in many corners of
you computer.  Also while reformatting you hard drive may be a little
quicker there is a chance that the virus may survive even this so zeroing
out the drive is likely your best bet.
