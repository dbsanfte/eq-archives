You're right; I will probe deeper when I see him again.  This time I didn't
attack him... I just asked him his purpose for being there and how we could
trust anyone who worships hate.  His reply was, "I am here only to befriend
elves in the battle against the evil gnomes.  Kill me if you must, but
this is my purpose."

There were high-lvl characters standing around itching for a low(er)bie to
attack him, because they were too high lvl to hit him.  In fact, they thought
I had teamed with him since I wasn't attacking him, and accused me of xteaming!
(which was a new term to me, incidentally)
