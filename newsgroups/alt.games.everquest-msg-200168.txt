Hmm, I gotta say, I've been among those going around grumbling about how
"they gotta deal with the KEI situation", but....having read your post I
realize that KEI has meant much the same to me as to you. For precisely the
same reasons: my ability to play EQ is the same as yours, for the same
real-life reasons.

In my case, my first character was a cleric, who I still fire up
occasionally and is now lvl 47. Clerics once past the 20s never have to wait
long to get invited into groups, which helped me limit my downtime. And I
found a congenial guild that tolerates people with my playing pattern. But
still, I gotta say, the game has really come newly to life for me with my
beastlord (level 42 and rising steadily), and KEI is a critical part of
making it work. A solo character, primarily. Without KEI Sony would have
lost me as a customer by now, regretfully.

KEI is irrelevant to this issue for the first 10 levels, maybe 20. So I
still would support KEI ceasing to be available for the early levels, for
all the reasons discussed in this newsgroup. Either that or another way to
deal with the downtime issue.
But I do see your point: for Sony to land and retain players for whom 2 hour
sessions three times a week is a _lot_ of EQ time, at the moment KEI is
essential.
