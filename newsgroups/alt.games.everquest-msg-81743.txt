    Never assume....

    Or we're in camps where mana efficiency isn't really required, like
Velk's when the place is full. Really, it takes a good group to pull fast
enough to keep my ass stapled to the ground.

    You don't know me very well. <bossy dwarf> My job is safety, not making
sure some bonehead warrior gets off on a string of big numbers </bossy
dwarf>. If making that warrior lose one discipline use pounds into his thick
skull that disciplines are to be saved for emergency overpulls and trains,
then I've done my job. If you want proof, log onto Quellious and ask
warlords like Xocin if Delores allows warriors to go berserk so they can use
the all crit /disc.

    Precisely the opposite: after the warriors realize they never died when
they were with Delores, and DID die when they were with other clerics, they
come looking for me. Anyone who can read a warrior's health bar well enough
to know ten seconds in advance when they'd go berserk and fire off that
discipline is someone you might want around when the chips are down. :-) And
the women in the party love it when I get some really dense tank to strip
naked, trying to get low enough on life to fire it off.
