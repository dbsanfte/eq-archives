I've perfected the art of misspeaking.  It's maxed at 250.

I readily and sheepishly admit lots of stupid things come out of my
mouth (keyboard).  Not so much because I haven't thought things
through, but because I don't take the time to explain myself properly,
and because I tend to use inflammatory language.  (Like saying some
people should be shot for X, Y, or Z, when I don't believe anyone
should be shot.)

However, I've got to admit, sometimes my stupidity works to my
advantage.  a.g.e seems gifted with some smart individuals who
really make me think about things, oftimes things I wouldn't have
thought about unless I had posted that stupid thing in the first
place.

That "42" fellow comes to mind as someone I *look foward to*
disagreeing with me, because I know he'll be polite but firm,
and responds with clear, well thought out responses.
