What would be the best to have in the off hand for a druid ... the Skull of
Jhen'Tra (+20 mana) or the Testament of Vanear (+10 mana, +10 WIS)?
Opinions, anyone?  It seems to me that the Testament, with the WIS bonus,
would be better over the long haul ... but I could be mistaken about that
(I've been married long enough to know that I'm mistaken about most things).

My druid (halfling) has the skull now, and I was contemplating questing for
the testament.  I've read on Allakhazam where killing Dylin Starshine could
make one KOS in Qeynos, though.  Anyone have any experience with this?

TIA,
Crash
