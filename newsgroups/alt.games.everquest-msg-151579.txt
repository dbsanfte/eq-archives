    Depends. If they have that Staff of the Silent Star or whatever it's
called from NToV, they do melee attack from time to time. And the really
cutting-edge wizards get summoned and hit once or twice (and have it bounce
off the epic rune) all the time. But I doubt anyone would call that "melee".
And I don't think Xuzl counts, either. ;-)
