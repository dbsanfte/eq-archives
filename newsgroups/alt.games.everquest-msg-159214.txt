Yes, this can work.  If you get hit, though, you can get knocked off the body.
Also, a recent bug had your empty body decay timer broken, so you had three
hours till rez... forever, since it never counted down.  I believe they tried to
patch this bug, don't know if they succeded.  Further, they said they were
patching so an empty body evaporates after 3 hours, people were leaving empties
around hoping for a rez, and never cleaning them up if the timer decayed.
