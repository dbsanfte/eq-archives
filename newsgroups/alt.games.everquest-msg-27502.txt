Hi

1. Shackle key 19 is for one of the female slaves (Wood Elf I think)

2. Shackle key 23 is used to free slaves in the Minotaur Caves in
Steamfont (along with key no. 22 I think)

3. No idea.

4. I think this is part of a Paladin Quest that starts in Felwhite.
Talk to one of the Paladins there and you should be able to get a
clue.
