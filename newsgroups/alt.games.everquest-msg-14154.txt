I don't know if it's like this now, but 10 years ago if you applied for
Social Security (in the US) because of a disability you WOULD BE auto-denied
benefits.  Those who bothered to appeal (and had an actual claim) usually
were approved.

It's a really pathetic way to do business but Verant wouldn't be the first,
by a long shot.
