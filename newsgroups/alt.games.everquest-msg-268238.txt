All the stuff you gather does have a use somewhere.  It's just that some of 
it is for recipes you might not have yet.  You have to buy the artisan 
books up to level 9 then buy the books for your profession for every level 
after that.  Buying the books will get you recipes for the items you have 
gathered.  One thing about food/drinks, if you make a food or drink it will 
last twice as long as one you buy.
