Necro's got screwed on looks and difficulty with Tri-planar requirements, 2
of them god drops.

Warriors took it up the ass on difficulty.  Tri-planar + 2 dragons and Queen
in Chardok

Bards have to kill 3 dragons, but only plane is fear.

Shadow Knight is long, involved, meandering, and tri-planar.

Clerics fall asleep on the Ragefire camp, but their epic is arguably the
most useful so they didn't get screwed.
