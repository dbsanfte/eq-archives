From a game mechanics history, the answer is pretty easy: Because
when Cheal was created, it really wasn't a very good heal. 
Sounds crazy, but the highest level person you'd ever meet was
50th level, and had gear an untwinked level 30 would turn his
nose up at now.  Cheal wasn't hitting for 8khp, certainly not its
then cap of 10khp, your tank probably had 3khp and you were lucky
to see 2500 hp heals most of the time with it.  There was no such
thing as FT, no such thing as KEI, no mounts horse -or- drogmar,
no cantata of either level; if you were lucky you had clarity or
straight bardic manasong (without any "voice" instrument" or
Amplification) and strategically you rarely saw a chanter and
bard together so you almost certainly didn't have both.  Ten
second time to spend 400 hard to replace mana out of a nice small
pool (one point of mana per WIS over 200, the pool just never got
all that big even with the best gear.... and remember that cleric
gear was just as sucky back then as everyone elses)

Even so, Cheal was nicer than the designers seemed to think it
would be, apparantly the beta testing pool never really explored
it very well or surely it would have been a level 49 spell.

But the higher HP totals get, the more CHeal is worth, so that a
level 39 cleric can be of enormous help on a level 65 warrior in
a way he never could be back when a level 50 warrior in stuff
that 65 warrior wouldn't waste trader bag space on in the bazaar
was the best recipient of the spell you'd ever see.

They've done it already; take a look at the low level summon
corpse spells, which work just like "real" summon corpse, only
there's a maximum level for the spell to be able to work on you
before you need a higher level necro/SK, with a higher level
spell and a much more expensive component coffin.

Personally, no, I don't think its all that great an idea, I
-liked- being able to be helpful to higher level characters,
healers suffer in many ways and clerics more than most, its often
a thankless task with the damage dealers basking in the adulation
of the masses.

What I think would work better, if you want to achieve the same
result, would be to put a sliding scale on how much healing a
cleric CHeal is good for; 2500 when you get it, sliding gradually
up to 10,000 at level 65.  I'm still unsure why they felt it
necessary to nerf Cheal back down like that, when tanks that can
actually get more than a 8KHP heal out of it on a regular basis
are rarer than hen's teeth even a year after POP release... but I
did feel the bite when healing druid pets in PON
