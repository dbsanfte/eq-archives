Oddly, the elves that live deep underground far from the rays of the 
sun, and journey out only into the darkest forest in the old world... 
have the darkest skin.  Similarly, the humans who live mainly in 
buildings or even underground, and journey out into the second darkest 
forest in the old world have the darkest skin of the human races... and 
no ability to see beyond their noses in the dark; at least the Inkies 
have night vision to match their dark origins.

The palest elves live in a city of light second only to some of the 
plains on the moon for brightness, I don't think you can lay claim to a 
lack of exposure to explain the complexion

I recall an odd work of art, the artists name escapes me, but it 
consisted of a block of purest white marble, flat and glossy to the 
eye... in which it was a slight depression set, but kept filled to level 
with pure milk.  It took a close examination to see the difference, 
mainly in the shape of the surface rather than a distinction of color or 
any quality of tone or hue or even gloss.  The high elves in their city 
of marble hues remind of that work; I call them milk from this.

ps sometimes I call them jolly white giants, but only in gnomish
