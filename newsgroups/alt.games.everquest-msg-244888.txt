I get tells from random buddies asking me if I have the time to alt into 
my ranger and track in certain zones because they know that i camp her 
out in odd zones like solB, or Permafrost, or even lrathe.  I have no 
trouble popping into her if i am just dittybopping around tradeskilling 
or sitting in bazaar tradering and chatting. No skin off my nose if they 
want to see who is up on track=)


A fair number of the guilds on SolRo have trackers camped out in 
different zones just to check on who is up=)
