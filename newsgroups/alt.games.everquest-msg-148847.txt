DON'T!  The reason you're having trouble creating them is probably that 
backup files exist, and if you -do- succeed in creating them, that will 
wipe out the backup file.  If you must play right now, create a character 
with a different name you've never used, and take it as a good sign that 
your characters may still exist.
