That's funny, I've seen many enchanters and shaman who got all the way
to level 60 with only 8 spell gems. Someone should tell them they
*really* need more slots.

I've got a mid 40's enchanter; yeah I have a ton of spells in my
spellbook, and more than 8 I'd like to have memmed at the same time; but
I can play very well with just 8. As much as I'd like an extra gem or
two, I agree with the other poster, it *is* part of the challenge of
playing your class well to pick the 8 spells that will help you the most
depending on current circumstances.
