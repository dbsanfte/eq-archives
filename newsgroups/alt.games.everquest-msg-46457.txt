I am not saying it isn't here or denying it.  I am saying  if you don't have
a plan to stop it then stifle it.  Your post is just a gripe session but
lacks any constructive solutions.  It's also very off topic.  We all know
there is a risk Falsa but some of us refuse to go into a cave and hide
better start digging my friend.   But as I said when your time is up it is
time to die and it doesn't matter if you are hiding or not.  We have an old
saying where I live there are two things that no man escapes:   death and
taxes.  Why promote fear to the weak with your posts everyone knows we are
at risk?  Your stating the obvious plain and simple.  I am never embarrassed
to post my opinion but I would be if I were you because it smacks of
cowardice to me.

Nobody with a boxcutter would have held me at bay without me or them going a
round and one of us ending up in a casket.  Better to die a death as a man
in battle than like a sheep being led to the slaughter.   I am over 2m
(80")tall and weigh in excess of 130kg(286 lbs) with over 50cm(20") arms and
neck and a 140cm (56") chest.  I am also a army veteran with infantry
background.  I have been threatened by Turks in Germany with a knife and
responded with violence and come out unhurt.  I know what I would have done
in this situation because I have been threatened by a knife and I have a
good idea what I can do you a human target with my size.  I also have
several weapons at my disposal and if something happens near me then it's
open seasons of them as far as I am concerned.  I faced the real possibility
of my death in the gulf war made peace with it and no longer fear it.  Who
cares if they are here we are going to be there very soon and we'll see if
they are as brave against people who are armed and can retaliate. We have
our fanatics too would like nothing better than to choke Osama bin Laden
with pork products and then tie his intestines up to a HMMV and slowly back
up disemboweling him in the process and giving him 3m(36') feet of slow
agonizing death.   We are aware now and although the likelihood is very good
that another episode will happen in both of our opinions.   We must struggle
through and live our lives and not hide in shadows as you would have us do.

I read R.E. Howard is your name a take on Thulsa Doom?
