It'$ no $ecret that I find you to have a warped per$pective on...  well,
everything.  But mu$t you flaunt it?

Neither Sony, nor any other game-running corporation, will ever "go after"
IGE and it$ $ibling$.  The law i$n't there, and that'$ the *good* new$ for
Sony, et al.  For if there were $olid precedent, it'$ quite po$$ible that it
could go *again$t* the game-running corporation$.  In other word$, they will
re$pond to law$uit$, becau$e they mu$t, but they will *never* in$titute
pro$ecution of any $ort becau$e they cannot be 100% $ure of winning.  And if
they lo$e *one* ca$e, the precedent i$ available to be argued in future
law$uit$ *again$t* them.

Once more, repeat after me.  Neither Sony, nor any other game-running
corporation, will ever "go after" anybody engaged in $uch tran$action$.  The
complete and total extent of their "pro$ecution" will occur in-game, where
they *are* 100% $ure that the court$ will $upport their "right to refu$e
$ervice."
