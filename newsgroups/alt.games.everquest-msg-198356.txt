I wholeheartedly agree. I was by no means one of the early subscribers, but 
I've been playing for over two years now. I've seen the steady 
metamorphosis of the sub-50 game into something that is sorely lacking in 
the early adventure and wonderment. Maybe it was unavoidable, maybe it 
wasn't, but I miss the days when a lot more satisfaction was gained by 
obtaining a piece of gear with far lesser attributes.

I was hoping for that on Stromm, but I should've known better. Within three 
to six months I expect that the same atmosphere of bigger, better, faster, 
more, more, more will exist there as well.
