Would you care to be more specific as to what counts as 'playing above
average' then? Quad kiting takes some skill, is that playing above average?
AE groups take some skill also (normally). Killing your average boss mob
with enough people and a decent strategy isn't 'high-risk', because there's
a better than good chance you'll win. What then? Killing the AoW and similar
mobs that are currently considered tough is the only thing that counts as
high-risk?

What exactly do people do on even a vaguely regular basis in EQ that could
be considered high-risk in the sense you may lose more exp (or loot) than
you gain? Do wizards regularly pull that 5th and 6th mob because they feel
they might be able to handle it after they've quadded the original four if
Spec:Evo kicks in enough? Do single 50+ groups pull red mobs because there
is a (very) nearly non-existent chance they may win? Of course not.

Almost nothing that people do day to day in EQ is risky at all in that
sense. If you don't think there's a very high chance of coming out of a
situation without being up exp or loot wise, you simply don't do it.

If you are rating exp-gaining groups on a 'risk' scale, then in my opinion
AE groups still come in at the high end. That may not be 'high-risk' in the
sense of taking on the AoW or Kerafyrm, but that wasn't what James' post was
referring to, it was everyday exp-gaining groups.
