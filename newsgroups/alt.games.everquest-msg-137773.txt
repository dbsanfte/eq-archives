    We wasted plenty of time on our last Burrower run! Proof you suck:
getting everyone to the far side of the invisible bridge, getting ready to
set up coffin CotH - and realizing your raid went in without a necromancer.

    One warrior with 7500 HPs actually managed to run from zone-in, to the
invisible bridge, and *all the way across the invisible bridge* without
help. He was so amazed he made it he stopped running towards us - and that's
when he found out all those mobs he trained can find the invisible bridge
without much effort.
