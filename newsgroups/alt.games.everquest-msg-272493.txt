Same time as you, we live on NSW/VIC border.
You're welcome to come hunting with us, did you end up joining the LoL
guild?  If not, I'm sure the Crusaders of Mist would love to have you.
The guild is smaller than others on the server, but they are all really nice
people and you can get a pickup group or two especially after 6-7pm.
If you wanted to know a bit more about them the website is
www.crusadersofmist.org

What does he con to you at level 20?  We were going to go down there last
night but weren't sure whether the mobs were too low.
We ended up in TS with undead farmers (white^^ to me, darker shades to the
others...heheh) and animated scarecrows but it took all of our power to take
out the groups or singles and a bit of time regenning.  I would hate to see
what would have happened if a wanderer came across us.
Ended up paying a visit  to Advisor Pandrakus (sp?) and he was really hard -
we ended up running like chickens but I am pleased to say we all lived to
tell the tale.

They may have city tasks or quests which require X number of whatevers, the
easier kill may speed up the collection process.
I think I have a city task in BB to to kill 14 broodslayers? (spiders
anyways).  So we have to go back in there sometime....we helped someone else
do the quest and even though they were grey they required a fair amount of
work as there were so many in a group (and they were being camped..hehehe)

I have to admit I have been neglecting my tradeskills, I have made a lower
level alt with the purpose of making a patron and disabling the xp so we can
get some guild xp happening.
May of the guildies have artisans in their 20's - some of them prefer to
tradeskill instead of going out hunting, the ones out hunting also gather
the resources for the tradeskillers so it works quite well.  The
interdependencies do have an effect but not as great as those soloing the
process.
