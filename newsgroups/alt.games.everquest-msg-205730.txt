My proposed solution is an extremely undesirable way of recovering
the equipment from your corpse for several reasons:

1. The long delay between dying and having your corpse timer expire
   which would prompt the teleportation of you and your corpse to
   the same area.

2. The additional experience loss by allowing your corpse timer to
   expire.

I do not think my proposed solution qualifies as spoon-feeding the
players.  It merely prevents any chance of losing all your gear
due to a corpse decaying which does happen from time to time.

I'm glad you became offensive so I can feel free to respond in kind.

Apparently your intellectual capacity is insufficient to imagine even
one scenario where your corpse might accidentally decay.  I will
spoon-feed you one sample scenario since apparently you require it:

You die.  Before you can recover your corpse your wife or one of
your children is hurt badly.  You either don't have time to camp or
in your mad scramble to camp you mistype "/camp desktop".  You spend
a long time in the Emergency Room caring for your loved one.  Your
corpse decays.  Your equipment is lost.

I will not hold your ineptness against you.
