Only a couple of spots I disagree with you.

Tank - necessary - SK or PAL my preference.
CC - necessary -  enchanter or bard - if you permit the bard to pull, you
should never have to deal with more than a 3pull which any adequate bard
should be able to handle.
DPS - agreed, would actually rather have 3 than 2.
Healer - 1 good one or 2 adequate ones.

By class, my optimum would be:
PAL
ENC or BRD
MAG&ROG
DRU&SHM
Three healing classes (paladin, druid, shaman)
Four DPS classes (magician, rogue, druid, shaman pet)
Four buff classes (paladin, druid, shaman, enchanter or bard)
Two slow classes (enchanter or bard, shaman)
Snare capability if needed (druid, possibly bard)
Evacc capability if needed (druid)
Damage mitigation (paladin stuns, air pet stuns if mage uses)

My second choice would be:
PAL
ENC or BRD
MAG & ROG & RNG
CLR
