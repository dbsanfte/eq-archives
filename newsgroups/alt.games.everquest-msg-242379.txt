}Will get the 50% rez at 34 though :)

Aye, when I've leveled up a cleric, I generally got the 0% and then waited 
to get all the earlier ones at 34ish, just so I could make less trips.  
And because I was generally 2-box PLing said cleric, so it was only a few 
hours difference. :)

}What makes me laugh is the under 40's holding out for a 96%, like its gonna

}faster!!!

I dunno, xp loss was pretty noticeable at 35, especially since, when I 
die, I tend to end up doing it more than once.  I wouldn't hold out for a 
96%... but I might go donating for a 90.  Or begging Teapray to come rez 
me. :) I solo a fair amount lately, so there's no 'why doesn't the cleric 
in your group use his 50%?'  And if I'm shopping, I might as well get the 
90.

}Found this amusing in pok the other day:

}Hmm, where can a level 13 be fighting that they need +800hp and sow just to
}get their corpse back :/

Ahh, you're presuming people only die where they're *fighting*... Perhaps 
said level 13 had just discovered that he was, in fact, KoS in Oggok.  
Or that Neriak didn't particularly welcome his presence.  I know when I 
was a true newbie, I died in more outlandish places than you can shake a 
stick at. :)

Especially at 13... This may well be the first time he's *had* to do a CR.

Of course, it's much more likely he's discovered casters are far less 
picky about donations if you append 'for a CR' to any buff request. :)
