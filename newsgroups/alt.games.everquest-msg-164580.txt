 Now see, due to the fact that you actually made some sense, I'll play nice
and post right.

1- Show intellect ?  Why, did I miss the aptitude test for entry in this
newsgroup ? You must admit your analogy is a hypothetical approach to how
you my see fit to address the players that be. Most of them I hate not as a
person, but as an idea. That idea being what is sometimes referred to as the
"Walter Mitty" syndrome. Don't think my original post in here was
rudimentary for I have been in these groups for many years.

 And if you have experienced the same abusive welcome from these predators,
then you probably understand my position. I don't expect you to agree with
me, but I have seen this way to many times. Consider me a martyr of
punishment to the refinement of the welcoming committee at hand. I take no
shit, I can be very obnoxious and annoying, and I can probably be the nicest
person in the world.

 It's just a shame the good people in this newsgroup have to suffer the
consequences, yet these same people let these self proclaimed NG gods exist
for so long.

 Sorry so long, but 'twas approached with sincerity.

Have a Great Day !!!
