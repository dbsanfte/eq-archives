Just for point of fact, since you already seem to follow this for whatever
reason, here's a C&P of the manual located at
http://everquest.station.sony.com/library/media/Man_ch03.pdf

It's page 48

"Out of Character. Speak out of the context of the game and your character.
Use this if you're having a problem or have a question that doesn't pertain
directly to the game. These messages display as bright green text to anyone
within your playing zone. Again, don't overuse this."

This is the full text.  It can be argued that the manual isn't the rule
book, but I think it shows Verant's intent pretty well.
