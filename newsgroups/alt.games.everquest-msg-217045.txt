To cure the effects?  Depends on the effect.  If it's a curse, then 
something in the Remove Curse line.  If it's magic, then you need 
something in the dispell line, which sucks because it will potentially 
remove buffs too.  If disease, then cure disease line, poison, well, you 
get the idea by now.
