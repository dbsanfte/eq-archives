Something to remember - a lot of L50+ druids don't keep SoW memorized
and most get so many sow requests its just too much a bother to
respond to every one. Once you've gone through a year or two of sow
requests its no longer in the realm of rational thought when the
millionth person asks.

Those who have equipment with clickable sow are safer to try.

My druid didn't give sow to strangers unless 1. they really needed it,
and a two or three zone run isn't "need", or 2. I was doing absolutely
nothing anyways (in which case I sowed most people on sight before
they ask). In those cases I gave it freely. I also sowed any cleric or
enchanter who wanted, no questions asked. :-)
