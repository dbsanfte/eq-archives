Gentlemen:

I have been perusing these "gaming" messageboards and I cannot help
but take note of your utterly atrocious abuse of the English language.
Have you no regard for spelling or grammar?  You are a perfect example
of what Paul Fussell has termed, "The Dumbing of America".  With your
meaningless, imbecilic slogans such as "Yo" and "WASSSUPPP," and your
preference for ghetto slang over proper English, you are a shame and
embarrassment to your ancestors who fought and died for our once-great
nations.

(A quote taken directly from said groups):

"O, d00d! 4ll my 53lf-w0rth and w4k 0p1n10n5 r b3l0ng 2 j00! I am s0
pwnd!"

Now what, exactly, is this supposed to mean?  This appears as pure
gibberish, a near indecipherable combination of letters and numerals;
none of which save a handful have ever made an appearance in Webster's
Dictionary.  Is this yet another product of our feminist school
systems -- with their emphasis on "feeling good" and "self esteem"
over structure and competence -- wherewith the very structure of the
English Language is slowly being dismantled?

Men of soc.men: these are the weeds and dross that feminism has
wrought.  The law of the jungle reigns supreme; our younger generation
thinks it admirable to behave like hoodlums.  We must not let this
continue unabated!
