Damage shield - you get offense raises from it.

Just DS - use a small nuke to pull and do at least
1pt of damage and let the mob beat itself to death.

When he reached his 50's, they parked him at the
zone in of a tier 2/3 pop zone and let him soak
xp from the 65 necro main with 400+ aa points.

Apparently this necro can solo an AA point in 20min
or so.
