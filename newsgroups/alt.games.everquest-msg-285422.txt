On top of what everyone else said about resist types, resist adjustments 
(lures) and more nuking options, here's a table showing how efficient 
the different classes are when nuking.

Assuming you both had all your spells, no foci, no AE's and weren't 
dealing with summoned targets,

Mage

Spell                 Cast+Recast  Dmg   Mana  DPS* MPS**
Scars of Sigil (54)   5 seconds    622   186   124  37
Char (52)             8 seconds    974   291   121  36
Lava Bolt (47)        7.5 seconds  815   238   108  31

Wizard

Spell                 Cast+Recast  Dmg   Mana  DPS* MPS**
Voltaic Draught (54)  5 seconds    688   176   137  35
Draught of Fire (51)  5 seconds    622   176   124  35
Ice Comet (49)        7 seconds    808   230   115  32
Rend (47)             7 seconds    855   227   122  32
Conflagration (43)    7 seconds    900   250   128  35

So, most DPS the mage could do with nukes is 124 at a mana-per second 
cost of 37.  Wizards can beat that at level 43 using Conflgration with 
128dps at the cost of 35 mana-per second.

Add in wizard innate crits and that DPS goes up.

Yes, mage pets add DPS and in some situations can add quite a lot of 
DPS, but the mage you spoke about certainly wasn't out nuking you.  If 
they were using Char then yes, you'd see bigger numbers per nuke, but at 
an 8 second cast, the DPS is lower every spell you could have cast 
except Ice Comet.

To sustain the same mana cost per second the mage would have had to cast 
Lava Bolt, reducing their dps to 108, while the wizard could keep 
casting Rend at a very small extra cost but more DPS.

The numbers are different again in groups without mez, because wizards 
can use their efficient rains (so can mages of course).

As a nuking class you'll come to learn that the big numbers don't always 
matter, what counts is efficiency over time.  This has been slightly 
altered by the out of combat system but not radically.

Once you begin earning AA and increasing your crit rate and crit %, 
you'll move beyond any similarly geared mage.

As a point of note, all spells were revamped some time ago, so that Ice 
spells were the most efficient but usually lower damage, magic based 
spells were in the middle and fire based spells had the highest damage 
but were least efficient (true for wizards certainly).


* Calculated as dmg/(cast+recast) for comparison only
** Calculated as mana/(cast+recast) to give mana per second
