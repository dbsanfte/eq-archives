The "Kamikaze" were not seeking martyrdom. It was a desperate act,
used by a desperate people. 

One man crashing a plane into the deck of a US carrier could inflict
more damage than dozens or hundreds of men attempting to divebomb or
use torpedos. By the time the Japanese began using Kamakazi's the US
held a HUGE numbers advantage. The US also had much better equipment
(F6F Hellcat, and F4U Corsiar fighters, Radar, etc) to counter any
conventional attack. 

The Japanese were brainwashed to believe that Americans were savages
that would slaughter them if they surrendered, and rape/slaughter
thier families if they were defeated. The military government in
control of Japan used this fear to fuel a desperate attempt to win one
major vitory. Thier hope was to inflict enough damage onto the
American fleets so that they could demand better terms when
surrendering. They knew going into WWII that they had no chance of
defeating the US.

I have read many books and interviews with Japanese servicemen who
"volunteered" (most were ordered or pressured into volunteering). They
were prepared to sacrifice themselves for their friends, families and
their country, but none of them wanted to die.

The Kamakazi were no different than a GI that throws himself onto a
live grenade to save his friends standing nearby.
