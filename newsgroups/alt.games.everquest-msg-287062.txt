BA984 LHR->TXL 13/June/1998

Certainty level: 100%

In June 1998 I travelled on the above British Airways flight to Berlin
with my mother, to visit her family. There were two women in seats 30D/E,
about 4/5 rows behind us. It was quite obvious from the torrent of abuse
during these flight that these women had been instructed to harass me
and attempt to obtain a reaction.

I did manage to record much of the flight, but unfortunately much of the
recording is unclear because of high background noise on the aircraft.
The following three excerpts from the recording  are the best I can do.

The segment at position 11:34 minutes on my recording contains a fairly
quiet word "paranoid", followed immediately by a much louder
"yeah, he's paranoid, yeah". During the flight the abuse was not sexual,
as it so often is elsewhere, but attacking my mental health.

One of the women in seats 30D/E said "paranoid" very clearly towards the
end of the flight, but unfortunately I had run out of minidisc space and
stopped recording by then. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that
these women were directed to harass me. This harassment happens without
fail on British Airways flights; I've been on something like three or
four BA flights in the last 5 years and it's happened each time.
Presumably this is because of international law which says incidents on
aircraft during flight are actionable in the airline's country of
origin - so my persecutors want a reaction from me, and they want to see
me "done" in the UK where they can influence the justice system.

These incidents never happen on foreign-domiciled carriers.
