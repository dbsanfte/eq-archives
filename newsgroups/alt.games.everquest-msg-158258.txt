I don't drink, so I couldn't tell you the difference, but I get a lot
of compliments in the restaurant I work in about "what good beer there
is up here" from tourists, and I had some friends ask me to bring down

brought some Piper's pale ale down for them), so we've sure got the
world deluded, at least :D
