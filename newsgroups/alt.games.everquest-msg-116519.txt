In an exp group, the cleric really shouldn't need to symbol
anybody.  Maybe the main tank, but even that's debateable.

In a guild-group, even just an exp grind, it usually does end
up like this because we know pretty much what the cleric(s)
is (are) taking in and how much they need to expend on
stones for raids.  We'd even run three mini Kael raids
just looking for armor drops where the clerics paid for everything
out of their pockets and still had cash left over from exp grouping
(with us...groups on your own time are your own loot).

I'm a rogue.  Don't cast symbol on me.  It's a waste of cash,
and if I'm getting pounded on enough to where the symbol
makes the difference between life and death, something else
is going waaaaay too wrong to worry about 12 pp.  If I'm in
a pickup group, I generally don't remember many clerics offering
to cast cash-hungry spells on all the group members anyways,
any more than the enchanters do.  It has happened occasionally,
but if I was in a straight pickup where the cleric demanded all
the stones or vendor loot drops, I'd probably disband anyways.

It's not worth it grouping with anybody of any class anyway who's
going to multi-class as an accountant.
