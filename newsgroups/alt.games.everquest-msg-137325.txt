Its something the guild decided against.   Of cause some people want to see
VT.. heck everybody wants to, but a lot of people (including the guild
leader) aren't prepared to put the massive time in, in getting VT enabled.

I personally have the idol and pouch (and AL key) but theres nothing else
for the Emp key I can achieve without a raid.. and if its not a current
guild objective - it just isn't gonna happen.

We have 1 guild in it.  Another guild has many emporer keys now, 2 more
guilds are just getting started on emp keys (dunno if you'd count us as
getting them though... its just a few people doing it on their own)

Lol...  at the lower tiers, its "noob" and slow guilds who bother making
groups, whilst the smart guilds just make FFA groups.. interesting in your
opinion how this changes later on (assuming your not just refering to
clerics with mana classes, warriors with a healer.. bla bla)

Wow l337 spoiler thx!   Lol i don't think its anything we won't figure out.
26 sounds about the numbers for a close TiV fight, think 28 is the least
I've seen, so i guess they are pretty similar fights
