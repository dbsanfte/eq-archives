   My analyst told me that I was right out of my head 
   But I said "Dear doctor, I think that it's you instead 
   'Cause I have got a thing that's unique and new 
   It proves that I'll have the last laugh on you 
   'Cause instead of one head... I got two 
   And you know two heads are better than one" 
         -- Closing stanza of the song "Twisted"
            (popularized by Joni Mitchell on her
            classic "Court and Spark" album)
