I went through those levels long before there was a Natimbi.  Most of the 
places I saw necros soloing were more wide open, and generally they used 
agro kiting strictly in those areas.  Plane of Storms frogs (Those 
bastards hit damned hard too), and much more recently now, Plane of Fire 
tables, still same strategy.  Of course, being a necro, there is also the 
get out of jail free card of FD (unless you fizzle or get caught and 
interrupted :b).  The few times I soloed with a 10 charge snare gland, I 
was appalled at how it trivialized the soloing, and gave lots of thought 
to working on a necro again. :b
