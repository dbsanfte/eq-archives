I've never been able to figure out that command, either.  I'd love to 
hotkey the channels, but I just can't get it.

I had my Slot 1 Celeron 300a OC'd to 450 from day 1, and it ran solid for 
over 2.5 years with the retail fan/heatsink.  Abit BX6-R2.  It now has a 
1.0gig Celeron in it ( not OCd, runs nice ) and will take a 1.1.
