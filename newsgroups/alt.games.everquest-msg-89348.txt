Well. *sigh*. I'm kind of sorry that I blew twenty training points on
it, but I'm glad the sharpening stones only ran me about half a gold
total.

I can't fucking believe this. I was so fixated on this newbie "find a
way to do it yourself" mode that I totally ignored a basic fact. 
There's nothing wrong with me selling off my bone chips and silks to
other players to finance my smithing. Why the fuck wouldn't I buy my
damn armor from another smith???

/bonk

Well, I'm off to try that, assuming I can find somebody near Sebilis who
has a master smithing skill and some time to kill to help out a newbie.
/em sighs, clearly disappointed in himself.
