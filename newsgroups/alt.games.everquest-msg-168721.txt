    Still reading it, looks pretty typical from how you described your
server.

    I used someone's link to look at your boards, to see that cleric you
said had more HPs than me. Most of your clerics without Magelos were towards
the bottom of the list, so I don't think it could have been them. The one
cleric I found that broke 3 K HPs was Elwren. Elwren also had an alternate
profile with two Aten loots in it (you have yet to kill Aten, correct?) that
was above my HP total. Could you have been looking at that profile by
mistake? He's got ND 3 on his regular profile, so that can't be the
difference, and I have over 300 HPs on him unbuffed so I don't think he
could catch up with extra STA from Brute/Boar.
