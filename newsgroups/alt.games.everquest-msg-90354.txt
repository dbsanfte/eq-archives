Well, last week when the clockwork dragon and Angry Gnome were wreaking
havoc in WW, they were DTing people.

A guildie was pretty incensed by it... he was running away from it, made no
attempt to hit it, got agrod then DT'd.  When I went to drag his body to
Zland rock (my guild was gonna kill the gnome/dragon) I got agrod also
(altho it was human controlled, it luckily ignored me when i FD'd)

It wouldnt let me get his body.. so somebody had to just sit dead for a long
ass time, while an unkillable GM was just dting random people. (he came and
agrod us a few mins later,DTing various people)

The mob its self was insane, Avatar snare (ae snare that Cazic has), Cazics
ae knockback, ae Silence (nothing can be casted), ae Ancient Breath (one of
the final nTov mobs), Lure of Ice (level 60 lure)

Dropped CoF, Tobrins eyepatch, and Lord Bobs ring.. not too shabby i guess.
The Angry Gnome dropped a CoF too (both were level 60)
