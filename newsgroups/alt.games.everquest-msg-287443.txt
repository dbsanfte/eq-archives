Private servers are run by fuckwits for even more inept fuckwits. What
idiot would want to devote time to playing a character on a server
that has a population of 10 players, and which could shut down at any
time?  Jeez, get a clue.

Oh, and you ARE ripping off Sony's code, which IS a copyright breach.
Let's just hope someone who applies to join your shitty server is a
member of SOE who then takes you to court. See if you can manage to
read the stuff below, then GTFO.


7. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, we hereby grant to you a
non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Software
solely in connection with playing the Game via an authorized and
fully-paid Account. You may not copy (except to make one necessary
back-up copy), distribute, sell, auction, rent, lease, loan, modify or
create derivative works, adapt, translate, perform, display,
sublicense or transfer all or any portion of the Software. You may not
copy any of the written materials accompanying the Software. You may
not reverse engineer, disassemble or decompile the Software except to
the extent that this restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable
law. The Software may contain license management software that
restricts your use of the Software.

8. We and our suppliers shall retain all rights, title and interest,
including, without limitation, ownership of all intellectual property
rights relating to or residing in the Disc, the Software and the Game,
all copies thereof, and all game character data in connection
therewith. You acknowledge and agree that you have not and will not
acquire or obtain any intellectual property or other rights, including
any right of exploitation, of any kind in or to the Disc, the Software
or the Game, including, without limitation, in any character(s),
item(s), coin(s) or other material or property, and that all such
property, material and items are exclusively owned by us.

9. You may not use any third party software to modify the Software to
change Game play. You may not create, facilitate, host, link to or
provide any other means through which the Game may be played by
others, such as through server emulators. You may not take any action
which imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our
infrastructure. You may not buy, sell or auction (or host or
facilitate the ability to allow others to buy, sell or auction) any
Game characters, items, coin or copyrighted material.

16. This Agreement is governed in all respects by the laws of the
State of California as such laws are applied to agreements entered
into and to be performed entirely within California between California
residents. The UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale
of Goods is expressly disclaimed. Both parties submit to personal
jurisdiction in California and further agree that any cause of action
relating to this Agreement shall be brought in the County of San
Diego, State of California (if under State law) or the Southern
District of California (if under federal law).
