I cant do it strictly like you want. For a raid you NEED several key factors
to come together. These needs can change depending on what you are fighting
. The vindicator for instance is a very high dammaging mob but that dammage
is limited to very few people. A dragon raid will have a great number of
people taking dammage constantly but at a low rate. Goreiane is best done by
casters since her breath weapon is a melee slowing dot while aaryonar is
best done by mostly melee since his breath weapon is mainly a mana sucking
dot.

Basic needs revolve around a group to do the dammage and a group to support
those doing the dammage. For doing dammage against mobs melee types are
best. For taking dammage warriors are best and at the high end only option.
For healing only clerics are capable of keeping up with main tank dammage.
Enchanters and shamans are force multipliers and enemy force minimiziers.

A good general purpose raid with 36 people would look sorta like this at
optimum.
6 clerics
6 support
24 dammage class

support includes shamans, enchanters , and magicians and necros for special
purposes and against certain targets even a single druid for debuffing.

dammage class includes everyone else with a minimum of several warriors. In
dammage class you prefer those classes that do this best . In other words
you never take a druid, magician, necro, a second pally, second sk etc. ,
when a better choice is available if your only interested in doing the most
with the least.

If you are asking what class to play to have the best shot at a place in a
raid I would list your best choices as .

1)cleric
2)warrior, monk , rogue
3)shaman , enchanter , wizard
4)ranger, sk , pally
