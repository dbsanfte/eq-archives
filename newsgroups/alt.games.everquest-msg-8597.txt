 It seems to vary, depending on what I'm unsure. Sometimes I've lost
three. Sometimes close to five blues. At 60 xp seems to not be that bad.
True, it's still many hours (at least 10) but overall it goes faster
than 59 and you since you're normally full xp most don't really care
about eating a death with no res..
