Not sure what, but as you said below, you must be doing something wrong.
We've opened a lot, and have not found Int caster chests to be rarer than
any other type.   1 / 3 chance.

We often have a rogue, druid and enchanter present, and we're never in time
trouble, so every chest we see gets opened.

Well, one random augment.   When you consider that 3/4 of the augments that
drop for us rot, thats not good odds.  HP ones are still liked, Stamina and
Mana get taken.    Nothing else seems to excite anyone, unless they have a
weakness in one of thier resists... disease for me.  Int / Wisdom, our
casters are all well over thier caps, even before KEI.   I think they get
shoved in the bank more than anything.

Illusion potions used to be common, about 1 in 3 chests, back when LDoN
first came out.  (Reactivated account and played the rogue for a couple
months then).

Since coming back to the game post LDoN cash nerf (I miss the days of 400pp
splits ;p)  the chest loot seems changed.    There are all new potions now,
but they're super common and all useless.    At least at level 65 normal.
Miraguls we've gotten 3 or so "Disease efficiency" potions.   Reduce mana
cost on disease DoT's by 30%.   (Effective on spells up to level 24.)
About 5 "Potion of Fortitude" potions, which were 1 hour str / stamina
buffs.  Some other various potions, the same kind of minor effects.   In the
same period, we've gotten a total of 3 augments, I believe.   Wisdom, Hit
points and a fire resist that rotted.

None of the gems or anything that we used to.

1/3, not 1 / 4.   From our experience, it seems that only one class type can
detect if it has no trap.   So it determines the class of chest first...
then does a second roll to determine if it's trapped or not.
