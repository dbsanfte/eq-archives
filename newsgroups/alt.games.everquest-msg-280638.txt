If the boardroom suits had invested more money in EQ1 to freshen up
EXISTING content, from the newbie zones on up, instead of desperately
bringing out expansions of questionable worth, they wouldn't have
wasted their money, time and effort on EQ2.  How they could make a
cock-up of EQ2 when they had YEARS of experience in game design just
makes me boggle.

The efforts they HAVE made to freshen EQ1's existing content have been
risible - for instance, no-one really cares Firiona Vie changed hands
or that the Trolls supposedly took their old home city back - big
yawns all 'round.  Now, if PLAYERS had the capacity to influence which
race owned which zone, by taking part in some sort of "Zone Wars"
events, that would make things a bit more exciting.  

As it is, there's a bit of waffle to be heard in certain zones,
supposedly from gods or demigods squaring up to each other, a few new
NPC's about for a couple of days, then the "Big Change".  Boring in
the extreme.  In connection with that, does anyone bother reading the
Journal?  I pity whoever has to waste their time writing it up,
because no-one I know (including myself) gives a toss.

Mind you, with PoK now the "Universal Metropolis" who really needs
home cities?  For example, the only gripes aired when the froggies
were moved to Rathe Mountains was that people thought the Hill Giants
had gone for good and whined about it ad nauseum - I've not heard a
single Froglok in /ooc say they are annoyed over being kicked out, or
a single Troll gloat over having the old swamp back  :D
