Technically, yes, but in reality, no unless someone tells Verant.

I played on a friends account for about 2 months off and on back when I
started playing, only problem is that I got one of his alts killed in Gfay
who was bound in Everfrost, lost THAT corpse, but I made more back, and then
HE lost the corpse, lol, bye bye level 7.  But he did get a bunch of level
5-10s on another server and 5 levels on his paladin and 7 on his druid. (and
about 200pp, an assload of GLS and a pair of totemic leggings, and various
crap equip on both characters)

Then again, not everyone is as blaisely nice-guy as me  =P, I could've run
off with his level 23 warrior with Royal Velium Arms, Legs, Boots and
Gloves. (although I did get him impaled on a darkweed snake and kodiak once
at level 18)
