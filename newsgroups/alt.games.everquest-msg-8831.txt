37 Ranger, Mine looks like this :

1) Stinging Swarm
2) Snare
3) Grasping Roots 
4) Firefist or Shield of Thistles (depending on situation)
5) Optional Buff
6) Optional Buff
7) SoW
8) Lesser Heal (gawd is this starting to suck)

I solo about 80% of the time, so i swap strength, cat, skin, and
barbcoat as needed. I keep SoW up all the time, just in case, and to SoW
others.

I think I did not effectivly use Stinging Swarm till about 34, I started
out just leaving Ignite in slot #1, but crap swarm does much more
damage. I worked with Dance of the Fireflies too, waiting on the boat,
standing in front of the PoD, etc. Finally, I just got sick of swarm not
working and put DotF in slot #1 and told myself it would stay there until
my conjur was good enough to use swarm. Once swarm started working
somewhat reliably, (somewhere over 110), I began using it all the time
to pull.

Sometimes I put Firefist in slot #5.

I did not always mem Snare and Grasping Roots, just drifted into the
habit of having them both up.
