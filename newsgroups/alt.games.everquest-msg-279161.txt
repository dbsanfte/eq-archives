Never, since it's not a bug.   =P

Just like you can only get exp across a certain (arbitrary) range, LDoNs
were designed to only accept a certain (arbitrary) range of levels.  DoN is
a 10-level spread, LDoN is a 7-level spread, raw grinding is up to a
~25-level spread (haven't bothered to check how far down I can group from
70, but somewhere around there).
