From the above description it sounds like either the RAID controller,
or several HDDs failed at once.

If Verant is running continuous backups of their servers, nothing
would be lost. If they are running periodic backups (for example every
4 hours), then you would see some roll-back.

Looks to me like VI did a great job addressing a major hardware
failure, and the only loss was in up time and not data.

WTG! Verant Server Team!!
