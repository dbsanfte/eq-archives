Yeah, you're right.  My bad.

Last post I saw on it said:
"Ive seen it work some recently, but ive never successfully cast even
when it works, i always still get inturrupted heh..."
That's almost a month old, the absense of further complaints suggests
that it's probably working as advertised now.  Sorry about going off
half-cocked there, no doubt you're all terribly disappointed in me
over that *cough* uncharacteristic *cough* lapse.
