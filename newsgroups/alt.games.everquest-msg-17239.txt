i was shocked when  noticed the spell costs, the first lvl ones
are okey and lvl 4 around 4gp, but then the lvl 8 spells cost 4pp
woo nice jump in price, will it be cheaper later on to try to research
spells? my necro gain that at lvl 16 about 4 bubles from now, and i
have found words of dissolution as a loot, but i guess that the
failure rate is big to.
