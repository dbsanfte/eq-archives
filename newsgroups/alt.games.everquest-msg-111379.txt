Seek help.

Every official count showed Bush the winner.  Every independent
recount since then has showed Bush the winner.

The only person who tried to steal the election was Gore,
via attempts to get selective recounts in districts where
he was favored, where any "ballot recovery" of poorly
marked cards would gain him more votes than his opponent.
And let's not forget how he tried to disenfranchise
thousands of our military men by having their votes
simply thrown in the trash can.

Bush won, fair and square, despite Gore's attempts to
stage a coup d'etat.  Deal with it.

Stop listening to morons like Michael Moore, who don't
let facts get in the way of their obsessive partisanship.
Give up the myths of the wacky left and come visit
reality.
