Yep... Compaq=Gateway=Dell= Trash (at least for a home user) :)

If you are local enough that I might ever actually meet you and you want 
a system I'll recommend any of half a dozen small systems builders 
within driving distance.

If you aren't local, ask a local nerd.

EQ doesn't push the limits of 3d gaming. The engine is far too simple 
for that. It does push the raw geometry processing power a bit (because 
500 characters in the vicinity of the bazaaris pretty geometry 
intensive...so an older fast card is better than a new entry level card 
that supports all the newest directx features but can't do the raw 
framerate. This is why a gf4ti4600 is better for eq than an fx5200 
despite the 5200 being newer and supporting more directx features.
