Yes as friends come and go twinking helps if you want to play a new class or
check it out.
I find it takes to at least 20 to see what a race/class is like.

OTH..My son, who has played almost as long as I have. has done the same
until recently.
2 of his high school buddies just bought the game so the trio started off as
brand new noobs.
I did give them a few level 10ish trinkets and was going to port them. They
were all waiting at the docks in EF at the time planning to go kill sisters.
I was going to port them to SRO.
I couldn't figure out what was taking so long for them to decide what they
were doing.

The 2 noobs wanted to take the boat. They never had a boat ride before. I
think my son is having a hoot. No one knows what hotkeys are. How to pull
assist etc.

Fun is wherever you decide to find it.
