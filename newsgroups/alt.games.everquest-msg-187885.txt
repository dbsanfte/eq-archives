Not to hijack but....Having both cleric and shaman you are way off.
They are no where near a cleric for healing power, or HP/AC buffs.
Druids are closer by a hair. Take rez out of the game and clerics
still retain a high degree of desirabilty. Its always best to avoid
the reason for rezes in the first place.

Now if the fight is over you are owed nothing. Its that simple, unless
of course you send me the money to pay for my account then you have a
point.
