Hmmm.  I do a LOT of LDONs.  I *might* be willing to try a LDON with no cleric,
no warrior type, no crowd control, and my ranger as the MT.  *IF* I knew
everyone in the group very well and could count on their gear being up to par
and that they would be at their keyboard the whole time and know how to play
their characters correctly and if there was a wizard or druid to evacuate us. 
In a pickup group you can't count on any of those things though.
It's more likely though that we'd just fill the empty position.  My friends
play for fun, not frustration.


Healea Sternstar - 58 cleric
Skila Windrunner - 57 ranger
Jennaii - 45 druid
Linni - 31 shaman
Stormfoot - 31 warrior
