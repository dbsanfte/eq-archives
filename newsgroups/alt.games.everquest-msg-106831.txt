Thurg gate potion... somebody mentioned cost - this is free

Well it's nice but not really essential.. when im running through WW to nToV
(usually with 3-10 mobs chasing me) its a lot nicer to have lev, and just
run straight off the canyon down to ToV (rather then stopping, and  making
sure as you fall you hit the wall at times as to not 10k)

>  Harmony - Who needs harmony? FD split works indoors; unlike Harmony

If its breaking an outdoor camp (rather then agro mobs wandering about)
Harmony is a lot easier.. you don't need to worry about splitting add's, cuz
they just won't come.. of course as I spend all my life in a dungeon, thats
not an option

>  Snare - I kill them fast enough that snare normally doesn't matter.

lol rubbish.  if you get a SoW'd mob in Seb and your soloing (seens as this
thread seems to be refering to solo), you can be pretty sure that mob is
going to run and cause adds.  In HS that could mean your gonna eat several
HT's..   those wyverns I've been killing in SS are real damn fast (and as
you know, the wurms have the same silly warping issues)..  at best you will
just get a few wyvern adds (not really a problem unless you were really low
on HP) but if your unlucky, it will run straight into the paladin wurm and
get LoH/Heals

We can't solo kill several mobs at once...
We can't solo kill any mobs without "personal cost"... a druid can use *mana
free* right click nukes, dots, snares and root
We can't travel..
We can't solo dragons..  pos monk class !!
