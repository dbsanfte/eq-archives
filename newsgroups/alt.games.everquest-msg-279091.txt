I know of a trick that gets you 2.5k per hour and it's fully legal!  A
good group, even 2 boxing tank (especially SK for snare pull and FD
spilt if needed) and a shammy for slow/heals in PoJ basement.  Then
dump any diamond and blue diamond you collect in the barter for 300 a
pop.

The only drawback is after a few days or so, you'll get swamped by
ethereal parchment.  I had a spell mule created for my guild to hold
all the spells (parchment were no drop) and he's already carrying 180
or so assorted 61 and 62 spells.
