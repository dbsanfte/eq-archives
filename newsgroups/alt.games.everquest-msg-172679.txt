Had two parts here I just *had* to comment on ...

>>SNIP RAMBLING<<

>>> Incidentally, I previously predicted before a few people while in a
mental hospital that the end of the "world" would occur in 2004. So that
must mean that I am a prophet of God, as a true prophet of God is 100%
accurate. <<<

While it's correct that a true prophet of God is 100% accurate, we won't
know if you are 100% accurate until 2004, now will we?

>>SNIP AGAIN<<

>>> I believe I just did something that you would normally need a doctorate
for, cultural change based on introduction of a new technology, namely the
female breast. <<<

Since when is the female breast "new technology"?
