A mid-level (30 - 55) Paladin is best at fighting casters and undead.
But a Ranger is gonna make a much better partner for a Cleric against
anything else, and as good as the Paladin against most undead. At high
levels Paladin is better against undead than any other class, except
maybe Necro.  A Necro with the 50% undead slow (L39?) paired with a
Paladin is the undead's worst nightmare, they make a horribly twisted
and frighteningly effective duo.  And additional Paladins stack, which
makes opportunities for some way over-the-top parody of traditional
RPing (think "Army of Darkness" and go downhill from there), as the
Puppettins force the mobs to dance to the tune of the Necromaster.
