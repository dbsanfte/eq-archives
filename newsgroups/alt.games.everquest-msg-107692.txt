Well I could have been 60 by now, but I took up tailoring instead.
In retrospect 60 would have been easier to achieve. =)

Here are mine
52 monk(my favorite, I love to be the puller), 51 druid(master of 5 trade skills),
52 necro(solo only), 42 Mage, 26 gnome chanter(120 tinkering),
16 shaman(going to do alchemy), 15 cleric.

Thinking of getting a 2nd account, I want to start a rogue to, and maybe a beast lord.
Of course halfling rangers look good, and a gnome paladin would just be too fun.
/sigh so many choices. =)

I keep starting new characters because I get so sour on the high-level game.
I really like the 15-40 range.

None have their epics yet, might do the monk one. I think I will probably
get my monk to 60 eventually. Since the spellbook has gone I finally started
playing my other caster characters again.
