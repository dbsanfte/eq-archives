    Your server must have been slacking, then. Our Lake Rathe / RM zone
tunnel was clogged with corpses, with more being dragged there every minute.
If you ain't dyin', you ain't tryin'!

    I got lucky. I'd logged on my level 24 shaman to look at the new mobs
before going to a memorial in the Arena (RL car accident, very tragic, he'll
be missed). Saw the Blood Reaver, didn't think that the people pulling
bodies would be stupid enough to get near the mob with Vox's abilities.... I
ate one 500 point breath weapon, got feared, and somehow he didn't breathe
again until I'd recovered from fear and run to zone. Thank goodness for SoW.

>creatures.

    What few horses appear in the game look really neat. Too bad they're
quite rare - I think horses or similar critters (unicorn, pegasus) are found
in Sky, Fear, Lavastorm, LFay, and SK.

    Lag from all the people in the zone. It was really bad in EK - you could
NOT see people until you were within melee range of them, which meant the KS
accusations were many and loud. Not that they could be heard over all the
people shouting for items - imagine a zone with 250 people, half of them
beggars, and you have East Karana on Quellious on the weekend.

    Ooh, cleric ports. 8)

    From what I hear the RM event was geared to level 40's, which explains
why the Blood Reaver was put in the zone. Er, never mind.

>The loot was total crap.

    Check Allakhazam's for a recap of everything that dropped. In EK the
drops my group of level 30's (30 WAR, 30 SHM, 32 ENCH) found useful were the
INT-caster cloak, the INT-caster bracer, the WIS-caster belt, and the WAR
neckpiece. Most of the items were low AC, so they were junky. Looks like VI
has upped the standards for hidden slot gear, though - the belts and cloaks
were fairly nice.

>mobs there we'd never seen before.

    I got to see three events - EK, RM, NRo. In North Ro, 60-odd folks were
running around killing anything that moved and yelling to destroy ALL fungus
plz. My 41 WAR killed a few things on her way through - only thing that
stands out in my memory was the one mob with the Monty Python and the Holy
Grail quote. (When attacked, it gave the line about "This is supposed to be
a happy occasion!")

    I didn't take a /who count in Rathe Mountains, as my 24 SHM was just
trying to get out alive. I'd had the hope that maybe the WIS caster earring
and belt might drop near zone, or that something in my level range might be
around, but Blood Reaver quickly convinced me to scram. This zone had the
least amount of "need items for my class plz!" spam, and the high levels
were trying to mount an attack on the dragon to clear it out.

    East Karana was a zoo. 250 people prime time, down to 200 by dinnertime
PST. Non-stop spam that could not be turned off if you wanted to keep on top
of the train reports. Highest level non-nameds looked to be level 35ish
spectres, loot was dropping a lot, lag was mind-numbing. Came away with an
INT bracer and cloak for my 32 ENCH, and an INT ring for the bank. The named
mob was apparently perma-camped by a group of 60's that had been there for
12 hours.

    Was it fun? Judging from all the people there, it would seem so. I got
some neat toys, the mobs seemed well thought-out, only cruddy thing was the
other players. The loot was well done, too - many weak pieces, but some nice
ones and the Lore No Drop meant people would call out drops they couldn't
use. Hopefully more things like this (on a smaller scale) will be seen in
the future.
