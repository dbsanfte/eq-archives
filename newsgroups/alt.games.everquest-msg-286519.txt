Well, this patch was an odd one, because it was announced at the last 
minute on the boards.  However, I still managed to provide plenty of 
warning to my guild mates that it was due.

Previous patches have been more clearly advertised on the boards and 
I've usually provided around 5-10 days notice to my guild mates of the 
impending patch.
