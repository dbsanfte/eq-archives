1)    Hello again, Mark.  Hear, hear!  (When Daimler bought Chrysler). Thaks
for reminding us that we are for Merc, not madness.


2)    "...When Adam and Eve ate the fruit, 'God' basically punished man
kind for their new-found intelligence. And damn, does your god hold a
grudge...."
Is this from Kenny Boles?  Whatever, that seems to be a very Christian
notion (about God bearing a grudge).  Other faiths don't think so, even
though Adam ate a forbidden fruit.
