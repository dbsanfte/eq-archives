Would this work?
*When* does the difficulty level for the quest get set?  When you *get* the
quest or when you enter the dungeon?
Can anyone join your group after you get the quest?  Could someone join your
group and then just not enter the dungeon?
What if you were in a group and *had* to log off for some reaon while in the
dungeon?  Is there a way to beam out?
