If you're level 3 or 4, and can't survive against a bat solo long enough to
kill it with 3 / 19 weapons....

Hell, I was doing it with 3 damage 22? delay weapons and scattered bits of
patchwork armor.  Had to use rusty daggers, since I couldn't afford fine

Who needs to group at level 3 or 4?  And I find the idea of being carried by
a newbie group killing bats and orcs to be pretty amusing.
