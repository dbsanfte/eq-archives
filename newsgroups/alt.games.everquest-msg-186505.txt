If you are going to quote me, use the full context.

"The whole point of playing EQ is to advance at something, and all
advancement in EQ is "numerical" (tradeskill skill-ups, class
skill-ups, levels, bank account, number of people on your friends
list, filling out your spellbook with research only spells, etc)"

In context my point is obvious. 

Nobody plays EQ (or any other game) for the sheer joy of staring at
the screen. Which is EXACTLY what the old travel model and book-med
force(d) players to do.  Anything that gets in the way of "advancing"
(even if one persons idea of advancing is to sit and chat for hours on
end) detracts from the play experience.

If your idea of winning points in a debate consists on taking lines
out of context, there is no further point in continuing to exchange
posts with you.
