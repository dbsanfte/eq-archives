Was in a group in Velks US recently , me (chanter56) Pally50something,
Ranger52  monk51 and an SK54. As long as adds were mezed and all slowed it
was easy. Pally now and then threw out a heal.

nother time same spot had a cleric in grp, he was from  some uba guild with
a silly hammer who got bored cos no one was getitng hurt, so waded in with
his hammer. Did a good deal of damage. Whats the problem, with this?
Ofcourse when he need to play the healing cleric he did, usually to heal my
sorry arse when mobs decided it was resistathon time on the mezes. Just that
it didnt happen often.

I dont see why cleric should always be sitting on their arses cos someone
thinks thats what they should be doing all the time.
