Heh, conversely, I've been an American all my life, but I use British 
spellings probably 70% of the time...  colour and favour sound closer to 
the spoken word to me, at least the way I speak it.  Armour and 
'standardised', though, don't. :)  But how close is 'plz' to the spoken 
word?  Looks more like you're blowing me a raspberry than being polite.

That said, I'll still buff nearly everybody that asks, assuming I have the 
mana.  I've noticed this funny thing... If you buff stupid people who 
annoy you, odds are very high that some switch in their head flips to 
"Ooh! I'm buffed and uber! I can take that red no problem!"  And 5 minutes 
later you hear

A_dweeb shouts, "Can ne1 help find my corpse plz?"

Sometimes, if I'm feeling particularly vicious, I'll find their corpse for 
them just so I can buff them again. :)

Yeah, I know, passive aggressive.  So what?
