>>>SNIP<<<

Maybe the wording somewhere is wrong, but I don't think they are adding a
new server as in a <insert unused gods name> server. Sounds more like they
are adding an office in Europe, and will have a server that is closer to
Europe than California is (thats where the main office is, right?)

My question would be: will English GMs be more forgiving then American GMs?
Or will they prove to be useless as well?
