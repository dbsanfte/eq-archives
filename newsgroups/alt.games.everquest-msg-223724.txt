You assume that the widget is something that everyone knew of and was
supposed to have.  See below.

For the sake of argument, the widget is a piece of spyware that the user
downloaded because they (rather stupidly) clicked something on a pop-up that
came off of a web site they hit (Allakhazam or EQAtlas, perhaps).  How,
exactly, is a programmer supposed to take that into account?  And what,
exactly, is going to happen if you "bitch to the widget maker" for a piece
of spyware the user got from a pop-up?

And if you're going to start accounting for it, how about the various other
spyware widgets out there?  Are you realistically saying that SOE should
account for every possible piece of shareware/freeware/spyware/scumware that
one of their end users could possibly download?

If you take the time to account for it, you're a better man/woman than I am.
AFAIC, if you download that crap, it's on you.  I'm not accounting for it.
If it blows up my code, I'll tell you to unload it (or tell your management
to unload it for you).

I have the luxury of being in a controlled environment which allows me to
make such heavy handed demands.  SOE does not have that luxury.

The majority of what bothers you personally may be the broken quests and the
like.  Point noted, and I agree (and believe I agreed in an earlier post)
that sort of thing is on them to fix and test.

However, the laundry list of things over the years that were hardware
related (things like being on for five minutes and going LD due to an
incompatibility with Linksys routers, or the issue about a year ago that
kept users on AMD machines out but let users with Intel chips in, for
example) ... well, those were hardware issues.  And they didn't have a clue
what they were until they were reported, either as a bug report or on the
tech support board.

They didn't know they needed to test for it until the examples popped up and
the need displayed itself.  To give them credit I haven't heard of this sort
of incompatibilty in a while, so it's possible that they have altered their
testing scheme to account for things like overclocked AMD chips.

But that's not to say that something similar couldn't happen with the next
patch.
