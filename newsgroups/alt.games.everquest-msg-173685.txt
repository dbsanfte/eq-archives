There are ulthork man-o-wars in the SW section of the zone (south of Kael
entrance, west of Icefang) that are level 40-42 and rarely drop the tusks,
although supposedly more than other types of ulthorks.  They will start
turning light blue at 55.  You'll run out of them eventually, so kill
walruses to get more of them to spawn.
