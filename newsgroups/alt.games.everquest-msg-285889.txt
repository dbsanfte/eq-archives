I linked the quest in another post in this thread.  Keep in mind that
some of those mobs are unsnareable.  Solo by a necro would be fairly
difficult.  But try out Valor.  If no one is around the cave area
(from zone in, run down the wall to the left until you find water and
a cave on the far side) you can get some pretty nice experience there
at level 60.  Those fiends don't summon.  Alternatively, it is
possible to kite the geonid-shaped golems.  You just dont have nearly
as much room to work with.  For them run the other direction from the
grave yard.  Then run down the waterline (stay low by the water) until
you see a building.  Inside is a stairway to a bridge that leads to
the golem area.  Watch out for spiders there, many cannot be snared.
Golems can always be snared as I recall.
