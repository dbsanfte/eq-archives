Take a deep breath.

Iksar models and the items/spells that dropped with the Kunark
expansion, and skills/levels/abilities post 50 were ALREADY ON YOUR
MACHINE (through the online patcher). Unless players bought the
expansion they could not access the features. (EXACTLY LIKE THE NEW
RAID CHANNEL)

The "new" non-windowed UI that came with the Velious expansion was
ALREADY ON YOUR MACHINE (through the online patcher). It could not be
activated unless you bought the expansion (EXACTLY LIKE THE NEW RAID
CHANNEL)

The Bazaar/Trader functions are ALREADY ON YOUR MACHINE and everyone
elses even if they do not own luclin. Obviously you cannot use the
functions/zones unless you buy the expansion.

Apples and oranges. Content changes and additions between expansions
have always been "free" (payed for through the monthly subscription).

There are two ways that EQ evolves. The first is through the patching
process that benefits all players (regardless of which expansions they
do or do not own). This process goes on between and in spite of
expansions. The second is through expansions, which have ALWAYS
contained features that were unavailable unless you bought the
expansion.

You really need to give that knee a rest. All the jerking can't be
good for your joints. The fact is that Sony/Verant has ALWAYS
bribed/extorted/enticed players to buy EQ expansions with content
and/or features. This fact is NOT new with PoP, and my pointing it out
is NOT ass kissing.

I personally think that the new raid system should be available to
everyone, but that doesn't change the facts stated above.
