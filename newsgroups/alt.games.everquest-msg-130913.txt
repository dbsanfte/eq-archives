Every time I start to play I have the Mouse cursor (arrow) exactly in the
middle of my screen.  I always have to change the display properties to
800x600 then when that window comes up, I have to change the display
properties back to 640x480 ??? which will eliminate the cursor.  I use
640x480 account of my eye site.  I have been told there is a solution for
this.  Many TIA for any and all suggestions.
