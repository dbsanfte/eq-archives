I'm not sure why huge HPs affects the question of Wis vs Mana, but
in any case at your level you shouldn't be grouping with players who
can't be completely healed by CH.  (CH heals 7500 HPs.)

In any case, wisdom basically adds to your mana; the amount it adds
depends on your level, though, so higher wisdom becomes more useful
at higher levels.  Wisdom isn't that hard to get from gear, though,
so if you work at it you'll find your wisdom is 255, which is as high
as it can get for a while, and then you just want +mana items because
more wisdom doesn't help.

Mana regen helps also, both from items and from buffs.  It's not as
important as it used to be because the new "out of combat" resting
lets you regen mana quickly, but mana regen items/buffs will help you
last longer before running out of mana in a tough fight, and will let
you avoid having to wait for out-of-combat rest mode as often.
