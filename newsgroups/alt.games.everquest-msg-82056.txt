95% of all exp groups need melee types

100% of exp need healers

If an exp group wants a Nuker, they can choose from Druid
(Nuker/Healer/SoWer/Porter), Shaman (Healer/SoWer/DoTer/Slower),
Cleric (Healer/Nuker/Stunner), or Mage (Pet Tank/Nuker/Summoner)

Wizard (Nuker/Porter) will ALWAYS have a hard time getting into a
pick-up group, when any one of the above classes is availabe instead.

It is an attitude based on the facts. Thus "many" people as you have
noted think like I do.

You have obviously not played EQ for very long. What you have
described above is exactly how the games is played from level 16-60.

AE combat is not available to Wizards until the mid-later levels.

AE combat is suicide unless you have 3+ Wizards unloading and sharing
agro. Any Wizard or mage that AE's in a group that is "fighting one
mob at a time, mezzing extras, with damage coming from melee, while
clerics sit on their ass and heal" is going to die at mid-high levels
no ifs, ands, or butts.

I am getting the impression that you have not played EQ for very long,
and do not have a character in the upper levels.
