Hmm well actually I believe it does change, but it depends on the type of
dispell they cast, or possibly more to do with the era.

For example, any mob that AOE dispells in my experience will take from the
top slot down.  Dragons in HoT are an example of this (Dozekar).

Any mob that actually casts SINGLE dispell on you, will remove a random
buff.  Frogs in Old Sebilis are an example of this.

Some of the newer AOE dispells may be random also.
