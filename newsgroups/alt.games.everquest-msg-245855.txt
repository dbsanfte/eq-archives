 The problem with a shaman/Paladin duo is that you don't have any way
to pull singles at lvl 65 so you're limited in your potential hunting
spots. Of course if you do screw up, you can rez so I don't really
know which duo is more powerful. 

  I prefer an SK because we can hunt in more spots with a feign puller
than without but either works very well with a shaman.
