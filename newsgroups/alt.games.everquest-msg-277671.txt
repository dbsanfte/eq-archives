Sorry I beg to differ, the combat system is still all over the place with 
endless fixes that help one class then nerf another. They stopped fighters 
getting insane agility and becoming invincible only to nerf the hell out of 
scouts at the same time.

The longer I play the game the more obvious it becomes that the game is 
lacking spirit and a vision. All the quests seem so bland, where's the sense 
of adventure? Dont get me started on the carpenter issue!

I am personally holding out until I hear what the expansion holds in store, 
if it's simply more of the same then i'm out.
