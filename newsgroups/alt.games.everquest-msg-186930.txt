It's "popular enough to matter" if it's instantly recognizeable by the
majority of players. Kermit most definately, without a doubt is.
You're getting desperate, give it the fuck up. If you asked 5 GMs if
"Kermit" was against the naming policy, I guarantee you that every
single one of them would say "yes". If you asked the entire GM staff,
I can make you the exact same promise. There is no "gray area" on this
one, no matter how you try to twist, loophole, and nitpick. Kermit and
the million altered spellings that Froglok players have taken on are
against the naming policy, end of discussion.
