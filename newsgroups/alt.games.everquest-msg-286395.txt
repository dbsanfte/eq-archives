 - To help balance the way healing items work from class to class,
healing-based AAs no longer work on heals cast from items.  Items that
cast healing spells that are not castable by normal players and were
previously affected by healing AAs have had their healing amount
increased accordingly.

    Is this a Lifetap nerf?

We specifically changed the items that are no longer focuseable to
heal for more. This will be a net increase in healing for players who
didn't have the AAs that let them focus/crit the potions.
