A healer who let me sit low health for any amount of time wouldn't
group with me again, because healing while medding will get a magician
killed.

Simple fact - adds home in on sitting magicians over any other sitting
caster.  Other simple fact - a magician who has 950ish hp and 550 ac
(1400 hp with PotC on) gets hit for full damage almost always - and 
can't take more than a few seconds of being beat on from the mobs we 
hunt (that hit for 140+).  

If I'm sitting when an add shows up I *WILL* take several hundred hp
in damage before anyone can even react - If I'm already down several
hundred hp, I could (and have) died before I can get a heal.
