 Shaman is actually a pretty good dueller. With their debuffs, dots,
slows, roots... Well.  Let's just say you should come prepared if you'll
be duelling one.  Enchanter can lower your resists pretty good as well I
think. Out of those three I'd probably put Necro at the bottom and
Shaman at the top.

 I don't do a lot of duels so others probably have a more educated
opinion.
