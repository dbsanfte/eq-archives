really don't need to spend quite that much just yet, wait until you get to
40+ then go and get the gear for him/her.

I would only spend about 4k.. go get acrylia studded tunic, cloak, and maybe
mask.  Your chest and legs look fine for now.  rings= plat. rings with the
6wis. boots=GEBS...that should be all for now..

That should do you just fine for a while, then if you really want to twink
him out, go for Elysians gear, maybe get someone to hunt them for you
(druids solo them at 50 or so plus) or get a group.  Or if you really wish,
you can MQ some of the velious armor.  Take a look at my link, I'm not uber
or anything but I have some decent gear=)

Have fun, I love my druid and hope you will too=)
