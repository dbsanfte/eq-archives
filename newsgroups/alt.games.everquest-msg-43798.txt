Some of them are pretty bad, but then so are some of the
nay-sayers.  On the other hand, there are several people
who post there who seem able to talk more objectively about
the game.  It takes a while to figure out who they are, but
then you know who's names to look for to actually gain an
understanding of what the game is like, and whether it's
worth $40 to try it for a month.
