If they have, then they have made a bad decisions.

Sony's CS is woeful. Anyone who has dealt with any half way decent CS
recognises this, but there are three issues you are confusing.

1st point: Not playing on the test server does not preclude you from
having an opinion of SOE's testing. If problems are slipping through the
test server, then SOE obviously is either not testing for long enough or
doesn't have enough people using the test server. Both are problems that
SOE has to solve. People are paying customers who are paying for a
finished product.

2nd Point: discussion of the minutiae of the game should be seen as very
healthy by SOE. It shows that people are interested. Bit like academics
who endlessly discuss books, movies, etc, where as most of us just want
to play/read/do. Except for sport? where it is the other way around.

3rd point: don't confuse the people who do, as you say, winge about
anything, with those above.

4th point: SOE's CS is bloody awful. From their helpdesk attitude of
blame the customer, through to their obvious attitude of customers as
cash cows. That stupid "the login server is currently congested message"
when they asre patching is a clear example. It really is a basic
no-brainer to modify the login program to have a variety of different
messages.

Something like 
	"Server patching is now in progress.
	 We expect servers to be available 
	      in 2 hours 35 minutes".
would generate a lot of positive feeling towards SOE by customers.

A simple change that shows that SOE wants to keep customers informed.


I agree that there are some people who do winge, but usually they stand
out like dog's balls in the games and most people avoid them as such.
