    Anything that does damage or debuffs a mob seems to be suspect. In my
example, I'm turning mobs with a 12 point DD spell. I doubt that damage
alone would turn them around.

    I find the amount that STR helps is proportional to the ATK increase.
Since a 60 point STR buff doesn't increase ATK by 60, it's weaker than a 60
point ATK buff. But I can still see a visible movement of my high and modal
backstabs when I get a STR buff. It's also MUCH easier to find STR gear, as
opposed to gear that directly buffs ATK.

    I don't believe in this. My job is to stay behind mobs and blend them
into a fine mist. I have a tool for that - Evade can keep me at the mob's
back, beneath others on the hate list. I do NOT have a tool to keep a caster
from going above other tanks on the hate list without myself going above the
other tanks, so that is not my job. That having been said, I usually will
NOT Evade right after a caster has done something that would have them at
the top of the hate list were I not there already, like slowing or healing,
because then I know the mob will beeline them. But that's the only time I
care what others are doing. Each class has to manage their own aggro.
