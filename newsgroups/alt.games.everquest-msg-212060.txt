/disc whirlwind

Yeah, I can touch 9k dps in the right situations.

I then proceed to die 10 seconds later...

Spend 15k on a (guessing at the reduction) 47/44, or spend 2k on a 35/35.  I
know which is the better deal if you are price conscious.

If you aren't price conscious, again, there's better options than Windblade.

And with the 1h weapons available to rangers at ridiculously cheap prices
these days, and the reduced damage bonus on Windblade for his level (the big
selling point of the "beefy" 2h'ers is big hits generally), 1h really is
probably the best option for such a ranger.

Windblade isn't a "bad" weapon.  Not at all.  Just not the best choice,
almost no matter what your intentions are.
