Nope, I'm using the best equipment available to me, Epic or Tranq.  So
far our guild has had one superior monk weapon (drop off Gozzrem) and
one "equivalent with stats" weapon off Rhag 1 (although with the higher
post 60 damage bonus its worse).  My haste is 36% - so far none of our
guild has 41% haste other than Rogues and Rangers.  My Self Spell Haste
is 40% - from epic.  Every Ranger in our guild has 50% Self Spell Haste.

That is why Rangers do more damage than me.  There is simply no
availability of weapons for non-uberguild monks while there are lots and
lots of upgrades for Rangers in both Luclin and PoP.  So far there is
NOTHING in PoP for monks - no equipment, no weapons, no nothing.
