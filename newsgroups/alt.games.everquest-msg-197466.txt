Make sure when you're looking for a bard necro sk, that you mention
you're new to the game. Its not been unknown for me to run all over a
zone to find someones corpse if I think they really need help. And at
63 nothing in gfay is gonna aggro me. And anyone can drag your corpse
if they run across it.
