I recall the debate here about it.  Hughes tried to explain how a druids
were the worst soloing class in existance.  Celano, for her part, just
wanted a small tweak, specifically the removal of the 10% penalty.  True to
her word, she seems happy with that.  I know Precia will love the removal of
the penalty, since she's mainly a soloing Paladin... now I just have to get
T-boots so I can stand to play her (Tenjou's Selo spoiled me).

OTOH, it would force them to come up with some sort of plan, instead of
stabbing in the dark, every time they add something to the game.  A little
bit of accountablility for Verant may not be such a bad thing.  If they're
worried about being held to the concept guide, then that may be indicative
of a problem on their part, and an inability to focus on a concept.
