Paladins are effective tanks too, we just don't have any 60s that play
that much.  Our one 60 pally was our designated off-tanker on quite a
few raids before he cut back his playtime.  It's not the lack of a
MoSS quality weapon as much as the lack of whatever the named Kobold
in the pit drops.  That thing is 19/24 I think, and I've seen several
rot.  No drop, so you have to be there, but that's about as good a
weapon as you're ever gonna see off something level 56ish.  Our pallys
were using the great big 2hp for a while, but we're down to one
active, and he uses 1hs and a shield.
I am damn impressed with our new Erudite SK though.  He tanks
basically as well as our 60 Ogre SK, and he has been basically
unguilded until now.  Nicest gear I've seen on an unguilded person,
but grouping with him before he joined it was easy to see why he was
able to get that gear.  There is a huge difference between a
well-played tank and an average tank.  Just waiting for him to make 60
so that he can be our main puller now, monks are getting worried.
