I just thought about this..The legends server is a way to test high end
toons on up coming high end levels.Evidently the Jagged Pine zone is 25 to
?(they say its low to mid range but I have heard otherwise).The test
server(I'm guessing)has only low to middle level toons on it.,as no one with
there right mind would grow a toon to high level on this server.I could be
wrong and probably am.But any way ..most people with other things to do
don't have the time to spend on a throw away toon.So my point is ...I
guess... let the rich boys play while we will reap the rewards of a no
glitch zone.....hopefully.
