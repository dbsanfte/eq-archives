You sir, are an idiot, if you cannot see the fact that Disk space, no matter
HOW cheap,  is still a finite resource. Sure, they can keep characters and
the associated data around for ever, but why should they ?  As has already
been explained to you ( probably in words to large for you to comprehend  )
it makes no financial sense for a company to expend resources, even if its
just disk space, if that resource is not paying for its self.

The original Apartment analogy was spot on in its accuracy.  If  you dont
pay the rent, then theres no incentive for the company ( Verant in this
case ) to continue to maintain your data. Why should ANY company that wants
to stay in business use ANY resource no matter how small for a non-paying
consumer ? Such a company that applies such business practices is one that
is doomed to failure.  Veran, apparently, wants to continue to stay in
business.
