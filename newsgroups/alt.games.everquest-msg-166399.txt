multiple times...

Actually someone did that to ME the other day because I had undercut him
(Stein of moggok for 350.. used to sell them for 150 in EC Tunnel, he had
one for 500)... managed to get my machine that can run past the bank in the
bazaar with a dip to around 25 fps (it's completely stripped to the bone
graphics wise, running 800x600 with a smaller viewport) to go lag dead due
to all the crud on my screen... he wasn't on half an hour later though... I
think he knocked about 100 people offline.
