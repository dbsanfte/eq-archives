I like grouping with a certain rogue (Im a 60 monk) when im expin in
somewhere like Velks or FG.

Solo I can handle 5/6 or so spiders in 1 go (well solo with a cleric bot)...
and solo (well with his cleric bot) he can handle 4 with chaotic backstab (3
was his max before), but together, well our biggest so far is a 12 mob pull.

It helps with an extra person too, when something pops they can leap onto
it, rather then me dropping down and having the mob follow me all over
velks.. plus his damage is at least 50% of the mobs damage

When were in a really greedy exp mood (when we were first trying to get AA
levels asap) we would time the spawns and have pulling patterns.. between 2
people (and 3 chars) we could control something like 75% of the entire Velk
spiders (whether there was 15 people in the zone or 35)

We made our own little camp spot (we even gave it a name), and had a kill
rate greater then even upper/lower frenzy full groups heh
