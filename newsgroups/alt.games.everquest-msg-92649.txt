I would go with video card as the more likely culprit.  I am still
using my 800MHz PIII, but with a GeForce2 MX400, and it works nicely.
One other thing to check on, if you put the "USEUMBRA=False" line in
eqclient.ini, remove it, or set it to true, Luclin works much better
that way.  I was having a bad problem with framerate in Shadowhaven,
when I took that out, the problem went away.  I understand that in old
world zones, it will not work as well with Umbra enabled, I have not
noticed an effect yet.

Good Luck.

If you can figure out which dot to remove, you can email me, if you can't, I probably don't want to hear from you anyway.
