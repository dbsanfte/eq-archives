That's not so bad, having the resists. Once you get dual, however, you'll
want to wean yourself from shield use. Some secondary hand items - Gnoll
Hide Lariat included - actually give a small bit of AC, too (3), so there is
a slight balance there.

Until you are settled in what you'll be using, I'd recommend grabbing it.
You'll want it in your secondary hand. With it's slow delay, you'll be
swinging (or whipping) it much more often, which means more skill checks,
which means you'll get dual maxed out faster. But what you say below changes
that a bit, so read on ...

Ahhh, you make it interesting with all the choices. The Claws and Cutlass
both sound nice for your main hand. With it's lower delay and lower damage,
the Silvery War Axe would make a great secondary hand ... same as mine,
actually. It does respectable enough damage, but it's that delay that is
nice. A mere 23, just a touch higher than the lariat's 22, with double the
damage. Since your primary hand will still be doing most of the work, you
want your big hitter in your main hand.

If you can snag the claws, I'd suggest going with them in your main and the
axe in your off hand. You'll likely max out dual in two to three levels, if
all goes well. At that time, you can consider bringing the cutlass into play
for your secondary, as your skill will be in nice shape and you'll be able
to eat the extra 10 in delay. You'll just want something with a sub-25 delay
for your offhand to start off so you can boost that skill quickly.
