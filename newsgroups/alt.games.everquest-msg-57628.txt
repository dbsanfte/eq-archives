Create a level 1 ogre (or is it troll?) warrior of Rallos Zek,
run him to kael,
get bound at EW zone (IMPORTANT),
consent warrior from your main,
go near corpse,
drag,
get aggroed due to shitty velious draggro rules,
die,
respawn,
run back to corpse,
drag,
die,
rinse and repeat until corpse is close enough to safe area for main to loot
it

This should work even if the corpse is close to the Tormax area where the
warrior would be KoS because you can just drag it and die real real quick,
if you had problems with that, try to beg up some cleric hp buffs to get
more than 1 step before you die on the inital pull.
