I may have to disagree with you, Lance.

Simple camps, yes.  Time consuming?  VERY.  I lost 2 weeks of my
gaming life to those 2 camps.  Got the camp most evenings, 4 hours
later, camp out and hope to get the camp the next night.  *sigh*
Tedium.  Boring.  Blah.

Aye - but the Shard hunt was probably the worst of it all.  Dragging
folks to Skyfire almost everynight to help my little cleric (I tried,
but couldn't effectively solo there at 54 or 55) for about a month
before the final shard dropped.

Heh - I could never get 175 people in there killing.
