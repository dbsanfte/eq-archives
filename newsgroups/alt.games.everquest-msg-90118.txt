Would like to start a warrior but cant decide on race.

Am thinking ogre or vah shir.  Ogre I KNOW is toughest, but has
faction problems.  Vah Shir I think might be good, certainly has good
quests.

I guess almost all races can have a warrior.  I have an iksar monk
(which I love) so dont think I will do iksar.  Gnome warriors are cute
but would always be at a disadvantage. Same with halflings.

So this gives ogre, vah shir, dwarf, barbarian, troll, human, wood
elf, half elf, dark elf.

Does any particular race excel?

p.s.  not looking for role play or challenge.  Just want a good
warrior.

p.p.s  please dont tell me the player makes the warrior. LOL I'm a
good player and will be a good warrior.  But am curious about opinions
on race.
