Yup, often the GR would take the LR as well, seeing as it was usually 
empty, and an enchie could *really* help if we managed to pull more than 
we should have (I TOLD the monk I could hide/sneak in and keep an eye on 
things, but does that keep him from running in and out and instantly 
aggroing everything that pops just as something pops outside? 
Noooooooooo...)
