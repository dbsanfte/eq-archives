The caps on these skills tend to be so low that there are practically no
uses for them at all.  Yes, my bard can open the rock to get you into the
Hole... for the five people on the server who can't swim in on their own.
He can open the doors in Befallen, too, in case someone's lowbie alt falls
down to the bottom and can't gate out, he can walk down to rescue them.

That is about it.  The minimum skill to open up even something as low
level as the Crypt entrance in Seb is beyond a bard with a geerlock
lockpicking glove and maxed skill.  There aren't all that many "need a
lockpick" places in the game to begin with, the number of places that
don't require a skill over 110 to open is vanishingly small.

There are also very few interesting traps in the game, so few that I'm not
really as aware of whether bard skills are sufficient to deal with them.
I've never heard anyone say "well, we dont' have a rogue but the bard can
handle these traps"... but then again, perhaps not all that many people
are aware bards actually have the skills to start with.
