Congrats! : )

The bards I get, since at that level you don't have an AE resist song, just
group only.    But why would multiple enchanters be a bad thing?
Enchanters can Target Group Buff all of thier group items.   You're not
building 7 experience groups where each one needs to be self sufficient.
You're building one raid group.

Unless you were *very* short on healers, this was a mistake.   Naggy's
damage comes mostly from his AE.  And AE's hit everyone.   You pretty much
*need* a healer in each group to counter that, or you lose a good portion of
your DPS when people start dying.

Multiple healers only in the MT group(s) is only a really viable strategy on
straight up melee mobs.  Then sacrafice the twits that can't control aggro
as an object lesson.

He was feeding you a song and dance, or he was the biggest optimist I've
ever heard of.   Pickup type raids that have to try and convince enough
people to come never move out that quickly.   Heh... even some guilds don't
move out that quickly, unless they're practiced and committed.

A well run raid is something to behold, and fun at the same time.   IMO.

A poorly run raid is a nightmare.

Vox and Naggy especially tend to be the worst kind of raids.   The level
limit makes it hard to get anyone really experienced there, so you're
dealing with a *lot* of people who just don't know how to raid, and can't
follow instructions.   If you can even get them.   And once they do gain a
little seasoning, learn what spells to cast and when, etc... they're already
past the level where they can engage.
