Good. You've found your way up onto the battlement. The entrance should
be rather obvious if you take a walk around.
Unfortunately the entrance is not marked on your map. But its the
southernmost point on it!
Take a look at the maps at http://www.planeofmischief.com/maps.htm.
There you can find a few maps describing the way through Temple of
Veeshan. You can safely ignore them. :)
The first black and white drawing shows the PoM with the zone in and the
battlement. Where it says: 'to B' is where your map starts.
I hope you find your way in! :)

Depends on your group. But what would EQ be without a little risk? :)
I'd say yes you could take the first few nameds you encounter. But be
prepared. They hit damn hard and are only partially slowable as far as I
remember! I'm not sure if your enchanter is able to mezz there as
enchanters really have a gap in their mezzing capability from lvl57
onwards up to 61. I don't count the lvl59 rapture because of it's long
recast time.

You might want to check out: http://www.rpgexpert.com/1432.html as there
is a far better explanation than my clumsy description above. :P
