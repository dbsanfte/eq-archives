Alot of great info. Thanks for the detailed post. Ive tried the sewers
a few times (via Gamesh) and yes, the plant is very nasty. I held my
breath with each and every pull. It was kind of like playing Russian
Roulette. For those who want to try an easier one - try the Crematory
- its MUCH easier. Instead of mobs whacking you for 1200, they start
off at the 300 range (but gets a little harder deeper in - but didnt
see any hit over say 800 near the end).
