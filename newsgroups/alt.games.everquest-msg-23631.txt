Probably too many to count.  Some scowlers recognize that if they attack 
you, they will die and move on.  Some just hate your guts but will leave 
you alone regardless of whether than can kill you.  Others will try to rip 
your guts out so they can hate them closer regardless of your level.

I think each mob has a reaction level and an agressiveness level.
