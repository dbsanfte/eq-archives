EQ versus UO: I was on UO for two years, never got past an expert warrior,
never GMed skills, never bought a house so on and so on...One reason I am
finally giving up on UO is noone leaves the bank!! Just alot of "Can I
have...Can I buy." And alot of I'm a 3leeT Dood. It sucks. UO is all about
ego IMHO. (I do understand the time involved in mastering a char. but I
don't want to hear about it in a conversation to get a noob to bow down at
the superiority of the older chars. And it does happen.)
I play on Vaezelle, and not once have I heard anything similiar except in
the context of giving out advice or help.
So far I have picked the dumbest fucking name I could come up with, in the
spirit of my deity Bristlebane, started barding, and have so far loved every
minute I've played and never felt better about it. I didn't have that
feeling with UO.
Sure there have been problems (my biggest gripe is the kindergardenish
attitudes of some, very rare, players when it comes to camping. And that is
just a small gripe.)
So what is the point of my rambling? Just a longwinded thank you to my new
family of EQ players. If you're in NRO and need a locate, or whatever..just
say hi. I don't want nothing. Just an invite to group once in a while, I
don't care about getting twinked or buffed or even loot..at a 10 bard, I
only want to level and afford my new songs as they come. You all really
saved me from the morass of UO. Seriously..everyone has been super friendly
and cool.
