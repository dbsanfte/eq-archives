Oooh, a new and innovative way to misspell Rogue, or were you spelling
Rouge?

If you meant Rouge, then I would definately put as much as possible into
Charisma, it is far too low to start with.

If you meant Rogue, then, I understand that Dex and Str are important later
in life with Backstab, but, they are not too difficult to raise with
equipment.  Stamina means HP, and, of course, stamina over 100 is a good
thing.  Of course, I don't play a Rogue, so, what do I know?

For that matter, Mr. Wizzy, should I have chosen a deity for my Gnomey
Wizard?  He's only level 3, and it's not too late to change that.
