I don't think they ever stop attacking...but eventually, you can just ignore
them.  Hell, I'm a wimpy 53 Wizard, and my standing regen rate is higher
than their average damage, so they don't actually bug me, unless I'm trying
to memorize a spell (when you are sitting, pretty much anything can hit you,
which makes you stand) or want to meditate.

Actually, it's possible to memorize spells while being attacked.  When you
med skill is maxed out in your 50's, you mem spells quite fast, so as long
as you are quick on the mouse, you can get a spell memmed between their
attacks.
