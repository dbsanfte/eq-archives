This is my biggest pet peeve about AO. The instancing gets boring after a
short few times through them. I burned out going to the same places all the
time. This time through (just heard the WISH beta is starting Jan 1..
yay!!) my wife and I are going to explore "out in the bush". Don't get me
wrong, instancing is great when you want a quick mission - but rely on them
too much and it'll bore you to tears.
