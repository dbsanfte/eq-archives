Not to mention the "take some
out here, and plug some in here" type of style
that patching
requires when you're talking millions of lines of code.  I would say
that Sony probably
has top of the line programmers working for
them, but even a very good programmer has a hard
time reading and rewriting code that has so much legacy crap
in it.  Especially when the
code base is so monolithic that no single person
can know where
everything
is or what everything
does.
