You can, I've done it.  Just copy the whole EQ directory
back to the disk after you've reformatted (or even to
a brand new computer), and you're set to go.

The only thing you'll have to do by hand is set up a
new desktop icon/shortcut to launch everquest.exe
(unless you really like browsing to it in Windows Explorer
every time and double-clicking it, or launching it by
name from a DOS prompt).
