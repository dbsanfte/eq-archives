OK, so I had the right idea but was -waaaaay- off base as to what the
total would come to.

Now for the really too much time on your hands research inclined, how
many levels would that much exp come to if you were going 59 to 60?
What if you extended the curve (to whatever extent there is a curve
instead of a jagged slope) upwards for level 61, 62, etc?  Surely by
either of those levels you wouldn't be at level 300 (399 for those
wishing to bank points)
