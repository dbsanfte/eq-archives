Shaman are an extreme case, tend to have small mana pools and
costly duties, but with very substantial mana regen.  A cleric
using 10% mana per fight and getting it back, and a shaman using
50% mana per fight and getting it back in the same time period
wouldn't be at all unlikely... but the shaman hasn't got the
luxury of saying "go ahead and pull, I'm at 20M but no biggie"
like the cleric would.

Or perhaps he has, since by the time the puller gets back with
that mob he's at 60M again, while the cleric who said that at 20M
is now at 30M!

I'm not sure I follow you; your paragraph except for the first
sentence seems to agree with me, but at first sentence claims the
reverse.

Well, it certainly has to be enough for a "normal" pull, if your
shaman uses 60% of his mana pool on a normal pull he's not much
of a candidate for any plan that pulls at less than 60M... and
his margin for emergencies even at FM isn't really very large.
