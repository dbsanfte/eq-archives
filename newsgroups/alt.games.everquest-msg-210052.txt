Listen to yourself..level 59!?!?!?

That is RIDICULUS!!!

Nobody should have to wait 'till their level is nearly maxed before
being able to use an ability they should be good at starting level
*one*. 

Remember, there once was at time, when level 50 was the max. Back
then, there were no AA, there were no level 59's. The skill was
designed according to those specs. Few may actually remember that
though these days it seems....

Verants way of "fixing" the problem by adding aa to compensate for the
lack of the skill to be any good is just ridiculus.
