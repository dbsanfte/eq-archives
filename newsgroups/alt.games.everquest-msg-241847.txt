 I honestly can't recall ever seeing it... but then I honestly can't
recall ever looking for it either. My video cards are modern... I'm
barely cognizant of hardware requirements for games... 

Was that information disclosed through an official channel, one that
was pushed out to the customers? Specifically:

1) Patch messages
2) Message of the Day
3) Pop-up message like the one used to advertise the long-term dealie?
4) Notification via direct email message sent directly to customers
(ie not the eq newsletter)

and maybe
5) EQ email Newsletter (and since a number of people opt out of it,
this one barely qualifies)

If it wasn't in the above ... then yeah I'd call it unethical.

EQLive doesn't count... many players never go there. Allakhazam forums
don't count.  Web sites/forums are on par for ethics with...
