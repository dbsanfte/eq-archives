That doesn't explain why the Kunark epics are still languishing in
near obselescence... 

They're the same amount of work, and they're rapidly falling into the
category of 'why bother' with players that don't already have them.

Sure a new epic needs to be good for it to be worth it... but its
clearly unbalanced vis a vis the old epics. The natural conclusion is
that the old epics need an upgrade, or a 'quest entension' resulting
in new epics ...
