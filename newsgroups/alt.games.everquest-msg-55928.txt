I wasn't expecting you to read my posts, just the posts referring to
the events.  I had mentioned the melee range issue, along with several
other people.

Aren't you an enchanter?  I thought that one of the reason that people
played an enchanter was that you didn't have to drag friends around
with you, people sort of flocked to you.  Hell, I know that enchanters
can solo, but I would think that even druids would think better of
soloing in a place with about 30 mobs pathing past you ever time you
turn around.  
I saw several people putting together pick-up groups to take down the
Blood Reaver, it may have been worth it to stick around, just to say
you did.
