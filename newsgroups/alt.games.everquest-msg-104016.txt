Built in sound isn't always crap though - any more.  I just built a
system for my neighbor using a Soyo mobo with built in 6-channel
sound.  Optical in and outs, RCA jacks, the works.  Damn thing (to me
at any rate) sounds niiiiiice.  Granted, I'm not really an audiophile
at this 'little speaker' level (although I used to be a soundman for a
traveling 'ballroom' rock band) but I'm pretty sure his built-in sound
puts my SoundBlaster to absolute shame.
