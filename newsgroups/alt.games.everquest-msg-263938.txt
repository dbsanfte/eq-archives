Mathematically, what happened to doesn't fit with what SOE's FAQ says.

I'm doing math on the fly here, so anyone who sees a mistake, please 
correct me (paging MSB):

Total number of players in party = y
Your total debt from dieing = x
Other party member's debt due to dieing = a
Other party member's debt due to dieing = b
Other party member's debt due to dieing = c
.
.
.
Other party member's debt due to dieing = d

You die, and x debt is accumulated.
0.5x goes to you, 0.5x is distributed amongst the y party member.

Here is where things get interesting. There are two possibilities. The 
first is that everyone in the party (including he who dies) shares the 
debt. The other is that only the other players share the debt. I will 
with the assumption that everyone shares the debt.

So, each person (including yourself) gets 0.5x/y added to their debt.
If everybody dies, then you get 

0.5a/y + 0.5b/y + 0.5c/y +...+ 0.5d/y + 0.5x/y    	    	[1]

debt added for each of the party members. 
Thus, total debt works out to.

0.5x + 0.5a/y + 0.5b/y + 0.5c/y +...+ 0.5d/y + 0.5x/y    	[2]

If it is the other case, everybody gets 

0.5a/(y-1) + 0.5b/(y-1) + 0.5c/(y-1) +...+ 0.5d/(y-1)    	[3]

added to their debt.

You now have to consider the amount of debt each person earns (before 
being split up) due to dieing.

If it is all the same (a = b = c = ... = d = x), then you can replace a, 
b, c, ..., d in [2] by x. Then, [2] reduces down to 

y * 0.5x/y = 0.5x     	    	    	    	    	    	    	[4]

Similarly, [3] will reduce in a similar manner to 

(y-1) * 0.5x/(y-1) = 0.5x    	    	    	    	    	    	[5]

An interesting result comes out here, [4] = [5]. So it doens't matter if 
you share your debt completely or not.

Thus, to get the debt you earn from a TPW, you add your half of the debt 
(0.5x) plus (0.5x) (the shared debt) to get the total amount of debt you 
will be getting.

0.5x + 0.5x = x
 So the total amount of debt you get in a TPW *should* be identical to 
the amount of debt you get when you die solo. (Tricky tricky tricky SOE)

Things start to get interesting if there are various levels in the party. 
If there is a wide range of levels in the party, then the lower level 
player is going to get completely bombed with debt. The half of debt that 
he is sharing is going to be smaller than his portion of the total shared 
debt. 

If players are a higher level, a, b, c, ..., d will be higher than x. 
Thus

0.5a/y + 0.5b/y + 0.5c/y +...+ 0.5d/y + 0.5x/y    	    	[1]

will have 

(0.5a/y + 0.5b/y + 0.5c/y +...+ 0.5d/y) > 0.5x/y

(the same applies to the (y-1) case, however the lower level players get 
even more debt under that case)
