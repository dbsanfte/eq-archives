As a soloing level 39-41 shaman in DSP, I've found that two
applications of extended Venom of the Snake will take a large zelniak
(which is what I mostly exp on) to ~15-18% health, at which point I
can just leave my pet on it while killing the next. During the ~2
minutes this takes, I regain almost all the mana for the VotS and
roots, with mana preservation II. And that's without KEI, I've never
had KEI, I imagine that would force me to keep multiple mobs rotting
at all times to keep up.

This leaves my pet sitting down over half the time, which is perhaps a
sub-optimal use of him, but OTOH I can kill a mob that gives 1% exp
about every 2-3 minutes until I get jumped by a wolf, which eats a lot
of mana because wolves are much harder than zelniaks. And sometimes I
get jumped by multiple wolves, at which point zoning is the wisest
course of action.

On the whole, this beats most of my pick-up groups for exp, though
usually groups are more fun. The loot on wolves and Zelniaks is
essentially non-existent, though, so I'm going to be very short on
cash soon unless I start finding groups.

For any root-rotter wanting to solo about 29-42 (at least, can't speak
for level 42+ yet) or so, Dawnshroud Peaks is a great place, and
zelniaks are animals so can be feared/charmed by rangers/druids. It
probably isn't so good for quad-kiting, because the open areas tend to
have wanderers, but I've never quad-kited, so I can't compare.

I seem to be rambling, but perhaps someone will find this useful.
