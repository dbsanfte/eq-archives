So this sounds like a place where fighting alone would be a bad idea. 
If you are willing to take the chance on dying or making a very long run
for the zone, attack at will, but discretion being the better part and
all that.  It's not the class or the level that is the issue here, it is
the location.  If you recognized that should a fight go wrong you have
no option other than death, or the options are unacceptable, then it's
time to pass the fight up.  All part of the thinking one would expect to
be involved as opposed to blue=exp which involves no thinking at all,
just point and click.  The con color and message is akin to looking at
someone across the room, you size them up.  Anyone who has spent time
bar brawling or what have you will tell you that looks can be deceiving,
the ones you think are not dangerous sometimes are and  you don't know
till the fight has started.  This is one of the features that makes EQ
interesting to me, it makes you think on the fly rather than just
calculate everything in advance.
