I've been submitting the idea as well, repeatedly. I'm just not vain enough to
take credit for it :-)

I think its a great way to clue people in to new quests, remind them of
underutilized quests and to help us discover the as-yet "undiscovered" quests
while keeping the info in-game. It doesn't have to be obvious (I don't think the
Times' suggestion to "speak with Qeynos merchants" was too obvious) and that
only adds to the sense of accomplishment. "Hey, I found a new quest! All by
myself! It may be a lame one, but I FOUND A NEW QUEST!"

And actually, I think these are NOT lame. It is always nice to have a means of
increasing faction with merchants, especially ways that do not involve killing
overcamped spawns. (Average life expectancy of a Gnoll in NQ/QH and BB is less
than 2 seconds during peak hours.)
