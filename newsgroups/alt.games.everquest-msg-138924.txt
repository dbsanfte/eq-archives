As a matter of fact I have just spent some time in Gfay recently and I was
wondering about all the ooc's and shouts from people looking for various
parts.  I just couldn't imagine the armor reward being worth all the time
that was being spent chasing after some rare part.  Chances are that with
prices in the bazaar as low as they are you would be better off selling off
CB belts and heading to the bazaar to buy a few pieces of armor.
