If the exp is seeming to suck, try hard. I tried one last night with my
55 shaman, a bot druid, a cleric, war and monk. We didn't go in
expecting to win, we didn't win. But, we found it a lot easier than we
expected, from experience with our L65 mains. Mid 50's hard are nothing
like 65 hard missions. The one we got had a mix of blue to yellow mobs
that hit in the range of 200-225 or so. If we'd dumped the bot druid and
had two other dps classes I'm quite confident we could have beaten it.
