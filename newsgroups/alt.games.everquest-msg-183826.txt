> I think you are equating Skill with Physical Dexterity.

Yeah, he's talking about the kind of skill you need to play console games
where you need to hit a bunch of buttons in sequence, or mash a couple at
the same time while moving at just the right speed to get past an obstacle.
EQ has very little of that type of skill which is one of the reasons I like
it.
