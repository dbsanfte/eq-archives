Well, these don't sound like newbies to me, sounds more like the beggar
class...

Real newbies don't know much about this sort of thing.

I remember once, after paying a visit to the kelithin rangers guild, I
was standing out front going thru my inventory and realized that I had a
couple of fine steel weapons I needed to unload. Right at that moment a
brand new ranger spawns in front of me, blinks a couple of times, and
spins around.

Our conversation went like this:

Me: "You just came by at the right time"
Him: "Have you got some realy good armor for me?"
Me: "Ahhh wrong answer"
-I walk away-
Him in tell: "Wait a minute, you can't walk away from me like that"
Me in tell: "Sir, I am free to do as I please"

These days if I have a stuff I want to give away I go to the newbie zone
and watch for people with little or no equipment who are working hard,
real newbies, and I avoid beggars like the plague they are.

-Michael
