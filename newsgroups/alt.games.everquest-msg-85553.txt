Talking about the paper kind...I'm getting better at reading online but I
still prefer to be able to bow my head while reading, and, of course, not
have to worry about refresh rates.

PCMagazine, a long trusted and good magazine has slowly gone from "a
magazine for computer users, touching on internet issues as they're related
to personal computers," to "a magazine for internet professionals touching
on personal computers as they're related to the internet."

Yeah, you can also say lots of bad things about the magazine...how they kiss
the ass of Intel, Microsoft, Symantec, etc., but they were still the best 5
years ago.

Thanks. :)
