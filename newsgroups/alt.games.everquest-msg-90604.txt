Consider yourself one of the "lucky" one's with respect to WINXP and SB
Audigy.  Most of us using Dell/Intel/GeForce3/etc hardware combinations are
either still pulling their hair out trying to get it to work in 4 speaker
mode or have giving up (like myself) and returned that piece of junk.  The
Audigy definitely sounded better, but I could not justifiy reinstalling my
OS repeatedly, or rearranging my expansion cards because Creative did not
make this device 100% ACPI compliant.

I went back to using the SB Live! Value in 4 speaker mode.  I've disabled in
game music entirely.  Perhaps last weeks patch fixed the stuttering problem,
but I probably won't go back to using music since its not really worth the
trouble.
