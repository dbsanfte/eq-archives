Limited AI on the mobs meant it would be too easy to hide in places the mobs
couldn't get, IE in a shop where that Griffin can't follow but on the other
hand that griffin could tear that shop down to get to you. So instead mobs
ignore the vert axis and any buildings...what is annoying is when they are
underground so you are not able to attack them back. If Verant are going to
give them the ability to hit us from that position, at least let the mob
show itself...

Anyway, you'll get used to it
