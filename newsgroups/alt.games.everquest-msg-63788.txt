I must have missed where you mentioned that PvP in DAoC had equality for
people with highly disperate levels.

Isn't. During beta, one of the higher-up beta testers who had a lot of
contact with the Devs posted the xp table for 1-50. I don't recall the
figures precisely (and I don't think the beta board is still around to do
the searching), but it took 3 times more even level kills to go from 40 to
41 than it took to go from 30 to 40. The idea was that player abilities
flattened out between 40 and 50 (where people in PvP who were 40 and 50
would be basically on even footing...I have no idea how well that came
out), so to get people to do "stuff" rather than level grinding, they made
level grinding as painful as possible without making the xp bar actually
stop moving.

This doesn't take into account the fact that you lose 6-8 hours of solid
killing with a Rezzed/Gravestone Prayed death between 40-50. My guess is
that since fighting the mobs would be so risk-free by that point, that the
chance of death would be very minimal.
