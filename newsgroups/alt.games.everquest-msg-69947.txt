More bullets for the back cover:

* Pay $30 only to see it on sale 2 days later!

* Pay $30 for new enhanced graphics and turn them all off to play the game!

* Pick a new face only to have it randomly change for no apparent reason!

* Pay large sums of in game cash for a horse that you can out run!

* Help the poor destitute memory and processor chip companies by buying upgrades
  for your computer!

* Thrill to seeing the much lauded BSOD (Blue Screen Of Death[tm]) many times!
