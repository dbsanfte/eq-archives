Not going to go through the whole thread, but as others
have said there is going to be "poopy" language you
encounter on the internet. This is not network TV. 

If you are concerned for your child, don't worry, they hear much worse
language on the playground starting at age 4. Yes, that includes
the playground your child is at right now. If you are worrying about
a 14 year old, they could say things to you that would make your hair
fall out even if they hardly know what the internet is.

That being said I never resort to such language myself very much 
on the net or in real life. I find that anytime I wish to express
surprise or any kind of exclamation, "holy crud" or "oh my freaking
god", are more than enough. Even better than those obvious
replacements, I find its best to think of a better word or phrase. 

For example; rather than saying (while at work) " I hate this
freaking(censor) place!" You really say more while not being Ms potty
mouth by saying,

"someday I hope to escape this wretched pit of doom and despair, once
again walking in the flowers under that mystery which I call "the
sun." 

This will also give your coworkers a newfound appreciation for you,
the idea that you are being funny or ironic, or will just make them
avoid you. Where I work, any of these are fine.
