Prove what, exactly, that Everquest is a real-time chatroom? It's a pretty 
standard feature of MMORPGs, and even the MUDs they were, for the most 
part, based on.  The easiest way to -prove- it would be to have you play 
everquest and see for yourself.

You can get a free everquest account for a 30-day trial at 
http://pc.ign.com/articles/364/364866p1.html and download EQ from a link 
on that page as well.
