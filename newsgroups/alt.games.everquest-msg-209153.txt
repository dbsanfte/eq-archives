I've heard that. But I beleive its an after the fact rationalization. Why
create a cost to zoning that specifically penalizes pet classes exclusively?
No I think illusions dropping, and pets dropping, and the few other zone
issues were implementation consequences not design parameters.

Can you really see it? I mean ... the designers are sitting around drinking
coffee & coke and one of them says "Pet casters should lose their pets when
they zone...their life is a little too easy... and this cost on zoning would
really balance them out."
