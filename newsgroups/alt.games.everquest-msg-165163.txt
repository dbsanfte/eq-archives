Find a cleric.

Charm a mammoth.

Have mammoth fight IB.

Cleric Cheals mammoth while it tanks, and chain stuns it whenever charm breaks.

Mana expenditure and time to a kill is far lower this way, but you do have to share exp with
the cleric.  Fortunately, the cleric can be a rediculously low level considering you are
killing a level 61 mob; he only has to be able to stick stuns to a level 50 or so mob, and
CHeal.

The PH killing thing sucks.
