What rules? If the object taken did not belong to the person who has 
been scammed, how can there be a violation of the rules? The fact that 
there are rules concerning in-game theft and fraud presumes that within 
the context of the game there is such thing as ownership, even if in 
real life all the game items *including your character* belong to Verant.

To drive the point further home... When was the last time you heard a GM, 
when asked to retrieve an item lost to a bug reply: 'Sorry, but that 
didn't belong to you, it belongs to Verant anyway, so you are SOL'.

Sorry, but the argument that there is no ownership in the game because 
everything ultimately belongs to Verant carries very little weight.
