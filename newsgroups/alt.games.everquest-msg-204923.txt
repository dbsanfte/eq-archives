Hmmm, for a non-level restricted weapon in the hands of a char under
50 or so you may be right about bang for the buck.  Let's see, at L45
the BA Halberd is 40/49 +16, clearly better than an el cheapo Weighty
Polearm's 26/34 +10 at that level.  At L50 tho it's 40/49 +19 vs.
29/34 +13, so at 50 the BA Halberd won't outdamage the WP unless its
bonus damage and/or procs add 5% or so to its damage (seems likely),
while the WP gives 35hp 15ac 15agi and higher agro due to being faster.
So, I'd say a Ranger (or non-tanking tank) would prefer the BA Halberd
(usually more damage, nice proc when it happens, less damage taken
from DS and riposte, and it's kinda cool to use a weapon that likes it
when the mob is MR debuffed), while a Paladin or SK who was tanking
would probably get better use out of the flea-market-bargain WP with
it's +ac +hp and more reliable agro generation.

Yeah, I remember when 7k was a "bargain" for them, now you're seeing 2k?

Maybe what they did was fail to set the 2h flag in the proc script for
the Halberd then, heheh, oops.
