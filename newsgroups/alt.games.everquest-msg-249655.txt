As others have said, the paladin.  No question.  The DPS difference is 
minimal and not that important.  What's really important is, when you're 
threeboxing and something goes wrong, the Paladin has many, many more 
tools for you to turn the situation back around with.  And I speak from 
experience when I say, when you're threeboxing, something will go wrong. 
:)

Would you rather kill 300 mobs and only need rezzes twice, or 350 mobs and 
have to stop and hunt up rezzes for the wizard 10 times? :)

Of course, either is doable.  My threeboxing (when I wasn't PLing) was 
mostly 64 dru, 65 enc, and a 63 rogue trying to tank.  Ha. :)
