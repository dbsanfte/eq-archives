Did you do the infamous "upgrade" from ME to 2K or did you format
and start fresh?

NEVER, NEVER, NEVER "upgrade" unless you absolutely have to, 
especially from the 16/32 bit Win9x code to the full 32 bit
NT/2K code.  If you did "upgrade" (it should really be called
"destroy"), then I'd imagine that you'll be seeing all kinds
of other problems with stability, drivers, and other fun,
hard-to-track-down stuff.  Format and start fresh with 2K and
you'll be pleased -- I've been using it since the day it came
out and I'll NEVER go back to the 9X code (especially the 
shitty ME).

Now, if you did a completely fresh install on a formatted
disk, I'd say that you have driver problems of some kind (or a
flaky piece of hardware).  First, make sure that you are not
using any "NT" drivers, especially for video and sound.  Next,
try moving your PCI cards around -- PCI is supposedly free
of irq conflicts and such, but try telling that to my SCSI
card that was "colliding" with my NIC...
