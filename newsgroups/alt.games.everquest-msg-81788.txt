It seems in most group people have the idea it is good to have a full
group just to have that full group exp bonus.  The posts from those in
the know confirm my suspicions that I do not get more exp from having
an extra group member, unless the killing rate is notably increased.
But, I don't want to be unkind and say no to the person standing in
front of us asking if he can join our group.  Although, if that person
comes from a highly demanded class, it isn't so bad in case one of the
original group members leaves and even if not, it is good to get to
know other players.
