Not sure what budget you're working on, so looking at a  reasonable one and
that you haven't got the Guild behind you get some of the better, no drop,
weapons.

Big hitting 2hders, especially ones that proc with the frequency of
Felhammer, are great for holding aggro but, as you seem to have noticed, the
slow speed makes them unreliable if you miss too many times in a row.

I'd suggest looking at low 20 - hi teen delay 1hders for reliability.
Lammies(defiance), Winters Fury, Jade Mace, Velium Warswords (Tempered,
Engraved, Fired, Polished or Exquisite) and the like.

Proc's, discussed in previous thread, are considered by some to be essential
to hold aggro, I don't share this PoV (although both my 1hders proc) but do
agree they are a definite help, just don't sacrifice too much ratio for it.

Look at Blood Points (my personal fav) Black Blade(s) of Tormenting (a bit
weak in dam, IMO, but proc lives up to it's name, Torment)  Frostbringer and
Sarny Warhammer, there maybe be better but I am guessing they are well out
of most peoples price range, the Warhammer will be close to 10k,
Frostbringer 5 or 6k, blood points 3k and BBoT 1k.
The Venomous Axe, you have, doesn't have the ratio at 50+ to be of real use.
For high damage the Club of the Ice Ocean probably has the most for a 1hder
(the can be picked up under 10k) with 149pnt Frost Strike but it's Centi LS
ratio (14/27) makes it a better off hand weapon than primary.

If you do carry a proc'ing weapon and are tanking try and get a decent Dex
buff if there is one available, Boon of garou is good, 100pnt Dex + it's own
lifetap proc, although I expect any Enchanter to be casting this on the MT
anyway.
