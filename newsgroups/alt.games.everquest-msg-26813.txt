And here a friend was laughing at me last night for having the
ambition of reaching level 60 and doing big things one day, since he
thinks everyone will be playing Shadowbane by the time that happens :)

Oh, and I got asked by a stranger (after porting her to Feerrott) if I
wanted to tag along to Fear last night. Was only 4 blues into 46, so I
passed. Next time, however... :)
