Sounds like a bunch of whining from those who weren't able to steal the
election for Mr. Gore.  Of course, if you weren't already aware that the
U.S. was a pluarlity system (and you're a U.S. voter), then I really must
question your ability to cast an informed vote.  Those who voted for Nader
knew he had no chance of winning, and still did so.  In other words, they
chose to _vote against Gore_.  Why should they get additional
representation?  The system works as intended, as long as the laws are
followed (which was the problem in Florida).

The truely amusing thing is this:

"Another is the Borda count, a point system devised by the 18th-century
French mathematician Jean Charles Borda, which is now used to rank college
football and basketball teams. "

Not the best example, considering that the college ranking system is
commonly believed to be an abomination.
