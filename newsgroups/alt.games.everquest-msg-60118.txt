	Your ability to prepare is not at issue.  The opposition will not engage
unless it feels it has an overwhelming advantage.

	And neither will you.

	There is a (IIRC) Sioux saying: "the wolf wins every fight but his last,
and in that one, he dies."  The first law of any predator is to avoid a fair
fight at all costs, not because you cannot win, but because you can't afford
to try.  So it goes in PvP muds.  DAoC is not going to be like the War of the
Roses, with enemy commanders meeting before the battle to discuss terms of
engagement and what time of day to call a cease-fire so they can break for
tea.

	Again, this is conflating the initial conditions with the actual
conditions.
