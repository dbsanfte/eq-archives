As I understand it, charisma will not affect the chance of resisting, it 
will affect the chance of aggroing a mob when a pacify is resisted.  If you 
do not currently keep it on yourself, then, you should cast Intellectual 
Superiority, it raises your effective casting level by 6, at least 
according to Lucy.

Of course, I could be completely mistaken, I have not played my enchanter 
all that much.
