I got one buddy key, when I should have got 0 or 2.  I cancelled both
accounts a few months ago, and one reached the end of its billing cycle that
month, and the other reached the end sometime last month, so both accounts
are inactive now.  So...I should not have received a buddy key, according to
the description in the mailing.  If the mailing is wrong and inactive
accounts are supposed to get buddy keys, then I should have received two,
not zero.  So in either case, they screwed up. :-)
