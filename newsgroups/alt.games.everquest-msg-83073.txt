You misunderstand.  You have often flouted your ignorance of argument
and argued exclusively from authority.  But never mind.

Physician, heal thyself.  It is your responsibility to accurately
convey what you mean, and when you toss undisciplined and overburdened
prose out for all to see and complain that no one understands you you
have only yourself to blame.

By the way, I mean that.  Your writing (on matters of nonfiction)
strikes me as seriously undisciplined.

So you imply Billo is being dishonest (and not merely disagreeing with
you in a way that leaves you groping--there _is_ a difference)?

Rubbish.

I found this statement to be largely meaningless.

I take it this is your way of changing the subject.  It certainly
doesn't have anything to do with the prior discussion in any
meaningful way.
