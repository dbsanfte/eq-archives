I would have to agree, I have a 22 level pally and though i have fun
roleplayer her, I wish I had not picked an High Elf (don't ask me why it was
my second char I ever made and was still new at it).  I would do a cleric
and see, I just made one and gave her some bone armor i had, she is doing
fine in BB now.  And I get tells and invites to groups, my pally never
really did unless they needed to fill the 6th slot up.   I would suggest a
dwarf, only because if you have to do melee it helps with thier strength and
wisdom items can be found.  (again though i had extra to begin with and
tweeked mine a little).

if you do a pally again, a dwarf is a good choice.
