There is, but two people were indeed banned for having "past warnings"
on their accounts.  As I've heard it, one had a warning from a year
ago (while in another guild entirely) for having a pissing contest
with members of another guild, and Itzlegend (the raid leader) had a
warning from *way* back in his character's teens, for doing something
unorthodox with the Aviaks.

Hardly a life-long pattern of exploit abuse, but Verant's policies
allow them to ban anyone who has had at least one prior warning, ever,
so they used it.
