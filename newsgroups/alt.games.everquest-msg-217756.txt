Tim,

Pacify lasts 45 seconds.  Phinney's guards won't see invis, though Phinney
does.  So what you'll need is to get Phinney dead, then use invis potions
(10pp a pop at your local potion vendor) to get past his guards.  Always
keep an invis potion hotkeyed; they're instant cast, so when you see 'you
begin to appear' fire the next one and you won't lose invis.  Find the
fingerbone you need and get out.  Oh, and it's not on the floor, either -
there are two ledges down at Phin's level with rocks on them; its on top of
one of those - the one without the green seaweed nearby.  (I've only helped
about three paladins with this so far.  :) )
