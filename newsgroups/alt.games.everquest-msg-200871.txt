<sniff, sniff>

I smell pure bullshit.  Cite the studies.  Show the raw data from said 
studies.  

But, I'm intrigued:  Is it a conclusion, as you admitted, or a hypothsis
[sic]?

And maybe I'm wrong about this, but what kind of research is this?  This 
kind of "interview" is BOUND to result in significant numbers of invalid 
(read that as "made up") answers, provided you get ANY.  So how do you 
weed those out?

I will say it again...bullshit.
