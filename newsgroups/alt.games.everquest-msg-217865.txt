The lifetap has a few distinctions:
1) Lifetap heals you for the amount of damage it does. I'd much rather have
a lifetap (yes 50 points isn't that much. 50 points on a fast swinging
double attack'd weapon with a high dex... can be very useful especially for
the midrange level crowd. My 25 monk would love one of those.)
2) Lifetaps in general are considered to be 'higher agro'. If that's the
case, tanks would prefer it for holding agro.

Interestingly according to Lucy, the lifetap is fire based (that's what the
save is) so that really doesn't enter into the equation. Basically they are
the exact same spell except one is target: single, the other target: Lifetap

Maybe they just think MM points may be a bit easier to earn? Or the LDoN
team are just whacked in the head for item pricing?
