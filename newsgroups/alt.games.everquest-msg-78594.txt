This, like it or not, has been the status since release. It's a very bad 
idea indeed to start an Enchanter as anything other than Agnostic. I take 
it you are at least level 20, if you have Illusion: Iksar, so it's 
probably too late to re-roll, but your enchanter will be, if not as 
crippled as if you had chosen a less neutral deity, at least severely 
handicapped.
