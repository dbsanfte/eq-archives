How about an AA to give everyone a Pet, and then an AA to self buff
KIE for casters. =)

Honestly, I'd also get a forage AA in an instant, (Hell I'd grind out
20AAs just to get forage) but while foraging isn't exactly a huge
balance issue, it is a class defining ability for druids and rangers,
and I'd hate to take that away from them.
