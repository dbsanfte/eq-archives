True, you get:

A. An account that might be banned, or will be if VI find out it was sold.

B. A character class you with 99% chance dont know how to play.

C. If you because of B dont know how to play (level 40 warrior dont know the
way to Freeport from WC ring, warrior dont know what taunt is, or the worst,
a chanter that have no experience) people WILL notice, and probably wont
group with you again. A level 60 chanter bought somewhere will be a level 40
chanter withouh any possability for ever getting a group again, unless youre
REALLY lucky.

D. Lack the enjoying time levelling up yourself.

E. Lack basic knowledge on how to work in groups, how your skills/spells
work and so on. Again something that can make sure you will never get a
group again.
