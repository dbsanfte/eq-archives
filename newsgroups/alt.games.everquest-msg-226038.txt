Thanks for your reply.

It depends on what you call easy I suppose. I was envisioning a system
where the different aspects of a quest are multiplied by tuning
constants and added together. If necessary the resultant number could
be applied to some function (x^(1/2) ie the square root of x for
example to make it more difficult at higher scores).

Even though not all quest information related to a player may be
stored (which I would dispute - I highly doubt they would throw such
data away. Even with thousands of quests we are probably talking about
a few megs of data in a well designed system at most per character
which is easily feasible), it cannot be disputed that the quests
themselves must be stored in some sort of database or distributed data
system of some sort, from which the raw quest information can be
extracted. A good database administrator can extract data items like
the following for each quest:

- a) # of NPCs involved
- b) level of NPCs
- c) # of items invlolved
- d) level of items (required, suggested, flags[no drop lore magic
etc], vendor price, rarity (based on drop tables), stats on it, etc)
- e) starting ZEM/ending ZEM
- f) involved zone's ZEMs

and it can be affected by other data:
- g) class xp modifier
- h) race xp modifier
- L) level of player (in a negative way)

and statistical tools:
- control multipliers [c1, c2, ...]
- special quest multipliers set for specific quests that GMs want
uniquely more or less worth (m and n)

the quest difficulty could then be determined by computing some
variation of the below:
questxp = c1(c2*a + c3*b + c4*c + c5*d + c6*e + c7*f) * g * h * (c8/L)
* m + n

The result of this equation would then probably be applied to some
function that brings the results into a range of 1-100 on a curved
scale. If I had the range and domain of the function I'd write you
one. It will probably involve a power of (1/x) where x could be a
constant or variable.

The coders would have to create the system on Test and play with the
c1 - c8 variables and the function at the end to adjust things to work
right ... no biggie 8 values and one function.

And there you have a possible difficulty rating from 1-100 for every
quest without actually looking at each quest.

Now this was just done of the top of my head. There may be lots of
other variables that are easily obtainable, such as if it's a
raid-quest or the aera of the zone (kunark, luclin, ykesha, pop... )
that could be factored in with minimal effort.

Now this is not necessarily 'easy', but it's feasible to create such a
system with not too much work. And I think it would be within the
realm of a game update or an expansion.

True, but it can't be that difficult to a few more data items to the
character file/db-entry. All it takes is a long string where every bit
resembles one quest as completed or not, and one integer (or float
...) for every stat (there are maybe 30 of those at most?). Shouldn't
be that difficult to add. Again not necessarily easy, but not
unreasonable either.
