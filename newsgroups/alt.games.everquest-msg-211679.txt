Moving up to level 60, (and this is just a guess based on unscientific
observation, assuming reasonably equivalent gear), the highest
sustainable DPS class is probably either monk or rogue.  After level
60, rangers may pass these two classes with archery AA's.  I couldn't
say where mages or beastlords would sit on that list.
