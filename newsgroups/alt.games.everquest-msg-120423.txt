Don't bet on the happy part.  As I understand it, it makes raising your
smithing skill up even to your current level much more difficult.  Sure,
those of us that advanced to 175+ prepatch will be able to make FS with ease
now, and banded is now trivial at 115 or so.  I have two characters with
smithing at 175+, so it is probably a good thing for me, but my
understanding is that it makes Smithing more in line with Tailoring as far
as ability to grandmaster it.
