Ummmm... he came up with *titles*, DT. Only *Titles*. No article behind
them. Did *you* bother to read the fucking article? I can start a new
thread here right now with a subject line called "Best Strategies for
Camping the FBSS in Guk" which would certainly *appear* to be on topic.
But if the body of the post is a recipe for my grandmother's fucking
chicken soup, then it's not bloody well on topic, is it? And even if the
subject line isn't crafted to look tremendously on topic (even though it
*does* mention EQ in this case) but the body of it turns out to be an
article that discusses the game of EQ and public perceptions of EQ
players, then it's FUCKING WELL ON TOPIC!!!!!!!!!
Jezus H. Fucking Keerist on a cracker! Is this rocket science? I think
not. Ben was being a Dick. The article was on topic for the newsgroup.
Move on.
