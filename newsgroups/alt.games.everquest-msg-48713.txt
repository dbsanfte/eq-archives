Not sure if this is a new upgrade or been around for a while kinda
tooka  break from my 41 rogue for a while.  Was playing it today, and I
now stay hidden after an evade til I either move by walking/being hit or
backstabbing.  My normal attacking isn't making me visible now (at least
as far as third person view is concerned).
