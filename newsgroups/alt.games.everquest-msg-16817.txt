I agree that bards can easily solo caiman and crocks in Oasis due to their
slow attack speed.  They have no loot but awesome xp.  Once you hit 20, you
can go to Lake of Ill Omen which has many groups and many options on what
you can kill until mid to late 20's.  It also has good loot as well as good
xp and a bank in FV close by as long as you stay invis going along the river
to and from the Lake and FV.  Don't mess with the Orcs in Oasis as they will
get you killed and have crappy xp and minor loot.  Stick exclusively to
caiman and crocks (deepwater type in late lvls) and you will lvl quick.
Grouping in Oasis will slow your progress.
