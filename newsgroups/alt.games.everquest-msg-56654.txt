Just wanted to share my first day in EQ with everyone as several people
suggested I let everyone know how things progressed.  Based on all the
fantastic advice I decided to try my luck with a Dwarven Fighter to get a
feel for the game.  I chose the server Tunare because, well oh heck I don't
know why but I did.  At last I was in the magical land of Norath.  I
immediately set out to find my guild leader as specified by a strange note
that was mysteriously planted in my inventory.  Well whoever said to print
out the maps of my home town was a genius but being a male dwarf I said
"Maps, I don't need no stinking maps!".  I was lost within 5 minutes.  Being
a proud dwarf I refused to stop and get directions.  30 minutes and 7
zonings later, (bet you didn't know you needed to zone 7 times to get to the
fighters guild did you ;0) I had found my man, err dwarf.  I had also
learned EQ lesson #1, print some damn maps!

I picked up a few quests on the way out (ok so I got lost again and talked
several thousand dwarfs, see lesson #1 above).  I decided collecting the
shells of the elusive scarab bug sounded fun and after an hour or two of
searching for an exit (we need some neon exit signs) finally zoned outside.
I was immediately greeted by somebody named Osamabinladin yelling for
everyone in the zone to help him level so he could get a cool last name.
Err, ok, I thought, strange way of doing business but I guess he knows what
he is doing.  Within 3 minutes I watched some 12 people laugh and ridicule
Osama.  Lesson #2 learned, don't be an idiot, at least not in the open
public.

I started whacking away at a few bats and snakes having a jolly old time
when a rather large human stopped and proceeded to blast me with buffs.  I
had more spell icons on my screen then I knew what to do with.  I noticed I
was able to run like a grease lightning so I assume I got the wondrous Sprit
of the Wolf spell.  I immediately thanked him for his kindness and he left
without a word.  Lesson #3 learned, good things come to those who shutup and
just have fun playing the game.  I finally find one of those darn rare
scarab beetle fellows and proceed to cleave him in two.  I was rewarded with
a nice shiny scarab carapace.  I killed a few more goblins and hit the magic
and wise level 2!  I figured now was a good of time to camp as any and sadly
logged off to return to normal life.

Bottom line, I had an absolute blast!  Once again I want to thank everyone
who gave me advice in my previous thread.  I am now an EQ Addict!
