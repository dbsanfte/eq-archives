Neither did I say that you did. Hooked on Phonix would be a good
investment for you.

"Rare" is relative. Slapping the name of a singer that's very uncommon
to rare onto a bard clearly implies intended referrence to the singer.
In fact, the owner of the name even admits to intended referrence.

The fact remains that the name "Zappa" is NOT a common name or even
close to it. If the name were on another class, I'd be able to swallow
the "coincidence" excuse. However, the context here makes that excuse
highly unlikely. Context does make a huge difference.
