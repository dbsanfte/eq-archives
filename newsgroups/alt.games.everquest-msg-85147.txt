Heh i've never won a single cc item,  never even seen the hand wraps drop

Prexus is going through this now.... we had rotations for several mobs which
in some players eyes were corrupt (and something player made will never be
totally fair) so one guild broke off from the rotations and went FCFS.
As far as corrupt calendars, we had a lot of rules.. you didn't get a
calendar ID unless you had 25 people 46+, you could only book 1 raid per
month for that plane (i.e 1 poh, and 1 pof a month) you could still go up
with others, but it had to be their guild.. "double dipping" would get your
calendar id removed for a while.

The guild who went FCFS got "sanctioned", they get insulted and abused, and
generally disrespected.  The whole server is FCFS now, but still hard
feelings live on..  that guild is currently the victim of trains and
bullying tactics from other guilds (the so called honourable guilds....)

The rogue i group with daily (its just 2 of us running 4 chars usually) has
a pickpocket skill of about 20, which is pretty honourable of him, maybe
people think rogues have a right to do this, but i think to pickpocket in a
group isn't right

Nah i never have room to hold anything heh.. i had no idea the bangles sold
for so much though, shuriken costs aren't a problem now i can summon my
own.. but for 60 levels they were a sizable cost

Yeah thats what I think it is too.. its hard to know if your hitting or not,
cuz if you throw something and miss, it still usually agros the mob (that
would tend to say its not hitting it, but it doesn't give the "cannot see
this target message" as if the line of sight was blocked

I only buff myself if its me soloing (well me and my cleric)  if the rogue
is on, he plays his cleric and rogue, and i play my wiz (the cleric and wiz
are ungrouped so they don't leach our exp heh)
He symbols my monk and his rogue,  but he loots pretty much everything, so
its all even at the end (if anything, he's up on plat)
