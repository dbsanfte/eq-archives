The freezing is happening on my Compaq too (no snickering please.)  It's not
a RAM or vid card issue, but it seems to not be loading the drivers into the
game.  I am just rebooting my system when this happens and it works fine.
My computer only does this about 25 percent of the time.  I figure that it's
happening to enough people and IF we all report it, verant might actually
work it into a patch.  haha.  right.  Anyway, I think it started with all of
us when PoP went live, even if we didn't install it.

I'm sure this doesn't help, but you people aren't alone in your agony.

later,
