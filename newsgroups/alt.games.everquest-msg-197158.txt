HP Buff?  As a 30 shaman?  Inner Fire capped out at 20 hp.  No, I'm not
bothering with that.  Stamina Buff?  This gives me about 6 extra HP.  Nope, not
bothering with that.

Further, Str, Dex, Charisma have very little noticable effect on combat, I don't
keep those up either.

GHeal is good for up to 300 hp for 150 mana.  Regeneration is good for 5 hp per
tic for 30 tics, thats 450 hp for 100 mana.  2 to 1 versus 4.5 to 1.  Thus far
in most fights I can rely on troll regen plus CIC plus Bear form plus
Regeneration to avoid casting a Healing spell at all.  But I keep GHeal memmed
because despite its inferior ratio, its instantaneous nature means that if I'm
falling behind (my HP is dropping faster than that of my prey) I can waste the
mana to get back ahead; this  is cheaper than rooting, backing off,and waiting
for regen to put me back in the lead, as I keep having to reapply root.

I suspect in the long run regen will be less and less a factor in mid fight, and
it will get to where I'll see it drop, sigh, and not reapply it till after the
fight is over.  Seems to me it (or its upgrades) is always going to be more mana
efficient in the long run than healing, but it won't necessarily be the best use
of time and spell slot to keep it memmed.

Currently Meleeing is a pretty efficient DOT for me; I think (without parsing)
that about 50% of the damage I do to a mob is in the form of melee.  On blue
mobs, the only mana this costs me is regen and quickness and slow... hmm, its
actually probably costing me more than I was thinking.  If I forwent melee, I
might get away with casting nothing but roots and dots, and I could have more
dots memmed.

Of course in a few more levels I get dog-dog, which will, it seems, give a
substantial boost to my melee output, but I'll have to melee myself to make this
work as the pet can't tank efficiently.  I see shaman meleeing all the way up
into their low 60s at least (haven't really grouped with 65 shaman much) so it
seems to me that melee continues to be at least moderately useful as part of
their plan; can't speak from direct experience, perhaps they are being foolish.
