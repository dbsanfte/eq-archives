Its always nice to hear from someone who likes
Fergal Keane, and appreciates him as a reliable
reporter of the facts.

I particularly like his Panorama piece which
documents Ariel Sharon's role in the massacre of
Palestinian civilians, don't you?

Have you read this;
http://argument.independent.co.uk/regular_columnists/fergal_keane/story.jsp?story=284389

Here are a few excerpts;

"...George Bush looks like a bumbler.."

"...There were signs of Mr Bush's weakness long
before the 11 September crisis. The hesitancy of
his initial response when the Chinese seized a US
spy plane in the early months of the
administration was an example. That incident was
resolved because the wiser minds in the
administration, like Colin Powell, persuaded Mr
Bush to ignore the hard right which seeks to turn
every encounter with the Chinese into the opening
battle of a new Cold War. But the bogeymen of the
right were not defeated. The likes of Richard
Perle and Paul Wolfowitz bided their time. In the
wake of 11 September they have become an
increasingly powerful force in the White House.
The sorry fact is that most of this bunch haven't
had an original political idea since Nixon sat in
the White House.

And they are dealing with a President who has no
real ideas of his own. Certainly he has instincts
but they are a poor substitute for strategic
intelligence. The President's politics are so
fundamentally immature that when confronted with a
real world of hard choices he is floundering. So
George Bush ends up caught in the crossfire
between the wise � Colin Powell and Condoleeza
Rice � and the dangerous � Donald Rumsfeld, Paul
Wolfowitz and Richard Perle.

The latter are an arrogant, angry crew and God
help us all if they triumph. It was their
influence, and the siren voices of right-wing
columnists and talk show hosts, which kept Mr Bush
from intervening in the Middle East, repeating the
mantra that Arafat was a terrorist just like bin
Laden. They peddle the illusion that to secure
America's destiny you simply need to shoot faster
than the other guy. They resemble nothing so much
as a lynch posse from the Old West who see their
quarry on the horizon but fail to notice the miles
of burning desert in between. Bush is the Walter
Burns figure, the hesitant sheriff who says: "Gee
boys I'm not so sure." But he follows them into
the wilderness anyway..."

"...They correctly sense that George Bush is weak.
Lets not forget he was elected without a true
popular mandate so that even if he were a strong
strategist, he would be operating from a position
of weakness..."

"...The tragedy is that the wrong man is sitting
in the White House. It shouldn't be George Bush or
Al Gore either. Step forward, if only, President
Colin Powell..."
