That is a big, and deducedly false assumption.

If *All* his guildmates liked the current method of loot determination 
then the guild wouldn't be experimenting with ways of fixxing the 
problems with it.

Right now they're working out ways of allowing leaves of absence, using 
rpp to buy up your attendance, etc.  All to resolve problems with the 
attendance requirement.

Its my beleif that the problem is the attendance requirement itself 
which I stipulate is unnecessary. It is also directly responsible for 
other problems.

The stated reason for having an attendance requirement is to boost 
attendance. Perhaps it would be more fruitful to look for better ways of 
rewarding (incenting) raid attendance than spending time trying to patch 
up something that isn't really working.

Another key question is "Was the attendance requirement working?" Did it 
  even actually boost attendance significantly or would all the 75%+ 
attendees have attended as much as they did without it? Because if 
that's the case than they're adding layers of policy to fix a policy 
that wasn't really accomplishing anything anyways; except perhaps adding 
a bureaucratic barrier to looting for a couple members, and an 
admistrative pain in the ass for some poor guildie.

Keep it simple, and keep it fair. If guild members are going 'eh' and 
not showing up for raids due to lack of interest then either you're 
planning uninteresting raids or you've got the wrong guild members for 
your light-raid guild or a combination of the two. But its not something 
you can fix with a loot-policy bandage.
