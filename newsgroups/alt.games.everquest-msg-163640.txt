From my many, many (many) fights using Tranquil Staff, my weapon of choice
for a very long time, I discovered that the proc rate was unaffected by
slows.  Which, by observation, makes it appear to proc more when you are
slowed (it doesn't, it just procs more often *per swing* since you are
swinging slower).
