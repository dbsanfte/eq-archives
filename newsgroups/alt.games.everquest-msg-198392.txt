    I imagine that had something to do with the one bard, Worry, posting on
Playerauctions that she would PL anyone's AA's in HoH. Just had to transfer
to her server - Stormhammer. All these fast XP methods do have that flaw
that SOE finds objectionable - you can pair up with someone else and
effectively PL them. The bard was getting 4 to 6 AA's per 30 minute kite, so
that would be 2 or 3 AA's per half hour for someone partnered with her while
she rendered the entire zone unplayable for anyone else.
