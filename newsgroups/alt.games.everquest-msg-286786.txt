Maintenance Update: All SOE services are undergoing maintenance. 
Everything is currently expected to return to normal around 3:30pm pdt. 
The EQ servers will remain unavailable until the overall maintenance is 
completed. Forum access and other services that require login may be 
available before the maintenance is completed, however they will most 
likely continue to experience slow periods due to the heavy traffic. For 
the forums, you may need to relog in to get your forum rank to update 
correctly. We will keep you posted if the complete timeframe is changed.

And now, off to bed for me :)
