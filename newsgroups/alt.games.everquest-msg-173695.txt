Why on earth would you run thru Nek?  West Freeport PoK book is inside
the wall on the south edge of the zone.  You head out (to your right
as you face the book) thru the false wall and continue due west into
EC without ever seeing a guard.  The only problem you might have is
if you have a nightblind character with no light source at all at
night (so go do the Planar Travelers Manual quest in PoK, get a 1ac
2cha Range-slot item that is also a greater light source).  Much
shorter run from WFP book into EC than from Nek book, and very nearly
zero chance of meeting any agro mob (guards might be trained, I
suppose, and there is a rare spawn of a L4 Grey Wolf that hates all
the usual suspects).
