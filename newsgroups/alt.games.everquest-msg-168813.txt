Have I ever told you how much I love you, Jazz? :D

Uh oh, who's that pissed-off necro heading my way?

Seriously, I completely agree.  The computer itself is still only 
'okay', but after my sister's wedding, my parents bought me a beautiful 
new flatscreen monitor to replace the dumpy one I was using (so dark I 
couldn't see until daytime, even with DEs), and gameplay has improved 
immeasurably. (IE, no waiting until daylight to stumble out of Nektulos 
;p)
