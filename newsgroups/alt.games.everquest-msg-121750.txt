You'll MA as a necromancer but have a problem with a cleric MA?  Clerics
have far more AC and HP than similarly twinked out necromancers, if
you can suck up the damage then I'm sure a cleric could do so also.  Root
every incoming mob so the cleric can back off and heal, and you have a
plate wearing MA with a cleric healer handy.  At high levels (say post 44)
cleric tanking ability bogs down, but nobody working derv cutthroats other
than your high level wizard friend should really have any objection to
a cleric MA other than the visceral gut reaction people get when they
see a healer class doing anything other than meditate and heal.

59 cleric and -still- occaisional MA... if you don't think keeping aggro
off a ranger or rogue partner is tough, try it sometime... but there's no
need to root,  whenever I like I stop trying and the mob turns its back
politely to let me heal myself.
