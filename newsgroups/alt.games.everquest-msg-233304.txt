I have a level 34 bard and have been trying to get the hang of swarm
kiting without much luck.. I run in a circle, watch from 3rd person
view, and use AOE dd spells but as soon as I let them get close enough
to be hit by the AOE they hit me for more damage than I'm doing to
them.  I've been trying in Overthere due to the wide open plains but
it doesn't seem to work well.  Anyone have any pointers on how to get
the hang of doing this?  Has it been nerfed or something?  What are
the best zones and type of mobs to do this on around this level?

Any help is greatly appreciated.
