See here it is. You admit what you really want is a different game.
You don't want the same old leveling treadmill that takes forever. You
don't want bats. But you see TCC has nothing to do with that. And
whether TCC goes in or not the basic fundamental aspect of the game
from newbiedom to high level is still bashing on rats, bats and
spiders, even if those mobs change shape and name.  TCC won't affect
that one bit.
