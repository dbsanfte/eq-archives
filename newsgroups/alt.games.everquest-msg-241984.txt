Update to current.. directx 9

Not strictly true. Mention gamecard.

Is this still true?

>2.9    What is Everquest Legends?

I'd shrink this and/or just link to SOEs legends page. Legends isn't a
big part of EQ for the vast majority of players, and its not worth the
space allocated to it.

Update to reflect you do not start with the Tome.

Update to relfect that a GM will probably just toggle you back. I
don't think they've handed out quests in ages...

Just mention it usually costs money and post the link. The dollar
value is ephemeral at best; there are multiple pricing options.

Update: this is a supported feature now.

No tutorial. Just tell them how to make a hotkey. :)

>4.    Glossary of Newsgroup acronyms

Personally I'd strip the typical usenet ones and just leave the EQ
ones. EQ needs enough of its own. Link to a usenet site for the basic
usenet ones. (lol, imho, stfu, ...)

a.g.e
cihys, VAK

chat
omw, inc, brb, brt, lfg, lfa, oom, pc on xx, aa, wts, wtb, nbg, fd,
ht, loh, ks, dps, ft, dkp

spells
kei, c1..c4, PotC,  DD, AE, soe, sow, mgb

Maybe the main zone/camp abbrevs...
BoT, PoT, PoK, PoN, OT, GD, PC, SG, TofS, LOIO,  VP, ToV...

mobs "encounters"
RC, RZ, TT...

games:
AO, AC/2, EQ/2, DAoC, WoW


If you want to be complete... one should really cover the new
features...

tribute, casino, pok books, spires, augments, ...
