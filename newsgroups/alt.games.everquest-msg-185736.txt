I logged back on to a msg telling me I was 'beneath the world' and was
promptly moved to a nearby 'safe' zone.

I petitioned, because I'd lost a few backpacks full of gear.

Last I heard, was this:

[Thu Feb 13 11:23:09 2003] Valbin tells you, 'Hmm..don't see them.  I'll
escalate your petition for a GM.  They will have to reimburse them.'

It's been 3 weeks now...  How long does this take?  Should I petition again,
or should I just wait?  I have no idea what to do about this and so I would
really appreciate any advice you long-time players could give me...
