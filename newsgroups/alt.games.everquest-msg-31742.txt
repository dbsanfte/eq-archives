Would it? It's a stupid name and you cant blag an ounce of role play into it.
Thats like saying a warrior can be 'meathead' or 'bashyourhead' because hes a
warrior.
I really dont see this name in any way shape or form as defensible and those
that are: at least have the decency to halt hiding behind a flimsy standpoint
and admit you just enjoy being argumentative for the sheer sake of it.
