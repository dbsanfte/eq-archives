Hi guys, just had a question about the game I thought someone might know..

Recently, I purchased a copy of PC Zone magazine and installed the full
version of everquest on my PC.  I was wondering if I can use this and pay
monthly just like a regular copy?  I made a payment plan and that seemed to
go fine.  When I tried going back into my account, it still said I was on
the trial from PC Zone.

Also, I bought Shadows of Luclin today, and I have the same concerns about
it.  If I register the expansion using the account I made with the everquest
copy I recieved with PCzone, will that work?
