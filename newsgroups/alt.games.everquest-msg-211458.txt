Not at all.  Pre-50th there's very little difference, twinked or no;
certainly not enough to warrant rejecting a ranger from taking and waiting
for a plate class.  Post 50 is when it changes, drastically.  The thing that
makes a bit of a difference pre-50th is the slightly lower AC on ranger
items vs plate class items.  It's not huge.  Rangers are fine tanks pre-50.
Just learn to adapt to a new role post 50th.
