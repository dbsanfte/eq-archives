Well, right out of the box there were alot of quests that worked.
Maybe not the ones you wanted specifically but alot of people were
questing to their hearts content from day one.

Some quests were broken, others just weren't there.  This is where it
falls under the heading of never done, not just not done.  A game of
this kind should never be done.  Not just new content but bug fixes
and updates to existing pieces.

My take on the response to the OP was to try and give an example of
how games like EQ are not box sets come-as-you-are.  It's almost a
living breathing entity that shifts and changes all the time.  To
expect something the magnitude of EQ to work perfectly out of the box
is just asking for disappointment.  I'm not siding with SOE on things,
just that this is not an easy undertaking and involves alot of people
working on different pieces and trying to bring it all together.  It
IS going to have problems, no matter how much testing is done.  Users
have a way of finding shyte that dev's just don't even think of.

A RL side note, if product vendors can't get their stuff working
perfectly out of the box (mind you, products that companies use in
production environments and use to make lots of money) why in the
world would we expect a game to surpass that?
