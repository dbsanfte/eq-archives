The safest way for a low level character to cross Antonica unaided is a bit
counterintuitive...

Take the boat from Qeynos to Odus, go into the Toxulia Forest to
the wizard spires there.  Get a shard from the Scion, wait (up to 15 minutes)
for the Mystic Voice to port you up to Nexus.  Now go to the
Faydwer spires in Nexus and wait some more (usually three minutes
after port up) to port back down to GFay.  Go in to Butcherblock,
catch the boat to Freeport at the docks.

The Antonica nexus spire is in North Karana, far from anywhere
safe for a lowbie, but the Tox and Butcherblock (closest thing
to dangerous you sill find on my suggested route) are populated
with relatively low level stuff that is fairly easily avoided.

Your alternative, if you'd rather walk, would be

Qeynos Hills
West Karana
North Karana
South Karana
Lake Rathe
Rathe Mountains
Feerrot
Innothule Swamp
South Ro
Oasis
North Ro
Freeport

this can, with a little luck and some care, be safely done
at very low levels, far more so than the northern route thru
Highhold Pass.

Either way you try it, strip down to naked and put everything
you care about in the bank before you start out, so that a
death merely costs you the distance you covered since your
last bind.  Another good thing about my plan is that binds
are readily available from NPCs along the route: Odus,
Shadohhaven (little detour from Nexus) Felwithe (detour from
GFay, Kaladim (detour from Butcherblock) all have the
new Soulbinder NPCs in them.

You could bind along the land route in NK, Arena (off LRathe)
and even Ogguk (off Feerrot) and Grob (off Innothule)
but this will reguire the help of others, so its not a "do it youself"
plan, and if you wanted a route that required help you'd have
arranged a port from Qeynos to West Commonlands.
