I'm not surprised, and I think that may be a characteristic many in this 
  ng share, that the "eq community" and the "comfort of EQ" are worth 
more than a technically and mechanically superior game.

The 'web boards' are less like this, and its interesting to ponder if 
there is a commonality that leads people who use usenet to be people who 
are more loyal to EQ&community and people who use web-boards to be 
people who are more predisposed to be champing at the bit for the next 
title. (I guess the people who frequent both are just lost :p )
