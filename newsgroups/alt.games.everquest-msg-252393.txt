This sort of thing is human nature. From Robin Hood to John Dillinger,
people have cheered on what would technically be criminals when they
stuck it to "the man". While the law may be meant to protect everyone
equally, in general people have less sympathy for those they consider
criminals in spirit, such as plat sellers or the banks that were
repossessing farmer's farms during the depression.
