True.  Also worth pointing out is that the fact of our control over our
environment does not in any way preclude our environment from exerting
evolutionary pressures on us, it simply means that we are responsible
for those pressures ourselves.

I am amused by how the word wisdom, which is often used where the
context makes clear that the quality referred to is what we moderns
call knowledge, acquired over time connotations of sensibility and
(dare I say it) goodness.  Those connotations lead me to read your
statement as:
"Let us hope that at some point, the evolution and growth of our
[good sense] catches up with that of our [cleverness]."
Sadly though, your argument would make this reading of your statement
of no greater value than any other.  After all, regardless of the
"goodness" bit, the meaning of "wisdom" depends on subjective values
and so no interpretation of your words, including your own, can have
any universally recognized precedence over any other.
