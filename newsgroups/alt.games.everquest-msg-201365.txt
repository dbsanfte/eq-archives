Sorry to piggy back Ed, I didn't see David's original post, and I
really disagree with it.  The information we got on the eqbards
mailing list from a person involved all through beta, closely connected
with people at VI and a future producer on an expansion (SoL I think)
was that bards were balanced around twisting.  Eliminating twisting
would have been simplicity itself back in beta - reduce the duration
of a song to the time it takes for it to pulse again (plus a small
fudge factor, say 1 second) - bingo, the overlap on switching 
songs is a second, no way to keep multiple effects going.

This is a question I can't wait to see answered.
