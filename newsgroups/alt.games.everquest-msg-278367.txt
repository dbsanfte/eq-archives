Installation of the software requires agreeing to the EULA, unless
you've hacked the install files, which is a violation in itself. If
tested in court, the most likely outcome is that since the software
cannot NORMALLY be used without agreeing to the EULA, it's assumed
that you agreed to it by using it.
