It seems a reasonable position. But consider the omnipotent paradox of
proving true=false in propositional logic using the traditional axioms
and modus ponens. 

propositional logic *is* limited. that's why its useful. there are no
'tricks' you can use like advanced science or a more complete
understanding of the universe to enable you to solve this problem.

The logic has a language of a dozen symbols, strict rules about how
they can be ordered, and strict rules about what you can right on each
line of a proof, in what order.

Then we proved by exhaustive  induction that using those symbols and
rules there is no way to write a proof of true=false. 

Its a toy problem. Its a closed problem. Its a problem humans *fully*
understand. A god doesn't have anything at its disposal that we do not
for this test. He is required to provide a finite sequence of lines
containing sequences of properly ordered symbols that meet the rules
of the logic, because nothing else is a proof. No such sequence
exists.

Its a defining characteristic of the logic that the proof doesn't
exist. I can't give you one, Einstein can't give you one, and God
can't give you one. But its hardly proof there is no god.
