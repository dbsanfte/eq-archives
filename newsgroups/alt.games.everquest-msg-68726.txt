Pet Peeve: druids who wait to long to heal. druids who do not know when their buffs
are running off of the group members they are supporting, etc.

You all are doing an injustice by steriotyping all rangers into a catagory of bad
players just as I was doing with the above statement on druids. Fact is that a lot
of players who think that rangers are not snaring are the ones who do not tust their
group mates to do their job. Furthermore, they are also the ones that would complain
about the ranger having achieved to much aggro should they snare to soon. In this
day with the shift of rangers our of the role of tank, a ranger needs to manage
his/her agro. Snaring at the beginning of the fight is the best way to fail at Agro
Management. Tangle Weeds is a spell that does have the potential of allowing ranger
to do one group function that has always been theirs and still manage their agro.
