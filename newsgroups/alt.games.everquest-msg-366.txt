  It sounds like your computer meets the system requirements just fine. 
I believe the system requirements for the Ruins of Kunark are something
like a Pentium 233 (you're okay there,) 32 mb of RAM (I presume you've
got that, 64 mb is recommended, but you probably have that much also,) a
3D graphics card with 4 mb of RAM... it sounds like you've got that. 
I'm fairly certain that your sound card should work with EverQuest
also.  Windows 98 is fine.  You also need an Internet connection, which
obviously you have if you're posting here (ping times are what matter
most here... unless you have a satellite connection, you're probably
okay.)
  You probably will be able to play EverQuest with decent performance,
depending on how much RAM you've got.

  A graphics card with the TNT2 graphics chipset would probably be good.
  For the record, I have a Pentium II 350 w/ 64 mb of RAM, a 16 mb
VooDoo3 3000 graphics card, a Turtle Beach Montego a3dxstream sound
card, and a 56k modem and EQ runs fine for me.
