Wha? No. I thought I was rather clear .... my comments were based on the
context of *this* thread's roots and the ideas expressed therein, no other.
Obviously, the guy's posting history indicates an overall attitude far
removed from that of the 60s. But I'm not talking about the guy's posting
history, I'm commenting on what Anthony thought Satan sounded like in this
thread, and while I do not wholly agree with Anthony and the image of a
hippie did not spring to mind from Satan's post, I understand where he saw
what he saw.

Knowing Satan's past posting does not change my thoughts on his comments in
*this thread* ... So no, I don't "know better."

Nobody is trying to give you a lesson, Biz. Sheesh. Anyway, this is a
subject I have little inclination to pursue. Your comments are duly noted.
