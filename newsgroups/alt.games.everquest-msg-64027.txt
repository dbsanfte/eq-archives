I am very happy with the customer service I've recieved in my 2 years of
playing. Then again, I'm not very good at whining and tend to logically
think through any problems that arise before /petitioning. If you're talking
about Technical/Administrative support, I've had no problems with them that
I haven't had with any other service/product provider. Nothing and no one is
perfect.

Ummm. No. I was a Sys Admin on a 24/7 service website (not gaming, but
similar). We had annual and semi-annual flat fees. Most (if not all)
internet-based service providers use a flat-fee subscription structure).

Please post a list of improvements that Verant could make. I hear plenty of
complaining, but see no solutions being offered.

My motto "If there is no solution, then there is no problem" applies here.

I don't think Verant loses customers to poor customer service. EXCEPT maybe
those that are the bane of Help Desks everywhere and shouldn't be allowed to
own a computer let alone operate one. Your last paragraph illustrates the
fact that intelligent, well meaning people can sometimes let errors slip
through. I don't expect you to hire a staff of proof-readers, and I don't
expect Verant to cater to those that think quantity (uptime) is more
important than quality (improvements, patches, etc)

BTW I am not a VAK. I'm just a Sys Admin who is sick of whiny users who
complain their Internet connection is down until I come over and plug in
their network cable for them. I also feel that much of the dissatisfaction
comes from the fact that Verant is made up of game developers and engineers.
Trying to mesh their 'vision' with 400,000 anonymous 'visions' can't be very
easy. I think they are doing an admirable job laying the groundwork for this
relatively new industry.
