READERS' LETTERS 

July 7, 2002 


In response to a story in Currents on June 23 on what is overrated and
underrated in society, here's what readers wrote:


[snip]

My suggestion for an underrated person is Howard Stern.

Why? Well, when the 9/11 terrorist attacks happened, I first heard
about it while listening to Howard Stern's show (the local radio
station 105.3 went and started carrying him live when the attacks
happened, instead of the normal two-hour tape delay). He and the rest
of the people on his show did a great job of covering the tragedy,
with Stern playing it straight and airing calls from listeners and
people who were near the area of the World Trade Center.

(Stern also set up an 800 number for listeners to call and make
donations for a fund to help the families of victims, which raised
more than $2 million.)

People make a big deal when Stern does something on the air that
offends them, but when he does something praiseworthy it often gets
little attention.

====================

They trimmed some of my letter, where I mentioned that everyone made a
big fuss about Jay Leno and David Letterman taking "only" a week off
and about how it meant "America was finally coming back to normal",
while Howard was on the air all the rest of the week immediately after
the attacks without taking a day off and didn't get any credit for
that; not a real big deal, though!
