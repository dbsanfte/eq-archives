On this note and what some have already contributed to in just this thread.

BIOS upgrades and Motherboard upgrades (ie.  Award, AMI, etc.. then for Mobo
CPU to PCI, CPU to AGP, etc), check for them and use them.  Chipset's on the
motherboard are also a large part of the performance/problem as well.
Personally, I like the VIA chipsets over the Inetl when it comes to gaming.
I would go with nothing else actually.  Check for updates on your
motherboard.  You can have a fast processor and a lot of fast ram.. though,
just how efficiently that data is transferred to/from ram to/from processor
depends on the chipset, motherboard in general and whether or not your
BIOS/Mobo drivers are updated.

I recently ran a BIOS upgrade and updated drivers for my Mobo (this done
right before slapping in the new processor, more ram and better video card
which happened just yesterday).  It made a noticeable different.. I didnt
say drastic, but, noticeable.

Give it a try, doesn't hurt much to be updated.  Be careful with the BIOS
upgrade, which usually takes only a few seconds to do.. but be sure your
power isn't going to go down during the process.  And incase you run into
compatiability problems after you upgraded your BIOS, you should choose to
save your existing BIOS onto the floppy you'll be using to upgrade it.

Anyway.. worth a shot I guess.  Good luck to ya.
