Because SOE wants to have as many broken stuff to try and drive
players away from EQ so they could shut them down and concentrate on
other money makers

The requirement has not changed.  Supposedly when you select a
particular AA, it will show if it requires certain expansion or
previous AA first.

The requirement is NOT changing other than you no longer need to spend
6 in general, 12 in architype.  Those are old and have been dropped.
All other including cost per rank is the same as before.  So if you
need 3, 6, 9 for the first 3 ranks, and 5 each in another expansion
for 3 more rank of the same line, it will still be 3, 6, 9, 5, 5, and
5

Me too.  Helps me quickly check if new item is an upgrade without
having to deduct the aug boost from my old gear first.

RZ is still hard to do for most peep mainly because of the adds.

Aame here.  I just spent a bunch of AA to boost healing from lifetap
procs.  As a beastlord, I loved getting 640 heal from a single 125 tap
but if that's been nerfed I guess I'll remove deepsky and sell the
death's maw as it won't be effective enough anymore.

Noticed that too.  I posted over at EQTraders.com about this but I bet
many have pointed this out at EQLive forum on Sony.

No idea, just guessing difference in cost for hypericum and wormwood.
I do know wormwood is expensive.

Since the patch about a month ago to "fix" bard, I've fizzled more
than usual.  My Divination skill is maxed at 300+, yet low level invis
fizzled 6 times in a row once.

This will also help a lot on Antonica server where instanced zone
sometimes won't load so no GH for them.

Never noticed either.

Major help there.  If you did /w while casting spell, you get stuck
waiting for the spell to finish plus I get interrupt for taking too
long to finish.  If I do it during combat, I get a lag spike
appearance.

Never noticed that but then again when I needed to retire old aug,
class 1 ans 2 were cheaper.  (Old LDoN augs)

No idea but guessing that refers to /corpsedrag command.

About time.  I always end up naked because Vah Shir was especially
bugged to show nOOb style armor after illusion.

I did notice it.  For example you have a stack of 100 blue diamond for
sale, you click SET button without changing the price, bazaar search
will show you having 200 blue diamonds.  When your stack of 100 do
sell out, buyer get "item no longer available" message even though the
other 100 still shows up.  I've used this to mess with people's mind
by showing multiple identical LORE items at once.  But not much use
and only annoys buyer.

Ditto.

Maybe they'd remove the link all in your own corpse after many
complains of massive spamming in OOC in GL from players.

Never noticed this.

But it'd mean I have no way of knowing if my wireless mouse needs to
