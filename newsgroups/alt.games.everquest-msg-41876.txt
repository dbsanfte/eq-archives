Ok .. I'm not looking for a 'make plat fast' BS guide, telling lvl 5's
they can make 1000 pp per day. I'd like to know where a level 39 Shaman
could make some money in a regular way. Should I:

1) Opt for something like Hill Giants in Rathe?
   I guess at lvl 39, a shaman should be able to root/dot kite them?
   I still remember them breaking root often, I can't snare and they
   hit me real hard .. so .. It's also overcamped.

2) Some tradeskill? I guess none offers something real. I could start
   Alchemy and try selling SoW potions. Does that make money?

3) A camp spot that occasionally drops midrange items worth a few
   hundred plat? If so, where?

All solutions should be normal things for my Shaman character .. if
it doesn't make thousands of plat in a day, fine. Just something to
make reasonable money at all. The best would be if I could even
level a bit off it :)
