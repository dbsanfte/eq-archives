It is something you can do in any zone, at any level. However, unless 
you -need- a raid, there's not much point to them.

However, its required to win against much of the highlevel content. 
Worse, its -required- to get flagged for various zones, to get various 
keys, etc. So if you aren't in a guild that is willing/capable of 
getting you flagged/keyed you have to lead an open raid... and depending 
on your play availability and play time you may find it exceedingly 
difficult to find an accomodating guild, or even enough willing 
competent players for an open raid...

Its a serious flaw in EQ in my opinion. That there are encounters you 
need a large group to win against doesn't bother me. There should be 
challenges that cater to that sort of demand. That there are encounters 
you can solo, but need a large group to unlock access to however is just 
silly.

Non-guilded, soloers, casual players, and night owls are already 2nd 
class citizens in EQ, but locking them out of huge chunks of game they 
could play and enjoy and profit in is unfair. The game needs to cater to 
them too.
