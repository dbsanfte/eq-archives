I can't claim to be any kind of expert on the subject, but it does
seem like the best answer is "whatever class/race you ENJOY playing."

I've heard that Magicians, Necromancers, Druids, Bards, and
Beastmasters are excellent soloists -- meaning they don't absolutely
NEED groups to advance to decent levels, but I suspect all classes and
races have their strengths that, if played to, will work out just
fine.

I've been playing for almost three weeks now, and I like ALL the
options, although I haven't tried them all yet.  Druids seem to level
very well, and Halflings have bonuses to their XP AND a place to
advance to at least level 12 right in their newbie area of Misty
Thicket.  I want to try a Necromancer, but right now the city of
Neriak's layout is a bit daunting.

It all comes down to what appeals to you.  Do you want to fight
(melee) a lot, or do you prefer spells?  A mix of the two (maybe a
hybrid class)?  Read up on this newsgroup and some of the
messageboards, and see what jumps out at you.

Enjoy!

Take it and run.
