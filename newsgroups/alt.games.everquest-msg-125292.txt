}results they desire.

It is generally hard, I would imagine, to convince church leaders that you 
really ought to spend, say,  a quarter million dollars on an electron 
microscope, when they could build a whole nother church in a new town for 
that, and expand their congregation.  Especially since you only want the 
microscope to confirm what is already known from the Biblical sources.  
That doesn't extend their knowledge any.  What's the point?  Sorry, no, 
we're funding the missionary field trip to Peru instead.

And the EM is -cheap-...  My dad's arranging funding for a humongous 
telescope.  He'd spend that just on the proof-of-concept model.
