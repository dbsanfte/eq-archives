Yow, am I the only mage who doesnt chain pets for every mob? The initial
changes to The Grey hurt me a lot, although I could still kill things, I
certainly wasnt doing as well. Havent tried it again since they re-retuned
it. Originally it was great - pull with Scars, 2 Shocks of Steel, and maybe
another Scars to finish it off, while my beefy earth pet beat it up. Could
easily kill 2 Iksar Slaves before I had to med to fom again, was nice xp.
After they 'fixed' it, my earth pet landed 1 in 10 roots, and if my spells
hit, they did only 10% damage most of the time. Fire nukes were a little
better, but not much. I could still solo there, but decided the risk was now
too high, so I ran off. It might be better now though. And no adds or
surprise mobs. As far as I can there are no roamers (except from trains),
and traps are easy to see. Well, I dont think you can see the ones in the
rocks, but its not hard to walk around the rocks...

Whew, that was an awfully long post about not much. :)
