Personal preference.  I enjoy xp camps in EQ, didn't enjoy XP camps in
DAoC.  Didn't like the types of mobs.  Didn't like the way AI worked.
Didn't like the lack of new toys when you finally did level.

Agree.  But I still saw "griefers" doing as much as the system would
allow to piss off their enemy before killing them.

I had as much downtime as EQ, but more from traveling than from
medding/healing.  A good XP group in EQ has zero downtime as well.

no comment

Again, matter of opinion. Before luclin, I thought mob and character
models looked better in EQ than DAoC.  After luclin, EQ wins on both
in my opinion.

Never got to find out.  Made it to level 22 before the free month ran
out, and missed the few opportunities I had to RVR with my guild. 

I just didn't feel like paying for the game so I could spend a couple
more months XPing, so I'd be high enough level to try RVR to see if I
liked it.
