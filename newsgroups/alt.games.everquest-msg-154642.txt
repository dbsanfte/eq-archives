Usedta do customer service for DirecTV. People just couldn't get it
through their heads that they BOUGHT their satellite receiver and
dish. Repairs were THEIR responsibility. All DirecTV covers is the
signal carrying the programming, not YOUR damn equipment. Yanno, it's
about like expecting the gas station to pay for repairs on your car...
Or your ISP to pay to repair your computer.
