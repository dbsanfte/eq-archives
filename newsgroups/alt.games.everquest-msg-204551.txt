You are likely right, and I was speaking of snare class spells in general,
not snare
 specifically, but when you're right you're right, and you definatly very
likely right.

I certainly don't want to slow my charmie as that means my haste wouldn't
stick ^_^.

Best charm group I've ever had was 2 enchanters and a druid. 3 hasted,
tashed, slowed charmies = sweetness

I'm not absolutely certain, but I think my level 55 pet has fewer hp and
less ac than I do.
Soloing with the pet consists of a basic pattern:
Use berserk str/DA buff on pet (can't remember the line name atm)
Use feedback on pet
Use best haste on pet
Make sure pet has second weapon (rusty daggers are your friend)
Pull with tash, slow, root, walk up, get hit, back off.
Drop right clicky 5 point ring dot on mob to get 100% xp.
berserk pet every few seconds to keep it alive.
loot, sit down to regen most of your mana. (or stand there on your horse and
regen half your mana.)
You have no control over your pet. You can't make it attack, back off, sit,
stand, anything. It follows you everywhere, and  attacks anything that
damages it or you.

Enchanter pets do decent damage (about the same as the same leveled puppy I
think), but are made of tissue paper.  They aren't fast enough to fear kite
with without snare, and If I'm duoing with a snarer, I'd much rather be my
charming self.

The big iffy for charming is of course the random duration. Add to that the
random duration of root, and it gets tough.

Problems: AE Mez: Short duration, level capped around the same thing Dazzle
is capped on (50?). But would be useful except.. unless you have a snared
target, both mobs will be on top of you by the time you cast the spell. And
even at 150+ MR, I find I mez myself 30% of the time. It's better to just
recharm and resend.
AE stun: Lifesaver here. But still you are going to have to channel that
charm against 2 mobs beating on you for the last second or two of casting,
as no stun lasts long enough to recast the appropriate charm.
Add to that half the time I seem to be charm soloing stun proof mobs...
(giants, for example) well you get the picture.

Standard charm solo:

Tash pet, charm pet
Haste pet if you want to kill in a hurry. Danger Danger!
Tash target, root target, send pet, slow target, feedback pet since you have
time.
keep pet targeted, except to refresh root. You need to be using the long
lasting root line. (the slower casting ones)
Back off to what is near max charm range
on charm break, recast charm, switch targets, /pet attack.
on simultaneous root/charm break, try anyway, expect to die. (unless you
have jboots or are sowed)

I'm not sure how the charm xp nerf worked (I think I played 3 times since
they put it in) but the old school way of dealing with
pets eating xp was:
Wait till mob gets very low, so you can nuke it dead. AE memblur, followed
by your nuke. Now you did 'most' of the damage to the mob, and get the full
xp.
