The catch is that the bloodstained tunic is chain, and thus not
wearable by druids.

One drop I haven't seen listed so far is gatorscale leggings (4 wis)
from Upper Guk. The ancient crocodile is level 30, the placeholders
somewhat lower, so you might want to get a few more levels under your
belt (the 34 dot helps a lot). I did it easily at 36.

You should also be able to get a 3 wis gold jasper earring for a
pittance from a jeweler.
