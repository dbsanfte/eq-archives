Roughly what do these go for you your various servers, if you've seen
them for sale. We came up with an extra set that our Cleric has, and if
we can't find somebody in either of our guilds who needs them for a 1HS
slot, she'll probably sell them. EQprices is totally unreliable anymore,
so I'm wondering what's typical? The kokiak claws are a pretty crappy
weapon, but icetooth's aren't too bad of a ratio so I'm wondering if
they're worth a few shekles.
