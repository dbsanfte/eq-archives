Well, like I'm saying, I really don't know if it's that simple, but
even if it is, changing it would mean recompiling the entire map and
then the whole zone file would need to be included in the patch,
making the patch considerably bigger. Maybe that's a consideration,
especially since the weird wall isn't really much of a bug.
