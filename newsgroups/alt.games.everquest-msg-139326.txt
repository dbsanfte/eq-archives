Pets in a group will never take exp, unless a very very odd circumstance
is happening.  Your group need do only a single point of damage to
a target in order to get 100% of the exp.  If each pet in your dream
group goes after its own target, and not one of you lifts a finger to
do a single solitary point (other than DS) then you'll take a major
exp hit (I;m unclear whether its 25% or 75%) but the chances of this
happening without you doing it deliberately are slim.  Even if you
all refuse to do anything and let pets do all the work, if more than
one pet hits the target for damage, then you STILL get 100% of the
experience!
