	I had stopped at 60 to finish the Archery AAs, because the PoP funnel was
in effect at the time and it was easier to get the AAs soloing than spending
hours LFGing.  I was 62 when the public raid leader moved the cap to 64.  I
did not have hours of RL time to spend every day LFGing and grinding, so by
the time I closed in on 64 the cap was raised to 65.  By that time I was
hopelessly behind on flags (Valor/Storms and Honor only) and backflagging was
already becoming a depricated activity, so I just gave up trying to catch up.

	It's a shame -- the E'ci public raid force is elemental now and has
reasonable expectations of getting into Time -- but c'est la guerre.
