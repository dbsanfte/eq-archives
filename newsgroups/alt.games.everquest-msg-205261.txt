I will be the very first to admit that the Drinal flame boards suck.  It's
mostly populated by people who no longer play the game who like to discuss
politics.  It might have been a good thing once, but most people who still
play the game wandered away, bored to death of the endless political flames,
until it's hardly worthy of attention.

The best flame, in my opinion, is the one started by Cats in Hats over the
Emperor Ssra incident, during which a GM came and involuntarily TL'd CiH out
of the zone.  That thing went on for many many pages with lots of flaming by
both them and us.  One of the CiH flamers then decided to try and get
sympathy by flaming the GM on the Fires of Heaven guild boards, of all
places.  He got promptly flamed to death by the FoH regulars, and his post
now resides in the FoH Retard Rickshaw.  We, of course, had a great time
jeering him and his guild over that.

Man, good times.

These days it's barely alive.  To tell the truth, I was hoping this incident
would revive it a little, but there's been almost no movement.  A shame,
really.

I think it shows what a difference active moderation makes.  I've been to
other server's flame boards, and the ones that have active participation are
the ones that have active moderation (or the other way around).  Had I been
the moderator, I would have created a separate forum and dumped all the
political flames there.

All this makes me long for drinal.net boards, which were much more
interesting and useful until GameRealm nerfed them out of existence.  I find
myself regularly perusing other server's flame boards to keep myself
entertained.  Man, Sephrok got pwned good.  Did Ravenark succeed in getting
him banned?
