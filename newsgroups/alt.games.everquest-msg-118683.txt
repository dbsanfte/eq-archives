To be fair, Java *does* offer more than just "platform independence".
Writing a program in Java that will target just one OS is justifiable.

For the record, I'm primarily a C programmer, but I've done fairly
large projects in C++ and Java, too.

My experience is that C is too low level, and average programmers
tend to make too many mistakes in it.  It's inappropriate for most
of the uses it's put to, and lacks such constructs as linked lists,
dynamic arrays, "real" strings, etc.

My experience is that C++ is too complex, and average programmers
don't even remotely grasp the language.  They learn how to use a
certain subset of the language and stick to that (and don't
necessarily use that subset correctly, either).

My experience is that Java is over-hyped, but it *is* a nice
evolutionary step beyond C and C++; however, I think it has plenty
of problems of it's own.
