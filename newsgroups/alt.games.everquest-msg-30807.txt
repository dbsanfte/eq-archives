 I'm sorry... but I am of the opinion that I have experienced far more 
of EQ than the average non-"bluebie". I would guess (based on my own
personal experiences on PvP servers) that the better, more challenging
zones and NPCs such as VP, DN, SG, Kael Velks, ToV, Sky, Hate, Fear,
Naggy, Vox, VS, etc, etc.. are rarely utilized because of the inherent
uncooperative and untrusting nature of PvP servers.
 
 So there.
 
 If you were attepting to insult me you have succeeded, but I don't
relly give a shit about you opinion. Not anymore.
