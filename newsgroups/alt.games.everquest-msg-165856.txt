I'm a casual gamer, and they are not *perfect* for
me, and not *perfect* for a lot of others, I
suspect.

If it were possible for me to be logged on to EQ
as much as you say, then it might well be
*perfect*, but it isn't.

Just as well, that I am one of Bartle's
"explorers" rather than an "achiever", and as
such, I don't really care what equipment I have,
as long as its suitable for the task.

Yes, one of the few places I did camp, was Dyllin,
whom I killed after about 4 months, in this way.
