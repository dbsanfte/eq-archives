LOL, im amazed at your dumbness (especially if u really have an Arch
Convoker), concussion and aggro control is not an issue when quadkiting...
I only use concussion spells if a bigger mob aggros me, apart from that i
dont mem it coz my rune usually keeps me alive until someone aggros it off
me. Its funny listening to an mage trying to tell an uber wizard something
you have no fucking clue about.
