I think Prexus has potentially the most higher end guilds of the original
servers (oldest non-split server)

What we did though.. we decided ST was our target, we killed every first
brood on pop, we got to ST every pop day, about 9am EST (a fair few times,
at 7am est !!)

It just became the norm that our guild would always win the ST race.. it
also meant as long as we didn't slack off too much, most guilds just stopped
bothering to try and race us.

Of course with the new ST plans that I read recently.. that could all change
