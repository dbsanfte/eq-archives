Can be utterly crushed by a lo fifties group with an underequipped L52
Paladin for a tank, I don't think we took over 1k damage between the
five of us, and half of that was damage the Ranger took on the pull.
Just need someone to keep him stunned and someone to hurt him, bet a
mid-50s Paladin with KEI could kill it solo.
