What level are you?

Resurrections return a percentage of the experience lost when you die.
However, if you're under level 11, you don't lose any so you wouldn't
gain any exp back on a rez, just suffer the rez effects (loss of mana,
and loss of stats).

Also, with lower level rez's the amount returned is so low, compared
to how long it takes to make it back (at lower levels) that it's usually
not worth taking the rez, just loot and get back into the fray.
