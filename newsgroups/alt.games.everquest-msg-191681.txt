If you have parsed it out as you say, you are probably right.  I have
always been under the impression that bonus damage and regular damage
are given equal weight.  This then means that depending on the
situation, a higher natural ratio is better.

Any idea about magic damage?  It is subject to the MOBs resists but is
it also treated as base damage or a bonus?
