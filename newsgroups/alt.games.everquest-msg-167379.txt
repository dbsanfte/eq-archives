As "rights" are defined in-game by SOE, and I've not yet encountered
any such "right" published by them anywhere, I'd have to say you're
blowing smoke out your ass once again.  That doesn't make your
theoretical L65 Druid any less lame, however.

*shrug* The last time I stopped in RM (looking for KEI money) all
three of the HGs I killed gave me xp.

"Moderate"? hardly, they're crap xp for the effort required to
kill them.  As to "honestly getting more out of it", how so?
I quite literally ran in for a quick buck the last time I went
to RM, killed a dozen or so PHs and three HGs and then left with
my KEI money.  Seems to me I got a lot more out of my fifteen
minutes there (i.e. I got exactly what I wanted) than all those
whiney wannabe twinkers get out of twenty hours there.

A couple observations:
1) It's amazing how few HG campers can be bothered to kill the PHs,
even when you've got six people racing for every spawn.  I mean,
how much effort is it for an HG hunter to kill a lizardman?
2) If those mid-30s groups are there for the xp, why are they so
often unwilling to kill Cyclopses?  They're nearly the same xp as
an HG and about 10 times easier to kill, AND THEY'RE PHs FOR THE
HGs ferpetesake!  I've been in a couple of those mid-30s groups
and had people whining because I pulled a Cyclops that agro'd me
when I was looking for HGs, how stupid can you get?
