You're both right (or wrong, as the case may be).  Loral, it's simply not true
that Sony can't come up with categories broad enough to cover 51% or more of
the customer base.  It MAY be true that the common stereotypes (high-end 25+
hour/week raider and sub-70 casual) are not a majority.  Faned, arguing this
point as a "you're flat-out wrong" is not very helpful, and not true unless
you define terms more clearly.

My take on the whole argument: nobody "deserves" new content.  SoE makes
business decisions based on what they can produce in a given time for a given
budget, that they think enough people will buy to make it worthwhile.  Players
buy and play if they think it'll be a net positive on their happiness.

The decision Sony makes on what players are willing to buy does NOT boil down
to categorizing every account as one of N buckets, and writing features that
cater to each bucket proportional to it's revenue.  It is (or it would be if I
were King) far more nuanced than that.  They have to guess what will sell in
light of both lying/confused customers (who think they want something and
scream loudly about it, but won't be happy if they actually get it), a large
group of hard-to-categorize customers (former raiders, high-end casual, family
midlevel raiders, etc.), and the fact that there's a lot of crossover and
mobility in the customer base.
