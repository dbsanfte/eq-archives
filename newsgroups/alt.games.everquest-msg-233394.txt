I don't think I've ever been called any of the above.  But if someone suggested
such a thing I would tell them to KMRRA.
That said, I will offer advise, to save the group and my mana:  
1 - Could everyone PLEASE stay at their keyboards?  Ok, I expect more than
that, please be AYK *and* assist the tank when the mob comes in.  When there
are 3 pets standing around not even attempting to join the fight something's
wrong.  (NO! I'm not talking to wizards and enchanters..... duh....)
2 - Could you please ASSIST the tank, not just start wacking at mobs.
3 - As far as being greedy, temperance costs a peridot or 11 plat.  COSTS,
thats not making a profit.  So, if I don't know you, cough up a dot or don't
hail me.  And if I DO know you, don't be a cheapskate.  You aren't my favorite
charity.
4 - Whiny?
I *never* whine.  I don't join a group then complain about the choice of LDON
or loot rules.  Get the hell out!  Find a group more suited to you!  Got a nail
in your shoe?????  Nothing's forcing you to stay.  (But in the future, if
someone joins our group and starts this whiny crap I *am* going to say this, so
be expecting it:  Hey, Owhinyone, there are several other groups looking for
members, you'd probably be happier in one of them, and it will free up a space
in our group for someone who really wants to do this dungeon.
I don't say *I knew this wasn't going to work*.  I don't yell at someone for a
bad pull while I've clearly been AFK for the last 3 mobs.  You know who looks
stupid when you do this?  Need me to tell you?
This does not help:  HEAL EM!!! HEAL EM!!! Nor does HEAL ME!!! HEAL ME!!   I am
at my keyboard.  Every minute of every group, except when I must bio, which I
announce, always under 60 seconds, always at a *good* time, (ie., everyones low
on mana).  This would be like me *shrieking*:  "HIT HARDER! HIT HARDER!  Must I
say *duh* again??? Do you think I need to hear that?  Do *you* need advise on
how to melee a mob mid battle??????????  Do you think it helps to spam the
channel with that?  It doesn't.  It just prevents me from seeing important
messages from the leaders.
Ok, over done with gone.  Thanks for letting me whine Annie :)
