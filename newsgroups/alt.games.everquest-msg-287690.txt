We know shadow priests and enchance shamans, survive hunters have
their positions in the raids. Because they can afford pretty nice
buffs.

Shadows priests to be themana battery, enhance shamans to buff the
rogues, fury warriors and hunters. And the survive hunters can afford
=93ignor armor=94.

It seems that something will be changed because of the group
flexibility:
There are 30 specs but only 25 spots in a raid. The class choice
should be very flexible and the buff/debuff system overhaul was done
to help with that. Cancelling a buff because a class wasn't available
(like Shamans for Bloodlust) was not desirable.

Most buffs now affect the whole raid and multiple classes can give
them, however none of them will stack. You should get more types of
buffs by bringing a fewer number of players and will be able to
optimize them by bringing the right spec but it definitely won't be as
necessary as it was in TBC
