He uses the original vision of Horizons to show presumably how things ought
to be done, but he evidently never realized that that emperor had no
clothes.  David Allen could talk a good game, but he sure didn't produce
anything.  Anyone can talk a good game about how *their* MMORPG will be
different and revolutionary, but if it never gets produced, it's nothing but
hot gas for the fanboys to inhale.  And to then hold it up as an example for
how things could have gone if those dastardly corporate suits hadn't gotten
involved, it's just foolish.  Of course it sounds better than EQ, it never
had to exist in our reality!  I mentioned Dawn for a reason, you know.
Allen was just better at convincing people.

Yes Ben, yes, it *does* invalidate his ideas.

If Sigil does, then what's the complaint?  Have fun with their game when it
comes out, and I mean that earnestly.  I'm not discussing ideas because if
you never advance beyond the ideas stage, you're no better than Dawn.  Maybe
you'd be better at convincing the public that you're serious about it and
you can pull it off, but that's just gravy.  There's no practical difference
between the two.

I mentioned that that was where I stopped reading, because if he's going to
try to diagnose the problems of MMORPGs and provide realistic solutions to
create new types of games that might actually be released it's kind of
incumbent that he recognize that David Allen's Horizons was a load of
bullshit.  He lost all credibility with me there with that assertion,
especially when followed up by the cliche of blaming the corporate suits for
coming in and destroying the vision.  Contrary to what you may believe,
"corporate suits" aren't solely interested in coming in and blanding down
whatever project their company is working on.  They turned Horizons into a
viable, released title from what had previously been fluff fantasy that was
losing every entity that had invested in it a lot of money.

Again, I didn't misread anything.  If the guy wants to be a credible critic,
he needs to do a better job than he did in what I did read.  After that, I'm
not wasting my time listening to him.  If you feel this is my failing, well,
we'll both just have to live with that.

That's a lot of speculation, Ben, and nothing concrete.  Thus this didn't
answer my question.
