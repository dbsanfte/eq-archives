I had some minor computer problems a month ago, and after a full
reinstallation and full patching, I can no longer login.

I get to the login screen fine, I type in my password (username is
remembered), then I click 'connect'...and it hangs. The screen
freezes, I can't exit the game at all, I can't cancel, it doesn't
appear to be connecting, and eventually I have to do a full reboot.

Does anyone have any idea what could be causing this?

My computer specs are P4 2.5GHz, Soundblaster Audigy sound card,
GeForce 4 128MB graphics card, 512MB ram, 50GB remaining hard disk
space, and Windows XP Pro. I was running it on this setup fine before
the problems (in fact, this is an upgrade, so the game was running
wonderfully compared to how it ran on my old P3 500Mhz)

Also, I have all the expansions.
