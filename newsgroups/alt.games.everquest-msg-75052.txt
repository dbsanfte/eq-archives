Hey, I think Verant should make practice ranges, where you can go to work on
your skills. If you have low skills you can go there, and work on them. Say,
my 1hs was average, and my piercing was master. Well, my 1hs needs to be to
par, so i can go there, and start slashing on a dummy, and work on my
skills. It keeps us from waisting skill points on weapon skills, and it lets
us use them for good things
