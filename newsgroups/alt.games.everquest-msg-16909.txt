lol of course there are....a friend of mine on Karanam, definitely not gay,
almost always played females.  He told me he chose to play females because
others wouldn't get so upset with the things he said if they thought he was
a girl...plus guys always would give him stuff.
I am a real life woman, and I can vouch that people are nicer to us girls,
real or otherwise, than they are to other guys. I have never asked anyone
for anything except perhaps a SOW when recovering my corpse.  I have only
asked for a rez for a fellow group member, never myself....but people tend
to do these things for women...and often refusing any offer of payment.  So
it stands to reason many guys might play a woman, just to make life easier
in the long run.
I, myself, have only tried playing a male role once in my life and found I
couldn't roleplay it very well, not having a clue how to be a man.....since
most the mannerisms I have observed men doing are not allowable animations
in the game :)
