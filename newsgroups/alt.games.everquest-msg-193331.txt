Perhaps thats your problem.

If you didn't automaticly see everything as a fight, we could have had an
interesting discussion about the differences between games designed with
online play taking the focus with single player options tacked on, instead
of the other way around...  the existance or non-existance of a trend
towards such in the computer industry, whether such a trend is, or would be,
a good thing.   And wherever that discussion would have led.

Instead, every discussion with you turns into a tedious repetition of .. I'm
not wrong!  I wasn't wrong then, I'm not wrong now!  Stop nitpicking me.

And to be quite honest, it makes it not worth the effort to try and discuss
these things with you.
