Exactly.

I think James said it best...  "Wow, Sony stealth nerfed the mobs this
patch.   They suddenly all lost the ability to summon wizards."


And yes, the very frequent saying was "Raid experience doesn't matter!
We're not here for exp!"  It's what you said, and what you told yourself...
but at least for me, and I suspsect for many more, it was always in the back
of my mind that someone there other than you was just raking in the
experience.  Then there were the people who would rub your nose in it too.
A druid who was put with multiple rogues because he was known to be an
overnuker and poor healer, so they didn't want people taking deaths because
of it. (the rogues wouldn't get aggro and need healing) saying into the raid
channel (after he's been summoned for the 5'th time) "OMG, this is awesome!
I've made a full AA and a half so far."   While you're in the main tank
group, composed of  2 warriors, 3 clerics and a bard.  If your exp is moving
at all, it's going backwards.   Meanwhile this putz is overaggroing, ping
ponging mobs around, making your job 10 times harder than it has to be and
wasting everyone's mana... and he's getting all the rewards, while you're
getting all the penalties.   And some people (not me) would bitch about it
and start fights over it, making everyone pissed off, even if they hadn't
been.

Many, many bad feelings went away just because of the raid exp being added.
Even though it was heavily penalized such that nobody was really getting
anything.  Raids became more streamlined and efficient, and in my opinion,
much more fun.   Even massively nerfed raid exp was the best change ever to
the raiding game, from my point of view.

The group content is designed around 6 people.   If more people could be
added easily and without penalties, they would be.  This would trivialize a
vast portion of the current exp content, which would be a bad thing.  (1)


(1) Yes, I realize that massive mudflation already has trivialized most exp
content for a 6 person group, but thats another issue that should have been
dealt with.  Two wrongs =! right, and all that.
