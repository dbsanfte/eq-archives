I don't know about the rest of Europe, but here in the UK you take out 
insurance against the costs if you lose. This is relatively new, since 
the no-win no-fee arrangement was only allowed quite recently. Before 
that you had to be able to afford to pay your lawyer up front, and take 
the risk of paying the other side's costs if you lost. Alternatively if 
you were poor enough Legal Aid (ie the government) would pay, in certain 
types of case.
Nowadays lawyers are allowed to take on cases for a cut of the winnings, 
nothing if they lose, as in the US. But there is still the risk of 
having to pay the other side's costs, so as I say you usually have to 
stump up a premium to insure against losing. The amount depends on the 
case - the chances of winning, the likely size of costs and so on, so 
there is a significant restraint on frivolous cases. I'm not sure if the 
rules allow the lawyer to fund the insurance, or if the client has to 
come up with that money.
