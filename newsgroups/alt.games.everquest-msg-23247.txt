Going strictly from memory here, agility should be 75, but not for hitting,
so that you don't get an AC penalty.  Dex should be 75 minimum too IFIC,
this is used among other things for hitting I think.  Someone will correct
me if I am wrong.  Don't worry too much about being unable to hit with your
cleric, it will only get worse.  You are destined to be a caster, not a
meleer, so start thinking in those terms.
