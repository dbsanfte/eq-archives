Supposedly this trick still works for the aquagobbies in BB. Evil necros 
wanting faction (assuming they are fairly high level) can park there 
with the pet and get good dorf faction while sleeping. They gobbies 
still attack anything, but don't do enough damage to even keep up with 
your average equipped necro's regen. And the high level pets eat them 
like twinkies.
