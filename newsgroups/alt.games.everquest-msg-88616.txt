No, that won't help. Invis to undead would help to get by your body
but you could not loot it then. 

If /corpse does not work right by the well, see if you can get a
slightly higher level person to drop down with you. I think my druid
did that before after levitating us both then I killed the odd ghoul
nearby and ported the person out after they got the corpse.

Maybe you can find a bored necro or druid to help you out in WC.
