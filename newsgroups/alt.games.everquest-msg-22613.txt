Yes, Iksar are KoS at every city, Prior to faction work.

It would be a major hastle, and I wouldn't attempt it unless I had a pet druid
or wizard around.   Your friends could buy your supplies for you, but you
would be unable to train anything without returning to Cabalis every few
levels.    Another option is to try and get them over to Kunark.   Perhaps
they could bind and train at the evil outpost (not sure what trainers are
there) and hunt in the Iksar newbie areas.   Although you might have to make
runs back to the mainland for spell purchases, and corpse retrieval at lower
levels would be a major pain, having to cross several zones each time.
