In a similar "I thought it was funny but the explanation will kill the joke"
vein, here's how I came up with the name for my first Ranger.  A "Ranger"
would be someone who produces a "Range".  Well, that's what a function
does--it maps a domain onto a range.  And hey, with their good outdoor
skills, Rangers are an obvious choice for exploring and mapping an EQ domain
(a zone).  But naming my Ranger "Function" would be pretty lame, as would be
naming him "Domain" and taking "Mapper" as my last name later...so what is
anothe way to say function?  Well, a function is often considered as a
mapping from a variable X to a variable Y....X onto Y...Xontoy.  My Ranger
was Xontoy.
