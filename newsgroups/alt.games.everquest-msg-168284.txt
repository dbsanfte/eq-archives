Yes. Very hard core laws, enforced by people with guns who speak
little english.

Well, that's just not true. There have been plenty of cases where
travelers paid their money, and didn't get to fly for any number of
reasons, bad weather, terrorism, bankruptcy, etc.

No, but you do pay caterers in advance.

No, but you pay your bus fare in advance. Cab fare would be impossible
to charge in advance, because the charge is based on distance and
travel time. Where I live, there is an airport shuttle service you can
take that charges a flat rate, and those guys take their money in
advance.

Not in California. Most gas stations you pay in advance. Want a
fill-up, and don't know exactly how much that will be? The customary
practice is to give the gas station attendant more money than a full
tank costs, pump your gas, then go get change for the unused part.

That's cause they know where you live, and also because the charge is
tied to usage. Can't very well predict how much electricity you will
use in a month in advance.

In most cases, businesses are free to use whatever method they like
for payments. Fast food restaurants want their money at the same time
that they hand you food, a sit down restaurant generally will let you
eat the product before demanding money. It's all up to the business
management. You are free to take your business elsewhere if you feel
offended because some business didn't trust you. Same goes for porters
in EQ.
