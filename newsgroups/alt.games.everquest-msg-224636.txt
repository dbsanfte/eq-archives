...not that I know of.  However one quicker way is to target the first
person.  (Click on his name or hit F2).  Now just type "/whot".  Hit
F3 or click on the next person's name and then type "/whot" again or
just push Shift+UpArrow to repeat the last command.  Repeat.  This is
really the same thing, just with fewer keystrokes.

Someday I'm sure they will implement a group window much like the raid
window, which reveals all relevant information about all people in a
raid, regardless of their zone and /anon status.
