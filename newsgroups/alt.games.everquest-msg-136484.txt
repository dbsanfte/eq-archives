Now that you mention it, I've seen the same shit but didn't pay that
much mind to it.  But searching by name isn't always a winner either
unless you remember and correctly type in the entire thing. I was
looking to see who was selling Blessed Fishing Rods yesterday... typed
in "Blessed" and got nothing. Typed in "Fishing" and got nothing. Typed
in "rods" and three vendors showed up, along with the various other "Rod
of..." items.

I think the search function is still a bit wanky.
