The Enchanter DS is pretty sad... you really have no need to be weary of it.
The Ranger DSes are also pretty damn pathetic (in comparison to the others,
and also considering I'm only speaking of buffs you can cast on others), and
Mage DSes are nice and all, but it's not like Mages are comparable to
Druids.

I promise you, some where in the world, some Mage is complaining that Druids
get heals -and- DSes.

Druids have the most powerful line of spells in the game. Heals are
completely unresistable, and they always do the same amount (Same with DSes,
oddly enough). Even if a 50 Druid/Shaman cannot heal as much per spell as a
24 Cleric...

Snare is a pretty minor complaint... Shadow Knights have Darkness
(Snare-DOT), and does that mean that SKs make other classes obsolete in that
respect? Not at all. Rangers have Snare, but it doesn't last long. Druids
have Ensnare, which lasts an eternity.

About the evacs, when a group is in serious trouble, the casters are usually
the ones that are beaten into a fine paste. However, Druids usually have
more HPs and AC than Wizards, which helps them get a -successful- evac off.

With buffs, you really have to expect Shaman to be better. That is one of
their primary roles, after all.

Well... you're not a pet class. If you wanted to make speed bumps, you
should have made a Shaman, Magician, Necro, Beastlord, or even a Shadow
Knight.
