I found and killed the brewer many times.  He pops on the lowest level.
After zoneing into BB from QH, take the first door you find on the right.
This takes you down a long ramp to the 3rd level.  You will come to an
intersection with a big bridge to the right and a narrow bridge ahead.  Take
the right.  Standing on the big bridge you see off to the right a large
pool.  The brewer and master brewer spawn next to this pool.  Placeholder is
a gnoll guard. pop is on a 14-15 min or so timer.  Many people told me that
the brewer spawned next to some barrels left of the big bridge but after
14hours plus, never saw one spawn there. They are sometimes camped by
rangers for a quest of their's which require 3!!! of the hard to get cask.
I've seen 9-12 guards in a row before a brewer pops.  I've also seen 6
brewers without a cask dropping.  You can also spend the time running to the
elite gnoll ledge and the elite gnoll "Green room" looking for your gnoll
skins.  My first time there, I got 2 cask before I had got the required 4
gnoll skins. (lucky i found out later). I sold the extra for 50pp before
finding a guildy that wanted one.  Thought "Easy to get, I'll camp another."
doh! 12 hours = no more cask.

The one fun thing about BB was that I was level 22 and "Owned" the dungeon!
Only some elites and gnoll commanders would arrgo and they were easy to
solo.  I also became the newbies best friend as I would derail the trains as
they ran by.  One good drop off of the elites is the spiked (not studded)
collar, str and ac neck slot item that I just now (31) gave away after
getting a Ravenscale neckpiece.
