Oh, how awful!  Whatever shall we do?!  SOE is threatening to add
interesting content that not only doesn't require zerg tactics,
it prohibits them.  We'll be ruined!  How dare they let players
from small guilds have any fun!  We demand that any new content
be modeled slavishly on the old and require hundreds and hundreds
of hours of ultra-boring raid play, no progression is permitted
for anybody who can't do 12 hour raids six days a week!
