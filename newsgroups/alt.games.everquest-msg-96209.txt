That relies too much on unkown others who may or may not be around. I'll
admit it... I'm too much of an instant gratification person. I'd rather
do it myself and not wait around hoping somebody will go buy the stuff
for me.

The goal is 222 smithing. But I'll stop before that if it becomes too
painful to bear. It's for a quest that probably going to take me months
before I get to the stage where I have to smith the stuff, so it's no
rush at this point. The character is a Warrior/Troll/Agnostic, lvl 55. 
My base STR with my gear is in the 150's and I've borrowed enough gear
to amazingly get my WIS to 127.

Last night I hit 117 in smithing doing skewers, then a few pots until I
ran out of metal bits.
