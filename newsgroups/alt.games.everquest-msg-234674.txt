I know by many peoples standards here it's not all that impressive, but, 
last night, I finally fulfilled one of my oldest goals in game, I got my ST 
key, and zoned in, and zoned right back out with 42% health left from the 
train that had been left at the zone.  :b

Got my shard off the statue of RZ, then, after we finally dropped the AoW 
for our first time, headed off to DN with a few others with pieces for the 
key, and we got ourselves keyed.  Ran straight to EW, clicked in, got the 
message that the Sleeper's key has been added to your key ring, and clicked 
right out.
