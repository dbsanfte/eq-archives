Remove platinum and Yantis would be trading peridots, blue diamonds,
tiny coffins, fungi tunics or whatever else was bought with the
platinum before the change.  Seems your idea would lead eventually to
everything being no drop and/or no rent; no one could reimburse a
cleric or chanter for his buffs since eventually all trading would be
impossible.  After clerics left because they couldn't afford to buff
anyone, other players would leave for lack of clerics. Trading needs
to be easy for the game to be fun.

As long as trading is easy for players, someone will be trading, and
also the temptation will be there to get paid in real life for having
in the game an item to trade.  

Lots of things are illegal to sell IRL, but it doesn't stop people
from selling those things (e.g.: items made from endangered species,
sexual favors, certain drugs, state secrets, stolen items, certain
types of pornography, certain weapons, lottery tickets, murder for
hire, etc.).  One can argue that some of the items are not illegal in
other countries or that morally one is not bound by that law or that
the law won't go to trial because of some economic reason. Bottom
line, in the game and in real life there will be an underground
market. One can only refrain from participating in such trade and
praise those that help stamp out such abuse.
