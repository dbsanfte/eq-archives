Ah, thanks for the info.  So it was not stupid to hope.  Now if only the
darned thing would drop.

To be honest, I know much less than I should about melee issues - haste,
damage/delay, hate management, etc.  Clearly I need to get a warrior up to
60 just so I can get familiar with this stuff.  If only I could find the
time.   =)

How Rampage gets dealt out is a mystery to me.  We had one tank designated
to be the Rampage Tank, but he only got about half the Rampages.  The rest
were spread between two other folks that quickly became one other person
when the second guy didn't tell us he was on Rampage.  And a ranger in my
group got Rampaged once, then never again.  Exactly why Rampage kept
ping-ponging about is beyond my ken.  I just waited for someone to scream
"PAGE" and then healed them.  =)

> Also, have you guys killed Arch Lich?

Aye.  We've killed everything in Ssra except Blood / Emp.  We have
sufficient keys but very few bane weapons - it's annoying how rarely the ore
drops.  My guild is closely allied with another guild - we always raid
together - and we're the only ones killing boss mobs in Ssra.  Drinal's
resident uber-guild is busy doing Vex Thal and no one else has yet tried.
Our most recent achievement was Cursed, which took us several attempts
before we got the strategy down.

To be honest, I kinda regret skipping NToV... I went from a guild that did
the occasional HoT raid to a guild that farms Ssra.  I'd've liked to see
some of those bad ol' dragons deep in NToV.

Thanks.  =)
