Using a low aggro spell like Malisement, you can single pull them
at 51, maybe at 50.  For each pair, pull the right one first.

Only 6 of them in the entry way.
The hallway has 1 roamer Elemental crusader
they can pull, then a Crusader/Warrior pair
at the end of that hallway that is almost
impossible to single pull.  With that pair,
they aren't even going to be able to touch
the Rock Golem/Crusader pair on the bridge.

Spawn time is 21 minutes - live by it, if
you're fighting something in the entry
when they pop you're in for it :)

You want to pull from over the ledge before you try pulling that
locked door - even a 56th ranger or pally pulls a minimum of 1
Rock (51+ and summons) and one crusader.  Any character lower
than that is going to get 3.

With a decently ranged spell however, the puller can pull Flightys
and crusaders from the Courtyard without going over the edge.

Saw 4 pairs of IGS drop from Rocks down there while leveling (51-55).
I started by soloing the entry, but showed it to my guild, and we
used to try to kill the 11 top mobs as fast as possible to allow for
as many pulls from the CY as possible before the 21 minutes was up.

A 51 mage can easily handle 4 per spawn cycle, I could go through
all 6, but not be FM before the respawn (this is pre pet XP changes,
could probably do it now).  So, I'd wager a 50 warrior/shammy pair
can handle all 6 and the roamer.  The warriors max out at about level
41 or 42, only hit for 110ish and only have around 2-2.4k hp.\
