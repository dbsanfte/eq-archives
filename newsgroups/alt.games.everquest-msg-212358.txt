The christian god is omnipotent and omniscient (correct me if I'm
wrong).  That being the case, god knew man would disobey him and
eat the apple and acquire the knowledge of good and evil.  This
leads one to wonder if Adam & Eve (and by extension, all of us)
have any free will at all.

After all, if the christian god knows every choice we'll make from
birth until death, doesn't that mean our lives are 'set in stone'?
Where's the free will?
