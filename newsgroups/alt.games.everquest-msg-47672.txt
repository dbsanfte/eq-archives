Where is the best place to sell things I forage? I auction stacks of veggies
etc. to no avail in G Fay. I think it is because there are very few higher
lvl. players who might want such items. Any suggestions?

Also how much are veggies etc. worth? If I ever got a bite I wouldn't know
what a fair price would be.

Thanks in advance.
