Technology IRL is analogous to Magic in EQ.

No I'm saying you can't use reality as excuse to make a game boring
or tedious or NOT FUN.

No I'm saying that my 202 int wizard should be able to pull out a
crayon and scrawl some lines on a gnoll skin. I don't need all the details
just major paths, walls, and  landmarks. Would that really ruin the game?
Am I really asking too much?

How is it I can talk to people across the continents?
How is it that I can use a 'camera' view to look at myself from the outside?
How is it that I can get my EXACT 'map' coordinates but not be able
to draw a map?

That program did a few more things than map.

Why doesn't Verant sue eqmaps and eqatlas then?
