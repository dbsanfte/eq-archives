They can still make the money. With the convenience of a 'city bind' said
casters can reasonably expect cash for binding in a more convenient place
eg in WFP or NFP (the soulbinder appears to be in EFP)  or indeed outside
the city on the plains for those who REALLY need it. If their spells
require them to make cash that way then I think they can reasonably drive
the market price up....cash turnover margins mean something as well as
supply and demand.
