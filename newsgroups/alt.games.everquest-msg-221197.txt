Lower level enchanters do use jasper or peridots for their runes but
normally only cast the runes on themselves. Most at high level only use
arcane rune with an eldritch rune for backup, neither needing a reagent. If
you feel you should be reimbursed for your self buffs then you should make
mention of it when joining a group. If you're having to rune the rest of
your group to live through the adventure then no doubt you should get
reimbursed.

Necros don't start using peridots for pets till level 59, before that it's
all bonechips. Necros can also train in suspended minion and keep the same
pet forever if they're good, unless someone unwisely casts invisible on
them.

Clerics begin using reagents on others at level 14, these days that's pretty
much the first day they play and never stop using them their whole eq life.
Clerics use the reagents on other people, not their pet or just themselves.
If the rest of the group wants the benefit of being buffed with buffs that
use reagents, then the group should be making sure that the group absorbs
the cost. Some adventures have dispellers so even when the buff should last
4 1/2 hours the cleric is recasting during the adventure. If these buffs
were self buff only I'd have to say they should make the decision on whether
or not they want to carry the cost themselves. But the game has been
developed with the assumption that the group is buffed with these spells so
it's expected that they'll be given.

BTW, clerics also use 2 emeralds for divine intervention and pearls for
death pact. Buffs also cast on other people.

Apparently Joolz is not concerned with being unfair about reimbursing others
and wants to get as much pp from the adventures for herself.
