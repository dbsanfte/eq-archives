I love the near total lack of No Drop on the FV server.  Never ran into 
any instances of heavy farming there, less so than on other servers 
honestly.  The Bazaar, as you might imagine, has a good deal more 
variety of stuff available in it, quests are often easier to complete 
because people who -don't- need that rare drop off rare mob item can 
much more easily put it on the market, without having to resort to 
Multiquesting it.

It also makes ML a lot simpler, during a group or raid, you can pretty 
much pick up everything and then worry about splitting it up at the end; 
on the other servers you keep running into drops where you have to stop 
and roll to see who gets to loot the bloody thing.

FV has something called Trivial Loot Code, which makes it so if a mob is 
green to anyone in the group that gets kill credit, it won't drop items 
tagged Magic.  This can be annoying, although if you are deliberately 
farming greens you can get around this by going into raid mode with 
someone... that someone doesn't have to be in your zone, can be off in 
the bazaar, anything.  Being in raid mode kills exp, of course, but if 
you are farming greens then the exp doesn't matter anyway.  It is still 
a bit of a pain to have to set this up if you aren't a two boxer though.
