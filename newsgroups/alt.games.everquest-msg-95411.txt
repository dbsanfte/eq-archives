You don't overnight usually. You do high level grouping
in areas that drop things like the barbed ringmail which you sell
for 7 k plat or so. You do fast quests for things like the ethereal
warhammer you might sell for 1500 - 2 k plat. It all adds up. The
77,000 and especially the 100 k horse are obviously meant for players 
in their 50's who can amass that kind of money.

As long as you keep getting stuff to sell and make it the focus of
your playing, while not spending any of the thousands of plat
on other peoples stuff you see auctioned (that is the hard part) you
will have that much in time.
