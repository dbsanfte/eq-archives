I wouldnt call it nerf, every class is supposedly playable without
requirement of other classes, eg all classes can solo if you play them
right.  Now, arguably rogues, wars etc its gonna be damn hard, you'd
be taking on the light blues and sitting on your but trying to regen
some HP a long time but it is possible. Just you wouldnt want to

As a bard, my pet hate is listening to poeple in group who have VoQ,
spiritual dominion  ** and ** bard mana regen from wind/chorus of
marr, and whine that they need paragon, and mod rods..

thats 18+9+21=48 mana per tick, plus, any FT/Sitting/Standing mana of
their own... 

Especially when the complaints are coming from the tanks..

Everyone says bards have it easy.. well heres something not a lot of
people know..  that wonderful marr song? the one that does 21 mana per
tic.. yes, great, wonderfull.. it does it for every class except the
bard. So, we cant sing mana songs for ourselves. So, yes, while we
maybe able to kite 8 mobs a go.. eventually we are 00m. Unless we
bother get serious FT its a long wait for mana.. as we get med at
...... *TADA* .. 1

yes 1

A whole 1

ice ages come quicker than our mana

All the buffs and stuff you can get are there to make life easier,
they shouldnt be a requirement to function. If you cant function
without it, then you've probably missed something.
