At 58, you can definitely play in Natimbi (Gate of Discord) and
Dranik's Scar (Omens of War) and perhaps Noble's Causeway (OoW) and
Qinimi (GoD).  Most of those expansions are for higher level people,
though, which makes sense since there are lots of pre-existing zones
for people below 65.  The problem being, of course, that most of those
zones have such crap loot, and poor ZEM, so everyone crowds into the
PoP zones, or if you're lucky the "hot zones" (variety is the spice of
life, after all).

Highest on Runnyeye are at least 35, five or six of them on /who
yesterday.  Personally I think levelling is too fast (in EQ2), I keep
outlevelling my quests (and yes, I know I could turn off combat exp).
Not to mention I'll probably never get Bootstrutter's Field Guide to
Antonica to drop now that I'm almost 19. :-(
