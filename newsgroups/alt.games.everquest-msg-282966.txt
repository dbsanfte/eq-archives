Nah, I've never seen any problems caused by just popping the old hard drive 
into a new machine and seeing if it will run. It may not have all the 
drivers you need and such, but I doubt it will do any harm to try it if you 
can't wait for your Windows CD. It may work just enough to get you playing 
in the meantime. If it does, I would recommend burning your EQ directory to 
a DVD before starting over when your OS CD arrives. That way you can just 
copy it back and not have to go through all the patching again, and it will 
retain your UI settings and such.
