Why do you have a separate "side" for installing proggies?  I have a 2GB
partition for Win98SE, a 4GB partition for Win2Kpro, and remaining space on
a 3rd partition.  If I install a proggie using 98 into the 3rd partition
then install it in the same place under 2k pro it works for either OS.  Plus
is saves on the HDD space.


and only play it in win98 now. A lot of times game companies make no
guarantees
