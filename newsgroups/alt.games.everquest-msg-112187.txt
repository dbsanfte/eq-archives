Right, I saw Adam Russell mention in the 'Music breaking up' thread the
possibility that moving around a touch while fighting *may* help increase
the chances of dodging successfully (I stress 'may' because he wasn't saying
that as a fact, just something he'd heard, and I don't want to make him look
silly if it turns out that's not the case).

But that got me thinking.  ARE there any ways to affect your success in
combat in terms of positioning, movement, and so on?  Can anybody say for
sure?  Yes, I KNOW that in order to be successful you have to be within
striking distance, that's a given - but does it improve things if you're,
say, very close, or as far away as possible, or higher up, or lower down
than your target, or anything?  Any thoughts?

I only ask 'cause sometimes I seem to have a run of good hits and other
times I'm just flailing about hopelessly and I don't know whether it's just
down to the luck of my (admittedly rather sad) stats.
