}I'd be very surprised if it was.

I've heard from many sources that it is disabled for use on PCs on PvP 
servers, don't know about arena combat, but can confirm that as of oh, a 
month or so ago, it worked in a duel, although it was buggy.  Our cleric 
fell off that dang bidge in Sebilis by NG...  target, /d, charm, summon 
pet...  all of us saw her reappear standing by me and follow me around, 
but when charm broke she'd pop back to where she was.  And she reported 
that on her screen she didnt move at all.  Goofy as all heck.
