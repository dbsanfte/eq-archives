Now that I think of it...its a good thing I am a necromancer, dealing with
the dead, otherwise eating spongy flesh wouldn't sound very appatizing.  But
I guess it's better than some of the trade skill recipies (bat wing
crunchies, rat ear pie, others).  There was a trade skill site somewhere
that listed the recipies and told of them how they'd appear in a true
recipie book.  Giving baking, preparation, and eating instruction, and told
of them in a way where you wish Norath had fast food restruants (though I
guess an equivilent would be the merchants that always sell infinate
supplies of rations, iron rations, meat pies, fish, milk, water, and other
more desireable foods).

The mushrooms are yellow with white spots.  They are a meal they say.  They
drop from the mushroom things in the same zone.  Those square (around, not
top) lighthouse/tower shaped indifferent con mushrooms that hit you with
their top, bowing down to you as they fight.

I asked the zone and the only responce I got was that "eating the mushrooms
is really groovy if you eat them and then look at lights" and other comments
to that refference. =)
