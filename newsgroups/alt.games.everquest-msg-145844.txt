Ranger:

I pull with Ensnare sometimes as I can do a reasonable amount of
damage to the mob by the time it gets anywhere near me, it also saves
me having to channel it later on and probably putting a little dink in
my DPS at the same time.  An ensnared mob is also easier to root park
should anything untoward happen in the meantime, when I see the
message that my root has broken I know I still have more time in hand
before it's upon us.  Also invaluable if you're thinking about Fear
kiting should things go FUBAR.

Wouldn't recommend this in somewhere like Dreadlands though, some Monk
twink would be trying to tear the damn mob off you as you nursed it
back to the group.

Necro (especially) or Druid:

I pull with Ensnare/Darkness to KEEP THAT DAMN THING AWAY FROM ME
while I get Fear/Root/Pet prepared.
