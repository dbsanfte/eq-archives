There's a building just down the street (Just south of the newly swank
"Pearl" district in Portland) that has bas relief panels running around
the building that are very risque - the building looks to date from
the 1930-40's.  I'm sure that must have outraged some people.  Personally
I like it when folks who are a little too straight-laced get bonked.

Actually, if anyone is to blame for any flames coming out of that thread,
it will probably be me - for a variety of reasons it reminded me of some
research I'd done recently on Kinsey, and those topics are (IMO) 
inherently more flammable, and I should have considered twice before
posting them.
