Thanks.  I went there yesterday but didn't find an answer.  Today I found a
link the official EQ message boards and am hoping the fact that I was
running DirectX 8.1 was the problem (could have sworn that I upgraded to 9
awhile ago).  Based on how slow the download from Microsoft is going
(estimated 2+ hours!), I think a lot of EQ players may be doing the same.  I
hope this works - this is the one piece of candy I was really looking
forward to.
