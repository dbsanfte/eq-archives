    Lake Rathetear isn't a good place to test, as mobs will despawn when
swimming in the water at times (buggy as all hell). Go to West Karana, near
NK zone, south side. Get a skeleton from the undead ruins. Use SoW and run
to the far side of West Karana, along the water. IIRC there's nothing along
the shore that'll interfere with the test.
