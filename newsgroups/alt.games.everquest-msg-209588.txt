I'm pretty broke atm and my Ranger is just an Alt but there is NO WAY I
would sell my Tolans Bracer,
it's far too useful. Of course, if you're not 45 then it's a bit pointless.

TBH, you won't find many toys usable until 45.
I would suggest a bit of self restraint, buy the items you need now. Decent
but cheap items,  haste (Sash of Dragon Born are under 4k on BB)  Weapons
(Venomous Axe is nice if you are over 35) and a nice Bow, Blessed Faydark
Thunderbolt are pretty nice, assuming you worship Tunare and can get one for
a decent price.
Then when hit 45 all the items you couldn't use will be cheaper than they
are now.
I would post my Magelo for my Ranger (no the one on FV) but magelo's site
seems to be down atm.
I would suggest swarmcaller...Average 2hder by todays standards but procs a
slow, good for solo'ing (procs at 45)
I use 2 black acrylia weapons, under 2k each, look great and proc 45pnt
Lifetap. http://www.rubberintheear.com/q3/pics/Ninasie.jpg <- No Vials of
Prismatic Dye were used on the Ranger :ï¿½)
Tolans Bracer is really a must for anyone who's going to be bow
kiting....You never have enough arrows and "EQ" can be long way away from
45th.
Upgrade your haste item, Soulscream belt 31% and I've seen them 20 - 25k
pretty often. RBG 27% are commonly 20k and less now.
Tolans Helm will give you Superior Camo for indoor invis but you'll get the
spell yourself at 49 so not sure that's totally worth it.
