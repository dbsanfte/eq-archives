I don't think it is having to track that he's trying to avoid, but rather
having to wait for the mob to spawn so he can track it.  Just as he doesn't
want to sit at a camp waiting for a 30 hour spawn, he doesn't want to run
around a zone for 30 hours hitting track trying to catch a rare random
spawn.  My guess is that he would be OK with a quest that involved going and
tracking something that is almost always up (e.g., something like the quest
for the OS key...the Hunter and Forager are almost all up, except those rare
times when one of the rare mobs on their spawn tables spawns instead).
