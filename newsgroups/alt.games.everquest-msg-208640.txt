 When is the last time you did it? FoH tried it three times and it
crashed the zone. We tried it a few days after them and it crashed on us
as well with her near 60%. Unless it's something we are doing I don't
think she's able to be killed with the event as it currently is. 

 Thanks SOE for halting backflagging. I guess that's one way to stop
progression since you can't do shit without Saryrn.
