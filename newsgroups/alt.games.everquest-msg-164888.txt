People don't speak much about what they find pleasing. However, when
something they detest comes to surface, they'll yell as loud as they can.

Refer to babies for that point.

There is no doubt in my mind that -any- criticism here, or anywhere on the
internet, is not meant to belittle anyone. That's largely due to the overall
attitude on the internet.

"Since Person_A can't beat me to death with a sock full of pennies, I'll act
like a prick so I can pretend to be a tough guy!"

Admittedly, that is the 'Walter Smitty' syndrome you mentioned.

Which leads to my next point... if everyone playing EQ was in the same room,
I very seriously doubt anyone would train, kill steal, ninja loot, or
whatever. In that same respect, if everyone from this newsgroup posted from
the same room, I imagine that more people would choose their words more
carefully.

>  I don't take the NG seriously.

You don't take this newsgroup seriously, yet you like to think of yourself
as a martyr that dedicates his time to bettering the community?

I find myself thinking that this is a vendetta.
