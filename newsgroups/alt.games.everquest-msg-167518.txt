It depends a litle on your class. A low 50's cleric could easily get a group
in velks, but a low 50's melee may have a hard time getting a group. Any low
50's could probably get a group in KC. KC really sucks, but if you are
looking for pickup groups it one of the few places youll find one. You could
also try maidens eye.
