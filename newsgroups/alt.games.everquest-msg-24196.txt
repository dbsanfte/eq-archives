    Count this as a vote against them.

    Trains, and a lack of people to group with. Getting over there with a
level-appropriate group is difficult enough that you'll only really see
young Erudites there.

    You know, it just may have. One of the things VI seems to want is for
people to not "linger" in places they've levelled past, to avoid crowding.
Nobody lingers in The Warrens.

    That's why I made an Erudtie Necro - just to see that side of the world.
I'm even going to try hunting Stonebrunt and Kerra Ridge.

    Warrens code will NOT stop that. Coin loot still drops just the same.
Only Magic and/or Lore and/or No Drop items are affected.

    (a) They cannot price gouge. If people don't think an item is worth X,
they will not pay X.
    (b) Are you really in favour of a policy that requires YOU to run around
camping gear instead of levelling up yourself? Because if farmers aren't
getting them, YOU have to. Personally, I despise camping a "required" item,
like a quest drop. Sitting in one spot, waiting for my ticket out of
whatever hell hole I'm in - YAWN. That would be Luclin if any "required" or
optimal gear were to drop there off a low-level mob.
