I agree that it's hard to have any sympathy for a Tunare worshipping
druid that gets fucked helping on a PoG raid. That said, however, if
this thing about taking faction hits and not getting a message is true,
I think it should be reported as a /bug and see if Verant will put up an
answer. They train you to look for the scrolling faction hit messages,
negative and positive, for fifty some fucking levels. Then you go into
PoG and suddenly you're getting stealth hits?
  Again, never fought in PoG as a Tunare worshipper, so no direct
knowledge, but if this is true, it's either a bug in the system or one
mean ass trick by the developers on the upper level players.
