Damage bonus is actually related to the weilder's level.  That 9/19 weapon 
will have a much different damage bonus on a level 1 character.  The 
damage bonus you see is the main hand damage bonus, which is the amount 
added to any successful hit.  The minimum damage you will do with a weapon 
in your primary hand is (damage bonus)+1.
