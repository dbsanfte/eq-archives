Not if you compare to original release of EQ. I do remember times when 
there were 2 dungeons in EQ available to higher level people (40+). And 
in those 2 dungeons you had approximately 2-4 hour long waiting lists to 
be allowed to kill something :) Hence guard camping etc.
I'm sure given time DAOC will grow at least half as big as EQ is now, 
but for now it's sufficient

Yes, some classes can be better than others, but no classes are useless

Actually it will take a bit of time to get organized. On my original 
server there are guild alliances that *work*. People coordinating RvR 
raids and such. BTW, coordinating a fairly large RvR raid is a bit more 
complex than coordinating a dragon raid or what have you in EQ. First of 
all there are no "set strategies". You don't get the standard "clerics 
sit here, fighters go there". Mainly because greater numbers are 
required and because your enemy is much less predictable than a dragon 
that has been killed weekly for the last 4 years
