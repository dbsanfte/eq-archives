My theory on the End Times Prophet is
that he is trying to annoy the usenet
users of one of the
groups that he has crossposted to
into moving from Usenet to a certain private
for profit special interest web site.
The rest of the groups are just cover.
Money explains many things which seem unexplainable. or maybe I am just
cynical.
And clearly that group would be alt.pagan.  Too bad those of us here don't
mind him so much, else he'd be gone already.

Well, Hell, if "alt.pagan" were going to move, they wouls be better
considering my group, which is free of charge:

 ( emoticon of amusement )

That is interesting. What is a pagan? Here in
the USA they are a motorcycle gang.
