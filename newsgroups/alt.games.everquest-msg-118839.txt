Alternately, Fear is a line of spells cast on a target to make it run away.
While
shaman cannot cast this line, clerics, enchanters, necromancers, shadowknights
and bards can, and druids (maybe rangers too?) get an animal only version, while
several melee classes get a skill called "instill doubt" that has a similar
effect (unfortunately
its terribly unreliable)

Because of this effect, something called Fear Kiting or Reverse Kiting is
possible,
where you Snare (slow movement) the target, then Fear it so it slowly walks
away.  You can beat on its back (including backstabs), Nuke it, DOT it for
full effect since it -isn't- moving towards a target... what you have to worry
about
is that it is moving out of your control and may find friends.  It is refered to
as
"Reverse" Kiting, by the way, because instead of you running around with the
mob chasing you, you chase the fleeing mob.

Hmm, another Kite technique is Hate Kiting, where you deliberately make
a mob so mad at you that it follows you around while your friends and/or
pets beat on its back, like a fear kite that you can control... .unfortunately
this "reverse reverse kite" doesn't qualify for full DOT damage, as the mob
is now moving towards you.

I"ve also hear the term "Charm Kiting."  Charm spells make a mob into your
pet.  If you charm one mob and then use it to help kill a second, then you
have a half dead mob on your hands.  Drop charm on it and charm a fresh
mob, which will now easily kill your first mob while half dying.  Now get
a fourth mob in to finish that third one, and so forth.  I'd think Chain Charming

would be a better term, because movement isn't really a part of the
equation... but people are so used to calling exotic killing techniques
"Kite" that I think they stick it places it doesn't belong, like the suffix Gate
in political scandals.
