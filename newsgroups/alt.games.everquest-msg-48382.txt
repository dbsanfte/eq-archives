You're both forgetting you have to be 46 before you can go to Hate.

As for upgrades: you should definitely do the baking step of the
Thurgadin shawl quests, for a 3 wis 3 svm 3 svc range slot item. And
when you've saved up some more money, you might want to try to replace
that belt with belt of the Cenobite, giving you a larger WIS margin
for when you want to start collecting resist gear.
