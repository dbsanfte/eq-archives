No, plat is NOT worthless to me. It's worth to me = what it can buy. I am 
not going to be concerned if my braided ivy cords go down a hundred or two 
in value- the bonus remains the same and the effectiveness remains the 
same. 

I am not in an uber guild- at the moment, in fact, I am guildless. I am not 
in the super rare nodrop game.
