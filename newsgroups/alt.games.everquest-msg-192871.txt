      If you just want to get your level to 65, soloing -- efficiently,
as any class that can do it -- is the fastest way.  However, a solo
character cannot fight anywhere he wants to, and cannot defeat the
high-end or some mid-range named monsters.  Tank characters are vital
in raids, which are what complete quests and find powerful items.
