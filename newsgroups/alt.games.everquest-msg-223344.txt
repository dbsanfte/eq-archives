Let me guess; they only test you for 20/20 vision?

20/20 is a standard for perfect vision - if you're 70 years old.
People in their 20s are supposed to easily have 20/15 or better.
Personally, I feel uncomfortable and see blurry at a distance if my
glasses only correct me to 20/17, something an American optometrist
who thought 20/20 was acceptable for everyone would never be able to
correct.
Anyway, the 'infinity' measure is done at 20 feet, which means you
might still have -0.25 to go to correct for actual infinity, and if
you're not properly corrected (for instance, with letters smaller than
20/20), things farther away than 20 feet will be foggy.

Aw, that's not so bad. If your error is purely refractional they
shouldn't have any problems correcting that. I had that when I was 14.

Part of the reason I am now studying this is that I was always curious
about what they did. I had my optometrist explain the astigmatism
stuff to me when I was a teenager, and he was also pretty good at
telling me when I was supposed to see a bit fuzzy for a test. (There's
a difference between explaining a test, and letting you know what
you're 'supposed to see', which would lead some people to try to
achieve that and give false results)

Want to know what's ironic?
Here I am, bitching about how American optometrists and their precious
20/20 sucks ass... and when I am done with my education, which will
allow me to work everywhere in Europe except Iceland and Albania, I
won't be able to do this in the US. Because there, for some reason,
you have to damn near have a PhD to prescribe glasses. 
I don't care if they're more qualified than me to diagnose illnesses
(I'll learn when to send people to doctors instead) when they're so
unimpressive and mediocre with respect to how they do the glasses.
