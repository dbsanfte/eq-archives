After taking about six months off EQ, and now getting back into it, I
remembered that my primary character is a member of a guild on Veeshan
(Winters of Discontent guild). Now, over the past couple of weeks whenever I
do a "/who all Winters" I see no one but me. Is there any way to determine
if or when any other guild members may have logged on, who the guild leader
is, what the status ofhte guild is, etc? I'd hate to think that I'm the only
remaining member. Is there any way to determine this?
