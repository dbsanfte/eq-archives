Err - I couldn't give a toss if they wanted me to change my name, I don't
take the game that seriously. A matter of fact I don't even take my RL that
seriously. My entire point is that all these people running around with the
page button hot-keyed and looking eagle eyed for the slightest misdemeanour
infraction do more harm to the atmosphere of the game than a legion of
differently spelled Legolyss's.

I don't even care about Plz and TY anymore. It is just the normal way a  lot
of younger people communicate over PC's these days. We sound like a bunch of
retiree's wheeling around shaking our walking sticks : "when I was a boy
people had manners........"
