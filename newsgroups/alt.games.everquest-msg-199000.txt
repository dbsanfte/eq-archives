Hello people  I know that a Druid is supposed to a caster, but there
occasions that you might have to melee  (Lot of casting and/or poor
mana managment).  What kind of primary weapon should someone have?  I
have Black Enameled Mace But DMG 7 Magic Item  and still take a
beating to the point which I have to zone or port.  By the way, im
hunting blues and Unrest .  Yeah sometimes I get more than 1.  Any
suggestions?
