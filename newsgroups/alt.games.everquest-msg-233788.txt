Well, I went to Sanctus Seru and did a bit of hunting.  Reasonable pace 
and approx 16pp a kill.

Now, in TM whilst waiting for the runner to appear (anyone know what the 
timer and/or PH is?)  I got acrylia blocks and windstones which are on 
my trader, plus shedloads of runes and other misc bits and bobs which 
went to the vendor (except the rune of Xegonay which seems to be worth a 
bit more in baz[1]) and I made more money in the same time period than I 
did in SS.

It was more fun too!  OK, so no XP, but using buffing Booboo and letting 
him rip was amusing.  The odd bit of AA xp too from some light blues.

[1] So many different runes, heavenly only knows if I sold something of 
value to a vendor.  I did get a couple of 'mark' types, which are on my 
vendor too, but only at a guess price.
