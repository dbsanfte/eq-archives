Its a waste even if it does. What you then have is an everquest server
with zero content. You have no monsters, no AI, no npcs, no quests,
etc. All of those things are server software side, not client software
side. If they were clientside also verant would be pretty dumb and
we'd probably have EQ taking up 15 gigs of hardrive space.

I think at its zenith you could be on the emulator with a character
you made in whatever zone and dress it up in the various armors to see
what it looked like, that was pretty much its best use. You could also
pull up some npc model like a god and have it just standing there.
