I have seen several suggested mechanics to produce the streakiness of
their RNG, no way to tell what exactly they do from only the symptoms.
But, I don't think "they're lying to cover up their weak-ass RNG".
There're several good low overhead pseudo-random number generation
algorithms out there, and it's likely that they are using one of them
and wrapping it in some other mechanism to deliberately produce the
streakiness.  Any generator worth a damn would produce occasional
streaks, to mimic "real" randomness.  I'm pretty sure they've built a
streaky RNG deliberately so that it would be more likely to affect
the outcome of a battle.  Think about how many randoms there are in
even as minor a battle as a L25 one-on-one melee.  Without deliberate
streakiness you could reliably predict the outcome of most any battle
to a ridiculous level of precision.  Combat would be less interesting
(i.e. a lot more boring).  While that might be an xp grinder's or
lewt pharmer's wet dream, don't forget that EQ started out trying to
be a role-playing game, there were a lot of things attempted to stymie
the number crunchers (with little success in that regard).

just my $.02,
