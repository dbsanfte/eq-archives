Go to Lake of Ill Omen in Kunark.  Great place to get XP and meet
people; very easy to find groups and the MOB's are not very dangerous.
 I did 20 - 45 relatively quickly using only a few adjacent Kunark
zones (Ill Omen, Frontier Mountains, Dreadlands, ...)  I would
recommend you avoid low level guilds; they tend to be more trouble
than they are worth.  Consider joining a guild at 50+, however.
