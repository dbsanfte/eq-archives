LOL...Yes, it would be nice  if everyone learned how to fix their own
computers(except for those people that make a living fixing peoples
computers might not be happy about it)  ...This is exactly the point
too,especially in a NG like this..People that can diagnose their computer
well enough and write it up in a message here can probably figure out the
problem and fix it themselves..Where as people that don't know as much about
computers probably can't accurately describe their problem well enough for
someone not sitting in front of it to figure out the problem, so it's easier
to say, just format and start over..
