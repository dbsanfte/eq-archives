char certainly isn't a word (unless you are referring to burning 
something) nor is it a recognized abbreviation. That makes its use as 
slang. Or least as slang as toon is.

But if one doesn't "play his character" in the rp sense, and its just an 
the in game sprite/model/toon that one has selected to represent 
"oneself" then it isn't a "character" in any meaninful sense at all.

That is how EQ is played by many... possibly the majority.

I'm not offended in the least by pls (or even plz) and thx (or ty) or 
(pst - please send tell).

Come on, they're saying please and thank you for crying out loud. These 
are strictly unneccessary niceties in communication as it is, its a 
releif they're there at all in the hyper abbreviated eq-chat.
