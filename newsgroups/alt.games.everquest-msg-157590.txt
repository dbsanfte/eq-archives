<sigh>  I guess it sounds that way, doesn't it?  Honestly, that's now how I
intended it.

Every once in a while I get into a situation where something seems so
*obvious* to me, that when other people don't see it that way I get
frustrated.  To me, it's *obvious* that we would ease up on raiding to let
us play with the new PoP expansion and to level up - the potential benefits
are tremendous if we get *everyone* up to 65.  All we lose is a couple of
drops AoW and Ssra drops.  Of course, other people have different
perspectives - loot is important, and we can't afford a distraction if we
are to maintain our focus as a guild.  To get to the next level, we need our
folks with the best equipment possible, which means taking advantage of
loot-giving mobs whenever they're up, no matter the circumstances.

I can see that perspective now, thanks in part to you and the other people
who responded and thanks in part to what some sympathetic people in my guild
told me in private tells.  At the time, I was fixated on what I considered
to blindingly obvious - this is *special*, we *need* to get ourselves up to
65, let's take a break and get there!  I was so convinced of my position -
when other people didn't see agree, I was certain all I needed to do was
explain it to them and they'd see things my way.  =)  It's one of my
personal failings.

The things that stand in my favor are that even when I disagreed, I was
never violent about it.  I just calmly stated my position (albeit over and
over again for about fifteen minutes) and, when all was said and done, I was
there in Kael ready to help take down AoW and said nothing more about it.
So I hope the message got through that I will always do what the guild asks
of me, even if I don't necessarily agree with it.

We'll see.  =)  As I said, I'm interested in seeing how the guild will
react - a /guildremove wouldn't surprise me, although it would disappoint
me.
