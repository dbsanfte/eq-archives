Update your magelo :)

From your magelo it would be easily your best item even without the
effect.

I think you are over-estimating the time required, and
under-estimating the worth of the item. Once you have it you will
wonder how you ever did without. You never have to mem res. You have a
100 hp mana item. You can res a fallen raid so fast that they will all
be back in before you have mana to cast even one res. You can res
without having to sit down to mem the spell. You stop bothering to
coordinate who is doing the ressing with other clerics, because no one
loses mana if the fallen person gets clicked three times.

Really, it's a bit like leveling a cleric from 62 (Virtue) to 65
(umm...). It's a grind, it has no special magic intrinsic worth; but
people look at you a bit funny if you haven't done it, and once you've
done it you are glad you did, if only because once it's done it's
done.

The advice about trying to find someone level-appropriate to the camps
for you to PL is good.

Oh and a word of warning now, the final Ragefire fight is seriously
anticlimactic for a group of 65s.
