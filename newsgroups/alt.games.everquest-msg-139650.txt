Don't be silly. I'm not attacking you. I found your post humorous also.
But the underlying premise is just wrong. Granted, I'll give you the
point that not all MB capable sorcerers are in high end guilds. But a
LOT of them are. And no matter what their guild, they still only make up
a tiny percentage of the population. So again, that doesn't alter my
opinion of James' premise that it's "not that hard to get that gear". 
There's a few people in niche situations like the one you pointed out
that certainly could, or at least get close (dependin on what comes up
for sale when) but damned few none the less.
