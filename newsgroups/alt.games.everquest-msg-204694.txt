Many thanks for the answer, was what I had thought.

As a continuance to this thread, would anybody be able to give me
recommendations on what weapons I should be using where?

I have just hit 50, and am unsure of how to progress my character from here.

Here is my magelo for reference:

http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=632063

Eventually I want to get AM3/EQ, until then I will try and get hold of a
tolans, or just make arrows, but until 59 my primary damage will be melee.

So do I put slow/big hitter on offhand, with fast weapon in main (when
tanking), and slow/big hitter in main and fast in off (when assisting).

I am also currentley working on 2HS with a weighty polearm (damn those
things are cheap :) ), which I am read, but dont know for sure, can
outdamage a good dual wield setup (including swiftwind), for less aggro and
less damage taken (ripostes etc).

I dont have a great deal of pp to spend, and am not in an uber guild, so no
suggestions of getting uber blade of deathevilness_02 from bazaar, or
killing a god for a weapon, just basic recommendations on the most
effiecient weapon combos, in terms of speed/dps and aggro, until 59 / 60.

Thanks again for any help.
