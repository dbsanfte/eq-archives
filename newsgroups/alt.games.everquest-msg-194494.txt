Well, I got the new computer yesterday afternoon and got it all set
up, copied everything over from my old system and installed everything
under the sun here.... still got 98 GIG free space! I LOVE it! :)

I'll post this message in the main for you too just incase you don;t
catch it here.

When I start EQ the difference is remarkable. The startup sequence
takes like 1/4 or less of the time my old P3-500 took.

Ingame, I have everything turned on and am playing at 1024x768. The
only place I noticed any lag at all was the Bazaar. Even there the
system only got a little jerky in the center of the bazaar. Most of
the time it was pretty smooth and only got bogged down a couple of
times. Compared to the P3-500 I was using the difference was between
Playasble in Bazaar (New Computer) and totally unplayable in Bazaar
(old computer).

Everyplace else was excellent except one minor point in HK. I noticed
my character seemed to be taking a step and then slipping forward.
That's what it looked like. Kind of like normal step then a skip step
or a rapid step. Nothing bad, just kinda noticable.

All in all, in my firse few minutes of playing with the thing I
couldn;t be happier with it! Time will tell the whole story though
won;t it? :)
