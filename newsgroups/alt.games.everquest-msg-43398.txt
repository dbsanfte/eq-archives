Scrap that, read it properly this time : )   It was trying to tell me that
in SK most of the blue mobs are a pain in the ass to kill, or too slow to
kill, making fer slow levelling, etc.  Sorry  : (

I hunted there solo at 35 for a while though...and didn't really seem to
have any probs that I noticed, only thing that annoyed me was everything was
so spread out or camped up, I would say..why bother... solo at the overthere
is easier, quicker, and better exp, in my opinion.
