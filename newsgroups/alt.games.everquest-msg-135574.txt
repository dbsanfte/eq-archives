From time to time, I will see someone claim they are a battle cleric. 
I just assumed they were being silly, trying to get a chuckle or two.

Lately, I have begun to suspect that this is a real pursuit of some
people.  Being a cleric myself, I can't say I have experience grouping
with these folks.  Could someone please explain to me how a battle
cleric works?  Is this a joke or the real thing?  How do they
contribute to a group - Melee?  Nukes?  Do they only work in a group
with a particular composition of classes?  And finally, how effective
are they?

I can't see how a cleric can put out appreciable damage that would
otherwise be better spent medding up mana.  The only reasonable melee
output I could see doing was mentioned on a post a while back by Lance
Berg saying you could 'med bounce' the melee attacks.  But even then,
I have a hard time concentrating on the fight AND looking for the
increments on the mana bar to calculate the timing of the tick... 
That bar just moves too slowly at my current level.

I would suspect fighting undead is viable, given claims of some
clerics doing solo careers.  However, I just don't see how this can
be.  I have tried taking on undead solo in my late 40's, and it really
was not worth it.  If had all buffs up, and I'd end up with low health
and 20% mana after each kill.
