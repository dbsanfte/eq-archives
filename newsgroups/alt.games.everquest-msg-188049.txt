The second shammy. :-)

Planes groups these days are slower+healer+tank+DPS.

Since I play a cleric, I usually wind up in the healer slot, obviously.
I can do a good job of keeping up mana (even without KEI) if the group
single pulls. If they pull multiples, I'll almost certainly need a med
break.

A shaman in the healer slot *is* a less efficient healer, and they have
fewer heals to play with. However, the 58+ shaman can canni down to 30%
HP then use their 2K heal to do it all over again. As such it only takes
a couple of minutes to get back to full mana - when the cleric might
take ten minutes to do so.

Note that I am *specifically* talking about shamans at level 58+. Below
that level, I agree there's no contest. Cleric all the way. :-)

Shamans *can* heal, however; all I'm saying is that 2 shamans, if one
is of level 58 or higher, can do as well or better than shaman+cleric
in healing power.

I very much agree, but I was talking about a shaman as a *replacement*
healer, not the debuffing shaman *also* healing. I agree the latter would
be impractical.

I'm also not denying that a cleric's heals are more flexible. If the tank
does a good job of holding aggro, however, the cleric will only be
casting CHeal, and for that the shaman's ludicrously better mana regen
tips the balance.

...Until you add rez into the picture, which is why I was saying that
rez is one of the key contributions of a cleric to the group.

I should mention that I've never really played a shaman, only grouped
with them, including situations where they (as slower) took over healing
while I medded back up - and kept their mana higher than mine in the
process.

In a raid situation, you need the better punch and flexibility of cleric
heals. In an exp group, that need is much reduced.

        ...Ronny
