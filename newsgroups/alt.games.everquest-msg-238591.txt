I ignored my 60th level spells initially.

Level 60 is a short one, get to 61, get some Ethereal parchments from PoP
zones and get your 61/62 spells.  While you're doing that, you can start
farming as other posters have suggested, and get the cash to buy the 60th
spells you really need.  I've still ignored some of my 60th spells, but
since they were eclipsed by my 61-65th it's no issue.

You could always hunt for the 60th spells - while some are dropped only by
major raid targets, many are dropped by mobs you can easily single group,
or in some cases, kill with fewer than a single group - mobs in Skyfire,
OS, etc.
