Grats!! I know what you mean.  I run a few different toons but I recently
decided to do something I've never done before... the newbie armor quests,
for my bard specifically.

I didn't think I'd enjoy it half as much as I did.  I stayed awake til 5am
getting all the peices except my bp and greaves.  Next day I jacked in with
5 hours sleep and started over again.  I'm still working on the greaves (the
orc fibula is my bane!!) and can't wait to complete the set.

It looks damn sexy too so I'll be pulling it out for special occasions long
afer the peices have been replaced with better.
