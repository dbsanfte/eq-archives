We already have laws in place that should have prevented Enron. The
real problem is the total lack of oversight by the SECC, and weak
sentencing when corporate executives are finally caught.

The thefts happened under Clintons watch, and Clinton also recieved
significant support and campaign funding from China. Can you say the
same about Bush1 or Reagan?

Clinton was offered OBL on a plate, and took a pass. His total
disregard for the growing terrorist threat and his gutting of our
intelligence agencies is the main reason why 9/11 happened in the
first place.

>>As someone else pointed out.. Klinton spent a lot of time, money and

No, he was diverting attention away from his latest political scandal.
Wasting American lives (Somalia), and wasting tax-payer money
(Tomahawks missles launched at tents in the desert the day Monica
testified).

If Clinton could have done nothing to prevent the .com crash, then why
are you so quick to blame Bush for the aftermath? You can't have it
both ways. Just last night I saw a report showing that the markets are
back to where they were in '97 prior to the bubble. Looks bad on
paper, but the reality is that we are experiencing a market correction
that is part of a normal economic cycle. You can't have huge gains
(.com bubble) without huge losses.

Funny how our country has done fine since 1929 without those laws.
Perhaps the real problem is the fact that the people who should have
been checking up on Enron's (and others) filings weren't doing their
jobs. 

>>Exactly WHAT was good about Klinton? Please tell us what he did that

>Budget surpluses.

All lies and fake money. Surplusses over-inflated based on the .com
bubble. 

>World Political stability.

Clinton sweeped the growing problems under the rug, and now the
current administration has to deal with them. Don't mistake sucking up
to the socialists in old-Europe, with good foreign policy or
"political stability".

While Billy boy turned a blind eye to foreign affairs, France and
Russia were arming Saddam, and OBL/Al'Qeda was planning and training
for 9/11.

>International Free Trade.

Which can be partly blamed for the downturn in the US economy.

Impeached in the congress, but not convicted by the Senate is still
impeached.

He was also disbarred for perjuring himself durring the Paula Jones
scandal.
