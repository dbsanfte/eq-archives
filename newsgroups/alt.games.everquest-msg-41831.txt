    In my high school, we had a holocaust class, adn I won a scholarship to
D.C with this essay.  After beeing  unsettled by some of the comments Ive
read, I'm gonna post it. I'll probably never post again, so feel free to
flame away :)
/start ancient document

The reason why we should Study the Holocaust can be summed up in one
quotable statement. By understanding the whys of the past, we can answer the
why nots of the present.

 Apart from this, there is no other reason to take this particular instance
of brutality out of Mankind's past, and study it any more thoroughly than
the rest of history. It is in the hope of  a better future for all of
mankind that we re-open the greivous scars of Nazi history, in a study that
will hopefully quell any doubt that future answers to problems will not
include genocide, no matter what the cause, no matter what the problem.

 Never Again!
