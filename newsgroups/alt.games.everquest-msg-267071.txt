It doesn't force other species, it forces itself to have evolved in 
rapid bursts. 

If it was gradually evolving we wouldn't have umpteen hundreds of 
fossils spanning millions years showing it exactly the same, and no 
fossils of it being slightly different.

See the graph below: If each . represents a fossil, and the horizontal 
is time, and the vertical is 'change' then:
.. ..
       .. .    ..    .. . .
                              . . .     .. ..  ..

We don't have any fossiles showing the transition, but even without 
them, the graph lines are perfectly flat. If evolution was gradual, the 
fossils at the beginning of the 2nd line should be closer to the 1st 
line, and at the end they should be closer to the 3rd line. But they 
aren't, the species is in equilibrium the whole time, and then there is 
a new species that we think is descended from the old, and its in 
equilibrium too throughout all the fossils we have of it.

It seems clear from the fossil record that the transitions occured 
rapidly in this species evolution.
