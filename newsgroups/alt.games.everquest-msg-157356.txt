This is a sweet expansion, basically it is a firepot room, with
vendors and the library. I am able to move around norrath without
paying some druid/wiz to port me. I thought having the spires port to
nexus was nice, this is great!

I got an OT ped, a Fay ped, GD ped, and more! Most every zone is set
three zones from every other location.

Do not make the mistake of assuming this is high end content only. 

I think they had a nice idea for the PoK. Now I have to explore
around.
