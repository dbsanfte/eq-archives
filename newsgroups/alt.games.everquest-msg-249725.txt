Interesting.  I went there solo with my 34 monk, and everything
I found was dark blue.  I killed a few rats and bats but chose
not to mess with the granite guys.  (I liked the fact there's a
room where the Taelosians are creating them.)  Some of the bats
had as much as a plat or two, which isn't bad for the level but
not great; I don't know if the loot scales.

None of the rats/bats seemed to be social at that level.
