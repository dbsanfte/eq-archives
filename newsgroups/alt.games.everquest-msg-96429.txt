Hows this for bad form second reply to my self.
The guy who started the whole question (Quasinom de Plume) on the
safehouse boards has now removed the post that he made there (or at
least the ref to no more hell levels)
http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessageRange?topicID=10258.topic

and also removed the prost that he made to two other boards :

http://pub39.ezboard.com/ftinkeringforumfrm1.showMessage?topicID=244.topic
http://pub18.ezboard.com/fmithanielmarrdailynewsfrm41.showMessage?topicID=520.topic

He has however posted this :

<<No I don't have any other info that I will comment on or any idea how
they plan on implementing the changes if they happen. Not all things get
past the Test server. Consider it a rumor and flame  me all you want if
it doesn't happen - I won't be making posts like this ever again
anyways.
Scott said this on the Necro boards:
Quote: <SNIP Quote of scott as above>

You could interpret this many ways but I from what I've heard previous
to this post being made, I personally believe they've figured out a way
to change it. >>

Obviously his orriginal posts were made before Scott's reply. Also note
that he mentions "what he heard previously". However his removal of
previous posts leads me to think that either he let slip something that
he should not have, or he is talking out of his arse.

Still comes down to no one knows.

So far I have not seen anyone from the Test server confirm that there
have been any changes to xp gain during hell levels or any other level.

HTH,

Jim
