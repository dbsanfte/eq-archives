Im nearly at level 34 and was looking forward to quad kiting and was 
thinking about a tactic i might use for dealing with adds.
If i see a potential add that could become a problem heading my way i 
was thinking of casting harmony on it to reduce its aggro radius
Does anyone else use this tactic or they just root adds if and when they 
become a problem?
