For kicks (and possible future guild utility), I created a Brell-worshiping
halfling rogue and got him over to Paineel. He's explored The Hole, dragged
a corpse for a grateful 34 wizard that fell down the trap in Paineel, and
found out he's KoS to the ratmen warriors.

Question 1: Is he KoS to anything other than ratmen?

Question 2: Is there anywhere ratmen are guaranteed not to be lurking? I
know they're in the jail area, and seem to be a rare spawn in other places.
If there were some places where they are not, it could speed up CRs a bit as
he wouldn't have to sneak-hide.
