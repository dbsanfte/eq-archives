I just can't seem to know how people can concentrate on more than one
character at a time.  My main is a bard and maybe that is why I can't
conceive this, but it just seems like if I tried to do so, I would go
completely insane.

The other reason would be because I'm so cheap I am barely willing to pay
$13/month for a game.
