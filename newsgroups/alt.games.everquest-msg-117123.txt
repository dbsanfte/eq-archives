  Also, when it comes to PLing, any class that has some sort of memory blur
type of skill (Memory Blur, Atone, Feign Death) can make good PLers.  You
just whack a mob down to a sliver of health, memory blur it, move off a bit,
and let your little friend get the last few blows.

  The person being PL'd won't get very many skill increases at all, but the
kills should be almost as quick as YOUR mana/skills allow, almost totally
independantly of the skills of the person being PL'd.
