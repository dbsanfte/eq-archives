Stupid druids...everyone knows the world revolves around gnome enchanters.

Here's a hint for you, though you've probably figured it out by now:
Strangers ("strangers" = someone not in your guild, group, or group of
friends) who EXPECT you to expend your mana on them aren't worth anything
more than being put on /ignore.  No, really.  Don't let the "druids are
there to buff me, damnit" people get to you.  To tie this in to my previous
statement about gnome enchanters, you might want to make exceptions for
enchanters and clerics if at all possible.

Anything beyond "sorry, I can't" is overkill when it comes to apologizing.
