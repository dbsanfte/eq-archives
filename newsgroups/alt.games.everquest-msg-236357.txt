I am trying to decide on the best Cleric race to start with. I know 
stats don't matter so much in the long run with stat boosting items but 
I am going to be playing at a slower pace than some and the quality of 
my character at lower levels matters. Here are the three races I am 
considering and thier starting stats as published in the Prima Guides:

      Froglok Dwarf High Elf
STR  75      95    60
STA  85      95    70
AGI  100     70    85
DEX  100     90    70
WIS  85      93    105
INT  75      60    92
CHA  50      45    80

I want my cleric to be the best survivor possible when taking hits, wise 
enough to be a capable healer for my group and being on the intelligent 
side for crafting would be nice. CHA is nice but only the High Elf has 
it... STR may not be an extremely important thing because others in my 
group can do the looting. This character isn't going to solo much if at 
all, except at the very start.

I like the Froglok for his high AGI with decent STR and STA. INT is 
decent too. I'd likely put 25 pts into WIS and 5 pts into STR or STA 
with this guy.

I like the Dwarf because he's tough with highest STR and STA. Better WIS 
than Froggie but not as good as High Elf might be important though in 
lower levels?  I'd likely put 25 pts into WIS and 5 pts into AGI with 
this guy.

I like the High Elf for great WIS, great INT, good CHA and better AGI 
than Dwarf although not as good as Froggie. STA is a real concern for 
the High Elf though. It's tempting to put 25 pts into WIS with this guy 
and be really wise but that would only leave 5 pts to throw into STA.

Given my goals for this character, what do you guys think is the best 
race and why? I guess for a Cleric WIS ought to be the most important 
consideration and perhaps this is why I would guess High Elves are a 
popular choice for a cleric. It's a drag they are weak and frail though. 
I like how the Dwarf is stout, too bad he isn't a little more 
intelligent. I think Frogloks are cool but the low starting WIS worries 
me. So any thoughts or suggestions you guys have would be most 
appreciated. I need to figure this out today as my guild is waiting for 
me to roll this character and add him to the roster. Then I need to get 
rolling with him as they are all around 5 to 10 in level at this point. 
It's a small casual family kind of guild that is going to play together 
from early levels up to 50 or so and then decide where to go from there. 
This is why I care a lot about being a good character from the start 
with a strong emphasis on being very good in a group.

Thanks for reading my long post! I'll look forward to reading what you 
guys have to say.
