While I am far from normal in my leveling as over 120 days played on a
32 Warrior will attest, it isnt a matter of not KNOWING where to level
but let me say this: Enjoy the game and dont get caught up on having
to level.  Let the levels come as a result of the fun, not the other
way around.  

For me, I went the following.

I played a "normal" game thru about 17 then the brakes went on.  

Human Warrior starting in Freeport

1-5 West Freeport Newbie Zone
6 to 9 East Commons, soloing and doing the Orc Camps
9 to 15 West Commons, East Commons and Desert of Northern Ro
15 to 17 Nro and Oasis
17  to 21 Highpass Hold and West Commons
21 to 26 Lake of Ill Omen
27 to 29 Frontier Mountains
29 to current has been mostly in Great Divide and Iceclad with a
little time spent at the forth in Frontier Mountains.

At around 25 I started getting invites to SolA (never went).  I get a
lot of invites to do Giants/Spectres in Oasis and to Lake Rathe as
well.

Highpass is great for your Druid.  The zone is much more open now
although you may still have to wait for a camp at the Gnolls or the
Orcs as they are often full depending on when you play.  Gnolls are
lower and the groups there tend to be 15 to 18.  The Orcs are better
experience but you earn it more and depending on the group you can
play there from 15 to 21 although around 20 most move into Highkeep
which is great experience.  Some really nice drops for you as well in
Highpass.  Even if you dont want it, they sell well.

As for how some jump levels quickly, some know the best places and the
best methods and are willing to take the risk.  Like the friend of
mine who took his Druid to Lake of Ill Omen at 14 and would take on
reds.  He just played the odds that he would get more experience
before he died each time.  I dont play that way LOL.    Another I know
does Oasis at 11.  I never even WENT there until 15 and died many
times.  It has a nice experience modifier but for a reason.  High
Reward is the payoff for high risk.

Hope this helps some=)
