Hmm you are right, if what he said was true: "The zone will be
primarily a huge room, we'll have vendors there, bankers there, one zone
away from the teleport into Luclin, and the teleport to Luclin is no farther away
than 5 or 6 zones from anywhere in Norrath."

5 or 6 zones could be any city or any wizard portal, druid ring or dragon circle.
I wonder how that is going to work? Click on the pyramids/spires? Will
we need a key/tooth to operate it?

If the expansion pack is truly for all levels, then 1st level characters need a
way there somehow.
