OK, the short answer is basically 'How uber are you?'

I know it may sound glib, but in essence that's how they work:

Dorf faction: Fully equipped town, port outside, plenty of solo/small
group quests. A few high level quests, plus the coldain ring wuests, one
of the best though out quests in the game imho

Giant faction: Sparse town with the very basics (no tradeskills,
bandages etc), nearest port is guarded by Woushi, nasty dragon. A few
small quests, main quests requiring major raids like Temple of Veeshan.
Some of the best quest armour rewards esp. Tank armour

Dragon faction: Not much known about the town (if there is effectively a
town in Skyshrine) very top end quests. Generally not much info is
known/shared


So, dorf faction is the safer bet for the independent traveller or those
in smaller guilds. Medium/large/uber guilds often chose to base
themselves in Kael because there's more reward for big raids. I don't
know anyone publicly dragon aligned, though I know of several
considering switching based on future information and exploration
