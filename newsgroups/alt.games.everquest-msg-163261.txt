TRUCE!  (I cut out the top portion simply because it's not relevant to 
this post.)  I screwed up on MY interpretation of what you wrote, as I 
didn't even take established netiquette into acount.  </bows in humility>

This statement holds true for both of my statements and your counters, as 
they stem from the same goof.  All I can say is that I beg your 
forgiveness and plead temporary insanity from a week full of stress, 
ALMOST no sleep, and a death in the family (that's why there was stress 
and almost no sleep).


Now, do we then agree that simply by use (for some time) top posting IN 
THIS GROUP is a no-no?  And that thing I wrote about interspaced posting 
still holds true?

<I'm not avoiding a flame war, only avoiding my misunderstanding a post 
erupting INTO one!>

Oh, and since I have NEVER used Outlook, I am not aware of it's "uses" 
and limitations - aside from what I've read about here and in other 
newsgroups.
