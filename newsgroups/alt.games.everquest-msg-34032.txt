I'm with ya there...  I've played my bard for almost a year now, and he's
just recently dinged 17.  But then, I don't have a whole lot of time that I
can dedicate to EQ...  And even then, I get bored with one character, go to
another, etc... I've got like five different characters that I alternate
between...
