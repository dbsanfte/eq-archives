The Reason I wasn't sure was because he was added AFTER Velious, at least I
thought he was.  Figured they could do anything with any faction they wanted
that's added after an expansion was released.  Like all of a sudden seeing a
Coldain dwarf hanging out in Kaladim, or a Kromriff Giant hanging out in the
Fort in Frontier Mountains. I suppose they COULD do it if they REALLY wanted
to.
