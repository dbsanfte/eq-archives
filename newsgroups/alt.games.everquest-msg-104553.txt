    Yeah, that was bizarre. I'd just quested up a Lodizal Shell Shield, and
then I Gated. After the gate I was back at the port circle in Cobalt Scar,
with all the quest items in inventory and without the Shield, and I was
grouped with the druid that had ported me there again. Except that druid had
logged already. VERY bizarre. Lord knows how many people duped items after
it got found out - take someone that hadn't zoned yet, have them drop their
stuff, then gate and get restored to their previous save.

    I also got a few res tells from folks saying Paludal Caverns got "all
messed up". They wouldn't, or couldn't, elaborate. Any idea what happened to
the zone, or was that a server-specific thing? (I'm on Quellious.)
