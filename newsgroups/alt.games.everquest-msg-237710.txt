1 week? 2-3 hours/day? 40th level. That's not "good groups" that's
power levelling. Its not remotely best-of-the best for those who score
their play by how fast they can skip 1/3rd of the games content, but
I'd be willing to bet you spent those 2-3 hours/day in chain-pulling
groups in the traditional PL zones.

As far as hardest to level... these days none of them, really. As
you've demonstrated anyone can run the level-mill quickly and
effortlessly by hanging out in groups in the PL-zones.

Once upon a time it was a pain to get to a bank as a
non-gating/non-binding evil melee/hybrid but with the pok its no
biggie. About the only thing that really matters is the xp penalties
on a few races, but that doesn't make them "harder" to level... it
just means they need more xp per level. It takes a little longer, but
its by no means any harder.
