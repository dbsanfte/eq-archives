So, what is the appeal? I had no use for the ranger class until I saw
someone play one really well and was, afterwards, much more impressed
although I would still never play one myself.

I *still* don't get paladins. It seems like the class loses way too
much end-game utility in favor of a few extra levels of soloability on
the way up.

If it's an RP perspective, I have yet to see an RP paladin that wasn't
played as a humorless prick, often making the player indistinguishable
from the character.
