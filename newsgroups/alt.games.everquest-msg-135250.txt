The time for that is far past.  All we're doing now is keeping the wound
open.  Hell, we've gone past Dr. King's ideals of color blindness, back to
the idea of segregation.  The difference is, this time, it's the minorities
that want to segregate themselves from society.  And now, being racially
color blind is considered racism.

The U.S. Constitution is, itself, a blanket statement of rights.  This is
because it sets up a limited form of govenrment, specifically and
intentionally restricting what governement is allowed to do.  It assumes
that what is not given to the governments is in the hands of the people.

The Bill of Rights is in the Ammendments section for a reason.  When the
Constitution was drafted, it wasn't included.  Many didn't want such a thing
to exist, for fear that it would be taken as an all-inclusive list.

Actually, there is no Constitutional justification for anti-discrimination
laws, as far as they are concerned for private businesses.  I think there is
good moral justification for them, but that's not the same thing.  From a
strict Constitutionalist stand point, the laws are illegal.

OTOH, if someone hates you enough to deny you employment based on your race,
gender, or anything else, your tenure there is not going to be happy if your
force your way in.

Until you add quotas into the picture.  Also, the existance of government
set aside programs for minorities; these are paid for by all taxpayers'
money, they should be open to all.

And your rights are written in clay.  I'd rather have rights (and
restrictions on the govenrment) that are a little more stable than that.
