I know, replying to myself is bad... but I'm not sure I explained my point
very well there.

What I was saying is, I've done the "click heal through downtime" thing, if
for some reason we had to stop pulling for mana.   90+ percent of the time
the healer would be back and ready to go fast enough that I was still hurt
below the level where CH is the most efficient heal.   So it saved nothing.
Same thing with bandaging.
