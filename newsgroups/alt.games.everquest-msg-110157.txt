I performed a similar test, 

In qeynos a 75 agil char human
a 125 agil char half elf. 
I had both do /time with a finger paused on the enter button. I hit
the enter button at the exact moment I started moving. I then chose
the same route out to the right along  the base of the hill, to the
shore by the barbarian enclave in Wk (no one zoned during any of this,
it was strict in the same  zone running) I chose WK because it is one
of the longest straight runs in the game. 

Both chracters then ran as near to the shore as possible, and once
again had /time ready with finger over the enter key as I passed that
guy for the ghoulbane quest near the end of the zone and ran abreast
of a tree near him. The times, were so amazingly close it was
incredible:

11 minutes 17 seconds for the 75 agil char
11 minutes 18 seconds for the 125 agil char

Agil makes zero diff. 

I then made similar tests with dwarves of different types and such and
found that in every case the largest variance I had was 3 seconds,
EVER and more often than not the character with the lower agil would
be a couple seconds faster just due to possible experimenting error. 

That, and others people's tests, prove categorically that agil has
zero affect on run speed. If it did, a character with FIFTY MORE AGIL
would certainly have a noticeable difference. We can say that 50 more
stamina at level 20 makes a noticeable difference in HP since you can
SEE IT. The difference is moderately large and quite obvious.

Exactly.
