One of my guildmates used to leave corpses of his mage everywhere with the 
epic in hand.  It's no-rent, but it stays on a corpse until the corpse 
decays.  He got a LOT of tells from people asking if he knew he had a 
corpse with epic on it rotting in <insert well-traveled zone here>.  Now 
he plays a rogue, which I think is much more his style, but I still see 
sparkly Flamyst corpses every now and then.
