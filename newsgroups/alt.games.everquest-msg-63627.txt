Heck no!  I'm -savin'- those points.  Haven't decided yet whether to use 
them to master Orcish or Hand-to-Hand... or Throwing maybe.  But all of 
those are far harder, in my opinion, to raise than research.  Just go skim 
vendors the last night before a patch, and you can build up a fine 
collection of research components in no time.

}Even with maxed research, Id sooner get a level 50+ necro to make up
}my spells for me, cos I dont want to risk losing those components. Ive never
}found a problem getting someone to make them up for me.

Hehe, that's what I did.  Had all my 49 spells made and scribed before I 
got research up to 25. :)  But now I'm over 50, so I'm working up my 
research when I have time, against the day some younger enchanter asks me 
for the same aid. :)

I'd also love trivial information.  I searched the web with a fine-toothed 
comb and came up blank.  Mythiran.allakhazam.com had information on when 
the practice runes trivial (oh, how useful...) but not the spells 
themselves.  I haven't worked out any trivials myself, but I may have 
enough extra runes gathered that my wizard will have a shot at finding 
some as she levels.  It seems as if all spells of a particular circle have 
the same trivial, and I suspect that the trivials will also be 
class-independent (ie, 29th level necro, mage, wiz, enc spells should all 
trivial the same).  So that narrows it down to just a few numbers we 
need...
