I'm sorry, I must very strongly disagree with you here.

DT made a number of excellent points.  If you can't disagree
with them without simply throwing up your hands and pretending
that he didn't *have* any, then perhaps your own position is
not as defensible as you like to believe.

He's absolutely right -- in fighting monsters, you must be
careful not to become one yourself.  This is not such a
subtle point that you could have overlooked it, so I have
to suspect that you've purposely chosen to not to hear it.

If you have no rebuttal, fine, but don't pretend that he
didn't have something to say.
