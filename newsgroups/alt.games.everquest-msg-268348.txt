The label actually warns against ingesting it orally.  I somehow doubt 
there's a clear agreed upon definition of how much ingested liquid 
constitutes "drinking" it, nor do I think it's particularly relevant.

I don't think it actually matters.  Perhaps you didn't understand, but the 
point is:

Don't ingest Visine.  It can be very, very bad.

In fact, I know you didn't understand, because you were absolutely stupid 
enough to do it in some jocular posture just to prove a point to someone on 
usenet.  Are you even aware that if you were highly suseptible to the active 
ingredient in Visine (which is why warning labels generally warn against 
levels far below typical danger levels) that you could be in a coma with 
permanent brain damage right now?  All over some spiteful conversation on 
usenet:  You are staggeringly idiotic.


Why do you

I'm not sure, but it could be when you told a guy to ignore warning labels 
and think for himself.   You cannot simply avoid this by claiming you were 
talking only about Snopes.   Snopes was merely documenting why warning 
labels appear on Visine, and what ingesting it can do you.

And besides, what sort of fucked up utility are you advocating when you say 
that it's okay to ingest a few drops Visine, just don't down the whole 
bottle?  Why do you think that distinction even needs to be made, going so 
far as to endanger yourself to make it?

I also

I don't care about what else you said in this thread.  I was merely 
responding to the claim that Talon was being an unthinking drone for 
believing that warning labels might actually be trying to warn him of 
something, rather than trying to manipulate his weak mind.

You can think that someone who thinks two drops of Visine ingested orally 
might kill you is stupid, but I think you're stupid for even bothering to 
make that distinction.   Who gives a shit?   What good is the knowledge that 
there's a safe level of Visine you can drink before it kills you?  There's 
never any need to drink Visine in the first place.  The stupid person who 
thinks two drops of Visine can kill you is smart enough to avoid all the bad 
possible effects of drinking Visine, which is smarter than you've 
demonstrated yourself to be.

Like I said, you can go get your bottle of ColorGuard Cheer and slurp some 
down to determine that ingesting small amounts of it won't kill you, but why 
even bother in the first place?  What possible important point could be made 
in making such a distinction?  And why tell people that they need to come to 
their own conclusions on it?

You know, if you had merely stated that products like Visine wouldn't be on 
the market if incidental ingestion through ordinary use could have such an 
effect on a person, I wouldn't have had any issue with you.  But that's not 
what you said, is it?
