 Yes, that seems to be the case. Our clerics with it are only hitting
one group. So it seems that for AoE it's intended to be used in
conjunction with the skill thing. 41 targets though every 72 minutes
(recycle time on the skill)?  Helpful to get things initially going but
after that seems a waste. However you can still do group so I guess
you're saving 2 dots each time.
