I think he's in Molten Core.  I've heard that Conquest has managed to
defeat the first sub-boss in there, but they've still got a way to go
to reach the end.

I'm curious whether the post-Onyxia raid is in--she's supposed to
unlock access to someone else.

It'd have been nice, but it really doesn't bother me much.  There's so
much to do from 1-60 that they have a fair bit of time before they need
more high-level content.
