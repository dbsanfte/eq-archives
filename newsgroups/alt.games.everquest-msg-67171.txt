I've seen this issue debated one way and another, and now have a
definitive answer.

Near total wipeout on a VS raid, only a couple FD and a few people
including a paladin managed to camp (We'll be having a talk later about
the "few people" who quit out instead of aggroing VS in order to help
the clerics camp)

I lost 54 by a hair, looks like one or two kills will get me it back.
I've resed myself
while down almost 2 blue back into 53 twice now (quite a learning curve
on Luclin, lol) so there is no doubt that an exp res would have redinged
me.

Although I was pretty sure this wouldn't work, I agreed to get a revive
and then try to res myself.  The res worked (I got the confirmation
message, lost C2 and all mana and most HP) but I got no exp back at all.

Now under the circumstances, this was -the- option, and I took the
revive fully aware that I likely was sacrificing the exp in order to get
in there and give everyone else -their- lost exp back... but now that I
have a definitive answer, I won't bother resing myself after getting
that revive, which cost me the med time for 700 mana plus we had to get
C2 cast on me a second time.

Also, since I have a definitive answer, if getting back to the body
requires only some travel time, I'll go with the travel time instead of
taking the paladin shortcut.  Getting a Revive is strictly for heroes.
