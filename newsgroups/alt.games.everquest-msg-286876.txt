> At the higher levels, some mobs have the ability to "rampage", which is a
> special attack directed at the first person on the mob's "rampage list",
> not counting whoever the mob is currently fighting.  The rampage list is
> separate from the aggro list (also called the "hate list"); the aggro list
> changes order based on how much damage each player has done, what spells
> have been cast (including healing other players on the aggro list), and
> various other factors.  In general, the mob will try to attack whoever's at
> the top of its aggro list.  The rampage list, however, stays in the same
> order, with each player getting added as they aggro the mob.  This is where
> the ST (secondary tank) comes in: they aim to be the second person to get
> aggro after the MT.  Then, when the mob rampages, the extra attack gets
> directed against the ST who, being a tank, is prepared to take the damage.
