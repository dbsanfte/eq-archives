In an effort to get my 2 boxing a little more stable and lag free I'm going to 
make some changes to my setup.  Currently I only have 1 EQ directory and 
simply load EQW twice.  I leave all options the same for both copies that 
are running so I'm running the full models and full sound in both.  It 
works but sometimes it is very laggy.  I'm going to copy my EQ directory and 
make a 2nd one.  This 2nd copy I just want to use the old models and I want to 
disable sound.  I know I can disable the sound in-game, but how do I set the 
models to use the old/less graphic itensive ones?  Also is there anything else 
I should change in my 2nd copy to make the game run smoother?
