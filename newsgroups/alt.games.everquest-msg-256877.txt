We go the opposite direction.  All mobs are the same value.  There are some
modifiers, such as "farm status" which halves the value, and "new" which
doubles it, and "fail" which halves it again.  The items have a base
starting price based on a set of criteria that applies to all items, and are
bid up from that base price, highest bid wins the item.

I think I could run a merit system just fine, but I also think that even if
I never showed the slightest hint of favoritism, some people would complain
of favoritism.  In guilds with stricter attendance requirements than mine,
I can see how it could work out well.
