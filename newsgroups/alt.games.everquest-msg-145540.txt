In general those who just moseyed their way up to 50 on the
LoIO/FM/OT/DL chain aren't very highly regarrded for either their
playing skill or their ingame knowledge. A higher rung than an
ebayite, maybe, but not much.

But, you said you didn't want alternate advice, so I am sure you'd
ignore anyone telling you to get into a well populated guild that can
make its own pickup groups to go much better places, right?
