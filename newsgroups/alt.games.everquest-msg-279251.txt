	Yeah. You know, I could possibly solo a DoN mission. You DO get 6 hours 
for them. I guess there may be some sort of line between the physically 
possible and vaguely practisable.

	Anyhow, the point I was trying make was (kinda got bured there :) that 
you can easily obtain the item so you think it's easily obtainable. 
Unfortunately, what's easily obtainable to you can be hell to obtain for 
others who are wearing crap (non-raid) gear.

	I have rarely spent that much on my main. I've rarely had it :)

	Could you provide the magelo links for these? I find this interesting.

	Good :)

	Your hyperbole :P

	Not my current guild. The previous guild without any raid gear. The 
guys in LDoN Stuff... back when we were all 65. The current guild think 
of flagging for KT as a minor irritation :P

	I'm raiding 3 nights a week now, two of them in Time, and I think this 
system is seriously imbalanced.
