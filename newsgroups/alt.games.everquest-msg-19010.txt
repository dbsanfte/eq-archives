Players that want SoW all the time, should play bloody characters that can
cast SoW!!    Otherwise they should never "expect" to be given SoW on
demand. When you are asking someone for SoW, its nice if it's put a little
better than SoW plz, hell, they are interrupting your play, albeit only for
a few seconds, but still , the least they could do is be arsed to type a few
extra words and be damn polite about it!...they are wanting you to give them
something, least they can do!
As for asking someone to SoW you when you are already in the middle of doing
something, and then to hassle you about it!, don't understand how anyone
could possibly want to defend the guy, he's too rude, too selfish, after
all, the druid wants to play the game too, he's not be a service provider.
