I have Shaman & Rogue, sure people say a rogue can't tank etc. I have no
trouble with this duo. The shaman slows (mob mad at shaman) rogue backstabs
until it turns, shaman poisons, rogue backstabs until it turns, evade BS,
shaman pet slamming on it. I am still duo'ing fine at 57, and getting groups
is easy as well.

Now, would I do this if I started all over again, probably not, just because
the availability of gear is so high. I would go Iksar Shaman & Ogre Shadow
Knight. Sure you will need some faction (or wolf form) to do the shaman's
epic, but you also get access to the iksar club which is well worth it.
