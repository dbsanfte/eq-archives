I know I find it icky...

That's why I kill and skin gnolls, orcs, and other humanoids instead, HAR
HAR HAR! (that's that Tim Allen Tool Time noise, for those of you who
remember that).  

(/waves to Zardak who she knows is lurking in these forums)

When I think about it a little more...I've heard it said that women are
more likely to identify with their character, and therefore more likely to
choose a race/class that is "themselves".  I would imagine most women
(damn the stereotypes...some of them have a grain of truth) gravitate
towards nurturing, hence the clerics.  And there is a high percentage of
pagan/environmentalist women in the fantasy community so you see an equal
smattering of druids (ok, half of them are men playing it, but druids and
clerics are THE two most prevalent classes among female players).

The third most common "group" amongst female characters, I would guess,
are the dark elf women of any class.  All that angst...mmm...

I think those of us who like mucking about in the woods, getting bruised
and scraped up, with leaves in our hair and up to our elbows and knees in
mud and briars (and who don't care if we look pretty while we do it)...and
dont' give a damn about nurturing your lily white pansy ass...aren't quite
as common.  

Could be wrong though.  :)  Just a wild theory.
