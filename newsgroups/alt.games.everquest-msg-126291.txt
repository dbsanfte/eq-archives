or anywhere in the log window (hit a key or combination of keys and use the
word where the cursor is sitting as the target).

Anyway, just a couple of things that I would like to see, off the top of my
head, are:

a) automatic EQUAL splitting of cash to anyone in the group who has
autosplit on (when the first-looter has autosplit on).

b) ATMs in every zone or, at least, in a lot of the commercial areas, just
for depositing, changing and retrieving cash (or even just allow merchants
to change up).

c) a simple way of targetting someones pet (e.g. in a group,  F2/3/4 etc.
targets the players so why not alt-F2/3/4 etc. to target their pet)

d) cancelling Track without having to bring up the track window and click on
cancel (and why does the track window disappear when you display inventory?)

e) accurate health display without having to sit under the long arm of the
sand giant
