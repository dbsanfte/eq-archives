There are *dozens* of reasons why a big mana pool is important, adds for
instance or maybe tossing a heal/SoW at someone in trouble. I've probably
stood up to save someone a 1,000 times playing this game. Tell them I
shouldn't have put points into my mana pool on my characters so I can finish
a fight with a bubble left.

I think my record is five straight resists and a fizzle on a level
appropriate mob before I got something to stick. I don't think it helps you
kill things faster, I think it increases options when things go bad.
