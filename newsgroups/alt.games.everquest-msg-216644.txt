WRONG! This used to be true, but it was changed a LONG time ago. If
you look at the stats on muffins, it says something like "this is a
snack". That means you'll go through 'em like popcorn. Rations say
"this is a meal", Iron Rations "this is a hearty meal". That little
description is a clue-in to how long the food item lasts. It makes no
difference if the food was baked or vendor bought when it comes to the
message and how long it lasts.

Drinks have a similar system. "Whistle wetters" are equivalent to
snacks, "refreshing drink", I think, equates to hearty meals, etc.
