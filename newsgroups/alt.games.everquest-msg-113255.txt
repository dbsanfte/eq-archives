Kind of unrelated, but you tripped off the thought train, so you get to
hear it anyway....

I was in Crushbone the other night killing some time while I revised and
waited for some friends (ok, dont ask  how those are compatible ;) ) and
popped myself hidden up on orc trainer hill, randomly casting skin like
steel, force of nature, thorns, sow, and heals on the littluns hunting
orcs for fun.... I especially paid attention to the under level 10's who
were having a hard time being "starved out" by some high level faction
hunters.

All fun and joy.... until I get the "cn I see yor swiftwand plz"

Now, I dont know why, but these sort of  "you owe me doods" seem to travel
in packs... pretty shortly the warriors druid friend is in front of me
demanding I powerlevel him, sitting to maintain eye contact when I sit
to med, standing when I stand to cast, blocking my line of sight, stopping
me targetting newbies in need, and so on.

The warrior and druid are both twinked silly.

I move to the entrance and sit.... randomly buffing the newbies still, and
suddenly one of them pops on a private "friends" chat channel I have... it
turns out to be someone I know in "hiding" guise.... delighted at my
largesse... we get gossiping a little and suddenly, without any shout to
the zone, Dvinn, Crush and the prophet hurtle in front of me and stop.

By all the little orc pawn and centurions for the low levels.

And they proceed to start annhilating the newbies who are merrily enjoying
their newfound "invincibility".... I make the foolish mistake of immediately
jumping up and slaughtering DVinn, as I did earlier in the day when someone
trained him to zone trying to mistake, and then it dawns on me... that freaking
druid is deliberately using me to space out the nameds so he can get XP off
stuff he couldnt solo pull, annhilating the innocent newbies as he does
so.

Growl. Next time I'm going to just sit and watch him die even if the newbies
die too... the newbies dont lose XP , but he was level 18. Little sod.

Sigh.. and then to top this all off I wandered round to the slaver area, playing
in character, delighted to see elves out "helping" their kin, buff them silly,
gossip in character... then begin to watch the faction scrolling up my screen.

Funny idea of "helping" you little bastards!

Sui, Faction work to do for kelethin and felwithe now....
