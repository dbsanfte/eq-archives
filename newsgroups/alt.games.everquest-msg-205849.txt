Actually, what Kaev said was that if you are not looking up far enough to 
begin with, then, you will sink when your stamina bar runs out.  Slight, 
but important difference there.

Your statements at least appear to imply that you will sink when your 
stamina runs out, and that you must be actively at the keyboard to stop 
yourself from doing so.  This is not the case.
