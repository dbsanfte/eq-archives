I argue, in fact, that to have a pure roleplaying environment, those
kinds of rules are REQUIRED. Weed out those who ignore roleplay for
the sake of purely griefing, because they do more damage to the RP
environment than the presence of such moderation could do.

Also, there are plenty of ways to establish RP-themed regulation of
PvP. In-character laws and law enforcement teams, to put it simply.
The "moderation" can be done in a manner that minimizes its damage to
the RP environment through such means. (Banning of a very OOC griefer
could be done in the form of the "men with the white jackets" dragging
said griefer off to the insane asylum. ;) )
