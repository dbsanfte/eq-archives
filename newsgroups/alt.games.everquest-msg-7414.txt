Hi everyone,

I've been working in my workshop again. :-)
If you are interested in trying out the latest beta version of my
eqclient.ini editor, you can get it from
"http://www.geocities.com/thorgrud/". (You'll need to scroll down to the 
bottom of the page since I accidently put all my messages in reverse
order when I first made the web page. I still need to fix this.) 

This version still has a couple of things with which I'm not done
tinkering, but over all I think it is pretty good. If you do give it a
try please email me and let me know what you think. I'm a tough dwarf, I
can take it. ;-) 

Thorgrud
