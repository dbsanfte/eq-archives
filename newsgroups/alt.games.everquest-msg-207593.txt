Map at;
http://www.eqatlas.com/warrensmap.html

The *character* in question is 22nd (magelo profile was given) and will
begin to draw aggro after passing Pit Fighter room (not marked on map but it
is the large L shaped room at the top of the map)
Camo will help but the Shaman in (and around) the Throne room will often
cast Spirit Sight on other Kobolds it seems (that or some Elders and Leaders
can see invis) which normally means, upon exiting the Throne Room (11 on
Map) you will have yourself a train.
Taking lefts will get him to and passed the Cave Bat Lord's room (13) but if
you look at the map you will run into the Mighty Bear Paw. Combined with the
following train that would mean squished assling...not necassarily a bad
thing but not what the OP had in mind I am certain.

To the OP, follow John's advice of take every left. Then, when you get to
the throne room (you will know when you are there) stick to the left wall
and don't look back once past the Cave Bat Lords room (he may not be up, is
killed a lot by passers by) which you can recognise by the mound that sits
in the middle of it, take the right not the left, on the map this room is
unmarked as there is nothing of interest but some kobolds in there but
taking a left will head to room 14 and a nasty bear/kodiak who won't be
happy to see you.
