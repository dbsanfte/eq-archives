/nod, I plan to use the same gear for a long time though...too much of a hassle
IMO replacing stuff...so I'd rather get +int than +mana.

Plan on either getting something really cheap for temporary use or borrowing a
smoldering brand from the guild. I also have enough CB belts to (I think) get
to ~12. So I can hopefully go straight to Oasis.

She is too tough, however a good mid-forties group can take the room. The robe
isn't really too expensive now, anyway.

Uh-oh...how hellishly rare? I was planning on replacing the Kunzar Cloak with
Cloak of the Ice Bear so I'd have 200 int instead of 202 (figured 20 hp and 20
svc would benefit more than 2 int), but apparently that won't work out if I
don't get those boots. I guess I'll use the Kunzar after all, or find some
other +int boots...although the only no-drop ones I see are GEBs, which are way
out of my league anyway.
