Why do I have the feeling that most of those bitching (note I didnt say you)
are those that cannot afford it.  Those "happy" about the change (such as
yourself) are those that cannot afford them at their current price.  Welp.
I've EARNED my right to a Fungi Tunic (as in looted directly off of ole king
himself) and hmmm.. I would like to put it on any character I please.

It's like this.  I've fought bats, beetles, orcs, derv's, orc highway, loio
trash, fm/ot garbage, etc (just about in that order too) and ya know what?
It's a funkin bore... HOWEVER, what ISNT a bore is the chance to play a new
class, with new abilities, spells, etc..  It's these -classes- that are
keeping me in the game AND the fact that I own a fungi among other things
that I have EARNED.  So.  If they do nerf the fungi (retro that is, since it
obviously wont phase me if non-retro) then well, I aint going through that
bat, beetle, orc, dervs, etc bullshit again with every different
class/race/deity combo I may make.  Oct 1999, I've earned my right to use a
manastone, fungi, etc that I looted.  Sheit, it's the least that they could
keep available to me for, errm, monthly fees... I wont go into fact that I
have three Luclin enabled accounts (including preceeding expansions).

Oh well.  Those that can afford a fungi (or can obtain it) will argue they
feel they shouldnt nerf it, or atleast retroactively.  Those that cannot
afford one or are oh so disgusted (for whatever reason) of "twinking" will
praise the day they do nerf the fungi in one way or another.

But, oh yeah, I've got answers to all the situations/thoughts:

Complaint.  I hope they do retroactively nerf the fungi so I can get one for
my 50+ whatever.
Comment:   Sooo, you want others to get raped so that you get the sexual
pleasure?

Complaint:  Good nerf them, Im tired of twinking.
Comment: Twinking DIRECTLY affects you HOW? (dont mention that it affects
you simply because you dont like it, else us for twinking could do the same
thing and then its one big funkin circle)

Complaint: Its too powerful
Comment:  I have one and I have still died many a times.  Must not be THAT
powerful huh?

The real issue is... people are bitching and complaining about the fungi and
how it should be nerfed.. <shrug>  Would you like 100kpp handed to you as
well?  Stop your bitchin, make friends, get level 60, get a decent guild
(guild names such as "Forever Friends" usually dont qualify), get a king
group and go get yourself a damn fungi.

BTW.  If they DID retroactively nerf Fungi's, I believe there would be
enough veterans that would have gotten fed up and left the game, DESTROYING
your precious fungi that you want cheaper.  Atleast, if it IS retroactive,
you can bet your ass my fungi will be destroyed....  Oh, to cover for the
statements I can just hear stirring up in your lungs.....  I'll be sure the
door doesnt hit my ass.
