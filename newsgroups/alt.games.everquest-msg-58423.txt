While pulling Tormax ramp on Sunday, we got talking about stats and stuff..
the 60 paladin had 5.5khp and 1450ac compared to the 60 warrior MA who had
1150 (ish) AC and about 4kHP (there was no 60 cleric or shaman there, so
thats not fully buffed)

What a sharp difference huh.. of course, the Paladin was from the uberest
guild on our server (the only ones capabale of (and succesful) in killing
the 4th warder)

What the Paladin said though "Dont worry, i have more HP and AC then *some*
of the KtF warriors too"   (KtF being the Pali's guild who woke the
sleeper).

What that says to me is gear for gear, warriors do have more AC and HP then
any other class (which is what I think) because that Paladin must be close
to his ideal gear to have those kindof stats - and there are still multiple
warriors in his guild with better AC and HP then his.
