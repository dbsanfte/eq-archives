Totally agree.  And Allakhazams - and Monual's site too - often list the HP of
the mob, the spells the mob casts, how hard the mob hits, that kind of thing. 
Also how many HP / AC the tanks have, how many in the raid itself and how many
healers are required in what function.    
I'm also finding alot of contradictory information on Alla's... which doesn't
mean anyone's wrong, different strategy will also be required depending on your
raid force.  (Example:  Innoruuk in Nadox.  One guy says use CH rotation,
another one said not to.  Another said that you could hide behind the walls).
I've already learned on my own that faction, or lack thereof, also counts.
I guess maybe i should have *raid specific* instead of *cleric specific*.
