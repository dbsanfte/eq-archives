Dont really see much benefit to this. I imagine west freport will bcome the
new auction zone, due to relaxed npc faction, and it centralness, so all the
poor newbies hunting the bats will have to put up with the aution spam
instad.

Nodrop is unrealistic. No being able to drop an item ive picked up is
unrealistic, barring things like it being covered with insta-glue. (the mind
boggles)
