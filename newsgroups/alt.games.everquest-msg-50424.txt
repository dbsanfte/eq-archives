Lots of discussions on this topic in the past, check deja news for much
info. Short answer is you can't go wrong with either Alteration or
Evocation. You can always reset later. If you like being a healer in the
group, Alt is the way to go. If you like quad kiting (you will by level 36)
Evo is nice, but some would argue you shouldn't be betting your life on
specialization bonus.

Alteration will usually win if left to nature because Alt spells are
typically cast more often. Remember, though, casting a spell school more
often doesn't mean you spend more mana in that school. Specialization
improves on the number of casts, but it affects mana utilization.

BTW, DOT's definitely damage MOBs when they are chasing you. Damage is
reduced by 1/3 (2/3 damage is done) if they are pursuing you.
