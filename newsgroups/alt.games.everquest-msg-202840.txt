It still floors me to see people in the PoK asking for ports to EJ or
Skyfire.  Both the Cab book and the OT book, respectively, drop you so
close.

I'll offer to SoE them for free so that they can make the run easier, and
once in a while I'll get a taker who says "Wow, I hadn't thought of that."
But by and large, the response is that they're used to dropping into those
zones at the druid port-it spot, and that's where they want to go.

/shrug.  If you'd rather donate than learn a new way to get around, one
that'll actually make your life easier in the long run (so to speak), I'll
take your plat, I suppose.
