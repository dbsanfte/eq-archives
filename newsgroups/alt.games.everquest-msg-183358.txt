No, I think that would be high horse riding cleric land where that is the 
mentality. A battlefield medic doesn't expect you to carry your own 
morphine, penicillin, smallpox vaccine or even bandages. 

I understand full well the expense involved in keeping stocked with dots 
and such. That is why I firmly believe that clerics should be compensated. 
However, I can't imagine a cleric worth their salt not being prepared with 
the necessary components.
