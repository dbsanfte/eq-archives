I don't remember the name of the mob, but no, it is not out of the
way.  He is part of either the forager or hunter cycle, which means
he--and other named mobs--will spawn from time to time as you kill the
frogs you need to get the Seb keys.  So just have your rangers keep
their eyes open for named mobs on track as you keep killing for the
key pieces.
