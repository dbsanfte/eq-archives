Has anyone sold their EQ account that they no longer use?

I stopped playing EQ and wondered if there are people out there intersted in
accounts.

I have one account on Saryrn with all expansions up to and including Legacy
of Ykesha.
My characters are only a 46 Cleric and 35 or something Beastlord, neither
has really good armor.

How much do you think this would go for?
Any help helps, i'm thinking of playerauctions.com\
