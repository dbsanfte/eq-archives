Heh  - I find sitting around frustrating.  Today we were running a pretty
routine MSands group in BoT, when someone dropped 3 mobs on us - the ranger
(who I used to be guilded with, but hadn't played with since I was 62 or
so on my mage) called for an evac as soon as she saw all the mobs - the
druid is used to simply hitting exodus when she see's the call.  Thing is,
the original mob was dead, all 3 adds were either 65% or 75% slow and 
all of them spread out and 2 rooted by the time the call came.  Her comment
after was "Sorry, forgot who I was playing with."
