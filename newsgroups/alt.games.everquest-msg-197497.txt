I'm sure this doesn't need to be said, but just in case...

This game is nothing at all like Everquest.  It is a "gotcha" game, where
people accumulate scores by getting other people to click on their links.

Mr. dogSZ has violated the rules of this game by posting the link on a news
group and has been reported for this abuse.
