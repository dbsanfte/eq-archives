I've been playing the beta for about a day now (and have just left the
starter island and am taking my citizenship test) and from what I've
seen, not too many people are going to be complaining.

I was in Anarchy Online and SWG when they first came out, and they
were shocking.

So far, everything's excellent - and I even sent off a /bug report !

Of course, I'm still in the starter areas, so these might just be
really polished compared to the rest of the game.

And the crafting system is fantastic !  Last play session I made a
couple of chests and some scrolls with enhanced abilities  (Sneak III
and Sneak Attack III).

So far, so great - I'm leaving my preorder in place.

They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
Bunnies !  Bunnies !  It must be BUNNIES !
