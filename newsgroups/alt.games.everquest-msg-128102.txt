I don't share account info because it's expressly forbidden in the EULA
and I follow the EULA to the letter.

That said...

Say I did, hypothetically speaking, give my account info to a trusted
guildie. That trust, to me, is far more important than the actual
character. The *only* reason I'm still playing is the people around me.
If I didn't trust them enough to not abuse my password, I wouldn't give
it to them. If they abused that trust, I wouldn't want to be guilded
with them. If I wasn't guilded with them, I wouldn't be playing EQ
anyway. So, I'd feel I had absolutely nothing to lose by a select few
close in-game friends having my password, hypothetically speaking of
course. It's a risk, but a risk I've evaluated and chosen to take. Or at
least I would've if this wasn't all hypothetical. Which it is.
