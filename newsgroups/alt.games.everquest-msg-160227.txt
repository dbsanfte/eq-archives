It is, but it answers your question in your previous post.....

"I would think I could access the bazaar or chat and stuff.  So anyone
know of any program that works?"

I have a friend, who knows this girl, who dates this guy, who has a
cousin that uses EQW. EQW does NOT hack or modify any EQ files. It
simply runs EQ in a window instead of full-screen mode. If you are a
Win2000 or WinXP user that has "fat fingers" and mistakenly hits the
Windows key instead of ALT or CTRL, EQ won't crash if you are using
EQW....at least that's what I have heard :-P.
