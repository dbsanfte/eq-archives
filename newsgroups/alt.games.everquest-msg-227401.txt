I tried to set up a point based system with my guild. I kept tab of points. Only way you got points was when someone
would send me a tell thanking us (guild) for someone assisting them in something. (ie. corpse retrieving. etc.)
or when you show up for meeting, raids, etc. Problem was everyone kept nagging about points and when noone who was online 
showed up for a meeting and i deducted points for it they whined and bitched about it. so we said screw it. If i get an item from a raid
i give it to whoever i feel like from now on.
