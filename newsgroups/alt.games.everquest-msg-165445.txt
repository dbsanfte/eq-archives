The only problem I see there is that brother SOLD the account.

Quote - "sells it."

If that hadn't happened then all you need do is make an account in Brothers
name with his original email address, you/her/the toothfairy pays for new
account then transfer is not a problem...They will ask why the billing
details are different between the original and the new and you just say he's
paying you cash on your card, making up some story about how he could not
trust himself with anymore credit cards having built up too much debt with
them..etc...Transfer Character from Old account in his name to New account
in his name, give new account over to Sister.
You have contact with all members involved and so have all their personal
details available to be able to do this, the transfer of characters to
accounts only becomes a problem when you have bought the account and don't
have all the original details.

Now, this reading comprehension, what did we miss?
