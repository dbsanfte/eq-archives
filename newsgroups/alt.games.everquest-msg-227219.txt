If you're doing a 22 collect theres more than 22 items in the dungeon. So if
one of the items is on your pet you can still win, it just might take a
little longer. Of course if you had 5-10 pets that got killed that would
probably slow you down a lot. Its quite possible every one had an item on
it. IMO thats the chance you take and in the future tell the healer to heal
your 'effin pet.
