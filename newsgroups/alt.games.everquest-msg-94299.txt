On Rodcet they have been repeating the same scripted quest several times
(about 3-4 times per week) over the last few weeks,
where about 100 bixies spawn at either the mouth of EC tunnel and head
outward in to EC or the same amount of bixies
spawn at the entrance to Nektulos and fly out towards inn 1.

Also i have seen and heard of a WC quest (also scripted by the look of it)
being repeated on both Rodcet and Cazic,
 in this one they spawn a hoard of HG's, Griffins and Werewolves at EC
zoneline in WC and they all fly,run and lumber
thier way westward into the west commons, causing player counts to quickly
reach 150's when everyone and thier
uncle gate in from wherever they are.

So as far as i have seen there has been very few actual GM controlled (well
GM's set them up and kick them off)
events where GM's play quest characters, atleast on those 2 servers.
