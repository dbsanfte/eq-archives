<snip bob's story>

Well, I have to admit I have been in a similar situation.

Having not used the bazaar until recently (6 months into playing) I saw a
/ooc for a WTB or trade on a fungal tunic.
I did a search on fungal tunics and could only find the fungal membrane
tunic.
After having not long returned from PC with a couple of tunics, I thought
"Great!" and sent a tell.
He changed from just a straight trade to wanting 70k as well.
I told him I would be lucky to have 200pp to rub together.  He was still
willing to trade, and I said that I would throw a second fungal tunic in.
So off I go to meet him outside of the bank, thinking I had made a rpetty
good deal, the swap item was pretty good, had a few pluses on it.
He's giving me the hurry up to get to the bank (darn lag, you're either slow
from that or 'cause you don't know your way around!!!).
I finally get there and we open the trade window, I put the two fungal
tunics in and he puts the Robe of Flames in.
....well you can already guess what happened from there......../tell  blah
blah newbie..... /tell blah blah waste my time...etc.

Now, I can normally accept a fair amount of criticism, but I think he went
over the top.
I sent him back a tell agreeing with him (well, I am a newbie by most
definitions I guess), but I also suggested that maybe he be a bit more
constructive in his criticism as I would prefer not to peeve anyone off in
the future if I can help it. (no answer on that by the way).

It wasn't until later I saw an /ooc for a fungus tunic (not fungal) and the
price on it...no wonder he was cranky!!!
