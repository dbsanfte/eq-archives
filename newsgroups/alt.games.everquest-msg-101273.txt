You really need to stop tokin when you post, man...  Your original rant was
'Oh, I'll just give you this rez instead of the rez you wanted.' and then
you followed up by 'If my guild is doing something in Gfay, I damn want to
have to get there to join them.'

Problem is...  Is both deals with time in itself.  Rezzes require you to
get it done within 3 hours.  Sure, you will take whatever rez you can get,
but some people don't want to go through several more hours to reclaim the
xp, looking for the extra 6% if they can get it.  This is the same
situation for ports.  You want to be at a specific location, but your
example was that you need to get there at a specific time.  So then...  You
are in a zone that has a few port capable druids, fewer port capable
wizards.  The majority of the port capable wizards are currently engaged in
an XP grind, not feeling inclined or wanting to leave their group to port
someone, even at more than 10pp.

Being a druid... I have turned down large port offerings because I felt it
was necessary to gain XP than money at the time.  Not because I am greedy,
but because I wanted to get something out of the way then go about doing
the money grind later.

What some people here are failing to grasp, especially you in this
situation, is the fact mistakes were made on both sides of the issue.  The
OP for blindly posting about this after realizing he didn't check to see
who he was dealing with.  He could have been scammed by someone just doing
it this way.  The Druid in question for not informing the player of his
intentions, which, by the way, was good, despite the fact the OP did not
get all the way to his intended destination.  And personally, the OP could
have gotten a hell of a lot worse than what he got, such as being dumped
somewhere else in Kunark, or out on the other side of Antonica, like Odus,
for instance and be made to go through hell trying to get onto an FP boat
or worse yet go through the chance of being burned further.

Wank all you want about it, and use as many analogies as you want.  The
bottom line is...  Both sides screwed up.
